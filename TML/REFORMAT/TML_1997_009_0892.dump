Speed of light.  Get a copy of the electromagnetic spectrum from a high
school physics textbook, and reach the chapeter on electromagnetic radiation;
it should explain all of these details in terms that a non-technical person
can easily understand.

(This isn\'t a put-down, by the way.  High-school texts are usually very good
introductions when you know nothing/little about a subject.)

Yup.  Not to mention showing you interior illustrations (by Rob Caswell) so
you can show them what the bridge etc _looks_ like.  I have several copies,
but won\'t sell any! 

Seriously, this book is well-worth getting.  For campaigns that spend a lot
of time on starships, it is an invaluable resource, providing lots of
background detail without slowing down gameplay.

I\'ve always assumed that most ships only accept passengers for one jump at a
time.  Thus, for me, this rule only concerns occasions when a ship captain
decides to accept passengers for several worlds (presumably because there
aren\'t enough passengers for just the next world).  I would furthermore rule
(if necessary) that such passages aren\'t transferable.

Thus, if I am trading from Echiste to Tureded via Pirema in a J1 ship, I
would look for passengers to Pirema.  If there aren\'t enough, I would also
look for passengers to Tureded, but I would still only charge the
Tureded-bound passengers one fare.  I get less money, they must spend longer
in transit.

I guess this means that I apply that rule to player-captains only, not
player-passengers.

IMHO, SOH is one of the best supplements produced for the Traveller
universe-- from a role-playing POV.  Very descriptive.

The 400% rule was based on the premise that thruster plates provide
100% thrust to the rear of the plates, tapering off sharply to 25%
along its edges (ie: perpendicular to the normal thrust axis), and
finishing up with 10% forwards (for braking, I guess).  a 1G maneuver
drive could normally produce only .25G while hovering.  The 400%
overdrive allows the ship to hover on a 1G world with its deck plates
aligned with the surface of the planet.

Overdrive is only capable for a few minutes at best, which won\'t
effect starship combat (using 30 minute turns) but which will allow
ships to take off vertically and orientate themselves so that they are
pointed skywards before ascending to orbit.

How do your free traders take off then?  I assume that maneuver rives
in your universe cannot pivot to produce 100-130% thrust in *any*
direction.  Since free traders aren\'t equipped with wings, do you use
the contragrav idea from TNE?

Not so as the ship repayments are higher for a high jump ship.

Most cargo probably only goes one hex or a least only has to travel one hex

I would expect Jump 1 vessels to make the bulk of the transport pool 
avaiable to traders.  This is why mains are so valuable and why being off a 
main really sucks.
(for the unintiated a main is a group of worlds linked on a J1 route).  I 
expect that most cargo shippers probably do send goods on the first 
starship travelling towards their detinsation and it is sent from world to 
world via J1 transport (not always the same ship).  However, going to the 
effort of travelling to a world J3 away from anywhere else should have some 
rewards.  And some cargos are time related (i.e. they spoil, or they are 
late fulfilling their contract to the Imperail Navy <gasp!>

Speculative trade is definately not covered by the increased shipping charges.  Thats why it\'s speculative :)

Actually, I wasn\'t trying to slight Mr Bailey, not at all!  At 100 meters
he\'s the "World\'s Fastest Human", no question about it..until somebody
breaks his record anyway.  ;-> 

I invoked Michael Johnson\'s name in relation to running that fast for 400+

OK, sarcasm aside, does that mean that the different refractive indexes for

Perhaps, but they\'ll be quite big, after you put enugh fuel to handle
station keeping in a GG, given the normal weather you find there. I\'d go
for putting them in orbit, as most GGs have at least small rings (assuming
our solar system is somewhat representative) so they could be hidden in them.

Three geosynchronous commsats will cover everything except for up/down by
the poles. They are also easy to use, because their relative postion
doesn\'t change. You can get better high latitude coverage by having them in
slightly tilted orbits, but then they move over time, so you need a more
sophisticated comms system.

Mesons don\'t interact with normal matter, so as long as they\'re targetted
at the communicator it doesn\'t matter whether or not the whole planet is in
between.

i agree.... i find that T4 needs more armour types.. i\'ve gone threw some
type\'s
like Combat Armour.. wich i like to use for my players... since nobody
wants them to
be using Battle Dress even though the TL-9 version isn\'t to bad.... for
PC\'s i would pre-
fer not to give it to them.. unless i knew i could regain it back... like
offer it for a mission
and make sure they hand it in again....

You could try my house rule: rolling 3 sixes on a task roll is automatic
failure, rolling 3 sixes and above your target is spectacular failure. For
example, if your target number is 20 and you roll 3 sixes, you
automatically fail even if the roll was less than 20. If you roll 3 sixes
and the roll is above 20 you fail spectacularly.

>You\'ve basically got two problems with tieing SF to skill level.
>First, the higher skill level, the lower chance you want SF to be.

The higher your target number, the lower the chance you will roll above it,
so my rule passes.

>The second problem you have is that, even if you come up with an
>inverse number, your probabilities are going to get smaller the more
>dice you throw.

The more dice you throw, the higher the average roll. Higher rolls have
higher probability of exceeding your target number, so with my rule the
probabilities get higher the more dice you throw.

My SF rule also makes highly skilled characters better at all tasks.
Consider characters with target numbers of 17 and 20. Under the regular
rules both characters perform identically with 3-die task rolls (using T4
or KBv2 tasks) since both can only fail spectacularly. But with my SF
system a roll of 18 would be a SF only for the first character, so the
better-skilled character does better on typical tasks. Rolling 3 or more
sixes on more difficult tasks will be a SF on 18 or more for the first
character, but only on 21 or more for the second character, so
highly-skilled characters do better again even on difficult tasks.

I beg to differ. A starship that jumps 2 parsecs instead of 1 will have 50%
larger and more expensive drives, and double jump fuel storage space and
cost. This will increase the cost of shipping and reduce the revenues from
passengers and cargo. Retrofitting a free trader with Jump-2 will increase
operating expenses slightly and reduce its earning potential by about 25%.
Also, Jump-1 is a lower tech level so the drives will be cheaper if you use
the Merchant Prince rules, plus they can be repaired or overhauled cheaper
on more planets.

>Ships with Jump-1 drives but fuel storage for multiple jumps will

Not true; Jump-1 and Jump-2 both take exactly one week and can make the
same number of trips per year. The difference is that Jump-2 costs more and
delivers less.

Most posters seem to charge the given rate for each jump. Unfortunately
even this will not make Jump-2 profitable because Jump-2 ships cost more
for less usable volume. Unless traders can charge more for longer jumps,
anyone who carries passengers or cargo over 1 parsec will go bankrupt. I
think they can charge more; if you were travelling 3 parsecs wouldn\'t you
be willing to pay a little more to get there in one week instead of 3?
Especially if the trip was in a cabin the size of a washroom.

**************************************************************************
Clergy (Civilian)
  Even in the 58th Century, people still have spiritual needs.  
  Your character is one of the people who attend to those needs.  
Prerequisites: 
  EDU 4+ and CHR 5+.  
  Philosophy/Theology 3+.  
First Term Skills: History 1, Leadership 2, Persuasion 2, 
  Philosophy/Theology 2, Psychology 1.  
Subsequent Term Skills: Charm, Determination, Social Science.  
All Terms 
Special Adventure: 8+ for Language, Medical, Explore, Fine Arts, 
  Interaction, Physical Science, Technician, Vehicle.  
Promotion: 7+, DM +1 if INT 6+.  
Contacts: One per term, any.  
Other Effects: +1 SOC per promotion.  

Gambler (Civilian) 
  From the earliest days of history, there have been those who made 
  their living at games of chance.  Why not your character, also?  
Prerequisites: 
  INT 6+ and CHR 6+.  
  Gambling 3+.  
First Term Skills: Gambling 2, Luck 2, Streetwise 1, Charm 2, 
  Perception 1.  
Subsequent Term Skills: Luck, Charm, Perception, Vice.  
All Terms 
Special Adventure: 8+ for Slug Weapon (Slug Pistol), Language, Crime, 
  Explore, Melee, Vehicle.  
Promotion: 8+, DM +1 if INT 8+, DM +1 if CHR 8+.  
Contacts: One per term, specialist (Gambling), criminal, entertainment, 
  or law enforcement.  
Other Effects: 
  Two Secondary activities per term.  
  +1 SOC per promotion.  
  When computing income, roll a Difficult test of Gambling: 
    Outstanding Success: Use 1D6 x Gambling asset instead of SOC.  
    Success: Use 1D3 x Gambling asset instead of SOC.  
    Failure: Use Gambling asset instead of SOC.  
    Catastrophic Failure: No income this term.  In addition, roll an 
      Average test of INT to avoid spending the next term in the 
      Prisoner career (1D3+1 terms if Catastrophic Failure for this 
      test of INT).  
  If Homeworld Tech = Early Stellar+, 1 ship DM per Special Adventure 
    for a Yacht.  

Reserve/Guard Force (Military) 
  This "career" is undertaken by an ex-military character at the *same* 
  time as he takes a civilian career.  
Prerequisites: 
  Prior military career.  
  Must meet all Prerequisites for that military career.  
  Must simultaneously serve in a civilian career that doesn\'t prohibit 
    secondary activities.  
  Cannot have any outstanding obligations of military service (from 
    Military/Flight Academies).  
All Terms 
Commission: As per the military career, with DM -2.  
Skills: As per the military career.  
Special Duty: As per the military career, with DM +2.  Having a Special 
  Duty for the military career prohibits having a Special Assignment in 
  the civilian career for that term.  
Promotion: As per the military career, with DM -2.  
Contacts: One per term, military.  
Other Effects: 
  Secondary activity must be chosen from Subsequent Terms Skills for the 
    military career.  
  Resolution of the civilian career is unaffected by this career (except 
    for Special Duty; see above).  
  The character receives half (round down) the usual number of ship DMs 
    from the military career.  

**************************************************************************
These careers mention a couple of new skills from my campaign.  

Luck (INT) - Determination: 
This skill functions just as described in a back issue of _TTC_ and in
Dark Conspiracy.  This skill is TNE\'s version of Jack-of-all-Trades.  

Philosophy/Theology (EDU) - Social Science: 
This skill functions just as described in T4.  

**************************************************************************
Also, for the various "illegal" careers (Criminal, Corsair, Rebel, etc.),
the number of terms served as a Prisoner *can* be more than one, depending
on just how bad the character fails its Average test of INT.

much wandering about the continent)...

Second:  someone inquired about penal colonies in Australia.  It\'s fairly
safe to say that most of the country was built on penal settlement.  Apart
from tghe Adelaide colony, (croweaters pride themselves today on never
having convicts), all colonies were at least partly penal settlements.  My
own state, Western Australia, was stagnating for the first twenty years
after it\'s founding in 1829, and was probably only saved by the decision to
introduce penal labour in 1850 (interestingly, about the same time that the
other colonies were weaning themselves off convicts).  Of course, the Swan
River colony didn\'t _really_ start to expand until the discovery of gold in
the state during the 1890\'s...

Interestingly, one of the original concepts behind penal settlement was
essentially humanitarian:  get the criminals out of the city slums, and
teach them useful skills so that they could become productive members of
society.  Many convicts, following the end of their terms, were given land
grants and were _strongly_ encouraged to stay in australia as
farmers...some became quite wealthy, and gained access to levels of society
that would have otherwise been totally inaccessible.

Thirdly:  I remember playing around with the \'Lucan lives\' concept a year
ago on this list.  I was thinking along the lines of an insane, decrepit
Lucan hooked up to machines to keep him alive, wanting oblivion, but denied
it by the machines that at once worshipped him as a god and despised him...

Heaven\'s no! ;-> They don\'t pivot, not *just* the drives anyway.

I have.  Actually, I\'ve done this several different ways over the years,
but this is what I\'ve settled on.

The ship (or vehicle) has a number of AG/IComp units built into it\'s inner
hull, beneath the armor.  These units create overlapping fields that cancel
the effects of outside gravity, inertial changes, and create gravity fields
of variable strength within the ship.

These units are generally rated at, at least, 1G and that\'s strong enough
to lift a ship straight up with a little overpowering.  Maybe only 1 or 2
m/s, but that\'s enough to get it off the surface and eventually into space. 
(This was the reason I asked whether most folks played 2G to mean 19.2mps,
or 2 x local gravity earlier.  ;->) Actually, virtually all ships in my
universe mount 2G, or higher, for the IComp so lift isn\'t that much of a
problem.

So, do my ships use the TNE CG concept..not quite.  Do they rotate the
drives..nope.  ;-> 

If I was using regular Thrusters I\'d go this route.  I\'d have the AG units
work like I describe to begin lift, but I\'d tip the nose up as the ship
lifts by overpowering the fore AGs and underpowering the aft ones.  The
Thrusters at the back would provide progressively more upward thrust as the
*ship* is rotated by the AG units into a virtical position.  You wouldn\'t
have to overpower the 1G Thruster if the AG/IComp units can provide enough
lift to offset most of local gravity.

Me being me, I work it differently.  I don\'t use regular Thrusters, mine
don\'t work in atmosphere or near a planet\'s surface.  The AG/IComp units
have to provide enough lift to get ships above the atmosphere, and a few
hundred km out before the maneuver drive will work.  So, I have to make
sure they can do it.  Because their ability to lift (push) is proportional
to the gravity source they are pushing against, they aren\'t going to fly
you around the system, though.

If this reminds folk of the ideas Leonard and friends were banding about
recently...it should.  ;-> I don\'t know if the details match, but what they
were discribing appears to match what I\'ve been doing with, admittedly,
made up numbers (don\'t tell anybody, I\'d lose status in the gearhead
community ;->).  I\'ve been waiting with baited breath for some numbers for
the push/pull AG units.

As an aside, I have spaceships perform like *pigs* trying to lift or land
using the AG units.  Air and interface craft use the AG and the IComp, but
they *thrust* by other means.  Ships in low orbits, too low for their
stutterjump drives to work, are easily outmaneuvered by rocket powered
interface craft, but not once they move out to high orbits and beyond!

One. In at least two of the four editions, probably more, the

will get you there faster and cheaper.

Two. With point one mind, consider this, most traders work to establish
a profitable trade routes. Higher jump ships will tend to find routes
that fits their higher range. Most often between high volume worlds
(Express).
While, lower jump ship will fill in the gaps (Locals).
If you have access to the Traveller Adventure the library data

    'body' => 'Yes it\'s true that a jump-n ship costs less and grosses more than a 
jump-(n+1) ship.  This means that freight and passenger haulage are 
attractive propositions for small jump-1 vessels, as operated by many 
PCs.

Where bigger, heftier ships make a killing is in cargo trading, i.e. 
speculative purchase and resale.  Higher jump connects routes of very 
profitable worlds -- an industrial world and a rich agricultural one, 
say.  This exploits the Book 8/MT/T4 trade system to the hilt: it\'s 
possible to make average profits of thousands of credits per ton (on 
average) on a regular basis.  If your firm includes a Broker-4 (and 
to run a big J3 trader, it should!) and keeps a large fraction of 
the brokerage fees, you\'ll be richer still.

Connecting larger, more attractive worlds directly means attracting 
more goods, freight and passengers on each world, supporting bigger 
ships with some economies of scale.

The existence of J3 trade routes between important planets means 
companies can ship their goods as freight, cutting out the shipowning 
stage.  Doesn\'t this actually *lose* the shipowners money, if their 
cargo space needs to generate more than Cr 1000 / ton?  Well, it can 
fill up a cargo hold which would be empty due to sparse supplies of 
cargo, and reduce losses.  However, there\'s a way to make money off 
freight: brokerage.  If your freight customers use your firm for 
brokerage, you can make up to about 10% of the cargo\'s value.

We deduce (as GDW before us) that high-jump shipping lines are 
primarily cargo-and-brokerage outfits, with passengers as a 
profitable sideline and freight filling gaps in the cargo hold.
In addition, high-jump routes attract subsidies in a way that J1 
mains should not (I don\'t like to subsidise Subsidised Merchants!)
in order to support the fast flow of freight.

All of this explains why Imperial Shipping\'s _Adrenal_ class modular 
freighter is attracting trade subsidies from His Imperial Majesty\'s 
Government and orders from Tukera lines.  A jump-3 ship optimised for 
a fast turnaround, it makes a modest profit even as a subsidised 
freighter.  As a cargo-carrier with established brokerage and support 
facilities at all destinations, it\'s extremely lucrative.

And it\'s a design I was going to send to JTAS.  However, no point in 
that until a definitive and less broken ship design system exists.  
So after I finish off Imperial Shipping\'s THUDDD entry (just needs 
typing) I might be persuaded to post the _Adrenal_.  [I think that 
means "bully me until I do", in effect...]

Hey, didn\'t somebody just post a while back that they wished they
had HG?

A friend bought a set of CT books and has an extra HG.  Not being in
the CT for money business, he\'ll sell it for what he paid for
it----$1.

Any takers?  It\'ll take a $0.55 stamp to mail, I imagine.

hit the outskirts of the Regency.  What will happen to psions then?

The way i think things will happen is that there will be a 4th imperium, 
composed of the Regency and whats left of the Zhodani Sphere.  As psions go 
on insane rampages, there will be the 2nd psionic suppressions.  Those

There is one major variable: The larger a starship is, the cheaper it is to
carry passengers and freight PROVIDED it is more or less full on each trip.
If there are only a few passengers then a smaller ship is more competitive.
So the price would vary according to the average traffic (and seasonal peak
traffic will complicate things  beyond what I want to deal with).

You\'re misinterpreting the rule. A ticket is for one jump, regardless of
distance. Not for one trip of several jumps. The "announced destination"
is the ship\'s next port of call, not the passenger\'s ultimate destination.

I posted this a couple of months ago. I did begin to design some jump-1, -2,
and -3 200 T freighters and liners with QSDS 1.4/5 in order to make just
those calculations, but after having to redo them the third time due to
errors in the QSDS figures (well, two errors in the system and one mistake
by me ;-) I lost the thread. I fully intend to finish the designs and some
similar larger designs and do the calculations, but at the moment I\'m busy
with other pursuits.

Here you are, then:

(Note: I plan to make some minor changes to this article based on comments
I recieved last time, but I haven\'t had time yet.)

              Basic starship economics for Traveller in Milieu 0
              ==================================================

Starship tickets
================

Ticket prices for regular passenger liners can vary trememdously with local
conditions. Monopolies can allow a line to raise prices far above the
average while price wars can temporarily press the prices down to where they
won\'t even cover the liner\'s expenses. But to give the referee an idea of
what prices are reasonable, here are a few rules of thumb.

To calculate the price of a starship ticket figure out the yearly operating
expenses of a ship (including a fair profit to provide a return for the money
invested in the ship) and divide it by the number of passengers carried over
the year.

A liner\'s expenses consists of:

1) Crew salaries
2) Crew life support
3) Passenger life support
4) Jump fuel
5) Yearly maintenance
6) Port fees
7) Misjump insurance
8) Profit

CREW SALARIES are very high for technical starship personnel: Astrogators,
engineers, pilots, and electronics crew. The Cr86,400 per year a captain of a
medium-sized ship earns is more than 8 times the earnings of an average
planetbound citizen; if adjustments are made for the fact that food and board
is in addition to the salary, the ratio becomes even more skewed. Starship
pilots, astrogators and technical crew traditionally earns a lot; (they have
very strong union, perhaps?) Service crew (medics and stewards) are not paid
quite as well, but the room and board helps a lot. 

Base monthly pay for starship crew is: 

Captain         6000
Pilot           6000
Astrogator      5000
Technician      4000
Medic           2000
Steward         1000

Each extra rank level adds 10% of the base pay to the salary. There must be 
at least one higher-ranking crewmember for each six crewmembers (round off).
There must be one yet-higher-ranking crewmember for each six of those (round
off) and so on. finally, each department must have a department head that is
one rank higher than the highest-ranking other member of the department. 

Example: An engineering department with sixty members. Ten of those must be
of higher rank than the others. Of those ten, two must be of yet higher rank.
And of those two, one must be the Chief Engineer. So the department has fifty
crewmembers recieving Cr4000 per month, eight recieving Cr4400, one recieving
Cr 4800 and one recieving Cr 5200.

The captain of a ship counts as one rank higher than his highest-ranking
department head. The captain of the ship in the example above would propably
recieve Cr8400/month.

Skill levels does not affect salaries except insofar that a highly skilled
engineer can get a berth as a Chief Engineer on a Tukera Liner while his
less skilled colleague must make do with a job on a rusty old scow; but if
the highly skilled engineer for some reason took a job on a scow he\'d not
get a higher salary because of his high skill.

Add all monthly salaries and multiply by 12 to get the yearly salaries paid.

CREW LIFE SUPPORT
Add the life support for all crewmembers for the whole year. The Cr4000 per
month that the basic rules calls for is far more expensive than I can account
for. Personally I find it difficult to justify Cr1000 per month, but YMMV.
Certainly the crew must be eating like epicures (Cr600 per month buys you
luxury food; what else is so expensive that it costs Cr3400 per month?)

PASSENGER LIFE SUPPORT
Add the life support for the maximum possible number of passengers for a year 
and multiply by the percentage of utilization that the starship is expecting
(most regular passenger lines expect their ships to be between 80 and 90%
full each trip).

JUMP FUEL
Regular passenger starships usually make 35 sceduled jumps per year if they
fly surface to surface and 40 per year if they only go from jump limit to
jump limit. They always buy refined fuel to save time. Note btw. that if
produced in large quantities it costs less than Cr5 per ton to refine fuel.
So even if they have to buy it at Cr100 per ton, someone is making a
killing on that refined fuel. If the unrefined fuel can be picked up more or
less for free in a nearby ocean, the profits are even greater.

YEARLY MAINTENANCE
Yearly maintenance costs 1/1000th of the ship\'s puchase price.

PORT FEES is another way the locals can get some money out of the starship
trade. The Cr100 the basic rules take for berthing fees seems awfully low
to me. Surely it costs a bit to keep a starport running?

MISJUMP INSURANCE
Even when the drive is top-tuned and every possible precaution have been 
taken, misjumps occur occasionally. Unprovoked misjumps have roughly 1 chance
in 216 to occur each jump. Fortunately, not all misjumps automatically 
results in the complete loss of the ship. Results vary from the loss of a
single jump\'s revenue (when the jump takes you to a neighbouring star system
with full facilities) over the loss of a full year\'s revenue (when the jump
takes you 36 parsecs away) over the loss of a sizable fraction of the ship\'s
value in repairs and salvage (when the ship winds up in deep space with
slagged engines) to the aforementioned complete loss. On the average a
misjump works out to cost 1/1000th of the ship\'s value. For simplicity\'s sake
ignore the fact that ships lose in value as they grow older (by a staggering 
coincidence the risk of an unprovoked misjump goes up commensurately as the
value of the ship goes down).

Misjump insurance comes to 1/1000th of the ship\'s value per jump.

PROFIT
Profit is the return on the money invested expected by the people who owns
the ship. If there is a loan in the ship, some of the profit goes to pay the
bank loans, if not, it goes to the owner. In any case the profit amounts to
6.25% per year unless local conditions differ markedly from the Imperial
average.

A liner\'s revenues are the price of all tickets sold. Number of tickets sold
is the maximum number of passengers carried multiplied by the utilization
percentage.

The price of a ticket is the expenses divided by the number of tickets sold.

STANDARD TICKET PRICES

A referee who wishes to avoid all those tedious calculations should make one
simple assumption: That any regular passenger liner the PCs need to board is
the size it is because it can fill its staterooms 80-90% per trip on the
average and that there are no special circumstances like monopolies, state
subsidies, price wars, seasonal fluctuations etc. Then all the Referee has to
do is to decide on the size of ship that would reasonably service whatever
route is involved and check this table:

                                    Mid      High
                                  Passage   Passage
200 T Jump-1 Liner:                6,000     8,000
200 T Jump-2 Liner:                8,000    10,000
200 T Jump-3 Liner:               10,000    12,000
  
[That\'s as far as I got, and the prices above are based on faulty designs to
boot. Still, the prices shouldn\'t be that far from correct.]

Remember that a Free Trader works the cracks between the regular liners
and freighters. The prices above will merely establish the framework in
which they operate.

Except that if the trade/traffic to support it is there, then there will
already be Jump-2 freighters and liners.

Incidentally, for jump-1 distances jump-1 ships are more economic.

The ship payments are bigger (considerably so) and the payload is smaller
for higher-jump ships.

Sure. The problem is that the current rules dosen\'t allow the jump-2 
captain to charge more per passenger for a 2-parsec jump even though his
expenses are higher and the number of passengers less.

These would effectively be mines, yes/no? Its a good idea, mine the gas 
giant, but it would probably be a bit difficult to cover all the possible 
zones for fuel skimming. Unless you can only do this in certain places in 
the atmosphere. I\'ve never read anything about exactly how fuel skimming 
works in "canon" so is this possible.

    'body' => 'OK,

so, I went home last night and dug out my copies of High Guard 
and the T4 main rulebook. I didn\'t bother digging out MT, as I assume
it\'s more or less the same as HG and I don\'t have a copy of anything
TNE-ish, except for FF&S, which doesn\'t have any combat info in it.

So.

High Guard Meson Weapons

The Meson gun is first available as a spinal mount at TL 11.
100 Ton Meson Bays are available at TL 13 (I believe)
 50 Ton meson Bays at TL 15.

The Meson screen becomes available at TL 12 (Factor 1 only)
It improves at higher TLs (Factors 2-3 at TL 12, 4-6 @ TL 14, 7-9 @ TL 15)
Meson screen are expensive, 40-80 MCr (Factor 1/TL 12 being 80 I think)
and they take up a lot of space (90 Tons for Factor 1, less at higher TLs)

In combat, even the _smallest_ meson gun (factor 3) has a chance of hitting
a ships with the _highest_ meson screen.

The way it works is that you roll 3 times to hit with a meson weapon:
1 ) to hit
2 ) to "penetrate configuration"
3 ) to penetrate screens

There are various DMs, but the most important one is that you get a +DM
on penetration based on the relative size of your computer. Therefore,
although you have to roll an 18+ on 2D to penetrate a factor 9 meson
screen with a factor 3 meson gun, if you have a Model 9 computer and
he\'s got a model 3 or lower, it _is possible_.

Note that once penetrated, meson screens do not affect how much damage
you take (again, if I\'m wrong, please correct me on this point).

The way damage works in HG, for every factor over 9,
your gun gets an additional damage roll, which for meson guns is
actually two rolls - one for radiation damage, one for interior explosion.

Additionally, for every point that the weapon\'s factor exceeds the 
target\'s size factor, you get a roll on the critical hit table. A 
factor T meson gun firing on a 1000 Ton ship that hits and penetrates
would get 18 rolls on both the rad. damage and interior explosion tables,
plus about 16 rolls on the critical hit table. That is serious damage.

Finally, as we all know (now) armour has no affect on meson hits, except
for maybe being blown off by explosions once in a while.

Now, for T4,

Compared to lasers, in terms of damage, meson guns are really weak.
This is primarily the fault of FF&s, which really made lasers the
weapon of choice (ie. the most powerful).

The biggest Meson spinal mount in SSDS has a rating of about 3-2-1-0,
with a rating of 4 at very short range. That\'s crap. You can get
TL 9 lasers that do more damage. Additionally, the meson guns listed
all do the same damage at all TLs - the designers chose to hold the 
damage constant and vary the size/power consumption I suppose.

In QSDS, there is no TL associated with meson screens! In SSDS
the is, but the SSDS table I have doesn\'t list a USP value. It does
list some other mysterious values which if converted using the
USD conversion chart come out close to the QSDS values. In SSDS,
meson screens are available at TL 12 that have a USD rating 
(I guess) of 11.

The way that meson screens work is that if a meson guns hits, the
meson screen factor is subtracted from the meson gun damage rating.
This means that a TL 12 ship can protect itself from _ANY MESON GUN_
completely and utterly. Yuck! This is a combination of the weakening
of meson guns and the apparent beefing up of meson screens. According
to QSDS, all it takes is a meson screen with a volume of 8 or 17 tons
and that\'s it - you\'re 100% safe. 

Finally, my misunderstanding of T4 space combat came from the following
line (T4 main rulebook, p. 119),

  "if a hit is successful... the damage is applied to the target
   ship\'s armour."

However, later on, this statement is, um, overridden later on with
the statement,

  "Meson guns that do damage bypass armour, and the damage is
   applied directly to the structure of the ship instead. Also,
   roll on the Interior Explosion column for each hit."

So, comparing T4 to HG, meson screen technology is a hell of a lot better
in M0 than it is in the late Imperium. Also, meson guns, although they
won a number of wars for the Terrans, still have a long way to go in
the next 1100 years of Imperial weapons development. Finally, it looks
like it gets harder to hit with meson weapons, but that they\'re a lot
deadlier in 1100.

All of these changes, I assume, come from the various things that FF&S did.
As much as I like FF&S in concept, it is still playing fast and loose
with previous Traveller "canon" and is really fucking up the way
that things are supposed to work. Or, it\'s fucking up the way things
_used_ to work. Traveller _used_ to be really good for internal
consistency. I really hope that all you people doing development for IG
currently who read this list either start trying a bit harder to keep
things consistent or stop calling the game "Traveller" because it isn\'t.

Please stop repeating the mistakes of TNE (not that TNE was all bad, but
it had it\'s moments).

Grumping,
Ethan

I vaguely remember a quote in Vampire fleets with reference to the
Vampire Highway and virus pilgrims, in that they are making a
pilgrimage to Cymbeline, where many of them are infected with a
Doomslayer strain which returns towards the core "to fight Lucan".

At the time I thought this wording was a little strange, but now it
becomes clearer.  Virus is pissed, and it knows where Lucan lives.

Yep. You can calculate the speed of light in a given medium using its
refractive index and vice-versa. You can also see the same phenomenom
in water - wave speed in water is a function of the depth of the water
and if you have a wave going from a deeper part to a shallower part 
(assuming a sudden rise) you\'ll see the wave change direction, due to the
change in speed. Although I can\'t do all the math off the top of my head,
it\'s all pretty easy to prove with high-school level trig.

And, several other people said the same thing.

I guess I wasn\'t clear in what I was saying here.  I wasn\'t comparing 
costs between two ships--one with Jump-1 and one with Jump-2.

I was comparing one J-2 ship--that ship making a one parsec jump or a 
two parsec jump.  The costs are the same for that ship no matter what 
jump he makes.

Terry,

Here is what I got from Greg Porter the designer of CSC/VDS/
- ----
30G 6904 tons thrust
234 tons mass

Going by interperitation of the formula it would be 
(6904/234)*3000=88,539 meters per turn. This seems very high.
I have tried to reverse design some of the Grav vehicles in the book to no
avail.

Thanks

Sam Thomas
>>

for this it would be an acceleration of 30g. The top speed of the grav
vehicle is (*megawatts of power*/234 tons mass) x 3000 x half acceleration
(in this case 30/2=15). Since thrust plates have a power consumption of 1Mw
per 40 tons thrust, and you have a thrust of 6904 tons, I assume power output
is 172.6Mw, which would give a top speed of (172.6/234) x 3000 x 15 =
33192m/turn. Of course, if I\'m right, it also means your 234 ton vehicle has
172.6 tons of thruster plates and 36 tons of TL12 Fusion+. You may be going
somewhere in a hurry, but you\'re not carrying much.

All this is in the Propulsion paragraph on p.63.

Ha!  Now, that\'s an interesting idea, and one I haven\'t seen bandied about. 
Big bad warships have always had thick armor, to protect them from surface
hitters, and main weapons that ignored the thick armor. But if the magic
cannon not only ignores the thick armor but uses it as a containment vessel
for explosions inside the ship, then maybe you want thin armor on ships
going up against meson guns....but now you\'re more vulnerable to lasers,
paws and missiles.  That\'s an interesting tradeoff worth thinking about.

Perhaps this is what the Vilani Fleets ran up against when the Terrans came
after them with meson spinal warships.  The Vilani with thick armor,
optimized to prevent hull penetration, contained the meson explosions
within their ships and this did *much* more overpressure damage than if
most of the energy had blasted out into space.

Meson cannon generally have shorter ranges than paws and lasers, though,
don\'t they?  So, you can\'t build *thin* hulled warships either or the enemy
will stand off and pop your hull from long range.

Interesting...but I don\'t, yet, like meson cannon.  I\'m open to
reconsideration of my opinion, though.

Aha!  Another recruit!  I don\'t have the subscription info handy, but will
repost it tonight.  We\'ve made quite a lot of progress towards sketching
out Vilani phonology and basic grammar, but things have died down recently.
Hopefully that will change in the next few days, though.

>(Perosnaly i think Vilani is opposite Welsh, they use TOO MANY vowels! <G>)

Try Hawai\'ian for vocalic overkill <G>.

Like we were discussing on the TravLang list, though, this is really true.
Take a name like "Sharikkumar" written without tone markings (as all Vilani
words are in published Traveller, unfortunately).  There are four vowels in
the word, each of which can occur in one of six tones -- so, 6^4 = 1296
phonemically distinct, possibly meaningful Vilani words are transcribed in
\'Galanglic\' as "Sharikkamur".  In theory, of course.

I recently downloaded MSIE 4.0 the other day but I still don\'t like
their newsreader.  Consequently, I\'m sticking with Agent 1.0 for my

Hmmm...this is the genesis of an adventure I have, half finished, on my
hard drive. See, there were other intelligent chips on Cymbeline, not just
the strain that the Imperium used for their transponders, or for creating
Virus. One is hooked up to a large memory bank and achieves sentience, but
without the restrictions that the Imperial strains have.

Then the Imperium, Lucan\'s forces, in fact, come and commit genocide
against its race, by nuking the volcanic highlands of Cymbeline, then the 
captive ones on Research station Omicron are driven mad and twisted into
Virus.

Yep, it\'s pissed all right, and strictly speaking, it\'s NOT Virus. Where
do you think the Peacemaker strain came from, anyway? ;-)

Yes I do like large, apocalyptic, cinematic adventures.

All the clues are there, too, scattered through most canon resources,
primarily Vampire fleets and Survival Margin (SM, IMO, is the single best
background source of any Traveller supplement ever. There\'s SO damn much
there, overt and between the lines, that even a not-so-inventive ref can
mine it for years worth of adventures.)

Excellent post snipped!

Hans, I might quibble with some of your numbers, foex I have
different ideas about salaries, but this is an excellent job.  Me, being
me, I won\'t adhere to hard and fast rules, but as guidelines on fixed and
variable costs these are very good.

I know Free Traders work the cracks, and outside established trade routes.
OTOH, their fixed costs are...well, fixed, and their variable costs are
still proportional to the cargos/passengers they *do* carry.  Speculative
trade (and chartered passage) are probably all that keeps them profitable
though.  

The 6.25% profit figure you suggest isn\'t what I\'d call profit, I think
what you\'re describing is cost of capital.  The note on the ship will
probably eat all of that 6.25, and if you\'ve paid off the note it will go
toward the replacement cost of the ship.  The actual profit is anything
left over from revenue after all expenses, including principle and interest
on notes and any desired
replacement costs, have been paid.

Sure, a businessman will have a desired ROI, and if they don\'t consistently
get it they\'ll put their money someplace else.  I can accept ~6% as an
average desired ROI, but that\'s going to vary from owner to owner.  Some
people will take a lower return on their investment if they get to be their
own boss, "do their own thing", and/or get psychic satisfaction out of
their situation..this describes anybody that owns a Free Trader to me. ;->

Well, you\'re close..  The only thing the Imperium provides is the TL 14-15
equipment, and the off-planet training.  The units themselves are raised
and maintained by the planetary defence command.

If a world has, say, 200 regiment sized units, about 20 of those will be
designated as "Imperial", and recieve upgraded weaponry.  The competition
to enter these units will be fierce, as they will be percieved as the
premeire assignment for most worlds.  The planetary government benefits by
having a dedicated, high-tech force that only needs to be paid and housed,
since the Imperium is picking up the bill for all equipment.

Such a regiment might do hostile enviroment traing in its own system, and
maybe do a yearly deployment as part of a larger excercise to another
system.  (Think of the US Army\'s Reforger or Team Spirit events.)

When war comes, the Imperial Regiments are formed into larger units, and
placed under the command of Imperila Army General officers.  This still
leaves the world 90% of its ground defense force.

In my view, the largest operational unit of the Army is at the subsector
level.  Subsector commanders are selected from the various worlds\'
militaries, and tend to be long service professionals with a history of
Imperial service.  (The commander of NATO comes to mind as an analogy)

Some quick calculations:
Preserved food costs Cr20 per man-day (from CT, I couldn\'t find food prices
in MT or TNE, and I don\'t have T4).
The refill for a TL12 Vacc suit air tank costs Cr10 and lasts 24hrs with
recycling.

This gives a cost of Cr30 per man-day of life support, and Cr900 per 30 day
month. However given that these prices are for small retail lots I can\'t
see any reason why starship life support should cost more than about Cr500
per month. This means that either the port suppliers have a 800% markup, or
ships use onepass openended lifesupport systems, which seems very unlikely,
at least for thier O2.

Does anyone know what the consuimption figures for Skylab or the Soviet
stations are like? They\'d give a rough idea (for TL7, anyway).

I suspect that a lot of the \'standard\' prices are set by the Imperium, in
its role as a trade regulator. I also think that the high prices of fuel
only apply to small companies, and are set this high because of
Megacorporate pressures (to keep small traders marginal). Actually I\'ve
just realised - of course the costs only apply to small companies, the
Magacorps will have their own facilities at all their stopoffs.

Any particular reason for 6.25% ?

Not if fuel costs Cr500 per ton. At that price a jump-2 costs Cr5000 per
100t displacement more than a jump-1.

Actually it\'s because of the way T4 rates weapons - in TNE Meson guns did a
reasonable amount of damage (though nothing like Lasers or, at the high
end, Particle Accelerators), but had stink range until quite high TLs.

Again not a TNE problem, except for a dumb rule in Battle Rider that nobody
I know uses. In TNE Meson screens are still an all-or-nothing defence, like
in HG.

Even if you artifically constrain the cost of passage/cargo to be the
same regardless of distance... In the Traveller universe, they have
presented the magacorps as running high jump, high profits lines with
tramp freighters trying to eek out a living with low jump ships.
However, the economics in the rules work the other way around.

True enough.  This was true in TNE, too, BTW.

This was true in Brilliant Lances as well, but was changed

A MG hit in CT was typically a mission kill (if not an actual kill)
on the target.  This is the way I like it :-)

Assuming you don\'t limit lasers to TL*50 for the DE.  Otherwise
making anything but a laser in FFS is crazy.

The biggest mount in QSDS should be about the size of a bay MG in
CT... think about that in comparison.  A CT bay MG with a factor of
3 will only do critical hits on ships below 300 tons!

Screens should come in at TL12, I believe.

The T4 combat rules (in the main book) are completely useless, as
well as broken.  It isn\'t worth wasting electrons talking much more
about it :-)

No.  Not at all.  The problem is in the combat system, not FFS.

This is plain wrong.  While there were plenty of canon screw-ups in
FFS, this was not one of them.  To test FFS vs. canon, play
Brilliant Lances.  The T4 combat system paid no attention to canon
at all.  It was broken in beta (the couple days it _was_ beta) and
was broken as printed.

The T4 combat system has nothing to do with the ship design systems
(any of them) as a result, it is screwed up.  Try the Role Playing
Space Combat System available on the net, it is far better.

Aurelian Industries Announces Excess Starships Available
Aurelia Downport, Sylea (Sylean News Service) - Aurelian Industries, a
privately-held shipbuilding concern headquartered in the Wardn barony of
Sylea, announced today that it was brokering the sale of 11 large merchant
starships.  The ships, all of the Connestoga class, were sold by Aurelian
Industries to Star Routes, Ltd 20 years ago.  Since the record-breaking
public offering of Star Routes stock last year, analysts have been
expecting a major upgrade of the Star Routes mercantile fleet.  Aurelian
Industries, whose current head Alyn Wardn is the brother-in-law of the head
of Star Routes, has secured disposal rights on the current Star Routes
fleet, and analysts predict the majority of Star Routes\' new ships will
come from Aurelian Industries.

The Connestoga ships being offered have been the backbone of the Star
Routes fleet since it began to push into the megacorporate level 20 years
ago.  The ships serve the major trade routes of the Sylean Main, stopping
at all 24 Star Routes hubs.  These hubs then employ smaller trade ships to
service the local worlds surrounding the hub.  It is expected that the
replacement vessels will be larger than the 2000 ton Connestoga, and may
employ a more traditional multi-role single-hull strategy.  The 11 ships
being offered amount to half of the Star Routes\' Connestoga inventory,
leading analysts to predict a second offering in the next few years.

The Connestoga class has seen a great deal of controversy in its lifetime.
Unlike normal ships, the Connestoga is little more than an engine, and
depends on Pods attached to the ship to provide cargo and passenger
capacity, and even fuel for extended jumps.  Fears of jump-space
instability proved groundless, but the class was a favorite target of
pirates, resulting in their upgrade 14 years ago to the current version.
Previous versions of the Connestoga carried only 6 laser turrets and 1
missile turret, which were not tied into batteries.  The Imperial Navy
partly financed the defensive upgrade after the destruction of the ISS
Temperance Glory, a Connestoga-class vessel carrying Lady Elaine Gormanic,
a neice of the Emperor.  This resulted in the controversial use of Meson
Screens on the surviving Connestogas.

According to the Aurelian Industries spokesman, Linus Ishigli, there are 82
pods being offered as well.  Details on the numbers and types of pods were
unavailable at press time, but Ishigli promised that all of the pods were
being refurbished to new condition, and that multiple representatives of
each pod type were to be offered.  Ishigli also noted the prices expected
to be charged for the ships and gear:

                                     * Performance varies by carried
tonnage

The Connestoga class serves as the core of the modular freighter package.
The ship is capable of carrying six pods or modules; two are carried
in-line dorsally, and four others are carried in a two by two formation on
the vessel\'s belly.  The Connestoga and its supporting pod/modules are
designed to serve worlds with established starport facilities, but when the
Fuel/Cargo Module is employed, the vessel can service almost any location.

Jump and Maneuver performance varies on the Connestoga, depending on
current load and the number of Cargo Pods (or half Pocs) devoted to
carrying Jump Fuel.  The following performance ratings apply:

Total       Jump w/  Jump w/  Jump w/  Jump w/  Jump w/  Jump w/

The Connestoga Pods are all based on a 500-ton Streamlined Box hull.
Although not intended to land, the Pods are all equipped with Contragravity
Lifters to aid in moving, storing, mounting and dismounting the Pods in
space.  While not equipped with avoinics, all meet or exceed Imperial
minimum guidelines for sensor and communications gear, and are fully
independant from the mother ship\'s power and life support needs.  Each
Pod\'s crew is housed in the Pod, although accessways are available to allow
movement between the Pod and the mother ship.

The Connestoga Pods are designed to be mounted or dismounted at a starport
or other orbital/deep-space facility.  Once mounted, they function as if
they were part of the ship, until dismounted.  Dismounting a Pod requires
six hours of EVA work, and will require at least 4 space-suited technicians
and a orbital tug or other auxillary spacecraft capable of towing a 500-ton
load.  Mounting a Pod requires the same resources, but will take 12 hours
to complete.   Many times, excess or damaged pods are refurbished and used
as modular components for orbital or deep space facilities; often being
used to service other Pods still being carried on Connestogas.
.
There are 5 different Pods, and one Module:

  1.  The Cargo Pod.

                                          .4 Power (100 MW)
                                          1.1 Fuel
                                          Basic Sensors (A1 P3 J0)
                                          10 Armor
                                          14 Structure

      The Cargo Pod requires a crew of 4; an Engineer, an Electronics tech,
      a Steward and a Command crewman.  All are housed in individually in
      the pod\'s 4 Small Staterooms.

      This Pod can be used to carry cargo, fuel or a combination of the
two.
      Pods intended to carry a combination often employ a permanent divider
      to avoid the expense of cleaning an area of fuel residue or cleaning
      a cargo area to prevent fuel contamination.  Another common
modification
      is for the pod to carry permanent collapsable tanks, which collapse
to
      10% of their "full" volume and can be carried as cargo.  In general,
      Connestoga fuel loads are rated in Full Pods (400 tons) and Half Pods
      (200 tons).  In reality, the pod can carry more, but most captains
will
      try to carry some cargo tonnage on as many pods as possible.


  2.  The Passenger Pod.
      Tons:  500 Std (Box SL)   Volume:   7,000 M3  Cost: 54.22838 MCr

                                          14 Structure

      The Passenger Pod requires a crew of 10: 1 Engineer, 1 Electronics
      Tech, 1 Command Crew, 5 Stewards and 2 Medics.  All crewmen are
      assigned to one of the 10 small staterooms.  The Pod also has 90
      Large staterooms, each of which can carry 1 High Passenger or 2
      Medium Passengers.  The Pod also features a 25-ton Recreation and
      Entertainment facility, equipped with the finest virtual gaming
      and casino facilities.  There are also 6 Low Berths to handle medical
      emergencies.

  3.  The Low Berth Pod.

                                          14 Structure

      The Low Berth Pod requires a crew of 26: 1 Engineer, 1 Electronics
      Tech, 1 Command crew, 2 Stewards and 21 medics.  The large number of
      medics required by Imperial law for low-berth passengers are often
      "seconded" to other positions in other pods aboard ship during the
      jump.  All crew are assinged individual Small Staterooms (25
available),
      but the Command crewman is assigned the Pod\'s only available Large
      Stateroom.

  4.  The Lander Pod.  Requires a crew of 13, and carries 4 100-ton
landers.

      The Lander Pod requires a crew of 26: 1 Engineer, 1 Electronics Tech,
      1 Command crew, 8 Small Craft crew and 1 Steward.  The crew are
      assigned individual Small Staterooms (13 available).  The Pod carries
      4 Buckboard-class Landing Shuttles, each displacing 100 tons.  The
      shuttle specifications are:

          The Buckboard class Landing Shuttle is a popular STO (surface to
orbit)
          cargo hauler.  A common variant replaces 50 tons of cargo with
100 seats,
          good for trips of 24 hours or less.  The craft requires a pilot
and a
          flight engineer, who doubles as crew chief when the vessel is not
flying.
          A single Small Stateroom is available for the crew.


  5.  The Escort Pod.
      Tons:  500 Std (Box SL)   Volume:   7,000 M3  Cost: 271.3403 MCr

      4x 20-ton Fighters                  14 Structure

      The Escort Pod was a special-order item; ten were made for the
Imperial Navy.
      These pods look identical to a standard Cargo Pod externally, and
were
      deployed on Connestoga vessels loaned to the Imperial Navy for
anti-piracy
      patrols.  The intent was to lure greedy pirates into an attack on a
large,
      inviting target, and then to open up with missiles and send fighters
out
      to destroy or capture the pirate vessel.  These operations lasted
four years
      and met with some success.  The Escort Pods were all retained by the
      Imperial Navy and are currently being used as components of several
orbital
      facilities along the Sylean Main.  The Pod has a crew of 50: 1
Engineer, 1
      Electronics tech, 8 Gunners, 9 screen operators, 8 Flight crew, 12
Marines,
      8 Command crew, 2 Stewards and a Medic.  The Pod has 4 20-ton Minimal
hangars,
      and several reload salvoes of missiles in the cargo bay.

                                          14 Structure

      Unlike the Connestoga Pods, the Fuel/Cargo Module is a spacecraft in
its own
      right, capable of 1G of thrust and able to land and wilderness
refuel.  Like
      the Buckboard lander, the Hansom-class is often used to refuel the
mother ship.
      The craft requires a crew of 6: 1 Engineer, 1 Electronics Tech, 2
Maneuver, 1
      Command crew and 1 Steward.  Each crewman is assinged to one of the
six Small
      Staterooms on board.

There is such a thing as overkill.  If I had a ship I would regard
having thin armor to let the blast get _out_ of my ship as "too
little, too late".  I would be more interested in thick armor
to stop other attacks and finding a way of avoiding meson hits
in the first place.

	It shouldn\'t be sending anything in MIME *or* UUENCODE. That ridiculous

useless to 75% or more of the people on the list, and just generally wastes

	While I fully agree with your call for better internal 
consistency from IG, I think you\'ve misplaced your ire as to what is 
"f*cking up" Traveller.

A Brief History:
Around this time last year, Don Perrin introduced himself to the list and 
asked if anyone could provide him with some CT computer tables he was 
missing so that he could include them in T4.  A number of people were 
very vocally opposed to going back to this system and advocated instead a 
simplified system fully compatible with FF&S.  Perrin gave people on the 
list a week to come up with something. 

Astonishingly, the Beta-list, lead by Dave Golden and Derek Wildstar, 
came up with the now familiar QSDS and SSDS in just a little over a 
week.  Following Perrins instructions, they were completely compatible 
with FF&S, execept for the changes introduced by the T4 background.  Both 
these systems as published are short on explanatory and descriptive text 
because IG was supposed to fill that in.

Perrin also asked that a brief Universal Ship Descriptor be developed 
that could be used with the combat system, but gave us little guidance on 
what that combat system would look like other than that it would be kinda 
like HG.  This is where most of the problems started. 

The Techy Stuff
The Ship Design and Space Combat systems are both representations of 
physical reality in the Trav universe and therefore are intimately 
connected.  Unfortunately, Don Perrin created a Space Combat system that 
used a representation of the Trav universe which was not consistent with 
that used by the Ship Design system.

Fire, Fusion, & Steel, and its two simplifications QSDS and SSDS, are 
both internally consistent and consistent with past Trav canon. You can 
check this by looking at SSDS, which uses raw FF&S numbers.

An example: 
In SSDS a basic TL-12 laser turret and a 5000Mj Meson Gun
	95 Mj Laser	5:  28	10:24
	5000Mj MG	5: 177	10:88
The MG is clearly superior, right?

The problem comes when lasers are combined into batteries.  What happens 
in the world of FF&S is that batteries all fire on the same target and 
roll to hit only once, but that each laser does damage separately.  In 
T4, the lasers magically combine into one big laser and do damage 
together.  

This will always do more damage than one big weapon because of the way 
damage and input energy are related.  Damage goes as the square root of 
input energy.  So putting 5000Mj into a single MG gets you 177 damage, 
while putting 5000Mj into 50 lasers gets you a total of 1200 damage.

In FF&S, that 1200 points of damage is divided into 50 little pin-pricks 
that cannot even penetrate the armor on a military ship, but in the T4 
translation, all that damage gets lumped together into one giant 
wave-motion gun.

Finally, everyone please remember that QSDS and SSDS are supposed to only 
be for ships up to 5000 tons, or Adventurer Class Ships as the original 
T4 ad copy described it.  They do not have the weaponry to build real 
battleships and linear extraplotations from them as to what battleships 
look like will be flawed.

Heres a comparison between that same laser and a _real_ Meson Gun:
	95Mj laser	5:  28	10: 24
	100,000Mj MG	5:1581	10:845
This Meson Gun is designed for a relatively small ship, a 20,000 ton 
cruiser.  But as you can see, it is vastly superior to any laser.

*Lasers top out at the levels described in SSDS&QSDS but Meson Guns 
*just keep getting bigger and badder.  Have faith.  I am hoping that the 
*upcoming supplements devoted to spacecraft will answer all these 
*questions in more detail.

While the costs for the ship are the same per week.  They are higher for a 
ship that can do jump 2 than ther are for a ship that does only Jump 1. 
 The income is the same or less (less space inside devoted to income 
generation)

A jump 1 ship is very difficult to pay off.  A jump 2 ship is even harder.

If income is related to distance then Jump 2  and above can be cost 
effective but this effectiveness decreases if they start to make two many 
jumps at lower jump numbers.

    'body' => 'I agree with both of the postings I have read - mostly. Yes, the
Imperial Army probably does have a great deal of irregular units (like
the Army Reserve in the U.S.). This is also not the best way to have
effective front-line units. I have a roughly sketched out hierarchy of
ground units for my campaign and a \'rationale\' behind it.
  The Imperial Army is a true standing army - manned by full-time,
professional soldiers and officers from all over the Empire (and beyond)
who train constantly. These are primarily front-line combat units
(ground assault, jump troops, heavy infantry, mechanized infantry,
tanks). Units will, in general, have high morale; they are elite units
who work, train, and play together. They will have the best equipment
and it will be well maintained. Primary support units (intelligence,
supply, maintenance, medical) will also be Imperial Army (IA) - but
there won\'t be enough of these units to support a major ground campaign
for more than a day or two.
  The Imperial Army Reserve (IAR) consists of \'part-time\' soldiers who
received the general training of IA soldiers but are primarily
civilians. Their officers and NCO\'s receive further training and are
often IA soldiers who did not retire. In return for regularly scheduled
training, these soldiers receive small monthly stipends. The IAR has
mainly support units that are \'called up\' to help support the IA; since
they are not front-line units and are often using the same skills they
use as civilians they are quite effective. Some combat units (primarily
tank and mechanized units - because of the cost of full-time use of the
vehicles)are in the IAR - they are \'mixed-in\' with IA units in combat
(i.e., a tank battalion will have 3 IA companies and 1 IAR company). The
IAR will be much less homogenous than the IA since its unit members
almost always live on the same planet.
  The Colonial Army (ICA) is made up of the various ground units of
member planets who choose to follow IA requirements. The units vary from
highly-trained, experienced brigades of well-equipped soldiers to small
companies of personal guards for a Marquis. Like the IAR the soldiers of
a particular ICA unit will usually all be from the same planet, perhaps
the same city! These are virtually all combat units and training and
morale vary greatly. The IA guidelines require that they get training in
working with IA units and have IA standard small arms and vehicles (if
any). While some planets with ICA units have reserve combat and support
units, they are not considered seperately from the regular ICA forces.
  Because of the nature of ICA units, they are heavily trained in
planetary defense (thus the standard weapons and training - easier to
resupply them quickly from IA depots and reinforce them with IA units).
During extended ground wars they would likely become a source of trained
replacements for combat losses.
  
 This also allows the Imperium to \'blanket\' an area with ground units.
In a given sector their may be an IA Legion (and its IA support units)
at the sector capitol and in a particulary strategic subsector. Each
subsector capitol would likely have 2-3 IA brigades with IA support
units. 3-5 (or more) planets in each subsector would have IAR units and
depots while many other planets would have ICA units. 
 
 Lets say a Vargr army attacks an outlying world with ICA units. The ICA
would \'dig-in\' and mount a defense. As the word spreads through the
subsector, IAR units mobilize. Within 1 day of receiving word (probably
less) the nearest IAR units could begin sending weapons, ammo, and
medical supplies to the ICA. The IA brigades at the subsector capitol
could immediately move to the area and find IAR support units and
supplies waiting for them, if not on the attacked planet, then nearby.
By the time the sector capitol hears of the invasion IAR units and
depots would be shipping soldiers, vehicles, and supplies to the front
line and several IA brigades would be on-planet or nearby, preparing for
counter-attack.

  While long-winded, I think this shows how a relatively small force of
full-time soldiers and irregular support units could effectively defend
a large area of space.

Sorry, Garry, back to hornet-stirring duty for you.  Your proposed
definition of zero longitude fails because the substellar point at
peri/apastron *changes* (radically) from year to year, unless the
planet\'s year is an even multiple of the rotation period -- which, for
practical purposes, only happens in tidal-lock cases.

This one is a quickie, though.

I\'ve been looking for a general rule to place TAS facilities.  I seem 
to recall that I read, somewhere in the past, that TAS facilities are 
only located next to class C or better starports.

Is this correct?  Or, are TAS facilities just about everywhere, or 
what?

Rupert, read what I\'m saying before you reply.  I was not comparing a 
Jump-1 ship to a Jump-2 ship.

Just like I said in the quote you took from my post, I was comparing 
the cost that a JUMP-2 ship would have if it jumped 2 parsecs vs 
 THE SAME SHIP jumping 1 parsec.  The costs are the same--no matter 
how far the ship jumps.

Fuel for the jump will be the same--no matter if the ship jumps one 
parsec or two.

And, that\'s what my argument was.  Sure, there are some cost 
differences between a Jump-1 ship and a Jump-3 ship, but the 
operating cost for the Jump-3 ship is the same no matter what the 
distance travelled.

That was my whole point.

Kenneth.

<nudge, nudge> heh heh -- yeah.

Seriously, though, the feedback I\'ve gotten on the Sayat has mostly been
"how\'d they survive with no technology after being left on the planet?"  My
thinking was that \'in the beginning...\' they did have a fair degree of
technological advancement -- say, TL-2 or so -- whether this was left over
from a failed Rule of Man colonization effort, thoughtfully provided by
Hiver experimenters, or preserved from Grandfather\'s day.

This raises a more general question, though:  what sort of societies did
the Ancients permit/provide to their various exported human populations?
Were they all kept in a state of barbarism, nasty, brutish, and short; or
kept as house pets/servants/laborers, bred for docility and obedience, or
what?  Anyone have any thoughts or ideas on this?

We\'d better come up with some pithy sayings about not playing with your

?!  The anatomy you\'re suggesting sounds a *lot* farther removed from our
own human biology than that of the Sayat as-drafted.  The only reproductive
tweak I\'ve proposed is ovum-ovum fertilization.  The slight decrease in the
gestation period is purely for tidiness/fun, so it\'s roughly equal to 60
local days.  I prefer the parsimonious side, until a really strong
counter-argument (or more entertaining idea) comes up.

Well, that assumes a genetic engineering team that happens to share late
20th century Euro-American ideas of efficacy, efficiency, and aesthetics.
<Yawn>, IMHO.  There\'s plenty of that out there already.  One mad
scientist\'s jerry-rig is another mad scientist\'s dream machine.

I\'m trying to make this a non-munchkin design, too.  Who says the designers
were competent?  It\'s entirely possible that the geneering was done by a
bunch of stranded colonists for who knows *what* reason (religious mania?),
or by some wandering Hiver who didn\'t really know squat about human
biology, or by some surviving minion of the Elder God -- er, Grandfather
<G> -- suffering from brain-freeze, or something far worse, for all we
know.  Remember the Roanoke colony, anyone? <G>  I=E4 Cthulhu!

Also, if a Sayat group doesn\'t have the ability to produce a \'baster in the
course of a decade or so (a pretty reasonable period of time, given the
lifespan), it\'s unlikely they\'d be able to survive single winter -- or even
a single night -- on their home planet.  It\'s dang cold, and the food
doesn\'t grow on trees.

Lastly -- the Sayat should be perfectly capable of being total dickheads
without actually possessing dicks.  Wait \'till you read the culture sketch
I\'m working on...  evangelical communist UFO-kook conspiracy theorists.

Positing an ovis sounds illegal, frankly... and the Sayat don\'t have sheep
anyway; only tweaked reindeer-like things. <G>

*********************************

Sayat social structure and social philosophy are uncannily similar to Hiver
patterns, giving rise to the theory (and widespread popular belief) that
they are the product of a large-scale Hiver "manipulation."

STRUCTURE:
Like the Hiver, individuals live in \'nests\' sharing a broad focus of
economic activity or interest (usually), and in which wealth and belongings
are owned communally.  The nest is the basic unit of society, rather than
the family (nuclear or otherwise).  It is true that in some respects the
nest is similar to the extended family in other human societies, and it is
likely that in earlier times, the \'nest\' bore more resemblence to a \'clan,\'
with its emphasis on consanguity and shared descent.

Most nests are part of larger \'hives,\' the rough equivalents of cities,
corporations, or nations.  Governmental structures (both civilian and
military) are also considered nests and hives, and are not particularly
distinguished from other specialized units.

Mobility among nests (and to a slightly lesser extent, hives) is quite high
in the modern era.  Most Sayat change their nest affiliation after reaching
maturity and having finished the mandatory stint of \'national service;\'
many go on to switch affiliation several times in the course of their life.
Individuals may also live and work separately from their primary nest
affiliation for extended periods of time.

While there are some who shift from nest to nest, sometimes even having
concurrent membership in several, there are no Sayat who are \'nestless\'.
Occasionally someone will claim to be without a nest affiliation; other
Sayat, however, will not recognize this claim, and go on treating such an
individual (who is probably mentally ill) as a member of the appropriate
nest and hive.  The nest-hive structure of society is so fundamental to
Sayat culture that someone who is not part of it is, almost by definition,
not Sayat -- and possibly a menace to the common good.

GOVERNMENT:
This is best described as a \'civil service bureaucracy\'.  There is a single
large hive which can be called \'the Government,\' which fulfills all the
functions of the \'state\' in other human societies, as well as playing many
additional roles.  The \'Government Hive\' is made up of a large number of
smaller, specialized nests, each one focused on a particular aspect or
function of managing society and furthering the advance of civilization.
This hive acts as the chief mechanism for redistributing capital within the
economy; it "taxes" other hives and after using this wealth to support its
own activities, "invests" or "subsidizes" those of others.  Large amounts
of public work is handled by "subcontracting" in this manner, and the line
between "public" and "private" endeavours is often so blurry as to be not
worth examining.

Forcing Sayat political systems into our own molds, one can view this hive
as the executive branch of government; it also has a great deal of what we
might call legislative and judicial authority.  However, the legislative
branch is supplemented by frequent recourse to public debate and referenda
- -- and given the indistinctness of the public versus private spheres,
legislation is highly sensitive to the groundswell or undercurrent of
popular opinion.

The judicial powers and duties of the state work in tandem with the
\'judges\' or \'mediators\' -- private individuals who, based on their
expertise in law and rhetoric, can be called in (or may independently
intercede) to settle conflict between individuals or groups in society.
While these \'judges\' are entirely separate from the governmental structure
proper, and do not form specialized \'judicial nests\' of their own, they
maintain fairly tight professional links with one another, and can be
considered a sort of parallel political agency, largely free of state
oversight.

ECONOMY AND BUSINESS:
The modern Sayat economy grew out of a communal, redistributive economy,
where the fundamental socioeconomic unit was the \'proto-nest\' or (putative)
\'clan.\'  Claims to territory (grazing circuits, hunting territories,
fishing grounds) and the ownership of livestock and enclosures were all
held by the community as a whole, rather than individuals or families.
With technological advances and the  development of a global culture, the
precursors of the \'hive\' arose to coordinate the more complex interactions,
and something best described as a \'command economy\' resulted.  Sayat
economic thought has only vague, crude ideas of a \'free market\', though
recent contact with other civilizations is slowly beginning to produce
changes in the way they see their economy.

Property and capital is still owned communally, by the nests and hives.
While individual Sayat do have personal belongings and limited amounts of
wealth, their daily needs (food, housing, clothing, transportation, medical
care, power, communications, etc.) are all furnished by the collective.
Long-term projects and investments are undertaken entirely by groups, and
not by individuals.  Individuals who are in some way \'over-achievers,\' who
are a particular asset to their collective, do get many perks (prime
housing, use of personal vehicles, servants, access to a bigger \'credit
line\' and more \'pocket money,\' etc.) but have no more inalienable, personal
property than anyone else.  Those on the opposite end of the truncated
Sayat social ladder will get stuck with less desireable housing and find
their hive or nest somewhat less willing to pay for their luxuries.

The Sayat were slow in developing a monetary economy; it arose entirely out
of the need to coordinate the activities of independent, hive-sized
collectives in the early modern period.  Even today, within a large hive
there is very little exchange carried out with money (either cash or
electronic); most is done by a complicated system of barter and contract,
if need for accounting is perceived at all.  Much is done essentially
gratis, \'for the common good.\'  Within nests, what few transactions take
place are entirely non-monetary.

Various nests and hives are heavily involved in specific industries or
economic activities.  Through de facto monopolies and de jure agreements
with the state, many have quasi-governmental authority in their fields of
interest.  Any enterprise that is necessary to a significant part of the
population, or is important to them, is certain to be run as a \'public
utility\' through some combination of direct governmental control and
\'subcontracted\' responsibility.  Again, the public-private distinction is
fuzzy; the Sayat are not familiar with the concept, in any case.

CHILD-REARING is one aspect of society that differs from the Hiver model,
obviously.  While the Sayat are highly K-selected (even more than most
human subspecies), the Hiver are completely the opposite.

Each Sayat nest has a communal nursery and school in which all children
live, are raised, and are educated.  Professional caretakers and teachers
do most of the work, but the nest as a whole is constantly and deeply
involved in the child-rearing process -- a Hiver-like "parental instinct"
has largely replaced the human "reproductive instinct."  The parent-child
bond is very weak; it is considered a sign of neurosis (at least) for
parents to be possessive or even partial towards their "own" children --
and, vice versa, for children to fixate on their mothers.  Rather, adults
exhibit a generalized pride and possessive attitude towards the sum of the
children of their nest and hive.

In larger hives, the component nests often do not maintain their own
nurseries, but there are commonly-shared nurseries for the use of all nests
in a given district or neighborhood.  In modern times, the government has
stepped in to regulate child care and education, so as to ensure
standardization of the culture and knowledge imparted.

Infants are not considered "pests" as among the Hiver, but the Sayat do
lack much of the sentimentality of most other human societies toward
children and childhood.  For example, in dire emergencies where only some
portion of a group can be saved, the Sayat will gladly sacrifice children
- -- the youngest ones first -- while concentrating on rescuing adults and
the elderly.  The Sayat consider that less has been \'invested\' in the
young, and being easier to replace than their elders, they are more
disposable.

SEX:  This one I leave to the readers\' surely fertile imaginations.
"Unusually long fingers" and "mechanical assistance" has already been
introduced; \'muff said.  A couple general thoughts, though.

Due to Sayat biology, there\'s no connection between having sex and having
babies.  The first is a matter of entertainment and social bonding with
other adult individuals; the latter, of bonding to your nest, of
contributing to posterity.

Sayat feel strongly that children belong with other children, under the
supervision and care of the nest\'s nursery/school system, so childbearing
and rearing is far less of a burden on individual parents than in most
other human societies.

Pair-bonding does occur among Sayat, but such \'mated\' individuals are not
especially likely to have children with one another (rather than with
anyone else), nor are they expected to; even sexual activity is not a
given, for that matter.  There are innumerable other forms of \'personal
relationships\'; it is hard to make any generalizations on the matter, for
the reason that the Sayat simply don\'t attach much importance to such
matters.  The key emotional bond for a Sayat is with her nest (and by
extension her hive); colleagues, friends, coworkers,  and lovers are not
the less important, but viewed as more transitory, casual, and open to
consideratiosn of expediency.

CULTURAL POLICY:
Like the Hiver, they seek to ensure linguistic and cultural homogeneity: a
broad, fundamental body of shared assumptions, knowledge, and attitudes.
The Sayat regard this as the only possible basis for individuality and
personal freedom -- it provides a common ground for communication,
throughout all of Sayat society, without distinctions of region, social
status, economic power, or the like.  To this end, travel and mass
communication are widely encouraged and subsidized by Sayat hives and
nests, particularly the governmental ones.  Something very similar to Hiver
"embassies" are found in the form of exchanges, delegations, conferences,
tour groups and the like; the emphasis on exchanging genetic material is
much muted and less conscious, though not entirely absent.

EDUCATION:
The Sayat place an enormous amount of importance on education.  The
\'nurseries\' bear more resemblance to boarding schools; formal teaching
begins at age four, and children are not released from the custodianship of
the nursery until their fifteenth year.  For historical reasons, the Sayat
are fairly militaristic, and two years of (ground) military training is
mandatory at this point, followed by another two years of service in the
ground forces, further training in the space forces, or work and education
in some field of \'social importance\' -- medicine, disaster readiness,
construction, law enforcement, agriculture and ranching, ditch-digging, or
anything else.  Advanced education is then an option which many Sayat take.
Many continue involvement in formal educational programs for decades, as
continuing or returning students.

Numerous specialized schools, institutes, academies, and research centers
exist, again set up on the nest-hive model.  At the post-secondary level,
there is generally little formal distinction between "research" and
"teaching;" much of the work at such institutions involves mentoring
arrangements, somewhat similar to apprenticeships.  The casual student will
keep her own nest/hive affiliation while attending, and the dedicated
scholar will join the nest/hive as a new member.

PSIONICS:
Despite the prevalence of superstition in the culture, psionics have never
been considered as anything other than phenomena subject to rational,
scientific investigation and application.  While psionics do not determine
social status as among the Zhodani (or even Vlazhdumecta), psionic testing
is given to all children, and those who have such talents are given the
necessary training and education to develop and use it.  They then go on to
take up roles in society where their talents will be of use -- psychology,
investigation, hazardous materials handling, search and rescue, etc.  There
is no particular fear or reverence shown to psionics in society.  The
number of psionically-talented individuals is perhaps slightly higher than
among "normal" human populations, but not greatly so, and this may be a
function of careful testing being able to catch a greater number of natural
talents.

DEMOGRAPHICS:
Like the Hiver, Sayat prefer to live in large, compact urban complexes.
Single-building city-arcologies are unknown, but urban buildings do tend to
be enormous and multi-use.  The distribution of population among the cities
is fairly even; there is no clear "megapolis" or "main city" on the planet.


Six large cities (with populations between 20 and 60 million) are present
on the surface of Marhach; an additional 35-40 smaller cities, each with
several million inhabitants, are scattered around the planet.  There are
relatively few small cities and towns; less than 9% of the planet\'s
population lives in such settlements.

However, it is customary to maintain rural cottages, resort villages,
camps, dachas, spas, and the like, either individually or as a group; one\'s
time is often split between "city" and "country" in this way, depending on
the season, work necessities, and personal preference.  For all but a
handful of modern Sayat, one\'s primary affiliation is considered to be with
the city, rather than the country.

Although farming and ranching are considerably more land-extensive than
among the Hiver, there are still large expanses of "wilderness" territory
on the planet.  Small numbers of Sayat continue to live the traditional,
nomadic pastoralist lifestyle.  In all, no more than 1% of the planetary
population can be considered rural.

If you have a higher Jump ship you can reach more different planets &
you can therefore find a planet which will be a _better_ market for the
cargo you are selling.

As an an example let us suppose you are on the planet Regina/Spinward
Marches & you wish to move some cargo.  I have listed all planets
reachable including interdicted ones.

A Jump 1 trader can reach 3 planets
(Jenghe, Ruie, Hefry)

A Jump 2 trader can reach 10 planets
(Jenghe, Ruie, Hefry, Extolay, Dinom, Dinomn, Wypoc, Djinni, Yori,
Forboldn)

A Jump 3 trader can reach 14 planets 
(Jenghe, Ruie, Hefry, Extolay, Dinom, Dinomn, Wypoc, Djinni, Yori,
Forboldn, Phlume, Rech, Roup, Knorbes)

A Jump 4 trader can reach 23 planets
(Jenghe, Ruie, Hefry, Extolay, Dinom, Dinomn, Wypoc, Djinni, Yori,
Forboldn, Phlume, Rech, Roup, Knorbes, KKirka, Treece, Yurst, Algine,
Woochiers, Whanga, Grant, 871-438, Tionale)

A Jump 5 trader can reach 32 planets
(Jenghe, Ruie, Hefry, Extolay, Dinom, Dinomn, Wypoc, Djinni, Yori,
Forboldn, Phlume, Rech, Roup, Knorbes, KKirka, Treece, Yurst, Algine,
Woochiers, Whanga, Grant, 871-438, Tionale, Echiste, Keanou, Inthe,
Rethe, Pscias, Feri, Uakye, Alell, Rangent)

A Jump 6 trader can reach 46 planets
(Jenghe, Ruie, Hefry, Extolay, Dinom, Dinomn, Wypoc, Djinni, Yori,
Forboldn, Phlume, Rech, Roup, Knorbes, KKirka, Treece, Yurst, Algine,
Woochiers, Whanga, Grant, 871-438, Tionale, Echiste, Keanou, Inthe,
Rethe, Pscias, Feri, Uakye, Alell, Rangent, Denotam, Ghandi, Ylaven,
Pirema, Kinorb, Dhian, Paya, Moughas, Shionthy, Enope, Boughene, Efate,
Lysen, Tremous Dex)




Assuming that the surrounding region is all of average density (half the
hexes have systems) ships can statistically expect to be able to reach
the following number of planets

Jump 1		3 planets
Jump 2		9 planets
Jump 3		18 planets
Jump 4		30 planets
Jump 5 		45 planets
Jump 6		63 planets

The more places you can go to to sell your cargo the better a market for
it you can choose to travel to and the more money you can make on it. 
This is why the megacorporations concentrate on the high jump ships as
they can sell to the best markets this way.

Note that for passengers and freight this you cannot make more money by
selling what you are carying for more money as the prices for freight &
passengers are fixed. However you can choose to go to planets more
people & freight wish to go to thereby ensuring your ship is fuller &
making more money (or at least loosing less) than you would otherwise.

Since the Megacorporations can afford the higher capital investments
needed for the higher jump trades they will have a comparative advantage
in doing so.

Yes but at least one of these changes was a very large one.

T4 has changed jump fuel requirements back to CT\'s 10% of hull volume
per jump number from the smaller voulumes required by MT and TNE.
Many perfectly good ship designs, including most of my favorites, were
totally invalidated by this change.

In Mt and TNE\'s Fire Fusion & Steel the ammount of jump fuel required
was 5 times the size of the drives for the maximum possible jump and not
10% of the hull volume per jump number.

Jump 1 drives 	2 % of hull vol		jump 1 fuel	10% of hull vol

Jump 2 drives	3 % of hull vol		jump 1 fuel	7.5% of hull vol
					jump 2 fuel	15% of hull vol

Jump 3 drives	4% of hull vol		jump 1 fuel	6.67% of hull 
					jump 2 fuel	13.33 % of hull
					jump 3 fuel	20% of hull vol

Jump 4 drives	5% of hull vol		jump 1 fuel	6.25% of hull
					jump 2 fuel	12.5% of hull
					jump 3 fuel	18.75% of hull
					jump 4 fuel	25% of hull vol

Jump 5 drives	6% of hull vol		jump 1 fuel	6% of hull vol
					jump 2 fuel 	12% of hull vol
					jump 3 fuel	18% of hull vol
					jump 4 fuel	24% of hull vol
					jump 5 fuel	30% of hull vol

Jump 6 drives	7% of hull vol		jump 1 fuel	5.83% of hull
					jump 2 fuel	11.67% of hull
					jump 3 fuel	17.5% of hull
					jump 4 fuel	23.33% of hull
					jump 5 fuel	29.17% of hull
					jump 6 fuel	35% of hull vol

Under the old system a more powerfull (higher jump number) jump drive
was more efficient & this made sense to me.  Under the new system you
donot have this advantage anymore.

A ship designed with FF&S could be translated & adapted into a MT
design  or vice versa but niether one can be translated into a CT or T4
design if the ship in question was more than jump2 or so because its
fuel tank requirements are now so high that the ship no longer has room
for the fittings it used to have.

Not the best location for a get-together, true, but it\'s a great

That\'s ok. I can think of at least one possible ship carried weapon
that can\'t be used by planetary defense.

Any planet with an ionisphere has a *major* potential difference
between the surface and the ionisphere. It runs about 1000 volts per
meter on earth. The ionisphere and the surface thus form the plates of
a giant spherical capacitor.

Now, take a big tunable laser. Mount it on a ship. Use it to ionize a
path from the ionisphere to the ground. You get a "lightning bolt" with
a power level more suited to an asteroid impact.

It may be more of a "slow burn". Taking a few hours to drain the
charge. Either way it\'ll act like EMP only a *billion* times worse.
Electronics fry, long conductors melt, etc, etc. And your ship is
floating "serenely" above the devastation.

BTW, a "tamed" version of this makes a power plant that allows such
insanities as broadcast power. (a "solar tap")

Gravity waves can\'t be "transverse". They are more like sound waves.
Push this way, then the opposite way, but both pushes are along the
direction the wave is travelling rather than at right angles to it.

ps. The "solar tap" may make a better weapon for the invaders, but a
planet has sheer *size* on it\'s side. Picture a toroidal PAW wrapped
around the planet! This works nicely for those rich, small worlds with
no or trace atmospheres...

If you break the accelerator, they can use segments as mass drivers!

Not if the ship is paid up. Under the present rules a 40 year old paid up
ship is a _far_ better investment than a new ship, because the crippling
bank payments are missing. You can undercut the freight and passenger charges
of your competitors and still make a truly ridiculous amount of money.
The joker in the deal is, of course, breakdowns and repairs. A breakdown of
a jump drive can wipe out several years worth of profits in one fell swoop.
Only the rules don\'t deal with that.

That was one of the bits I intended to change. Bank payments amount to 6.25%
of the 80% the owner borrowed from the bank, and that is, as you point out,
not profit but cost of capital. But the owner also invested 20% of his own 
money and he\'ll expect a return on that. For simplicity\'s sake I decided to
make that return 6.25% too, and to say that 20% was the owner\'s profit and
the remaining 80% was the bank\'s profit. This is, as was pointed out to me,
not correct. First of all, the bank payments include paying off the principal,
so the true return for the bank is roughly 3%. Secondly, given that a bank
makes 3% on a not entirely risk-free venture like financing a starship, the
owner propably couldn\'t find alternate investments giving more than 3%, so
a 3% return on his 20% of the ship is propably more realistic. So when I
redo the figures I\'ll split the return into two parts.

Sure. But what I want to do is to determine the economic "environment" that
a Free Trader operates in, and that means the average. The special cases I
dismissed in the first paragraph, because you can mess things up pretty
much any way you want in the short run using special cases.

Well, preserved food is designed to last for months and is posssibly not as
palatable as fresh food (I say possibly, because although such is the case
today, I suspect that another 6 TLs will enhance food preservation
techniques considerably), so preserved luxury food may be more expensive
than Cr20 per day, but not by a factor 8.

But if refined fuel cost more than ~Cr250 it becomes more economic for even a 
small ship to install a fuel purifier, because the money saved on fuel will 
be more than the revenue lost from the lessened cargo/passenger capacity.

See above. Bank payments amount to 6.25% of the money borrowed from them.

Geonee Sourcebook. I\'ve been silent for a while, but, at last...
        This is the First Draft (comments very welcome) of a short summary
on the Llyrnians, a minor alien race two parsecs away from the boundaries of
the Second Geonee Confederation.
        After reading this, maybe you will understand all those nasty rumors
about imperial ships being boarded by bizarre demons who can see in the dark
and  beat the Imperial Marines, and follow the orders of dwarf-like

================================================================================
The Llyrnians

Homeworld (Milieu Zero) in Shokee subsector / Massilia:

Llyrn		0931	D333AAA-A		Na Po Hi	933	F8 VI

	Llyrn is a cold world, a satellite of a gas giant orbiting a small star.
It\'s upper crust is full of huge natural caves. Life appeared on these caves
around geothermal energy sources, and most of the native life forms are
subterranean, cave-bound or tunnel-dwellers.

Physiology

	The Llyrnians are based on a trilateral symmetry, with three "legs" on the
bottom part of a cylindrical "body" from which three "arms" spread. On the
upper part of the body, a "head" holds most of the sensorial organs,
basically three "ears", a visual band which circles the whole head, and
three breathing orifices which function as smelling "noses" and are able to
produce noises for communication. Three "mouths" open under the arms for
feeding purposes.
	Three vibrating membranes on the upper part of the body give them a "sonar"
capability.
	The Llyrnians are basically tunnel-dwellers (they dwell the tunnels
"upwards" using all three arms) whose main senses are hearing (which
includes sonar) and smelling. Their vision centers on the infrared part of
the spectrum.

	The Llyrnians biology is based on a triploid genetic system. They have
three sexes, usually referred to as "Warrior", "Dweller", and "Feeder".
Feeders give birth to one or two newborns (almost always of the same sex)
after a gestation period of 112 standard days.
	Genders are specialized. Warriors defend the community, Dwellers build the
tunnels and Feeders take care of the children.

	The average weight of a Llyrnian is 60 kilograms for Warriors and Dwellers
and 80 for Feeders. The average height is 1.5 meters for the three sexes.
        The UPP for Llyrnians is different for the three sexes.
Dwellers: Str = 2D-2, Dex = 2D+1, End = 2D, Int = 2D, Edu = 2D, Soc= 4+1D
Warriors: Str= 2D, Dex = 2D+1, End = 2D, Int = 2D-1, Edu = 2D-2, Soc= 2+1D
Feeders: Str= 2D-2, Dex = 2D-2, End= 6+1D, Int = 2D-2, Edu = 2D-2, Soc= 1D

Society and Culture

	The Llyrnian society is built upon the community, a group ranging between a
few hundreds and ten thousand individuals of the three sexes. The community
leader, always a dweller, has almost absolute powers. The members of the
community instinctively accept its authority.
	The measure of the power of a community is the extent of the tunnels and
caves it controls. So, dwellers are constantly planning new tunnels while
taking care of the stability of already settled ones, while warriors
perpetually try to capture those belonging to rival communities, while
defending the own settlements.
	The "tunnel fights" are ruthless battles fought in narrow, dark tunnels.
The Warriors rely heavily on their infrared vision and their sonar sense
during the fights.
	The planet has been ruled as a whole by a central authority as long as
historical records exist. This central government takes the form of a
Charismatic Dictatorship in the person of the Supreme Dweller, which is
designated by the previous one among the leaders of the most influential
communities. Succession takes place when the Supreme Dweller reaches an
advanced age.
	The Supreme Dweller does not usually interfere with the fights between the
communities, as long as they do not evolve into large-scale wars through
alliances and coalitions of communities.

History

	The Llyrnians were first contacted in year -9,070 by the neighboring Geonee
(a minor human race). Llyrn was then at TL 3, but the population had already
exceeded the one thousand figure.
	The Geonee contacted Llyrn sporadically and helped the Llyrnians to upgrade
their technology, introducing heavy machinery which allowed the dwellers to
build larger and deeper tunnels. Over the following centuries, the Dwellers
acquired more and more technical knowledge, and a demographic explosion
occurred.
	In -4,900, the Geonee were defeated by the Vilani and incorporated into the
Ziru Sirka. The Llyrnians, then at TL 7 in environment control and heavy
machinery, experienced a technological regression. Although they were
formally also incorporated into the Ziru Sirka, the few Vilani who ever
ventured into the tunnels never came back, and Llyrn was, for all practical
purposes, interdicted. Geonee historians speculate with the possibility that
some Geonee refugees spent their lives in Llyrn as technical advisors.
	In -2,235, the Nth war between the Solomani and the Vilani made the Geonee
revolt against the Vilani. During the war, thousands of Llyrnians were used
by the Geonee as starship troopers, thanks to an agreement with the Supreme
Dweller, in exchange for heavy machinery. The effectiveness of the Llyrnians
in boarding operations and infiltration operations was terrible. Low-G
adapted and relying in infrared vision and sonar, the Llyrnian Warriors
easily beat the humans in a fight on the corridors of a boarded starship,
when the light goes off and the artificial gravity fails. The Geonee were
able to capture hundreds of Vilani starships thanks to the Llyrnian troops.
	The Nth war started a tradition of using Llyrnian Warriors as Marines in
Geonee ships.
	In -2,200, the Rule of Man created the Geonee Autonomous Region, which
included the Geonee worlds and Llyrn. Llyrn reached TL 8 and a population of
dozens of thousands of millions.
	In -1,776, the Long Night started. Llyrn fell to TL5 in a few centuries,
but although most tunnels had to be abandoned when the environmental
controls failed, the planet managed to retain a population over ten thousand
of millions.
	In -177, Llyrn was recontacted by the recently founded Second Geonee
Confederation. Geonee technical advisors and heavy machinery were once again
exchanged for Llyrnian Warriors.
	A century later, the Geonee Confederation offered membership to Llyrn, but
the Supreme Dweller declined the offer. Nevertheless, in -81, a full
Confederation Embassy was established at Llyrn, and, in year -73, a detailed
commercial treaty was signed. Llyrn slowly became a Client State of the
Geonee Confederation.
	In Year Zero, Llyrn retains, from the commercial point of view, a heavy
dependence from the Geonee Confederation. At TL 10 and with a population in
excess of ninety thousand of millions, the planet is an excellent market for
machinery and agroproducts. On the other hand, Llyrnian Warriors can be
found not only in the Geonee service, but also working for other planets or
corporations. And not only as starship troopers, but also doing ground work
in Low Gravity worlds. Llyrnian Dwellers also work in several worlds with
underground environments, for example in Dreva, inside the Geonee Confederation.
	The commercial balance of Llyrn is only equilibrated thanks to the
long-term contracts of Warriors and Dwellers out of Llyrn, all of which have
to be negotiated through the Supreme Dweller or its representatives.

Almost the same, but not quite.

No, the fuel for the jump will be less on the 1-parsec jump. Jump
governors has been part of the Traveller background since _High Guard_
and are so cheap that they have been standard since then (and so cheap
that the cost is ignored). A jump-2 ship jumping 1 parsec would normally
only use fuel enough for a jump-1.

However, the fuel costs are comparatively minor (especially if you use
realistic prices).

TAS facilities are at class A and B starports only. I\'d also add

upcomming Psi Institutes, hmmm...one can only guess.  But untill then here 
is what I have come up with for Computer Empathy.

Computer Empathy --  The ability of the psion to sense the electronic 
pathways of a computer or electronic device.  Dificulty is 2.5d under normal 
situations.
Cost is as follows:
0 if machine is touched, 1Psi/Meter otherwise.
+1 Psi/Computer complexity rating
+1 for each additional computer to be accessed, for example if the info 
being searched for is on another computer in a LAN, +1.  If you need to 
access the local net +3.  If you need to cruise the internet +5.  Think of 
it as how many routers you need to jump by to reach your destination.

Success at the basic(2.5d) level allows the psion to passively scan all data 
within the computer or device.  This will alow the psion to know not only 
data in a machine, but if there are any broken lines in a computer system or 
device, the proper button sequence or radio frequency for activation of an 
item.  Very useful for repairing electronics or intrusion.

"It\'s all melty inside!" -- Anakin Solo, Ambush at Corellia.

What this will not do is allow manipulation of data, you still need a 
computer for that.  Nor will it alow decryption of data, the psion will see 
the data as a hacker would on a screen, bunch of indeciperable garbage.

Comments? Mind you, as always I\'m wearing my flame retardant Commanders 
Uniform! :)

Traveller has always assumed that one of the major technological
breakthroughs will be artificial gravity.

A starship has two forms of internal AG; the floor plates that provide a
comfortable living enviroment, and inertial compensators that counteract
the effects of high-g acceleration and manuevering.

If you accelerated a ship at a constant 1-g, you would have the sensation
of normal gravity along the axis of thrust.

Yes. I think I let my meson gun off half-cocked, so to speak.

Yes, as far as construction systems go, QSDS and SSDS are really
well done and certainly make FF&S a lot more palatable.

Yes!

I suppose I was griping a bit too much about the construction system
which really isn\'t what\'s broken - it\'s the combat system that\'s broken.
It would be nice if there was some easy patch that would allow everything
to make sense, but it doesn\'t look like there is.

If you built a 5000Mj laser, it would probably be better still,
but the TL*50 rule deals with that problem (though a 600Mj TL12
laser would still be pretty deadly).

Ah-ha! I\'ve never even seen TNE ship combat rules, so I did not
know this was the case. It certainly makes a lot more sense. No 
doubt it got thrown out for being to awkward or some other half-though-out
reason.

I still think that meson _screens_ are a bit out of whack: at TL 12,
you can still get a screen with a USP of 12, which seems pretty high.
Of course, since the combat system is broken, we have no idea how
to interpret that figure or what it means. :(

The current low ceiling on the kind of ships you can build
is a sticking point for sure. it\'s hard to build a realistic
military ship at those sizes, at least in terms of what a 
"realistic military ship" was in CT & MT.

At very short range, that a USP of 14, at short, a USP of 11.
Not bad. Of course, in T4, a battery of a mere 56 of those laser
turrets would do equal damage (ugh).

Thanks for clearing all of this up for me. My complaining about the
T4 space combat being broken is really old news to a lot of people I
suppose, but this is really the first time I\'ve sat down and had
a good, hard look at it.

Anyways, this still doesn\'t really resolve my initial problem,
which was how to figure out what\'s an acceptable set of
armaments for a merchant ship to be able to "reasonably defend" itself.
THUDDD judges are just going to have to go on their gut feeling
as to what\'s an acceptable number of lasers, sandcasters, dampers
and (ugh) meson screens.

And my apologies to any TNE fans for griping. The things broken in
T4 aren\'t broken because they inherited them from TNE.

Going to a low simmer,
Ethan

I\'ve always assumed that total cost of ownership is included in that
price.  Filters (gas and fluid), consumables (toilet paper, cleaning
supplies, lubricants, etc) for the ship, miscellaneous spare parts (shower
nozzle, toilet seat, computer i/o device, etc), not to mention the
hundreds of parts that are needed on a regular basis for shipboard life.

It\'s not perfect, but it beats having to design a system, then maintain it
to simulate these costs.

> >JUMP FUEL

[snip]

Yes, there is a great deal of profit to be made, but look at the costs and
the risks.  H2, is very explosive when mixed with O2.  Handling it
requires training and could easily be construed as a high risk occupation
(read that as \'high paying\').  

Basically, there will be two types of companies in the business.  One type 
will have purification and tankage facilities and will be able to
provide H2 from stock onhand.  This is the type of facility I see
available at Class A, B, and most C starports.  The other type of company
will likely be little more than a pumping and purification plant,
providing fuel ondemand.  I tend to see this type of setup at D and
possibley E starports, and some of the sleazier C starports.

I really liked the Traveller computer games as well, but I\'ve got to 
admit, I didn\'t think #2 was better than #1.

The plot was cool, and the interface was better designed, but I got 
so board going to the same planet all the time.

I mean, each planet looked the same.  Every once in a while, they 
would move a building or something, but that was so damn boring.

What I really liked about game #1 was that, with each new place you 
went, you could discover all sorts of things that you had never seen 
before.  It was like going to a new place.

And, the places looked different.  You had to search around for a 
particular building--they weren\'t always in the same place all the 
time like in game #2.

Sure, the graphics in game #1 are old--especially by today\'s 
standards, but I got tons more enjoyment out of that game than I did 
the second one.

The first game felt more like Traveller.  The second one felt like an 
repetitious arcade game.

Before artificial gravity shows up at TL 9 and inertial compensators at TL
10, you have whatever acceleration your engines produce.  Once you get AG
at TL9, you can have a 1G floor field even if the engines are off, but the
gravity can never be less than the drives are currently producing.  Once
you get inertial compensators, then your gravity can be anything up to the
rating of the compensators.  If memory serves, they improve at 1G per TL,
and can compensate 6G at tech 15, 3G at TL 12, and 1G at TL 10.  Note that
they can also compensate for any rotational motion that the computer
running it knows about.  (For example, a laser hit that jerks the ship gets
through, but a sudden turn cannot be detected inside.)

These are memories from SOM, so I may have a few details wrong, but this is
how I have played it for some years.

Note: Sylean ships will often be designed with 5G drives, as the
compensators will eat three of them, and grav tanks let you ignore one
more.  If your players like to suffer, you can put a 6G drive on, which I
did to them recently when they had a high priority mission across the
system.

Now, you are making me want to dig through my old materials and look 
this up.

Wasn\'t the official rule that the amount of fuel it takes to initiate 
a jump the same--no matter what actual jump a ship was making?

I seem to remember an old Digest article that talked about this.  I 
think the point in the ariticle was that, no matter the actual jump 
attempted, the same procedure of ripping a hole into jumpspace, 
creating a jump field bubble, and closing the hole took the same 
amount of energy.

In the same article (I think), this was the reasoning behind 
microjump taking the same amount of fuel as a regular jump did.

I guess I should go look up this stuff before I get in over my 
head, but I\'m pretty sure that fuel consumption is the same (unless 
you are using home grown rules) no matter the distance travelled.

Most traveller ships beyond TL-9 or so have internal artificial gravity,
as well as G-compensation. So the internal gravity of the ship can be
varied. In fact, on many (if not all) ships, this is controllable on a
room-to-room basis. In TNE this was utilized by Virus (and in T4 by
Roderick\'s gang of hellions !)to play Grav Pong to some unfortunates.
Quickly turn the field on and of, inverting and turning it sideways as you
go. Get down a cooridor where the garvity is changing from 0-2 or 3 G
every second or so, and \'Down\' is changing too...NOT in synch. Soon you\'re
a little broken bag o bones somewhere at the end of a corridor.

Hm, the airport is a lousy location for an informal get-together.
I was thinking of more downtown-ish. Anyways, since there\'s a 
convention in town, maybe that\'s a good weekend to schedule something,
since more people might be in town, but if they\'re all at the airport,
maybe it\'s not. (Decisive, huh?)

The 15th is Father\'s day, so that might not be such a good day for
everyone. The 14th? Feedback?

I\'m at work now (and, therefore, don\'t have my Traveller stuff
with me) but I think it\'s in the definitions for starports. It may
also be in the world design rules.

I use MT though, so your mileage may vary.

I just figured that the TAS wouldn\'t bother putting up facilities
on a class A starport with, say, five people on the world.

I think the effectiveness of this would be mitigated by the lack of
current carrying capacity of the ionosphere and the parts of the
atmosphere below that...it IS pretty thin, after
all. That\'s why the charge builds up. Otherwise any asteroid that made it
through to the lower atmosphere, or hit the ground would cause such a
lightning blast. For that matter, so would the Space Shuttle on re-entry.

You might get a really impressive upper atmosphere lightning display, or a
nifty aurora effect. This could interrupt radio commo pretty well, so it\'s
useful for jamming, but as a weapon it\'d be useless.

NASA played with this last year with a power generating satellite that
exploited this effect. The experiment was a partial success, the cable
snapped \'cause it got fried by the current, IIRC.

You\'re referring to The Fifth Element, which I saw Wednesday. It\'s
a good B movie. Lots of grav vehicles, a couple of starships. The 
plot is pretty hokey but if you don\'t take it too seriously you\'ll
enjoy it. It\'s MUCH better than Hudson Hawk.

Some parts, especially the grav vehicle chase, remind me so much
of some of the Traveller campaigns I\'ve run.

Unless you put the grav plates in the walls and ceiling too, in which
case you can have zero G when the drives are cranked up full tilt. You
do this by simply turning on the grav plates that project in a 
direction equal to the direction of thrust, in this case the forward
walls.

Well, a laser wouldn\'t jerk the ship unless it caused an explosion.
If a missile or other object hit the ship, the inertial compensators
could handle it. I rule that, unless surprised, the sensors on the
ship can see the incoming missile and the inertial compensator program
will be ready for it.

Explosions are, naturally, another matter.

[details deleted]

However, it is still true that among _shipping_ companies, it
the jump routes that the large corps will dominate.  The large
corps in Traveller are presented as _shipping_ cargo and passengers.

Now one response might be to attempt to rewrite the background
so that virtually all trade goes by speculative trade and
the magacorps are _trading_ companies instead.  However,
then one would have to answer why cargo prices don\'t drop
or why anyone would want to try and fix them.

Arameth Gridlore has spent a lifetime exploring the vast reaches of space.
Now, his experience and wisdom are available to you in Gridlore Technologies _Terrapin_ class Merchant Cruiser.

Designed to travel in the deepest reaches of uncharted space, the Terrapin offers a wide variety of features for the adventurous merchant:

Large cargo capacity, over a third of the hull is dedicated hold space!

Long range with a state of the art Jump 3 drive installed.

On-board shops and labs to keep you in business far from the nearest advanced world

Berthing for a full squad of security; now you can feel truly safe when making those important first overtures.

A defensive suite that includes protection from everything up to meson weapons!  If you do have to fight it out, the Terrapin comes with four batteries of powerful lasers, more than enough to discourage even the most foolhardy attacker.

The Terrapin is equipped with strong sensors, and comes with electronic warfare gear to help you avoid costly engagements in the first place.

A word about cost... some designers will make do with cute-rate "modules", and claim that they are giving you a bargain.  But when you are 50pc. from the nearest help, do you want a bargain, or a ship designed to the highest tolerances?  That\'s the choice here.

Design Notes:

This is my first attempt at a THUDD.. comments are very welcome.

I have tried to balance merchant and exploratory missions with the Terrapin, and feel that it works well in both roles.  The fairly large cargo capacity, along with the passenger compliment, means that the ship is profitable; while the strong sensors and on-board labs make the ship a reasonable scout cruiser.

This design used the excellent spreadsheet "ss-v2.xls"  I can\'t remember where I found it, but my hat is off to the author, this is very easy to use.

My only real stumbling block was in the weaponry:  I found the instructions for converting to T4 confusing.  The Terrapin uses four batteries of 3 95Mj lasers.. I\'m not sure if this works out to:

2-0-0-0  or 4-3-2-0  (the lasers have a ROF of 100)

Hope you enjoy!

I especially like the STAFF projectile; 120mm tank round capable of top
attack on enemy vehicles hidden behind hills and such (assuming you know
about where they are).

Check the web.  The advantage we have is that if a "real world" source
talks about "possible future avenues of research" we can run away with it.

Likewise not a Physics Person; I would not worry too much about magnetics.
Just consider input energy, efficiency, and output velocity.  The formulas
for kinetic energy to electric energy are realatively simmple and you then
arbitrarily adjust your efficiency to fit your "canon" models below.  Just
be sure not to make the Mass Driver any more efficient than small arms
gauss rifles (or explain it if you do..."economies of scale" come to
mind).

Is there a reason (besides overkill) that ETC and MD technology can\'t be
used in the same weapon?

There will be a period of overlap where the two are equally useful; CPR
guns have advantages in smaller power requirements, MDs in less complex
mechanisms (maybe) and projectile safety (no explosive propellant, more
usable shell weight).

(I can\'t figure out what FE is - maybe you mean KE?)  I can see large
caliber MDs used for forward deployed mines, rounds with lots of
submunitions, rocket assisted rounds for long range use, and really big
bunker busters and such.  As you say, though, direct fire rounds will
probably be Discarding Sabot long-rod-penetrator (KE or KEAP or...well
pick your acronym) high velocity rounds.

I also think the above web site reflects the likelyhood of a large number
of guided indirect fire anti-armor weapons being used on future
battlefields. The ability to use self-forging projectiles (SEFOP) or
SADARM (seek and destroy armor) brings artillery back to the battlefield
with a vengance (not that it ever left).  Generally these seem to be
deployed in the form of submunitions, and the bigger the projectile, the
more submunitions of larger size you can deploy.

Can you say 380mm mass driver?  I thought you could.

Say vehicle mounts with fusion power plants.

This is kind of unclear; Penetration won\'t go down.  Are you trying to say
that it will have to level off in its increase relative to tech level?  I
have a feeling that, once MD tech is mature (at TL 10 say) the velocity
will level off at terminal for atmosphere (kind of like ship in water
velocity has reached a mature max)

Of course, materials technology or explosive technology can add power to
the projectile or increase hardness so that Kinetic Energy is eihter
supplemented or more efficiently transmitted to the target.  The advances
can affect ETC tech in the same way though.

I agree that plasma and afusion weapons should be better than MD *at their
short range* when they are introduced, but perhaps Plasma weapons diffuse
more rapidly, and MDs and ETC weapons are used for indirect fire and/or
point defense up to quite high TLs.  

Whew ,good subject.

Only if you assume that the trade rules are written for the megacorps.  I\'ve
always assumed that the reason high-jump routes weren\'t profitable for tramp
traders is that the megacorps had sewn up all the lucrative cargos, leaving
very little for the tramps.  The rules support this, if you assume that the
rules are intended for the tramp traders.

If one of my players got rich enough to take on a megacorp, I would leave the
existing rules behind and start a free-form game involving a lot of corporate
intrigue.

Think of it as the difference between running a colony (using World Tamer
rules) and running a high-pop planet.  You need to use different rules,
because the situations (and scales) are different.

Is some neat new (or retro?) rule? In MT and TNE if a L-2 ship travel 1
parsec it only uses half the fuel it needs for a J-2. That is what I was
basing my argument on, so if this no longer applies, then I\'m wrong. If it

I rather liked the effect of the MT/TNE jump system, because it means in a
really tight design you can spend more cash to put in a bigger, more
efficient drive and end up with a slightly smaller volume devoted to the
jump drive + fuel.

Starwerx Orbital Foundryworks is proud to present it\'s first entry in
the latest ISBA competition, the Nuphraitelle.  A medium sized,
streamlind wedge hull, the Nuphraitelle is outfitted with a 2 parsec
jump-drive and fuel for 4 parsec\'s travel--2 in standard tankage and 2
in a collapsable fuel bladders stowed in the middle cargo bay.

The philosophy with the Nuphraitelle is Opportunity, Capability,
Survival.

The Nuphraitelle\'s main sensor array, a Cassini Mk72 Survey package, is
the standard among medium-sized Imperial Interstellar Scout Service
vessels and gives the capability to survey uncharted or undercharted
star systems.  The onboard laboratory lets the crew support a
geophysical, xenobiological or astrophysical specialist to provide
detailed analysis of the sensor data.  

Nearly half of the Nuphraitelle\'s volume is taken up by the three main
cargo bays, each with a capacity of nearly 9000 cubic meters of storage,
letting the Nuphraitelle haul impressive amounts of goods from the
worlds it visits.

Quarters for the crew, 10 middle passengers and 4 high passengers are
standard, as are 10 low berths, suitable for passengers or livestock.
The Captain, of course, recieves his own large stateroom.

The standard crew\'s complement, beyond the bridge crew and officers,
includes 2 pilots for the small craft, 2 ship\'s troops for defense and
security, a Science Officer, and a Broker specialist to aid the crew in
matters of speculative trading.  2 Medical specialists and 2 Stewards
round out the complement.

Although the Nuphraitelle\'s thrusters are only capable of 1-gee
accelleration, the structure of the ship has been designed to withstand
twice that stress.  1-gee of contragravity and streamlining make
atmospheric interface and flight safe on any world, terrestrial or
gas-giant.  The Nuphraitelle\'s redundant wilderness fueling capability
can scoop and purify a jump\'s worth of fuel in less than 6 hours.  

A spacious hanger for a 100 ton shuttle has been provided, as well as
more modest facilities for a 20 ton ship\'s boat.  The shuttle bay,
although taking up a full 10% of the ship\'s volume, give extra
flexibility to the ship\'s crew in transporting cargo, passengers or
handling emergency situations.  Starwerx recommends the Starwerx Mule-98
Shuttle, with it\'s 4-gee performance and 75-ton cargo capacity (only
57.90MCr)

The Nuphraitelle is the first of Starwerx line of spacecraft and
starcraft to feature the Mk3 systems automation, reducing the workload
on the crew, but as with all Starwerx starships, redundant life-support
and control systems are standard.  A Starwerx Mk8 \'Rambler\' class self
defense package is included: 2 quad laser cannon, 2 sandcaster
batteries, nuclear damper and meson screen.

As the Nuphraitelle\'s mission profile includes long duration missions
away from Class A and B starports, a machine shop, engineering shop and
sickbay are present.  The 100 ton shuttle can be used to evacuate up to

Options available in order to increase the cargo capacity of the
Nuphraitelle are:

	-removing the collapsable fuel bladders (589.40 std additional cargo)
	-using parts of the shuttle bay and the shuttle cargo bay (~200 std &
75 std)
	-using the ships boat for storage (less than 20 std)

``Traveller,\'\' an original and intensely engaging movie, belongs to this

Irish-American gypsy clans who call themselves Travellers - is one we\'ve
never seen before. 

Descended from Ireland\'s indigenous horse-trading scam artists, the
Travellers came over with their more reputable countrymen in the
great waves of 19th century immigration. Like all other gypsies, the
Travellers live by a code that stringently divides the population into us
and them, and everyone outside the clan is legitimate prey. About the
most you can say for their ethos is that fraud, not violence, is their
thing. "

Zhunastu School of Contact anyone?

(Unrelated rant warning....)

Nope, not Traveller at all...notice this blurb that "violence is not their
thing" Nope oh no, not Traveller, where apparently ANY starship that
doesn\'t have 600 gajillion watt lasers and 43 spinal deep meson batteries,
and several thousand missiles can\'t _possibly_ call itself a Free Trader.

Folks...this months THUDD competition was supposed to be a BREAK from
military ships! all it seems to have engendered is yet ANOTHER discussion
about whose meson gun or laser is bigger. 

Ok, I\'ll go have a beer and calm down now.

I\'d like to pick on the scientific front....

Quoth Carlos Alos-Ferrer:

> Llyrn		0931	D333AAA-A		Na Po Hi	933	F8 VI

I could have sworn I remembered you describing the Llyrn as heavy-
worlders, though I may just be confusing them with their more muscular
human patrons.  :-)  But an Earth-density world 3,000 miles in diameter
would have a gravity of some 0.375 g\'s, which doesn\'t give me too much
confidence in the inhabitants\' fighting ability in close quarters.  (Their
digging prowess might assist in that, of course, but you don\'t specify how
they do it -- strong claws?  acid expectorant?)  The close quarters they
evolved in and still inhabit wouldn\'t give me great confidence either in
any natural evolved ability, say, with missile weapons -- unlike humans,
they have no open savannahs on which to practice hurling for millions of
years.  Again, perhaps Geonee training of some elite cadres would help.
But I\'d like to know how these guys get such a studly reputation.... :-)

The "looser" side of me accepts the caves willingly, the crankier side
wants to know how they got there.  Does anybody on TML know how lava tubes
form?  I know there\'s suspicion that we might find such on the Moon, which
implies that they can form in a vacuum.  I also seem to remember that
large hollows can be formed when a magma reservoir "drains away" from
beneath a volcano.  Llyrn\'s low gravity would also assist in preventing
collapses in caves that wouldn\'t survive on Earth.

The geothermal energy sources is a nice touch, but begs the question: what
precisely is the biochemistry upon which Llyrnian life is based?  With a
type 3 atmosphere ("very thin") it isn\'t likely to be based much on gas
exchange.  IIRC, Earth\'s geothermally supported life doesn\'t rely on
atmosphere either.  So what does primitive (and, thence, more advanced)
Llyrnian life subsist on?  Does it use sulfur instead of oxygen?  Do more
advanced Llyrnian life forms "eat" sulfur, hoarding it in specially-
evolved "lung" pouches for later metabolism, to allow travel outside the
rich, comfortable volcanic areas?  "Life support" for Llyrnian caves would
thus consist of heating and sulfur-conveyors.

One could posit, I suppose, that "very thin" is the _surface_ pressure,
but that there\'s more atmosphere lower down, and perhaps even liquid water
(which would freeze and/or evaporate at lower pressures, I believe).  But,
again, Llyrn\'s weak gravity foils that, since the pressure gradient is
likely to be too small to allow that except for caves unbelievably low
down in the crust.  And I have trouble believing that caves totally sealed
off from the surface and holding higher internal pressure could survive
over evolutionary time-scales.

Alternately, perhaps the Llyrn could be modeled somewhat on the Eshaar
Ashah of the Keith brothers\' FASA adventure "Ordeal by Eshaar".  That
planet had a hot, dense, insidious atmosphere, but perhaps the volcanic
vents would provide a similar environment in the immediate area.  To quote
a few relevant bits: "Surface atmospheric pressure: ...average lowland --
c. 3000mm [how many mmHg to an atm?  770?  That makes almost 4atm, which
is too much for Llyrnian caves to hold].  Atmospheric composition: CO2
83%; N2 9%; Si02 4%; other nitrogen and oxide compounds 2%.  Cloud
composition: H2O (steam)  46%; S (liquid) 40%; H2SO4 10%; HNO3 2%; HF
2%....  [Eshaar has] a mean surface temperature of 150 C.  Both liquid
sulfur and sulfuric acid serve as water in an environment where water
exists only as steam and where all other oxygen is locked up in sulfur,
carbon, and mineral oxides.... Native life forms are silicone-based....
The crystalline formations that pass for plants on Eshaar take liquid
sulfur and gaseous water from the environment and manufacture sulfuric
acid.  Animals use sulfuric acid in sustained electro- chemical reactions
with various metals (generally zinc or copper)  [JLL:  another reason for
tunneling!] within their bodies and give off as metabolic by-products
liquid sulfur and steam.  Many life forms, both plant and animal,
metabolize the atmosphere directly; most share in the water-sulfur-
sulfuric acid cycle.  Eshaaran life forms have been referred to as \'living
storage batteries.\'" 

Again, there are multiple problems with the comparison, but perhaps it\'s
food for thought.

> a visual band which circles the whole head

I think such a distributed visual system would probably be a weak one --
which would be reasonable given the subterranean origins of the Llyrn.
What is their primary sense?  Smell and hearing would be unlikely if they
exist in a thin atmosphere -- as would, unfortunately, the sonar you
posit.  Perhaps, mole-like, they rely on sensing vibrations in the
surrounding rock and soil?

> 	The Llyrnians are basically tunnel-dwellers (they dwell the tunnels
> "upwards" using all three arms)

Quick usage note: "dwell" in modern English simply means "inhabit".  I
suspect you mean "dig" above, or possibly "delve", which is an archaic
word.

> Their vision centers on the infrared part of the spectrum.

Reasonable, if their evolutionary ancestors grew up relying on geothermal
vents.  Again, though, a "vision ribbon" isn\'t likely to be terribly
precise (not that IR vision is -- such long-wavelength light yields very
"fuzzy" images anyway).

> [At first contact] Llyrn was then at TL 3, but the population had
> already exceeded the one thousand figure.

I should hope so!  There have been over a thousand humans at least since
the modern form evolved, and I\'d be surprised if a race could make it to
TL3 in such numbers without dangerous inbreeding.

Another comment: you don\'t mention how the three sexes work.  Does one
provide the egg, fertilized at different times by the other two?  Do the
three have to get together at the same time?  Do Llyrn lay eggs or bear
live young?

> a demographic explosion occurred.

Grammar nit: a "demographic explosion" would imply that the Llyrn were
suddenly exposed to a plague of census/survey takers.  You mean simply
a "population explosion."

> The effectiveness of the Llyrnians in boarding operations and
> infiltration operations was terrible.

I\'ve given reasons above why this might be so (their "effectiveness... was
terrible"), but I don\'t think that\'s what you really mean.  :-)  Try
"fearsome" instead.

All in all, an excellent write-up -- and I know it\'s mean to be a simple
sketch.  I\'ve just pointed up the areas where I think more detail is
needed to make the race a believable one (and hopefully, in doing so, an
all the more interesting one!).

I like this!  I\'ve been trying to add a bit of uncertainty to the mindset
of our PC pilot (skill = 4)...  He rarely fouls up.  This will add the
chance of "normal" failure when he\'s trying something very difficult...  

I haven\'t looked at the various likelihoods involved...  Does this cause

I like the idea as well, but I\'m curious about the numbers.  I\'d be

As to the advantages of megacorps vis a vis free traders, a big one is 
liquid capital ... most free traders just dont have the cash up front
to buy the truly profitable cargos ... eg a Fat Trader carrying an 
entire cargo of PGMP-12s, to re-equip a planetary army. Whats that 
goanna cost, in cash up front ??? OTOH the potential profits are 
likewise huge - 10% profit on a 100 megacredit cargo is more than 100% 
profit on a 5 megacredit cargo. But most free traders dont have the 
capital to plonk down - they are usually scraping up mortgage payments.
Thus the domination of the megacorps - people trust LSP when they 
promise to pay the 10 megacredits in 6 months, in a way they dont trust
Joe Trader.

The other advantage is long-term relationships. If you show up on a regular
schedule and deliver on promises, people trust you more. Megacorps can also
do lots of favours for planetary governments and so on, which will be 
returned in spades, in the form of preferential deals. Corporations have 
sales staff permanently on planets, looking for deals week in week out. Free
Traders need to find a cargo in six days or less.

We always used the simple explanation. If the surface g exceeds the
drive rating, then you don\'t land, much less takeoff. So you either use
the orbital station (if there is one) or you don\'t visit. 

The first group had a Scout with a scout ship. So they were in pretty
good shape. When they got around to looking at traders they were a bit
picky... :-)

Index of refraction = c/(speed of light in material)

So in diamond, with an index of refraction of 2.42, means that light
travels at 1/2.42 of c.

And the orbital period (year) would have to be *exactly* divisible by
the rotational period (day). Otherwise you get a different line every
year. 

Oh yeah, if the orbit is so circular that you can\'t accurately
determine the apogee, you can\'t determine the prime meridian (zero
line) either.

A workable suggestion is that until an "official" prime meridian is
determined, use the meridian where local noon matches noon UTC on the
day of discovery. 

After mapping the surface from orbit, then you pick a "reasonable"
prime meridian according to things like distribution of hydro
percentage, notable landmarks, etc. If there are natives, use theirs if
they have a consensus (earth didn\'t until the mid 1800s).

Well, there\'s a cute idea John W. Campbell had in one of his stories.
The weapon was gravity based, so it released its energy at the center
of mass of the target. You have to aim close enough, but once it gets
within range the "pulse" homes on the CoM by itself. 

The nice difference between this and the Meson gun is that it goes for
a pretty specific point. So once the enemy catches on, they build ships
with an empty CoM and lots of armor around the empty space!

Of course if your *other* weaponry manages to break off a big chunk of
the ship, then the CoM shifts. That also means that you have to be
careful about placing cargo and fuel so as to keep the COM in the
armored area. :-)

In short, it\'s *way* too much trouble for merchants to bother with, and
a pain to deal with on military ships. Which strikes me as being pretty
normal. :-)

Actually, it\'d require several *days* of obervation to even *begin* to
determine the orbit\'s parameters. While in theory an observation of the
planet\'s position and velocity would give an exact orbit, in the real
world the problem is that you need to determine the position and
velocity *of the center of the planet* with respect to the center of
the star. And you need it to fairly high accuracy. Centimeters make a
difference when there are months or years for them to add up.

I\'d say that a *week* of observations would give semi reliable data for
the inner orbits. For outer orbits, it could take months or years. 

Figure that you need around 5% of the orbit observed to get a
reasonable baseline. That *should* let you get within a few hundred
diameters when you return to the system later.

This is the second post making this assumption, so I\'d better jump in.
Going three parsecs in a Jump 1 ship onnly takes three weeks if the
ship has the fuel to make three sequential jumps without refueling and
is jumping to empty hexes for all but the last one.

The next "quickest" is if you are jumping via systems not worth
stopping at (Port types EFX?), and gas giant refueling. Even then,
there will be a day or two of time taken betwee jumps.

The *normal* situation is that the ship jumps to another world, spends
a week there, then jumps to a second world, spends another week, then
jumps to the third system. That\'s *five* weeks. 

The only way to get a captain to forego the intermediate stops is by
buying *all* the passenger and cargo slots.

The basic formula for time to cover distance this way is:

Well, if you can build a purification plant that\'s small enough to put
in the missile, it\'ll hang around for a *long* time. 

As for keeping them at a constant depth, use a balloon. 

Minor problem is what kind of sensors are they going to be using? If
they are at all "deep" the sensor range drops to the point where it is
useless. Gas Giants are *very* noisy at radio and radar wavelengths,
and not very transparent at IR, visual or UV wavelengths.

Humans *already* have an ovipositor. It delivers modified, mobile ova
called "sperm". It\'s a heavily modified clitoris called the penis.

So just "back track" things a bit. Modify the X chromosome a bit and
eliminate the Y. The urethra is as in a woman. The clitoris is modified
to be larger and when engorged is finger thick and about a foot long.
It\'s also prehensile so as to be able to connect more easily (a trait a
number of mammals have)

One fallopian tube connects to the modified clitoris, the other to the
uterus. Which means that the Sayat desire to pentrate or be pentrated
depending on which ovary produces the egg. If both are active (that\'s
how you get fraternal twins), then they either try for a double
pentration (not easy!) or waste the ova routed thru the clitoris. Or
they screw themselves!

This is likely to be pretty easy as genetic engineering goes. The
"unfinished" bits would be minor details such as the fact that you have
to stay coupled for the better part of an hour to give the ovum time to
travel the required distance. That\'s because they don\'t have any sort
of "seminal fluid" to wash it thru. Or at least not much.

From this I deduce two more details. The Sayat "tie" like dogs and
certain other critters, and they likely have mindblowing orgasms the
whole time to encourage them to stay linked or else they fall asleep
until the exchange is completed. There\'s no such thing as a
"quicky". And it makes mating rather invloved and time consuming.

Hmmm. I can think of arguments both ways on the long orgasm vs short &
sleep issue. Oh well.

Assuming that you believe Freudian psychologists, this makes the Sayat
very, *very* unhuman. No "castration fear", no real difference between
mother and father (and *both* are potential partners except for any
taboos the society may have). I expect there\'s a taboo against having
sex with yourself, as that\'d be much worse than incest genetically
speaking.

It takes as long as it takes. So that means that it\'s 11 minutes
between when they send something and when it is received. Then it takes
however long it takes for the folks to respond to what was received.
Then it\'s *another* 11 minutes before the answer is received.  So the
lag is *twice* the distance as far as anyone at either end is concerned.

BTW, did you allow for the fact that the planet and station will likely
be in different parts of their orbits? Possibly even on opposite sides
of the star?

*All* electromagnetic radiation travels at c. Light, Xray, UV, IR,

stuff.

Well, for planetary positions, you figure the length of the year (the
formulas are in most of the expanded world detailing systems. You need
mass of the star, and orbital radius). pick an arbitrary number between
0 and 360. That\'s where the planet started out (at whatever "base date"
you use). Figure the number of days since then, divide that by the
length of the year. Throw away the integer part (unless you want to
know how many local years it has been since the base date). Multiply
the fractional part by 360 and add in the starting position. If greater
than 360, subtract 360. That\'s the orbital position of the planet
(measured from an arbitary baseline). 

For time lag, you figure the positions and distances. And figure that
if the line of sight comes within a few degrees of the star, it isn\'t
possible to communicate except by realying thru another planet or
station that has a better line of sight (in which case you have to
figure the lag each way on each *leg* of the trip).

If the lag is only a few seconds (like earth to moon) ignore it, it\'s
not worth figuring. If it\'s a few minutes, it\'s going to make
conversation impossible. You might try *simulating* it by having
players write down what they are sending, hand it to you, and you hand
it to the other player after the right amount of time has passed. If
you just *suggest* this, it\'ll get the lag across to the players. 

But essentially, beyond a few light seconds your communication reverts
to being "email". So they are going to be *real* cramped....

If they are in the middle of a fight and send for help, they aren\'t
going to get saved, but they might get avenged...

There are radio wavelengths that bounce off the ionisphere, but shorter
wavelngths will go right through. The break point is somewhere between
CB frequencies (27 Mhz?) and TV frequencies (50 MHz?).

And being near a powerful transmitter is dangerous only to the extent
that the body interacts with the frequencies. Anything longer than 2
meters wavelength has waves that are a lot bigger than the body, and
thus sort of "skip over" insignificant things like people. You can
still get RF burns if you get close enough to the antenna for the
voltage to arc over. 

Things don\'t really get dangerous until you hit frequencies like the
resonant frequencies of various molecules in the body. Then they start

You only need 3, unless geosynch orbit is *really* close to the planet
(which requires unreasonably fast rotations for the planet). The
signals will be a bit hard to receive near the poles, but that can be
handled via the *local* comm-net. Likely to be something like the
Motorla Iridium system or one of it\'s competitors. 60-100 satellites in
low orbit, each acting like a cell phone site. The long range comm
systems at geosynch orbit would tie into this if you were trying to
call someone.

I\'d see the sequence as being like this:

Surface fixed
	high bandwidth via fiber optics or similar technology. Good
	for point to point on planetary surfaces.

Surface/Air mobile
	Either tying into cell sites that are part of the fiber network
        (high bandwidth) or using low orbit satellites (lower bandwith)
        Or both.

Orbit to Surface/Air
	Either direct to ground station which ties into surface net, or
	to satellite station (geosynch?) that relays to a ground
	station or to the low orbit net.

Orbit to orbit
	Direct, or via link thru planetary geosynch net.

Interplanetary (anything over a few light seconds)
	link between planetary geosynch nets when line of sight
	possible. When LOS not possible, relay thru another planet or
	station. 

To organize it by nets rather than distances:

Surface Net
	a network using fixed links wired (or fiber optic) between
	fixed points. Bandwidth limited by switching systems (telephone
	model) or by capacity of major links/routers (Internet model)
	Used for point to point and ground to ground "broadcast" (think
	"cable TV")
	Has links to Low Orbit Net, High Orbit Net.

Low Orbit Net
	A network of satellite relays accessed by terminals much like
	cell phones. Bandwidth tends to be lower than Surface net due
	to limits on number of frequencies available.
	Used for mobile point to point.
	Has links to Surface Net, High Orbit Net.

High Orbit Net
	Composed of three or more satellites in Clarke orbits
	(geosynchronous and equatorial), possibly supplemented by a
	pair of polar statites (stations using solar sails to counter
	gravity and stay directly over each pole, usually at *large*
	distance due to dynamical concerns).
	Used for orbit to ground broadcast, and as relay points for
	ground/orbit orbit/orbit and interplanetary traffic.
	Has links to Interplanetary Net, Surface Net, Low Orbit Net,
	X-boat Net.

Interplanetary Net
	Composed of the High Orbit Net of the mainworld and any other
	High Orbit Nets in the system, as well as major stations and
	ships more than a few light seconds out from the ships/stations.
	Used for interplanetary and planet to ship/station traffic.
	
Xboat Net
	See rules. :-)

Note that the High Orbit Nets can be composed of unmanned units, thus
allowing a world to have both a high orbit and low orbit net for only a
few million credits. The statites are more used for the interplanetary
links, as their positions are the easiest to track. Not that it matters
a lot, even maser beams tend to spread enough to hit the whole planet
and even the statites (at a light second or more!) when travelling
interplanetary distances. The low orbit net is *always* unmanned.

The low orbit net is actually somewhat optional, as it\'s only needed if
you have a lot of mobile stations, don\'t want *millions* of cell sites
on the ground, and don\'t want the long time lag that relaying thru a
high orbit satellite will give. 

I expect that the Vilani don\'t like low orbit nets, but the Terrans
like them, both because they can be setup quickly around a world rather
than having to put in a lot of infrastructure on the ground and because
they provide redundancy for the surface net. That redundancy is the
only good thing about such nets if you ask the Vilani. :-)

Low pop worlds may have *only* a low orbit net, and no surface net.
High pop worlds will *always* have a surface net, and probably a low
orbit net as well depending on circumstances.

	Err, not quite, as the shuttle flies above the atmosphere, not in it (is
the ionosphere not the upper layer of the atmosphere?). IIRC correctly,
NASA was playing with, basically, a giant generator. For a generator, all
you need to do is move a conductor through a magnetic field. That\'ll cause
a current flow. The earth has a very large magnetic field ... stretch out a
very long conductor, and let the current flow!

	A generator can also be reversed and operated as a motor. This idea has
also been proposed as a way to raise and lower a satellite\'s orbit: if you
pass a current through a conductor in the presence of a magnetic field, it
creates a force on the conductor. So instead of tapping juice off, you pump
juice in.

Oookay, so: for those of us who are local, is it worth going to?  How big a

I guess I like the DGP overdrive explanation better.  It seems to me 
that the free traders, intended for use on backwater worlds, would 
not be that limited in landing;/taking off from worlds.

Especially subsidized merchants.  These ships are created to service 
worlds off the mains, and they only have a 1G M-Drive.

How could the government expect worlds that are off the beaten path 
to be serviced if the ships they are subsidizing to service them 
cannot land/take off from many of them?

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

That was driving me nuts, and I know I\'ve seen it a hundred times.  I 
kept looking in the Space Travel section of the different rules sets 
I have where it lists info on the TAS.

I didn\'t think to look under the mustering out benefits.  That\'s 
exactly what I needed, and the same rule is on page 24 of T4 Book 1.

Eventhough the book says the TAS hotels are located at "all class A 
and B starports in human space", I like your idea of limiting it by 
population.

As a general rule, what do you use as the population cut of point--or 
do you just wing it on a case by case basis?

I stand corrected then!  But, I think that I liked the plot of game 
#1 better, although both were good ideas.

A mix of the two, taking the best features of each game, would have 
been an dynamite combination.

I see.  That was hard for me to do.  I felt like I was working the 
same problem on the same screen each time.  I was really disappointed 
in that part of the game.

I actually stumbled upon these games in the "old" section of a 
computer game store about five years ago.  I think I bought the 
first one for $15, and the second for only $5!

I consider myself lucky to have found these.  I didn\'t even know 
Traveller had computer games, and until your post, I didn\'t know that 
a third one was planned.

I\'d like to see IG  come  up with a good Traveller computer game.

But since the cost is directly linked to the number of people carried on 
the ship, only those items that are used up because you have an extra 
person aboard are covered. Now, one credit is worth approximately 1.5 to
2 US$. Do you really think that it\'s reasonable that a person consumes
about 3-4000 US$ worth of consumables in one 10-day trip?

Different mileage, I suppose. I find it irritating not knowing what the
money pays for. As far as I can see most of it is burnt as a sacrificed

So don\'t mix it with 02. Besides, you can\'t get around the fact that if
refined fuel costs much more than Cr250 per ton, then it becomes more
economic even for a small ship to install a fuel purifier plant and buy
unrefined fuel.

It was... in Book 2. Then they introduced jump governors.

Well, if you rip a hole into Jump-2 Space and jumps 5 meters then you pay
for a jump-2. But if you rip a hole into Jump-1 Space and jump the same 5
meters then you only pay for a jump-1. A jump governor allows a jump-2
engine to rip holes into both Jump-1 and Jump-2 Space.

Yes, because there is no jumpspace lower than Jump-1 Space.

Well, I can\'t say for sure what Megatraveller and TNE says on the subject.
I just had a quick look through T4 and couldn\'t find anything either way
on the subject.

_No_ it\'s not & not all ships have 50-100 g turns of fuel anyway.

Consider the following  FF&S design

The Emperor\'s Amusement  TL 15/16 (sensors & computers at Tl 16 the rest
at TL15)

This ship was constructed in 1083 at Capitol/Core and is an Imperial
Household vessel and the prototype for a new class of rift patrol
vehicles.  It is based on a standard patrol cruiser hull & is almost
identical externally (3 turrets not 4). (Details of Mass, MW required,
MCr cost, SA required & (in some cases) Volume are excluded due to my
laziness but they are all correct in the original design).  Its mission
design was to cross the great rift the hard way or patol within the
rift. 

Fuel related design details

Hull 400 ton (5600 m^3) 

Jump 6 drive			vol 392

Jump 6 Fuel			vol 1960
Power Plant Fuel		vol 14
HEPlaR Fuel (32 g burns)	vol 600
1 g burn = 18.75m^3
Collapsible Fuel bladder	vol 655.34
tankage	( for 1 jump 2 (+2m^3) or 34.95 additional g burns)

Fixed Fuel Tank Total vol = 2336 (42.25% of ships vol)
total w/ collapsible fuel bladder = 2991.34 (53.42% of ships vol)

This FFS design uses less fuel for 1 jump 6 + 1 jump 2 & some g burns &
power plant fuel (or even a jump6 + jump 3 if you dont use very many g
burns) than a CT of T4 ship does just for 1 jump 6 with no other fuel.
This ship design was expressly made for the rift & you _cannot_ make a
CT or T4 design that can do this !

very similar MT design (which cost 110 MCr more but was very
functionally similar)

Suz why not adverise on usenet, try the rec.games.rpg.misc group I\'m sure 
people on there would love to know about traveller chat.

The rule a fairly clear on large megacorps as _shipping_ concerns and
the economics rules present speculative trade as an addition is
shipping.  You could rewrite the trade rules so that trading
is the primary aspect of a ship owner (change broker skill
to primarily finding cargos to _buy_ rather than _ship_, put
the up front money for speculation in with the down payment
for the ship as the startup money, etc.)  But then you would
problably drop out the fixed charge for cargo anyone since,
if shipping was a minor aspect of trade, then nobody would
bother to regulate it.

My general rule is that a population factor of at least 5 must be
present but I do make exceptions for certain cases. Low pop/high TL
worlds and high pop/low TL worlds are exceptions. The former may have
a TAS facility while the latter may not, depending on the reasons
for the UWP being so bizarre.

I received an \'possible error\' message while uploading, and was then cut off,

problem.

Changes in this version:

1) Preferences file now works, so settings are remembered from one session to
the next.

2) Hooks for different cultures added (in Preferences dialog) but not yet
implemented.  I\'ll probably do Hivers next, or the Two Thousand Worlds, but
if you have any urgent requests...

3) One scrolling bug fixed.  Two more to go (that I know of).

4) Languages modified to include a \'word length\' table.  This is non-canon,
but you non-heretics can always stick with the old-fashioned 1-6 syllable
words (which is the default anyway).  I\'ve already typed in data for all the
languages I could find (or have made up).

5) Animals can now be named automatically when the animal encounter table is
generated.  


Keep the bug reports, wish lists, and money flowing :-)

BayCon is a major regional SF con (not a game con) held every year in San
Jose.  It attracts about 2000 people, and some very interesting guests.
This year\'s Writer Guest of Honor is Jack L. Chalker (Midnight at the Well
of Souls), the Artist Guest of Honor is Bob Eggleton (Dark Horse comics,
some Analog and Asimov\'s covers.) also appearing are David Brin, Marion
Zimmer Bradley, Frank Kelly Freas, and many others...

BayCon features a strong science track, with panels both on real and
speculative science and engineering.  They are boasting that the panelists
include "two astrophysicists, an encryption R&D engineer, a technician from
a local coroner\'s office, and an Investigator from the FAA."

The traditional Con activities, filking, masquerade, dealers\' room, Regency
dancing, room parties, and art show will all be happening.  One unique
event happens Saturday and Sunday night, with the Dive-In Movie (not a
typo)  Old and very bad SF is projected on one wall of the hotel, above the
swimming pool.  Fans watch from the pool, aka the 0-g simulation enviroment
viewing platform.  

Registration is $50 through May 15th for all four days.  $60 thereafter.
One day memberships are available at the con for $15-$20 depending on the day.

You can contact BayCon at:

info@baycon.org

or

BayCon \'97
P.O. Box 610427
San Jose, Ca.  95161-0427

I\'ll be there all four days, so if people want to meet for dinner or
somesuch, we can arrange something.  This really a great con, I encourage
people to attend.

I think that the answer to this question will be different in Milieu 0
but in Milieu 1100 I usually use the rule that TAS will _always_ be
found at class A starports, will be at all class B starports not on low
pop planets, and will usually be found at class C starports on high pop
worlds &  very rarely at other class C starports.  

Another factor you may want to consider is TAS facilities on Amber zoned
planets.  I assume that an Amber zone will not deter TAS from providing
a facility there because the members will need it more & that (arguably)
amber zones are often "interesting" & are thus more likely to attract
TAS members. If you think that TAS is somewhat more risk averse you
might say that TAS facilities are less likely to be found or even cannot
be found on amber zoned worlds.  If you are a real cynic about _who_
decides to amber zone a world you could assume that if & when TAS is
kicked off a planet they promptly go to their good friends in the
Imperial government & get the planet amber zoned. (Unspoken premise
"Anyone who would kick _us_ out must be barbarians").

    'body' => 'An earlier posting questioned the dangers of high-powered communications
equipment. Without being too specific, in the military I worked with
medium-powered (200+ watts range) radio transmitters that broadcast
primarily in frequencies that pass easily through the ionosphere. The
minimum official \'safe distance\' was 15 meters from the antenna (we
occasionally used the whip antenna to cook hotdogs - hot in 20-30
seconds, on fire in 2 minutes). Radios in that power range could
broadcast to great distances - probably to Mars with proper reception
equipment (and during close approach). They would also cook anyone using
them at walkie-talkie/backpack size.
 Unfortunately, atmospheres \'eat up\' a lot of RF power in most
traditional radio freq. bands (the thicker, the worse. High humidity
equals less power-to-receiver). Therefore portable radios for
communicating with orbiting ships will need a fair amount of power to be
useful on a wide variety of worlds (especially with exotic atmospheres,
high-density, etc.). In a recent game on a planet with a thick, damp
atmosphere with a lot of \'ground-clutter\' my players (more
radioheads)actually set up a base radio to communicate with a distant
ship and carried lower powered backpack radios - the base station
relayed to the ship.
 In space, though, it may be easier. With little to no solar activity in
a system with an F, G, or K star you could probably communicate over
most of the system with 5-10 WATTS! ANY solar activity, though, and you
will suddenly need a tremendous amout of power to even try to
communicate. A few years ago most communications in North America were
knocked out for up to 2 hours by a relatively average solar flare - and
we had an ionosphere to protect us!

Don\'t hold your breath waiting for this to happen. I tried to explain away
the TL 14 vacc suits in CSC as artifacts from a contemporary TL 14 system.
Then Emperor\'s Arsenal states TL 15 is "maximum known Second Imperium
technology".  I don\'t even bother trying to rationalize this stuff anymore.

Jump govenors are mentioned in the SOM, but no mention is made that 
these help regulate fuel use.

Where did you get the formula for fuel use on a ship that jumps lower 
than it\'s jump number (i.e. a jump-2 ship that only jumps one 
parsec)?

review.

Don\'t worry.  I won\'t give anything away.

The special effects in the movie were very good.  There were some 
funny moments.  Don\'t go into this film thinking that it is going to 
be as great as Aliens was, but if you are in the right mood, it is 
definitely worth watching.

I\'d give it a 3 out of 5 stars, but I\'m pretty hard on movies and it 
takes quite a spectacular film for me to rate it high.

Bruce did a good job as the main character, but you are just going to 
fall in love with the female lead--Sombody (Millie?) Jonovich.  She 
is just incredible.  Oscar performance--no kidding.  All the nuances, 
all the life, all the strength, all the fragileness portrayed by this 
actress will just capture you.

There\'s a lot of technology in the film, and some of it can be 
applied to Traveller.  I found a lot of it to be too high tech, 
though (they cloned a person from just a piece of a hand in about 5 
minutes--the shake and bake method for regeneration!).

The guns look pretty cool, but they have a WarHammer 40K feel to 
them.

The aliens are pretty cool, and what they can do with CG these days 
is just incredible.

And, there was good acting throughout the film--much more than you 
would expect in a film like this.  There\'s this one scene with a cop, 
and it\'s very short.  The cop, though, is played in such a way that 
you really get a feel for this blue-collar bloke just doing his job.  
Too many times in movies like this, cops are there just to give the 
main character something to shoot at--kinda like the Storm Troopers 
in Star Wars (faceless, no personality, no feeling that this is a 
real person).  Many of the bit parts in this movie, though, are done 
in such a way that you believe that these are real people.

The directing ranged from "just incredible" to "why did he do it that 
way."  Luc Besson directed the film.  He\'s the guy who did La Femme 
Nikta, Point of No Return, and the The Professional.  I really liked 
The Professional, but this film had some moments too.

One of the great parts is when this alien opera diva is singing.  
This scene could have been done a million different ways, but Besson 
really brought out the beauty in it.  It wasn\'t like the band scene 
in Return of the Jedi.  In this film, eventhough it was an alien 
singing, you really feel like you are experienceing a true, beautiful 
work of art as this creature sings.  This is intercut with a combat 
scene so that we continue to hear the diva\'s incredible song while we 
watch parts of a melee fight.  It is a great sequence.

On the other hand, Besson chooses to use this intercut technique in 
another part of the film, intercuting several concurrent scence that 
really have no bearing on the film and do not move the story forward, 
and this is just not done that well.  When you get through seeing it, 
you wonder to yourself, "Why did I just watch that?  What does it 
have to do with the plot?"

The story is somewhat convoluted.  I like the apocolyptic theme that 
runs throughout, but it does not live up to its fullest potential.  
Several things in the movie happen that (a) really don\'t need to be 
in the film, or (b) are not fully explained by the time the film 
ends.

I left the film thinking that this could have been an incredible 
movie--if just by some of the performances alone.  But, boil it all 
down, and you get a servicable Sci Fi flick.

If you are in the mood for a movie like this (it\'s kind of a Stargate 
meets Judge Dredd), then you might want to go see it, and you\'ll 
probably be glad you did.

If you go in expecting an incredible work of SciFi art, you are going 
to be dissappointed because this film is definitely more like 
Independence Day rather than Aliens.

There\'s no mystery about how lava tubes form. A fast flowing stream of
forms a crust on the outside, and that\'s the beginning of the wall of
the tube. When the eruption stops or at least the flow to that stream
stops, the remaining lava keeps flowing, leaving behind the hardened
tube. Add the occasional flow on top of the tube(s) and you have a
reasonably stable tube system.

I would say it\'s the Navy/Marines that are the heavy guns. However, they\'re 
expensive, relatively small, and don\'t have much staying power. The Army 
probably doesn\'t have the same devastating firepower, and it\'s slower to 
react, but it has the numbers required to occupy a world and/or absorb heavy 
casualties.

as far as I\'ve read.  Chapter 1, Antecedents of the Third Imperium, 
with its constant theme of honorable vs. dishonorable, is classic 
propaganda after the style of Digest Group Publications.  Chapter 2, 
the Expansion Process, is delightfully cynical.  (E.g.: "The denuding 
of the wealth of a nation called for in the early stages should serve 
to undermine the world\'s own currency by removing anything of physical 
value from backing it." p.19.)  

The Warrant of Restoration, set forth at pp. 83-84, has an enormous 
loophole in Article 1:  

"Any world may, through a recognized representative, proclaim 
allegiance to the Immperium, and in so doing, such world shall 
become a member in the Imperium, equal in status to all other 
members of the Imperium."  

Thus a non-member world has the power to become a member of the 
Imperium just be deciding to do so -- no approval by the rest of 
the Imperium, no proclamation by the Emperor, no advice and consent 
of the Moot, no standards (except Calendar Compliance).  

Article VIII doesn\'t help.  It just says, 

"Nothwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in 
this document or in subsequent Imperial actions, the Imperium, 
for the purpose of ensuring its continued safety and stability, 
reserves to itself the power to unilaterally enact changes in any 
or all aspects of the relationship between itself and any member 
world or citizen."

Article VIII only applies to relationships between the Imperium 
and worlds that are already members -- thus it does not provide 
for rejection of a world\'s application for membership.  It does 
allow the Imperium to kick a member world out, so an unwanted world 
could be booted after its admission.  There may be unwanted political 
fallout from doing so, of course, that would not be present if the 
world were simply not admitted.

Where might this problem arise?  (1) A world far from the Imperial 
sphere of influence could hear about the Imperium, join it, and then 
seek protection from its non-Imperial neighbors.  The Imperium could 
thus be drawn into a distant and unwanted war.  (Actually, that\'s not 
a bad adventure hook.)

(2) A group of highly developed worlds might decide to join the Imperium 
en masse.  Exploitation of these worlds, after the fashion of the Zhunastu 
School, would not be possible; indeed, their ability to exploit their 
neighbors would be enhanced.  It would be better if they could be rejected
for membership and then surrounded by the Imperium over time.  Then 
their economies could be destroyed by cutting off trade, and rebuilt as
dependent on the Imperium.

   I try not to think of movies in terms of "stars", but if I were to
assign such a value to this, I\'d also give it about a 3.  I saw it with
four other people, two of whom really loved it and wanted t stay and watch
it again, and the other two were indifferent at best-- one described it as
"Captain EO meets Hudson Hawk" which, while certainly harsh, does have an
element of truth.

Name\'s Milla Jovovich.  She\'s a model who\'s been in a few other
unimpressive movies ("Return to the Blue Lagoon" among others), I think
she had a music album a couple years ago, and she\'s romantically linked
with the director.  I agree that she gave a great performance, however the
portions of the movie which focused upn her were my least favorite.

     For what it\'s worth, Besson didn\'t direct "Point of No Return," that
was just an American remake of his film "La Femme Nikita."  I\'m on a
one-man crusade against "The Professional" which a lot of people seem to
like even though I thought it was a morally bankrupt pedophilic piece of
trash, but I suppose it was at least well-directed.  Besson also wrote the
screenplay for this, and I heard he came up with it when he was 14 years
old.  To me, that explained a lot-- the simplistic "moral," the flashy
action, the jokes in questionable taste, etc.  For better or worse, this
movie definitely felt like the product of an adolescent male mind.

I agree.  This was one of the best sequences in the film.

   The story as such I found to be pretty weak.  However, I really enjoyed
a lot of the somewhat-goofy complications which occurred, especially in
the middle-third of the movie-- the entire "subplot" involving the
Paradise world.  It had a definite comic-book feel to it that was a lot of
fun.  Certainly not a cinematic masterpiece, or in any way "serious"
science fiction, but still very entertaining if you\'re in the right mood.
One more proviso: I would reccomend seeing this movie on the biggest
screen with the best sound system available, and sitting pretty close to
the front.  There are a lot of great visuals in this movie that won\'t seem
nearly as impressive if seen on a dinky little screen (or, God forbid, a
tv).

	Ad Astra is pretty weedy and very small.  The gaming there is
almost non-existent.  The dealer\'s room is pretty feeble as well.  Of
course, you are only talking about an attendance of 300-400, tops.  Not
too bad for parties, but it is more of a lit SF con.

	It was good in \'95, but that was more of an exception than a rule
(I have been going since \'92).

	Toronto Trek is *much* better.  It has about 3,000-4,000 people, a
huge dealer\'s room,  and lots of media and lit. SF events.  It supports
Bab5, as well as other SF stuff (don\'t let the con name fool you).  There
is also a good deal of gaming, too (both RP and minis).  Mostly WOD and
Trav for RPing, and Heavy Gear, Jovian Chronicles, Dirtside II, and Space
Hulk for mini events.

  most of the commerce rules that I\'ve seen is _traffic_.
  Traffic is what defines trade _patterns_ (not specific
  products) and therefore likely _routes_, especially for the
  larger corps (it\'s called maximizing ROI).  These are just my
  thoughts on "building" traffic patterns.

  There are five types of destination, based on traffic.  The
  types and descriptions are as follows:

  PRIME destinations.  These are destinations which command the
            highest amount of traffic, regardless of starport
            class (except X).  Generally, they will have A or B
            ports, but not necessarily, and they will _always_
            have something that will naturally attract people,
            and generally will have more than one such thing.

            SECTOR CAPITALS and SUBSECTOR CAPITALS are always
            prime destinations; HOMEWORLDS for a MINOR RACE
            (human or otherwise) that is well-known and
            well-respected throughout the Imperium will also be
            prime destinations.  IMPERIAL NAVAL DEPOT systems
            will be prime destinations _if_ they are also worlds
            that are close to the Terra/Vland/Sylea (TVS) norms.
            The CENTRAL WORLD OF A CLUSTER will be a prime
            destination if (a) the cluster can be reached using
            jump-2 from a main, AND (b) the world is close to
            the TVS norms.  ANCIENT SITES will be a prime
            destination if the world is close to the TVS norm.

  HIGH destinations.  These are destinations which command a
            high amount of traffic, but not necessarily the
            highest.  Generally, these will have ports no lower
            than C.  There will be always be something that will
            naturally attract people; it is rare for more than
            one such thing to exist.

            ANCIENT SITES and IMPERIAL NAVAL DEPOTS that are not
            prime destinations will be high destinations.  MINOR
            RACE HOMEWORLDS with sector-wide renown and respect
            will be high destinations.  CENTRAL WORLDS OF
            CLUSTERS will be high destinations if they are not
            prime destinations.  Worlds WITHIN JUMP-3 OF A PRIME
            destination that also approach TVS norms are high
            destinations.

  MEDIUM destinations.  These worlds command a respectable
            amount of traffic.  They are preferred "hubs" for
            subsidized merchants and liners (high and prime
            would be even better, if the trade there wasn\'t
            pretty much snatched up by big corps).  They will
            always have D or better starports, and C or better
            is not an unreasonable expectation.

            TVS NORM worlds are always at least medium
            destinations, unless they are closed (interdicted)
            for some reason.  MINOR RACE HOMEWORLDS that are not
            high or prime destinations will be medium
            destinations.  CLUSTER WORLDS WITHIN JUMP-3 OF THE
            CENTRAL WORLD are medium destinations if they are
            not high or prime. NAVAL BASES, XBOAT STATIONS or
            SCOUT BASES OR WAY STATIONS on worlds that are not
            of higher status will be medium destinations.
            CLUSTER WORLDS THAT ARE ON THE ROUTE FROM A MAIN TO
            THE CENTRAL WORLD OF THE CLUSTER are medium
            destinations if they are not of higher status.

  LOW destinations.  These worlds command little traffic, and
            boast of little of interest to outsiders.

            All non-interdicted worlds with population that do
            not qualify for medium or better status are low
            destinations.

  CLOSED destinations.  These worlds command no traffic.  They
            are either totally barren, or interdicted.

  SPECIAL NOTE: If a world is a "choke point" between worlds
  of otherwise higher status, it is automatically of the same
  status as the lowest of the worlds.


  If using these descriptions as guidelines for sector
  generation, I would recommend assuming that your "normal"
  trade route generation routine assumes that all worlds are
  medium destinations.  For each level above medium that a world
  is, a favorable DM of 1 should be applied to the probability
  that a route will exist; for low, an unfavorable DM of 1
  should be applied; there should be no routes to a closed
  destination.

  Also, if using these guidelines to determine what kind of
  destination you have, I would use something like the following
  table - assume the default for a world is _low_ if there is
  nothing that automatically warrants a higher status:

  Characteristic          Amount
  ----          ----
  TVS Norm                +0.5
  Naval station           +0.25
  Scout base/way sta.     +0.25
  Artificial habitats     -0.5
        required
  Minor Race Homeworld    +0.5
  J-3 from cluster hub    +0.25
  Connect main and hub    +0.25

  Accumulate all DMs first, then round unfavorably.  Set the
  world to its automatic minimum level based on the descriptions
  above.  Then, ignoring anything that contributes to the
  automatic minimum status, accumulate "scores" from the above
  table, and round down.  If the result is 0 or less, there is
  no change in the type of destination.  If the result is
  1, raise the status by one level (i.e., a low world becomes a
  medium world).  Note that because of automatic status
  settings, it is not possible to have a final score of more
  than 1, i.e., an automatic MEDIUM destination can\'t be
  upgraded to PRIME.

  Example: A world is a Minor Race homeworld, but the minor race
  is not of any particular renown or importance.  It sports an
  Imperial Naval Station and a Scout base.  It is in a
  relatively isolated cluster (The cluster is not directly
  accessible from the nearest main without at least J-3), and is
  not the hub of the cluster, but it is only J-1 from the hub,
  and on the route to the main. It is not TVS norm, but
  unaltered humans can survive without artificial habitats.

  The Minor Race Homeworld status makes it automatically a
  MEDIUM destination.  We ignore this from the table.  We add
  0.25 for J-3 from cluster hub, 0.25 for the Naval base, 0.25
  for the scout base, and 0.25 for being on the route to the
  main.  There is a total "score" of 1, which moves this world
  from being a MEDIUM destination to being a HIGH destination.

  Had it had a NAVAL DEPOT instead of a NAVAL BASE, it would
  have automatically been a HIGH destination, and the scoring
  above would be changed by deducting 0.25 for the naval base,
  and adding 0.5 for the Minor Race Homeworld.  This would have
  resulted in a "score" of 1.25, rounding down is 1, as before,
  which would make it a prime destination.

  If the world had not been on the route to the main, the score
  would have been 0.75, which, rounded down, is 0, so there
  would have been no change in the status.

  If it had also been a TVS world, the score would have been
  1.5, rounding down is 1, so it would have been HIGH instead of
  MEDIUM.

I agree. The special effects were spectacular.

I can see that you do rate movies harshly. I\'d give it a 4. If I was 
feeling more generous, maaaybe a 4.5.

Hee. Actually, I thought the shake and bake thing was the only piece of 
technology too outlandish for most Traveller settings. The rest seemed 
quite reasonable and had imho that Travellerish "big steel/clunky tech" 
feel.

There were even some ancient artifacts... :-)

If you\'re talking about the scene I think you\'re talking about, I guess 
it was just done as a humourous interlude. I agree that it was 
superfluous, tho\'.

That\'s true. I think the last third of the movie or so could have used a 
little more editing... 

I mean, the opening scene was just incredible! It was a perfect setup for 
the rest of the movie.

>I left the film thinking that this could have been an incredible

Wellll, I thought it was more than serviceable. Stargate was serviceable. 
This was better than that. If only they\'d stay clear of the "put 
something in for the mass-market" syndrome, they\'d have had a true great 
sci-fi pic.

Stargate meets Judge Dredd! Thats *good* Kenneth. To qualify that, I 
think this movie was better than both of those movies.

>If you go in expecting an incredible work of SciFi art, you are going

>Independence Day rather than Aliens.

I see your point, but I would rate The 5th Element higher than ID4. 
Better performances, better plot, no "USA-rules/Aliens sux" claptrap.

Again, this movie fell into the "make it for the lowest common 
denominator" syndrome, and could have been better. But it still was 
really good.

Also, this movie is first and foremost, an *action* movie. The first 
Alien movie wasn\'t, it was a thriller/suspense movie. Keeping that in 
mind, I think The Fifth Element was a superior movie in its genre, just 
as Aliens was superior in its genre.

BTW, when you say this movie is no "Aliens" I hope you\'re just referring 
to the first one. ;-)

And that was my main point also (although Kenneth has said it much better).
A higher jump ship performing at below maximum jump will not maximise it\'s 
earnings (under the Per Parsec system) and will seldom be seen making less 
than
it\'s maximum jump.  Although it can, and probably will - especially in 
speculation.

The main thrust of this point is that most ships will be designed for a 
given set of trading circumstances and so if transportation prices are 
fixed then they should be a least fixed on a per parsec basis rather than a 
per jump basis.  (Just like real world slow mail)

While you can reach more planets that is no guarantee you can reach a 
better market.

Also, I feel that ships would be designed more specifically for their 
trading circumstances.  If you are in a sparse area then you will need a 
high jump (and more expensive ship).  If you are one a main then Jump 1 is 
all you need.

If the Imperium has set costs to be on a per jump basis (regardless of 
distance) then worlds in sparse area\'s will not be serviced by sufficient 
ships and so will fail.  As the Imperium is powered by Economics then it 
must allow traders (of all sizes) to make a reasonable profit and so Higher 
jump ships must be able to charge on a per parsec basis.

Then it becomes a matter of economics to start trading.  Trade on a main 
and your investment is reduced (and so are your returns).  Trade off a main 
and make a profit on your high jump legs and a loss on your low jump legs.

>Assuming that the surrounding region is all of average density (half the
>hexes have systems) ships can statistically expect to be able to reach
>the following number of planets

I feel that while their will be basic designs, these designs will still 
have a set role.  Such as trading on a main for the free trader.  And other 
designs for other circumstances - it is the art of picking the ship for a 
specific area that allows some ship captains to become rich while others 
have to try and skip out.

Okay - thanks for your response, I guessed what the compensators were for,

This raises another issue - how much can the body take for an extended

I was under the assumption that a person could still function fairly
normally upto 10G, but would get exhausted quickly, and the human body can
take upto 25G\'s or so in short spurts.  Could be wrong.

are entitled to say what you want, and some of your points I DO agree with.

RANT MODE ON.


Right, I\'ve had enough... all you TMLers out there listen...



THERE IS NO TRAVELLER CANON!!!!

Classic Traveller was simple in concept, technology existed but was not
described (until striker). 
There was no internal consistency, one supplement or module would
contradict another.
Also, in the seventies and early eighties we were quite happy to accept the
thought of anti-grav propulsion and fusion drives without really looking to
closely (waddya mean those drive will turn every atmosphere in the Imperium
into radioactive gas?).

Megatraveller incorporated "striker", poorly at that, but at least you tell
what happened when you shot at ships with hand weapons.
When GDW formalised what the technology was about, a lot of people
complained because it didn\'t fit in with what they thought (I wonder if
they called it canon back then?). 
Remember COACC, I started ripping out grav thrusters from TL15 starships
and putting in TL9 fusion rockets (which at that stage were not
radioactive), because they used less powerplant power, and I could get
better thrust and agility, and more cargo space. Well, that didn\'t fit with
canon, did it, big mistake there.

TNE tried to resolve some of the problems of MT, in my opinion FFS tried to
make everything cosistent, and, unfortunately, very bloody complicated. Oh,
and by the way, fusion rockets are radioactive, so that\'s why we don\'t use
them, but we\'ve got these psuedo-fusion things called HePlaR, which make a
mess with canon, but make more sense... well sort of.... just don\'t use
them as weapons.

And now with T4, we get the internal consistency of classic (not) with the
complication of FFS (and a real botchy job besides, lower quality on
average than GDW at it\'s worst).

OK, I\'m sick of hearing what is canon and what isn\'t. Perhaps we should try
to define what canon is... is it classic? Great, I\'ll just start designing
my jump torpedoes. Is it Megatrav? Fine, I always liked fusion drives. Is
it TNE, great, I have FFS, and most of the errata, and quite a few
spreadsheets, and a few weeks to spare.

Stop wining about what is and is not canon. There isn\'t any, not in any of
the traveller game systems. The rules we have now are what canon is now.
When T5 comes out, canon will change again, and again, and again. And the
plave it will be noticed most is in space combat, because that is the most
technologically intensive area in traveller. It has to change... we now
know more.. let it change, rather than sticking to our staw warsian
concepts. (Oh damn, I really love the idea of dogfighting, can\'t we just
reduce the range of all weapons to accomodate this?)

Rant mode off.


Ah, doctor TML, I feel so much better now, I assume you will charge your
usual fee.


OK, sorry all.

    'body' => 'Hi all,  I have been doing some thinking (and reading) recently (WARNING! 
WARNING! Thinking is dangerous!).  Before I continue, I am NOT a
physicist or even a scientist.  My interest in science is from a purely
socilogical and philosophical point, so they maybe errors in my logic.

Have you ever noticed that most sci-fi falls into two categories when it
comes to Hyperspace.

You have the Traveller/StarTrek/StarWars/Asimov concept of "jumping" or
warping.  No possible technical explaination can be made, we just assume
that in a distant future our descendents will figure out how to get to
other systems without taking to long.

The flip side is the Gate technology which is prevalent in things like
Babylon5 and many sci-fi computer games (Elite comes to mind).  Where
there is a definite point of entry and exit through a Gate which warps
time and space usually by the use of a wormhole of some type. 

So I decided to do some research into the area, to see if any physicist(s)
have ever thought about the problem, and thank goodness they have.

The only way (we know of) that we could *conceivably* travel to lets say
Vega (26ly) or Alpha Centauri (7ly?) is to a) build a ship that goes VERY
fast, maybe even approaches the speed of light which physically travels
through space from point a to poinnt b.  The problem with this is that if
we were to setup colonies let\'s say on Vega, it would take a round trip of
52ly to get information back and fourth from Vega.  The further the
colonies are away from Earth, the longer it takes for information to get
back, which basically means all the Colonies would be independent and
dependent on themselves, because it would take to long to get help or
supplys to and from any colony.  We do not have the technology as of yet
to build such a ship, but its possible that in the future we could build
such a ship.  This sort of universe is unworkable on a galactic sense, no
Imperium could exists for instance.  This approach is used by Arthur C.
Clarke in books like 3001.

The other approach is the use of Wormholes (sort of the Jump Gate
Technology).  As far as I know, Wormholes have been (mathematically)
proven to exists.  The problem with wormholes is that there tiny and
unstable, and they exist for only momments of life, much shorter then it
would be possible to travel through them.  So, would it be to great a
stretch of the imagination to believe that by th 52nd century Humananity
has gotten to the point where they can locate, and force open these
wormholes practically wherever they wish?

For those who do not know, a wormhole allows you to travel from any point
in the universe to any other point in the universe via a short (a few
kilometer length) tunnel in space.  The tunnel exists in hyperspace.  Its
difficult to explain how it actually works without diagrams, so I wont
try.

The debate about how we would do this is a completely different topic, I
am only interested to see what the minds on the list say about this system 
replacing the current Jump system.  I would really like to hear
from anyone who has done research into Black Holes and the like.

My only beef is that Traveller is such a cool game because, where
possible, its scientifically accurate.  For a universe like Travller to
exist, humans have to be able to travel between systems quickly.  The
current system is workable, but does not agree with our current body of
knowledge on the subject.  Wormholes/Jump Gates seem to be a workable
alternative to the current Jump system.

This all makes great sense, and the approach to the \'problem\' you take is
really interesting.  And pretty credible, in some respects -- for example,
I know that *adult* women who take testosterone (female-to-male
transsexuals, I\'m talking here) usually have pretty dramatic growth of the
clitoris -- I\'ve seen ~5 cm on one FTM after less than a year of hormone
treatments.  We\'re pretty plastic critters, even with TL6 (?) medicine.

Prehensile, now, well... <G>

Hm, interesting... I do like it.  With ovum-donation being dependent on
having a functional ovipositor-thingy, though, seems you could still get
some sort of \'castration fear\' complex.

So, do you think that in this case, the Sayat would have a masturbation
taboo as well, or just a taboo on knocking yourself up?  God, I love
science fiction!

Basically, though, for my own use, I\'m still going to go with the Sayat as
written, and their \'inadequate\' genetic engineering.  Anyone else who wants
to use them in a game or campaign setting is, of course, welcome to do as
you please -- it\'s not what I\'d consider a really major part of the
background.  The point is just that they\'re monosexual, is all -- and
unless you\'re running a fairly adult-themed game, the exact genital
morphology isn\'t likely to be relevant.

I got the impression from the Droyne suppliment that Grandfather wanted
helpers, Droyne were to brain dead to be of any real use, so he searched
for others.  He found humans, he tried using them, but found that they
were to willful, so he let them be.  He then decided to create his own
race, so made the Vargr.  They were to unfocused to be helpful.  It was at
this point he created 20 Grand children to help him, all of Droyne descent
and sharing his genes (he was their father).

Why he transplanted humans everywhere I cant say.  I get the impression
that after his dabbling with human/vargr assistents he just let them be.
I also get the impression that the only other sentinent life he found were
*humans* from *Earth*.  He never used Aslan, or Hivers, nor is there an
indication he knew of them, which implies that Humanity is also the oldest
race in the Galaxy after the Droyne.

I have been doing this all along. I don\'t particulary like the 
reactionless thrusterplates (doesn\'t give me the science fiction

I would think that a ships fuel tank is mad up of many smaller units,
something I think is consistent with the rules where a fuel hit cost
a loss of a percentage of the stored fuel. (combat rules). I see
both the HEPlaR and Jump drives as draining fuel over time, although
JD draines it much faster. When it comes to HEPlaR burning impure 
fuel I would think that the fuel consumption goes up as those the 
strain on the drive, causing a higher chance for a drive failure.

The largest problem with the JD and HEPlaR drives as it stands
now is the 10% of the volume for jump. A J3 drive would take 
up 30% of hull volume, which really makes HEPlaR shipsvery difficult
to build. Everything becomes a tradeoff.

Though it makes a lot more sense to not try and calculate the cost
every time when one is spending less than a dollar.  When you are
spending hundreds to thousands of credits the anology doesn\'t hold

This could be the current jump system.  By TL 9, someone figures out how to create a 
tunnel in space.  The tunnel is always about the same length -- the distance that the 
ship goes in about one week.  The tunnel isn\'t in our space; it\'s in jump space.  As 
technological capability increases, the distances bridged by the artificial wormhole 
increase up to 6 parsecs.  Someone else will have to do the math that tells us that 
jumps above 6 are theoretically impossible; then someone else will have to find the 
citation to Imperial research stations devoted to research into jumps greater than 6.

The Coyns were presented way way way after the Ancients ceased to be the
Ancients, and Grandfather moved on to his pocket Universe.  As I said it

	The "tau factor" is used for both time and length contraction, and mass
increase, and is equal to (1-v^2/c^2). So in your case, the factor is
0.75==>750 years would have passed.
	This is, of course, an oversimplification of all the relativistic mumbo

a heretic.

So what your saying is that for every 1000 Earth years I travel at 50% the
speed of light, 750 years pass on the ship.  Correct?  This does not sound
right - but hey, I aint a Physicist either, nor am i a Heretic.

	Well, now I shall call upon the Grand Inquisitor to force you to recant 
your heresies. May Strephon have mercy on your soul.

	But seriously, SURE there is a Traveller canon. Look, I have a whole pile 
of CT books and modules lying around. And you know what, I still get a hell 
of a lot of use out of \'em. And, IG and MM willing, I will still be able to 
use them for a long time to come.

	You pointed out some of the minor inconsistencies in the various past 
books and editions of Traveller. Fair enough - they do exist. But that sure 
isn\'t enough for me to through out the baby with the bath water.

	Since we\'re using the religious term "canon", lets look at the Christian 
canon -  the Holy Bible. Now, even as a Christian I can freely admit there 
are some contradictions between the various books and the various gospels. 
But does that mean that the Bible is meaningless? No!

	(BTW, the last thing I want to do is start any kind of religious discus  
sion on the TML. The only thing more controversial than politics (which is 
pretty darn controversial, as I recently found out here) is religion).

	So I shall freely identify myself, not as a heretic, but as a True 
Believer in the Traveller Orthodoxy. I implore IG to be as consistent as 
reasonably possible with previously published material. Don\'t invalidate my 
CT books while I\'m playing T4!

	And to all you heretics out there, who seem willing to throw out the canon 
at a moment\'s notice - after throwing out so much, at what  point are you 
no longer playing Traveller?

	Ahhh - good point. The reason is because the coyns were introduced into 
Droyne culture (by Grandfather) LONG AFTER the ancient period - something 
like -50,000.

The trick is to use some relays in low orbit. That\'s how all the
outfits planning to offer "satellite cellular" plan to do it. 50 to 100
satellites in orbits at 100 miles or less. You can get by with fewer
relays if the mobile units are restricted to a small area on the
surface. The closer to the equator, the fewer units you need.

A size A world only has a surface gravity of 1.25 g. A size 9 has
1.125. All others are 1 g or less. Now if you start getting fancy with
the advanced rules then things get a bit different. But with the basic
rules, the problem affects 3/36 (1/12th) of the planets, and can be
overcome there with orbital stations or the like.

Thats not the way FTL is described in any Traveller manual.  Traveller
uses the "warping hyperspace field" and the "folding paper" idea, which is
different from the Wormhole concept.  Thats why a few weeks ago a asked
for a Traveller definition of how FTL (Jump) work\'s to make sure I was
not wasting my time and that in fact Traveller does use Wormhole based
FTL as opposed to field based FTL.

Thanks for the comments though.

Interesting info -- thanks for sharing it with us/me.  I am in a state of
deprivation of the Droyne module for the time being.

Aside:  Wouldn\'t the Vargr and the \'modified\' minor races of humaniti be
\'older races\' than Solomani humans?  I mean, their distinguishing
biological traits were set 300,000-odd years ago, whereas Homo sapiens
sapiens is pretty modern (~30-50,000 y.a.?)  I dunno... sort of hard to
judge absolute "age" of species in any case.

Main next cool question:  How come Grandfather DIDN\'T have anything to do
with the Aslan, Hiver, or K\'kree?  I can\'t think of any mention whatsoever
of his fooling around with them, or even of Ancient artifacts in their

so silent on the whole matter?

The illustrations on how they look are so ugly as nobody in their right

Hyperspace in B5 is traversed with normal reaction engines but due to
babble-this-handwave-that hard to navigate. Terrans first got jumpgates
from another race and used their own sublight ships to cruise around but
later they learned how to make their own gates and also gated ships; ships
which carry thir gate with them a la Traveller. The RPG BTW is pretty good
but lack enough material to actually play. Item list consists of guns and
comm units etc but the referee can pick stuff up from the series. Did you

  Oh, you said _canon_ - sorry about that.

  Seriously, there are some things that are canon in Traveller.  A few are
technological - things like the one week (plus or minus a little bit) jump
duration and anti-gravity.  Take those out and you are not playing
Traveller (or at least not a recognizable form of the game).  The most
important form of Traveller canon, however, is the historical background,
and that\'s something that has evolved over time.  The reason I enjoy the
game so much is not for the hardware - although I think meson guns are
cool, any SF game can provide a mechanism for killing other player
characters.  The reason I play is for the software, the historical
material.  To me that is what gives the game its feel, and the piddling
little details of ship design and the like are immaterial.

It is not guaranteed in the case of any individual jump but it it is
_statistically_ certain.

In regions of average stellar density a jump 1 ship will probaly be able
to reach 3 planets, a jump 2 ship 9 planets, and a jump 3 ship 18
planets.  Different cargos will sell better at different planets. (see
the cargo price modifiers table from most versions of traveller).  The
more planets you can reach the more positive price modifiers you can
take advantage of. It is basic math to determine this.  Suppose that the
cargo you are selling has the trade code As-B (it comes from a TL 11
asteroid belt) it will sell for a base price of +1000 credits a ton at
another As,  a In, Na, Ri, or Va.  You want to take it to a planet with
as many of thse codes as you can find as these positive price modifiers
are all cumulative.  The more planets you have to choose from the better
your ods of racking up these positive price modifiers.

It may very well be the case that the _designers_ of the ship did have a
certain trading circumstance in mind for their ship, however the owners
& operators of the ship won\'t care about what it was intended to be used
for they will care what they can make the most money doing.  If the
designers did their job right & understand economics this will be very
similar however.

They may be somewhat more likely to fail but on the other hand they may
be more likely to be self sufficient.

Yes it should, but it does not & that is the system we are dealing
with.  The rules were presumably made for ease of play, they don\'t make
economic sense, & I have always assumed they were Imperial Law because
nothing else could explain them. If I were running a TNE non regency
campaign I would not use them.

However, this isn\'t strictly true.  The relative permittivity eta_r
of a material (which is related to its refractive index n) is found 
to vary with the frequency of EM radiation.  For non-magnetic
insulators, eta_r = n^2, but both change with frequency.

This is of course how prisms work: the speed of different coloured 
light (different frequencies) in the same medium is different.

So the answer to the original poster\'s question is "yes".  Or more 
strictly, "vice versa" since it\'s the refractive index of the 
material which determines the speed of light...

And of course there are non-linear optical materials which react to 
light etc. in interesting ways.  Even a lump of crystal can be used
to frequency-double red laser light to green -- tho\' it has to be the 
right sort of crystal (non-centrosymmetric) and cut properly.

Don\'t get me started...

all fuel is used for any jump.  However, the questioner\'s variant 
system was thought to be sensible:

Any jump uses the appropriate fuel volume.  For example, any jump-1 
uses 10% of the ship\'s volume in fuel, jump-2 uses 15%, etc..  Hence
a jump-3 ship is not capable of 3 parsecs of jump, it\'s capable of 
one jump-3, one jump-2  or two jump-1.

This was the system I\'d independently evolved, which I though made a 
decent balance between "jump drives are tuned to work at one fuel 
consumption only" and "shorter jumps require less fuel".

Welcome, I think the Ancients are a cool idea, if I ever wrote a book or

I see what your saying, but this makes no sense.  Terra is the homeworld
of all Humaniti as well as the Vargr.  So either our current primitive

Can\'t say.  Being a Solomani I would have to say that they became
sentinent AFTER the Cataclyism or he did know about them, but Humans are so
far superrior to your average Hive/Aslan etc that he decided to try and 
use Humans.  Which reinforces the Solomani Cause, and just adds weight to
the belief that Humans, in particular those from Earth, should rule the
Galaxy!

Long Live the Cause!
Long Live the Solomani!

One of these days, I gotta look up "canon" in the dictionary.

Yes. There is a certain amount of conflict with respect to starship
maneuver drives, yes. CT had no options. MT had no options, well, yeah,
until COACC and Hard Times came out (both described various types
of reaction drives). TNE changed things rather seriously.

There is, however, a written history of space and humaniti, which
is accepted in all version of Traveller. The three Imperia, the seven
major races, the three "major" branches of humaniti, the various "minor"
races. the (rough) layout of space, etc. 

While almost all Trav sources in CT/MT/T4 have ships that use thruster plates,
it certainly doesn\'t say anywhere that you _can\'t_ have other types
of ships. The only "canonical" kind of statement I would make about
ship drives is that "the most common type of maneuver drive is the
thruster plate". Now, if you wanted to change that, ok, big deal. it
doesn\'t really affect things much.

Now, when you go and say "the maximum TL reached by the Rule of Man
was TL 15", this, uh, kind of buggers things up. It really plays
with the written, descriptive history of the Imperium. It would be
like a modern historian saying "Yeah, the Romans had a large assortment
of small firearms. No big deal."

My complaint about "canon" was really pretty much about meson guns in
particular, which operated in the same basic manner in CT, MT and TNE.
There\'s also a number of written descriptions of their "operating principles"
which describe how they work and that they\'re very effective. T4 has
gone and basically thrown that all out - in that one category. I consider
this effective castration of meson guns (who was talking about Freud before?)
to be a lot more severe than swapping types of m-drives around. If 
T4 is really supposed to be set in the same universe as CT, MT and TNE,
than the rules it describes are wrong, because the universe didn\'t work
that way yesterday. (Some of the rules, not all of them).

Don\'t invalidate my CT, MT and TNE books by allowing 200 dTon
merchants to be completely immune from meson guns.

Yes, if you\'re playing with the GURPS system and have made a number of 
"minor history revisions", you\'re playing a Traveller-inspired game,
not Traveller. Not that there\'s anything wrong with that - just don\'t
tell me that I can\'t say that there\'s a Traveller "canon". If you don\'t
like using said canon, fine, but don\'t tell me that it doesn\'t exist.

	Droynes (and Chirpers) have ability to develop mentally and

    'body' => 'I think there needs to be some MAJOR rethinking regarding the surface area
requirements of the external grapples.  Take this example from QSDS...


A 10 ton External Grapple requires 441 sq meters...

The 10-ton vessel has a length (as a sphere) of 7 meters.  Now, let\'s add a
meter and a half to each side of the grapple to give room for any extra
fittings, hoses, or other items that might need to be there.  Now we hav 10
meters.  Allowing for a square attachment area, that is 100 square meters.
What is QSDS doing with the additional 341 sq. meters??????

FFS is slightly more humane about it.  The surface area required is the
final length cubed.  For the sphere above it is fine (49 sq meters), but
let\'s assume we want a needle hull form.  The 7 meter length becomes 21
meters, and the FFS required surface area is...  441 sq. meters.

Well, we can see where QSDS came up with the 441, but consider for a moment
that the dimensions of the hull (assuming most of the area is covered like
in the sphere under FFS), the hull is 21m by 21m.  THIS IS LUDICRIOUS!!!

I have a solution. :)

For hulls under 100 Sdt (which is what we are really talking about), the
surface area required is 1.2 times the "footprint" of the carried craft.
The "footprint" of the carried craft, then, is the volume divided by 3.5m.
This gives a result of square meters.  The 3.5 meters is used to assume that
the carried craft is a single "deck."  Take the height away and all you have
is length and width which is what attaches to the hull of the "Mother Ship."
The 1.2 multiplier allows for some space around the craft.  Even 2 times the
"footprint" would be an improvement over what we have now.

I think this is much more fair than the previous method.  Consider...

        The Llyrnians are a Low-G race. Their fighting ability is superior
to that of humans in Low and zero-G, precisely because they are Low-G
adapted. The Geonee are High-G adapted, so, when artificial gravity fails on
a starship, their troops are not very good... They are better than the
Geonee on starships, and on small planets. E.g., Kiimda, the conquered
colony of Shiwonee, which is size 1.

>digging prowess might assist in that, of course, but you don\'t specify how

        Good insight. They have very strong, hard *hands* that can be
considered claws for fighting. For digging, these "claws" can vibrate to
make the soil loose... anyway, only the more primitive Llyrnians dug without
tools.

>But I\'d like to know how these guys get such a studly reputation.... :-)

        That\'s for the detailed draft. This one was a summary ;-)
        Llyrnians fight mostly with short blade weapons, but also throw
things at short distance. They have no idea of how to throw a spear in a
parabola-like trajectory to hit a running foe, but they know a lot about
throwing a knife in a fairly linear trajectory against some advancing enemy
in a narrow corridor)
        Btw, Llyrnian vacc suits are really special... the gloves are of
strong materials, and fit to the hands/claws very tightly, so that the
Llyrnian marines can still use them as weapons. And, if a hand/claw breaks
your suit and starts to vibrate, forget about patches and say goodbye... a
trained Llyrnian *may* even break a battle dress integrity with a very lucky
punch.

        Once upon a time, a group of Vilani marines boarded a Geonee ship.
Lights went off, atmosphere disappeared, and artificial gravity failed.
Suddenly, a bunch of demons surrounded them, having apparently no problem
with the darkness, moving real fast while the marines tried to keep control
of themselves in zero-G... A demon *touched* one marine, and his vacc suit
opened. Scratch one marine. Another demon attacked a marine with a short
blade, outmaneuvering him. The marines opened fire, but all was chaos, and
they were only able to hurt themselves and lose control because of the
recoil of the weapons. One marine was able to cut the vacc suit of a demon,
but it seemed not to cause the demon any problem. Of the original twelve
marines, only two made it out of the ship. And the story spread fast...
        When a hundred demons attacked a Vilani colony on a gas giant moon
two months later, the legend was complete.

        Precisely that\'s the point. A *lot* more caves than in Earth are
possible.

(Snip)
        I wasn\'t thinking in such processes, but it\'s a good idea. Llyrn\'s
aytmosphere is Very Thin, but untainted. Life originated in geothermal
energy sources, but evolved towards oxygen-consumption (that\'s one of the
current theories on the origin of life on Earth, although not a popular
one), although more as an energetic complement than as a fundamental process
(i.e. Llyrnians can actually "hold their breaths" for a long time...) As for
sulfur, it is not breathed, but *eaten* in the diet, as most inferior life
forms on Llyrn use only sulfur, not oxygen.
        More details will follow. Any chemist in the list could tell me how
a mixed Oxygen/Sulfur consumption process may work?

        Yes, vision is definitively not their primary sense.

        Maybe unlikely, but I think that the sonar and hearing senses are
feasible, and they could have evolved in a tunnel/cave environment, where,
although sound may not be very well transmitted, there would be all kind of
echoes. As for smelling, well, *if* they are able to smell a faint trace of
something in a very thin atmosphere, after a little training they would be
able of smelling *everything* in a standard atmosphere.
        The "sensing vibrations" bit is also a good idea. But, once you
sense vibrations in the rock and soil, it could be easy to evolve to
"sensing vibrations" in the (very thin) atmosphere, and that\'s hearing...
        Maybe it could be stated as a "General Vibration Sense", which
allows them sensing vibrations in soil and rocks (it first evolved for
this), hearing, and sonar.

        Ooooops! Typo! I meant "...the one thousand MILLIONS figure..."

        Yep. More detail will follow. The trilateral symmetry allows some
weird possibilities. In principle, the three should have to be together at
the same tine. The Llyrnians bear live youngsters.

Description:

The Anderson class exploratory trader is a 2000 displacement ton
vessel, intended for use in discovering trade goods and markets in
unfamiliar space.  Its most unusual features are a docking bay for a
100-ton ship, intended for a 100-ton courier but usable by shuttles,
and its array of collapsible tanks.  One set of 200 Td tanks in the
hangar may be used freely, though this restricts work on craft above
50 Td displacement (add one level of difficulty to task).  If the
hangar is empty and gear stowed - which takes 12 person-hours - the
second set of 200 Td tanks may be filled.  Standard doctrine also has
every small craft fitted with collapsible fuel tanks in their cargo
hold, in order to jump to safety in the case of misjump.

It is expected that the cargo hold will contain spare parts,
consumables and trade goods.  As the voyage progresses, these will be
replaced by new trade items.  Six low berths allow the transport of
animal specimens or reserve crewmembers.

A 1G HEPlaR drive is fitted as backup to the main thrusters, or for
emergency acceleration.  The powerplants are sufficient to power all
components simultaneously, although only three 500 MW units are
required for normal operation (no HEPlaR).

Crew assignments vary, with troops sometimes replaced by scientific
staff or assigned to small craft.  The 12 auxilliary craft crew are
four mechanics and eight crew members; in practice, they represent
relief personnel for the main crew, and may not be assigned to one
craft only.

The price of this ship does not include the J3, 2G courier ship at
MCr 50.6, or any small craft.  Common small craft selections are
	cutter, spare module and launch
        slow pinnace, ship\'s boat, gig
	slow pinnace, heavy fighter, gig
although the commercial availability of fighters is extremely low.

squabbling over the crumbs you\'ve left them.  You need Imperial
Shipping\'s Anderson class Exploratory Trader, or you need a new job.
Because if your competitors buy and you don\'t, pretty soon you\'ll
need one.

Let\'s be honest.  It doesn\'t take an Anderson to jump three parsecs
in a week.  Wilderness refuelling is pretty common.  Most ships carry
a small craft or two.  So what makes our ship so special?  The clean
lines of a 99m airframe hull?

How about the way it\'s built around a massive 400 Td hangar?  (It\'s
nearly the size of some of our competitors\' ships.)

A hangar that houses a very special scoutship.  We can\'t confirm
that it\'s related to the latest Navy courier.  Nor can we deny it. 
This lightly-armed ship can carry enough fuel for two 3-parsec jumps,
using a collapsible fuel tank to maintain cargo capacity.  When your
trade information won\'t wait, you don\'t have to abandon your
expensive mission -- just send the Type S3 courier.

A hangar big enough for shuttles to pour trade goods into the ample
100 Td cargo bay.  Just the thing when you\'re receiving goods from
civilisations that don\'t have Fusion Plus(TM) -- yet!

A hangar which can be used as fuel storage, thanks to innovative use
of collapsible tanks.  (We\'ve put them in the cargo bay, too.)

We\'re nearly as pleased with our hangar as you\'ll be.  Especially
when you need the space for repairs.  Or fuel.  Or spares.  Or an
end-of-tour celebration.

Of course, we supply fittings for a number of other small craft.
However, we believe you\'re the best judge of your trading needs, so
we don\'t force you to take some standard package of craft.  Our
advisers are always ready to help you choose, however, so you\'ve
still got all the power of Imperial Shipping\'s experience behind you.

You\'ve also got the power of our milspec laser battery, in case of
trouble.  Plus four secondary turrets.  Four sandcasters.  A nuclear
damper, in case your potential trading partners haven\'t heard about
the Imperial ban.  A heavily-armoured hull.  Even a meson screen. 
(Recent medical research indicates it reduces radiation exposure for
deep space crews like yours.)  And with our Navy-issue sensor gear,
you\'ll see trouble coming before it sees you.

If you need to run, you\'ve got a HEPlaR drive to boost you away from
trouble.  And of course, two separate main drives means never having
to say "sundive".  Especially when the Anderson has five main 500 MW
powerplants, runs on two, and cruises on three.  Of course, our fuel
purification plant keeps everything clean, but accidents -- and
worse -- can happen.  That\'s why we\'ve included engineering and
vehicle shops, to help your engineers keep things running smoothly.

Keeping your crew running smoothly is as important as maintaining
your drives, so we\'ve included plenty of common space for recreation,
as well as individual staterooms for every crewmember.  We\'ve left
you space for a security detachment, plus a couple of high
passengers.  Or maybe you want a couple of top scientists to work in
the on-board analysis lab? Again, it\'s your choice, because trading
is your business.  Designing quality starships is ours.

And because of our key role in establishing standard, modular
starship components throughout the Imperium, we\'re cheaper than you\'d
think. MCr 727 buys you more quality than the competition can stand. 
They know that too.  Buy first.  Buy now.  Buy Anderson, from
Imperial Shipyards.

There\'s only one feature of the Anderson we hope you won\'t use: the
emergency low berths.  Still, at least you won\'t be there for the
rest of your life, like on most ships.  But then, they don\'t carry a
scoutship capable of two 3-parsec jumps.  Just high insurance 
premiums.

Design notes:

I had to extrapolate a bit to get the 400 ton hangar, so maybe I
should add MCr 0.3 to the final (discounted) price for that.  The use
of collapsible tanks in the hangar is a bit arguable, too, though at
least 200 tons should certainly be possible.  Other than that,
everything is standard QSDS.

I\'ve gone for a real mix of features, on the basis that the ship
will be an explorer rather than a trader.  The emphasis is therefore
on sample goods and knowledge, coupled with sustainability, rather
than traditional trade performance.  This explains the MCr 7.3 per
cargo ton cost (although that doesn\'t allow for cargo aboard the
small craft).  The lab is symptomatic of this approach.

The scoutship is key to this design, so I give details below.  It\'s
not a Navy Courier (which exists as an SSDS design with EMM and
better sensors, etc.) but has identical performance.  The ability to
send data back to a parent company is invaluable to exploratory
trade.

I can\'t wait to tell a group of PCs "OK, you\'re crew of the
exploratory trader _Harrison_, which has just misjumped badly. 
There\'s a single scoutship in which to get help, and you\'ve been
selected to fly it. Good luck."

How about someone requesting admission for worlds which would prefer not to

	This is pure conjecture, but from a game design perspective I think it was 
because Marc Miller et al didn\'t want the Ancients to be behind EVERYTHING, 
just most things. I mean I\'m sure its completely possible for at least a 
few species to evolve and develop jump drive without Yaskoydray\'s 
influence.

	Now the real questions is - the Coynes were introduced into Droyne society 
something like ~-50,000. This was well after the Ancient period, but long 
before the Aslan, Hivers or K\'kree developed jump drive. What gives?

	Hey, I\'m agreeing with you. I really haven\'t followed the meson gun

	Exactly. And of course, I would never presume to tell someone how they can

	I don\'t think so. Ancient=Droyne, Droyne=Ancient. As far as I can tell, 
the only differences are cultural, not any real physiological differences.

The Ancients simply didn\'t need the mystic mumbo-jumbo to caste. But the 
culturally degraded modern-day Droyne do.

	I sincerely doubt it. The extreme reverence and sacredness of the Droyne 
casting ritual would probably preclude any research in that area. At least 
by the Droyne.

	Now how about a human psionic researcher, who has to deal not only his own 
academic peers, but the cultural prejudices of his Droyne test subjects?

It was both a generator and a space-plasma experiment; rather than running
a complete current-carrying loop, they only ran one wire to the tethered 
satellite - the return current path was through the ionized plasma in 
that region of near-earth space, which is still relatively thick.

Actually you need normalspace AND jumpspace engines, the actual jumpspace 
engines are small enough to fit in a small ship. But the engines which 
actually break into hyperspace (i.e. the gates) are too big to fit on 
small ships which is why they have to use the gates.
Of course Vorlons and Shadows throw two fingers to this and do whatever 
they want. Minbari ships also have funky artificial gravity and 
magnetic/gravitation drive with extra wizz.

Apparently Titan books have got the rights to publish the book in the uk 
and will do so when they get things sorted out, end of june/july was one 
date I read.
Anyway you\'ve got enough with the series to do the whole thing with 
traveller why bother getting another sci-fi game (:-))))).
P.S. has anyone tried to hack around with FF&S to produce B5 ships, all 
you need to do is change the drive system, weapons, communication 
systems, tech level artificial grvaity discovered at....Actually this 
does sound like quite a bit of work but the game and tell us if its any 
good.

Actually you need normalspace AND jumpspace engines, the actual jumpspace 
engines are small enough to fit in a small ship. But the engines which 
actually break into hyperspace (i.e. the gates) are too big to fit on 
small ships which is why they have to use the gates.
Of course Vorlons and Shadows throw two fingers to this and do whatever 
they want. Minbari ships also have funky artificial gravity and 
magnetic/gravitation drive with extra wizz.

Apparently Titan books have got the rights to publish the book in the uk 
and will do so when they get things sorted out, end of june/july was one 
date I read.
Anyway you\'ve got enough with the series to do the whole thing with 
traveller why bother getting another sci-fi game (:-))))).
P.S. has anyone tried to hack around with FF&S to produce B5 ships, all 
you need to do is change the drive system, weapons, communication 
systems, tech level artificial grvaity discovered at....Actually this 
does sound like quite a bit of work but the game and tell us if its any 
good.

I think it changed for MT.. I\'d have to go and read my old rules to check
this. However, if you read the CT adventure Twilight\'s Peak, one of the
reasons that the Empress Nicholle (the player\'s A2 Far Trader with
knackered J Drives) is not very economic is that it uses a full tank of J
fuel to do a Jump 1. Personally, I\'ve always stuck with varying J-Fuel use.
It allows nice things like hit and run raiding in High Guard.

   Sure.  To find the tau factor, the factor by which time is dialated,
   take the cosine of the arcsine of (v/c), where v is your speed, and c
   is the speed of light.

   tau = cos(asin(v/c))

   No.  You\'re close though.  Tau = SQRT(1 - (v/c)^2) is the equivalent
   of the equation I just posted above.  You had forgotten the square root.

   Not quite right; take the square root of 0.75, or 0.87, which means
   that 870 years pass on board the ship.

Have you tried telling Greg Porter where he went wrong?  I do not have the
books handy, so I could not quote chapter and verse, but since he is the
source of both of these statements, we might want to stop it at the source.
 He can be reached, and is quite open to suggestions, at btrc@aol.com.

We also might want to start work on a TML Traveller Writer\'s Guide, that
covers the basic ideas of the system.  For example, the canonical list of
important dates, the size of the empire in worlds at various times, major
contacts, major technologies, what the average tech level is, and so on.  I
would shoot for 5-10 terse pages, and hope that is sufficient.

I know what you mean about the lack of consistency, though.

I recently started work on ISDS, the idiot simple ship design system, that
should let one design a reasonable ship in 10-15 minutes with no prior
experience, by simply doing as much as possible in terms of hull fractions,
and starting with the desired cargo or weapons loadout, and working
backwards.  I was just terribly frustrated when I tried to figure out which
worlds had working starports and could build ships.  We need those economic
rules.

Hopefully, I will get my subsector mapper and new world generation rules
done soon, so that I have at least one finished project.  (I am just
stating outright that a certain minimum population is needed for a given
tech level, and that you may add in any world within a certain jump
distance.  I am also just deleting any world with less than 4 million
people, unless it is a recent colony, as that is not terribly viable over
the long term.

I see what you are talking about, but I would like a somewhat different
approach. Why don\'t we say that in order for a ship to grapple another
ship surface area equal to say 40% of the grappled ships volume in
square meters must be used inorder to properly hold the ship.

This would give 
       10 Std           56 sq.m
       20 Std          112 sq.m
       30 Std          168 sq.m
      100 Std          560 sq.m
      600 Std         3360 sq.m 

I would then also allow for the surface requirement (at least for
two vessels both above the 100Std ton limit) to be distributed with
a 70 to 30 percent between the two vessels. This means that a 
5000Std vessel grappling a 600Std vessels would have a grapple 
surface of 2352sq.meters while the 600Std vessel must have a 
1008sq meter of grapple surface.

I really don\'t see why a ship grappling another ship has to grapple on to
such large areas. All you need is some strong cables, hook them on the
ship and pull it onto a appropriate area. Why do the grappled ship have to
lie with its belly toward the mother ship?

I got the system fast enough to keep VIRUS from imprinting itself on the

The problem here is that we have two branches of Traveller canon.. the
setting and the rules.  The rules have been twisted so many times its
ceased to be funny.  Even not counting the 4.5 editions of the game we\'ve
gone through, minor changes in the game itself have caused more headaches
as players and referees tried to keep up with the changing realities around
them.

Can your ship\'s drive be used as a weapon?  No (CT) Yes (HG 1st ed) No (HG
2nd ed) Maybe (everything after)

My personal favorite remains MegaTraveller, simply because I found that to
be the best total package for the type of games that I run.

Then there is the setting canon.  Traveller has a history as richly
detailed as any in gaming, with the exception of RuneQuests Glorantha.
There was a time in my life when I could name more Emperors than Presidents
(unfortunantly, that period was High School, where my encyclopedic
knowledge of the Third Imperium was sadly undervalued.)

I *like* the Traveller backround.  I object to poorly thought out changes
to it, such as the Rule of Man reaching TL 15.  

Now to my shocking admission:  I\'m running Traveller using Greg Porter\'s
excellent CORPS rules.  The campaign is going to be a CT fanatic\'s wet
dream: crewing a Free Trader in 1105, in the Spinward Marches.  I\'m going
to use Traveller rules for spacecraft and worlds, some variant of the trade
rules, but the characters and action will not be strictly Traveller.

Does this make me a heretic?  I\'m just sick and tired off waiting for a
playable system to come from IG, and even KBv2.0 doesn\'t make enough fixes
to make the game playable for me.

I\'m wondering how many of us actually play strictly canonical (rules and
backround) Traveller?  Many of us date back to when the Imperium was a
one-line throwaway comment in Book 4\'s introduction, we\'ve seen the growth
of the Imperium, and the rules.. does anybody think that the level of
detail is to great?  How about rules, what percentage of your game
mechanics are home brewed?

Just some thoughts.. I\'d be interested in your comments

	No, I\'m afraid there is.  I just looked through Path of Tears, 
the Rebellion sourcebook, Milieu 0, and the Library Data books from the 
old set.
	Amazingly enough, I have found little to no game rules in any of 
these books.  This would, shockingly enough, imply that were printed for 
a different reason.  I propose that this purpose is none other than 
putting forth a unified future history ( although there are discrepancies 
, intentional or otherwise ( but then again, I have two British history 
books that dont agree with each other either )).  This is canonical 
material, else there would be no point in printing it ( other than making 
money :) ).
	If there is no canonical history and it can be changed at whim, 
someone needs to contact me with a refund check for these books which 
have no purpose. :)
	Simply put, T4 needs to stick with the accepted future history or 
get out of the future history business altogether.  I agree with the 
poster who stated that saying the 2I made it to TL 15, was akin to saying 
the Roman Empire had a few types of small arms.  This makes no sense.

In light of the recent discussions on the organization of the Imperial Army, I thought I would take the time to present how it works in my version of Traveller reality.

For purposes of examining the Army as a mature force, and since it\'s where my campaign is set, the example we will be looking at is the Lunion Subsector of the Spinward Marches in 1105.  To start at the top, we have:

ARMY SUPREME COMMAND (Capital/Core)

This is the highest command authority for the Imperial Army.  This command is concerned with the long range planning and defense of the entire Imperium.  This unit organizes all R&D, mass equipment upgrades, and changes in Army doctrine and regulations.  It has little say in the day-to-day managing of line units; in fact it controls only one unit directly: The Imperial Guard.

DOMAIN COMMAND: DENEB (Depot/Deneb)

Even though the Domain of Deneb does not have an archduke in 1105, the Army maintains a level of command for the purpose of strategic planning "behind the claw."  Officers assigned here have a better focus on the problems and threats facing their area of operations.

Deneb Command also oversees the allocation of Imperial funds to the Sector forces.  Many worlds in the Imperial Core do not bother with extensive military development, and pay into a general fund rather than raising units that are three years from the border in the first place.  The Supreme Command allocates this money as block grants to the domains, who use it to fund projects of local need.  Many times, this money is passed down the line with no strings attached.  This is generally the case in Deneb, due to the wildly varying threats the region faces.

Domain level commands control a small group of elite troops, rarely more than a division, who act as a "fire brigade" for the command.  Since this is traditionally the Marine mission, there is a great deal of friction over these unit\'s existence.

SPINWARD MARCHES HIGH COMMAND (Rhylanor/Rhylanor)

The sector high command is the highest level of command that directly commands regular Army units.  In a wartime situation, units leaving their home Subsector come under the control of the sector command for the duration of their transit.  Leaving this control only when the unit either returns home or is handed off to a local command for combat.  The sector command controls the reserves and logistics for the Army when it mobilizes.

The sector command also distributes funding to the Subsector Armies.  Since planning is done decades in advance, each Subsector force submits an annual update on its projected needs over the next ten years.  Budget allocations are made based on both these figures, and on the needs of the sector as a whole.

The sector command controls the strategic reserve for the sector.  This consists of all Army units out of their home Subsector and in transit, as well as all colonial forces (see below) committed to action.

LUNION ARMY HEADQUARTERS (Lunion/Lunion)

The Subsector Army is the heart of the Imperial defense.  Each Subsector crafts its force to meet its unique needs and threats.  Lunion\'s main threat is seen as the Sword Worlds Confederation.  Most of Lunion\'s planning is based around a series of scenarios concerning a SWC attack on the Spinward worlds of the Subsector.  Subsector command also gathers intelligence about enemy activities and intentions; passing these nuggets of information to Navy Intelligence in an attempt to paint a complete picture of what is happening beyond the Imperial border.

Subsector Headquarters is where the actual purchasing of equipment takes place.  Within guidelines from higher headquarters, each Subsector is pretty free to equip its forces as it likes.  This leads to some oddities, like Five Sister\'s small but potent Army, universally equipped with battledress and fusion weapons.  Lunion has steered a more predictable course; building fairly standard TL14-15 tank and infantry units.  As is true for most Spinward Marches commands, Lunion Army makes sure that all vehicles and personal armor are equipped with mind-shields in case of conflict with telepathic Zhodani troops.

Operationally, the Army HQ coordinates the actions of its forces, plus those assigned to it by higher command, in the defense of the Subsector.  If offensive operations are called for, Lunion forces may be seconded to the assault force at the Sector Command\'s discretion.

The current commander of the Lunion Army is General Oiwaeas, an Aslan from Strouden.  A 30-year veteran, Oiwaeas is a decorated veteran of the 4th Frontier War, as well as innumerable border incidents with the Sword Worlders.  Oiwaeas is much beloved by his troops as a fighting leader, and his sense of humor is legendary.  (During one incident, a Sword World commander insinuated that Oiwaeas need to go to the "cat box."  After learning from an aide what was meant by the insult, Oiwaeas made a point of dumping sand over the defeated SW officer\'s head, remarking "I understand this is the proper thing for a cat to do with its waste."  To this day his personal command vehicle is named CatBox.)

THE STROUDENESE ROYAL ARMY (Strouden/Lunion)

This is where the troops and tanks are found.  Strouden is a Hi-pop, Industrial world of the Lunion Subsector.  Its total population is 8.3x10^9; mostly human with a significant (6%) Aslan minority.  The planet is ruled by a constitutional monarchy.  The Grand Prince controls the various government agencies, who operate as a meritocracy.

Strouden\'s Planetary Defense Force has approx. 7 million soldiers active at any one time.  An additional 5 million can be found as reservists, home guards, and local militias.

10% of the Strouden Army is pledged to the Imperial Army.  These units receive TL14-15 equipment and training.  This amounts to 35 division sized units (25 Lift Infantry, 10 Grav Tank) and a smattering of specialist units (1 Rapid Interface Infantry Brigade, several battalion and smaller Civil Action, Intelligence, Heavy Engineer, etc.)

The remainder of the units are organized as the Royal Stroudenese Army.  This formidable force can field 12 Field Armies equipped to TL13 standard, along with 2 Corps equipped to TL14 (The King\'s Own Guards and The Landing Warders)

The local Imperial units and the RSA engage in regular wargames against one another.  The RSA maintains a training area staffed by troops who use Sword Worlds tactics and equipment for a realistic training environment; and many Imperial units, both Marine and Army have praised it for the realism of the exercises.

Although the Imperial element of Strouden\'s forces is answerable to the Subsector command, the local government always has the right to veto any off-world deployment.  This is a risky move, as it invites Imperial displeasure, and any world making such a stand would best be ready to present a very convincing case before the Moot.

The Imperial Army units on Strouden are fed, paid, clothed, and housed by the RSA.  The Imperium picks up the bill for the high tech equipment and training/deployment costs.  This benefits the Royal government greatly, since they get a resident force at little expense to themselves.

COLONIAL FORCES

In times of great peril, such as a major war, planetary forces may be volunteered for Imperial service.  Such forces are referred to as "Colonial Units," and are generally considered to be of a lesser quality than front-line troops.  Regardless, these troops can take a great deal of pressure of harried commanders by assuming garrison and security roles, freeing up units for the front lines.  Since these are not Imperial units, their equipment and training can vary wildly, making it hazardous to mix them with Imperial units.  During the 4th Frontier War, there was one recorded case of an Imperial Marine point-defense system firing on approaching colonials because their non-standard G-carriers were not in the fire control computer\'s memory.

  That Heavy Metal influence is easily traceable if you watched (and read)
the credits. A lot of the "look" of the movie was done by Moebius (sp?). It
shows strongly in the "cars" and on the Policemen, as well as Milla
Jovovich\'s initial, uh, clothing. In fact, if the comic book adaption (and
you know there will be one) is drawn by anyone other than Moebius I won\'t
bother buying it.

  Compared to what I\'ve seen of the other SF offerings coming this summer,
Fifth Element will be hard to beat.

 Another good place that people may keep an eye on, and where

 rec.games.frp.announce.  This is a moderated group, so there\'s

Thanks to those that sent me addresses of games stores in Manhattan - looks
like I\'ll be popping into The Complete Strategist ("Only for a minute,
dear, honest" ;-)).  On further investigation, there seems to be little
difference between prices here and in the US (unlike other books), but I\'ll
probably have a bigger selection than my local shops.

Emperor\'s Arsenal
- ----
Also, thanks for the comments on Emperor\'s Arsenal.  I appreciate you
spending the time to write even a few words.  I\'ve bought myself a copy,
and I agree that it\'s a very good product (I would say excellent if it was
$5 or so cheaper).  I can\'t help wishing that Greg Porter had been given
more of the T4 combat/technology stuff.  The essays and comments next to
each weapon were great (and the humour on p33, as someone else has pointed
out).  Also, the illustrations will be useful to give the players a visual
cue.

Campaign
- ----
I don\'t know if I\'ve been inspired by EA, or what, but I\'ve started writing
a T4 campaign.  I\'d appreciate any comments anyone might have.

It will be episodic in nature (we have lots of people who like to referee
different games, and it takes me a long time to come up with good ideas),
and fairly mission-based, at least initially.  I am assuming that part of
the power jostling going on in the Imperium of Milieu 0 will include
inter-system spying and a limited amount of covert action.  For diplomacy\'s
sake, it will be discrete, deniable, and only used for important and
suitable missions.

The PCs will be agents / troubleshooters of the government of a system in
the Imperium (I will be using the Imperium very loosely - I might tighten
it up if I buy M0).  They will travel from system to system (based mostly
around their home system), occasionally being contacted by local agents who
need some job done by outside agents who are more reliable than a bunch of
hard-up Travellers in one of the bars in Starport ;-).

Their first mission will involve trying to figure out what has happened at
an archeological dig on one of the planets in their system.  Some Ancient
(or is it?) technology has been found (and gotten loose - one of
Granfather\'s robots perhaps), and the government want to keep it for
themselves (to be studied at a secret research base), rather than handing
it over to the Imperium.  Unfortunately, the local Imperial Navy is based
on the planet, and the commander is being very helpful - offering to ferry
the PCs and any supplies from their ship to the dig, etc.  And someone else
has found out about it (and asked those Travellers from Starport, who were
refused a job about a paragraph back, to retrieve it).  Hopefully the
players will find lots of different types of challenges, from tactical, to
diplomatic, to downright sneaky.

Anyway, if anyone has any comments...

Cheers,
Liam

 The key here (I was the author of that portion of the Warrant -
 and most of the rest as well) is the word _recognized_.  In
 other words, some official representative of the Imperium with
 the power to do so has to agree that the representative does in
 fact have the right to speak for the prospective member.

 Also, a proclamation of allegiance is of no value if the
 allegiance is not accepted.  If the Emperor or his
 representatives don\'t think you\'re a member, you get none of
 the benefits of membership, and Article VIII makes it possible
 to say "OK, fine - but you\'re on your own in every way but
 name".  See my responses to your scenarios, below.

T::>Article VIII doesn\'t help.  It just says,

T::>"Nothwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in

 Or, as I suggest above, without kicking them out, they can have
 the name, but not the substance.

T::>Where might this problem arise?  (1) A world far from the Imperial

 Article VIII lets them get off the hook in this.  But yes, it\'s
 an adventure hook.  "We, Cleon, appreciate the expression of
 allegiance from the planet Hueiner.  As to the request for aid
 in the dispute with the planet Bhuuli, We note that the
 relationship between Hueiner and Bhulli has historically
 followed the pattern of the colonial relationship between
 Raandhimm and Ahdbol, in the vicinity of Sylea.  We note that
 this therefore appears to be an internal matter, and We see no
 compelling reason to interfere in an internal matter, as per
 the First Article of the Warrant of Restoration."

T::>(2) A group of highly developed worlds might decide to join the Imperium

 Same thing.  The Imperium can unilaterally choose to change the
 relationship between these worlds and itself.  That change
 _can_ be a total interdiction of the worlds in question.  Or an
 imposition of crushing taxes.  "We, Cleon, take note of the
 trade practices of the member worlds of the t\'Rhussit Cluster.
 As these practices, in our perception, endanger the safety of
 the Imperium as a whole, We therefore order a blockade of the
 worlds of the t\'Rhussit Cluster, and impose a temporary
 restabilization tax of fifteen hundred trillion Credits per
 annum upon each world in the Cluster."

 Yes, there are some loopholes in the Warrant.  But the really
 important ones are designed to give the _Imperium_ the
 strength.  It\'s really quite a one-sided document.  Mostly
 because of Article VIII.

Very well done!

I have been thinking along similar lines.  My current setup for my
subsector mapper has various valuable comments in it, such as clusters,
sector names, and so on, and I am thinking of adding trade routes or some
other such measure of goodness for a merchant.  Since the program already
has the data for the sector read in, this is not totally unreasonable.

(I am working on a long term project to read in the entire Imperium\'s data
as of Y0, and then do some Empire-wide statistics on trade, commerce, tech
level, and so on.  Talk about a busman\'s holiday for someone who write
econometric software...)

The best answer is to grab a copy of "Spacetime Physics," as it has some
really good descriptions of relativity and how to work with it.  Drop me a
line if you want the author, ISBN, and so on.

For the simple case of time one moving thing relative to a laboratory rest
frame (like in a particle accelerator), plug into

gamma = sqrt( 1- v^2/c^2)

gamma is your length contraction and time dilation factor.  For example, if
a particle is moving at 0.95c wrt me, I would see its time going as
sqrt(.0957) = 31% as fast as my own time.

Half of lightspeed gives a gamma = 0.866, so in 1000 years, your earthbound
friends would have aged 100 years, while you aged 866.  Note that the
problem is not symmetric because you accelerated.

>THERE IS NO TRAVELLER CANON!!!!...
[demonstrations of inconsistencies in Traveller]

BUT THERE SHOULD BE!!!!

Every time a supplement came out that was contradictory, foolish, or just
plain off the wall, I had to work hard to keep it consistent.  I put up
with that at various points by creating canon as needed, but I consider
each and every inconsistency a sign of a lack of professionalism on
someone\'s part.  Editor, designer, writer - someone!

Consider, any individual group can drop canon as they see fit, and nobody
should care.  When the underlying system blows its own past history on the
other hand, we all have to work a lot harder.  We have to decide whether
these jump torpedos are going to show up in future adventures, or whether
they are just an aberration.  Are there going to be more Primordial sites
out there?  Is TL16 enough better than TL15 to explain the Darrian
independence?

Every time this happens, we have to decide whether we are going to put up
with it or not, and eventually, one gets tired of it.  This is why I would
kind of like to see a commitment to canon on the part of IG.  This would
mean putting together a brief list of important facts that cannot be broken
by anyone without a clear statement that canon is breaking.  A tech 15
Vilani artifact, for example, is loathsome in the extreme under previous
canon.

Also, there is a form of canon, it is just not currently consistent.  For
example, anyone who creates a jump 7 drive has done a Traveller no-no.  The
Imperium came after a long night, and the long night took out star travel
virtually universally.  If someone changes a fact like this, then they had
best have a very good reason, and it better be carefully explained.

I made a plea a while ago, and I want to make it again - lets try to come
up with a short writer\'s guide.  I want something such that the typical
adventure writer, or background writer, or whatever has a prayer of not
busting something obvious, and so that those of us who are going to break
canon will do so with clear knowledge.

Good idea, but does not fit the Droyne Character.  Droynes are docile.
They were the Ancients only by association.  ALL Ancient artifacts,
history and super-tech came from 1 Droyne, yop thats it, 1 droyne only,
who was a freak of nature.  Eventually he genetically manipulated
20 children to help him, but without him there would be no Ancient sites,
technology or history.  Humanity would have been the first to the star\'s,
they would have discovered the Droyne who never developed naturally beyond
the feudal stage.  Grandfather drove them to achieve.

I wasn\'t going to respond to this post, but when I saw this

That\'s another reason why I subscribe to this list.  Sometimes I get

Your being one sided.  Droynes exist in an area greater then the Imperium
at its height combined with all the other Empire\'s.  Who knows how far
Grandfather spread the Droyne seed.  Which implies he knew about the
Hive/Aslan etc.  

 Read my other post, what I basically said was that the only time
Grandfather seemed to interfere with other races was when he needed
asisstents for his work.  I can only assume Humans were the only ones that
had any potential in this area and/or the other races were not sentinent
yet.

This is not a sales pitch--just curiosity.  I like to keep up on what 
people think of KBv2.0.

What doesn\'t KBv2.0 fix?

I play pretty close to the rules.  This is a matter time for me.  The 
system I used before T4 came out was a home brew version of TNE.  
Actually, it was TNE ideas and game mechanics using the MT task 
system.  I\'ve still got it if this sounds interesting to anyone.

When ever you have a House system you are forever tweaking the thing. 
 It made for a lot of out of game work for me.

Since, I have switched to the T4 rules pretty much as is.  I\'ll still 
tweak something that I can\'t live with--like the task system, but I 
fixed it keeping the same tradition of the original system in mind.

As we continue our campaign, I tend to tweak little things here and 
there, but basically, we\'re playing cannon T4.

It is nice now to let IG do the work, like they are supposed to.  I 
can look up a rule instead of having to research, invent, and create 
a new rule with my House system when we stubled upon something in our 
game that was new.  Now, I just look it up in the book and point to 
it.

I also don\'t have a problem using things from other editions of 
Traveller.  For example, I\'ve been shopping for a Traveller space 
combat system.  After looking at all of those official versions that 
have been created, I think I\'m about to decide on Brilliant Lances.

Before, I would have put all the time in to convert BL to the T4 
rules, but now, I don\'t think I\'ll do that.  I think I\'ll just use it 
as is and keep changes to a minimum.

I generally rate movies like this:

No stars                 One of the worst movies to ever wrinkle the 
                               back of your shirt.

1 Star                      A pretty poor movie.

2 Stars                    A serviceable movie if you are in the mood 
                                for it, but if you miss it, then no 
                                 big deal.

3 Stars                     A typical good movie--not great, mind 
                                 you, but a standard good movie.

4 Stars                     An incredible movie!  One that you will 
                                 like and talk about for years.

5 Stars                      One of the best movies you\'ve ever seen.


And so, I give the Fifth Element 3 stars.  If you are using this 
scale, then your 4 stars would mean that you really, really endorse 
it.

> <snipple of actress stuff which I totally agree with>

God, I think I saw the perfect woman.  Not by looks (which were 
pretty good), but by her personality.  This woman will do something 
for you.  Trust me.

I am, and I thought it wasn\'t that funny.  I was bored by it.  As a 
matter of fact, if I had done the movie, I would have cut out the 
"Artist Formerly Known as Prince" character all together.  

Yeah, he was funny, but the film had some other funny moments without 
him, and he really did nothing for the story.

I agree.  I liked the first half of the movie.  Then it got kinda 
stupid.  It was like they had a script, then had somebody else 
re-write part of it--which they probably did.

The second half of the film just didn\'t fit with the beginning.

It was.

True points.

Ooops!  For a moment there, I thought we were agreeing on a lot of 
topics.  It sounds like you didn\'t like Aliens (not Alien)--the 
second movie.  That was an action movie (you were right about the 
first one being a suspense film), and I consider Aliens one of the 
best movies I\'ve ever seen.

I love that film, and I gave it 5 stars.  I can\'t believe you didn\'t 
like the second Alien film.  Not only was it one of the best SciFi 
films I\'ve ever seen, it is also one of the best films I\'ve ever 
seen--period.

I see films like that one and it just humbles me.

I think that he was using the humans in his research and stuff, and put them wherever he 
had facilities.  Grandfather did think big.  I wonder how many minor human races the 
Zhodani core expeditions have found.

It could be that Grandfather is just a Hiver manipulation.  Maybe the Hivers actually 
did all the stuff Grandfather is said to have done, and then blamed Grandfather.

Good point:  all it takes for admission is the statement of a "recognized

Hmmm, after the recent discussion on "canon" of Traveller, and my normal
day to day observations of the list, I am getting worried.  I believe that  
Traveller is heading the way of Dungeons and Dragons.  It seems more and
more things are being created within Traveller which are more suited for a
a Fantasy game then a Sci-Fi game.  There\'s a lot of hand waving on many
issues, where things are explained as "it just works".

First thing on my Hit List is the whole Jump system, most already know
what my views are concerning this.

Second, is the whole "Virus" episode.  Can\'t say I really liked this idea
- - "oh no, not another dark age."  Also, is this sort of lifeform even
plausiable?

Also a few other niggling things, like fusion drives and Heplar\'s.

I am probably alone in this, but Traveller seems to be heading the same
way as a lot of modern sci-fi generally is (including shows like Trek and
b5) - its just plain fantasy, no basis in any science whatsoever.  The
greatest, and I dare say only appeal to me of Traveller was its
foundation in science.  I just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same
way?

I would much rather an Arthur C. Clarke style Traveller Universe then an
ID4 styled one.  Reality check time.

Does anyone NOT know my stance on all the above? ;->

Background:  I think the level of insistance that the published background
is the "one true background" is what is too great.  I enjoyed watching the
GDW Imperium develop, I still remember the kick I got out of "War!" on the
cover of the Journal, but that was always GDW\'s universe..not mine.  My
Imperium was never exactly like their Imperium, my "5th Frontier War"
wasn\'t their "5th Frontier War", and mine was every bit as validly
Traveller as their\'s.  That\'s my point!

You don\'t really mean to say that any deviation from published details
makes a game non-Traveller do you?  There *are* some people here that give
me that impression.

Rules:  Who knows!  Shoot, as far as I\'m concerned *all* my
mechanics are home-brewed..even the ones I pull right out of some book *I*
bought, ;-> I\'m the one that decided to use them after all. Seriously, I\'d
guess it\'s about 50/50, but the 50% that come out of some Traveller book
could be any version from CT to the present.

Sorry, K.C., that\'s not canon.  Canon is LAW.  What you are
describing are game books and modules, at most *suggested* rules of
behavior.  Over the past 20 years I\'ve bought lots of those books, and I
never found one LAW in any of them...lot\'s of rules, no laws.

Marc, Loren, nor Frank never dropped by to bless or damn my games. They
never required an orthodoxy test when I laid my money down. They never
threatened to take back their books if I didn\'t follow their rules.  ;->

Do you think I don\'t use my CT books?  I use them as much as I use my MT or
TNE books.  More than my T4 books..right now, but that could change.  What
*I* mainly use is my imagination and judgment applied to ANY source of
information.  I create my universes using as much or as little of the
material found in any book or module as *I* decide...period!  Newer
versions don\'t invalidate older versions, they are just newer versions. 
The way I see things, when things don\'t fit together it\'s *your* job to
work it all out.

K.C., you don\'t need some rulebook\'s validation to know when you\'re playing
Traveller...do you?  ;->

When I play in a universe with Romulans, Klingons, warp drive, transporters
and a Federation I\'m probably playing Startrek..even if I\'m uesing stock
Traveller rules.  When I run a game in a ficton with "Evil Empires", heavy
breathers, magical "forces", and \'cross the universe in a day hyperdrives\'
it\'s either Star Wars or B5. OTOH, when the universe is set in a future
that has stl
communications, has \'cut off from the universe several day long\' ftl
transportation, attempts to explain it\'s technology in realistic terms, and
has no magic...I call it Traveller.

Notice, I didn\'t mention the *specific* technologies or background at all? 
I don\'t think either is required for a game to be
Traveller, and that\'s what makes me a heretic.

You do realize that to be a heretic you have to be a believer, don\'t you? 
If I *rejected* all things black and red, I wouldn\'t be here, nor would I
be interested in discussing any of these issues.  I do agree with, and use,
many Traveller traditions.  I think games work better with internally
consistent rules, and changes need to be well thought out before being
implemented.  I\'m not a libertine, but I do believe in free, enlightened,
choice.

What I don\'t believe in is "the one true way" to Traveller.  I don\'t
believe in forcing anyone to play the game the "one right way", for there
are many paths to enlightenment...oops wrong religion. ;->

So KC, I propose, you play your way, I\'ll play it mine, and everyone else
can do the same.  You can be as orthodox as you like, I can be as heretical
as I like, and everyone else can decide for themselves. Deal?

So at 99% the speed of light we are looking at for every 1000 years on

At the speed of light they would not age at all (time stops).

   It is up to Marc Miller to enforce canon on IG, since he has taken on
the task of personally reviewing each chapter of new publications.  If
he choses not to, so be it.  That\'s where we get into a discussion of
\'Canon\' (what is accepted by the vast majority of Traveller players as
correct or "reality") vs. canon (what the current publisher says is
correct or "reality").  Jump drives are Canon, while being able to
calculate the direction of jump depending upon how a ship entered jump
space was canon (under TNE).  The Second Imperium is Canon, while a max
TL of 15 for the Second Imperium is canon (for now under T4).

   My heirarchy of canon goes something like this:

1) Background material generated by GDW, including items that appeared
in JTAS or Challenge

2) Background material generated by DGP, including items that appeared
in Traveller Digest (up to MT Journal #3)

3) Background material by other "Approved for Use With Traveller"
sources, or other officially recognised publications, including T4 and
Traveller Chronicle

4) Background material generated by HIWG, or other similar fan
organizations

5) Background material published in non-officially approved sources
(fanzines, White Dwarf, etc.)

6) Background material posted here, the WWW, etc.

   If DPG produced something in 1989 that contradicts a GDW publication
(say something that appears in "Solomani and Aslan" that goes against
something in "Alien Module 6: Solomani") the GDW publication takes
prescedent.  There is of course some flexibility here.  If GDW published
two items in contradiction to each other and one of the lesser sources
fixes the problem, I recognize the fix.  If something appears in *any*
non-GDW source that totally blows away game balance but for some reason
wasn\'t contradicted by GDW (i.e. Paranoia Press\' ringworlds, rosettes,
etc. in The Beyond), I ignore it as non-canon. 

   In the case of T4\'s TL 15 Second Imperium, or TL 14 vacc suits, I
cheerfully ignore them.

   IG is in serious danger in many people\'s books of becoming
non-Canon.  I need not remind everyone (especially fans of TNE) what
happens when canon isn\'t Canon.

   I for one did not leave Traveller, Traveller (or at least canon
Traveller, currently T4) left me.

One of these days, I gotta look up "canon" in the dictionary.

   According to Webster\'s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the
English Language:

can.on, n.  1. an ecclesiastical rule or law enacted by a council or
other competent authority and, in the Roman Catholic Church, approved by
the Pope.  2. the body of ecclesiastical law.  3. the body of rules,
principles, or standards accepted as axiomatic and universally binding
in a field of study or art: "the Neoclassical canon".  4. a fundamental
principle or general rule: "He violated the canons of good behavior". 
5. a standard; criterion: "He was interested in the canons of taste." 
6. the books of the Bible recognized by any Christian church as genuine
and inspired.  7. any officially recognized set of sacred books.  8. any
comprehensive list of books within a field.  9. the works of an author
which have been accepted as authentic: "There are 37 plays in the
Shakespeare canon".

   Some additional definitions that aren\'t relevant, but you get the
idea...

>There is, however, a written history of space and humaniti, which
>is accepted in all version of Traveller. The three Imperia, the seven
>major races, the three "major" branches of humaniti, the various "minor"
>races. the (rough) layout of space, etc. 

   This is Canon (note the big \'C\').

>Now, when you go and say "the maximum TL reached by the Rule of Man
>was TL 15", this, uh, kind of buggers things up. It really plays
>with the written, descriptive history of the Imperium. It would be
>like a modern historian saying "Yeah, the Romans had a large assortment
>of small firearms. No big deal."

   Good analogy.  So why the basic contradiction?  Conspiracy theorists
will tell you that it is all a plot by IG and Marc Miller to make the
previous GDW material non-canon, and eventually non-Canon.  This in turn
forces collectors and Traveller fans to buy T4 products to keep up with
canon/Canon.  If only IG was that organized...

>My complaint about "canon" was really pretty much about meson guns in

   What about Fusion Plus?  Now *that* flies in the face of Canon as
well.  Fusion power plants are frankly *assumed* on small craft at TL 10
or so onward, but not in T4, where you have to wait until TL 12.

   My impression is that certain writers (and I\'m not naming names) are
being allowed to write official material even though they have only the
vaguest understanding of Traveller Canon.  This is not the way that GDW
ran the circus.  Dave Nilsen, et al. were almost of the verge of
paranoia when it came to making sure that TNE products didn\'t contradict
what had come before in the way of GDW Traveller storylines.  That
careful attention to detail meant, no matter what you thought of Virus,
that TNE was both internally consistent and consistent with the material
from classic Traveller and MegaTraveller (try reading the Regency
Sourcebook, if you are lucky enough to find it, to see what I mean).

Oh-oh, I guess I was unclear.

I was referring to the *third* one. ;-)

Although I don\'t seem to be as enthusiastic about the second as you are, 
I agree that it was a great film, even though it was completely different 
from the first.

As for your dislike of "the artist formerly known as prince" character, I 
too, disliked him. I couldn\'t understand a word he said. But I think that 
was the point. He and that other wimp-actor were symbolic of the 
degenerative nature of stardom. The media elevates the worst of the 
genepool to stardom; heroes are found in the cab-drivers of the world.

You\'re quite right about that dumb scene in the middle. Totally 
unnecessary.

How about the "Concise History of the Third Imperium," published in the
Traveller\'s Digest and now available on... um... somebody\'s web site.
(The one that titles itself the AAB -- I think the original author of the
article is the maintainer).  If I recall correctly, he\'s also gone back to
add in a similar summary of the First Imperium.

And, of course, Don McKinney\'s Traveller Timeline is a valiant attempt to
corral all the wacky little facts and events that have been published by
GDW and licensees.  Basically, every IG author should have web access and
the will to check the sources.  :-)

	Nope. What I\'m saying is it was a long weekend, a late night, and a dry
brain. As I\'ve been informed, the correct tau factor is apparently

	1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)

so for every 1000 years on board the ship, 1,154 years pass outside. This
sounds better, as relativistic effects don\'t really start mushrooming until
higher fractions. At 0.9c, 2,294 years would pass, etc.

	It doesn\'t have to grapple on to large areas, per se. The actual grapples
themselves may take only a few square meters on each ship (for small
craft), plus another square meter or two for a connecting tunnel between
the two. But while the small craft is grappled, it\'s covering a much larger
portion of the mothership that then can\'t be used for sensors, weapons,
etc. (unless you figure your first shot will just blow a hole through the
small craft, leaving your weapon free to fire further shots at the enemy).
Here\'s a drawing. Think of "M" as representing a grapple. All of the
surface area marked "=" on the mothercraft is unavailable to put much of
anything else on, simply because it\'s covered by the small craft.

	Sure, the actual grapples themselves only take a little, but the effect is
to use up much more. On the other hand, I agree that L^2 is WAY too high.

traveller is all about.. aren\'t they... 


Last defiant act.

Hmmph... that doesn\'t mean that some of the other things that people have
been saying are canon (eergh, I hate that term), actually are. I agree with
Scott, let\'s make a list of idea\'s that define what traveller is, edit them
until we can all agree (this list had better be short!), and use that as a
common framework from which we can all use to communicate with.

I\'ll start the ball rolling with jump drives.

1. The maximum is jump six.

2. Jump takes one week 

3. While in jump, any interaction with other ships in jump, or with normal
space is completely immpossible.

I have lot\'s of other **opinions** about jump drives, but I am trying to
limit myself to **facts**. If I have missed something, please tell me, and
I will add it to the list. I will repost the list at regular intervals so
that people may discuss what should be taken out or put in. I will give
three warnings, before I do a final post of what defines the idea of jump
drives in traveller.

And then I\'ll....    hmmm... lets just see how this jump drive thing
goes... I\'ll be interested to see if we can come to an agreement on this.

	hmm, maybe I came across wrong. I certainly don\'t believe in an orthodoxy 
text before you can purchase Emperor\'s Arsenal, for example. If you want to 
bastardize the rules, by all means go ahead. More power to ya.

	But that doesn\'t mean the canon doesn\'t exist. It does, you just choose to 
pick-and-choose the parts you use. And heck, thats probably a lot more fun 
than trying to stick religiously to the existing canon.

I guess what I was arguing for, though, was for self-consistency in 
published Traveller material. While you Eris should feel free to ignore any 
part of the canon that gets in your way, IMPERIUM GAMES SHOULD NOT!

	IG and MM should, to the best of their ability, follow the existing canon 
as closely as possible when designing new supplements and books. And even 
being the heretic that you are, I think you can agree with that.

	But there should be "one official, published way" for Traveller. It 
doesn\'t have the same ring as "the one true way", but when you start having 
three or four different PUBLISHED ways the game is heading down the wrong 
track.

	Absolutely. I never wanted to come across as demanding the game be played 
a certain way. In other games, I have frequently begged, borrowed and 
stolen different supplements from different games. When done right, it is 
infinitely better than religiously following the published material.

	But what\'s good for the goose is not good for the gander. IG does not have 
that same liberty to freely deviate from published material.

	"Traveller is HEADING towards being a Fantasy game", and you mention Jump 
drives as the culprit? I\'m afraid to tell you that Jump drives have been 
around since 1977. It \'aint "heading" anywhere.

	Now after I just wrote a big long defense of the Traveller Canon, I\'ll 
repeat myself. Jump drives, as written, are an inherent part of Traveller. 
If you don\'t like them, fine. By al means, go ahead and use an alternate 
FTL system from FF&S, or make up your own, but that isn\'t Traveller.

	As you no doubt know, a lot of people agree with you. Thats why T4 has 
pretty much ignored the whole TNE setting. So if you don\'t like it, then 
fine.

	You\'re not totally alone, but...

	It all comes down to suspension of disbelief. As long as the scientific 
innacuracies aren\'t so obvious that they hit you in the face (like the 
shows you mentioned), then I\'m happy. As long as I, a reasonably educated, 
scientifically mined individual, can accept a given piece of technology at 
first glance, I could care less that if you closely look at the laws of 
thermodynamics and start doing all kinds of  calculations, thruster plates 
wouldn\'t work.

	To tell you the truth, until I bought FF&S I had never though of that 
problem about thruster plates (and I\'ve been around since CT). And I still 
could care less because of that fact.

>I would much rather an Arthur C. Clarke style Traveller Universe then an
>ID4 styled one.  Reality check time.

	But ask yourself which is Traveller closer to? And I would much rather 
have the Traveller universe as currently written than have it ruined by 
some misguided attempt make it more scientifically accurate.

	But dosn\'t it depend on what you mean by a "maximum" of jump six? After 
all, starships have been misjumping a great deal durther than that for 
years! It is a maximum of Jump six at TL 15 (and perhaps 16 or 17).

	And of course, its not exactly one week. Its +/- a little bit, as well.

Nope!

My last piece of mail from your fine country was from IG themselves and had 
$1.40 on it.  Besides - I would consider each country to be the general 
equivalent of a world in Traveller (Each Land mass in any case).  But

Thought you\'d never ask 8-)

My picture of the basic Llyrnian biochemistry is one which evolved to 
gain energy from sulfur.  When more complex. longer-lived organisms 
evolved, they suffered from oxygen poisoning -- this might be a bit 
like carbon monoxide poisoning for us, where all the oxygen-carrying 
sites in red blood are bound up by CO, and we can\'t breathe, and die.
Oxidation would also damage genetic information, in an analogous way 
to ionising radiation, and hence maybe provide a mechanism for 
mutation.

The evolutionary stimulus would be to reduce the deleterious effects 
of oxygen.  Firstly, organisms developed a tough external coat, using 
the oxygen in an organosilicate outer layer.  This reduced oxygen 
intake from the atmosphere.  It is also the ultimate source of those 
tough claws...

Larger organisms, faced with a need to lose heat to their 
environment, developed respiratory systems which used the thin 
atmosphere for cooling.  This greatly increased the damage which 
oxygen did, but simultaneously gave an advantage to the larger 
creatures (feeding, whatever).  Thanks to the mutating effects of 
oxygen, Llyrnians quickly evolved to use their oxygen intake to their 
own advantage.  Through organo-semimetallic metabolic pathways, they 
used oxygen to reclaim stored sulfur from waste products, storing the 
resulting fuel in lung-like sacs.  Thus, the modern Llyrnian has two 
distinct metabolic mechanisms:

(basic) Biochemistry based on C, N, Si, S, O, and a little H.  (This 
is intended to reflect what\'s available on a small planet.)  Sulfur 
is the fuel for this chemistry, and waste products are rich in 
sulfur, predominantly solid or fluid.

(additional) Oxygen metabolism converts waste products back to 
organosilicates and sulfur, producing SO2 gas as waste (which is 
exhaled to cool the organism).

This has the nice side-effect that Llyrnian troops do indeed smell of 
brimstone, like all the best demons...

Hope this triggers a few ideas,

Nick

Actually, the species 300,000 years ago aren\'t *that* different (if I
recall correctly). If not, then it\'s a wonder that the various branches
of humaniti look much more like each other than humans, chimps, and
gorillas.

There are two related numbers used for this sort of thing. Tau and
gamma. Gamma=1/tau.

	Tau=sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2))

A handy check figure is that .8c has a tau of .6 and vice versa.

For working with calculators, there\'s a more convenient formula:
	tau=sin(arcsin(v/c))

This is only good for constant velocities. For constant accelerations,
the formulas get messier.

Anyway, the answer is tau of .866 for a time of 866 years.

If you\'d wanted to know the earth time for a ship time of 1000 years,
you\'d use gamma instead of tau.

Actually, the methods of FTL break down into a lot more than 2 types.

1. FTL in "real" space. Somehow you just go FTL but you are essentially
   in normal space and can see and be seen. Star Trek uses this.
2. "Hyperspace". You go into a hyperspace where distances travelled
   correspond to much greater distances in normal space.
3. "Jump" you exit normal space and reenter at a point greatly
   seperated from your starting point. Normally there\'s no time lag
   between entry and exit.
4. "Warp" you warp space until your start and end points are identical.
.... etc

Traveller is more 2 than 3, but has elements of both. I\'ve seen logical
lists of around a dozen categories...

There is another equally "possible" solution. The Alcubierre warp
drive. It essentially destroys space-time in front of the ship and
creates it behind the ship. Or you can think of it as creating a wave
in spacetime which the ship rides like a surfboard.

The two big problems with wormholes are that while we have ideas about
how to enlarge and stabilize them we have no ideas as to how to
*create* them, at least not creating ones with widely seperated ends,
and controlling *where* the ends are.

The few proposals for creating wormholes have them formed with the ends
close together. You then have to *move* the ends to where you want them.
But this opens up the possibility of time travel.... Read Forward\'s
book "Timemaster" for details.

It doesn\'t *dis*-agree all that badly, and has the advantage of having
limits such that time travel (an inescapable consequence of FTL) is
very, very difficult.

Well, I\'ve had the "honor" of being present when a bull couldn\'t get to

It wouldn\'t be the *same thing psychologically. Supposedly the
"castration fear come from a young boy seeing a naked girl or woman and
thinking that they had theirs cut off. Obviously, that won\'t happen
with Sayat.

Well, it depends. They may have a taboo about masturbation, they may
not. Heck, it may not even be *possible* (ie you need the stimulus of a

There are three kind of grappels in FFS, Airframe, Streamlined, and
Unstreamlined.  So have to say what type your are talking about. AF
grappels take up the most room and mass, because they need to smooth
over any rough interfaces and make sure nothing disrupts the airflow.  

What you are talkinga bout above would be an USL grappel.

Hmmm, and just what was that law...Oh yeah:

CLARKE\'S THIRD LAW OF TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION:

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

	Well, remove Jump Drive, fusion and HePLar (I just randomly
capitalize bits:) and what have you got? certainly not Traveller. 

	Remove all the handwaving, and what have you got? A rather boring
game called \'Reality\'.

	If you build a game around stl travel between the stars, you can\'t
realistically have interaction between different systems, or between
ships and systems...all you\'re left with is one planet, or one ship, and
the game certainly wouldn\'t be Traveller.

	The problem with grounding Traveller so firmly in present day
science is that it\'s NOT SET IN THE PRESENT DAY, DAMMIT!!! In three or
four thousand years Clarkes third law will still apply, and with a
vengeance. All told, I think that Traveller represents a far, far too
conservative progression of technology, if anything, the \'reality\'
presented to us if we were somehow transported there would be akin to the
reactions of an Egyptian ca. 2000 BC transported to the present day: 
"Ayup, I\'m in the land of the Gods, no doubt about it!" 

	Well, maybe he wouldn\'t say "Ayup!"

	Besides, maybe it wouldn\'t be so bad if Traveller went the way of
D&D, after all. Hmmm...well thought out rules (by now, anyway ;-),
properly edited source books, huge world-wide player base, and bankrupt
parent company...Oops, better not push it too far :-)

	Traveller is based on a few simple, but technologically handwaved
assumptions, actually, two linked ones, in fact. Jump Drives take a week
to get where they\'re going, and this limits the speed of communication.
This forms the foundation of everything that drives Traveller society, and
THAT, folks, is the realm in which we role play, not the technology. The
two are inextricably bound, though, so if you change the technology, you
change the other. 

	I\'ve argued this point before, but _I_ think it bears repeating.
The soul of the game, of any game, is the magic it brings to the mind of
the players, the wonders of going somewhere you can\'t get in reality, the
new vistas it opens in your minds eye. There are stylistic differences
between games, but all in all they are all fantasy to some extent.

	Suspending your disbelief is crucial to any of them, whether
you\'re imagining fighting a troll in the dank recesses of a dungeon,
battling Stormtroopers on some Deathstar, or hopping in your Free Trader,
setting the coordinates, and punching the Jump drive button. I don\'t CARE
about the precise details of how a jump drive works, as long as it works
pretty much the same way each time. Consistency is the key. 

	If by this attitude you don\'t think that I\'m playing Traveller,
well, tough...I think I am, and that\'s all that matters.

That would be Bryan Borich\'s excellent reference site at:

Sure enough, he has Concise Histories available for all three Imperia,
plus some information on non-Imperial megacorporations, world names
from published materials, sector names and data, and a list of minor
races (including those from Aliens Archive).  I highly recommend it.

I have never seen any articles stating that jump increases at TL\'s higher
than 15, in fact I have a dim memory of J-6 being tha max full stop. If
anyone can tell me if and why I am wrong, please do so.

OK....

1. The maximum jump controlled is jump six.
2. Jump takes one week, plus or minus one day
3. While in jump, any interaction with other ships in jump, or with normal
space is completely immpossible.

Well some strange RPG as this one could be integrated in a secondary adventure

I explain :
Before playing TNE, I was playing WhiteWolf games (Vampire, Mage ...). They
used a technic (usable with any RPG) which is interesting in the concept :
it\'s the Secondary Adventure

You have you main adventure with a set of character defined by the players,
right, common! Now you (GM) build a secondary story in the same world but
in a completly different setting (other world or even other era!). This
adventure has to be much smaller (max 20% of total game play), usually the
characters are defined by the GM, not by the players. Those characters are
usually much more simple. The storyline is much more rigid than the main
adventure, more a story than a adventure in fact.

The only goal of this second  adventure is to enhance the theme (mood,
subject...) of you main adventure by showing it in a different point of
view (Pre-collapse/New Era, New Era/New-Millenium, Human/Virusses,
HighTL/LowTL, Rich/Poor people or more simply goodguys/badguys).

As a GM you can swap your setting during playtime. The hard thing is to
choose the right time to swap to get the best effect. WhiteWolf suggested
to swap right after the most intense scenes, just before the pressure goes
down. 


I\'ve used this technic in a classic Vampire story. The Vampire characters
were manipulated by an elder Vampire (ultra classic). And I put a secondary
story in which they played regular human beeings which tries to manupulate
other humans. The players liked it very well, they said they had a better
understanding of NPC psychology. The main drawback is that you need quite
large playtime to use this technic

Hmmm.... that seems to be a whole new topic of intersteller communications
(although I do admit that it uses the fastest jump drives available, maybe
we can just say that the speed of communications at TL-15 is limited to
light speed, and that interstellar communications are achieved by the use
of jump ships, them leave that for the communications section, to come
later...)

so now we have...

1. The maximum controlled jump is jump six.
2. Jump takes one week, plus or minus one day
3. While in jump, any interaction (including communication) with other
ships in jump, or with normal space is completely impossible.

Here\'s an odd though for the gearheads...

What if you made a reaction drive from just water vapor? Here\'s the 
idea:

Use water (or some other volatile liquid) as a reaction mass...pump 
this through the cooling system of the powerplant to get 
copious quantities of steam, and vent that out the back of the ship 
for thrust. Can you generate several G\'s worth of pressure that way? 
The steam isn\'t radioactive (assuming no leaks in the PP radiator) 
and should be fairly eco-friendly. You can couple this with CG to get 
off planet, then kick the M-drive in.

I would hasten to point out that of all the other SF games out there 
(possibly with the exception of 2300 AD, RIP), Traveller has the 
least amount of handwaving and is the closest to hard SF. The problem 
with SF is that niggling "fiction" part...somewhere along the line 
you have to close your eyes and say "I believe." How you get to that 
point (which is the handwaving part) is your own business. Science 
sez there is no such thing as FTL transit or FTL commo, so that makes 
the Imperium a moot point. You have to give the fantasy a little room 
to maneuver with fiction, or it\'s just fact. Unfortunately science 
fact is far more boring at times than SF...

Also, didn\'t someone on list figure out that the "push on the star"
handwave kinda works (with transit times to 100 diameters in the 30
hour range)?

I have to disagree...I like the idea of making Traveller science a 
little harder, by beefing up the handwaving or by coming up with a 
small change that passes reality check better. I mean really, does 
the fact that someone uses M-drives as written or some other hybrid 
thing invalidate the game or the setting? No. The Traveller Universe 
makes a couple of inherent assumptions about FTL travel that set the 
scene...the rest is a study in sociology and economics. The fact that 
you use Thruster Plates and I like reaction drives doesn\'t change 
that. And as far as heretics "not playing Traveller" then whet the 
hell are we doing? The setting is the big thing, not the tech. The 
techis just a trapping.

	So, why don\'t we work up a list of standard dT grapples for various
airframe types? It seems to me that he QSDS grapples were built to
handle the most extreme of cases: needle airframe types grappling to an
airframe hull. We could ake a list of SSDS grapples which would be more
specific - vary them by mothership airframe type, and assume a
needle/cylinder hull configuration for the babyship. That would take
into account most of the basic auxillary craft I\'ve seen in the books
under 100dT.

AaaRGH! I replied to this yesterday, but my message disappeared! :-< Did
I cancel instead of send? Did the internet absorb my message without a
trace? Is it still lost in the aether?

The point I made in this lost missive was that if you decide that
wormhole theory is the basis of the way FTL travel works, that doesn\'t
mean you have to change the way Traveller jump-drives work.

I then proceeded to hand-wave my way through a rather extensive
description of how Traveller Wormhole-jumpdrives could be explained
without seriously meddling with things Traveller takes for granted like
misjumps, 1 week travel times, 6-jump limit, etc.

But now all that bullshittium is lost! Tragedy! (?)

I think I\'ll take a deep breath and if you ask me nice, I\'ll try to
remember what I typed yesterday and resend... but first I\'ll see if this
message arrives...

At 99%, sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) = .141, which means that in 1000 years of earth
time, the people on the ship will have aged 141 years.  I do wish that
there was an easy way to write an equation clearly in a news post, as that
would make this a lot more obvious. :(

(Side note: twin paradox.  From the ship\'s perspective, they will think
that the people on earth will have aged 141 years while they aged 1000.
Each will think the other was the moving one, and thus that the other
should be younger.  In order to solve this so-called twin paradox, you have
to include the ship stopping and coming back, or otherwise synchronizing
their clocks.  Once you find out who accelerated, you know who is younger -
the person who accelerated is the person who really had time go slow of the
two people.)

>At the speed of light they would not age at all (time stops).

That is what the formula says, and there is no reason presently to
disbelieve it.  At v=c, the formulas seem to work, as long as all particles
and only particles moving at lightspeed have zero mass.  This implies
fairly heavily, subject to new data, that the relativity corrections work
up to v=c.

>Beyond the Speed of Light barrier I would move backwards in time (?)

Correct, if you believe the numbers from the formula, though many
relativists do not think it holds for v>c.  According to relativity theory,
you get time travel and failure of simultaneity as soon as you get FTL
travel, but it is quite possible that light speed is an absolute barrier,
or that different laws come into play.  One important point - we have NO
data about FTL.

Any theory can be right, as long as it simplifies to one we know at the
speeds we work at.  In a typical lab setting of 1km/s or less, the
relativistic correction is far too small to measure, so relativity only
became needed when we started examining domains where classical laws did
not hold. The same might well be true of some FTL theory.

Firstly, nobody knows how to travel faster than light, so there is no
"body of knowledge on the subject." :=>

Wormholes haven\'t yet been proven to exist, because they haven\'t been
observed. Blackholes have been pretty much proven, because objects which
are easily explained by black hole theory have been observed.

If you accept current theory about wormholes, and wish to postulate that
in the future larger, stable, wormholes will be able to be made, and if
you feel wormholes are a better method for interstellar travel, then by
all means use wormholes.

BUT... there\'s no need to throw Traveller Jumpdrives out the window,
just explain them using "wormhole lingo". Nobody knows how long a trip
through a wormhole would take, nor how much energy it would take to
create one. So there\'s no reason to change the way interstellar travel
in Traveller works.

Here\'s an example of wormhole theory which agrees with most Traveller
conventions:


TRAVELLER JUMPSPACE WORMHOLE THEORY
- ----

Wormholes connect two places in realspace by "tunnelling" through an
alternate space which we call "Jumpspace". Natural wormholes have been
too small and transient to be used for interstellar travel, and were
never thought to be a viable method for travel over interstellar
distances. The discovery of Jump Drives changed that.

There are three steps necessary for a ship to create a wormhole to
travel over interstellar distances:

Firstly, a course must be plotted through jumpspace. So far,
calculations of beyond 6 parsecs have been found impossible to solve.
Though it has not yet been proven insoluble, mathematicians made it
their "holy grail" ever since Fermat\'s Last Theorem was proven.

Secondly, a jumpspace field is created around a ship in order to allow
it to enter the wormhole. Matter not within a particle field in
resonance with the wormhole cannot enter. A certain mass equivalent to
aproximately 100 displacement tons or greater is required to enter the
wormhole. Nearby gravitational masses cause the wormhole to become
unstable. As a rule of thumb, distances beyond 100 diameters from large
planetary bodies are relatively safe.

Thirdly, the jumpdrive "drills" the wormhole by creating a massive
energy pulse of exotic particles. These particles are most commonly
created through the fusing of hydrogen; the exact catalytic and doping
process is poorly understood by even the most advanced of Imperial
physicists. The particles are neutrino-like, and pass through most
matter, so building a weapon from a jump-drive is impractical at best.

TRAVEL
- ----

The ship enters the wormhole, and travels to its calculated destination.
Since the wormhole has been plotted to the destination before entry, the
destination cannot be changed once the ship enters jumpspace.

Time to travel any distance through the wormhole is relatively
invariant, being 168 hours +/- 10%. A ship entering the wormhole is
acted upon by a constant "acceleration" to the midpoint of the trip and
a constant "decceleration" of the same magnitude from the midpoint to
the destination. The "acceleration" varies from wormhole to wormhole,
but has never been found to cause a greater than 10% variation in travel
time.

(Note: Quotes are used because acelleration is only an analogous term.
In a strict sense, the ship isn\'t acted upon by any force. As an
analogy, imagine a trip through a frictionless tunnel connecting two
points on earth. A trip of any distance would take the same amount of
time)

A side-effect of this property of wormholes is that a fleet using
tight-beam communications to synchronize calculations can use the same
wormhole for travel, by ensuring that their jumpspace fields resonate at
the same frequency. This means that the fleet arrives at its destination
at the same time, whatever the uncertainty in the 10% happens to be.
Each ship must generate its own "portal" to the wormhole, however. 

"Jumpgates", or the external drilling of wormholes, has been found to be
impractical with current Imperial technology because it is imperative
that the drilling process originate from *within the jumpspacee field*.
In other words, once the source generates the wormhole, it *must* enter
the wormhole.

MISJUMPS
- ----

In general, misjumps occur due to two reasons:

1) Disruption in wormhole stability

Generally caused by gravitational disturbances. The creation of a
wormhole entry point too close to a local planet, for example.

In this case, either the course of the wormhole is altered, and the ship
ends up in a completely undesired location, or, if gravity is strong
enough, the gravitational tidal forces act as a lens, constricting the
wormhole and forcing it to be smaller than intended. In this case, the
ship ends up at its destination in slightly smaller pieces... a
meatgrinder works in a similar fashion.

2) Disruption in jumpspace field intergrity

Generally caused by poor jumpdrive maintenance, using impure fuel, or
damage to the Lanthanum Grid.

If the disruption is relatively uniform, what can happen is the
frequency of the field can shift in mid-course. The ship in jumpspace
"skips" from its intended wormhole to another wormhole matching its new
field frequency. Since millions of these "virtual wormholes" are created
every second, the ships new destination is impossible to predict.

I leave the effects of a partial field-frequency "shift" as an exercise
to the reader...

By the way, Grandfather, at TL-21+, was noted for his "trans-jump
drive", which allowed him to adjust his field frequency while in
jumpspace. Legends state that he had the technology to predict wormhole
destinations and by choosing when and at what point to "skip wormholes",
he could not only break the current jump-6 limit, he also wasn\'t limited
by the 1-week travel time.

Note that he and I have exactly the same numbers, even though mine look
different.  :)  (I have seen a lot of flamewars on sci.physics.relativity
start because two people were using inverses, and someone did not notice.)

gamma = .866, tau = 1.154, gamma = 1/tau.  1000 years on the ship is 1154
years on earth, 1000 years on earth is 866 years on the ship.

Ah, good point.  The fine points of Freudian psychology pretty much elude me.

TML content:  What\'s the field of psychiatry like in the Third Imperium?
Is it a despised pseudo-science, thanks to a ripple effect from
anti-Zhodani/anti-psionic prejudice?  Or are there scads of top-notch
Imperial researchers working feverishly to combat the psionic menace?

Sayat content:  I think there\'s no parent-child incest taboo among the
Sayat, in our sense of the term -- they don\'t recognize personal,
biological parenthood as a durable status.  A strong pressure towards
exogamy is probably present -- people are expected to socialize with others
outside their own \'nest,\' and generally keep the memes & genes moving
around throughout the whole Sayat population.

I\'ve got a bit more \'cultural\' info on the Sayat, then some \'history\' --
thing is, I still can\'t figure out *where* I\'d like to locate them.  I\'m
starting to sympathize with Grandfather:  Pocket universes!  That\'s the
ticket! <G>

Well, de gustibus non est disputandum, or however it goes -- me, I\'ve found

Shatner\'s novels are good for a laugh <G>.

Quiptech Press Release

Quiptech is pleased to announce its newest ship, the Ming-class Exploratory
Trader.  Designed to trade opportunities outside of the Imperium, the Ming
is fully equipped with many modern features.
 
Cargo is key to any trading opportunity, and here at Quiptech, we feel that
we understand this.  The Ming comes equipped with over 350 standard
displacement tons of cargo area within itself, as well as over 400 tons of
cargo area in specially designed cargo modules.  Each module comes equipped
with its own Life Suport and AG/IC systems that can be turned on and off
individually to preserve power.  This also allows the Ming to carry a
variety of different cargoes with the least amount of spoilage.

Twin Grasshopper-class Modular Support vessels are included with the Ming to
allow for faster loading and unloading of cargo.  Each Grasshopper is
capable of 5G\'s of thrust to quickly move cargo from the surface to the
Ming.  The AF hulls of the Grasshoppers also help speed up the process.

What good is cargo if you can\'t protect it?  That\'s why the Ming is equipped
with a level 6 Meson screen as well as 8 Sandcasters for defense.  In
addition, the twin laser batteries and the missile launcher will give the
attacking craft something to think about while the Ming makes its escape.
(Imperial Permits may be required.)

"How?" you ask.  The Ming (and all 15 of the Cargo/Fuel Modules) come
equipped with Collapsible Fuel Bladders.  We reccommend that before the Ming
jumps out of system, all of these Bladders that can be are filled with fuel.
During the jump, this fuel can be purified and pumped into the Mings fuel
tank, giving the Ming the ability to perform an emergency Jump at any time
after entering a system.

Of course, your cargo isn\'t valuable unless you can get it back to port, so,
the Ming is equipped with both an Engineering and Vehicle Shop and is more
than able to repair most parts while in the field.  But being able to fix
your ship is not going to help if there is no one to fly it. When you visit
new worlds, there is always the chance that a new virus or microbody will be
encountered, so the Ming is also equipped with a 2-bed sick bay and
laboratory to give the Medical staff an extra edge in finding the cure.  But
if, Ancients forbid, you are unable to find the cure, the Ming is also
equipped with more than enough low berths to preserve the injured or sick
crewmember until the cure can be found.

When you are away from home on Exploratory Trading missions, crew morale can
play a large part in whether you make a profit or not.  It is for this
reason that the Ming provides a small stateroom for each crewmember and a
large stateroom for the command and medical crew.  In addition, there is a
specially designed Galley/Mess area allowing the stewards more room to
provide for more tasteful and healthier meals. The crew can be treated to a
tri-d from a vast tri-d library, or can read a book from the library
included in the Entertainment Room. Finally, crew comfort and health will be
enhanced in the Fitness Room. A collection of various exercise machinery and
work-out areas provide the crew with yet another method for passing the long
hours of space travel.

Finally, the Ming comes equipped with a Quiptech Q010 Luxury Landing Craft.
During the negotiations and establishment of trade treaties, it is often
necessary for the mission leaders to conduct meeting of good-will on the
planet\'s surface.  The Q010 allows this to be done and at the same time
leave a good impression on the natives.  There are times, however, when a
stronger show is necessary, and at these times, the Ming itself can descend
to the surface of the world to leave a lasting impression with the locals.

No matter what conditions you expect, the Ming gives you the ability to
confront it with confidence.  In addition, the Ming provides a large cargo
area to increase profits and maintain that competitive edge.

Design notes:

The Ming was designed to work with the Grasshopper and the Cargo/Fuel
Modules.  The total displacement tonnage for all carried craft and the Ming
itself is 2500-tons.  The Jump Drive and Thruster Plates are designed with
this size in mind.

                           19.8 Length

Crew: 1 Maneuver, 1 Electronics

Notes:  The Modular Support Craft is equipped with three airlocks one for
normal entry, plus one per module.  The Craft uses the Standard Civilian
Electronics Package.  The area of the Docking Rings does not include Life
Support or Artificial Gravity/Inertial Compensation.  It is assumed to be
included in the module itself.  The Craft carries enough fuelto be used for
half a year.  The inclusion of an Emergency Low Berth allows the Craft to be
used as a lifeboat if necessary. Price listed includes two Cargo/Fuel
Modules.  Power Surplus: 5.571 Mw

Design notes:

Because I based this design on working with the Cargo/Fuel Module, I opted
not to extedn the LS and AG/IC throughout the hull.  I had some difficulty
within myself using three airlocks rather than a full year\'s worth of fuel,
but I felt the need for the airlocks was justified. I also don\'t like the
lack of cargo space, but I felt the potential of 5G\'s thrust was too much to
be passed up.  Of course, the pilot and sensor guy had better be strapped
into the seats when they kick in the thrust. :)

                              11.5 Length

Crew: (0.02 Maintenance for AG/IC)

Notes:  The 30-ton Cargo/Fuel Module is equipped with a 28.5-ton collapsible
fuel bladder to allow the module to be used for fuel storage as well as
standard cargo.  The Standard Life Support and Artificail Gravity/Inertial
Compensation Systems allow for storage of any type of cargo, from
refrigerated to live, but does require a 2.084Mw power source.
(Approximate Dimensions: 11.5m x 5.2m x 7.0m)
Fuel Bladder (19.95m^3 Storage Space)

Design Notes:

All ofthe items on the Cargo/Fuel Module are SSDS items with the exception
of the Collapsible Fuel Tank which is QSDS.  The grapples needed to use this
module on an existing hull require 126m^3 volume and 132.25m^2 surface area.
They cost 0.26MCr and mass 132.25 tonnes.

I would be happy if they would send me either the corrected or the

send them the front cover of FS, whatever it takes, but I want some M0 data
that is, if not correct, at least present.  I am perfectly willing to not

crippling data error (LAW=GOV) for every world is significant enough that

On a related note, are we ever going to see the deck plan for the Scout

The Ancients or rather the individuals that were Grandfather and his
children were different from oridinary Droyne, but only that they were
super intelligent and had very high psi. Grandfather was a genetic fluke
and he engineered his off spring to be so as well. Grandfather and his
offspring were unique.

Given all of the above, droyne researchers may well be attempting just
that. However Leaders may not like the idea of tampering with the gene pool
to create super INDEPENDANT Droyne. This would affect the whole fabric of
society effectively creating a new caste.

I also suspect that early on Grandfather altered the Droyne genome to
prevent this happening.

I think that reason Grandfather didn\'t use other proto-races for
experiments was their state of evolution. The aslan were pouncer carnivores
with little if any manipulation. Hivers were small starfish. At least we
were monkeys able to pick fleas off each other :-)

Yes please. This topic seems to come up every 6 months or so, do you 
have a web page you could stick it on? If not, I could put it on mine.

more functional.

What\'s a good solid Imperial Marine Cutlass like?  Heavier than the rapier,
keeps an edge through the Marines hitch.  Even when it\'s used to chop
firewood, or to pry the lids off wine crates.  Oh ya, it has to stay
looking good.  Is there an Imperial Sunburst on the bell guard, along with
the Unit insigna?

A crate of surplus Imperial Marine Cutlasses would be worth their weight in
gold (or any other material you want that they have) on a world with a TL
less than 4.  

Perhaps the cutlass a Marine receives when he musters out is an award.  Top
Marine NCO in the Battalion for that year.  Presented to officers who
complete the Advanced Ground Tactics course in the top quarter.  That sort
of thing.
These cutlasses would be engraved with the award, and perhaps the name and
unit of the owner.  The information would be on the blade or inside the
bell guard.

Amen! Well said!

I think in general, we TML\'s desire realism. But realism doesn\'t
necessarily entail slavishly limiting technological advances to only
what is feasible in the near future.

To me, realism is the building of a consistant framework that explains
the how and perhaps a bit of why future technology works the way it
does. As you say, the "HOW" is the most important to nail down in actual
published (dare I use the word?) canon. The "WHY" is less important, but
it makes for interesting discussion. Everyone knows I enjoy waving my
hands as much as the next guy, but any reasonably imaginitive GM can
come up with an interesting bit of "bullshittium".

That isn\'t to say putting out a supplement concentrating on the "WHY"
can\'t be useful. One of my favourite Traveller supplements dealt with a
lot of the WHY: The Starship Operator\'s Manual. It added depth and
detail to space travel.

But, as you say, consistancy is key. In the real world there are
sometimes conflicting theories to explain observed phenomena. But the
theories explain the observations, so the observations are more
important.

To tie this into the Canon debate, to me the important parts of
Traveller canon are the accepted "results". Sometimes its hard, because
sometimes different results pop up when someone is unaware of previous
information published.

For instance: Jump takes 1 week, in that one week you are unaffected by
events in realspace, and nothing can affect you. There are many ways of
explaining these results by using hyperspace concepts, alternate
dimensions, wormholes, or what have you.

Events in Traveller History are other important events, but they are a
*bit* more flexible. After all, history has been rewritten many times
here in the real world. But, the "Truth" published for the Referee\'s
eyes should remain consistant. That\'s why I worry about all this TL-15
second Imperium blundering.

So... Imperium Games needs to be aware of its history, in order to keep
current products consistant with previous assumptions and observations.
That way the Traveller Universe grows. Inconsistancy means part of the
universe "disappears". I think that\'s sad, because growth adds realism
and diversity, while deletion causes confusion and stagnation.

Crew Details: 3 cmd, 2 mvr, 3 elc, 5 gun, 1 scr, 6 eng, 2 crf,  2 trp, 1 
sci, 2 stw, 1 brk, 2 med	

NOTE:  I don\'t know how legal the "100 ton" shuttle bay is, and I haven\'t 
been able to work in the extra cost of the collapsible tankage <it\'s only 
about 1 MCr or so>, but here is my design, sans shuttle.

Starwerx Orbital Foundry is proud to present its first entry in the latest 
ISBA competition, the Nuphraitelle.  A medium sized, streamlined wedge 
hull, the Nuphraitelle is outfitted with a 2 parsec jump-drive and fuel for 
4 parsec\'s travel--2 in standard tankage and 2 in a pair of collapsible 
fuel bladders stowed in the middle cargo bay.

x--An interesting variant here would be a J-2x3 ship-add another pair of 
collapsible tanks, 400 dt fuel each, of course, in the cargo bay.  It\'d 
reduce the available cargo space by 42 dt, and there would only be ~250 std 
of cargo when the ship was fully tanked, but you\'d get another 2 parsecs 
out of the ship without refueling.

The philosophy with the Nuphraitelle is Opportunity, Capability, and 
Survival.

The Nuphraitelle\'s main sensor array, a Cassini Mk72 Survey package, is the 
standard among medium-sized Imperial Interstellar Scout Service vessels and 
gives the capability to survey uncharted or under-charted star systems. 
 The onboard laboratory lets the crew support a geophysical, xenobiological 
or astrophysical specialist to provide detailed analysis of the sensor 
data.

x--I chose the Survey sensor package because it _wasn\'t_ military.   The 
survey package has equal range, is nearly half the cost and price.  The 
only losing point is the larger volume.  Also, if the mission requires more 
Scientists, they get the High Passage cabins

Nearly half of the Nuphraitelle\'s volume is taken up by the three main 
cargo bays, each with a capacity of nearly 9000 cubic meters of storage, 
letting the Nuphraitelle haul impressive amounts of goods from the worlds 
it visits.

x--Okay, 8866.66 cubic meters-close enough for the glossy ads

Quarters for the crew, 10 middle passengers and 4 high passengers are 
standard, as are 10 low berths, suitable for passengers or livestock.  The 
Captain, of course, receives his own large stateroom.

The standard crew\'s complement, beyond the bridge crew and officers, 
includes 2 pilots for the small craft, 2 ship\'s troops for defense and 
security, a Science Officer, and a Broker specialist to aid the crew in 
matters of speculative trading.  2 Medical specialists and 2 Stewards round 
out the complement.

x--If more troops are required, they get the Middle Passage cabins.  The 
Broker is going to be the ship\'s \'Scout\' who will know all relevant 
information on culture and commerce at the places the ship will land.  I 
suppose this could be done by the Captain and 1st Officer if the ship were 
smaller.

Although the Nuphraitelle\'s thrusters are only capable of 1-gee 
acceleration, the structure of the ship has been designed to withstand 
twice that stress.  1-gee of contragravity and streamlining make 
atmospheric interface and flight safe on any world, terrestrial or 
gas-giant.  The Nuphraitelle\'s redundant wilderness fueling capability can 
scoop and purify a jump\'s worth of fuel in less than 6 hours.

x--The combined 2-gee acceleration from the thrusters and contragrav should 
get this whale off most planets.  The if one of the \'redundant\' fuel 
purifiers fails it takes 8.2 hours to process the scooped fuel.

Spacious hangers for two 50 ton shuttles have been provided, as well as 
more modest facilities for a 20 ton ship\'s boat.  The adjoining shuttle 
bays, with minor modifications, are capable being connected and berthing a 
100 ton J-2 scout.  The extra mission flexibility provided to the ship\'s 
crew in transporting cargo, passengers or handling emergency situations 
should prove invaluable.

x-Right now I\'m working on the deckplans for the Nephraitelle and I am 
leaning towards an \'under-and-over\' 50 std bay arrangement.  The deckplates 
between deck 3 and 4 would be removed and the bays connected that way.  Any 
comments anyone?

The Nuphraitelle is the first of Starwerx line of spacecraft and starships 
to feature "Mk3 systems automation," reducing the workload on the crew, but 
as with all Starwerx starships, redundant life-support and control systems 
are standard.  A Starwerx Mk8 \'Rambler\' class self defense package is 
included: 2 quad laser cannon, 2 sandcaster batteries, nuclear damper and 
meson screen.

x-I\'m going to run a scenario; a Newfy vs. some small, laser-armed vessels 
(pirates?  Fighters? Laser defensats?) and see how it performs.  I\'m pretty 
sure the only thing that will save her is her sandcasters.  I admit that 
the laser batts are a little weak, but this ship should be able to detect 
her foe and stay out of harms way before she should have to use them. 
 (BTW, if her batteries are combined, they\'re a respectable (+4) 1/6-4-3-2 
at a ROF of 100)

As the Nuphraitelle\'s mission profile includes long duration missions away 
from Class A and B starports, a machine shop, engineering shop and sickbay 
are present (including an emergency low berth for critically injured crew 
or passengers) .  If it should become necessary the shuttles and small 
craft should be capable of evacuating the entire ship\'s complement.

x-I hope this last point is never needed <evil grin>.  It would be horrible 
to have to abandon ship <evil grin> over some lost world with a thousand 
tons of cargo that you couldn\'t take with you <evil grin>.

As for the crewing, the jump drive, the thrusters/contragrav and the 
reactors take 2 engineers each (a senior/junior arrangement?).  The Survey 
sensor suite require 3 electronics types.  With the maintenance guy, that 
puts the ship\'s compliment at 10 in engineering/technical, 6 in 
gunnery/defense, 2 flight officers, and 3 in command.  Only 2 small craft 
pilots are included, but more may be required depending on the types of 
shuttles/ship\'s boats you use.

I hate to do this but.... OK I love it :)
If my memory seres me right, in one of the Challenge issues there is a
TNS entry about a rumored breakthrough in Jump technology at a
research station (RS). If I don\'t remember wrong the RS was in or near
Solomani Rim sector.

I\'l try to find it tomorrow, and give better reference.

The following is my limited knowledge of the situation and is only presented
because I\'m not sure if Joe Walsh will speak up, given that it\'s no longer
his responsibility to represent IG in this forum...

To answer you, not exactly. A soon-to-appear M0/FS combined book will have
32 extra pages including extra rules for creating more detailed law levels
(and the missing scout deckplan). This will "solve" the FS problem. To my
knowledge, there is no \'correct\' data, nor will there be any future
\'corrected\' data. In my personal opinion, the FS data is, er, (remembers
that he wants to continue writing for IG...) not very good.

As an aside, I thought I had been given permission to correct some parts of
it in the first part of The Long Way Home (yup, soon to be printed by IG!),
but unfortunately that was a misunderstanding, so the planetary statistics
in TLWH will have slightly different law levels and a couple of minor UWP
changes for the area in which it\'s set (no specifics - this isn\'t intended
to be a spoiler), compared to the FS data.

You can be assured that in the subsequent part, I\'ll stick strictly to FS
data which is totally accuuu... smeeeee...

It took me a minute to figure out what was tickling the back of my mind as
I read this -- you\'ve essentially reinvented the setup for Ian Banks\'
_Consider Phlebas_, IMHO one of the finest works of SF ever written.  This
and _Use of Weapons_ are must-reads for any Traveller GM or SF fan.

In _CP_, it\'s just one thinking machine involved, but other than that it\'s
a dead ringer.

	Yes, jump 6 is the currently achievable maximum. But Traveller has never 
detailed tech levels past 17, so who knows what jump level the Ancients 
were capable of?

	It stands to reason that since you can accidentaly misjump up to 36 
parsecs, that with some amount of technology you should be able to make 
controlled jumps of up to 36.

Thanks!  BTW, a MAJOR update coming shortly, I\'m breaking it up by Milleu
and incorporating a lot of material given to me by TML members...

I\'m also trying to get moved over to Microsoft Access, for better web pages.
I\'m still looking for another copy of Milleu Zero, which was "lifted" from
my gaming material quite recently...  Sigh.

4. Jump numbers correspond to the maximum number of parsecs (3.27 ly ea)
travelled in a single jump.

Parsecs are also refered to as \'hexes\' in Imperial society ;-)

True, true, true .... look at the Native Americans and the Europeans.

Unless both sides share the same guidelines for defining recognized
representatives, the Imperium is bound, psycho historically bound, to repeat
the events starting with 1492, Old Earth Calender.

   Nope.  At 99% of lightspeed, tau = cos(asin(0.99)) = 0.141, so the

   table:

   Yes.

   Beyond lightspeed, tau becomes imaginary (as in complex), not
   negative.  What happens at these speeds is that time becomes two
   dimensional, whatever that means.  Note, however, that there is no
   mechanical process that can make you reach lightspeed, so you can\'t
   go faster than light, except by the "fiction" part of "science
   fiction".

   -Rob

   PS, The "gamma" mentioned by other posters is equal to 1/tau, except
   in those post where it was inadvertantly used to mean tau.  To get
   the dialated time, you multiply the stationary time by tau, or divide
   it by gamma.

Contact: The Suerrat
Introduction & Biology

(c) 1997 Joseph L. "Chepe" Lockett
for eventual submission to IG\'s JTAS magazine
submitted to TML for your comments and discussion


Introduction:

	In the late 26th century pre-Imperial (c. 2000 AD Terran dating),
some Solomani biologists moved to extend the genus Homo to include their
local kin, such as Pan troglodytes, the chimpanzee.  Their effort might
be viewed as prelude to Solomani contact, some centuries later, with the
Suerrat: for, indeed, the natives of Ilelish bear as much similarity to
those primitive Terran relatives as to the more mainstream line which
found the stars and founded the Second and Third Imperia.  Whether these
similarities spring from a lost homid precursor, genetic manipulation by
the Ancient of pongid stock, or evolution in situ on Ilelish is at this
writing uncertain.  Suerrat are still members of genus Homo ("Homo
suerrensis" in taxonomic parlance), and interfertile with most other
varieties of humaniti, but the offspring of such unions are most often,
mule-like, sterile. 


Biology:

	Like almost all the minor races of humaniti, the Suerrat merely
ring changes on the familiar theme of the human frame, mostly determined
by differences in the homeworld.  Ilelish (Milieu 1100: 2907 E674983-A Hi
In 204) circles a type F4 V star at a distance of 2.8 AU, giving a local
year nearly four times the standard one (rotating every 16h29m15s, Ilelish
experiences it as over 2,120 local days: the Suerrat term for "year"
translates as "five-score scores [of days]").  Orbital eccentricity and
axial tilt are minimal, yielding a climate at temperate latitudes slightly
warmer (16 C) than Terran standard.  Land predominates slightly (55%) over
oceans, but the planet\'s rapid rotation and consequently vigorous weather
keep the continents well-watered -- vital for the health of the planet\'s
well-known jungles. 

	It was in those equatorial rain forests that the Suerrat people
evolved.  Ilelish is smaller than Earth (10,240 km in diameter), though
denser (1.08 standard): one would imagine its 0.86 g gravity field would
produce a tall, lithe people like the Zhodani.  But the arboreal existence
of the proto-Suerrat, tied to tree-tops, has kept them smaller in frame. 
As the accompanying illustration shows, Suerrat are short (1.6 m
average) but stocky (80 kg), with more muscle-mass per meter than either
Vilani or Solomani.  They are both dark in color (ranging from chocolate
to true ebony) and covered with fine, straight, dark hair to protect
against the short-wave radiation of their sun.  Suerrat seem bracycephalic
("broad-headed") to many humans, and have wider hips to compensate for the
corresponding difficulties in childbirth.  This wider foundation, tied to
their brachiating adaptations, gives Suerrat a kind of rolling "sailors\'
walk" that amuses some observers. 

	Suerrat arms are far longer in relation to their legs than for
most humans, since they remained brachiators, never descending to the
savannah but swinging from branch to branch above the forest floor.  And
that arboreal cradle has kept their feet fairly near their hands in flex-
ibility and utility: the hallux ("big toe") is fully opposable with the
nearest two digits.  Thanks to this tree-climbing inheritance, Suerrat
think quite comfortably in three dimensions, their vehicle and starship
positions make almost as much use of the feet as hands, and their
numbering system is "vigintisimal," base-20 (thus their place value
system proceeds from ones, to twenties (usually translated as "scores"),
to four-hundreds, to eight-thousands, and so on).  Suerrat find Imperial
citizens\' feet disgusting, and thus are often glad to be shielded from
them by our "odd" habit of wearing shoes. 

	As mentioned earlier, the Suerrat skull and facial features are
broader and flatter than many humans\'.  The harsh sun has led to their
eyes being somewhat deep-set, with notable brow ridges.  Eye color tends
towards the darker shades, brown and gray.  Though the nose is more
prominent, the sense of smell does not seem to be hyper-developed. 
Suerrat have 32 teeth in the standard Solomani dentition pattern: their
diet is thoroughly omnivorous, though they tend to be "snackers" rather
than relying on set meals.  The structure of the Suerrat skull and jaw
render their lips less flexible than many humans\', giving their language
its stereotypical "breathy" quality.  The language is largely free of
plosives (the so-called "Bronx," named by a Solomani linguistic
cataloger, being the single exception). 

	Ilelish\'s shorter day has produced a typical Suerrat sleep cycle
of 6 hours sleeping followed by 10 or 11 waking: they spend a slightly
higher fraction of their time asleep than the typical Solomani or
Vilani, and indeed find it difficult to adapt to the standard Imperial
24-hour cycle.  Normally they break it into two halves, each of 5 hours
sleep and 7 hours waking, but this pleases neither the Suerrat nor, all
too often, the Imperial manager acclimated to eight-hour shifts.  Perhaps
as a result of this shorter day, or perhaps as a chance cultural feature,
Suerrat tend to be far more impulsive and abrupt in their plans and
actions.  The civil-service bureaucracy under which they have lived for
much of their history is a deliberate and carefully-constructed attempt
to circumvent this racial hastiness, though the planet\'s low law level
also indicates the ease of arranging occasional "expediting."  The
system has served well in general, with the obvious and drastic exception
of the Ilelish Revolt.  Still, the dichotomy of a people ever urgent but
often sleeping has not been lost on many a would-be comedian. 

	One of the most major variations in the Suerrat physique, however,
is the total lack of the perpetually present of the sex drive that has
influenced so many human societies.  Instead, Suerrat females experience
estrus (receptivity to sexual reproduction) only about four times a
Suerrat year.  They signal this readiness with physiological changes:
increases in body fat in the secondary sexual characteristic (breasts
and buttocks), flushed skin (particularly in the genital area), and
release of pheremones to signal availability to Suerrat males.  If a
pregnancy occurs, gestation takes about nine standard months, almost
always resulting in a single birth (twins, let alone higher multiple
births, are exceedingly rare).  Estrus will typically then not re-occur
for about an Ilelish year (four standard).  But females not in estrus, and
males not in the presence of a ready female, are largely free of the
sexual awareness and energy which have charged the social development of
other human races. 

	Indeed, more conservative members of Suerrat society often find
Imperials\' constant awareness of and receptivity to sex organs and
activities rather disgusting.  However, a fair fraction (about one-third)
of Suerrat males are capable of detecting the constant "estrus" state of
Imperial women, and thus find them both fascinating and arousing.  Such
cases can prove diplomatically embarassing, since the Suerrat thus
sometimes prove "all hands" in more ways than one!

	Of course, prostitutes in Suerrat society do often take various
substances to induce estrus-like states and thus encourage clients.  And
females serving in military or other regimented institutions will often
dose themselves to completely prevent estrus.  But the limited presence of
sex and sex signals in Suerrat society causes important differences from
the Imperial model.  Equality of the sexes came far sooner to Ilelish than
to many human worlds and cultures, and the motivation for a whole span of
personal crimes is absent.  Suerrat treat clothing as functional more than
moral, another way in which many human societies strike them as odd.

History -- Beginnings and Ziru Sirka

History:

Beginnings:

	The Ancient installation which introduced and nurtured the
proto-Suerrat on Ilelish was located in that planet\'s heavy equatorial
jungles, the environment which has shaped the species ever since.  Luckily
for the Suerrat themselves, the Ancients there were killed not by the
typical planet-wracking catastrophe of asteroid bombardment or other heavy
weapons fire, but, as far as evidence indicates, a virulent plague which
rapidly snuffed out all Ancient personnel.  The fast-growing jungle did
much of the work in destroying the base itself, such that it was not until
fairly late in Suerrat history that they themselves discovered evidence of
earlier visitors.  That very evidence, though, was what catapulted the
race starward. 

	Large carnivores roamed the ground and low levels of Ilelish\'s
rain forests, and so the proto-Suerrat, whether by accident or design,
found their homes in the forest canopy.  Those fearsome beasts, though,
met the same fate as the "megafauna" on many another human-inhabited
world: the twin discoveries of technology and tactics soon rendered the
beasts extinct outside of fairy-tales, and the Suerrat themselves assumed
the top position of the food pyramid.  Hunting bands soon coalesced into
tribes, tribes into peoples.  Agriculture developed, first as primitive
cultivation of fruit-trees and air-plants, then as full-scale field
cultivation in muddy river deltas and at the forest margins, for the
Suerrat themselves remained a people of the jungle. 

	But jungles can prove far more vulnerable to environmental insult
than other biomes, as many human races have found to their sorrow.  And
so, in -9540 Imperial, when the power and potential of the Industrial
Revolution began to become apparent on Ilelish despite its dangers, the
ruling Council of All Trees (a sort of United Nations for the then
medieval-level Suerrat) forced a move of most such operations outside the
jungles and surrounding fields, ultimately to the planet\'s temperate
regions.  Rapidly the equatorial regions of the planet became the seat of
the race\'s wealthy capitalists and governmental institutions, while the
"middle class" gravitated to the more economically (if not climatically) 
hospitable temperate and even arctic zones.

	As the planet\'s demographic patterns shifted and the comfortable
jungles emptied out (apart from the occasional invasion or other uprooting
of government), many of the remaining idle rich began to practice their
hobbies, or employ others to practice hobbies for them.  Many sciences
began to catch up with the industry the impulsive Suerrat had produced,
and the science of archaeology found its first opportunities in the
now-open original homelands of the race.  Imagine their surprise when
they unearthed fragments of the Ancient installation, still sturdy after
hundreds of millenia.  It was impossible to determine who the folk were
who had built the facility, but it soon became evident that these
non-humans, whoever they were, came from beyond the planet itself.  Those
same equatorial lands soon spawned rocketports, and probes and manned
expeditions soon investigated Ilelish\'s satellites and neighbors in the
system.  The arboreal Ilelish adapted well to low- and zero-gee
operations, and soon much industry had moved off-planet. 

	Further fragments of Ancient occupation on other worlds in the
system indicated that the mysterious Visitors came from beyond the system. 
And so, in -8939 Imperial, the first slower-than-light probe departed for
the Ullaresh system, one parsec away.  Decades later word came that it had
found a habitable planet, and the race was on.  Generation ships departed,
forced by their very size to travel slower than the probes, to carry eager
colonists to the new worlds.  By -8600 Imperial the Suerrat had colonized
every habitable planet within five parsecs, and Suerrat industries and
space colonies were developing the others.  More evidence of the Visitors
turned up here and there, but no definite evidence to point the race in
any specific direction. 


Vilani Contact, and Conquest:

	Of course, by -8900 the infant Vilani economic sphere had reached
five parsecs in radius, and their explorations had extended sixty parsecs
from home, nearly touching the coreward border of what is now Ilelish
sector.  In short order, in -8564, Vilani merchant/scouts contacted the
small interstellar polity held by the Suerrat.  The Vilani had encountered
the Geonee some centuries earlier, but a meeting with yet another human
race with interstellar holdings still startled them.  They were
simultaneously astonished and relieved to find that this expansion had
taken place wholly without jump drive.  Eventually, of course, some Vilani
merchant sold the Suerrat the plans for the jump-1 drive, and the next era
of Suerrat expansion began. 

	For nearly three millenia the Suerrat then had their corner of
space, nestled in the arm of the Great Rift, entirely to themselves.
Scores of worlds were settled as the jump drive extended Suerrat territory
some ten to thirty parsecs from the homeworld.  By -6000 the Vilani had
assembled an economic sphere sixty parsecs in radius, bringing the
holdings of the Naasirka bureau a good three-quarters of the way through
what are now Gushemege and Dagudashag sectors.  Vilani scouts and
merchants from Sharurshid, particularly those engaged in lucrative trade
with the Geonee and the other minor races that bureau had discovered, ran
trailing of the Suerrat worlds into Zarushagar.  But Ilelish and Verge
sectors, limited as they were by the Great Rift, and much of the three
Vilani sectors the bureaux had not yet developed, were the Suerrat
playground.

	Sharurshid\'s rampant expansion galled some of the more ambitious
Naasirka corporate lords, and they began to feed hemmed in: to trailing by
that companionable competitor, to coreward by the Vilani home worlds, to
spinward by the trackless Great Rift... and to rimward by the Suerrat
dominion.  Conflicts erupted between the two sides over trading rights,
technology patents, allegations of piracy, and, finally, the Suerrat
desire to obtain the new jump-2 drive used by Vilani military and
government vessels.  Naasirka whole-heartedly supported the initiation of
the Consolidation Wars in -5400, and Vilani forces steam-rollered into
Suerrat space.  The initial war lasted for two centuries, with regular
flare-ups throughout the Consolidation Wars period (which lasted until
- -4045). 

	Naasirka made up for lost time and space with a vengeance: the
Suerrat of Gushemege and Dagudashag were ruthlessly exterminated, their
colonies uprooted and replaced with Vilani homes and businesses.  Much of
Ilelish sector itself was "cleansed," and it was only the efforts of
Sharurshid, perhaps, that preserved the Suerrat people from utter
extinction.  In -5013, that bureau insisted on, and received, an
extension of the bureaux-neutral space that gave all three gov-
ernment-corporations access to lucrative areas of the proto-Ziru-Sirka
(the core worlds, the long passage to Mendan, the fertile worlds around
Sylea, and the many minor human homeworlds rimward) to include the
long-developed and lucrative worlds of the Suerrat home cluster.  In re-
turn, to allow for Naasirka expansion, Sharurshid gave up areas of space
around Mika (Antares) and in rimward Mikadira (Old Expanses), in the
so-called "Bright Star Exchange".  [See the map on p. 11 of "Vilani &
Vargr" to see the resulting distributions of space.]  Of course, the
virtual end to Vilani exploration in -4045 put an end to even those small
windows for Naasirka.  The Suerrat of Ilelish subsector and a scant few
other worlds were spared -- but they would never forget the worlds that
had once been theirs. 

	The Suerrat suffered under the Vilani yoke for over 1500 years. 
The technology permitted them was harshly restricted.  The unique
foodstuffs of the Ilelish rainforest which had nourished the Suerrat
people were harvested by Naasirka for luxury exports.  Sharurshid\'s
seeming act of kindness revealed itself purely as a calculated business
move, to allow access to Ilelish lumber, minerals, and cultural products. 
Vilani overseers, obsessed as ever on efficiency, worked their factories
on their own 32-hour day with its own set of incompatibilities to the
Suerrat circadian rhythm.  The Vilani caste system grated, too, on the
traditionally free-wheeling Suerrat.  The Vilani stereotype of the "lazy
Suerrat" dates largely from the friction of this period.  Even as the
Ziru Sirka decayed into civil wars and provincial revolts, control over
the Suerrat remained rigid: with the border poised on the very edge of the
Great Rift, no worlds remained beyond to support insurrections.

	And then, in -2220, the Solomani arrived.

Agreed, I ignored these because there all pretty unexplainable
compared to wormholes and Alcubierre warps.  Atleast these have *some*
foundation in our current level of science/Tech knowledge and ability.

I am reading his paper at the momment, so can not comment on it.  I am
aware that his work has been touted as a possibility for all us sci-fi
buffs:)

True, I get the impression though that they are "fairly" common (I
hesitate to use that word).  So the problem comes down to being able to
locate, stabilise and manipulate them.

Also, I have heard that it *could* be possible for a highly advanced
Civilisation to pull a wormhole out of the quantum foam of space.  Once
again, higly theoritical, there all *maybes*, but atleast there are
*maybe*, the system currently in use in Traveller is a no-way at our
current level of understanding.

Nature abhores time machines.  I think Hawking\'s said that.  Its true that
you can use a wormhole to make a time machine, of course not in the Dr. 
Who sense, but a Time Machine none the less.  It is  also likely (and I
tend to agree) that the moment a wormhole becomes a time machine, it will
destroy itself.  This way we get no unsolvable parradox.

Is Forward\'s book for laymen? - I am not a physicist, so will have
difficulty reading it if it\'s written for physicists.

Thats fair enougth, but if I have Traveller\'s jump field concept on one
side and the wormhole *theory* on the other, I would rather go with
wormholes.

Thats way I raised the whole idea on TML, I wanted a reality check, I
wanted people like you to try and debunk wormholes or defend the Traveller
system to really test the wormhole idea.  Thanks.

    'body' => 'Aurelia Downport, Sylea (Sylean News Service) - Aurelian Industries, a
privately-held shipbuilding concern headquartered in the Wardn barony of
Sylea, today unveiled its entry into the current THUDDD competition for a
new type-standardized Exploratory Merchant Ship class.  The Cristobal Colon
class Exploratory Cruiser, Mercantile (ECM) continues the Aurelian
Industries tradition of innovative solutions for complex starship problems.

At first glance, the Cristobal appears to be little more than a reworked
version of the famous Aurelian Industries Marco Polo class long-range scout
ship.  While the two ships share many features and components, the two
classes are quite different.  The Cristobal carries enough room for
corporate researchers or troubleshooters, as well as passengers, but still
has room for nearly 200 tons of cargo.  The potentially-threatening heavy
wepaonry of the Marco Polo has been downgraded to a less-intimidating
defensive suite, which still gives the Cristobal the firepower it needs to
discourage trouble before it happens.  The defenses of the Marco Polo are
largely retained, and special dispensation has allowed Aurelian Industries
to mount a Meson Screen on the Cristobal.  While not proof against relic
Meson attacks, the screen will allow the ship to quickly remove itself from
danger, without adversely impacting the final cost of the vessel.

The interior of the Cristobal is also a far cry from the Marco Polo.  While
Imperial Navy and Scout Service crews are used to tight quarters, Aurelian
Industries realizes that the well-paid professionals of today\'s merchant
marine need a certain level of comfort to be able to perform well and make
their companies prosper.  For this reason, each crewman is allocated his
own stateroom.  Additional entertainment facilities, in the form of two
10-ton lounges, have also been added to the ship to maintain morale during
long voyages of market discovery.

The realities of these long journeys require that the Cristobal be as
self-supporting as possible.  For that reason, the vessel is equipped with
many additional facilities.  A machine shop, equipped with the finest
high-tech Imperial tools, can fabricate nearly any part the vessel may
need, allowing the ship to perform major repairs (short of an overhaul)
without the services of a starport.  The human element also needs to be
maintained, which is why the Cristobal is equipped with two
fully-functional sickbays.  There are also 20 low berths on board, which
can be used to carry replacement crew or passengers, or reserved for
wounded crew whose injuries cannot be tended to with the ship\'s facilities
(an unlikely possibility).

There is also provision for up to 20 Mission Specialists to be carried on
the Cristobal; expert economic analysts and trade negotiators who can make
the difference between a successful expedition or a failed one.  When
making followup visits to an already-explored region, these rooms can be
used to carry 20 high passengers instead, or even 40 medium passengers.
Similarly, accomodations are provided for 12 security specialists to guard
against treachery by newly-contacted customers, and to provide internal
order during a long voyage.  Again, when making followup visits to an
already-explored region, these rooms can be used to carry 12 high
passengers instead, or even 24 medium passengers.

Like the Marco Polo, the Cristobal has two separate hangars for 30-ton
Ship\'s Boats.  These craft can be used for landings, system exploration or
even (given enough time) wilderness refueling of the mother ship.  The
Ship\'s Boats are not provided, but can be easily obtained from many fine
small-craft manufacturers.  Any vessel of 30 tons or less can be used, or
any combination totalling 30 tons, for each of the two hangars.  In
addition, with the Ship\'s Boat away on a mission either of the hangars can
be used as impromptu meeting areas for large meetings or other ceremonies,
or even for a pickup game of Grav Ball.

While the Marco Polo carries external grapples for six 100-ton Scout Ships,
the Cristobal carries three 200-ton grapples.  These grapples can be used
for any vessel of 200 tons or less, and the ship\'s drives and fuel loads
are optimized to handle the ship\'s mass (2000 tons) plus the mass of up to
600 tons of carried vessels.  Aurelian Industries also provides two
complementary auxillary craft to fill these 200-ton holes; the Amerigo
Vespucci class Auxilliary Far Trader, and the Santo Domingo class
Auxilliary Cargo Carrier.

Based on the same 200-ton streamlined box hull, the Amerigo and the Santo
both extend the cargo capacity of the Cristobal, and allow the exploration
team leader a wider range of exploration options.  With the jump-2 Amerigo,
the team leader can widen his exploration area quickly, covering an entire
cluster of worlds in one third the time a normal exploratory cruiser would
require.  With the Santo, the team leader is able to pick up and deliver
more cargo to a world\'s surface, or even refuel his mother ship more
quickly.  The auxilliary vessels are optional, but provide a set of much
more flexible and powerful exploratory options.  The auxilliaries can also
be easily upgraded with military-quality sensors and even weapons systems,
for those regions of space where pirates and other dangers make firepower
an important trading tool.

I didn\'t like Virus either, but here\'s an interesting way to look at 
it.

You know, Traveller has some of its roots in Asimov\'s Foundation 
series.  If you haven\'t read that, the main subject of the series is 
the stellar empire, and we watch it crest and fall over several 
thousand years.

We don\'t even follow one character throughout.  We follow the ages of 
the empire.

And in the series, the empire is great.  Then, we read another 
section of the book, and the empire falls some years later.

Even the first emperor in the book was called Cleon.

Given this, you can think of the Virus era as just like what happens 
in the book.

I bet the phoenix will rise from the flame somewhere down the road.

   Nope.  Canon is a greek word meaning measuring stick, in particular,
   a measuring stick by which other measuring sticks are compared.  The
   length of the canon may be arbitrary, but the point is that it makes
   a standard for comparison.  The word is today somewhat obscure, and
   is currently used mainly in ecclesiastical, literary, and
   mathematical circles.  When computer programmers use the word
   "standard" as a noun, they are talking about a canon.  In English,
   the words standard and canonical have almost identical meanings.

   The list of books making up any codex which wants to call itself a
   "Bible" is a canon.  The ecclesiastical laws which do not vary from
   diocese to diocese are called canon laws.  The list of works that all
   scholars agree to be written by Shakespear is a canon.  And, most
   relevant to this list, any body of work that a Trav author wants to
   be consistent with is a canon.

   Obviously, a canon is good for some things and not good for others. 
   Whenever you have issues of cross compatability and self consistency,
   canon becomes important.  Where such issues are missing, canon is of
   no importance, except, perhaps, to the excessively tidy-minded.

   I\'m being meticulous about this because, every once in a while on this
   list, the word canon seems to pick up a perjorative sense for some
   reason.

   When the word canon was first used on this list many years ago, its
   user gave it a definition: any of the history or background published
   by GDW.  It was an issue way back then, because much of DGP\'s "new"
   stuff was difficult to reconcile with what came before.  Now, canon
   is a hot issue once again because much of the new T4 stuff
   contradicts what DGP has produced.  (Though none of it contradicts
   the old GDW, final-edition, little black books, as far as I can see.) 
   Pure speculation: I think that the reason for this MAY be that Marc
   Miller was not involved in much of the DGP (or TNE) work, and may not
   know or care much about it.  But perhaps I\'m just projecting my own
   views onto our quiet author. 8^)

   The issue of canon is not whether something is right or wrong, but
   whether it is consistent with something or not.  If someone tells you
   that an adventure, or ship design system, or historical essay you
   wrote violates canon, he is not damning you.  He is making an
   objective statement about the compatability of your work with what is
   widely accepted.  Whether this objective statement is relevant or not
   is another issue.

   The whole point to having a canon, of course, is so we don\'t have to
   work it all out every time a new rule-book is made.  It\'s a time and
   effort saving convention.

   Well, you seem to be confusing orthodoxy with canon; they are two
   different things.  But besides this semantic quibble, I have a
   problem with what you seem to be saying: "I can work at Trav as hard
   as I want, and you can work at Trav as hard as I want.  Deal?"

   No deal!

Neat! I downloaded Mr. Porters CORPS in a nutshell from the BRTC website 
and found his combat system intriguing... especially since I also 
recently purchased 3G3. I\'m disappointed in the "coarseness" of Traveller 
weaponry. I mean, with damage ratings maxing out at 3, and very few range 
bands, that doesn\'t leave much room for variety.

One thing that confused me in the 4-page CORPS summary was the 
distinction between "lethal" and "non-lethal" damage. What\'s the 
definition? Is all firearm damage "lethal"? Is all melee damage 
"non-lethal", or is it "lethal" if a blade is used?

Every once in a while, I buy something brand new and feel completely good

Good plan; every consumer should seek out information about the item 
under consideration before making an actual purchase.  I don\'t know how 
many times I\'ve bought something only to find out that not only am I 
disappointed, but there are tons of people who got burned as well, and 
who would have been happy to warn me off the product before-hand. 

\'Course, any time you receive such information, you have to take into 
consideration who is giving it to you.  Each of us has our own biases, 
etc. 

But, to get back to the pricing issue, comparing substitute items to the 
price of RPGs over their useful lifetimes shows me that we\'re getting a 
heck of a deal, really (not that I won\'t always want lower prices<G>), on 
RPG\'s in general.  F\'rinstance, a Super Nintendo cart is quite expensive 
- - darned near $100 a pop.  A computer game will run you $40 to $80 bucks, 
until it hits the bargain bins.  And in both cases, the amount of time 
you spend with them _tends_ to be less than with an RPG you really like 
(I say _tends_ because there are exceptions, of coruse; heck, I\'ve played 
_Star Raiders_ for hundreds and hundreds of hours over the years).  

As a counter-example, there\'s always paper back books. They\'re still 
relatively inexpensive, and you can read them again and again and again.  
But, they\'re rarely as enjoyable for as many hours as a good RPG.

\'Course, if you\'re one of the folks that feels it necessary to buy every 
supplement for Traveller no matter whether you feel its content will be 
useful in your own sessions (not to mention those of us who buy two or 
three copies of each supplement), RPG\'s become much less of a good buy. =)

The Three Laws of Thermodynamics

1.  You can\'t get ahead 

    You can\'t build a system with more output than input. You can\'t
    get something for nothing.

2.  You can\'t break even

    You can\'t build a system which has no losses or other wastes.

3.  The first two rules apply everywhere.

The problem with steam is that at its most efficient you get about a 50%
loss in energy.  I think really huge trubines can push this down to 30% or
25% energy loss, but your not going to have this on any but the largest
vessels.

Actually was it not ASIMOV who stated that a sufficiently advanced

Okay, I hear what your saying and thats fine - each to their own - I was
just curious if it bothered anyone else.  I think the beuty of a game can
also come from looking at what we know and can do now and projecting
that into the future - with zero or minimal hand waving.  I think many
people would be *amazed* at what research is being done and just how much
we *do* know about the working\'s of the Univerese.  I have always found
fact to be more exciting then fiction.

All in all Traveller is good at this, most current sci-fi, both television
and novel based seems to be using more and more \'magic\' I just hope
Traveller does not go the same way.

As a side note, Bruce did you ever get the picture of the \'27\' I sent you?

True - but there are alternate theorys of FTL travel which seemed to be

:)

I disagree somewhat - I think the transition between a caveman (or
Egyptian) to modern day would cause the Exclaimation "Ayup Im in God
land", but I think the jump between a modern man (late 20th C.)to a
thousand years in future will not be as great a shock to the system
as compared to your Egyptian.

The reason I say this is that I can definetly imagine stunning
breakthrough\'s in area\'s we do not currently fully understand - but
generally only in area\'s we already atleast have an inclining of.

I would also suspect that completely unheard of ideas and methods would
also be discovered and used, but these would be far and few between.

For instance, Vacuum Energy would not surprise me, nor would inertialess
drives, or FTL travel in some form.  All these things we have a shadow of
an understanding off, or atleats dream about - so for me to be hurtled
into the 30th Century and find these are now reality\'s, there would be
amazement, but I would not think it was magic.

I am probably not explaining myself very well, but hopefully you\'ll see
through the waffle and glimpse what I am *trying* to say.

The rest of what you said I have no particular disagreement with, so I
snipped it out.

Actually your correct in one sense, but wrong in another - using the
following definition for FTL travel;

You have two points, starting point is (A) finishing point is (B).  The
moment a ship leaves point (a) heading for point (b) I send a beam of
light from a to b.  If the vessel arrives before the beam of light arrives
then I *have* travlled faster then the speed of light.

We are pretty sure that there is a Light Barrier (can not go faster then
light), therefore to go faster then light, another method must found.  An
accepted method is using a problembistic idea know has "hyperspace" wher
the vehicles leaves our Universe and therefor is not *bound* by the laws
of our Universe, ie not bound by the Speed of Light Barrier.

I am also sure you would be amazed at how much research *has* been done on
this Barrier, FTL and wormholes - dating all the way back to the 30\'s.  So
there *is* a body of knowledge.

Sorry, wrong again :)  Neither Blackholes or Wormholes have been observed,
so how can you be si sure that one exists but the other does not?  I can
be sure that both exist because of the Laws Of Physics.  Wormholes were
discovered mathematically in 1916 as a solution to Eiensteins field
equation.  They have been researched extensively since the 1950\'s (mostly
by Wheeler and his group) and, like Black Holes have been *mathematically*
proven to exist.

The problem with Womrholes is that they are *highly* unstable and extremly
tiny.  My supposition is that a highly advanced civilisation, like those
in the Traveller Universe, can stabilise them and manipulate them for
intersteller travel.

Your explanation (below) is excellent, I quite like it and i hope you wont
mind if I incorporate *parts* of it into my own Traveller Universe and my
own Jumpgate/Drive wormhole TAS entries?


I have not gotten rid of the Jump Drive, but I have heavily modified it -
a Jump Drive equiped ship basically acrrie its own Gate for transportaion,
only higly advanced civilisations or extremely large, usually
experimental,  vessel carry such one sided gate\'s.

Once I have put together the TAS entries, and I am happy with them I will
post them to TML.

Now onto specific comments ...

Ahh excellent I like this.  Theoritically Wormholes can be of any length,
which could mean that you could get a Jump -20 or higher, which I did not
like.  I think I will use your idea to continue to limit them to 6
parsecs, making them easier to meld into the current Traveller Universe.

Good, you solved another problem of wormholes I have had as it pertains to
"melding" them with current Traveller canon.  The time it takes to travel
a wormhole in "reality" is the time it takes to travel the tunnel\'s length
in the real Universe.  For instance if the tunnel was 20km long, then it
would take you as long to get through the tunnel as it would in space to
travel 20KM. BUT I much rather your explanation.

I disagree.  I like Stargates so I use them.  This way your average
trader has a lot mor room because he doesn not carry any jump drives.  
The government who maintains the gate makes money from tolls, and only
exceptionally advanced or large *military* vessels have Jump Drives to
allow extra maneuverability.

major races.

	No doubt. But that wasn\'t "across the continent" ... you\'re quite a bit
further away, and outside the US to boot (parallel: shipping from the
Imperium to the Zhodani Consulate probably wouldn\'t be restricted to Cr1000
per disp ton).

	Besides, all of this ignores the real reason the trade rules are set up
the way they are... they were written for player characters in a tramp free
trader, not to model megacorps, shipping lines, or the internal economy of
the Imperium. Marc didn\'t WANT players to be able to break even doing
simple shipping; that\'s boring. They have to take risks, hence the
speculative trade rules.

	Actually, it means the grapples have to be MUCH stronger, there\'s a great
deal of force applied to both the grapple and the base of the small craft
during even normal acceleration, much less evasion, and there are likely to
be some serious bending moments on the small craft. So it is somewhat of a
problem.

I am sure it will, but how many times will it rise from the flames?  In
Foundation the Empire collapsed once.  The whole collapse was so
phenominal that even with the aide of technical wizards and psionic
masters the dark ages would still last a thousand years.  After the
re-emergence of the Empire, in the Foundation mould, the whole Galaxy is
colonisied by this stage, and the Humans start to wonder about
intrusions from other Galaxy\'s.

So, I take your point and its a good one, but there\'s not that much cross
over between the two.  I would rather that there was the Traveller
Universe, well documented and sourced and then each Game Master changes it
how ever he/she likes - more like the Dungeons and Dragons mould.  Though
I find the Traveller history intriguing, I would rather that all the
energy spent on that sort of stuff was re-focused on making excellent "the
be all and end all" Traveller source book.  Modifications and additions
can come from Modules and TAS articles etc.

I\'m recommending CORPS to anyone who is interested in a great rules-light
system. It really is the system I\'ve been looking for all these years.
(When I told my wife this, she surveyed the shelves of Traveller and GURPS
books and managed to contain her joy at the end of my quest.)

Lethal is cutting/penetrating damage (knife wounds, gunshots, etc.) it has
the potential to kill you, using the eventualy fatal and instant kill
rolls.  Non\'lethal is a punch in the jaw.. very hard to kill somebody, but
you can knock them cold.

Black holes have been observed by the HST, one at the center of a galaxy
apparently has a mass several hundred *billion* times that of the sun.
Cygnuss X-1 has been observed for many years, and was recently confirmed to
be a black hole.

Wormholes, have not been observed.  While mathematically feasible, until
one is found, the remain a matter of conjecture.

GURPS Space, 2300AD, MechWarrior.  There are games out there that take a
very hard science, no hand waving approach to space flight.  Hell, one of
the best resources I own is Cyperpunk\'s Deep Space book.  The important
difference is, they are not Traveller, which is what is being discussed on
this list.

Traveller is jump drives, artificial gravity, thruster plates and HepLar,
all tyhese things that have grown up arounf the game for twenty years.
Changing or removing one of these basics invalidates one of the most
engaging and detailed science fiction settings I know of.

I love it when anybody attempts to predict what the future will be like.
We could keep growing by leaps and bounds technologically until we reach
the point where I can be uploaded into an interstellar probe and sent to
seed the universe with copies of myself, or we could hit a ceiling in the
next twenty years, and stay there for centuries waiting for the next
pivitol breakthrough.

>All in all Traveller is good at this, most current sci-fi, both television

>Traveller does not go the same way.

Clarke\'s Law.  Take my computer back to Aloan Turing in the late 1940s.  He
won\'t beleive what he\'s seeing with his own two eyes.  Show Henry Ford tape
of the Indianapolois 500.. He\'ll goggle at the very idea.  Ever single
piece of technology was magic and fantasy until somebody invented it.  The
magic cave of Ali Baba?  A voice-pattern lock key to a correct phrase..
common place nowadays.  *I\'ve* been cured of a disease that as little as 30
years ago was not treatable!  A turn of the century doctor would call that
a miracle!

So who\'s to say that next year some bright grad student won\'t crack the
secret of anti-grav or cheap fusion?  If they do, our children and
grandchildren will just accept it.  Of course cars fly!  Why wouldn\'t they?
 This is the same level of acceptance that my niece shows towards
spaceflight, something that Craig and I are just old enough to still find
amazing.

Because jump drive works.  It is the only known method IN THE TRAVELLER
UNIVERSE to travel FTL.  Try GURPS.. Space and Vehicles 2nd Ed have a
number of different ways to get around.

Really?  Take a man from San Francisco, circa 1930.  Trnasfer him to SF in
1997.  With the city crowded with skyscrapers, an artificial island in the
bay, bridges all over the place, a black mayor, homosexuals everywhere,
700,000 people crammed into our tiny little town, hundreds of thousands of
cars, women working.. he\'d die of culture shock before you\'d even be able
to introduce him to the technology

Vulcanized rubber, one of the most basic items in our life, was discovered
by accident.  As was penicillin, the glue on post-it notes, and a host of
other things.  Serendipity tends to lead to more breakthroughs than basic
research it seems.

How about if you were offered a new body?  By definition, you couldn\'t be
surprised by something you expected.  My man of 1930 above couldn\'t have
expect to find a black man running the city, it was unthinkable in his
time, and he had no reason to believe things would ever change.

Here\'s an interesting note on T4 prices that I was glad to see.  One 
of my players recently took my advice and went out an bought the EA.  
I went with him, because we were hanging out together that day, and 
his girlfriend was out of town for Mother\'s Day.

We went to the SAME store to buy his copy of the EA that I bought 
mine at--and guess what!!!!

The damn thing was $2.50 cheaper.  All of the T4 stuff had been 
marked down.  All of the $22.50 supplements are now $20.00 at that 
store.

Even the main book was marked down.  

I\'m not sure if this was something the store did, or if IG is 
scaling back prices or offering dealer rebates or what.

All I know is that this is a good thing.

I don\'t agree with your implication in the above statement.

There\'s many different kinds of FTL ideas in Science Fiction. Each author 
or creator of Science Fiction chooses a method, and develops how it works 
and its affects on the denizens of his or her universe. It is my humble 
opinion, that it is best *not* to mix too many different methods of FTL 
travel when creating a sci-fi background. It is better to concentrate on 
one "vision" of how FTL travel works, and stick to it. Consistancy, 
consistancy, consistancy.

So alternate theories of FTL travel haven\'t been "overlooked". Marc 
decided hyperspace (ie. jumpspace) was the way to go for TRAVELLER, and 
he stuck to it. He, or someone else, decided that Stutterwarp was the way 
to go for 2300AD, so that was the method used there, and it had different 
implications for that universe.

I do *not* want Imperium Games to officially invalidate jump-drives and 
how they work. If _you_ choose to model other ways of interstellar 
travel, go ahead, but don\'t say to me that the Traveller way is "wrong".

BTW, if you haven\'t yet, you should check out the Relativity and FTL 
Travel FAQ at

hmmm, what is your source for this information?  I just pulled a source
out now (dated 1993, so it could easily be dated) and I quote;

"I have never seen a black hole .. no one has.  Astronomers have found
only indirect evidence for the existence of black holes and *no*
observational evidence for the existence of black holes."

See the thing about black holes is that they are black, and the thing
about space is that, well, its black too - so its hard finding the little
(or giant) suckers.

Agreed, I never said otherwise - BUT I would rather "mathematically
feasible" (which is incorrect, should read "mathematically PROVED") and
"conjecture" over complete fantasy and lots of hand waving (RE: Jump
Drives).

There are limits though.  Making stuff up that completely violates our
current understanding of the universe belongs in D&D,  sci-fi should be
*atleast* bound by the Laws we have already discovered.

I see what your saying, but something "amazing" as opposed to calling
something "god like" is a different ball park.  Also, how can you speak
for anyone at all?  Did you know Mr. Ford personally? Knew his views on
what the car would become? I doubt it.

After the initial *surprise* he may sit down and say, "hey, I should of
expected this".  Then he may not - whos to say.

All I am saying is that the jump between a caveman and a modern man, I
*believe* would be much greater than modern man to thousand years in the
future.  Where a cave man would find electricity inconceivable, a modern
man would not find Vacuum Energy inconceivable (depending on his
education of course)

The reason? Our general everday understanding of the Universe has
increased a thousand fold when compared to primitive mans understanding.

They wont be discovered *if* they violate the rules of the universe.  So
either the rules are wrong, or the discovery is impossible - I would like
to think the rules are right, or very close to right at this point in
time.

So?  If we discover that the method Traveller uses is wrong, completely
foundless, but an alternative will *probably* work given the right
technology level, would you still stick with the Traveller Jump Drives?

That is my point.

I was not talking about culture, not at all - I was comparing
technological differences, in which case Mr1930 would be more comfortable

No I wouldnt be *shocked* I wouldnt be so stunned by the revelation that
humans can now transplant minds to new bodys that I would consider it the
realm of the gods.   Surprised of course, but no so surprised I could not
cope with it.

Don\'t start this until I can join you! (My current campaign -- running 
about once a year since 1989 -- follows some nightmarish conspiracies 
during the Fifth Frontier War.)

>I\'m wondering how many of us actually play strictly canonical (rules and

I think of the background side of my current campaign as largely 
within canon.  Every item of background published by GDW or DGP up 
to 1107 is probably true.  For example, issues of Challenge and 
Travellers\' Digest give descriptions of worlds in the Spinward 
Marches.  I generally use these.  On top of that are the things that 
I\'ve made up, like an addictive psionic inducer drug being distributed 
during the war, and the presence of an Ancient weapon largely modelled 
on the Doomsday Weapon from Star Trek.  Those aren\'t inconsistent with 
canon to the extent that they disagree with anything already published.  
The history of the Kforuzeng is a little different than canon, but 
that\'s not a major part of canon nor of the campaign.  

Regarding the rules, my campaigns -- and my playing -- focus primarily 
on role-playing. I like the task system in MT (maybe because I\'ve used 
it for a long time), and use it largely as instructed.  It has about the 
right level of detail for the campaign and the primary player.  I don\'t 
so much have house rules as a willingness to make decisions as a referee, 
and my players respect those decisions -- I guess they like the story 
so far.  For example, space combat tends to be somewhat abstracted, as the 
PCs are only passengers, or crew not involved in tactical decision-making.  
I tell them what the results are that they perceive, and they respond
appropriately.

Inasmuch as "recognized" isn\'t defined, you\'re likely to end up in 
nasty politicized litigation (but that isn\'t a bad thing with respect 
to opportunities for lawyers -er- adventurers).  Fraudulent presentation 
as a recognized representative (fraud by the recognizer or the 
representative); arguments over the standards for obtaining recognition 
from the Imperium; conflicts between two representatives, one of whom 
seeks recognition for the purpose of proclaiming allegiance and other 
one seeks to state that the world does not want to join:  these are a 
few of my favorite things, and they\'re going to be problems no matter
how you handle admission.  

The problem that I see is that the Imperium doesn\'t have a choice once 
the recognition of the representative is granted.  You propose some 
solutions on the back end, but these are fraught with political problems.  
The Imperium would have an easier time if it could accept or reject
candidates.

Well, by definition it\'s not an internal matter, it\'s an interstellar 
matter and an "international matter".  I specified that Hueiner\'s 
problem was with its "non-Imperial neighbor" Bhuuli.  Now what can 
the Emperor say?  "Welcome to the Imperium.  Regarding your request 
for assistance against the external enemy known as Bhullli, We regret 
to inform you that the Imperial Navy is terribly busy, but We do wish 
to express Our gravest concern and hopes for your good luck."  That 
has actually happened in history, of course, but why invite it?  The 
opposition in the Moot will make hay of it:  "If the Emperor declines 
to defend Hueiner from an external threat, what will happen to your 
world when it\'s attacked by pirates or worse?  Why are in this Imperium 
in the first place?"

This is a slippery slope, and the Emperor had better be very careful 
before venturing onto it.  If he imposes interdiction and an annual 
TCr1500 tax on t\'Rhussit Cluster, what is to stop him from doing the 
same to your planet, although you\'ve been with him since before year 0 
(but now oppose him on some issue)?  The Emperor and the Moot have guns 
pointed at each others\' heads on this issue.  Opposition to the Emperor 
can have drastic results, but crushing such opposition can spark 
insurrection.  It\'s not that the Emperor lacks the legal authority to 
take such action, but that it may be politically devastating to do so.

What do you mean "give the Imperium the strength"?  The function of 
the document is to govern intra-Imperial relations, i.e., relations 
among the constitutional constituencies of the Imperium:  the member 
worlds, the nobility, and the Emperor.  Who is the Imperium that is 
given the strength?

Relations between the Imperium and non-Imperial states -- including 
worlds that are considering joining, but have not yet done so -- are 
governed by treaty or some other agreement, not the Warrant.  Once 
the non-Imperial state decides to join and has a recognized 
representative proclaim allegiance, it becomes part of the balance 
of power in the Imperium.  

Thereafter, Article VIII allows "the Imperium" to alter its relationship 
with the new member in any way.  What does that mean?  I think that it 
means that the Emperor -- because the rest of the Imperium consists, 
after all, of the nobility and the member states -- can alter the 
relationship between himself and (including the Imperial government) on 
the one hand, and the new member on the other.  The political problem is 
that he can do the same to any member, for any reason.  Can he? Yes.  Does 
he dare to? It depends.  If he does it too often, or for reasons perceived 
as improper or dangerous by the Moot, the Moot might dissolve the Imperium.  
Can it? Yes.  Does it dare to?  It depends.  

The Imperium could avoid some of this brinksmanship by having an explicit 
acceptance stage in the process of joining.  Now the Imperium has to do 
all of its due diligence at the recognition stage.  

Nice job on the Warrant, Jeff (any inferences to the contrary from the 
foregoing notwithstanding).  I\'m going to use it in my campaigns.

Only if they never manuever. The way you have it grappled is the
absolute *worst* when it comes to stress placed on the grapples. Even
if the ship is merely boosting, that config is bad news.

Take a heavy keyboard or other elongated object and try holding it
parallel to the floor by only grabbing the small end. Feel how much
force you need? Then try holding by the long edge. It\'ll be *much*
easier.

No. You\'d be moving *sideways* in time. Consider the results for a
speed of twice the speed of light:

v=2c	tau=sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)
tau=sqrt(1-(2c)^2/c^2)
tau=sqrt(1-4c^2/c^2)
tau=sqrt(1-4)
tau=sqrt(-3)
tau=1.7i

Note that we are taking the square root of a *negative* number. This
gives weird results unless you are familiar with the sorts of places
where it already happens in physics.

The oxygen lowers the average molecular weight of that exhaust
*drastically* (18 instead of the 2 for hydrogen), that lowers the
specific impulse a lot.

If you use hydrogen (which will burn to water in oxygen atmospheres),
you just have a form of "NERVA" engine. That is, a rocket engine using
heat from a nuclear reaction to heat the exhaust, rather than chemical
reactions. 

Using a fusion reactor gets you better Isp than even the "gaseous core"
fission rocket. 

Frankly, given the various reactions discussed for fusion reactors,
most of them *won\'t* generate radioisotopes. Or you can "filter" the
plasma magnetically before releasing it. Either way, you\'d be dumping
He4 and H (no D, T or He3) as the exhaust. Other than being hot as
hell, this isn\'t a problem.

I don\'t have any precise information but I remeber that Cygnus X-1 is a
huge source of X and Gamma rays. Further more there are great gravitic
disturbance in the orbit or nearby bodies which indicate that Cygnus X1 is
very massive and dense (seems to be more than neutron stars)

Anyone has more precise inforamtions?

There are coyns portraying all six major races but none other and the coyns
were introduced well before any of the six invented j-drive but Droyne.
This implies (to me) that Yaskoydroy had something to do with making each
of the major races develop j-drive. In my universe Yaskoydroys children set
off some super tech stuff that eventually would disturb the super race
known as baddies from the core. When he realised that he killed off his
children, destroyed as much of his doings as he could and hid in a pocket
universe (Grandfather knew about the baddies and what they could do). Later
ha gave certain races J-drives so that when the super hightech but sublight
baddies (my invention) arrived they\'d blame one of the major races and kill
them off without ever knowing about grandfather. He put the psionic
Zhodanis closest to the arriving baddies in hope they\'d be the prime
suspects. The baddies are known to have exterminated all jumpcapable
civilizations in the galaxy about 75 million years ago and this is the
reason there doesn\'t seem to be any other high tech civs in the galaxy
(otherwise why haven\'t the Imperium found them with radiotelescopes?).
Nobody (but me) knows why the baddies hate j-drives so much and only use
sublight themselves.

When my players will find this out they will probably kill grandfather
themselves.

That\'s it.  Plus, in the case of IG, when you look at direct substitutes=20

In the case of Starships, I\'d recommend getting FF&S and T4.1 instead as=20
far as ship design systems and some basic ship designs.  Someday they\'ll=20
re-do Starships (next year, most likely), and it\'ll be a better book (how=
=20
could it not be?). =20

As for First Survey, the data in that volume has, as Andy Lilly pointed=20
out, been declared correct by IG.  Stu and I just wrote 32 additional=20
pages for the upcoming combined product of Milieu 0 and FIrst Survey (I=20
think they\'re calling it "The Milieu 0 Campaign," and it will be=20
hardbound), and one chapter explains the LL=3DGov thing.  In a nutshell,=20
for the first few hundred years (indeed, until close to the real First=20
Survey is done) the IISS has no standardized Law Level for worlds; they=20
just use the Government code to approximate the level of strictness on=20
the world (which makes sense, because LL =3D Gov + 2D - 7, averaging around=
=20
the Gov score).  The chapter then goes on to provide a seven digit Law=20
Level extension for use by referees in detailing worlds.  The published=20
LL (i.e., the Gov score) will continue to be used as a rule of thumb, and=
=20
for casual travel to worlds (i.e., the PCs stop over at the starport,=20
make a quick trip to the next town over, and come back), while the LL=20
extension will be used for more detailed adventures on any given world.

The additional material also includes a timeline of the first 200 years,=20
the expansion of the 3I over the first 200 years, some data on what=20
happens during that first 200 years (Julian Wars, Pacification Campaigns,=
=20
and so on), as well as 10 Patrons and an Adventure (based around the=20
Scout Cruiser, which allowed us to include the missing deckplans in the=20
32 additional pages).

So, if you\'ve already purchased First Survey, you\'ve got the correct=20
data.  If you haven\'t purchased First Survey, you may want to wait until=20
the Milieu 0 Campaign comes out, and get the additional 32 pages (plus=20
get it all in a nice hardbound format).

No this is a bad thing.  It means that the stuff isn\'t selling so the

It has also been mathematically proven that bumble bees are incapable of

OK, then why bother role-playing?  I live in a very real universe, I don\'t
need to spend my play time there too.  You seem to be discounting some of
the greastest works of science-fiction with a wave of the hand.  Shall we
burn all of the Dragonriders of Pern series because the dragons violate the
square/cube law?  How about Foundation?  FTL commo and travel are common.

Take a chunk of metal.  Let go.  It falls, right?  This was the accepted
understanding of the way the universe worked for thousands of years.  Then
people started looking at aerodynamics, and now I can make a pretty good
living taking people to a place where they get into machines weighing tons
that fly through the air.  Our understanding of the universe changes, and
it is the worst sort of hubris to claim that we are near understanding all
of it.

The moment you can show me a mathematical proof that jump drives *can\'t*
work, I\'ll give up all hope of booking passage to Dingir.

In the early 1970s, UN workers brought a tractor to a remote village in
Burma as part of a modernization program.  The UNies demostrated how the
tractor could plow a field, instructed a few of the men in its operation,
and left.  A year later, they returned, curious that the village hadn\'t
ordered any gas for the tractor.  They found the tractor on an altar,
draped with flowers.  They were worshipping it.  This was after the whole
thing had been explained to them.. it was still too much for their worldview.

>After the initial *surprise* he may sit down and say, "hey, I should of

My point was that Alan Turing wouldn\'t be able to grasp the most basic idea
behind a laptop running Windows 3.1.  The technology of microprocessors,
motherboards, storage medium, etc.. had progressed beyond what he could
imagine.  In the late 40s, an expert predicted the day when the world could
possibly need as many as *five* computers!

There is a scene in Harry Turtledove\'s WorldWar series where British radar
techs are examining an alien fighter, hoping to adapt its advanced
technology.  They open up the front of the nose, and are shocked to see
there are no vacuum tubes, just purple boards with gold lines on them.

Why is it that every generation assumes that it knows everything?  In 1901,
the chairman of the US patent board recommended closing his office because
"everything that can be invented already has been."  There are many secrets
left to discover.. and once again, we won\'t know what they are until we
find them.

Yes, because it is Traveller, not reality.  When 1996 came and went without
war breaking out between the Soviet Union and China, followed by a
forceable reunification attempt by West Germany with the Ost, did I throw
out all my Twilight: 2000 stuff? No, the game is still entertaining, even
if it is grossly wrong on a few points.

But still today we have aeroplanes with wings put on like this.
With the advances in material strenght they have made in Traveller
I really don\'t see why this configuration is so bad, for a unstreamlined
ship of course. Hell we have ships with armor that will withstand
a 12G missile hit, and the material is not supposed to handle this
situation for a 6G acceleration ship. I really disagree with you.

from the hubble space telescope within the last few years.  Obviously
indirect, but supposedly very strong evidence, nonetheless.  This was
very recent, so a source dated 1993 might be too old.

Do you mean the Zhodani Core Expeditions? There were some deep rimward
Solomani exploratory missions, those were mentioned on the list a while
back.

The Zhodani sourcebook has the Core expedition data. I know there have
been eight or so, but that\'s all I know, since I don\'t have the Zhodani
book, and the source I have is the MT Rebellion sourcebook which simply
mentions that the Core expeditions have been an obsession of theirs for a
long time.

Nope, \'twas Clarke, his great rival,  not Asimov, the other two laws are:

	Why? In the last 100 years we have gone from a purely mechanist
view of the universe, where there was serious doubt that heavier than air
craft could ever work or be practical to a quantum physical world where we
fly into space on a regular basis.

Why do you think we\'re going to slow down?

Yes, I did get the picture of the 27, not quite what I see in _my_ mind\'s
eye...what I see is more similar to a \'rod and ribbon\' model of a compact
protein, if you have a biochem textbook handy, or like those string and
dowel \'sculptures\' set into something like a geodesic dome, but with far
less regularity. Something that looks incredibly flimsy.

Sorry, but I\'ve never noted you saying kind things about IG or its 
products.  Your comments have ranged from very negative to neutral.  You\'re 
entitled to your opinion, and you\'re entitled to express that opinion.  
However, your previous posts aren\'t in agreement with what you have written 
above.

Okay, that\'s a reasonable argument.  But another reasonable argument 
would be, should a company never improve its products simply because 
earlier versions have been purchased?  Should Microsfot Windows have 
stopped at version 1.0, simply because people had purchased it?

Why isn\'t it correct?  It\'s a game; having the casual LL be equal to Gov 
type in the M0 period doesn\'t break the game at all.  It still provides a 
wide range of law levels.  And, the new rules provide additional law 
level detail and variation for those who desire it.


> Joe, i must admit that i am a bit disappointed in you that you 
> support this practice, i thought that you were "one of us"!

Heh.  I\'m certainly not in favor of Traveller products being of inferior 
quality.  I worked hard at bringing the _Starships_ flaws to IG\'s 
attention.  I spent a lot of my time keeping people informed for many 
months, when nothing at all was coming out of IG.  Finally, I earned the 
opportunity to design Traveller products (along with my compatriots in 
CORE, and the other designers) and I\'ve been working hard to create the 
best products I can within the guidelines handed down by IG.

In this instance, IG looked at the balance sheet and saw that they could 
not afford to print new galleys of Milieu 0 and First Survey at this 
point.  Yet, they wanted to decrease the cost to new customers for the M0 
setting materials.  So, they are combining the two volumes into one, 
hardbound volume (which costs considerably less than the two, separate 
softbound volumes), and adding 32 pages of material that should have been 
in M0/FS to begin with.  Finally, they came up with a plausible, workable 
explanation for the LL=Gov problem in FS.  They asked Stu and I to 
implement that solution, design the tables, and design the rest of the 32 
pages of additional material.

Objectively, it still seems the best solution overall.  The perfect 
solution would have been to fix the typos in M0, fix the data in FS, 
print it up in the hardbound format, and send it for free to everyone who 
bought the previous volumes.  But, IG\'s in business to make a profit.  
That means they have to keep their customers happy - which means they 
couldn\'t do the other extreme, which would have been to completely 
invalidate the previous FS data, issue a new book, and say, "tough; buy 
it or you\'ll be lost when supplements come out that are based on the new 
data."  

Instead, they compromised and implemented the solution outlined above.  
Everyone who has FS will be able to follow along with future 
supplements, as the data therein is correct.  Those who choose to buy 
the new "Milieu 0 Campaign" hardbound will have the same data we do, the 
same M0 book we do, plus 32 extra pages.  And, for years to come, all 
the future purchasers will buy the Milieu 0 Campaign hardback and have a 
volume that has not only the same data in it, but IG\'s fix as well.  In 
short, the solution is a good compromise now, and it will continue to 
work in the future.

That\'s business.

Since T4 added the fencing (with a sword, not moving hot comm units) skill,
and made such a fuss about Nobles dueling, I would have like to see what a
well dressed M-0 Sylean noble carried.

        I think that, like the nobles of 17th century France, weapons worn
by the nobility would fall into two classes: ornamental and fighting blades.
Because Imperial worlds are generally more secure than the French
countryside in the 1600\'s (not too much fear of highwaymen on Sylea, and
even if a noble encountered a bandit, he\'d likely be carrying a firearm of
some kind, which sort of negates the danger of a sword), most nobles would
wear ornamental blades at social occasions for two reasons: they would be
lighter and more comfortable than a fighting blade, and would allow a degree
of "chrome" that would compromise the integrity of a more businesslike weapon.
        An ornamental blade would be shorter (2 to 2.5 feet) and lighter (1
to 1.25 pounds) so as to make it less intrusive to milord\'s regal bearing.
It\'s distracting to have to wear a 3-foot (or longer) blade in crowded
conditions, because you always have to be watching to make sure you don\'t
smack someone in the leg or trip them as you\'re moving around.  It makes
sitting down an awkward, sometimes noisy affair, and keeping the blade under
control requires the use of your left hand, which could be better served
holding drinks, hors d\'ouvres, or milady\'s hand.  The ornamental blade is a
badge of status and wealth, no more.  As a result it can be fitted out with
expensive engraving, jewels, and precious metal plating- things you wouldn\'t
want covered in gore or scratched and nicked by another fellow\'s blade.
These swords could be works of art out of a heroic fantasy, thanks to
advanced metallurgy and processing techniques.  But you wouldn\'t want to
fight with them.
        Should milord find himself the object of a challenge, he would then
resort to his fighting blades.  I would expect there to be a fairly rigid
Code Duella in M:0, similar to the rules observed in 1600\'s France.  You
don\'t just throw down in the middle of the Emperor\'s birthday soiree.  Once
a challenge is issued, the challenged party can accept or decline.  If he
accepts, then the challenger picks the time for the duel, and the challenged
party chooses the place and the weapons to be used, which is a
check-and-balance that helps keep the right of challenge from being abused.
There is a story, for instance, about a certain French noble who sought to
evade paying for some work he had commissioned by challenging the blacksmith
he had employed to a duel.  The blacksmith, of course, knew that he hadn\'t a
prayer of beating the noble in a contest of swords.  However, as the
challenged party, he had the choice of choosing the place and the weapons.
So he accepted the challenge and declared that the duel would be fought with
sledgehammers, in five feet of water (the noble was five-six) at the village
pond.
        Once the particulars have been worked out, the duellists each choose
a second, who witnesses the fight and ensures that the other fellow doesn\'t
cheat.  Then out come the fighting blades.  These would be simple and
unornamented tools of destruction, finely made and well-balanced, 3,
sometimes 4 feet long, and weighing 1.5 to 2 pounds.  The type of duelling
blades would vary, depending on different fencing styles and schools of
thought.  Duels historically were fought with rapier, rapier & dagger,
rapier & cloak, rapier & rapier, or sabre.  There were also schools of
duelling with two-handed swords and polearms, for those with more
testosterone than they knew what to do with.  I think that over time a
similar situation would evolve in the Imperium, with different fencing
schools and styles coming in and out of vogue over time.
        While ornamental blades would be most common at court, there would
always be exceptions.  A fencing enthusiast might wear his fighting weapons
to court, or drape a duelling cloak over his shoulder as a way of
advertising his skills and inclinations.  Swords of Note (such as the
signatory blades of noble houses or knightly orders) could fall into either
of the two categories, depending on the personality and inclinations of the
founder of the line.
        A noble who commissions a blade might have two courses of
manufacture to choose from.  A very select number of craftsmen might still
be making blades by hand, which is a fine art that requires tremendous skill
and patience.  These weapons would be unique to their owners, made to order,
and taking advantage of very pure ore and treating processes available at
TL10.  They would also be very, very expensive, and would require some time
to build.  A waiting list of up to two years would be common.  Oddly, the
price between ornamental and fighting weapons would be fairly even, as the
cost of an ornamental blade would be in the price of the plating and jewels,
while a fighting weapon\'s price would stem from the more demanding attention
that a combat tool would require.
        Another course is to have a blade machine-made, which would be less
expensive but mass-produced to a degree.  A blade made with TL10 technology
could be drawn out, balanced, and tempered with computer-driven precision,
then laminated with a plastic coating that kept the steel forever free from
rust or grime.  The blade edge could be kept very hard and sharpened by
laser, to hold a deadly edge and resist dulling .  As a final touch, both
ornamental and fighting blades could be inscribed with beautiful and precise
laser etching, which could beautify the weapon without any hammering or
chiseling which might compromise its integrity.  An ornamental blade could
be covered in a glittering holographic design depicting a family\'s victory
in battle, or a fighting blade might bear its name etched in crimson script
along its length.
         

What\'s a good solid Imperial Marine Cutlass like?  Heavier than the rapier,
keeps an edge through the Marines hitch.  Even when it\'s used to chop
firewood, or to pry the lids off wine crates.  Oh ya, it has to stay
looking good.  Is there an Imperial Sunburst on the bell guard, along with
the Unit insigna?

        Solid is the word.  I envision a blade 2.5 feet long and about four
inches wide, shaped like en enlarged version of the current Marine issue
Ka-bar.  Weight would be a hefty three pounds, with a triangular blade
cross-section to add strength and stability.  The blade would be
case-hardened steel, machine-forged to precise specifications of hardness,
and laminated against rust.  The edge would be case-hardened,
laser-sharpened and laminated as well.  You can leave the thing in the mud
for a week, throw it from the back of a moving car, drop it off a cliff, and
the thing will still chop wood, drive shelter stakes, and cut people with
equal effeciency.  The finish would be blued or a natural carbon-black (you
don\'t want a mirror-finish while you\'re creeping around under a full moon),
with the Imperial sunburst etched on the bell guard.  On the blade, just
above the hilt, would be a stamp mark showing a serial number and a stamp
where the blade was forged.  Unit insignia would likely be left off, as the
weapons would be mass-produced, and intended to be generally interchangeable
between Marine units.
        A cutlass is an ugly, businesslike weapon.  It is a fighting blade.
For dress purposes or awards, there would be a different sword, like the
Marine\'s Mamluke saber currently in use.  Picture a saber whose blade is
made with a high content of Chromium, making it gleam like a silvered
mirror.  Beautiful and precise scrollwork is etched along the length of the
blade, along with the recepient\'s name, rank, and unit.  The hilt and guard
are plated with silver or gold, and machine-polished to dazzling brightness.
        Hope all this is helpful.  I\'m considering doing a JTAS article on
the Code Duella of the Imperium, and the weapons, schools, and tactics
involved  (maybe even some rules additions).  Do you think this would be
something that Traveller players might find interesting or useful?

Subject: Quotation.

Not that quote again!!!  The definitive history of the quote was done in
1940, by Eber Jeffery, in the Journal of the Patent Office Society. The
Commissioner of Patents who said it was Henry Ellsworth, in 1843; and he
meant it rhetorically, as in, isn\'t it amazing how many inventions are
being made today....

There\'s a brief explanation of this in Scientific American, February 1996,
page 32.

I found it. The TNS in Challenge 36 states the following:

Terra/Sol    Date: 123-1118
=46rom the notes gathered from the wreckage of the hotel room where
Jefferey Long and his family were murdered earlier this year, his
publisher has produced and released a draft of his works entitled "the
hyperspace web".
In it, Lon\'s notes suggest that he was jailed by Imperial authorities
when his investigative work, into the problems and mysteries of
hyperspace sickness, was becoming uncomfortable to naval researchers.
It states that popularized reasearch into the sickness was getting
dangerously close to research facilites the Imperial Navy had working
on breaking the jump-6 barrier.

This isn\'t much, but it does indicate that controlled jumps beyond 6
parsecs may be possible. And Referees Companion does mention other FTL
types at TL 18+

Hacking House Rules for T4

These rules are based on the rules for computers in the CSC ppg. 42-43.

The main emphasis on hacking is to do your intrusion attempt in as little 
time as possible, in T4 this means having your program finish doing its 
thing in 10 seconds before the bells and wistles go off.  Time is calculated 
using the computer processing speeds table.

3     Real Time
2     0.1s
1     1.0s
0     10s
 -1    100s(1.5min)
 -2    1000s(15min)
 -3    10000s(2.5 hrs)
 -4    100000s(1 day)

Most portible computers are at a rate of 2, as are \'House\' Computers.  The 
maxium data rate will only allow a level of 2 on the open air comm system. 
 But a direct line connection negates that.  Example a level 2 hand computer 
w/o a dedicated hacking program could hack into any unprotected level 2 
system on the comm-net within 10 seconds.  This is mostly what is out there 
on the net, peoples house computers and relatively "green" areas.  This 
isn\'t realy hacking, this is just sneaking around using someone elses ID and 
passcode.  By the way Hacking is more dificult than simple searching, 
cruising and figuring out "Portals-0" regestry tables.  Therefore it 
warrents the Formidable(3d) skill level

Secure Systems
I have given the Imperium 3 standards of computer security, based off of the 
TAS travel codes:
GREEN     Unprotected System.  Generaly Available Information
AMBER    Protected System.  What most businesses use to encrypt data and 
secure systems.
RED         Interdicted System.  This is the HEAVY ICE folks.  Government 
and Military data, and some Megacorps.  Super Secret Stuff! If they catch 
you, Buh-BYE!

To hack the realy big systems you need a dedicated program.  The House Rule 
I use for programs is that the machine can run up to the computer level of 
the computer, for example a LV 2 computer can run 2 LV 1 programs or one LV 
2. "Dedicated" programs, or those programs for a specific purpose require 
all of the computers memory capacity.  Storage is not a problem, optical, 
digital, and holgraphic storage media take care of that, but as a rule of 
thumb, I figure that a computer has a stock "Hard Drive" that can store(not 
run) Computer LV squared in program levels.  Additional storage can always 
be bought.

Ok so you loaded a "ICEBREAKER" program into your handcomp.  First of all 
this is the ONLY program u can run at this time.  Secondly your computer is 
now considered "Dedicated" and gets the +1 bonus to processing ability.  As 
long as you are hacking, your computer is considered a LV 3.  Now you need 
some way to reduce the time, this is where your skill (and luck) of a hacker 
come in.  To reduce the time by one step, increase the difficuly one step. 
 In my system, because I have players who like to push the envelope I just 
keep adding dice!

Ok, heres an example:
You have just jacked into the net using your homecomp, which by the way is 
connected via lines and not sat-comm-net.  You load up your "ICEBREAKER" 
program and look for that bank computer.  You get to the Banks datafortress 
and attempt to pass yourself off as an employee with full account access. 
 Lets say the bank is a local system, a level 3 system with Amber Access. 
 That makes it a level 5 to your 3.  It would take 15 min normaly to hack 
the system.  You work fast using every trick you know.  You need to reduce 
the level by 2 steps, +2 difficulty.  Well bud, roll 5d under computer. 
 Failure means an intrusion has been recorded and tracing is underway, you 
now have 10 secs to get what you need and get out before the ICE (Intrusion 
Countermeasure Electronics) comes, spectacular failure means that the ICE 
may send the police after you, send and EMV pulse to fry your deck, or 
whatever the evil GM has in store for you, you little punk!  Success gives 
access, but if some data packets are encrypted, you still need to decrypt. 
 Decryption is not a prob, you can decrypt there in cyberspace, or save the 
file and decrypt later.  Decryption has the same security levels as system 
security.  (This same meathod is used to decrypt comm signals by the way).

Here\'s a case for the Gung Ho Hacker:
Hacking into the BIA Database with your handcomp and a comm:

One, because you\'re using a handcomp your program aint gonna do squat, but 
you could try to use your experience and luck to foil the machine.  The 
BIA\'s system is a friggin huge LV 7 machine with RED Security Levels and 
NASTY ICE programs.  You logon, you got a level 2 it has an efective level 
of 11.  Total -9, it would take FOREVER to hack this system, but they will 
nab you in 10secs.  If you wanna give it a try, roll 12d under computer, and 
you better have at least a 12 total skill! I have yet to see someone who can 
roll all ones with 12 dice!  The average schmoe will have maybe a 9 (7 Edu + 
2 Computer).  If you fail with this, Sie sind Kaput!

This 2max for comm hacking works both ways, lets say a BIA agent wants to 
intercept a comm-net message on some civilian with a amber encryption 
package.  Comms have a rate of  0, +2 for encryption.  The BIA agent has a 
Hand Computer with a dedicated program, Level 3. but the bandwith reduces 
him to only 2.  This wiseguy can intercept and evesdrop on your comm 
messages in 10 seconds if successful. Pickled FNORDS anyone?  If he wanted 
realtime voice and video of your conversation, he would need to roll an 
Imposible(5d).

Thats some basic rules for computers and hacking.

    'body' => 'Douglas made some excellent points about how much things have changed just
in this century; I have some musings to share which extend and elaborate
his points.

First off, culture/tech shock, while disruptive in the extreme, is not (in
general) as utterly intolerable as some TML authors make it out to be.
Take an ancient Egyptian and drop him into downtown LA today.  True
enough, for the first day or two he\'ll have no mental model for what he\'s
seeing other than (perhaps) that he\'s entered the realm of the gods.  And
there\'s a fair chance that during the first 24 hours he\'ll get himself
killed -- by traffic, by doing something the police interpret as
aggressive/crazy, by stepping on the Metro\'s third rail, or whatever.

However, give him a few days -- and the chance to find a modern guide and
guardian -- and he\'ll being to understand that he\'s among people using
technology/magic he does not understand -- but for *purposes* he
understands completely.  People today (like people 5,000 years ago) eat,
sleep, fuck, talk with one another, worship, fight...there are no new
motivations, just different ways of expressing them.  A car will be pure
magic, as will the grocery store...but the idea of going to a market to
get food will be instantly comprehensible.  Within a week, our Egyptian
will be getting comfortable with the routine magic in our society, and
learning how to use it to meet his own needs.

This has already been tested on Earth, many times.  Native Americans
travelled to Europe as curiosities during the 17th and 18th centuries, and
didn\'t die of culture shock despite the 3ish TL and massive cultural
differences between the two societies.  Those inhabitants of the Valley of
Mexico not killed by Spaniards or smallpox were participating fully in a
Spanish culture within 30 years after the conquest, many much earlier than
that.  Never underestimate the power of human adaptability.

As for extrapolating technological change, I read an excellent essay on
this topic a while back -- wish I could remember the author or title.  It
suggested that projections of technological change tend to be linear,
while actual change is exponential.  As a result, short-term projections
tend to overestimate technological progress -- leading to the well known
premature hype phenomenon -- while long-term projections *seriously*
underestimate progress.  Where the cross-over point occurs is an
intriguing question; in the computer industry (which I know best), it\'s
quite a short interval, perhaps 3-5 years.  In other fields, I\'d guess
it\'s two or three decades.

Anyway, just my ramblings.  Comments, flames, and near-c rocks welcome.

	Sorry for repeating the following, I\'ve only been back here a few days,
but I note that the Core sector in M:0 also has law and tech level the same
value.

	If every planet has law = tech, then obviously you can\'t have people - for
example - running around with firearms in a higher tech society. Somewhere

Well the X in Cygnus X-1 stands for X-rays, so you got that right. 
Cygnus X-1 is a binary system, of a black hole and a normal star. About
15 years ago Gies & Bolton at the Univ of Toronto measured radial
velocity variations (watching spectral lines in the star, get doppler
shifted, as the star orbited the black hole) in the normal star, and
were able to determine that the other object had to be a black hole,
because it was too massive to be a neutron star. Doug Gies is one of
the professors here at Georgia State.   

The object is definetly not a neutron star, so it is either a black
hole, or something new, which we have no idea about.  Most astronomers
go with the simple explanation that it is a black hole.

2.  Every world has the law level and the government type equal.

Possible data errors, or at least things that need addressing:

1.  Vland has far too few people to be an industrial power that matters.
In general, populations are small enough that I would be very concerned
about the ability of many of these world to maintain an industrial base.

2.  Sylea has 30 billion people, and Shudusham has 70 billion.  This is
perfectly acceptable, but I got the strong feeling that it would be
Shudusham, not Sylea that was running the SyFed, were this the case.  Did
they really mean to have Sylea have an order of magnitude more population
than most of the rest of the SyFed combined?

3.  Worlds that would have to be stopped at en route to Shudusham or Vland
do not have full data.  Shudusham has been a member since -112.

There are others, but these are the ones that prompted me to ask IG for a
solution.

Actually it is detailed in the MT Referees Companion page 29 & 34. It is
impossible to go beyond jump 6 with our primitive jump technology, but

Eh? That\'s precisely what they\'re used for. A jump-2 ship dosen\'t need a
jump governor to make a 1-parsec jump. But if it dosen\'t have one it pays
for a full jump-2. Otherwise, what do you think they do?

Call me crazy, but I would say whatever a similar-sized jump-1 ship pays
for a one parsec jump. (With Megatraveller and TNE a case could be made
for paying N/M where N is the mumber jumped and M is the fuel used for a
maximum sized jump for the vessel in question, but I won\'t defend that
vigorously).

Will the 32 pages of material that should have been in M0/FS be available
somehow to those folks out there who have already purchased M0/FS?  If
they _should_ have been there, will they be available on the IG website as
a form of errata?  I hope so...

But we don\'t really know what really violates our universe because we 
don\'t have one universial tehory that covers everything. Rules and laws
of the universe evolve, just look at the Newtonian laws. Now we have
Einstein revisions of these laws. And If you take a deep look at
quantum mechanics and relativistic theories, you\'ll find that these
two collide on some rather important issues.

But still there is possibly a thousandfold left to uncover. But still
I agree that there is a difference between the caveman/Egyptian jump
and the modern man, mainly our disbelife in magic. We are on the other
end of the stick. If someone comes ant tells us that he has found 
something that he claims is founded in sound science we would probably
beleave him, because there is so much of the field of science that we
have no way of really checking if it is through.

But that is it. Maybe our laws are wrong. They might explain what we 
have seen today, but they can still be wrong. For example take the 
Earth. A thousand years ago the world was explained as flat, which
was a fair approximation for what they could see. A hundred years 
ago we thought the world was round, which at that time also explained
what we could see. Today we say that the world is ellipticly shaped,
because satellites has told os that it is. Tomorrow we might discover
that this notion has evolved yet another step.

Yes I would. Because by my notions and understanding of the universe

Bastardize, means to make or become illegitimate, and implies

That ship has long since sailed, boys.  For anything beyond broad
parameters that allow for certain game effects it\'s too late to
reconcile everything into a dogma.  Not that I would favor that
anyway.

Nope, because we don\'t seem to agree on what "canon" is.  OTOH, it\'s
*possible* you and I aren\'t as far apart as you might think.  If you
stopped writing "canon" and started writing "general guidelines"
that would help a lot.  If you were referring to the "spirit of
Traveller" not the "laws of Traveller", that would go the rest of
the way.

I can, pretty well, define the *conditions* that make a Traveller
universe, Traveller.  I refuse to support the idea that there is
"one true set" of events or technologies that describe those
conditions.  I support broad guidelines that describe a Traveller
universe, not the canonization of implementation details.

So, you want to invalidate which of the published versions?  What
details do you toss?  How do you decide?  What do *you* want to
throw into outer darkness?  Where do any of *us* get the authority
to do that, anyway?

Is a wonderfully wacky idea like "The Templars" acceptable for
publication in the Journal?  Yes..but it\'s never been mentioned in
your canon before?  No..but does your canon describe the totality of
all Traveller existence?

How about "Sparklers", are they in your orthodox canon because DGP
published them, or *out* because DGP published them.  If they are
out how do you justify expunging them?  Oh, because GDW later
rejected them?  But do you reject all of MT, and SOM and WBH too?
GDW came out with different rules in TNE that invalidated MT, didn\'t
they?  So is all of CT and MT expunged?

Well, do you reject "The Virus" or "The Empress Wave", and all the
rules of TNE that conflict with T4?  Will you, if IG rejects them?
I know some people would..heck, some people do already!  ;-> I also
know some people that reject T4 and stick to TNE, and some that
reject T4 & TNE and stick to MT, and....you get the idea.

No, K.C...what\'s good for the goose *is* good for the gander!  ;->

In regards Traveller, Marc Miller is IG, and, as for as I know, that
gander holds the trademark and copyrights.  If Marc changes the
details of any of the background or technology does that change the
goose\'s canon, does it change *your* canon?  Marc could reject EVERY
BIT of past background detail, not that I think he will, but he
could, you know.  What would you do then?

What I believe, in regards to Traveller, doesn\'t depend on
background or technology details, it doesn\'t depend on a version of
rules, or background, or technologies.  I believe in the "spirit of
the game."  Oh, and yes I certainly have to believe *something* to
be a heretic, if I believed nothing I\'d be an atheist, and play
M:TG.  ;->

I believe in the "spirit of Traveller."  I believe that when you
define that spirit, that there is an umbrella under which we can all
play, and call our games Traveller.  I believe that that this
umbrella can spread *very* wide to cover many things Traveller-isk,
and still be true to the spirit of Traveller.  I believe the ribs of
this umbrella are *any* of the sets of conditions that produce the
set of *effects* that describe the spirit of the game.

I\'ll happily help describe the "spirit of Traveller", to help
clarify the set of effects this spirit requires, and discuss the
sets of conditions that can produce those effects.  I won\'t agree to
the primacy of any specific implementation.

Ok, I\'ve had my say, and won\'t argue about it.  If we still
disagree, then we disagree, amen!

I don\'t object ot a common framework, but don\'t be *too* specific. What I
think you really want are the effects of the various
technologies on what we call "Traveller."

>I\'ll start the ball rolling with jump drives.

I\'d rather just say FTL transportation.

>1. The maximum is jump six.

General Condition:  Limited range that changes from tech level to tech
level.

Travel is limited to a relatively small number of parsec
per week.  Low Tech FTL can travel about 1ps/week, most
civilizations we play in can\'t exceed 3ps/week, and the highest we can
imagine is 6ps/week.

What game playing effects are we creating with this range
limitation?


>2. Jump takes one week

>3. While in jump, any interaction with other ships in jump, or with >
normal space is completely immpossible.

General Condition:  All ships travelling FTL will be totally
isolated for *about* one week.

What gaming effects are we creating by having an approximately uniform time
for each application of FTL travel?


What game playing effects are we creating by isolating ships in FTL?


This is the way I would express the questions.  How we implement a solution
is *much* less important than that we just meet the
conditions in ways that allow the game effects to work.


We could implement FTL with Jump Drives or with various Wormhole or Gate
Drives and meet all the conditions.  We could cover most of them with some
versions of Warp or Stutterwarp/jump drives too.

Just my way of looking at things.

Bet on the money.  But then, I work for economists.

From the sound of things, IG is committed to the FS data as it is.  This is
not what I would like, but I can always change the numbers I do not like in
my own game.  Taking a firm stand is better than being wishy washy, even
when I would prefer you to have made a different firm stand.

I cannot use the FS data as printed, and so I really, really think you
should release the data in a machine readable form, if only to those who
have already given you money for it in the form of buying FS.  IG clearly
has an interest in protecting future income potential from that data, but
you must balance that with customer dismay.  Joe, I sympathize with the
dilemma of you and Stu, given what was done before you had a chance to
influence it, but I hope that you sympathize with my own perception of the
data as flawed.  Your fix is an interesting one, but I already tried it on
my players, and got an unprintable reaction.  The response was very
impolite, and stopped the game dead.  It also produced a call to go back to
MT, which I do not want to do - I find the whole M0 era far more interesting.

The way it is, I _will_ have to scavenge the data and come up with law
levels.  My players demand it, and I am willing to do so.  I cannot do that
easily, though, if I have to also scan in the data and make corrections.
Further, I am not happy with the maps in FS, as I usually use subsector
maps, and can generate those from sector maps easily.  I would at least
like to start with the data you have made canon.

If you want me to mail you the front cover or title page from FS in
exchange for the underlying data, that would be quite fair, and I am
perfectly willing to sign things saying I will not propagate the data.  I
do enough beta testing, and am under enough NDAs that this is hardly a new
situation, or a hardship for me.  Further, this is the form in which I
would have liked to order FS originally anyway.  Heck, I even tried to
order the Merchant Prince data on disk years ago from GDW.

>Okay, that\'s a reasonable argument.  But another reasonable argument

A reasonable argument, certainly, but by bringing in another industry, you
bring up the difference between First Survey and the data therein.  The
data in First Survey is much like a computer program, in that duplication
costs are low, while the physical book is much like any other book in that
duplication costs are very high.  The FS data, to me, needs modification,
and since IG has said the modification is not economically feasible on
their part, it falls on me to do it for my game.  I would like a small
amount of help from you to let me avoid a large amount of needless work on
my part.

A side note: Steve Jackson games has been very good about giving out errata
for their games since day one, and machine versions of their tables.  I
still have the ten pages or so of errata that SJG sent me on GURPS 3
printing 1, and I have several character generation data tables that I used
in a character generator.  They asked me to sign an NDA, and to make sure
that their data retained copyright in all incarnations on my computer,
which I complied with.

I still do not have access to the missing deck plan from M0.  M0 came out
months ago, and the missing deck plan was known before it shipped.  Given
the competition in the gaming industry, it behooves you to push errata and
fixes.

Clearly, y\'all do listen, as the Internet pre-order plan was a good move,
and I signed up for it.  EA, as the first product done since the new
management had entire control of the process, was a well designed creation.
 I retain hope that the upcoming products will also be good, but I know
already that I will need to modify the UWP data, given the decision you
made.  I quite understand the constraints, as had you made the entire book
non-canon, you would have had a reasonable chance of failing
merchantability and a raft of irate customers.

We both agree that a recall would cost far too much.  I have hopefully
convinced you that one possible way to divert the complaints would be to
let those of us who are trying to work with the FS data have access to it
in an easy to manipulate form.

Not so nice-it\'s too big.  I\'ve corrected it.  Starwerx doesn\'t have a very 
large marketing department: someone blundered, released the TE22\'s 
specsheet with the Newphie name.  Here\'s the correct design.

Nuphraitelle class exploratory merchant ( SSDS/)

Tons: 3000td (SL Wedge)	Vol: 42,000 m3			Cost: 1,162MCr  (1,046MCr)

1 x Laboratory ( 8 std )				1 x Sick Bay ( 8 std )

1 x Minimal Hangar ( 20 std craft )	2	 x Spacious Hangers ( 50 std craft )

Crew Details: 3 cmd, 2 mvr, 3 elc, 4 gun, 1 scr, 5 eng, 5 crf,  2 trp, 1 
sci, 2 stw, 1 brk, 2 med

NOTE:  I don\'t know how legal the "100 ton" shuttle bay is, and I haven\'t 
been able to work in the extra cost of the collapsible tankage <it\'s only 
about 1 MCr or so>, but here is my design, sans shuttle.

Starwerx Orbital Foundry is proud to present its first entry in the latest 
ISBA competition, the Nuphraitelle.  A based on a medium-heavy streamlined 
wedge hull, the Nuphraitelle is outfitted with a 2 parsec jump-drive and 
fuel for 4 parsec\'s travel--2 in standard tankage and 2 in a pair of 
collapsible fuel bladders stowed in the middle cargo bay.

<An interesting variant here would be a J-2x3 ship-add another pair of 
collapsible tanks, 300 dt fuel each, of course, in the cargo bay.  It\'d 
reduce the available cargo space by 32 dt, and there would only be ~100 std 
of cargo when the ship was fully tanked, but you\'d get another 2 parsecs 
out of the ship without refueling.>

The philosophy with the Nuphraitelle is Opportunity, Capability, and 
Survival.

The Nuphraitelle\'s main sensor array, a Cassini Mk72 Survey package, is the 
standard among medium-sized Imperial Interstellar Scout Service vessels and 
gives the capability to survey uncharted or under-charted star systems. 
 The onboard laboratory lets the crew support a geophysical, xenobiological 
or astrophysical specialist to provide detailed analysis of the sensor 
data.

<I chose the Survey sensor package because it _wasn\'t_ military, something 
I wanted to avoid was the possibility of giving anyone who managed to 
capture this ship an Imperial Naval class jammer.   The survey package has 
equal range, is nearly half the cost and price.  The only losing points are 
the larger volume and power requirements.  Also, if the mission requires 
more Scientists, they should get the High Passage cabins>

Nearly half of the Nuphraitelle\'s volume is taken up by the three main 
cargo bays, each with a capacity of over 6000 cubic meters of storage, 
letting the Nuphraitelle haul impressive amounts of goods from the worlds 
it visits.

Quarters for the crew, 10 middle passengers and 2 high passengers are 
standard, as are 10 low berths, suitable for passengers or livestock.  The 
Captain, of course, receives his own large stateroom.

The standard crew\'s complement, beyond the bridge crew and officers, 
includes 5 pilots/flight crew for the small craft, 2 ship\'s troops for 
defense and security, a Science Officer, and a Broker/trader specialist to 
aid the crew in matters of speculative trading.  2 Medical specialists and 
2 Stewards round out the complement.

<If more troops are required, they get the Middle Passage cabins.  The 
Broker is going to be the ship\'s \'Scout\' who will know all relevant 
information on culture and commerce at the places the ship will land.  I 
suppose this could be done by the Captain and 1st Officer if the ship were 
smaller>

Although the Nuphraitelle\'s thrusters are only capable of 1-gee 
acceleration, the structure of the ship has been designed to withstand 
twice that stress.  1-gee of contragravity and streamlining make 
atmospheric interface and flight safe on any world, terrestrial or 
gas-giant.  The Nuphraitelle\'s redundant wilderness fueling capability can 
scoop and purify a jump\'s worth of fuel in less than 8 hours.

<The combined 2-gee acceleration from the thrusters and contragrav should 
get this whale... er, a Newfy off most planets.  The if one of the 
\'redundant\' fuel purifiers fails it takes 12.3 hours to process the scooped 
fuel.>

Spacious hangers for two 50 ton shuttles have been provided, as well as 
more modest facilities for a 20 ton ship\'s boat.  The adjoining shuttle 
bays, with minor modifications, are capable being connected and berthing a 
100 ton J-2 scout.  The extra mission flexibility provided to the ship\'s 
crew in transporting cargo, passengers or handling emergency situations 
should prove invaluable.

<Right now I\'m working on the deckplans for the Nephraitelle and I am 
leaning towards an \'under-and-over\' 50 std bay arrangement.  The deckplates 
between deck 3 and 4 would be removed and the bays connected that way. 
 Comments anyone?>

The Nuphraitelle is the first of Starwerx line of spacecraft and starships 
to feature "Mk3 systems automation," reducing the workload on the crew, but 
as with all Starwerx starships, redundant life-support and control systems 
are standard.  A Starwerx Mk8 \'Rambler\' class self defense package is 
included: 2 triple laser cannon, 2 sandcaster batteries, nuclear damper and 
meson screen.

<I\'m going to run some scenarios; a Newfy vs. some small, laser-armed 
vessels (pirates?  Fighters? Laser defensats?) and see how it performs. 
 I\'m pretty sure the only thing that will save her is her sandcasters.  I 
admit that the laser batts are a little weak, but this ship should be able 
to detect her foe and stay out of harms way before she should have to use 
them.  (BTW, if her batteries are combined, they\'re a respectable (+4) 
1/5-3-3-0 at a ROF of 100)>

As the Nuphraitelle\'s mission profile includes long duration missions away 
from Class A and B starports, a machine shop, engineering shop and sickbay 
are present (including an emergency low berth for critically injured crew 
or passengers) .  If it should become necessary the shuttles and small 
craft should be capable of evacuating the entire ship\'s complement.

<I hope this last point is never needed <evil grin>.  It would be horrible 
to have to abandon ship <evil grin> over some lost world with a thousand 
tons of cargo that you couldn\'t take with you <evil grin>.>

As for the crewing, the jump drive, the thrusters/contragrav and the 
reactors take 5 engineers each (a senior/junior arrangement on each system 
with one chief pulling double duty?).  The Survey sensor suite requires 3 
electronics technicians.  The ship\'s compliment has 8 in 
engineering/technical, 5 in gunnery/defense, 2 flight officers, and 3 in 
command.  Quarters for 5 small craft pilots and flight crew are included, 
but more may be needed depending on the types of shuttles/ship\'s boats you 
use.

Gotcha.  I went with multiple D6es because the original T4 system 
uses multiple D6es--I wanted KBv2.0 to be as close to the original 
system as possible and still fix the problems.

So, that\'s why KBv2.0 has so many dice.  I was trying to fix t4--not 
create an entirely new system.

Thanks for the feed back.  It lets me know that you would have 
probably gone with CORE even if there was no KBv2.0 and you were 
using official T4 rules.

Best,

Kenneth.

Yes, I thought about that.  I asked how Traveller was doing, and they 
said that it was doing fair, but they were expecting it to do better.

They said they\'ve got a few die hards that have been playing 
Traveller since the LLB days, and that\'s pretty much who they sell 
to--with an occasional odd sale here and there.

Now, at another store, the largest one in Houston, they\'ve moved 
Traveller to a prominent position in the gaming section.

It used to be in this buried section where they put all the new games 
(The Babylon Project took Traveller\'s old spot).  Now, it\'s moved to 
a verticle rack, and it has taken space away from D&D (one of the 
largest displays in the store--along with the White Wolf stuff, 
Battle Tech, Star Fleet Battles, and Shadow Run).

Actually, the D&D display is two side by side displays full of D&D 
books and modules.  I haven\'t seen anything else in this spot except 
D&D stuff in years, and here Traveller is, invading the D&D turf.

I thought that was a good sign--but maybe they are just trying to be 
more aggressive in moving it.

Now, this is some cool TML brainstorming.  I like this.  Maybe I\'ll 
play around with it.

And, in Traveller Cannon, they don\'t really know that much about 
Jumpspace.  They just know that they can go through it.  They even 
don\'t really know how the jump drives work--completely.

It reminds me of this Aeorspace History class I took in college.  I 
graduated from the University of Houston--Clear Lake, which sits 
right down the road from the Johnson Space Center.

Dr. Roger Blistein gave the course, and he was also the chief 
historian for NASA.

What makes me think of jump drives is what he described about the 
Saturn V rocket.  For you non-NASA types, that\'s the big rocket that 
sent the Apollo missions to the moon.

These things were huge with multiple systems.  Dr. Bilstein said that 
they were so big, that while designing them, the engineers would run 
into problems.  There were so many systems to deal with, that they 
would just start tweaking things until whatever was wrong was fixed.

Sometimes, this would be several tweaks down the road, and when the 
problem was finally fixed, they had tweaked so many systems that they 
really didn\'t know what fixed the problem.  They were just glad it 
was fixed.

This is hard to believe in the post Challenger climate of today, but 
ever since I heard that, I got a clearer picture of how starship 
engineers work on their jumpdrives.

And, I can see that much of what the Imperium knows about jumpspace 
is theory only.

I\'ve never had a problem with the money I put into role playing.  On 
an hour per entertainment value measure, it is the best thing going.

But, the point is, you have to compare the value you get with IG\'s 
Traveller products to similiar products with other RPG system.

Doing that, Traveller is just expensive--there\'s no two ways about 
it.

I\'m not sure I can agree.  I\'m a die hard Traveller fan, and I\'m 
sticking in there.  I like the new interior art.  I like the quality 
improvements.  But, my point here is that, as a die hard Traveller 
fan, I\'m in the minority.  Most of the role players out there won\'t 
be die hard Traveller fans.

As a matte of fact, I just got an e-mail from one of my players.  I 
told them all to go out and buy CSC and EA, and he did.  Then I get 
this message--

            "Jesus, Ken!  That\'s 50 bucks for two supplements!"

And that\'s my point too.  It is 50 bucks for two supplements.

I\'m trying to be a trooper, Joe, but you know that I call them like I 
see them.

When IG does something very good, I am the first to praise them.  
Reference my review on the EA.  When IG does really bad, I don\'t hold 
back with what I feel for political reasons.  Reference my review on 
FS.

This LL=3DGG stuff is a load of crap.  I\'m very disappointed.  This is 
definitely not what I want to see, as a devoted fan whose purchased 
EVERYTHING that IG has produced so far, I\'m outraged at learning 
this.  

I don\'t care if it is a business decision.  It\'s a bad one.  There 
are costs to doing business, and sometimes you eat something in 
order to make you business better in the future.  It\'s an investment 
in going concern.

As a small business owner, I know this more than most.  

I don\'t like it, Joe--not at all, not one damn bit.

And, now I\'m saying--


Maybe the reason T4 is not selling in this store (see my other 
post--I talked to the manager) is becasue of reasons like quality 
issues we\'ve seen.

I\'m all set to forgive some of the horrendous crap that we\'ve seen 
from IG, and I have hopes and good indications from the new 
management.

But now I hear about this bullshit of keeping the crappy data in FS 
and M0.

You have got to be kidding me.  After all this shitty product we\'ve 
seen for T4, and after still keeping the faith, we are hit with

      "Its a business decision to keep the data in FS/M0"

I suppose it is a business decision to keep the half die and the 
low skill impact in the task system too--especially after they\'ve got 
a second chance to fix the damn thing and a viable alternative that 
fixes every problem with it.

I\'m really getting burned up here.  My heart just sinks when I see 
stuff like this.

I want T4 to be the best RPG ever so much.  I\'ve got to tell you.  It 
is damn hard to keep the faith when you see IG doing stuff like this.

This is bullshit. Complete, total, bullshit.

Why the hell do I support a game that keeps treating me this way?

The Babylon Project is looking better and better all the time.

Am I the only person who feels taken advantage of?

Kenneth.

PS  I\'m sorry for all the hostility, but I\'m getting tired of 
promoting this game to friends and people I meet in the gaming stores 
only to see these types of decisions come out of IG.

I rarely blow my top, but this makes me pissed.

No, if you have a look at the IG website you will see that all the prices
for supplements have been lowered to $20. They also keep changing the price
of the new edition hardback which they are producing, although that hasn\'t
changed for the last few weeks.

Well, the law=gov I don\'t really care about, and the explaination given by
IG is plausable (although Vland having next to no population and the data
not matching M0, and.. are all problems that can\'t be explained away).
However, what gets me is the starport problem - I\'m sorry, but I don\'t
agree that there should be that many A class and B class starports.
Certainly not in M0 anyway.

What I\'ve taken to doing is using the players information, and then
generating the rest of the systems stats myself. Ok, so its not "official",
but at least I can modify them to suit myself. Like having one class A
starport a subsector, if that, and MANY more class X.

<chuckle>  I sometimes forget to watch myself when posting to TML.

Chalk it up to unfortunate phrasing.  It\'s not like the 32 pages were 
planned for M0 then cut.  But they\'re 32 very useful pages (i.e., a good 
reason to buy the new book, aside from the fact that it\'ll be 
hardbound).  All IMHO, of course.

Uh, no, the Core sector in M:0 is the exact same data as the "Referee\'s 
Data" for Core sector in FS.  In both cases, the two digits that are 
equal are Government Type and Law Level, not Law Level and Tech Level.

What you say is true.  Fortunately, it\'s predicated on an incorrect 
assumption, so doesn\'t apply to the discussion at hand...

Sounds cool - why do the baddies hate Jump Tech?  I am creating a new
minor race at the moment who are near the core.  Discovered by the
Solomani Core Expeditions - IPX ;-)  which will indicate that Grandfather
and his kids were much more powerfull then expected ... <insert dramatic
music>

:)

Another minor point - there is zero evidence that Grandfather gave jump to
the races apart from the Droyn - unless you have a conspiracy theory
going.

No Solomani, I was under the impression that the Solomani also did core
expeditions.  If not I can just make up a date - if so, I would like
the dates.

True, mathematically I can prove that an Elephant can hang by it\'s tale
from the side of cliff attached to a daisy:)

BUT, having said that I would *personally* prefer something which has
*some* kind of evidence and which can be worked given parameters like
"highly advanced civilisation" then some thing that is complete baloney.

Hi Kenneth,

Further detail about Law Levels will be provided in the hardbound "Milieu 
0 Campaign" (if I have that title right).  The UWP\'s provided in First 
Survey will not be changed.

Which enemies, specifically, are you thinking of?  I\'d like to take a 
crack at explaining it.

True.  The IISS had no Law Level digit in their UWP codes at the 
beginning of the Imperium.  Why not?  Take your pick:

1)  Some of the member worlds feared that advertising some of their law 
levels would have a negative effect on their tourist trade, so directed 
the IISS not to publish such data.

2)  The person in charge of the IISS was only concerned with data related 
to economic exploitation.  Law level wasn\'t important.  It wasn\'t until 
centuries later that the then-current head of the IISS added the Law 
Level digit.

Or..any other suggestions?

As for why the UWP\'s published in the IG product first Survey still 
contain Law Levels (rather than leaving it blank), it may have been done 
for a couple of reasons: 1) In order to maintain consistency with other 
Survey-style products to be produced in the future, as well as the 
format given in the T4 book and the T4 Game screen, while still 
providing a unique "feel" to Milieu 0, and 2) to provide Referee\'s with a 
guideline LL for use in casual situations (whereas the LL extension to 
the UWP would be for use in more in-depth scenarios).

Population is the number of permanent residents of a given world.  So, 
where is Vland getting those workers?  Are they, in year 0, engaging in 
slavery and not considering slaves permanent residents (i.e., not 
citizens)?  Is there a second world in the system that has a large 
population, is a client state of Vland, and serves as the main world\'s 
economic base?  Do they have robots doing most of the work?  Or is there 
another explanation...?

Maybe SHudusham hasn\'t the political will to take over the Sylean Federation 
space?  Maybe they didn\'t have the military might to do so?  Perhaps it 
was that their Economic Extension (explained in Pocket Empires) reveals 
that their economic base is woefully inadequate, and that Sylea in fact 
built them up to TL C in the years before the founding of the 3I.  Lots 
of explanations...

Yes, why would the Imperium not wish to publish that data?  Recall that 
the data in the first half of FS is what was published for public 
consumption and/or is generally known.  The stuff in the back is what the 
Imperium knows (or will know once it expands far enough).  So, why 
wouldn\'t the Imperium reveal the names and data for those worlds?  Hmmm.  
Maybe the Imperium has an agenda?

The point is that any sane engineer will avoid this \'cantilever\'
orientation if they have *any* choice at all in the matter.  A nose- (or
tail-) in configuration puts a huge bending moment on the attachment
point, as Leonard mentioned; it also means you don\'t get two or more
separated attachment points along the carried craft\'s length for
redundancy.

The wing comparison is meaningless; wings *have* to be cantilevered, so
they are.

The real underlying problem here is that, by any argument, QSDS massively
overestimates (IMHO) the area required for any carried craft except
(perhaps) a needle-config craft being carried on an airframe hull.  Rather
than propose clearly insane grappling geometries, let\'s see if we can fix
the underlying model, shall we?

Another example - of course this is *all* hypothetical and I would rather

I think an Egyptian would be able to adapt, eventually.  But if I whisked
away someone from 1000AD and plonked them in 2000AD (lets say 1997) I
believe it would take much longer for him/her to adapt and the initial
shock would be much greater then say, if I was whisked magically from
2000AD and plonked into 3000AD.

Now, bear with me, I cant fully imagine what 3000AD would be like, but I
can take a guess.  Almost all the technology we take for granted today was
invented in the last 100 years - steam engine, electricity, telephones,
radio, television, cinema, aviation, electronics, nuclear power and
(limited) space flight.  I find it difficult to believe some one from the
10th Century (an Archimedes or a Leonardo) not being shell shocked if he
now had to *live* in this society.  Not like the Native Americans you
mentioned who *visited* Europe, but who would have to live in Europe.

Lets flip the example, take an Egyption from 1BC and stick him in 1000AD
Egypt, he would have much *less* trouble coping becuse the advancement was
not so great.  Take the same Egyptian and stick him in 1997 Egypt and he
will find it difficult to cope - he will probably survive, but will never
fully comprehend modern Egypt.

It\'s tempting to think we would cope better in 2097 if we were
transplanted.  I think we would. Surely the fundamental scientific
discoveries have already been made.  Dont misread me I am also sure that
there will be *major* improvements in technology, but will there be
anything so new, so magical and as incomprehensible to us as a pocket
claculator or a video camera, or a TV or a plane would be to an 1000AD
Egyptian?

In the end though, its just mental excercise, none of us will know what
the next 1000 years will bring, but I would like to think that a man of
the late 20th century could cope much better if he was banished to the
late 30th century - then the poor Egyptian from 1000AD could ever hope to.

Huh.  I didn\'t know that, but of course you\'re right.  I\'ve been so 
buried in writing stuff for IG that I haven\'t read much of TML, nor have 
I visited IG\'s web site lately.  (I\'m now between projects - finished 
with my part of the M0 32 pages, and preparing to work on the outline for 
the next project, so I have some time to pretend like my life is 
normal<G>.) 

Anyway, the price drop is good news.  Hmmm.  Could be economies of scale 
(Traveller\'s selling so well they can print up many more each print run, 
and thereby get a lower price for each book printed), could be that the 
higher price wasn\'t working for them, or it could be a combination.  
Anyway, it\'s good news for me and you! :)

We\'re referee\'s, it\'s our job to explain the unexplainable <grin>.

That *is* weird, isn\'t it?  Having worked on Pocket Empires, I can 
conjecture that perhaps the A and B class starports have an economic 
reason.  In that book (if I can remember \'way back, three projects ago), 
one world can build up another world\'s starport.  Why would they want 
to?  To realize the economic benefit to the entire pocket empire (the 
more, better starports in a PE, the better off the whole PE is - better 
trade, and better ability to build good military ships).  There\'s one 
explanation, anyway.

I don\'t recall whether you were around when the whole "Blank worlds" vs. 
"full data" debate was going on, but I was on the side of having blank 
worlds.  What you\'re doing is almost certainly what I\'ll do whenever I 
have time to run a game (I play in two, but I just don\'t have time to 
referee these days).  Not because I think the FS data is particularly 
awful, but because I like to shape the universe to fit my ideas, rather 
than vice versa.

The Laws of Physics are a good start - I can not imagine the Law of
Gravity being dispensed with - can you? or the speed of Light?

So my point is that we should have as much science as possible and
minimise the fiction.  I think its fun picturing myself or in this
context my character travelling through a wormhole or hyperspace and
knowing this is not complete fantasy, this has *some* theoritical base.

Now, dont get me wrong, I see your point and I am sure there are still
lots of things to discover, but laws are laws - unless we screwed up REAL
big time they will not change.  Laws are called laws because no matter
what the circumstances are they will hold true.  We might add new Laws but
I cant see the current set being replaced even in a 1000 years.

Then again - they may indeed.  But we still need a scientific basis for as
much as possible in a game like Traveller, the *only* acceptable
technology or idea that can be hand waved is those which require the game
to work, like Jump Drives for instance.

Granted, maybe our laws *are* wrong indeed, but it I think its unlikely.
Why am I so confident?  Because they work, there beutifull and simple.  I
share the same belief Einstein did - how did he know he was right about
relativity way back in 1916, he had no observational evidence?  He
believed they were right because they were more simple and beutiful then
Newtonian theory of Stable space.

I *think* the current Jump system is ugly, so In my Universe I will change
it allowing only a minimal of hand waving for consistency (1 week jump,
when you enter Hyperspace you are cutoff from everything and the maximum
is 6 parsecs)

I hate to sound rude, but your kidding right?  Let me explain to you what
I *think* your saying - that the Jump Drives used in Trvaveller are
consistent with our current understanding of FTL and hyperspace and you
*cant* see why the Jump drive would not work in our Universe?

Let me explain, I *can* say with a great deal of accuracy how *I* would
act in a given situation.  Which is only logical since *I* know myself
better than anyone else.  BUT the honourable MrBerry was speaking about a
*another* persons reaction, not his own, which, unless you know that
person intimately you can not say with any accuarcy.  I hope thats cleared
that up.

As a side note such a concept (recording a mind and transplanting it) is
not that way out. In a paper by Dr. Chris Winter (1996) he
suggested dense memory of a great order of magnitude will be available in
aprox 30 years.  He also stated that to "recreat a person physically,
emotinally and spritually" would require about 10 Terabytes.  Therefore at
this point in time we have the technology to store someones memories  (in
the capicity sense, not an interface sense), so the leap from that
*current* understanding of the mind to transplanting my mind to a new body
is not to great.


Thanks for your comments MrGrav!

Right.  I\'m sure we could all come up with different approaches, but IG 
came up with one that is workable and they\'ve implemented it. Now we 
figure out how to make it work for us. :)

Not to pick on you, because you\'re not the only one to make the 
assumption implied by the above statement, but please keep in mind I\'m 
just a freelancer who IG chooses to offer contracts to.  I\'m no longer 
IG\'s net.rep, and I never have had control over IG\'s policies (and, 
frankly, wouldn\'t want to - I have enough to worry about<G>).  Since I was 
net.rep for so long, I just feel it necessary to point that out (but I\'m 
probably just paranoid<G>).

Just to clarify, IG came up with the idea behind fix.  I actually 
came up with the specific data to be provided in the Law Level Extension 
to the UWP, and the tables that explain each possible value for those 
digits.  But IG developed the original idea; credit where it\'s due.

I\'m glad you find the M0 era interesting.  I\'m a CTer from \'way back, but 
the Spinward Marches I used was a lot less well-explored than the 
official Spinward Marches.  I like M0\'s wide-open possibilities, the 
chance to discover new worlds, carve out a pocket empire, and so on.

As for the FS data being unusable, you\'re welcome to come up with your 
own data and/or fix (as I mentioned in a previous post, I\'d already 
decided long ago - even before FS came out - to use my own data, because 
I like to have a universe that fits my ideas, rather than vice versa), 
but in a few other posts I started the process of coming up with 
explanations for the anomalies.  It\'s at least a fun excercise; take a 
look, and add your own if you feel like it.

I\'d love to see a series of maps like the old Spinward Marches map, made 
for each of the sectors in FS.  I\'m told it\'s not in the cards right now, 
but perhaps sometime.  I agree; I\'ll be making my own subsector maps as 
well; it\'s just a lot more convenient than the full-page sector maps in 
FS.  But, that\'s me.

I\'m sorry, Scott, but I don\'t own the rights to anything published by IG, 
including my own work.  I can\'t help you there.  You\'ll have to contact 
IG directly and propose the above in order to get a definitive answer.

My wife is working on the revised deck plan for the Scout Cruiser, which 
from the original version (while maintaining compatability with the key 
provided in M0).  If IG decides to distribute that over the \'web, that\'ll 
be their decision.  Again, I don\'t own it.  When I sign the contract, I\'m 
selling all rights to my work to IG, including derivative rights and 
everything else.

Again, to receive a definitive answer, contact IG directly.  Present your 
argument logically and reasonably (as you\'ve done in your post), and let 
us know what happens.

Hmmm, dont see the connection to my statement.  I also agree that you

Thats fine, I am not arguing that it should be replaced.  Not at all (??)

Hmmm, did *I* say it was wrong?  *I* dont think so. *I* said that the method
used in Traveller does not mesh at all well with our current theoritical
knowledge on FTL.  After doing some research *I* have found an alternate
way and *I* will be using this system in *my* universe, but I would like
to hear TML gearhead opinion on *my* use of an alternate method and how to
mesh that into *my* Universe.

Please note the liberal use of personal pronouns.  I am *not* advocating a
change.  I never said that the Jump System in Traveller was "wrong" -
unrealistic, unexplainable, with lots of hand waving but not "wrong".

Yes I have read the FAQ, but its very much geared towards Star Trek system
of warping with only a subsection on the system used by Traveller and the
wormhole system I suggesst.  He also has a different defintion of a
wormhole then what it actually is (he uses the DS9 type of wormhole).

	BASED on certain simplifying assumptions, it was proven ... which doesn\'t
demonstrate that there is a fundamental flaw in math, just that the person
doing the analysis chose poor assumptions. That\'s the problem with
engineering. You can NEVER solve an exact mathematical model, so you try to
simplify it using various tricks that you hope won\'t cause the answer to be
too far off. For example, for values of theta close to 0, cos( theta ) is
approximately 1. Sin( theta ) is approximately theta (if theta is measured
in radians). Just taking trig functions out of an equation can make it much
easier to solve.

	The problem with the missile hit has absolutely nothing to do with the
acceleration of the missile when it hits, and EVERYTHING to do with
velocity the missile had built up before that. Try setting a brick on your
fit. Your foot resists the 1G brick just fine. Now hold the brick above
your head, and drop it on your foot. Same 1G brick. Hurts like hell,
doesn\'t it?

	No, they didn\'t. In fact, the LBB\'s stated you were free to change things.
But after a while Marc, Frank and Loren were also trying to create a
consistent background for those who wanted to use it (the 3rd Imperium).
Once you start creating a background that\'s supposed to work together, you
have to stay consistent with how things work IN THE PUBLISHED STUFF.
Individual referees have always been free to pick and choose. But if, in
Adventure 1, a meson spinal mount is a fearsome thing, and in Adventure 2,
it\'s an annoying gnat bite, it takes more work to make the published
adventures fit together, and can seriously undermine the whole roleplaying
experience. ("Dammit, that worked yesterday!"  "Yesterday was Adventure 3.
This is Adventure 7." "But it\'s the same universe." "Universe changed.").
Players have to be able to count on the basics staying the same, so they
can concentrate on the role-playing.

	In short, you (and I, and everybody else) should be free to do whatever
you want in your campaign. But the PUBLISHED, OFFICIAL source material from
IG should stay as consistent as possible. If something is obviously broke,
bite the bullet and fix it. But don\'t cause discontinuities from sheer
sloppiness or ignorance of what you did previously.

	And yes, there are ALREADY discrepancies in Traveller, even if you exclude
everything new. So do you make things worse, or try to keep from ripping it
to shreds?

	Actually, I think this is one of the biggest scientists make, presenting
things to the public as LAWS. That\'s actually a shorthand for "This is a
good model that does a decent job of predicting things under circumstances
we\'ve tried it under, given certain assumptions, and we expect it will work
outside those circumstances, but the further out you get, the less sure we
are they\'ll work, simply because we haven\'t tried it there, but we don\'t
know of any reason it shouldn\'t work that way, so until something better
comes along, we\'re going with this." Most people associate laws with
absolutes. Aren\'t many absolutes in science. Newton\'s "laws" worked fine
under earthbound conditions.

No, carry it further!  They *think* they know what it is, and base their
physics theories on it..but they are wrong.  They *think* they understand
how jump drives work, and design their jump drives based on what they
think..but they are wrong.  Maybe, if they *really* understood it they
would have jump-50, from a planets surface.  ;->

It depends on how long you have the drives lit up.

The velocity (in meters per second) of a ship at 1g is:

V = (9.8)t^2
    ----
	2

Where t is the time (in seconds) that the drive runs.  Typically 9.8
is rounded to 10 for traveller (gs could just as well be rated that
way in traveller since 9.8 is specific to earth).

The production quality of _The Babylon Project_ is very good. It\'s 
4-colour process, perhaps a bit overdone, graphically, but it\'s 
beautiful. Nearly 200 (thin) glossy pages with a lot of pizazz. Very 
legible typesetting. I have found some typo\'s, though. :-) There\'s a 
table of contents, *but no index*. To me, every rpg source book 
(especially the core rules) should have one.

It\'s a bit more expensive than even IG\'s stuff, but you get what you pay 
for. It truly is a thing of beauty. I hope that future Traveller products 
can even approach the quality.

>I\'m sure I\'ll go with the more interesting game (but I\'ve got so much

Tell me about it, my shelf of Traveller stuff is a testament to my 
fanhood. I\'m expanding my horizons a bit, though. I\'m sure I\'ll get EA, 
but I am going to be careful and choose new Traveller materials wisely. 
It\'s kinda sad, \'cuz there was a time where I\'d gobble anything up 
Traveller that had DGP\'s name on it, but IG hasn\'t yet instilled that 
sense of confidence in me yet. Here\'s hoping Courtney and Marc can turn 
it around. <a toast is raised>

Well, I\'ll copy a section from the SOM.  This is what I think they 
are used for.

I quote, verbatim.

Jump Governor:  When the command is given to jump, energy from the 
zuchai crystals is directed into the jump governor.  This device, 
which incorporates its own highly accurate computer system, is linked 
to the ship\'s main computer system for guidance and backup.  With 
utmost precision, the governor applies initial bursts of energy 
(about 20% of charge) in the proper sequence to the lanthanum net 
(which is incorporated in the hull of the ship), thereby "warming up" 
the grid.  At this point, if anything out of the ordinary is 
detected, it is possible to abort the jump.

The next step, the transition phase, commits the craft to the jump.  
It is impossible to abort the jump once transition has started.

The transition phase begins when the jump govenor feeds the remaining 
portion of the energy stored in the zuchai crystal array (the 
remaining 80% of the charge) to the hull grid, opening the weave of 
the desired jumpspace level.  Once this opening is made, the craft 
tumbles into the breach and leaves normal space.

Quote off.

Basically, I think the jump governor does just what this paragraph 
says--it supervises and controls the charge to the specific places in 
the lanthanum hull grid.  It does nothing with fuel.

Further, the SOM states that "the jump drive power plant consumes 
copious quantities of fuel very quickly in order to charge the energy 
sinks (typically zuchai crystals) with high-grade energy in 
preparation for the jump transition." 

 Later in the chapter, it is clear that the charge up is done before 
the acutal jump takes place--not simultaneously.  The fuel is used by 
the power plant to charge the energy sinks (the zuchai crystals), and 
this energy can be held in the sinks for up to 2 or 3 hours.

No where, in all the rules about space craft in the SOM, does it say 
that less fuel is used if a jump-2 ship decides to do a jump-1.

And, looking at my trusty copy of The Traveller\'s Digest #20, page 
38, and The MegaTraveller Journal #4, page 89, it states that the 
question of fuel usage was put up to Marc Miller.

In an in-depth answer, basically, what he and the editors at DGP said 
was that all of a ship\'s jump fuel tank will be used no matter what 
the jump being attempted.

The example they gave was, if a Jump-4 ship attempts to jump two 
parsecs, then the same amount of fuel will be used no matter what the 
jump.

Now, MTJ #4 did give an alternative to this for those GMs, like 
yourself, who want variable jump fuel.

I think I\'m just going to keep it the standard way.  The reasoning in 
the SOM makes sense to me.

I must say, this is the one I have a hard time with.  It just reeks
"after the fact rationalization".

I can accept that a population of 30 billion could dominate
70 billion, and basically IG is saying that "we blew
it and real law levels will have to come out later (though
they could have been a bit more forthright about it), or
that the Imperium had reason not publist all the data, but
the idea that a population that low would have been that
much an obstacle does make it.  If Vland had _that_ many
robots or slaves (or whatever), it would have been such
a salient feature it would have been the first thing
you think about when they are mentioned, not an after
thought that has been brought out yet.  I would suggest
that IG\'s just publish an errata that the pop digit of
Vland is wrong.

Yes.

Not exactly, more like at TL\'s of 16 & below there in no known way to
deliberately vary jump duration beyond these limits without causing a
misjump.  Since superficial misjumps may take as little as 110 hours (4
days & 14 hours) or as much as 260 hours (10 days & 20 hours) it may be
theoretically possible to deliberately cause jump durations of these
lengths.

Again, not exactly.  In the Fated Voyage adventure (Challenge #46 pg
26-35 by Michael R. Mikesh) a number of people on the players ship
suddenly experience nausea, as if the ship were in a misjump, & what
seems to be a rare flight anomaly known as a jumpspace node appears. 
However it is actually a gate onto another starhip, the Lorens Ecliptic
which never came out of jump space in 1085.  Like all the best traveller
adventures the deus et machina is revealed to be a mysterious item, the
Ottem, which was stolen from a group of Chirpers from a low tech world
in Zhodani space.  Gee I wonder who could have built it....

Well only if you believe that the galaxy really is flat.  If you aren\'t
willing to believe this you may think that the two dimensional
representation of charted space as flat may be somewhat lacking in
verisimilitude, shall we say.  I\'m enough of an orthodox Traveller
believer (There is no God but Yaskodray and Mark Miller is his prophet.)
to be willing to pretend I believe the galaxy is flat for the sake of
the game however.
 
> > Parsecs are also refered to as \'hexes\' in Imperial society ;-)

Are they ? Oh sure the players call them that but do the charecters ? 
IIRC the are more apt to say "jump 4 away" or something similar.

> 5. Jump drives use Lanthanum.

No, not exactly.  Almost all jump drives use lanthanum however you can
build jump drives out of barium but they will tend to fail after 10 or
20 jumps or so. The region around Lair is fairly low on Lanthanum so the
early Vargr jump drives were all made of barium.  Interestingly
lanthanum & barium are similar elements so this does not seem that
implausible.

			Lanthanum	Barium
Atomic #		57		56
average atomic mass	138.906		137.3
oxidation states	+ 3		+ 2
Electronegativity	1.10		0.89
density			6.15		3.5
melting point (c)	918		729
boiling point		3464		1898
crystal structure	hexagonal	body centered cubic

The only real difference between lanthanum & barium is that lanthanum
has 1 electron located in the 5d row & barium does not.  It is possible
that jump drives could be made out of Cerium, element 58, which seems
(based on my rusty chemistry) to be as similar to lanthanum as barium
is.

During editing of TLWH for the IG version, I noticed a few errata that had,
irritatingly, slipped past me in our original version of TLWH. As soon as I
have time (i.e. June 2003) I\'ll post the appropriate fixes to the CORE web page.

I\'m praying I haven\'t left any errors in the new IG adventure, but there\'s
quite a lot of star system data, etc. to check through, so something has no

As far as I know, the Solomani made explorations to the *rim* (edge of 
the galaxy) *not* the core. To quote from DGP\'s _Solomani and Aslan_

"Our boldest exploration venture is the ongoing Perseus Project, which in 
5568 sent 17 base ships far out toward the Perseus Arm of the galaxy -- 
the next spiral arm beyond our Orion Spur\'s Sagittarian Arm."

"The Iouo was the last ship to return in 5624, after it explored star 
clusters on the fringe of the Auriga Arm, almost 3,000 parsecs distant. 
Three of the ships have yet to return, including the largest, Home."

>A Zho commando can only teleport 1 mile?  Doesn\'t sound as scary as I thought.

If they could (regularly) do more than that, most of the Zhodani/Imperium
fleet battles from Traveller \'history\' would have been rather different,
with the Imperial fleets blowing up just a few minutes after being detected
in a system (i.e. taken out by a few tens of suicide Zhodani teleporters
carrying nukes, or with intimate knowledge of how to wire up Imperial fusion
plants to overload, or somesuch).

Frankly, it\'s pretty scary to me being able to teleport just *100* metres.
Imagine many of the hostage, hijack, bank job, etc. type situations, even
without considering the military implications on the ground...

Imp trooper 1: Well, Jack, we\'re pretty damned safe here in our hermetically
sealed bunker 50 metres underground, with nuke-proof armour around us.
Imp trooper 2: Yep. No way them pesky Zhodani can knock out *this* air
defence missile control post, eh?
Death: REALLY?
Sound of automatic weapons fire.
Faint \'blip\' as Zhodani trooper teleports out again.

And again...

Zho Terrorist 1: Well, Jackski, we\'re pretty damned safe here in the
embassy, with our 40 armed colleagues around us.
Zho Terrorist 2: Yep. No way the pesky authorities can stop us holding the
ambassador to ransom so they have to meet our demands, eh?
Death: REALLY?
Sound of automatic weapons fire.
Faint \'blip\' as Zhodani trooper teleports out again.

etc. etc.

In much the same way that Grav Belts put a whole new perspective on
Traveller games (cops chase player, player gravs into the air, cops - who
don\'t have the resources to equip every officer with a grav belt - curse and
shoot at him, but basically the player\'s got away...), so too does
teleportation!

ANY FTL system *will* require hand-waving.

ANY system *will* be unrealistic because we have yet to discover anything

want to use wormholes, go right ahead. Just please, please, please, stop 
"DISSing" Traveller Jumpspace. I take it kinda personally. :)

Here\'s the thing. Why do you say the Traveller Jump system is ugly when 
the only "official" explanation for how it works is: A) 1 week jump  B) 
Enter Hyperspace and you are cutoff from everything and C) the maximum 
jump distance is 6 parsecs.

Exactly the parameters you say you will have "handwaved" into your 
system! Oh, and there\'s also the misjump rules. The "What happens" is 
explained, the "How" is irrellevant. It\'s gravy. This is a *Game*. Until 
somebody (or even someTHING!) actually breaks the light barrier, we just 
won\'t know how.

At the risk of repeating what\'s been said, I\'m not knocking your quest 
for a wormhole based system. That is admirable. Coming up with a 
plausible pseudo-scientific explaination is a good thing to do. I\'m just 
attempting to refute your assertion, which you *seem* to always make, 
that the Traveller system is flawed and WOULDN\'T WORK.

I, too, hate to sound rude, but, he kids you not.

I\'ve *tried* to understand your point of view. But I just don\'t 
understand why you can\'t accept the *fact* that Jump Drives are perfectly 
legitimate solutions to Interstellar travel. Let me explain to YOU 
*exactly* what he\'s saying.

1. Hyperspace is not real.

IT IS FICTION

We have NO current understanding of Hyperspace

There is NO proof that it exists

2. FTL is, to our current knowledge, IMPOSSIBLE.

Therefore, we have NO understanding of FTL travel

3. Since we have NO understanding of HYPERSPACE nor FTL travel, Jump 
Drives CANNOT be inconsistant with reality.

Therefore, to conclude, there is NO reason why Jump Drives would NOT work.

We also have no reason to believe that ANY FTL system WILL work. But that 
would make for a boring game. That\'s why in the TRAVELLER universe the 
Hyperspace concept is assumed to work.

This is tiresome. Unless you can give me one (1), specific verifyable 
source refuting Assertion #1 or Assertion #2, (that is, beyond wild 
speculation, which is all Hyperspace and FTL travel is at this time), I 
have nothing more to say on this matter.

that I am really asking is that IG publish a flyer or small booklet 
(like the MT errata sheets by GDW) for those of us who already bought 
the book, maybe even at the price it costs them to print that, 
although i feel that belongs to the "service department". That\'s all 
it takes to make me a happy customer again, a very happy customer, 
indeed!
However, if they insit that you will have to buy the new book if you 
want the data, i can\'t help but feel cheated!

- -> level detail and variation for those who desire it.
But those new rules will only be available to buyers of the new HC. 
For owners of the old books, the data will still be unuseable, and 
therefore false. In the Traveller Universe, LAW isn\'t GOV, maybe 
approximate, but NEVER identical on EVERY world of the Imperium.

Even if the Imperium doesn\'t have Law Levels yet, our games do, 
Traveller does, and IG had better too. For the DM, one of the most 
crucial informations about a world is still missing! I just don\'t 
like that very much! Sorry, but that\'s how i feel!

and the rest of CORE put out so far (the best IG did so far was hire 
you guys!), but the fact that you supported IG\'s (in my eyes just 
plainly stupid) move hit the wrong chord! I apologize!

No the best idea would have been to publish the errata on the web

They didn\'t need to do that. They could have put the data on a CD 
(doesn\'t cost much to do

would have been better! This disk could then also be included with 
the First edition of FS. 
They could have said :"Sorry, we made a mistake, but hey, such is 
life, accept this disk with the correct data, since we can\'t afford 
to print it out!" That would have been totally acceptable. If people 
make mistakes they should stand by them, admit them, not try to 
explain them away. That just makes people upset!Ad Astra,

In order for you to put the Win95 sticker on your box you have to be
runnable on NT and be entirely 32 bit. You are also required to be
compatible with OLE. These requirements have relaxed a bit since the
release of Win95 and the 32 bit requirement would actually forbid MS
putting the Win95 logo on Win95 itself as it has lots of old 16 bit code

Good to hear that for those of us with the original books.  Of course, I\'d
really been hoping for my own free copy of both volumes of the new edition
as I\'d so bravely bought the BITS version.  :-)

As I recall, this was the book you claimed was \'damned\' in the dedication.
There\'s no hope for it.

Are there any attempts at adding Traveller j-drives to GURPS vehicles? If

The last quote is some evidence that grandfather "gave" jump tech to the
major races. How else would he know which ones were to be major long before
they actually became major races? Especially troublesome is the fact that
Aslans are on the Coyns as they have lately been proven not to be major.

A simple explanation to this mess (I like it but others may not) could be
that grandfather has changed what the coyns depict over time - the initial
set didn\'t have the major races on them, this was added much more recently.

        Excellent work, Joseph. Another longly cited, not-so-minor race is
added to the Traveller Universe.

        Two notes here. First, (according to MT\'s Ref\'s Manual) the
habitable zone for an F5 V star, and hence, I assume that also for an F4 V
one, is orbit 4, which is 1.6 AU. You are putting Ilelish at orbit 5, which
would be in the Outer zone (cold and inhospitable). Of course,m at only 1.6
AU, the year will be shorter, so some minor changes would be required.

        Second, atmosphere is Standard/TAINTED. What is the taint? How does
it affect the Suerrat\'s breathing capabilities? I see two possibilities here:

        1) The taint is a high percentage (say 15%) of CO2 and CO, which is
explained by a different "oxygen revolution" caused by the native flora. The
jungles produce far more CO2 than the terran ones. So, most humans will find
it difficult to breathe in such an atmosphere, requiring filter masks. The
Suerrat are adapted to this, which explains some anatomic differences,
namely the noses (see below).
        2) The taint is an endemic disease, probably a descendant of the
disease that killed the Ancient colony (see below). The Suerrat are immune
to it, and it does not usually affect humans, but Droyne and Chirpers die in
a few days if they catch it. The plague does not survive for a long time in
non-affected organism, so it cannot spread offworld easily.

        The nose is more prominent because it holds a filtering system which
allows the Suerrat to breath Ilelish tainted atmosphere...?

        Not very patient, are they? A very minor comment: This does not fit
perfectly well with the Slower-than-light colonization efforts. How does a
Suerrat volunteer for a decades-long journey? Perhaps they have some degree
of stubbornness, and, once they have made a decision, they stuck to it, no
matter the consequences.

        These are nice bits, exactly the kind of stuff that makes a "human"
society more alien than human.

OK here follows (subject to change at the referees whim):

The baddies from the core handles the galactic powerplant (the blck hole at
the center of the galaxy) and jumpspace is actually a power grid that
channels the power generated to various parts of the galaxy. The baddies
are a created race whose purpose is to maintain the powerplant at all cost
(this is built into their genes and is unknown to them). Ships jumping
create tiny disturbances in the power distribution function of jumpspace
but when the Ancients started experimenting with jumpgates the baddies
realized they had to stop this disturbing of the "holy" powergrid. Out they
went to exterminate the civs doing the damage. The baddies have
exterminated jumpgate civs before throughout the galaxy which was what
grandfather found evidence for.

Unknown to the baddies and everybody else is the race that actually built
the powersystem an created the baddies but what they\'re up to etc I haven\'t
thought out yet.

BTW Thanks Eris, for coming up with the supercool idea that jumpspace isn\'t
a naturally ocurring phenomena but an artifact of some kind. I\'ve always
disliked the canon(?) idea that jumpspace isn\'t understood by the Imperium
despite them using it all the time. This would be unbeliavable if jumpspace
was a natural thing but maybe not if it was created. Sort of like some
lowtech insects who find electric wiring in the forest and learn to use it
to start fires. They have a large body of knowledge on how the arcs and
wires seem to work but really no idea what the cables are or wether they\'re
natural or not. All goes well until some powercompany guy gets pissed and
exterminate them.

It assumes things that seem different from canon. Like the ability to
keep up a jump "bubble" indefinitely, or the ability to survive in jump
space without one.

Also, the odds of ever encountering another ship are rather slim. There
are a *lot* of cubic kilometers in a hex! A parsec is about 3e13

Well, the way Forward sees it, there\'s no problem with time travel, but
if it occurs, that means that creating paradoxes is impossible, as the
universe won\'t "allow" them. So if you are visited by a future version
of yourself, when the time comes, you *will* make the trip.

It\'s an SF novel with an appendix going into the gory details,
including references to published papers on the various ideas.

We only do that with wings because they *have* to stick out. No sane
engineer will design such loads in if they can be avoided. And they
especially won\'t do it with something that is intended to *detach*.
Note that when faced with wings that have to fold (on carrier aircraft)
they make them fold at *right angles* to the stress. They fold *up*,
not *back*.

You have to realize the difference between what can "be" done, and what
is *practical*. Hulls can take missile hits because the designer
doesn\'t have a choice. But given the *choice* between surface area used
and using super-strong grapples, guess which will get used?

	How long is it accelerating for?  Once you\'ve got that answered,
hit the travel time tables in the manual, and whip out your trusty pocket
calculator...

	Unless by blast acceleration you mean that the impetus was given to
the ship by an explosion?

editor to do it, either the homebrewed Pforte or Forge, which comes with
the (Mac) Marathon: Infinity package.  I don\'t know whether M2 for Win95
comes with an editor.

	I\'d check out Bungie\'s web page, tho.  IIRC, there are M2 Mac -> M2

	Even if you can\'t get a map editor, I would strongly recommend
buying M2 if you can get it.  It is quite simply a fantastic DOOMer.
Graphics are real good, physics were about the best there was in the genre
until Duke Nukem came out, and gameplay is a lot of fun; you\'re running
around breaking aliens and shooting things and recieving instructions from
a slightly demented AI with a truly twisted sense of humour, and
discovering plot elements and background to what\'s actually a pretty darn
good SF story.

	It\'s quite addictive.  Two years ago, I was playing it on a truly
obsessive basis, until I had almost reached the point of reflexively trying
to hit the spacebar with my left thumb every time I saw someone in green.
At one point, it got so bad that one day in class I slowly began dozing
off, still following the prof\'s lecture, until I fell completely asleep...
at which point I began dreaming, upon which the prof\'s line of argument
turned into a Pfhor (7" tall gray skinned three-eyed alien with a
respirator, armour, and a nasty cattleprod/spear) which immediately charged
me.

	So before it had hurdled the first row of desks I blew it all over
the blackboard with the MA-75\'s integral grenade launcher (in trav terms,
an ACR-10 WIGL), and promptly thought "Shit, I can\'t fire this thing off in
class!" and woke up, somewhat disoriented :).

	It\'s too bad that they don\'t have the first and third ones in the

felt exactly like Aliens: dark claustrophobic, hopeless, and M:I was IMHO
the hairiest of the bunch.

	This must be the best solution, and IG could put it on game magazine cover
disks as well for people who are not on the net, or can not download it for
whatever reason.

	I have bought the first seven books, I think it is, except Aliens Archive.
The core rules\' errors now seem minor in comparison to some other releases.
The data in First Survey is almost useless, and I intend rolling up my own
starmaps. The Core sector map in Milieu 0 is equally worthless, although
almost everything else in there is excellent. And the starship deckplans in
Starships are a disgrace; most of us could do better.

	Only Emporer\'s Arsen*l and Central Supply Catalogue seems to be without
major structural flaws, as far as I know. I think EA is well structured,
there are nice pics of the weapons in action, they are sorted by tech
level, and there is an excellent summary of everything at the back of the
book. CSC has a lot of detail and decent background for a lot of the
equipment. Oh, and I bought the referee\'s screen thing which I like quite a
lot actually!

	On top of this, I was due to start a campaign last night, my first real
Traveller playing in eight years, apart from meeting and playing a game
with Andy Lilly at a games convention last Saturday ;-) Hi Andy! Anyway
right, last night, about half an hour before we were to trek off to the
venue one of my players phoned up ill with the \'flu, so we\'ve had to put it
off till next week. Was I pissed off or what, espech after months of
preparation.

	However, I may use that time to design some alternative _usable_ starmaps
that my players can adventure in, somewheres that have low government level
planets with high law levels, for example, democracy (2) with strict gun
control (7 or 8 upwards); apparently impossible in the T4 setting.

        Is a descendant of this plague what causes the taint in Ilelish

satellite, that caused extinction of the Chirpers when the Zhodani first
reached the satellite?

        Do you mean "inhospitable"? The temperate zones out of the jungle
are not very comfortable by Suerrat standards, right? Anyway, I envision the
Suerrat "colonization" of new areas as a "jungleformation" process... the
more resistant trees being seeded all around, in a desperate attempt to
create a new jungle. This would make the Suerrat science more biological
than tehcnical...

        This creates a tradition of "renacentist man", something like a
nobility with a dilettante interest in the sciences. Modern Suerrat nobles
could keep a tradition of serving some terms as Scholars, contrary to, for
example, some Solomani traditions of nobles serving in the Navy.

        The first time industry moved, out of the equatorial jungles, a
massive population movement followed. Did it occured again when industry

        Another possibility to explain the not-very-patient Suerrat ("eager
colonists") decades-long trips to the stars would be to assume that they
used low-berths, but it has already been stated (Imperial Encyclopedia,
IIRC), that they relied indeed in generation ships. So, the question is: Why
didn\'t they use Low Berth? Maybe a natural dislike about being "freezed"?
For the Suerrat, who originated in warm jungles, the "hell" would be a very
cold place...

        At that time, the Vilani kept the Jump Drive secret fairly well. I
was not until the last days of the Ziru Sirka that they started to lose
control of tehcnology in the borders of the Empire... better keep the
Suerrat obtaining of the Jump technology as a not-very-clear issue... maybe
some far-range Geonee merchants gave them the technology, they were the only
other starfaring race with Jump Drive at that time.

        Very nice bit. Nevertheless, the three corporations supported

I\'ve passed all the necessary data and diagrams to IG and, to my knowledge,
it should all be in there. It was primarily these diagrams which had a few
errors in them in the original version, occasionally having somehow missed
out the primary planet!

I shall have to check the (c) situation with regard to which errata I can
put on our web site.

We can make errata for our TLWH available on our web site, but I shall have
to check the stuff for the IG version. Put simply, there were sections we
designed for the original TLWH which didn\'t fit into the 100 pages, but
which are being integrated into the two 64 page books for IG ("The Long Way
Home" and "Gateway"). These additions are obviously our own work, created
outside of IG\'s brief, and thus might in some form appear on the web page,
however we have to respect the very restrictive contracts IG places upon us
once they buy our work.

Basically, I\'ll sort out with Tim Brown and Marc Miller what is allowed -
they\'re both very reasonable guys and I\'m sure will allow us some leeway on
this issue for our original customers, provided we don\'t compromise their IG
sales.

Hate to butt in but also what is the max velocity a ship could obtain 
using 1G accel. and assuming unlimited time and fuel? Is there an 
upper limit dictated by the ship\'s strucure, or can it keep accel. at
1G, 2G, 3G wahtever depending on the manuver drive and limited by
the speed of light?
Just curious.

FS has complete data for referee\'s, and partial data for players.  The 
only "full data" item missing is maps with every world marked.  So, what 
you\'re saying is that you would have preferred that FS contain full maps 
instead of (or in addition to) the partial maps already in there?

:)  Well, if we\'re all known for buying every item that has the word 
"Traveller" on it, I guess it would be difficult not to give in to 
temptation and take advantage of that situation.  (I\'m not saying IG did 
that; god, I hate always having to be so darned careful about such 
misunderstandings...can\'t even joke around without worrying!)

Well, at least you\'re not feeling UNreasonably cheated. That would be 
much worse. =)

I don\'t know all the circumstances at IG or in the RPG marketplace, but 
it seems that a reasonable course to pursue would be to handle it like 
the old High Guard 2nd Ed. - put the additional material in JTAS, spread 
out over three issues.  That would work for the customers, I\'ll bet, and 
it shouldn\'t be much of a hardship for IG.  But, again, I probably don\'t 
know what I\'m talking about.

I thought about that last night, and the conclusion I came to was that 
would be a non-optimal solution.  They could put the full data up there 
(the world name and UWP for each world, with a corrected Law Level for 
each world (except good ol\' Sylea - anyone else note that Sylea is the 
only world in FS that has a law level that differs from its government 
type?)), but that would deter people from buying First Survey, Second 
Edition (a hypothetical volume having the corrected data in it).  Or, 
they could just put the world name and law level on the web site, but 
that would be very awkward to use, requiring users to flip back and forth 
between First Survey and the data downloaded from the web site.

I think the JTAS route is best.

I personally would have prefferred that it cover a smaller area and give
more details on individual worlds and/or subsectors.

Well, according to Newtonian physics, there is no limit.  However, we
all know (thanks to general relativity) that this is wrong.  If we
assume a constant fuel burn (and thrust), then as the ship approaches
the speed of light, the acceleration will decrease (due to the relative
increase in mass from relativity).  So acceleration will be zero at the
same moment we reach the speed of light (at time equals infinity).

By definition, the velocity doesn\'t matter (as far as stress on the 
hull), it\'s only the acceleration.  So, if 1G at .1% the speed of light
doesn\'t stress the hull, neither will 1G at 85% of lightspeed.

Thought I would put another log on this fire :)

I have M0, but not FS.  I got it mainly for the background data.  Joe you 
and the guys, and gals, did a kickin\' job!  But when I looked up certain 
worlds like Keshi and Fornol I was confused.  I was trying to think what the 
heck happened to the Chanestin Kingdom on Keshi, I mean Low pop and low 
tech, all I can think of is the Imperials got realy pissed and hammered the 
planet with nukes or Mesons in the latter days of the war.  And whats this 
about Fornol, which had a Premier and everything that got killed by a robot 
and brought up the Shudusham Concords, having a pop of 0 and a tech of 1?

I am currently inputting the M0 core sector data into Gal2.1 editing major 
worlds as I see fit.  I will probably NEVER get FS, but I might get the Year 
Zero Background Hardcover.  Till then I have decided to use the sectors that 
are "Free DM\'s Playing Grounds" for putting my home stuff into them. 
 Zarushagar, Fornast, and Delphi.  As the homeworlds for the aliens in Alien 
Archive cannot be found, I have put them into these \'free\' sectors untill 
such time as their homeworlds are published, if ever.

To keep some degree of integrety to the whole thing I have not haphazardly 
placed stars in these free sectors, Joe Heck\'s Missouri Archives have year 
1100 maps which have worlds in the locations that were in Atlas of the 
Imperium, which I consider to be of major canon.  Mostly due to travel 
ability, and strategic importance.

Using these maps, I have used a system similar to TNE\'s collapse rules or 
MT\'s Hard times, in attempt to put these worlds \'back in time\'.  If anyone 
wants the rules I am working on let me know and I\'ll e-mail them to you.

There was an attempt about a year ago on the Gurps Mailing list. There was
a design or two done (I remember the Gazelle got ported over). I have the
data, I just haven\'t gotten around to getting HTML-ized and up on my

The only limits are light speed, c, and how much risk you want to

Get going to a couple thousand km/s and a sand grain will knock out

The Solomani mounted RIM expeditions. It is mentioned in Rats and Cats.

Grab a copy of the Starflight Handbook for some really groovy data on this
and related topics.

1G = 9.81 meters/second squared.

V = v0 + a t
d = d0 + v0 t + 0.5 a t^2.

Thus, after one hour, starting with zero velocity, at d = 0, we have gone
3600 seconds, and so have a velocity of 9.8*3600 = 35280 m/s (35 km/s), and
have gone 63,504,000 meters.  Since you will likely want to stop at your
destination, you should stop midway, and decelerate.  A two hour trip would
take you some 127,000 km.

Beware, if you are not using magic thrusters, you suddenly need to worry
about how much fuel you are using, and the lower tech the drive, the more
you need to worry.

The big problem is for us people OS. Take Australia for exaple. We look

That is why we get paid the big bucks :)

(While I do not claim to be happy with the resolution on FS from IG thus
far, this is probably sufficient complaints by me in this forum, until they
have a chance to consider their options and react.  :) )

One plus side to this - I am creating a world generation system that is
substantially similar to the MT one in descriptive numbers, but that has
different probabilities.  I have grabbed some data from various references
on human population at various times, and am starting to work out minimum
and maximum populations at each tech level.  This was motivation to get it
working.

I do not want to toss the MT universe, but I do want it to hold together
according to logic and history.  Since each person has a different view of
the latter, and applies the former to different spots, we get different
universes.  Hopefully, they will still be close enough for government work.

When I am done, I will post it, but I expect that is will be only minor
modifications on the usual, such as

TL	Min POP	Max POP
1	~ 10^6		~ 10^7
9	~ 10^8		~ 10^10
12	~ 10^9		~ 10^11

Note: min pop is that population which is within easy travel and
communication.  For a TL9+ culture, it is the worlds within one or two

We gave considerable thought to this subject, although my involvement in the
process was slanted towards military applications (see my organizations of
the Zhodani military forces in JTAS 9 I think...and in the TNE version of
Striker).

Telekinesis has many uses as well. Combined with clairvoyance, it can make
quite a potent weapon. Just before attacking a strongpoint, for example, your
Scrambler (as we called clairvoyant telekenitic talented individuals) does a
quick recce and commences his magic: Imagine yourself sitting in a foxhole,
when your weapon is set to full auto and goes off, all of the pins fall from
the grenades on your belt, and your anti-glare visor changes from the
"normal" setting to the "totally opaque" setting...

OK, whacky game idea--one that I\'m sure that I will never implement.

But, if you want an apocalypse in your game...

There are sudden disturbances in space.  Whole planets and solar 
systems are colliding.

Mass destruction ensues  (No, this is not TNE).

The characters are survivors, and they realize that the planets, and 
even space itself, are really just atoms making up another universe, 
and in that universe, they\'ve just discovered how to split the atom.

In other words, we\'re all just undicovered atomic particles.

Well, they just took a big nose dive in my book.  This not fixing the 
LL=GL thing in FS/M0 is really burning me up.

I\'m trying really hard to have faith in these people, but I feel like 
every time they do something right--the EA, they follow it up with 
something incredibly wrong--this crappy decision to NOT FIX THE DAMN 
DATA after they fuc**d it up in the first place.

Then, there\'s this task system thing.  It was wrong when it came out, 
so they are replacing it with another system that still has problems.

I mean, doesn\'t anybody else out there have a problem with the fact 
that, in T4-revised, you can only roll spectacular failure 
Formidable, Staggering, and Impossible tasks?

I can see Easy tasks--they\'re usually automatic anyway, but what 
about Average and Difficult tasks?  

SF should be a consideration when rolling these--especially Difficult 
ones!

And, since we\'re having a go at the task system again in T4-Revised, 
then why the heck are they including the half die when it is so 
unpopular?

IG, GET RID OF THE DAMN THING.

Ooooo, damn I\'m getting mad about this.

I haven\'t purchased _First_Survey_ (FS), but I *have* looked through it
(at a local games/comics store).  Reading through this and other
supplements of T4, and recollecting the info on this list re: IG\'s policy
on the errata, forcibly brought to mind the following analogy.  


IBM\'s policy on errors:  "Oh, <EXPLETIVE>!!!  Quick!  Print up the errata!
We\'ll send it out as a memo to all our customers and everyone else on our
mailing list.  We\'ll also include it in our technical advisories."  

Microsoft\'s policy:  "<SMIRK>  *That\'s not an *error*, it\'s a *feature*!"  

Steve Jackson Games (SJG) policy:  "Oh, <EXPLETIVE>!!!  Quick!  Print up
the errata!  We\'ll include it with all copies of the game.  We\'ll include
it in the next issue of _Pyramid_.  And let\'s post it on our Web site."  

GDW\'s policy:  "Oh, <EXPLETIVE>!!!  Quick!  Print up the errata!  We\'ll
include it with all copies of the game.  We\'ll also include it in the next
issue of _Challenge_ magazine."  

TSR\'s policy:  "*That\'s* not an *error*, it\'s a *fea--...  Well, it isn\'t 
a *really* bad error...  Oh, all *right*.  We\'ll post a correction in 
_Dragon_ magazine."  

Imperium Games\' policy:  ...What was that decision of theirs, again?  
;-)  *When* did they say they would *correct* FS?  *After* they re-release
the *current* version as a "special edition" with M0?  *Who* does that
sound like?  


Naturally, this is "in my opinion."

Working in m/s is easier -- to get to km/hr, multiply m/s by 3.6.

1 G is taken as 10 m/s^2, i.e., 10 meters per second per second.  The
actual surface gravity of Earth is close to 9.8 m/s^2, but 10 is nearly
identical and makes for much prettier calculations.  Thus, 10 m/s^2 is a
"standard G" in Traveller terms.

Now, the equations.  In each case, the interval involved is \'t\'; the
initial and final values of position are \'p0\' and \'p1\', of velocity \'v0\'
and \'v1\'.  The constant acceleration is \'a\'.  Note that p, v, and a are
all vector quantities, though you can ignore this if all velocities and
accelerations are colinear.

   p1 = p0 + v0*dt + 0.5*a*t^2
   v1 = v0 + a*t

Thus, from a standing start (v0 = 0), the distance travelled |(p1 - p0)|
is 0.5*a*t^2, and the final speed is at.  For example, thrusting at 1 G
for a 30-minute (1800 second) space combat turn from a dead stop, we find
that at the end of the turn,

  d = 0.5*(10 m/s^2)*(1800 s)^2 = 1.62e7 m = 16,200 km
  v = (10 m/s^2)*(1800 s) = 18,000 m/s = 64,800 km/hr = 32,400 km/turn

A useful figure to recall is that, to a first approxmation and neglecting
relativistic effects, lightspeed is one G-year.

In this series, an ancient race that mastered gravity was in the habit of

they would *steal* habitable planets as part of their breeding program...

There was *another* ancient alien race that lived *deep*inside* gravity

The first race fought a war with the second, almost lost, and started

No Joe, FS does NOT have full data...Despite any desperate handwaving
coming from IG, they screwed up and did not put in the proper LAW or GOV
code, whichever it is (since they\'re both the same, I don\'t know which is 
right, now, do I). 

No matter what handwaving the IG does to dispel the fact that FS was
seriously flawed from a players AND a GM\'s viewpoint, short of making the
corrected version available, somewhere, they\'re losing a bunch of T4
players, and worse, evangelists over this. So far I\'ve been told that I
have to REPURCHASE just about everything I\'ve bought, if I want usable
data OR corrections. This is a crappy way to treat customers. 

The essence of whatever interaction your TRAVELLING players have to deal
with, just about anywhere they go is determined first and foremost by
just _two_ codes of the UWP: LAW and GOV. This is how Traveller has always
been, and is an important part of the game mechanic.

Putting out a supplement with such a grave flaw is bad, telling us that a)
oh by the way there IS no law  level, and b) buy the corrected version to
figure out how we handwave our way around this is the equivalent of
Intel\'s reaction to the Pentium floating point bug a few years ago, first 
deny it happened, then tell your customers that they don\'t need to worry
their pretty little heads about it. We KNOW how well that worked, now,
don\'t we??

IG should bite the bullet, and put out errata somehow. They can protect
their investment easily...the online or print version can contain nothing
but the sector name, the hex number and the corrected law level...to make
sense of it, you\'ll still have to have FS or M0, but then you\'ll at least 
be _able_ to make sense of it.

None of this \'Maybe the Imperium has an Agenda\' crap...IG should take one
lesson from GDW, and realize that the GM is not someone to be kept in the
dark..one of THE single most annoying pieces of crap to come from TNE (and
I LIKE TNE, even Virus!) was GDW\'s putting out incomplete or inaccurate
information to the GM...as GM I\'m the one who gets a load of crap on me
from the players when something doesn\'t make sense or suddenly changes.

Sorry to vent like this, and I know that Joe ISN\'T the net-rep for IG
anymore, but maybe some of this mail is filtering through to them.

I\'d say so!  Sheesh.  I bet American companies don\'t like it any more

I\'ve worked through this (with MegaTraveller) and it all comes
down to how close you want to be how they work in Traveller.
In general, you can take the weight and volume of the drive
(or any other component) out of Traveller and just stick
it into a vehicle being designed under GURPS.  Alternately
you just pick the FTL drive that most fits how Traveller
works (I think it is a "hyperspace" drive but I\'m not
sure, GURPS uses a different terminology for types of
FTL drives) and pump up the fuel needs a lot to reflect
the consumption of a Traveller jump drive.  (or not if
you don\'t care if you players need to worry about fuel
as much).

   More to the point, top speed is governed by total fuel-mass available.
(delta-vee)

   A lower acceleration spacecraft might actually have more mass available
to use for fuel, and thus have a higher total delta-vee - resulting in a
higher top-speed.

I only have a few points to raise about what you said.  

1.  Don\'t forget about metallurgical advances in the far future.  
Would it help a blade if it were made of bonded superdense material, 
i.e., material whose molecules are pulled closer together by running 
a current through it?  Striker provides rules for bonded superdense 
armor, but this might make a blade stronger, too.  What about 
crystalliron, or some other metal or alloy "grown" into shape, rather 
than forged and hammered?

2.  Is armor permitted under the Code Duello?  What forms?  
Covering what?  Powered or not?  Who chooses?

3.  Women in the Imperium have total equality with men as a 
matter of law (and longstanding canon).  Noblewomen will therefore 
participate in the conventions of duelling.  How does this affect 
the subject, if at all?  N.B. your comments:

"An ornamental blade would be shorter ... [and] less intrusive 
to _milord\'s_ regal bearing..... keeping the blade under control 
requires the use of your left hand, which could be better served 
holding drinks, hors d\'ouvres, or _milady\'s_ hand.  

"There were also schools of duelling with two-handed swords 
and polearms, for those with _more testosterone than they knew 
what to do with._"

Emphases added.    

4.  The Vilani probably don\'t participate in duels.  They\'d be 
more likely to have a meeting, maybe refer the matter to 
mediation or arbitration, or, in the case of a really grave 
insult, commence a lawsuit.  How does this affect the standing 
of Vilani nobles at court?  There are perhaps some adventure 
hooks here for a political campaign after the Vilani worlds 
join the Imperium.  
        
5.  "What\'s a good solid Imperial Marine Cutlass like? .... Solid is 
the word."  I think that we\'re in accord on Marine blades, except that 
these would certainly make the maximum use of high-tech metallurgy.  
For example, can we make a blade that becomes heavier during a 
downward slash, to add weight to the blow (by turning on the current 
that makes it bonded superdense metal)?

I would find it both interesting and helpful.  University of California 
Press published a definitive book on the Code Duello in France a few 
years ago; you should certainly give it a look.  Also don\'t ignore concepts 
derived from the Japanese duelling culture.  Ben Bova\'s The Duelling 
Machine is an interesting read while you\'re on the subject.  I hope 
that you introduce some really alien elements into your vision of the 
Code Duello, to remind us a few thousands of years have passed since 
today, and that some very different cultures are involved in this game.

That\'s great! and there\'s even some indirect canonical support for 
the concept.  From Secret of the Ancients, we know, for example, that 
the Ancients learned how to pinch off a portion of this universe into 
a pocket universe, and that they also had teleportation portals that 
allowed one to go from point A in this universe through a short 
stretch of a pocket universe to a distant point B.  Jump space itself 
might be a pocket universe or series of pocket universes through which 
we can go, using a jump drive instead of a teleportation portal.

Another cool idea!  If the Ancients created jump space, they only put it
where they were, and we\'re the lucky beneficiaries.  What\'s Vinge?

	Picture this situation, then:

	A J-2 Far trader with an eye for economics fills his tanks half full
for the next jump, which happens to be a one parsec jump. He presses the
big shiny red button, all the fuel in the tank is used, the crystrals
are charged, and off he goes.

	Or does he? 

	If I read it right, the feul is dumped from the tank all at once, then
used/abused/whatever to get the energy needed for jump. The jump
governor then uses that energy in specific patterns to produce the
intended effect - to make the ship go thataway.
	The question is whether or not larger jump drives actually need all
that energy for shorter range jumps, or if that is simply a byproduct of
the combustion/energy generation process. If it is not actually needed,
then the drive could be tricked as above, as long as the governor could
be programmed to handle the lower ammount of energy in the crystals. You
would also see ships with multiple fuel tanks, each holding enough fuel
for J-1, and only using the tankage they need.
	
	Also, what happens to the energy stored in the crystals after 2 or 3
hours? It has to go somewhere...

Maybe they\'re referring to Psionic training being a character generation
step, like undergraduate or graduate scholl, in which case 4 years= 1
term. I am hampered by the fact that my book\'s at home right now, though.

   From the point of view of the ship\'s crew, there is no limit.  "Well,
   what about lightspeed?", you ask.  "Isn\'t that a limit?"  

   Yes and no.  In the reference frame of the stars of known space, you
   are limited to the speed of light.  You can\'t go to a star four
   lightyears away in less than four years.  As you approach the speed
   of light, your acceleration is reduced by the time dialation that
   your ship\'s engines undergo, so you can never acclerate to (or
   beyond) the speed of light.

   But, in the reference frame of the ship, this time dialation is offset
   /exactly/ by the length contraction of the /universe/! In the ship\'s
   reference frame, it is the universe that is moving at some fraction
   of lightspeed, and the distance between your origin and destination
   undergoes a contraction due to relativity.  This length contraction
   allows the effective "speed" of the starship, as experienced by the
   slow-aging ship\'s crew, to be unlimited.

   The upshot of all this is that the distance-time relationships given
   in Traveller are correct for /relativistic/ as well as Galilean
   travel, assuming the point of view of the ship\'s crew.

   To re-iterate: Assuming constant acceleration to midpoint, turnover,
   and then constant deceleration to the destination, the formula is

   T = sqrt( D/(A*16200) )

   where T is time in hours, D is distance in kilometers, and A is
   acceleration in G\'s.  So to travel to Alpha Centauri (about 4
   lightyears away), with a lightyear being about 10 trillion kilometers
   (1.0E+13 km), at one gee, we get

   	T = sqrt( 1.0e13/(1*16200) )
     	  = ~25,000 hours = ~1000 days = 2.8 years

   as the time that passes for the ship\'s crew.

   Figuring out the time that passes for the star systems is a little
   trickier (I can\'t seem to manage to derive the equations), but it
   will be a little longer than the 4-year minimum.

   To cross known space at 6G (500 parsecs, where each parsec is about 30
   trillion kilometers) we get

   	T = sqrt(  500*3.0e13/(6*16200) ) = 3.9e5 hours = 45 years

   ship\'s time.  But 500 parsecs is about 1600 light years, so this
   would take about 1600 years of undialated time.

No, this could be a very bad thing. It could mean the game isn\'t moving and
the dealer wants to shift the stock.

Depends on how the ship is propelled.  If you have something that produces
a constant force sufficient to accelerate at 1G, as determined by the
people on the ship, then there is no upper limit, beyond the usual
relativity ones.  (e.g., after going for a while, you will notice that your
acceleration efforts are going into providing you with higher mass, not
higher v.)  I suspect the dozen atoms per m^3 in hard vacuum are not going
to both you that much, even moving near lightspeed.  (each m^2 will
encounter 3e8 cubic meters of vaacuum per second, which means that you are
hitting ~10^10 particles or so a second, not enough to really slow you down
till you are going as near c as makes no difference.)

One problem you will see, though, is that each electron you hit has become
deadly beta radiation due to the high velocity you impact it with.  How
deadly depends on how fast, but you can likely work it out via the usual
relativity formulas for energy of a particle.

True, but you can get a general gist of the contents and reactions by
listening to the TML in Traveller\'s case...

My point is that other companies in the same market are producing products
that are better quality (certainly in presentation and internal accuracy).
IG is starting to improve, but the duds to hits ratio is bad. IG\'s volume
of output is high - which probably raises expectations on my part. Previous
standards set by GDW and DGP have made products such as FS and Starships a
real disappointment.

This puts me in a dilemma - I don\'t buy everything, but I\'d like to buy
more to support Traveller as a product.

Anyone besides me getting tired of hearing this?  I am a 
firm believer in the right of free speech, in fact I am sworn to 
defend it.  Once is great...twice okay, even three times I can 
understand, but twenty times!?!  This has gone beyond the expression 
of one\'s opinion.

HEY! Grow Up!

You have the right to voice your opinion, but when IG doesn\'t take 
your opinion or position, then move on.  If you don\'t like that they 
didn\'t drop the 3 sided dice Fine!  Won\'t fix FS, Fine!  Don\'t buy IG 
products!  GO write your own game but leave this whining , 
whimpering, drool off the net.  It is a waste of bandwidth.

slight problem.  Between the Solomani and the core, lies the Third
Imperium, who woul;d probably not cotton to allowing a massive expidition
of solomani passage through the Empire.

I believe the Rats concentrated on *Rim* explorations.

I don\'t recall off-hand, but the first survey done by the Imperium wasn\'t 
called First Survey when it occurred, just as World War I wasn\'t called 
World War I until later on.  Was it "The Imperial Grand Survey?"  I 
forget.  But, that\'s my guess as to what the title of that future book 
will be - whatever that first survey was referred to as in its time.

	1G of acceleration tells me nothing about "how fast/how far." To determine
how fast, you have to tell me how long you\'re accelerating. To determine
how far, the answer is forever until it hits something. A few useful equations

	d= distance
	a= acceleration
	v= velocity
	t= time elapsed
	v0= initial velocity (at t=0)

	d= 0.5*a*t^2 + v0*t
	v= a*t

	There\'s a couple of spreadsheets on my web site (yes, they\'re one of the
few things I\'ve had time to get uploaded to the new site), based on the
World Builder\'s Handbook. One of them does starports--ships in port, number
of berths, startown facilities, transportation, warehousing, etc. Right now
all that\'s up is a Mac Excel version, but somebody was kind enough to
update them to Excel95 and email them to me. They\'re on the list for
uploading right after the Second Coming... (of Traveller, that is).

	Yup. Sounds like that\'s one of the books I won\'t be adding to my
collection. Calling a critical error a "feature" just doesn\'t cut it. I
don\'t tolerate that in software, and I\'m not willing to tolerate it in
games, or anywhere else I spend my hard-earned money. But then, I felt
badly burned by "Starships," too. Loyalty to a game only goes so far, and I
don\'t like being p*ssed on and told it\'s rain.

	Compare this to Saturn. One year, they put the wrong engine oil in about
6,000 cars before they caught it. Would have shortened the life of the
engines significantly. Did they just not tell the customers? Did they send
them a bill for the "special oil?" Did they change all their later cars to
use the same oil? Nope. They went out to each and every person who\'d bought
one of those cars, and traded them a brand new car for it. No questions
asked, no depreciation for mileage, "We screwed up, we\'re here to fix it."

	Now, there\'s no way IG can send out replacements for all flawed books. But
trying to PROPAGATE the flaw, and handwave over it is probably the
absolutely WORST thing they could do. The only acceptable solution would be
to fix the data, and print it spread out over three or four JTAS issues.
Note: this has the side benefit of increasing sales of JTAS. Making the
correct LL/GG info available on the net would also be good.

	But I\'m definitely not going to buy a product I already know is just plain
stupidly broke.

Whos to say that he new, or even cared who would be the major races?
Also, your assuming he uses the same gauge we use to measure a major race

It would have been cool if a race was shown that no one knows about on the

he choose the 6 we are familiar with, because these are the six which are

Just musing.

hehehe, sorry I blew your fuse;) did not realise the Jump drive was so

True, why bother with T4, since most of it is crap?  I\'m the original

the re-issues.

"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss"  It seems that the business end
of IG isn\'t really aware of how seriously we take this shit.  I have an
investment of 20 years and hundreds (maybe thousands) of dollars in
Traveller.  To be told that the obvious screw-ups are feature makes me burn.

A bad one.  I will not purchase any more product from IG until I am *sure*
that it is well written and resonably free of stupid mistakes.  They are
losing a customer who has in the past gone to great lengths to be the first
on his block to get the new Traveller material.. now I have a gamestore
that will ship it to me unpaid, and I\'m not interested.  Something is very
wrong here!

Join the club.  I tried like hell to run a campaign under T4.  After four
or five sessions my file of house rules was approaching 12k.  I had to
patch everything!  Then I heard about CORPS, and now I\'m going back to
basics.. A Free Trader in one or two subsectors.

>This is bullshit. Complete, total, bullshit.

>Why the hell do I support a game that keeps treating me this way?

Screw \'em.  I have close to $100 dollars of material, bought in the last
year, that is either unplayable, about to be superceded, or just plain bad.
 It may turn out that IG won\'t get any more money from me.  What\'d I like
is to be able to send my old M:0 and FS in for a trade-in on the M:0
Campaign; but I doubt that\'s going to happen.

>The Babylon Project is looking better and better all the time.

Errr.. there are worse things than T4.. B5-RPG is one of them.

>Am I the only person who feels taken advantage of?

Not at all.  I think of the other things I could have down with my money,
bought my wife flowers, taken her to dinner, bought "You Don\'t Know Jack"
for our \'puter..  It makes me feel like a fool for trusting them this long.

	That depends. If enough people express their opinions, and express them
frequently enough, somebody might listen. It\'s called public opinion, and
it\'s something every business that wants to STAY in business listens to.
Intel didn\'t decide to replace the defective Pentiums until after quite a
few people said loudly and repeatedly "GET RID OF THE DAMN THING."

	So instead of chastising people for trying to improve something they like,
why don\'t you send email to IG, pointing these things out?

From the Traveller Starter Edition (c.1983) page 32, "Ships 
performing jumps less than their maximum capacity consume fuel at a 
lower level based on the jump number used."  I believe that this was 
also the case in the edition of CT Book 3 - Starships that I had (it 
seems to have taken a walk).

IMO, variable jump fuel _is_ "the standard way" in CT/T4.  This is 
because I personally consider GDW\'s published rules to be the 
primary source for how things work in Traveller and other company\'s 
publications to be secondary.  YMMV

No.  You all heard my whining/bitching about IG last year, and while their
products are improving I admit that I wouldn\'t be buying them if I wasn\'t a
Traveller fan from the year CT was first published.  I can live with the task
system (see my fix below), and I\'m ignoring the more retrograde rules (eg.
the reinstatement of fixed range bands into the combat system), but the
casual disregard for already published background (eg. changing prices of
antigrav by an order of magnitude) which change the \'feel\' of the game really
bother me.

Admittedly, part of this is the fact that, as Traveller slowly evolved into a
more hard-science nuts-and-bolts game I changed with it.  My reading tastes
are now far more hard-science than they were when I was a teenager, and old
CT adventures that I loved back then I find silly and boring now.  


I\'ll be running my first B5 game this weekend.  If it goes well, I think I
will switch to a B5/TNE mix, with Space 1889 for when I feel like space
opera.  I like the B5 personal combat system, the character generation system
is excellent for beginners, and (as you say) it has a wealth of _consistent_
background material.

- ----

Rob\'s SIMPLE T4 Task Fix

Divide the characters attribute by the number of tasks he/she/iot is
attempting to do at once.  All other task rules remain the same.  Thus, a
chap talking and driving has his Dexterity cut in half for the skill roles. 
In fact, a chap _listenning_ and driving has the same penalty.  Talented but
untrained beginners had better concentrate!

This makes tasks somewhat harder than they are in a \'stock\' T4 game, but it
rewards skilled players when the fecal matter has encountered the rotational
gas circulation device.

IIRC, the Droyne home world was in the Regina Subsector and is one of the

well i\'d like to say.. that IG is doing a shitty job... and if they expect
us to just bow.. and accept things thats fine.. but not everyone can afford
to keep buying books wich fix\'es there mistakes.. i don\'t know of a game
that the main rules were going to cost me over 60$ for the rules.. let
alone 80$ for M0 and FS
now come one... thats a total of 6 books 140+ for what 3 books
that should have been checked before they were released if 
mistakes were found.... then atleast FIX THEM! were not all
RICH! as for me.. hay T4 is gone from my list... and IG is goto
be the worst company yet.. with mistakes like they make.. no wonder they
can\'t afford to make cheap Fix\'s for us who paid
good money.. for there books.... Marc should have just re-done
CT and made it a bit newer looking.. CT task were okee.. not the best..
combat was easy.. and the products price and clairity were good.. no need
to have 50 pages of bug fixes.. to be printed.. end of story!

High Five Twolf.  

I tried to do this nicely before  but some people just don\'t 
get it.  If you don\'t like Traveller the way IG is taking  it and you
think  you have a better system then by all means go make another game
and good luck.  But stop whining if you cant, go play Vampire they
will love you.

And why  we are on the subject running a new company especially a
creative one like IG takes allot of effort and mistakes are going to
be made  even some bad ones but I still think like most of you
Traveller is the best SF game around.  Ok so we don\'t get data, or we
get screwed up info.  I bet you almost nobody knew there were 30 pages
 missing  in M:0. Remember how much you loved it when it came out. 
 Now we are starting to grip about the pages.  Hey it blows I admit but I
don\'t need them to enjoy the book.

Task systems, now here is one I stayed out of, because  frankly
as a GM I  abuse them to my advantage that\'s what they are  for. 
If you want set percentages play AD&D or Role Master that\'s what all
those Combat tables are for.  If you don\'t like the half die or
another form of die combination then give players difficulty levels
with out the problems and use die modifiers.  It works trust me!!

Canon well this isn\'t it a religion its a GAME people, and Marc isn\'t
God he is a man. If he wants to change things he can its his game he
owns the copy right not you.

As for the other writers at IG I am sure they do their best, but they
cant read 100 books by what 4 companies in 3 different versions and
get things perfect. I know I couldn\'t and I don\'t think you can
either.

And for those of you who are Heretics thank you.  I may not like some
of things you do but its your game.  If I don\'t like your ideas or
game I don\'t have to use them or play in the game.

One last point the money has been spent and things are going to 
happen the way IG sees fit.

That just about dose it for me that\'s a months worth of rant saved 
up.

I feel better

Actually this \'drool\' should serve a purpose, that being to inform IG about 
the standards of their games, and how to please the fans that buy them.

I said \'should serve a purpose\', because IG don\'t seem to listen to their
fans. 

It isn\'t childish - the fact that people are sending these mails to the list
is because they care about whats happening to Traveller.

Here\'s my own little message on the subject. I live in Belfast (Yes, THAT one).
I know 6 people who are heavilly into Traveller. None of them are impressed
by what IG has been putting out. None of them has been impressed by the 
price. None of them has been impressed by the way IG is treating it\'s
Traveller Fans.

There have been breaks in the cloud, CSC and Aliens Archive - but that\'s all
they were - breaks in the clouds, the sunlight soon faded.

IG: 6 traveller fans, none impressed with the way things are going.

Can someone at IG tell us what they are going to do about:
Prices.
Quality.
Errata.

Eamon.

	Yeah, they should be. You have to use the "Unsit" program also posted to
extract them from the archive, and they worked with older versions of
Excel. But there was some problem (I don\'t recall what) loading them into
Excel95. Some kind soul whose name escapes me cleaned them up for Win95 for
me; I just haven\'t posted those.

Dave,

I have tried using the unstuffit using LF conversions and no conversions.
When I try and open it with or without updating links I get garbage. I am
using Excel 97 for Winblows 95. Could you try save them as sylk files and
send them to me uncompressed?

Vernor Vinge, science fiction author (and a very good one).  In his _A
Fire Upon the Deep_ (which I *highly* recommend), he posits that the core
of the galaxy is surrounded by concentric very roughly spherical shells in
which physical laws get less and less restrictive.  Terra sits in the
\'slow zone\', between the *very* restrictive core and the \'beyond\' where
most civilizations live.  In the slow zone, c is a hard speed limit; in
the beyond, it\'s not, and other neat tricks work as well.  As you move
outward things get looser and weirder until you reach the \'transcend\', the
outermost region, in which deity-like beings dwell, some rather hostile,
some helpful.  It\'s a lovely setup, and a great story; it also is at least
marginally useful as Traveller source material.

His _Across Realtime_, though less Traveller-useful, is even better IMHO.
It\'s really two novellas with some connective material, but the whole
thing works well as a novel.

is excessive? If the \'main\' ship is on full accel. and in a high-g
\'spin\' the effective force on the grapple could exceed 100g if the ship
has to maneuver. And what if a missle hits the far end of your
\'whirlagig\'?).
Two) The grapples are capable of holding ANY SHAPED vessel of the
tonnage, right? The builders don\'t necessarily know the shape of the
ship or the desired placement. Sphere, needle, up, down, it can be
grabbed so the ability to grab it requires a great deal more space than
is used individually - I think the \'footprint\' numbers you give are
great - but the grapple probably still needs all of that area.

	Actually, fifty customers complaining fifty times constitutes a lot more
public opinion than fifty customers complaining once.

	And it doesn\'t count as one person complaining many times, if the core of
each complaint is different. Complaining about the task system, and then
complaining about the M0/FS screwup isn\'t whining, even if you repeat your
complaint about the task system at the same time. Lawyers might call that
establishing a pattern of behavior on IG\'s part.

I\'ve worked through this (with MegaTraveller) and it all comes
down to how close you want to be how they work in Traveller.
In general, you can take the weight and volume of the drive
(or any other component) out of Traveller and just stick
it into a vehicle being designed under GURPS.  Alternately
you just pick the FTL drive that most fits how Traveller
works (I think it is a "hyperspace" drive but I\'m not
sure, GURPS uses a different terminology for types of>FTL drives) and pump
up the fuel needs a lot to reflect
the consumption of a Traveller jump drive.  (or not if
you don\'t care if you players need to worry about fuel
as much).

Not the case - there are several sophonts in the Spinward marches alone -

Yes it can (sort of, the perceived acceleration by an outside observer
would start to slack off as it approached lightspeed but those in the ship
would not notice it). There was some thought on the list about speed
problems for ships due to hitting solar wind particles with higher and
higher energies. Solar wind particles travel at about the same speed as a
ship with 1G accelerating for 1 day would have. So if you boost for 2 days
you\'d get about x4 energy from solar wind particles and so on.

There was a system in one of the Journals but I think they seriously
underestimate the number of ships. I had a system based on Pop and port
type but cannot seem to find it anymore - I\'ll post it if I dig it up.
BTW Does anybody remember the old White Dwarf article about starports with

use it? I am about to make detailed maps on those parkbays and possibly
also some 3D renderings to show the players.

This is even more sinister. Grandfather doesn\'t care or know about the six
races he picked on the Coyns later development of j-drives on their own,
neither did he help them do it. This implies that whatever method
grandfather used to pick these six races out of I\'d say several hundred
sentient races at the time also with 100% hit rate nailed them as
independent j-drive developers. What strange innate ability does the major
races have that grandfather could detect that is ESSENTIAL to inventing
j-drives. This leads credence to the racist theory that somehow minor races
really are inferior and could NEVER have developed j-drives themselves.

Enough to put even a Virushi into berserker rage.

Look at CSC undoubtedly the best from IG so far. Then you scratch a little
on the surface and what: A design system that negates lots of what has been
said about M0, armour rules that are incompatible with EVERYTHING, TL 15
first Imperium artifacts etc.

It seems IG decides on a name of a product, waits until 1 month before
going to the printers and calls somebody with lots of cred in the game
business but with NO knowledge of Traveller to whip it out then gives the
artjob to the lowest bidder and doubles the cover price to make up for low
volume. I do NOT believe that Marc or the other guys at IG ever play T4 -
they shure hadn\'t playtested T4 otherwise they\'d noticed the 2.5D6
stupidity after 5 minutes of gaming.

IMNSHO T4 will never be fixed or OK or anything neither from IG nor from us
at the list but that is fine with me as it saves me a bundle and I can work
up something myself.

This has been bugging me for some time now and I can\'t think of another way

I assume this is the same Roger Macbride Allen who writes the supposedly

Nothing in *either* lot of books suggests this is the case but the

writing \'continuations\' of other people\'s work.)

As my wife and I can never usually find an author we both enjoy [1]

Interesting point...  I had just assumed that they didn\'t develop low-berth

That\'s possible -- but the history, as I read it, seems fairly clear that
the Consolidation Wars happened _because_ of technology leakage across the
borders and the Vilani desire to forcibly bring those peoples inside the
control of the Ziru Sirka.  They did indeed keep the Jump-2 drive secret:
that was the "secret weapon" that let them win the Consolidation Wars.

Haven\'t gotten there yet.  I envision some race right on the edge of the
rift at the rimward edge of Ilelish, since there\'s a small outgrowth of
the mixed-bureaux area there.  But Ilelish is very notably devoid of much
news or history in the Traveller universe.

There is, actually, a Droyne world located about a subsector spinward of
Ilelish, according to the CT Alien Module.  I\'ve wondered whether they
would make the Droyne-Ancients connection, but I think that bypasses the
mystery that\'s supposed to last until 1100 Imperial.

Your point, however, is a good one.  I\'ll check out the nearby world data
and see if anything cries out for a minor race.

Oh, but of course.  I just wanted to show that Naasirka might support it
more whole-heartedly, being the only bureau without a border to expand
through.

Exactly, which explains why, despite extensive STL and then jump-drive
colonization for thousands of years, the Suerrat are no longer a major
ethnic group in the region (Dlan sounds pretty Vilani/Solomani dominated
by the time of the Rebellion).

I noted that, but the math for the closer orbit (from DGP\'s Worldbuilder\'s
Handbook)  ended up making the planet woefully hot.  So either the
planetary-temperature math or the habitable-zone table are wrong. 
Personally, given how much brighter an F4 is than our own G2, I have no
trouble believing Ilelish needs to be out in a Jupiter-size orbit. 

Before someone brings it up, since the footnote in the original word-
processor document didn\'t make it into ASCII, let me point out that the
"canonical" sector data gives Ilelish a M0 D sun.  Yeah, right.  HIWG
library data gives the Suerrat homeworld as Volomil/Miitan, which appears
as Vesper in the sector data with a F4 D sun.  I throw out these
"canonical" items, first since I think it\'s ludicrous to try to detail
every world in areas never described in any depth in existing Traveller
literature, and second because it contradicts what development work there
is (I _could_ do a minor human race that evolved in orbit around a white
dwarf... but not this time around).  So I\'ve taken the spectral type from
Volomil but the location of Ilelish and "turned the sun up" to a main-
sequence stellar class.

I like both your points (high CO2 and endemic disease), and will consider
them.  My "take" on the taint didn\'t make it into the uploaded version of 
the write-up.  As I envisioned it, pre-Ilelish revolt the taint consists
of a profusion of pollen, etc. from the local flora that can cause severe
allergic reactions in non-native humans.  Post-Ilelish revolts its air-
borne dust from the equatorial deserts created by Imperial orbital
bombardment.  :-)

Hm, more developed turbinates to catch and hold pollen?  (Suerrat sneeze
frequently?)  I like it....

If there\'s no other way to get there, but you\'re hot to go, you take
what\'s available.  Patience doesn\'t enter into it, except in trying to
design your STL vessel to go as fast as possible....  But, yes, I envision
a certain amount of stubborness as well.

Basically, as you can probably tell, I\'m setting up the Suerrat as a
minority with obvious reasons to be disliked and oppressed (strange
feet, weird sex and don\'t wear clothes, "lazy," "impulsive," etc.),
which can feed back to give them plausible reasons to be "villains"
in a Milieu:0 setting or later.

Actually not. You can kill people with blunt trauma. In movies as in most
RPGs there is a sharp distinction between penetrating and blunt damage. In
the real world(tm) however blunt trauma can also kill but not as easy. If
you\'re hit by a car or fall off a building you get hurt from blunt trauma
which can both kill you instantly or make you bleed to death.

I have previously mentioned on TML that I have a system currently under
construction for randomly generating starport types, sizes and details such
as number of ships of various sizes, etc. We at CORE were hopefully going to
include this in the upcoming Starports and Cities book, however a
page-down-sizing situation means that it won\'t be, so instead, it should
appear in the nearish (Oct 2003) future as a 101 book from BITS. However, it
does assume that you have generated more details about a system than are
given in the basic T4 rules - i.e. more like the WBH type detail. It also
covers things like multiple starports on a world, in-system transport
between multiple planets, etc. To coordinate with that, I am hoping to issue
a 101 book to cover some more of that level of detail of planetary systems.

        That is indeed a big problem. After a careful examination of the
data in Massilia sector (sorry, I devote myself to one sector: no time for
more), I noticed that there is an easy way to fix it. It works pretty well
for Massilia sector, but may not be good for other sectors (after all, the
Vland data has the "dozens of worlds at TL 0 with good starports" problem,
and other sectors not, so there ARE differences).

        Anyway, the fix is the following:

============================================================================
========
        Warning: Heretic rule creating non-canon, alternate M0 Universe
============================================================================
========
        Take all worlds with starport B
        1) If the World is Barren, then change starport to X (and TL to 0)
        2) If the World is Low Pop, then change starport to E (and decrease
TL by 4)
============================================================================
========

        It\'s really amazing how this simple manipulation of the data changes
the appearance of the sector. After it, the look of Massilia is really what
it should be in M0. Two problems were: Too much B starports, and many of
them in Low Pop or Barren worlds. AND: too few E starports, and NO X
starports. This change solves both, and it\'s easy. Gosh, the Shokee sector
has just three or four important worlds, and the rest are Barren or LoPop in
FS, but almost all of them have B starport. After the change, the subsector
is simply a backwater, almost unexplored one, with a cluster of developed
worlds in the coreward part (near the Geonee Confederation).
        Other subsectors in Massilia have a better appearance after the
change. I haven\'t checked other sectors.

        Of course, after this fix, you are heretic, as FS is now *canon*,
but... who cares? The point is, if you want to change the data to something
more appealing, this *rule of thumb* is quick and really improves things.
Maybe a simple set of rules of thumb could fix most of the problems in FS...

        ...and the data in the second half of FS is what the Imperium
"normal" agencies know. The data for Vland is ***TOP SECRET***, and not even
the imperial bureaucrats have access to the real figures. And why is it so?
Because Vland is far away from the Imperial core in Year Zero, and so it\'s
in an exposed situation. The Vilani wanted to keep secret their real
economic and military potential, and so they declared the pop figure SECRET.
The Imperium agreed with it, and the real data is only known by certain
agencies. You go to Vland, and there are clearly more than one thousand of
millions of people there, and you ask, "Hey, I have this data here, and it
says the Pop is low!", and you are told "You are not cleared for this
information. Please come with us, we have to talk to you".
        In my universe, Vland is going to be Hi Pop, that\'s for sure.

Bingo!
As a DM, i need full maps to get inspired. When i *Create*, i look at 
the map (of the SM), look at the starlanes, the world names and the 
starports and slowly, ideas form! But incomplete maps dont do that 
for me!

their product and promoted it everywhere, and second that there 
wouldn\'t be any errata, since we on the TML did all the work of 
finding the problems and pointing them out to IG!
And for this effort to make their product better, we are in fact 
being punished by IG. That\'s not fair and no wise approach for a 
company that relies to a big extent on us oldtimers to push their 
product...

materials: I\'m assuming that IG is going to get its act together and
re-release improved and re-edited materials at some point a la White Wolf,

	In the meantime, I\'m doing up another campaign, titled "Traveller:
Beyond the Pale" (What with my players, I figured that I might as well
acknowledge the inevitable in the title :>) using Ken Bearden\'s KB V2.0,
Glenn Grant\'s hit location table, the SSDS & VDS beta .pdfs for ship &
vehicle design, and FF&S for little details such as honking big handguns
and alternate tech spacecraft.  I\'ve done my own subsectors (it\'s going to
be set in a small cluster of G&K type stars about 6 parsecs into the Rift
in Vland sector) based on Ethan Henry\'s subsector viewer.  I\'ve been trying
to use Rob Prior\'s Metator, but since I\'ve been plagued by crashes I\'ve
gone and used Accrete to generate systems, fleshed out by use of
MegaTraveller world generation systems.

	To be honest, as a newbie, I\'m pretty disappointed by T4.  Had I
gone about re-launching Traveller, I would have simply done it in the
following order: 1) get as perfect a set of mechanics as possible worked
up, with a good task system, integrated design systems, and so forth, 2)
collate all the incredible wealth of background info that has been done for
this game over the past 20 years, and 3) release.  Milieu and other
supplements and so forth would come next...

	As it is I\'m seeing generally blah products that don\'t do justice
to what went before.  So until IG gets its act together I\'m going to
continue winging it as I\'m doing now.

	BTW, some of you may recall I posted session synopses of our last
campaign on a regular basis.  Anyone want to see these again for this round
of carnage?

He is psionic !

Yes he could have helped the major races but why would he want to. 
Since we know that the Ancient artifact the Zhodhani have that prompted
them to do the Core Expiditions gives accurate representations of the
future is it really so hard to imagine that Yaskodray knew they were
going to be important later & stuck pictures of them on the coyns to
help socialize the Droyne about who they were going to have to deal
with.

He psionically saw then ruling whole sectors of space & figured that
made them important enough to stick on the coyns.

How about the Darmine in Zarushagar ?  It may be a bit rimward of what
you were thinking of but I think they would go well, it is in the mixed
bureaux area. I have had a clear image of them in my mind for a while
that I have been meaning to write up & your excellent work has
prompted me to start.

MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia says (and Joe Heck\'s Missouri
Archive repeats)

Darmine

Cultural region in the Zarushagar sector. Darmine had a separate but
submerged cultural identity within the First Imperium and happily
threw off that domination when the First Imperium fell. 

Allowed to flourish by the Rule of Man, the community of worlds
survived the Long Night with little harm. Darmine was the major
focus of the Ilelish Pacification Campaign (76 to 120).

MT\'s Referee\'s Manual shows (pg 102 Cultural regions of the
Imperium) that the Darmine cultural region occupies
subsectors K, L, O, & P of Zarushagar.

Clayton R Bushes Traveller racelist says
 
MINOR HUMAN RACE      SOURCE*                    HOMEWORLD
- ----

*Darmine            Darmine cultual region     Zarushagar
1323         								        Ishag/Liasdi

(an * indicates unofficial data)

DGP\'s Second Survey Data says

Ishag         1323 B525966-A  N Hi In              515 Im G1 VI

(although that star really should be changed to G1 V not G1 VI)

When I saw this data the first thing I wondered about was the 
atmosphere, while it is not inconceivable that a minor human
race could exist on a planet with a very thin tainted atmosphere
it seemed a bit implausible.

Therefore I decided that Ishag\'s atmosphere used to be a type 7
standard density tainted.  The Vilani had repressed the Darmine
quite a bit after conquering them & had started to exploit the
planet rather extensively.  Through a means I have not yet 
determined the Vilani managed to destroy more than 75% of the 
planets atmosphere & most of its population both Darmine and
Vilani settler (possibly they discovered the Ancient site
that must have been present on a minor races home planet & 
pushed the wrong button).  The Darmine were pretty upset with 
the Vilani over this as you can imagine & the Vilani blamed 
the Darmine for their deaths & financial setbacks.  Many
Darmine left Ishag at this point to live & work on more
habitable planets.  They filled a role somewhat akin to that
played by Jews in Europe or ethnic Chinese in southeast asia,
a discriminated against minority who were disproportionally
merchantile.  The Vilani did not welcome the competition and
Darmine/Vilani animosity grew to become hatred.

Ishag is a small world only 7442 km in diameter that managed
to retain an Earthlike gravity (1.03 g) and atmospheric
denisty (formerly 1.1 atmosphere now 0.286 atmosphere) 
only by virtue of its very high density of 1.7.  Ishag is very
metal rich, especially in copper.  These metals will poison
any non Darmine who eats crops grow in its soil or breathes
its air without a filter.  Darmine heavy metal tolerance tends
to be about 20 times higher than that of other human races.
Darmine chelate out most of this metal due to Ancient genetic
engineering.  Some of these metals, especially the copper, show
up in their hair & fingernails.  This leads to the distincive
(and attractive) blue or green haired appearance common among
Darmine.  If a Darmine does not ingest enough copper their
hair will fade to a whiteish blonde.

Most Darmine are followers of the Telor faith which has been
the single most important factor in their lives.  The Telor 
faith is a polytheistic one (World Builders Handbook profile
34A888-A)  Telor has some structural similarities to Hinduism
and is primarily focused on the number four.  To a believer it
is almost a sure thing that _anything_ that happens in fours (or
multiples or fractions of 4) has an inner meaning that should be
thought about.

I will post more on the Darmine soon (I hope) & welcome comments
on this.

I would have to say (in order): Yes, Not Necesarily, Yes

If a significant percentage of a ship\'s mass is fuel, then acceleration
will go up by a significant percentage as the fuel goes from "full" to
"empty."

Since this is a changing value, etc. (and also because if you go fast
enough, the effects of relativity become noticable), you\'d definitely
need at least some basic integral calculus, and with relativity figured
in, things would get pretty complicated--your relative mass would be
decreasing as your fuel is consumed, but increasing as your velocity
approaches lightspeed.

	I have a couple questions, though:

	1) How do you handle DMs as presented in T4 or MM\'s fixed system? In
T4, they are roughly equivalent to 1 skill or attribute level, but since
KBv2.0 weights these differently, are the DMs weighted as well? It seems
to me as if the effects of these DMs falls off drastically as the
difficulty increases - more dice to roll, and less of a change
(percentage wise) in the target number. Should we triple them? This
would make them as important as skill levels. While I think things like
scopes and such are valuable aids, they don\'t really have the ability to
replace training. Maybe double then? More weight than stats, less than
skills? 

	2) Experience - If I read your system right, characters advance by
skill levels, rather than experience levels. This gives a rather coarse
experience curve - by jumps of three. 
	I think a rather interesting idea, which would smooth this out
somewhat, is to roll against 1/3 experience, but only add 1 experience
level. This would smooth out the curve a bit, and, if you increase
experience awards to reflect this change in cost, would allow a greater
flexibility in handing out experience. Jack of all Trades advances would
cost three times as much, and be rolled against the current level. This
would represent the difficulty in advancing knowledge in many subjects
simultaneously.

	Comments, anyone?

I\'ve absconded with copies of them and put them uncompresses into my

I changed the naming of the files so my web server would know to specify
them as Excel spreadsheets, which might cause problems for them, but

which I renamed to "WBH.xls".

What? There\'s _lots_ of evidence.

The Vilani - their whole planet is _crawling_ with ancient artifacts.
 The Genoee (sp?) got their jump drives from ancient artifacts, that\'s
 a "known" fact. The entire major/minor race thing is based on who 
 invented jump drive themselves and who copied it from artifacts.
 The Vilani have an aconomic and socialogical reason to institute the
 whole major/minor race thing, but nothing says that they had any
 justification for it whatsoever.

The Solmani - hm, discovered Ancient Artifacts in the asteroid belt
 and on some Jovian moons, discovers jump drive in the same place...
 Hmmmm... coincidence?

The Aslan - they copied it from a crashed Solmani ship! It\'s not even
 an ancient one, directly.

The Hivers - they developed the "inferior" jump drive by themselves,
 but after a few hundred years of exploration, one day, poof! A new,
 better jump drive! How about they discovered an Ancient site
 and "upgraded" their drives.

The Vargr - they were _created_ by the Ancients. Life-like Vargr-type
 Ancient androids still walk among them checking up on them. Vargr
 historical records, are, well, an oxymoron. Who knows how the Vargr
 got jump drives? It\'s doubtful that most Vargr even know.

The Zhodani - their encounters with droyne gave them psionics, they
 too have Ancient sites right on their homeworld - what are the odds?

The K\'kree - who knows? They\'ve been known to commit genocide on the basis
 of dietary preference. They\'ve got a story about how they invented
 jump drive and if you\'ve got proof otherwise, they\'ll not only rub you
 out, they\'ll destroy your entire race.


Anyways, based on evidence and hints in all the Alien modules, I\'d
say that it\'s more likely that Grandfather was the first and last being
to independently discover jump drive. Also, everyone discovered jump-1
but it took the Imperium (well, all 3 Imperia actually)  about, what,
6,000 years to go from jump-1 to jump-6? Gee, maybe jump drive
scientists don\'t know what the hell it is they\'re working with! In all
likelyhood, they had to completely reverse-engineer the whole thing
to make any progress on it at all... which could a serious amount
of time and brainpower. Grandfather was smart enough that it wouldn\'t
surprise me if it took thousands of humans thousands of years to
figure out just _one_ of his inventions.

Uh, the thing is that the Solomani core expeditions have a kinda
funny name - "Trip to the Imperium".

Solomani space is _rimward_ of Imperial space. Imperial space is
therefore _between_ the Core and Solomani space. TO get around
Imperial space, you have to go through Hiver space or Aslan space, or
off the maps of known space. 

The Solomani have done a lot of exploring _rimward_ as Bruce (I believe))
mentioned, but _coreward_? Nope, not much.

While laboring away on the Stairmaster at my company gym yesterday, I was
reading a copy of last week\'s Time magazine. There was an article on a
discovery made by astronomers that a huge antimatter surge is spouting from
the core of the Milky Way. The graphics seemed to indicate that this
antimatter is shooting up at an almost perpendidular angle from the plane
of the galaxy.

Scientists speculate that this may have resulted from a number of things,
including:

o  A high incidence of novas near the core, a likelihood considering the large
   number of ancient stars there. However, the high incidence would apparently
   have to be _really_ high!

There were several more ideas including some black hole theories.

Maybe we can draw some real-world astronomy into the realm of Traveller
history. Just what _is_ sending that antimatter energy out? Could be those
Baddies!

Best,

	Bingo! But Traveller ignores that little fact, because it would be too
complicated for most people. And if you\'re using thruster plates, it\'s less
relevant because you\'re not expending reaction mass. For techheads, the
equation is 

	Total Delta V = Exhaust Velocity * ln( Final Mass / Initial Mass)

Well, I\'m gonna be one of the 50 people, and I\'ll just complain once.

Making a business decision to not correct obvious errors in IG\'s
products and trying to cover it up with new rules and various
bullshit is going to put IG out of business. It\'s a shity decision
and while I had planned to buy the new M0 book, now I probably won\'t,
knowing that IG is just to lazy to bother fixing their mistakes.

Companies in all sectors live and die on customer relations. Eatons,
troubled as they may be by bad management these days, was built from
a corner store to the one-time third largest employer and the largest
retailer in Canada on the basis of one promise : "Good satisfactory
or money refunded".

I _dare_ IG to offer a satisfaction-guaranteed policy on their 
products. I know they won\'t do it because they know no one would
keep their stuff for a day after having read it cover to cover.

I love Traveller, but IG, as a company, seems to be making some pretty
stupid, cheap, short-sighted decisions. Somebody thaw out the frozen
watch at IG headquarters and let them have a crack at it.  They couldn\'t
do any worse.

And nobody better tell me to shut up, \'cause that\'s all I have to say 
on the subject.

	And it might even increase sales of JTAS--everybody who made the mistake
of buying the original would now be interested in getting the correct data.

It was pointed out to me (i.e. a sharp stick was stuck into parts of my
anatomy normally reserved for my favourite masseuse) that my previous
posting on my random generation of starports stuff might have sounded a bit
negative towards the outstanding upcoming Starports and Cities product due
out from IG and (naturally) being written by two of our own best hand-picked
CORE writers. I have every confidence that this should be an excellent and
very useful product and I did not intend to detract from it in any manner.

My previous posting was merely indicating that the rules that I generated
about 4-5 years ago for random starport generation, which I had mentioned
some months back on TML, would *not* (as was originally discussed within
CORE) be appearing in this IG product, and therefore since I would retain
full copyright to such generation procedure, I might take the opportunity to
put out said rules at some later date, in some form or other.

Hope that clears up any potential misunderstandings.

  },
  {
    'body' => 'Well, I have been relatively silent over the last two months, and it seems
recently that many people have come to the same conclusions that I have come to.

Let me back up...

About two months ago, it became obvious that Traveller was taking too much
of my time.  Or rather, that there were so many things in my life taking
time that one (or more) of them would have to be left behind.  The lot fell
to Traveller.  I began thinking about giving up Traveller, and at first, it
sorrowed me greatly.  I debated giving up something else instead, but it
always turned out that Traveller was at the bottom of the totem pole, and
was the one destined to get the axe.

As I thought further on this, I realized that I wasn\'t so upset about giving
up Traveller as I thought at first.  This puzzled me, because I have always
loved Traveller.  The concept is incredible.  So, I thought some more.

While this thinking was going on, I started the auction that some of you
have participated in.  I was selling off my stock of Traveller goodies (and
not so goodies).  Sometime during this auction I realized why I wasn\'t
loathe to leave Traveller behind.

You see, I realized that I was experiencing something of the "abused-wife
syndrome."  Now, before anyone curses me for attempting to compare my plight
with that of those poor wives with serious (read:real-life) problems, let me
explain.  To do that, come back with me into the past.

The setting, January 1996.  There I sat, at my office.  Having recently
gotten access to the Internet, I was pleased to find that there was much
about Traveller to be explored and exploited.  I had personally just added
all but the last five books to my TNE collection, when... Oh NO!!!  This
CAN\'T BE!!  GDW to close its doors?   Say it ain\'t so!

I searched for more clues, but everywhere I went, I found the same answer.
GDW was going out of business.  I called GDW and quickly ordered the final
five TNE books (I have explained before that I am a TNE-man).  My volumes
arrived on (or near) that fateful day.  GDW\'s doors were closed.  My world
was black.  The only light came from the fact that Traveller would live on
with its fans.

But wait!  There was another glimmer of light.  "All rights for Traveller
will revert to Marc Miller."  YES!!!  I had not had the pleasure of owning
much of CT or MT, but I had seen (and more importantly, played) enough of it
to know that this man, the creator, would certainly not let the vision die.

He didn\'t, and before long, we were anxiously awaiting the New Traveller.
During that time, I had joined the mailing list.  (I spent many a fretful
night wondering what YARS had to do with Traveller, but that is another
story.)  Finally the day came, T4 had arriven in a store near me.  I must
admit, I was rather ambivalent about not receiving my hardback first.  On
the one hand, it meant the soft cover would get the initial reading wear and
tear.  On the other hand, it meant something was amiss in the shipping of
the Hardbacks.

The hardback finally did arrive, but by then, the damage had been done--I
had begun reading the soft cover T4.  I admit, the major turn-off for me was
that I was used to the extended TNE rules and T4 was VERY simplified from
TNE.  But, and what a but it turned out to be, there were also errors in T4.
But this Mailing List, they were quick to respond, they began collecting all
the errors in one place for future publication on the internet.  This was
good.  No, it wasn\'t great anymore, but it was still good.

Then, the proverbial doo-doo hit the proverbial fan.  In a word: Starships!
Well, so the doo-doo wasn\'t so proverbial.  OK, I\'m a gearhead!  I admit it,
and I refuse to seek help. :)  What was it, September that Starships was
originally due out?  Then November, then December.  IIRC, I finally got a
copy in late December/early January.  And what a waste of money!!!  I was
really glad that I never found time to do any ship write-ups for Don, and
that the sidebar info that I did send in didn\'t make it in the book.  I
didn\'t wany my name anywhere near it!

Starships was CRAP!  But, again, the wonderful Mailing List came to the
rescue of IG and created the eratta for Starships.  Here, Dave Golden and
Guy Garnett deserve mention.  Between the pair, I had something I could use.
Granted, it was downloaded the fixed versions of their creations from the
internet and not from the books I bought, but It was something I could use
anyway.

About the same time came another new book, JTAS25.  Now, this one, we had
all been building up for.  I mean, even I, a Traveller late-comer, knew of
the glories of JTAS.  Perhaps one of the best game mags ever.  I opened
JTAS25 and gawked!  What was this?  Yeah, there were some good stories, but
it was definitely not Traveller.  FTL communications???  Give me a break!!!

Following this, Supplements started flowing out.  (I chose the term flowing
in reference to the way water flows after you\'ve drained pipes and then
refill them.  Pop, sputter, Pop, flow, sputter, pop.)  Lets look at some of
these...

Central Supply Catalogue:  This was finally a supplement that was worthy of
being called Traveller.  Or was it?  As was mentioned here before, the idea
and presentation was great, the errors were few, but the entire design
system didn\'t mesh with anything that had gone before.  Oops.  The good
news:  At least the eratta was small enough that it could be put on the web.

Aliens Archive:  To be honest, I never even read this one.  When you
approach a game like Traveller with a vast history and you publish a book
about alien races and don\'t include a single race that makes up the majority
of that history you\'ve made a mistake in my book.  Now I\'m no expert, but I
do know what I like, and this book didn\'t make me want to read it.

Mileau 0:  After long waiting, a supplement that was usefull that didn\'t
seem to contain too many errors.  IG had done well in employing people who
knew about the game to do the writing.  Good work and Kudo\'s go out to Andy
Lilly, Joe Walsh, Stu Dollar, and the other who worked on this project.
Unfortunately, IG got their hands on the project before it went to print.
We ended up with a volume that was missing pieces and parts.  In addition...

First Survey:  This book didn\'t agree with what Mileau 0 was telling us.
Further, after examining it in more detail, the Law Level and Government
codes were identical.  To me, though, the lowest blow was the realization
that this project was the work of Marc Miller himself.  Now whether the
blame for the boo-boo belongs on Mr. Miller or on IG (again) remains to be seen.

Citizens of the Imperium:  I thought, even though I never did get to see any
of this, it deserved a mention here.  This was promised, when?  January?  I
think that\'s right.  Well, is anyone in this fan club yet?

JTAS26:  Well, to IG\'s credit, they have decided to hold this one back to do
it right.  I\'m not really sure at this point that IG knows what right is,
but perhaps they will stumble into something.

I never got Emperors Arsenal, I was in the midst of an auction before it
came out.

Now, to add insult to injury, there were a few announcements made while
these supplements were being sent out.  There were basically three that
deserve mention...

Traveller Deluxe: "Hey Traveller Fans on the Mailing List, guess what?
Remember all those errors you found in our main book?  Well, we\'ve taken
them off our web page and used them to create another book you can buy!
That\'s right, rather than be decent and admit when we\'ve made a mistake, we
are going to try and turn another profit on your trust.  Announcing T4
Deluxe!  Oh, yeah, we\'ll add a few little things here and there to make you
feel like you are getting something new for your money, but don\'t worry, it
won\'t be anything major.  Well except for the ship design system.  You see,
that QSDS thing that everyone likes, well, since it is available for free on
the Internet, we can\'t make a buck on it.  So, we\'ve gotten Mr. Marc Miller
to agree to come up with a new ship design system that you can\'t get
anywhere but from us."

New Starships:  "Wowie and Zowie, we\'ve come up with yet another way to turn
a buck!  You remember that CRAP we suckered you all into buying?  Yeah, it
was called Starships.  Well, we\'ve taken the eratta that you compiled, added
a few VITAL NOTES AND COMMENTS so that you will feel like you are missing
something if you don\'t get them, and we\'re going to publish it as the New
Starships.  You remember how aweful we screwed up the deckplans?  Well,
we\'re going to do them right this time.  What?  Oh, don\'t worry, trust us.
We know how to do them right, we don\'t need to show you what we mean by
right (snicker)."

M:0 Campaign:  "Check this out, Traveller fans.  We\'ve gotten Twenty pages
of material that was either left out of M:0 or was written new (We\'re not
really sure which) that we are going to put in a new book.  We are also
going to put that junk from First Survey in there too so we can charge more.
Huh?  NO! Why would we want to fix the Law Level?  What\'s wrong with it?
Oh?  It\'s the same as the Government Code?  Well, uhm, that\'s, uhm, well,
uhm, going to, uhm, be explained, uhm, in, uhm, the Thirty new pages of
material, yeah, that\'s it.  Huh? what?  Oh, yeah, so I did say twenty
earlier, well, that was just a slip of the tongue."


Now, back to where I started.  The reason, I said, that I wasn\'t too upset
about leaving Traveller behind, was because I had a bit of the "abused-wife
syndrome."  Now, let\'s look at this.  What is the "abused-wife syndrom"?
Well, I can think of three things that are involved.

1. The wife is abused.
2. The wife is raped, or in other ways taken advantage of.
3. The wife loves the husband but hates what he does.

Now, carry the analogy out with me.  Consider that I am like the wife, and
Traveller is like the Husband.  IG controls Traveller (with Marc\'s
Permission). So, if what I was experiencing was like the "abused-wife
syndrome" then...

1. I am abused.  Considering what IG has tried to push off on me a decent
material, I would say that my intelligence has been abused.  My pocket-book
has certainly been abused.  Not to mention the insult of the three "new"
products I mentioned above.
2. I am raped, or in other ways taken advantage of.  Again, reference the
lack of money in my wallet from spending it on overpriced game supplements.
3. I love Traveller, but Hate what IG has done with it.

And so, I am faced with the fact that I am not that displeased to be giving
up Traveller.  I regret that things have come this far, but that\'s the way
it is.

I will still be around here because, there is one bright note, however.
THUDDD.  While I no longer feel adequate to run THUDDD, with QSDS and SSDS
from the Internet, I can compete.  I am, afterall, still a Traveller fan and
still a Gearhead.  


MESSAGE TO MARC MILLER:

I\'m not sure if you will get this or read any of it, but here it is anyway.

Well, it has been over a year since Traveller became yours again.  It has
been almost a year since it the first T4 books went out.  You promised us
something back then when you first got Traveller back that I think many (if
not all) of us have forgotten.  You said that since there were so many
different opinions as to where Traveller should go, you were going to do
with it what _you_ wanted.  If we liked it, we could come along, but if not,
you were doing what you wanted.

This is a simple question to you.  Has the past year been worth it?  Are you
seeing in print what you wanted?  Do you like where Traveller has gone?
Bassically, Are you getting what you wanted?

I certainly hope not, because if you are getting what you wanted, then you
have set your expectations too low and you dream, the dream we all love,
Traveller, will die.

I have enjoyed most of the tme I have spent with your game, Mr. Miller.  It
has given me many hours of enjoyment.  I can no longer support the products
that bear your name, though.  IMO, they are a rape of Traveller\'s fans.

You don\'t have to answer to me, though.  You really don\'t have to answer to
any of us.  You should answer to your fans, but it isn\'t necessary.  You do,
however, have to answer to yourself.  And so I ask again...

Are you getting what you wanted for Traveller?

        Hmmm.... I have a couple *alternate* subsectors in Massilia, so far,
with *fixed* (for me) data. Maybe I should submit them to JTAS, along with
Library Data, and just pretend is year 20 info and the FS data is
outdated... <g>. Maybe the TML should flood JTAS with corrected subsectors.

<Raises hand> Three! I have one too. Not much there worth nicking yet. 
It\'s contents include a reworking of David P. Summer\'s character

I intend to get a few brief campaign summaries and a GCA definition

Vernor Vinge wrote a novel called "A Fire Upon the Deep", in which, the

Physical laws are increasingly accelerated in each zone with the Beyond

In the game, lethal damage can kill you instantly, or give you a bleeding
wound that will kill you if you don\'t get help soon.  Martial artists can
do lethal damage under certain circumstances, so you can kill someone
quickly in a brawl if you feel the need.

It is possible to bludgeon someone to death in CORPS, but it\'s messy and
takes a long time (just like real life!)

I meant: 

(e.g., after going for a while, an outside lab observer will notice that your
acceleration efforts are going into providing you with higher mass, not
higher v.  You will not notice this, and in fact, will think that the
relativistic shortening of the outside universe in the direction of travel

Small quibble:  As mass decreases, the *acceleration* increases, for a
constant-thrust rocket (which most rockets are, more or less). 

Rocket performance analysis does require calculus, in the Real World (tm). 
Newton\'s original expression for the force law was actually F = dp/dt --
"force is proportional to the rate of change of momentum with respect to
time."  Momentum in turn is mass times velocity (p = mv).  For fixed mass,
this reduces to F = m dv/dt -- and since dv/dt is acceleration, further
simplifies to F = ma. 

However, for a realistic rocket, with fuel comprising 80% or more of its
mass, and consumed over a relatively short interval, one must instead
solve simultaneous differential equations for fuel use, thrust, mass, and
so forth to get an accurate answer.  FF&S provides a simplified method for
doing this in its section on realistic rockets.

For Traveller spacecraft using HEPlaR or thrusters, though, the change in
overall vessel mass as fuel is burned is small enough that it\'s reasonable
to treat the mass (and hence the acceleration) as constant.  This is a
simplifying assumption of the same general class as the one in which
vessel volume rather than mass is used to determine acceleration
performance; it\'s inaccurate, but so much simpler that we use it anyway.

   That is certainly true for rockets, but it does not apply to
   Traveller manuever drives, which are magical and maintain a constant
   acceleration when hooked up to a magical Traveller power plant.

   Off-topic musings: 

   The magic of Trav manuever drives, jump drives, and two-dimensional
   starmaps is an inherant part of Trav, and has been with the game
   since its first incarnation.  The obviousness of this fact makes me
   wonder where many people on this list have gotten the impression that
   Trav is "hard" science fiction.  A few possibilities occur to me:

   1)  The detail which "Mercenary" and "Striker" lavish on military
   equipment gave an illusion of hard science.

   2)  The techno-babble introduced in many late DGP and TNE products
   gave the illusion that some Trav manuever drives obey physical
   conservation laws.

   and most of all:

   3)  The gritty realism of Traveller\'s historical canon makes the
   technical details of the game appear "hard" by association.

   Whatever the causes, I just felt the need to point out, in
   contradiction to what some have asserted on this list, that Traveller
   is not and never has been a "hard" science-fiction game.  And I
   personally have no problem with that.  I have spent too much time
   thinking about what would have to be done to change Trav into a
   harder game, and I cannot see how this can be done while preserving
   canon.  Since I feel that what makes Traveller good /is/ its canon, I
   have basically abbandoned all attempts at rationalizing its magic.

   Back to on-topic musings:

> Or are the numbers so huge that the change
> in F is negligable?  Wouldn\'t this require some sort of integral to
> calculate accurately?

   For chemical rockets, the change is not negligible.  In free space,
   the calculation requires the use of differential equations to solve,
   and you get this result:

   	v = S logn(1 + m/(M-m))

   where v is the rocket\'s change in velocity, S is the specific impulse
   of the rocket fuel (3000 Newton-seconds per kilogram for the best
   chemical fuels), m is the mass of the fuel used, and M is the initial
   mass of the fully loaded rocket with fuel.  Logn is my notation for
   the natural logarithm.  The result, v, is in meters per second.  In
   the jargon of the field, v is called "delta vee".

   So for a rocket with a mass made up of 90% fuel, its maximum speed
   would be

   	v = (3000 m/s) logn(1 + 0.9M/(M - 0.9M)) = 3000 m/s * logn(10)
   	  = 6900 m/s

   Not very impressive by Traveller standards.

> Don\'t you also need to consider proximity to large masses as they can
> accelerate or decelerate a ship passing by?

   This is true for small acclerations over short periods of time, but
   in Traveller, starships have the ability to perform large
   accelerations for /very/ long periods of time.  A /single/
   space-combat turn in Trav is 1000 seconds long, as long as the entire
   firing duration of a Saturn V rocket. The gravity fields of a typical
   solar system cannot compete in any meaningful way with these
   starships, and their effects can be ignored to first order. The
   original incarnation had rules for the effects of planetary gravities
   on starship manuever.  Back when I first started playing the game, it
   took me about 15 minutes to realize that these effects could safely
   be ignored, and I haven\'t noticed those rules in any later
   incarnations of the game. 8^)

You may not believe this, Joe, but I actually like that.  The 
Imperial Grand Survey would be a great name for a book about the 
first official Imperial survey.

Oh, definitely, I was just having fun in that whole message, as 
advertised in the first few lines.  I\'m surprised at the number of people 
who assumed I was saying what The Official Word was, despite my explicit 
statement to the contrary.  I put in a disclaimer, then just tossed off 
the first few things that came to mind as I was typing the message.  As 
a result, I\'ve gotten everything from, "Huh?" to "Yeah, but that doesn\'t 
make sense, here\'s a better answer [which is what I wanted/expected out 
of the message]" to "You moron! You\'re ruining Traveller! If you expect 
me to believe that crap, you\'re even stupider than I thought you were!" in 
response.  Quite enlightening. ;)

Sorry to hear about the page down sizing.  I would have liked to have 
seen that.  I\'ll probably buy that 101 book when you get it out--that 
is if I can get it for a reasonable price here in the US.

Thanks for the info,

You\'ve read the SOM correctly.  Since I posted that, I have been 
enlightened to other references in CT.  See my other post on that.

The point here is, I\'m implementing variable jump fuel requirements 
in my campaign too based on the simple formulas in CT.

T4 is based on CT, and it seems to fit.


> 	Also, what happens to the energy stored in the crystals after 2 or 3
> hours? It has to go somewhere...

The SOM says that if the energy is not released in 2-3 hours, the 
crystals will explosively decompose and do significant damage to the 
ship.

No where in the SOM does it state that all the jump fuel is used--it 
is only in the way things are written do you get a feel for that.  
Back that up with the articles in Traveller\'s Digest and the 
MegaTraveller Journal, and it is clear that all of the jump fuel is 
used no matter what the jump.

But, if you use the CT formula, like I am going to do, the info in 
the SOM is still relevant.  It\'s still a "copious quantity" of fuel 
being used even for a lower jump--it is just that copious quantity is 
less than the ship\'s total tankage of jump fuel.

At least, that\'s how I\'m going to start playing it.  When I first 
asked you about the jump fuel thing, I was curious because of what I 
had read in the magazines and the SOM.

Since, I have changed my view on the subject.  You and I agree 
now (I don\'t mean for it to sound like our friendly discussion was 
anything more than that).

The TML has done its job again.

Look everyone!  Closeure on the TML!

Hmmm.  You are right about Starter Traveller (I have that too).

Let\'s see--

In CT, Jump Fuel was variable:
          * Starter Traveller--Variable Fuel, page 32.
          * CT Book 2:  Starships--Variable Fuel, page 15.
          * Traveller Book--Variable Fuel, page 60.
          * CT Book 5:  High Guard--Variable Fuel, page 22.

In MT, Jump Fuel was Fixed:
          * SOM--Fixed Fuel, (not covered directly, but implied page 
             12.
           * DGP Staff/Traveller\'s Digest #20--Fixed Fuel (and also 
              states that CT had fixed fuel too, which is not the 
              case), page 38.
           * Marc Miller/DGP Staff/MegaTraveller Journal #4--Fixed 
             Fuel (but also lists a variant for variable fuel), page 
             88.
           * MT Core Rules (couldn\'t find a listing)
           

In TNE, Jump Fuel was Variable:
            * TNE Core Rules Book (couldn\'t find a listing)
            * Brilliant Lances--Variable Fuel, page 3 of Technical 
              Manual.

And now, in T4, Jump Fuel is again Variable:
            * T4 Book 1--Variable Fuel (implied), page 92.

Given all this, I am convinced that T4 jump fuel is supposed to be 
variable based on parsec jumped, although the info in T4 is sparse.

Since T4 is so closely linked with CT, it seems that this is the 
case.

I was going by the more definitive answers to these questions in the 
MT sources, but upon looking at the CT sources, it is as plain as 
day.

I guess what really swayed me was that Marc Miller himself has said 
that jump fuel is fixed (see the citation under MegaTraveller above). 
 Contrasting this is the rules in CT.  

When it comes down to it, I guess I don\'t really care which way 
it goes, but thanks for the tip in the right direction,

Kenneth.

I agree with this 100%.  I\'d be still upset that the mistake was made 
in the first place, but at least I could see IG trying to correct the 
error.  This would show me that IG is trying to put out quality 
product and wanting to avoid mistakes like this in the future.

Their current line of reasoning on this issue basically says, "We 
screwed up.  We know it, and we are not going to do anything about 
it."

So IG screwed up.  OK--its growing pains for a new company (still).  

Why not fix the screw up?

And, the bigger issue here is--not only are they not fixing screw up, 
but they are REPUBLISHING the screw up a second time.

That make absolutely no sense to me.  So, they screwed up once--a 
loging thing to do is fix the problem.

But, IG is not doing this.  They are re-publishing the same data in a 
hard back FS/M0 combination.

They are making matters worse, not better.

What was that old line--Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, 
shame on me?

Here\'s what IG should do.  It is pretty simple and logical to most 
people.

1)  Correct the data and other problems in FS/M0.

2) Provide this data free of charge via their web site (or even in 
the JTAS--which is acceptible), and have it available for anybody 
via snail mail if they send in a SASE.

3) Publish the new FS/M0 book with the corrected data.


Now, what would you rather buy?  A hard back version of FS/M0 with 
all of the problems fixed and the additional 32 pages (I might even 
buy that)?

Or, do you want a hard back version of FS/M0 with the same crappy 
problems as the first printing--but hey, you\'re getting 32 extra 
pages that explain why the data is not so screwed up.

Give me the first choice.

What the hell is IG thinking?

Sounds nice - I remember the article and use it - it\'s one of those in the

I suspect Imperial citizens would refer to the number of leagues, sorry

I\'m not sure if that would work, Dave.  In fact, I\'m not even sure if 
IG cares.

For a while, when I found a piece of errata in the IG products, I 
would forward a short message to IG at suggestions@imperiumgame.com.

I figured that I was doing my part by forwarding these things.  Silly 
me, I figured that IG would be interested in errors in their products 
and want to correct them in future printings.

Well, I got a message from IG saying that I shouldn\'t forward this 
stuff anymore, and if I had an actual game question, they gave me 
another e-mail address to forward it to.

So, given this, I\'m not really sure if IG really cares what we all 
think of their using obviously bad data in the new printing of FS/M0.

They are going to do it anyway, so why even try to make this game we 
love so much better than it is?

I would welcome just world name, Location and LL data.  Yes it\'s awkward,

Absolutely, again Name, Location, and LL.

When the Star Wars RPG was revised, all the changes were included in an
adventure journal (they were also free to those who requested it), a similar
policy from IG might help ease customer\'s concerns.

I can\'t believe how much I agree with Paul\'s post.  It touches on 
every emotion I\'ve had with regard to T4.

I wish I would have written it.

IG should listen to everything Paul is saying.  I\'ve been a Traveller 
player for 15 years now.  I\'m one of those fanatic, buy everything I 
can put my paws on kinda Traveller GM.  I spent $1500 buying up old, 
out of print Traveller stuff when I started my campaign a year and a 
half ago--before I knew about T4.

And even with all this passion I have for the game, I feel exactly 
like Paul does.  I\'m an abused wife too.

IG--please, please get your act together.  Show us some faith.  Give 
us something to believe in again.

getting so upset over a stupid game?  You must be laughing at 
us--taking this game so seriously.

But, I\'ll tell ya.  You should thank the stars that Traveller has 
such devoted fans.  We\'re the reason Traveller has not fallen by the 
way side like so many other RPGs.

What I\'m trying to tell you is--you\'d better start making better 
decisions with Traveller or you are going to alienate too many die 
hard players.  Look at Paul--selling off his stuff.

We want Traveller to succeed as much as you do.  Actually, we 
probably want it to do well more than you do--because this is our 
hobby, our passion.  We do this for fun.

IG, I hope you are listening.

Kenneth.

And now, I\'ll tell ya:

That\'s it everybody!  Let\'s do what Tim and JD are suggesting!

Let\'s just blindly buy IG products--no matter the quality. 

Let\'s buy two editions of everything they put out--the first busted 
version and the second busted version with an explanation why it is 
not really busted, if you look at it right.

Let\'s buy every product IG puts out--no matter if we can use it or 
not.

Let\'s not get angry that IG is re-publishing broken material.

Let\'s not get upset that IG\'s quality control sucks.

Let\'s not voice an opinon, scream, shout, or even set our hair on 
fire to get IG to notice what is wrong with the stuff they are 
putting out.

Let\'s play with a task system, done a second time, that continues to 
be broken--I mean hey, they fixed the original problems, right?  They 
can\'t help it if their fix also has problems of its own.

Let\'s just keep putting up with this shit.



Well, I\'ll tell ya Tim, and you too JD, the battle cry here is not to 
GROW UP.  It\'s to STAND UP!

Stand up for the game that captures your imagination and makes us so 
passionate about it.

Stand up and let IG know when they are making a bad decision.

Stand up and have an affect on the quality of the game that we are 
all pooring hundreds of dollars into.

STAND UP AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT WE EXPECT OUT OF THEM.



We are the customers, after all, and beyond that, we are not casual 
consumers.  We are all crazy about this game, and we take it 
personally when we feel we are being treated poorly.  Most of us buy 
everything with a Traveller logo on it--but look, from the recent 
posts, this is starting to changel.

This FS/M0 decision feels like betrayal.  Maybe IG will see all of 
these die hard fans taking so much offense to their decision that 
they will change it to make us happy.

Let\'s hope so.  

And guess what Tim and JD?  If IG does listen, you too will benefit 
from the rest of us standing up for what we believe in with regard to 
this game-- because the future products you buy will be much better 
than the crap we are seeing now.

Or, maybe, like your posts insinuated, you really don\'t care about 
Traveller being the premier SF game in existence, because in order 
for it to be that, we\'ve got to see better stuff from IG than what we 
are seeing.

Get off your butts.  STAND UP, and help make Traveller what all the 
other game companies talk about.

STAND UP.

The DMs in KBv2.0 weigh exactly the same as they do in T4--otherwise, 
KBv2.0 would not be a good fix.

I\'ve had this question before--maybe I should put something in the 
KBv2.0 rules about it.

Here\'s an example (when I refer to T4 below, I\'m refering to 
T4-Revised, but the example works with original T4 as well):

Sample character--         Jed  Attribute 7, Skill 3

Under T4-Revised:  Target number is 10
Under KBv2.0:  Target number is 16

Under T4-Revised:  Difficult throw is a 2.5D proposition
Under KBv2.0:  Difficult throw is a 4D proposition

Under T4-Revised:  Chance of success is 71.3%
Under KBv2.0:  Chance of success is 76%

As you can see, the % chance of success is about the same, but 
because of the way KBv2.0 calculates target numbers, a character\'s 
skill has more impact on that % being what it is.

 Now, if we add a +1 DM to the mix--

Under T4-Revised:  Target number becomes 11
Under KBv2.0:  Target number becomes 17

Under T4-Revised:  Chance of success is increased to 82.4%
Under KBv2.0:  Chance of success is increased to 84.1%

So, you see, DMs in KBv2.0 are weighted about the same as they are in 
T4.  Therefore, when using KBv2.0, you should use DMs just like you 
do if you were using T4 as is.

I purposely designed KBv2.0 to allow for this.  I put a lot of work 
into the system, and I think I\'ve covered every eventuality--this is 
why I promote it so hard, and this is why the people who really 
understand it like it as much as they do. 

 It seems
> to me as if the effects of these DMs falls off drastically as the

> (percentage wise) in the target number.

This is true in T4 and T4-Revised as well because of the multiple 
dice used.  KBv2.0 will give you about the same increase per DM as 
these other official systems--as I detailed above.

My answer is--use DMs with no modification in KBv2.0.  The proof of 
the impact being the same is in the above example.


> 	2) Experience - If I read your system right, characters advance by
> skill levels, rather than experience levels. This gives a rather coarse
> experience curve - by jumps of three.

Basically, KBv2.0 says that 1 skill level is worth 3 points in an 
attribute.  Let\'s test that.

The average attribute is 7.  The average skill level is 2.   Under 
KBv2.0, a character\'s experience score for this skill would be 6.

And, 6 is about equal to 7.

And assumption is made in KBv2.0 that, although there is no skill 
level maximum, skill levels will begin leveling off between 5 and 6.  
A level 7 skill should be incredibley rare.  This is the way skills 
were weighted in CT and MT.  TNE skills were weighted about double 
that of CT/MT.  Since T4 is based on CT, I chose to weight skills 
appropriately.

Now, if you use the T4 chargen system, you might get a character with 
some outrageous skill level--like level 9 or so.  This is a problem 
with the T4 chargen system, and Marc Miller has written to me in a 
private post that he intends to fix this in T4-Revised.

I expect skills in T4-Revised to be weighted about the same as in 
CT, except characters will have more skills in total than they did 
before.

Right now, to combat this, you might want to impose some sort of 
throw for chargen per year to decrease the skill level awards in that 
system until T4-Revised comes out.

I, and some other TMLers, are working on an experience system for 
KBv2.0, and our plan, so far, is to implement an idea similiar to 
what you have proposed.

The idea is that a character\'s experience score will go up one point 
when he improves.  On the third such increase, the character will be 
raised one level.  In doing this, you will have the smooth curve that 
you are talking about.

I\'m waiting to see what the T4-Revised experience system will be 
like.  The one in the original T4 book is certainly broken,and I want 
to see what IG will do with it.

I don\'t want to put a lot of work into a system only to find a good 
one in the T4-Revised rules.  And, even if the T4-Revised xp system 
is broken, I want my KBv2.0 fix to be as much like it as possible.

I design rules that fit seemlessly into the original game mechanics.  
I\'m not trying to reinvent the wheel--I just want logical fixes to 
problems in the official rules.  I\'m not trying to design my own 
system.

In order to do that, I have to wait to see what the official rule is 
going to be.  After T4-Revised comes out, I\'ll decide on what 
experience system works best with KBv2.0.

If you have any more questions regarding KBv2.0, Ryan, I\'ll be glad 
to answer them.

Again, I\'m glad you like KBv2.0.

   The subject of relativistic motion by Traveller starships came up
   recently.  I had posted some information on it, but I also begged off
   posting complete equations because I had difficulty deriving them.

   Well, I have succeeded, so here they are.

   Conventions:

   All distances in meters, times in seconds, acceleration in meters per
   second squared (where 1G = 10 m/s^2, 2G = 20 m/s^2, and so on). All
   equations assume that the ship starts from rest at the origin,
   accelerates to midpoint and then decellerates to rest at the
   destination.

   D = distance in meters
   A = acceleration in m/s^2
   t = dialated time as experienced by the starship\'s crew
   T = undialated time as experienced by the planetary populations
   c = speed of light: 300,000,000 meters per second

   D = (1/4) * A * t^2
   t = sqrt(4*D/A)

   D = (c^2/A) * (  sqrt(4+(A*T/c)^2) - 2  )
   T = (c/A) * sqrt( (A*D/c^2)*(A*D/c^2 + 4) )

   I hope these help out you high velocity buffs out there.

   Here is a table I made for trips with transit times of less than 10
   years (dialated).  Here (in the table) D is measured in light years
   (3.2 ly to a hex), A is measured in G\'s, and the times are in years.

One thing to note - the creation of FS, I suspect, involved very little
data grooming.  I suspect Marc has a spreadsheet that was to reduce the
UPPs from later eras to those of M0, and that he tested it a bit, but did
not notice the bug that made LAW=GOV.  Further, from what was said before,
the books were never shown to outside people before being shipped, and only
lightly looked at in house, so all responsibility for individual books
rested with the authors and the typesetter, while there was nobody with the
job of consistency analysis.  It shows, and hopefully, the new management
will not make quite as many mistakes.  We shall see.

From what Joe said, the M0 authors were told that the subsector map in the
basic book would be canon, but then had the FS map implanted after
publication.  He likely had not read the galleys of M0 that included the
places of interest before he did FS, and so did not take any care to make
M0 in any way consistent with the FS data - he could not have.  (I would
refuse to do a FS under those conditions, but I am not privy to IG
finances, or the contracts he signed.  He might not have had a choice, or
he might not have been able to force the authors to work in concert with him.)

I do not have a facile argument for why Vland, etc., was not carefully
checked, and I still find the whole thing nigh unforgivable, but at least
it is understandable, and a result of lousy process.  At the time this was
done, Marc was not shown works in progress until they were too late to
change.  Not a great way to run a railroad, and it produced an unbelievable
amount of ill will, but at least it makes a kind of sense.  Hopefully, they
have learned that you cannot do this and expect your customers to take you
seriously.  They claim to have, and to have fixed the process.

I Tried. I really TRIED with T4. I\'m not so much a systems man, though I
liked the TNE sys. I scoured my old Traveller Collection. I independantly
discovered most of the wonderful background that CORE fitted into M0. Then
the Crap Maps and Crap Stats spewed forth from FS. I Knew that if I 
was to run M0 I\'d have to put a lot more effort than it was worth into it - 
all because of the crappy FS data. I could have screamed - and I did.
Sad thing was that I was running a successful M0 game at my local club.

Good point, but I said *major* race.  Then again it might have been a
GDW design decision and no reasoning can be attached to it at this point
in time.

Actually no there is not.  Reverse engineering something is different from

I think the solomani discovered it, thats why they went so quickly from
J-1 drives to J-3.  Also, the Solomani alien module does not say anything
about ancient sites on the moons of Jupiter(that i can find anyway) - your
thinking of 2010.

Dont have the module so cant say - but a few hundred years is a pretty
long time, I am sure Grandfather did not help them.

Or rather, using less emotionally loaded terms, Traveller propusion
systems use a small enough fraction of the total craft\'s mass that, as a
simplifying assumption, this change of mass is neglected in calculating
accelerations.  As I noted in an earlier post, FF&S provides both the full
realistic analysis and a simplified method for applying it as "alternate
technology," for anyone interested in the nitty gritty details.  However,
as spacecraft in Traveller are plot devices rather than NASA design
studies, I find it more than sufficient that they are (a) reasonably
credible, and (b) well-defined in performance and characteristics.

Two-dimensional starmaps are admittedly silly, but again, are
plot/simplicity driven, and needn\'t be construed as reducing the
\'hardness\' of Traveller\'s SF.  What players want to know is how far apart
(say) Regina and Rhylanor are, and what they\'ll find in between.  A
three-dimensional map could answer the same question more \'realistically\',
but would also (with today\'s technology) be incredibly hard to use.

Traveller maneuver drives aren\'t all that magical, either.  HEPlaR barely
strains my credulity -- I mean, yes, it\'s mind-bogglingly efficient, but
fusing hydrogen and spouting it out the stern is pretty straightforward
extrapolation.  Thrusters without any modifications from canon violate
energy conservation, but for game purposes I\'m willing to handwave in an
explanation for them...and note that a lot of SF widely accepted as \'hard\'
(e.g., Niven\'s Known Space, Clarke\'s Rama sequence) feature reactionless
drives.

Jump drive is, frankly, pure magic...but do you reject any SF featuring
FTL as \'soft\'?

Actually, a lot of their technobabble annoyed me, as they blew a thing or
two pretty badly, IMHO.  But I didn\'t mind seeing them make the effort.  I
don\'t recall any of these products claiming to have solved the
conservation problems, however.

The canon history is as swiss-cheese-like as the canon technology.  STL
expeditions from Terra winding up just short of the Marches?  Idyllic
garden worlds with 80 inhabitants, one parsec away from horrid dirtballs
with corrosive atmospheres -- and the latter allegedly settled thousands
of years ago by refugees from dozens of parsecs away?  A Zhodani
deep-cover espionage effort naming -- in Imperial records! -- an Imperial
planet\'s ocean in the Zhodani language?  800 dton vessels being described
as "battlecruisers"?  Vilani living and working within a few parsecs of
Terra for many centuries without ever hopping into Sol system and
contacting us?  And those are all from CT -- I won\'t even start on the
fish-in-a-barrel exercise that is M0.

I know of damn few harder ones, and only one involving interstellar travel --
2300 AD.

Which simplifies to:

        v = S ln(M/(M-m))

which is equivalent to the form someone else posted.

S is not the specific impulse, but rather the exhaust velocity.  Isp is
measured in seconds; a "Newton-second per kilogram" reduces to "meters per
second."  (Newton = kg m/s2, * s = kg m/s, / kg = m/s)

Yeah, but what do you expect for 3 km/s exhaust speeds?  Give the exhaust
a velocity of 0.001 c (= 3e5 m/s) and the delta-v rises to 6.9e5 m/s, or a
respectable 700 km/s = 2.5 million km/hr, or about 40 BL/BR hexes per
half-hour turn...right in the ballpark of actual Traveller ship
performance.

Yeah, I used to run LBB space combats near black holes and neutron stars,
just so there\'d be something pulling powerfully enough to make Trav ships
notice it existed. :)

I believe the original complaint was about your never missing a chance to
complain about IG not buying KBv2.0. You did some good work, many people
have congratulated you on it, many people are using your system.  IG,
however passed.  End of story.

Rather than moan to the list about IG, I have informed them in email that I
will not buy their products without closely examining them first.  I have
informed them that they can no longer count on a number of long-time
Traveller players, people who formally reached for their wallets in a
Pavalovian response to new Traveller, simply because of their inexcusable
lack of quality.

Complaining to the list is becoming an excercise in preaching to the choir.
 You need to reach IG directly, and inform them directly of what is making
you upset.  No diss to Joe, but one guy saying "the TML is upset" doesn\'t
have nearly the impact of several dozen polite messages, clearly stating
the problems you have with the current policies.

provided by a custom-designed X-tek Fusion plant, and is fueled for one

are accurate out to 10 LS, passive sensors to 5.  This allows early
detection of any threat, to allow the maximum decision time for the
Captain.  Communications are routed through either a .3 Mw maser array, or
broadcast by the 1 Mw radio system.  Defensive EMS systems include a
standard EMS jammer (120k km radius) and a strong area jammer (90k km radius.)

Vernor Vinge, an SF author who isn\'t *nearly* as well recognized as he
should be. The specific reference is to a book of his titled "A Fire
Upon the Deep", which has a rather neat concept about the way spacetime
is put together...

Min pop should be the minimum *viable* population. Which at low tech
levels can be as small as a few hundred.

With low specific impulse (Isp) rockets, you do have to worry about
this. But with the High Isp rockets in Traveller it\'s not much of a
concern. 

Isp = thrust /(mass flow of fuel)
Isp = Exhaust velocity / g = Ve/9.8

The way rockets work, you get the change in velocity from the change in
*mass* and a bit of math.

delta V = Ve*ln(starting mass/ending mass)

It doesn\'t matter *what* rate you burn the fuel at. Just that you do so.

I tend to believe Vinge\'s concept of the Singularity. There will come a
point when everything that we can *imagine* that is allowable by the
universe can be done. And it\'s likelt to be less than 100 years from
now. So anything after that point is *literally* unimaginable.

An example from *recent* history of an idea that no one *imagined* is
video games and the consequent development of virtual reality. We
imagined TV and "supercomputers", but never thought to put them
together that way before it was already happening in reality.

Here\'s a relevant quote:

"I went to my first computer conference at the New York Hilton about 20
 years ago.  When somebody there predicted the market for microprocessors
 would eventually be in the millions, someone else said, "Where are they
 all going to go? It\'s not like you need a computer in every doorknob!"

 Years later, I went back to the same hotel.  I noticed the room keys had
 been replaced by electronic cards you slide into slots in the doors.

 There was a computer in every doorknob."

The only places they "collide" are areas where we haven\'t been able to

Sorry, but the Greeks figured out that the Earth was round 2500-3000
years ago. Any educated person in Europe or the near east knew this a
thousand years ago. (Side note: the big problem with Columbus was that
he thought the world was *smaller*, both he and his critics agreed that
it was round. BTW, Columbus *was* wrong!)

And this is where people get confused. To a first approximation, the
earth is a sphere. If you need more accurtacy, you dicover that there\'s
an equatorial bulge due to spin. This is a correction of *feet* out of
a total distance of thousands of miles. Satellites came up with a
*third* correction, which has more mass south of the equator than north
of it. This is a fix of *inches*.

All the rules go this way. When a subject first becomes a science, it
gets an *accurate* approximation of reality. As study continues, you
get better and better idea of what the rules are. But that "first cut"
answer is still there, but with corrective factors added. 

So, for example, according to Newton, gravity is proportional to mass.
Einstein showed that energy, momentum, and angular momentum also
"stress" space in a manner that produces gravity. It just takes a *lot*
more.

I agree! I just tried to purchase it in an auction, but when the

Now if it were rereleased, the prices would surely drop, as it

You\'re quite right. The Megatraveller jump governor is a completely
different dingus than the CT jump governor. The Megatraveller version is
merely a bit of local color. The CT jump governor has a function:

"JUMP GOVERNOR: It is possible to procure a jump governor for ships
produced according to Book 2. It allows such a ship to utilize fuel more
efficiently; instead of consuming all fuel when performing a jump, 
regardless of jump number, the ship will consume fuel equal to 0.1MJn,
where Jn is the actual jump number used, rather than the maximum jump
number available. Available at any industrial world with tech level 10
or higher. Cost: Cr300 000. Mass: 1 ton. Ships produced according to
this book already have the jump governor as part of their drives."
[High Guard, p. 32].
 
>I think I\'m just going to keep it the standard way.  The reasoning in 
>the SOM makes sense to me.

The "reasoning" in the SOM is just as much doubletalk as the "reasoning" 
in CT (Less, actually, since CT dosen\'t attempt to explain the workings
of the jump drive at all, rather than the flawed explanation of Mega-
traveller). The salient point is wether it makes sense in context. Since
Megatraveller jump drives use different fuel consumptions than CT drives
then it may make sense to change the other rule too. But I will advice
you to consider the matter carefully, since the absences or presence of
jump governors will affect grand strategy profoundly, especially prior
to the invention of drop tanks in the late 10th Century.

If warships can\'t jump short and retain some fuel, I\'d expect to see a
lot of designs with auxilliary jump-1 drives.

Personally I\'d think that with T4 being a return to CT, the jump governor
should be considered back in business again, at least until we learn
differently from official side.

IIRC, they have some fairly sophistocated technology even at TL 1, which I
suspect would require more than a few hundred people.  Since I do not have
my books handy to check that, I am willing to recant if presented with
proper canon :)

More seriously, I read a study on weaponry that indicated that general
gunmaking required a population of at least in the hundreds of thousands
top provide the aniclliary technology of metal refining, extracting
resources over the wide area usually associated with hot springs and cave
walls, and so on.  It was assuming the "perfect" distribution of 1700-1800
technology as well.

I will see if I can rustle that up again.

Before IG came along, when I was desperately seeking a mint copy of 
Azhanti High Lightning for under $200, I was thinking along the same 
lines as you are, above.  I thought, "If GDW re-released Azhanti for $80 
a copy, they could clean up - no development costs, just add a note about 
the printing edition to the copyright page, and send it to the 
printers.  Sell it over the \'net if no distributers are interested."

I still lack a copy of Adventure 12 (Secret of the Ancients) and a copy 
of Atlas of the Imperium.  But, I\'ve pretty much given up on finding 
them.

Whenever IG releases Milieu 1100, I agree that a lot of that stuff should 
be re-released.  Bundle the Adventures and Double Adventures into a few 
volumes.  Reprint the Spinward Marches Campaign and The Traveller 
Adventure.  All updated for the current rules, of course.

Anyway...

Actually, I\'m working with one of those right now.. Tenalphi/Lunion (1826)

I\'m glad somebody got the reference.  This was deliberate, done to scare
one of my players who is utterly paranoid, and reads subtext into
everything.  When they boarded the Pride of Cucamonga, he read the name on
the drive housing and started moaning about missjumps and my well-known
penchant for genre mixing.

This was a Good Thing.

BTW, Do we have a list of all the companies that we\'ve created for the
ISBA/THUDD?  Not just the shipyards, but all the subcontractors.

A near-c cookie for anyone, other than Craig, who can guess where I\'m
getting these names from...

I sent my money order in a few weeks back.  Ghod help them if I get a book
as pathetic as I\'m fearing.  Since I\'m now using CORPS, it probably won\'t
come to violence, but a one-man embargo is a real possibility.

These two I can honestly recommend.  Both are by Greg Porter who is one of
the better designers out there, and both are generally useful for any
Traveller setting.

Well, I\'m currently writing up the Lunion subsector for the classic era.
This will be a detailed, complete exploration of all 30-odd worlds, their
systems, cultures, etc.  I\'ll be putting it on the web, and making it
avalible for downloads in Word 6.0.  (Once I\'m done, if anyone wishes to
convert it to a Mac format, feel free to contact me.)

I\'m waiting to see what happens with the Big Book O\' Aliens we\'ve been
promised.  I would like to see these covered as well, though I have both
Digest Group alien books, so I\'m pretty well covered there.

This is a very good idea.  How about it CORE?  We take, say, the first 12
THUDD winners, do deckplans and illustrations, and sell the puppy.
Speaking for myself, I\'d contribute any designs of mine that make the cut
(vote for the Terrapin, vote for the Terrapin) for the knowledge that I\'ve
helped produce a quality product and promise from some of the BITSers that
if I ever get to the ancesteral isle, I\'d have crash space and local guides.

Hell, include a section on design tricks, write-ups for some of our
corporations.. I\'d buy this!

Sorry, but not a chance.  Steve Jackson evidently asked about this, and was
turned down.  (Loren, is that correct?  This is something I heard from a
SJG staffer at a con.)  Anyway, SJG is shying away from licensed products
for GURPS, focussing on home-brewed settings and generic supplements.
Traditionally, the licensed worldbooks do very poorly.

Put that one on my wish list too!  Traveller has always meant trade to me,
it\'s one of the few games I know where being a merchant can *be* the
adventure, not just backround material.

	Joe, do you want updated (Excel95) copies in ZIP format to post as well?
I\'m not finding any time at all to keep my site up-to-date, although I hope
that changes in a month or two.

	BTW, Excel uses ".xlm" for macro sheets, I believe.

	Because we care. And if enough people let IG AND Marc (farfuture@aol.com)
know what a cockup this is, maybe they\'ll listen. A short concise summary
of our complaints and suggested fixes, plus 35K of original messages, might
wake the clue-bird.

When I saw TBP, conscient that I was going to expend more money in gaming
material than my actual economy allowed, I thought that was what I expected
from a game system.=20

T4 was a deception to me too. I didn\'t like the half dices, not the
more-than-two-dice rolls (Am I old fashioned?), not the constant errors of
the many supplements that followed (with little exceptions, like Milieu 0),
not to speak of the price (in Spain, with the dollar crowning the peak of
our nightmares, a T4 supplement is really, really expensive=8A) =20

So well, they =B3screw=B2 me too, as a matter of fact; but served to see th=

Traveller material, those things that signed an era in sf gaming that has

playing with a capital group of players in Barcelona which formed a real
core of Traveller afficionados =ADwith the added struggle of going through=
 a
lot of efforts to get the material from the states=AD) but I been silent
because I thought that those opinions were only mine; what I readed in TML

Do you happen to have the relativistic form of the
v=at equation handy?  (I\'ve been meaning to work it
out and it would save me some time.)

Also, I take it you are assuming that accel. reamains
constant as the ship takes on relativistic mass (instead
of the force of thrust?)

    'from' => 'Glenn Grant',
    'body' => 'To Paul, Ken, and other Recovering Victims of IG:

I\'m confused.

I\'ve been lurking through the latest round of complaints about IG, and
here\'s what I hear:

Yep, we are all appalled by most of the T4 books produced thus far, with
the general exception of CSC, M:0, and EA. The books suffer from poor
editing, ambiguous prose, a vast number of typos, inconsistent rules and
data, lack of playtesting, terrible layout, awful B&W illustrations,
unspeakably hideous deckplans (or none at all!), unpopular choice of color
illustrations and so on. Incredibly, Mark Miller, the guy whose name
appears on the covers, seems to have been left out of the loop during the
production of the first several books. And they\'re all too expensive. We\'ve
called on IG to fix their numerous errors.

Now I understand that recently IG have moved the offending personnel to
other positions, and hired new editors and new writers, including Mark
Miller himself, a new layout designer, new illustrators, and (presumably)
playtesters; they\'ve delayed books to ensure they are properly edited and
tested, rather than rushing inferior products to the market. They\'ve even
dropped their prices - albeit not as much as we would like, but they\'re
obviously trying. And in response to our calls for error-correction,
they\'re completely re-writing Book 1, and reworking other books - with
newly added material so that, even though you have to buy the book again,
you\'re at least getting something extra with the new edition.

But do they get any credit for any of this? We should be shouting, "This is
good! This is what we want! This is what we asked for! Sure, we\'d have
liked it to be done right the FIRST time, but it\'s nice to see them
learning from their mistakes." But no. Instead of this, I\'m hearing more
complaints!

Folks, why are you complaining that IG is reworking the books you
complained about?! First you holler for the books to be corrected. Then,
when IG prepare new books which will correct most of the problems of the
screwy ones, you complain that the value of what you\'ve bought thus far is
being reduced! I think the IG folks are obviously concerned about this
issue. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY WANT TO KEEP THE SYSTEM DATA FROM FS? Why
don\'t they just do a second edition with new data? Answer: So that people
who already own the book won\'t feel they\'ve shelled out for something
that\'s already obsolete - obviously! Duh.

Something else you guys have completely ignored: yes, Joe Walsh said that
the Law Levels will be left as they are, but he also said that the new
version of FS will include a* Law Level UWP extension* - which I take to
mean that the error *is* being fixed - but fixed in a way that doesn\'t
completely invalidate the books many fans have already bought. Is their
concern for this issue appreciated? Apparently not.

Sure, it\'s a kludge. Sure, it would\'ve been easier on everyone if FS had
not been edited by incompetents. But in terms of damage control, I think
what IG is doing is not unreasonable. Joe\'s explanation of the Law Level
bug (the idea that, during the First Survey, Law Level had not yet been
introduced to the UWP) is not completely senseless. Why should everything
in M:0 be exactly the same as during the Fifth Frontier War?

Yes, the Gov=LL bug was an unbelievable screw-up and the book should never
have been sent to press, let alone sent out to the stores, with such an
obvious error. But now that it\'s too late, why are you dumping all over IG
for trying to come up with a solution that doesn\'t make things worse? Sure,
you\'d like them to replace your books for free? Obviously they would if
they could. But I rather wonder if that\'s economically feasible. Sounds to
me like a quick route to bankruptcy. (And don\'t tell me what the Star Wars
publishers would do in this situation! This is irrelevant! IG don\'t have
Lucasfilm behind them!)

Ken: so they\'re going to have a half-die in the task system. Have you ever
considered that just maybe it\'s because Mark balks at asking players to
throw SEVEN DICE for every Impossible Task?! I think this may have a little
something to do with it. (If I were him, I\'d choose KBv2.0, but I\'m not
him.) Even if he did eliminate that half-die from the Task System, there
are still a number of weapons that do half-die of damage - so it\'s still
not gone from the game!

Paul: being ripped off by a publisher is not analogous to being raped. Cool it.

Can we maybe tone down the angst a bit, at least until the new books
appear? Can we at least wait and see what these new books really look like
before we start shooting them full of buckshot? Voice any concerns you
have, certainly. Argue for changes before it\'s too late - good. But let\'s
not slag IG for trying to *do what we\'ve asked them to do.*

Peeved,

I\'ll second this approach.  I had my doubts before, but this latest 
First Survey debacle was the last straw.  I canceled my T4 hardback 
order and told them why - I could no longer afford to buy products 
from them sight unseen, especially when I know in advance that the
task system in the rulebook will have problems.  I also informed them 
that I could no longer recommend T4 to anyone looking for a SF game 
due to the substandard products and poor customer service.

Maybe if enough people do this, IG will get a clue and wake up.
Vote with your wallets/purses/credit cards!, and let IG know about it!

This is a must have for any Traveller ref interested in creating realistic

at different stages of solar system development, and any number of
adventure hooks.

I got my copy for about $15.00, so it\'s cheaper than an IG book and more
useful to Traveller players too!

Sorry.

Anyway, this book will make my Lunion work far more intersting...

You\'re quite right. The Megatraveller jump governor is a completely
different dingus than the CT jump governor. The Megatraveller version is
merely a bit of local color. The CT jump governor has a function:

"JUMP GOVERNOR: It is possible to procure a jump governor for ships
produced according to Book 2. It allows such a ship to utilize fuel more
efficiently; instead of consuming all fuel when performing a jump, 
regardless of jump number, the ship will consume fuel equal to 0.1MJn,
where Jn is the actual jump number used, rather than the maximum jump
number available. Available at any industrial world with tech level 10
or higher. Cost: Cr300 000. Mass: 1 ton. Ships produced according to
this book already have the jump governor as part of their drives."
[High Guard, p. 32].
 
>I think I\'m just going to keep it the standard way.  The reasoning in 
>the SOM makes sense to me.

The "reasoning" in the SOM is just as much doubletalk as the "reasoning" 
in CT (Less, actually, since CT dosen\'t attempt to explain the workings
of the jump drive at all, rather than the flawed explanation of Mega-
traveller). The salient point is wether it makes sense in context. Since
Megatraveller jump drives use different fuel consumptions than CT drives
then it may make sense to change the other rule too. But I will advice
you to consider the matter carefully, since the absences or presence of
jump governors will affect grand strategy profoundly, especially prior
to the invention of drop tanks in the late 10th Century.

If warships can\'t jump short and retain some fuel, I\'d expect to see a
lot of designs with auxilliary jump-1 drives.

Personally I\'d think that with T4 being a return to CT, the jump governor
should be considered back in business again, at least until we learn
differently from official side.

Mr. Sinclair, yer a genius. This is so cool and elegant it just became fact

I never tried to sell KBv2.0 to IG.  I was going to give it to them.

The reason that I still bitch about the T4 revised task system is 
that it still has problems.  This burns me up because IG is taking a 
second wack at it and still screwing up.

There are problems with the T4-Revised task system.  IG doesn\'t have 
to use KBv2.0--I\'d be happy if they used another task system that 
wasn\'t broken.

KBv2.0 fixes the problems that I am talking about.  I\'m not saying it 
is the only fix--it is just the only one I\'ve seen that both 
continues the game mechanics in T4 and fixes the problems.

Basically, it is not that I want them to use KBv2.0 so bad--it\'s that 
I want them to use a task system that is not broken.

I guess I\'ll keep bitching about that.  Wait until my review comes 
out for T4-Revised.

I picked up a copy at a local thriftshop last week for $3.  The
Lightning Class Cruiser supplement was missing & the counters were
punched (but intact) but it was otherwise near mint, the deck plans were
all mint & it even still had the dice & the reply card.

No it is _not_ for sale.

This one is a little harder to find but I saw a (worn) copy go for about
$12 a week or so ago.

Don\'t give up.

You can find these items for sale in rec.games.frp.marketplace.

Just subscribe & read any posts that say Traveller or misc games & you
can find some real bargains.  I just picked up a copy of The Traveller
Adventure for $1 (torn cover otherwise near mint). I have also picked up
good condition copies of Solomani & Aslan, Vilani & Vargr & Starship
Operators Manual for $8 to $10 in the past three months.  If you cannot
access this newsgroup it will be harder I admit & for those of you
outside the USA the postage may be expensive.  If you do not want to pay
the auction price for a Traveller item don\'t, unless it is really rare
you will probably be able to find another one cheaper later.  A third of
the auctions do not have anyone who really cares that much about
Traveller bidding in them. 

Peter Newman - who probably should not have given away his sources.

P.S. I would also like to see these GDW stuff rereleased but GDW
Traveller stuff is not that hard to find.

I am normally opposed to me too posts but  "Me, too !" 

It is $16.99 retail.  This book has many, many neat features for a
planet building junkie such as myself.  The book is mostly text but has
lots of usefull formulas & data as well.

First off, Glenn, I\'d like to congradulate you on a fine post.  It 
was well thought out and written, and even though I may not agree 
with you, your point is concise and clear.

Yes.  They received a glowing review from me.  I liked both the EA 
and the CSC--and I thought the M0 book was OK.

I wrote great things about all of these products, and I\'ve supported 
and praised IG for the work that was done on these.

But, I guess my point has been this--

I was just starting to feel better about IG again.  There were some 
growing pains in the beginning, like what you cited in the snipped 
section.  I perservered on.

As you describe above, I saw improvement on the horizon.  As I 
said, the EA is one of the best Traveller products ever produced for 
any product.

Then, just as my faith is being restored and I feel Traveller is 
finally in good hands, I\'m hit, again, with a decision that is not 
only ludicrous, but completely idiotic.

It seems that as soon as IG does something that makes you feel good 
about them, they follow it up with something that makes you wonder 
how the hell whoever is in charge got that position.

Follow me here.  T4 main book--OK job, but disappointing in several 
areas.  Starships--completely disappointing.  Central Supply 
Catalog--Finally, a good product.  Aliens Archive--another blah, OK 
product.  Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society #25--disappointing, 
but OK product.  Milieu 0--OK product with problems.  First 
Survey--what a joke.  Referee\'s Screen--OK, but they could have done 
better.  And, finally, the Emperor\'s Arsenal--a fabulous work.

Do you see the pattern here?  Disappointing product--awful 
product--pretty good product--mediocre product--disappointing 
product--fair product--incredilbly bad product--disappointing 
product--great product.

Followed by news of the worst T4 product ever produced being 
re-published in an un-fixed format.

 I submit to you that the angst you are seeing is not overblown.  It 
is the result of Traveller lovers tired of buying T4 products that 
are bug ridden and otherwise just OK.

We want so much for Traveller, yet, we\'ve been let down over and 
over.

This is not overblown angst.  What you are seeing is people 
becoming fed up.  I\'ve bought disappointing products before, but 
never in this quantity.

We got our hopes up on seeing the EA--hoping that we had seen the 
last of the big screw ups.  Then we hear of another big screw up 
coming down the pipe.

That\'s frustrating as hell--especially when your hopes and 
expectations are so high for something.

No, you are not seeing overblown angst.  You\'re seeing people 
starting to get angry--because they are tired of being let down.

At least, that\'s the way I feel.  And, I know that I\'m not alone from 
all the posts I\'ve read.

 We should be shouting, "This is
> good! This is what we want! This is what we asked for! Sure, we\'d have

Wrong.  I posted my ass off about the EA.  Go back and check the 
archives.  Everybody knew how much I liked it.

But, most have found no value in FS.  I don\'t even crack it.  Keeping 
it the same--the same screwed up data--only keeps the book valueless.

What I\'m so angry about is that they are not correcting this stuff.  
What they should do is:

       1)  Correct the data in the book.
       2)  Make erratta sheets or make the info available on the web 
            site.  I\'d even be happy with the stuff being in JTAS.
       3)  Publish the hardback M0/FS with correct data.

Any other course of action does not correct the mistake they\'ve made.

This is not a fix.  New LL and Gov codes would be a fix.  This is a 
lazy way of republishing the same broken crap.

It is clear, to many, this is unacceptible.

I think that it is crap.

Actually, I know that they would never do this.  It\'s buyer beware.  
But the above fixes would suit me.

I\'d even buy a few issues of the JTAS to get the correct data.

Do you really believe that rolling seven dice is that much different 
from rolling five?

 I think this may have a little
> something to do with it. (If I were him, I\'d choose KBv2.0, but I\'m not

Thanks.  But let me make something absolutely clear.  

I\'m not angry about them not using KBv2.0.  I\'d be happy if they used 
any unbroken task system.  KBv2.0 just happens to be the best 
solution to the problem that I\'ve seen.

IG--I\'LL BE HAPPY WITH ANY TASK SYSTEM USED IN T4 AS LONG AS IT IS 
NOT BROKEN.

The half die is a matter of taste.  Most people don\'t like it--I know 
that from polling the list in between KBv1.1 (which used half dies) 
and KBv2.0.

But, what about the other problems with the T4-Revised task system?

Are you telling me that you are OK with a spectacular success rule 
that actually INCREASES your chance of rolling SS the harder the task 
you attempt?

Or, how about the fact that in T4-Revised, spectacular failure rolls 
cannot be done on Average and Difficult tasks?  

That\'s right--your character has to attempt a Formidable throw before 
he even has a chance to roll SF.

Are you sure that you are OK with that?

I feel like people are ignoring this.  But, after the task system is 
published in T4-Revised, people will notice.  Then, there will be 
another gripe session about how IG screwed it up again--on their 
second try.

I\'m telling you there is a way to fix all these problems.  I hope 
that IG listens before the new book comes out.

Don\'t use KBv2.0--I don\'t really care about that.  All I\'ve been 
saying is to come up with a system that is not broken.

> Paul: being ripped off by a publisher is not analogous to being raped. Cool it.

Actually, Paul\'s point said exactly how I feel.  He didn\'t mean, as 
he stated, that his feeling of being raped was like the horrible 
crime it is.

He meant that he feels betrayed--and he\'s angry about what he\'s 
seen done with Traveller.

I feel the same.

I never asked them to do this.  In fact, you\'ve seen my posts.  I\'m 
campaigning against the idiotic decision that IG seems set to do.

I\'ll tell ya.  The LL=GG is crap.  If they\'d replace the data with 
good, I\'d probably buy the new hard cover.  If they stay on this 
course, I won\'t.

Sorry I made you peeved.  I guess it is a side effect of IG makeing 
me pissed.

  {
    'body' => 'OK, it looks like all this negativity is getting to some 
people--including myself.

Let\'s start a new thread--a thread designed to show IG exactly what 
we have liked in Traveller products in the past.

Pick anything you like about Traveller, from any edition, from any 
company--rules, complete supplements, art, deck plans, history, 
whatever--and state what you like about it and why.

You can talk about a complete work, or just a small part of 
one.  Anything goes.  Name what you like about Traveller.

The idea here is to show IG the Traveller products that we really 
value.  Give them a pattern to follow.  Let\'s show them 
the type of quality we expect.  Hopefully, IG will look at this stuff 
and get a better idea of what we want to see in the future.

So, how about it?  Who\'s game to start a positive 
what-I-like-about-Traveller thread with me?

Here\'s something that comes to mind directly for me.  It is just a 
small thing, but I think IG did a good job with it.

What I\'m talking about is the way the new Default skills are handled. 
This is something that should have been implemented into Traveller 
long ago.  It makes a lot of sense that some skills can be attempted 
by a lay-man by just blindly attempting the task.  Likewise, it makes 
sense that there are skills out there that cannot be attempted in 
this manner--like brain surgery.

I like the way a character\'s skill set (albeit at a negative) is 
improved because of all of the Default skills.  I\'m not sure why a 
rule like this was not implemented in Traveller before.

Good job, IG.  I like this rule.

That was short, I know, but it is what came to mind first.

Who\'s next?  What do you like about Traveller?

Why don\'t we, here on the list, define exactly for IG the things in 
Book 1 that we would like to see changed before T4-Revised comes out?

I\'m not talking about re-doing an eratta sheet here--what I mean is 
to put together a short list of things that should be looked at and 
revised in the new edition of T4.

This way, if IG listens, they\'ll have a hint of what we are expecting 
in the new book.  I\'m scared that T4-Revised is going to come out, 
and I\'m going to be disappointed in it.  Maybe we TMLers can quell 
some of that by making a short list of the things that need 
attention.

For example:  Skills are given too freely in chargen.  Characters hit 
the game with a level 6 skill, two level 4s, three level 3s, and a 
but load of level 2s and 1s.  I think some sort of roll to achieve 
skill  per year (or some other limiting game mechanic) should be 
imposed so that characters are not so strong coming out of the 
generation process.

Don\'t get me wrong here, though.  I do like a character coming out of 
chargen with a number of different skills--I just don\'t think that 
some of the character\'s specialities should be so high.

The characters generated with the old CT/MT one year method 
generation systems seemed to produce the ballance that T4 needs.  IG 
should use those systems as a guide.

Also, I think that IG should look at the experience system.  This 
thing is way too generous. In just a couple of adventures, a 
character is going to become very powerful using this system.  Some 
sort of limit should be imposed.  This experience system with the 
current chargen system is a lethal combination that produces God-like 
characters.  Game ballance is needed here.

I\'d like to see an experience system that:

1)  Keeps the distinction of experience between default, regular, and 
new skills--like the current system.

2)  Awards points on at the end of each game session.

3) Allows (restricts)  characters to advance about as fast as they 
did in chargen.

4) Makes attaining a new skill level harder the higher skilled the 
character is.

5)  Imposes a time limit ( a learning limit) for those skills that 
require some type of schooling or additional education.


In short form, T4 revised needs--

     A chargen system that is not so generous with the skils.

     An experience system that is not so generous either.


What would you like to see in T4?

I am running my first Traveller campaign (I\'m a long-time fantasy GM) and
am running into trouble.  Please offer suggestions.

1)	One of my players received "Traveller\'s Aid Society" as a mustering-out
benefit from the Navy.  He wonders why he should ever work, since he can
sell a high passage every two months, giving him an excellent income.

2)	The same character was hired to perform a job on a world some 20 jumps
distant from his starting point.  He purchased passage on a free trader
going in the right direction, but brought along several dozen small Tech-11
computers which he sold for profit on mid-tech worlds, reaping an excellent
profit which not only paid his way but afforded him a Cr50,000 profit.
What am I doing wrong? 

3)	This one may be unanswerable.  Traveller has turned my players into gun
nuts.  I\'ve purposfully  allowed very few situations to arise where
firepower is useful, but they\'re constantly looking for them and dreaming
of ways to knock off low-tech governments.  It\'s getting old and infantile
fast.  Any suggestions?

costs them nothing.  Their Web page would be a good start.  In addition,
printing the correct data in JTAS would be an excellent idea.  These simple
steps would say "We want to please our best customers.  We trust you to

complete and correct UWP for each world.  Hell, I\'d be satisfied with an
apology and a list of the correct law and goverment levels in JTAS and the
complete UWPs listed on the IG Web page.

Mostly, while we are justified in feeling that IG is trying to ask us to
forget that it took our money for a fundamentally flawed product, we are
not justified by the comparisons with rape or theft or stupidity.  IG
prints products for our beloved game.  Let\'s use the carrot as well as the
stick.  Rather than call them names, let\'s show them that good customer
relations NOW means continued sales FOR THE FUTURE.

All they\'d need would be a little help from one of the grandkids (one of
those that were smart enough to clone themselves in order to fool Grand-
father into thinking he\'d killed them). Or perhaps one of the greatgrand-

If IG keeps producing TRASH TRAVELLER (TT) let them die. I have been
playing Traveller since 1977-78 era, and I will still be playing Traveller
long after IG is gone. IG does not care one bit as to what "we" want, no
matter how many letters and emails we send them they will not listen. The
plain fact is they consider us atypical customers, meaning we don\'t fit
into their statistical patterns for marketing. I would rather not blow
smoke up their arse but tell them they are screwing up and where. If that
type of input causes them to go under so be it.

Well they are not as poor as we are lead to believe. Many other companies
most even smaller have been able to correct past FUBAR\'s and not go
bankrupt. If fixing FS kills them RIP.

Well as to FS they are not doing that, I can see a pattern of their

Well I will not forget and I believe that those comparisons are correct. I
would rather see Traveller die than see more carp produced for it. As for
customer service "if you can\'t stand the heat get out the kitchen" goes
hand in hand with good customer service and relations. 

By the by I run a post M:0 era do know how long any of the product I have
need have will be produced? A long time from know. I use a bastard kludge
of rules mostly using MT with CT thrown in.

He doesn\'t need to work. In my campaign, I have quite a few characters
who have lots of money (and a few that are dirt-poor). They work
because they find jobs interesting, not because of the cash. One of
them is a millionaire but he also owns a starship, which is expensive
to maintain (especially after combat!). All of them, from time to
time, get thrust into adventures without being asked and without getting
paid.

You are limited only by your imagination.

Nothing. You\'re rewarding a player for showing initiative and 
imagination. Nothing wrong with that. Now, if this player starts to
become disruptive to the game, it\'s time to change things. You
could have his cargo stolen (or, if it\'s live cargo, have it escape).
Pirates could board the ship he\'s one and plunder. The cargo could
turn out to be stolen and some Imperial authorities might wander by
wanting it back. 

There\'s nothing wrong with wealthy characters, IMHO. Just don\'t make
all your adventures end with a payment for success.

Sure. Have them get into a situation where the government they\'re 
trying to knock off has learned of their reputation and has hired
an advanced mercenary team to take them out. If they want to play
gun combat, the mercs will convince them how much REAL combat hurts.
There\'s always somebody with guns bigger than yours; that\'s why
guns aren\'t the answer to most problems.

I\'ve got to second this.  I don\'t generally write "me too" posts,
but I have difficulty believing that this last that we have heard
from IG is in conformance with Marc\'s image of Traveller - or of
a company, however new, that is the public custodian thereof.  I
urge Marc to think long and hard about this question, and _be_
_honest_with_yourself_.  Then, sit down and have a heart-to-
heart talk with the appropriate people at IG, and keep in the
back of your mind that Roger Sanger/DGP would very likely take
Traveller in a New York microsecond, were it to be offered.

It needed to be said.  I have been reluctant to be the one to say
it; I consider it to be out-of-character for me to be vehement
about _anything_ - and vehemence would have been necessary to
properly express my feelings on the matter.  Paul has said
everything I have been thinking, and has done a masterly job of
it.

I understand that business considerations are important to a
business; I also realize that satisfying the customers is the
best way to maximize the probability of success.  Apple learned
it the hard way (or maybe not); if they hadn\'t looked solely at
the bottom line, they might have been able to keep the IBM PC
from killing the Apple II line - and might also have been able to
make the Mac more of a success than it was.  Ditto Commodore.
WordPerfect made a purely bottom-line business decision to end
unlimited 800 support.  Less than a year later, they sold all
their assets to Novell, and folded.  Novell tried to ride on a
perceived success, and did nothing with it - and sold it - at a
loss - to Corel. Corel is trying - but they\'re fighting an uphill
battle, and I think it may be too late.  One decision very nearly
killed a product, and did kill a company.

The nature of RPGs makes the survivability of a specializing
company inherently more volatile.  The customers can make you or
break you - even more than they did for WordPerfect - because if
you don\'t have something that\'s both unique and non-portable,
they can take what they like from you, and combine it with what
they like from your competitors.  That\'s an open threat - not
from me, from the marketplace.  If you don\'t take it seriously,
you lose.  GDW didn\'t take customer comments seriously, and
didn\'t take Steve Jackson Games seriously - and I date the death
of GDW to the day that they chose not to react to the release of
the GURPS Basic Set - which was so much like Traveller, but
"fixed" in some ways, that sourcebook/background information was
easily and practically instantly portable.  IG is at a
disadvantage to start - a single background (although the
multiple milieux helps in that respect), and a system that
doesn\'t strongly compete with GURPS, inarguably one of the most
popular systems available today. Add to that a distinct lack of
public press, and an apparent inability (unwillingness?) to get
shelf space where you might have a shot at broad-based sales
(Barnes and Noble, for starts - they\'ve got D&D and Star Wars,
both of which have name recognition and guaranteed sales - but
they\'ve also got GURPS in at least some stores.  Why GURPS, and
not Traveller?), and you\'re operating with a major handicap. The
poor start and inconsistent quality since do not inspire
unreserved confidence.  Are you going to add offending your core
constituency to that?

Ignoring for the minute any possibility of personal bias due to
my participation here, Marc and IG (and GDW before them - but
they pretty much ignored us) have an incredible resource,
critiquing service, and cheering section here in the Traveller
Mailing List. This is a "core constituency" that admittedly has a
certain image of what Traveller is/should be - but I have never
seen criticism that was outright unfair; as a group, the List has
not proven to be particularly excitable over minor errors or
questionable design.  Yes, we\'ll debate the merits of the
half-die, or the handwaving over frac-cee rocks, or the structure
of a feudal (futile?) technocracy, until the cows that finally
came home turn blue in the face. And we\'ll have differences of
opinion over them for just that long, and we\'ll each agree to do
whatever "feels right" for our particular campaigns.  We\'ll agree
to disagree on the small stuff; we understand what RPGs are all
about.  But that in itself should be a clue that when opinion is
universally against a decision, as it was in the case of
Starships, and is in the current case of M0/FS, something is
inarguably badly wrong - a big "GK" or "SOS" in flashing red
letters, with bells, whistles, and sirens.

With the limited (or non-existant?) advertising for Traveller,
your "core constituency" from the paragraph above is pretty much
your primary source of new players.  We talk to our gaming
friends, we bring them into our games, we tell them what\'s going
on, we try to sell them on our favorite system.  We are your best
advertising. Convince us that what we are doing for your benefit
is "morally indefensible", and you become the proverbial snowball
with no hope of Salvation.  I don\'t believe anyone here wants
that.  But I also believe that, after the experience with the
last days of GDW, many if not most of us feel that it would be
better to murder Traveller outright, than for it to suffer death
by slow torture.  This isn\'t melodrama - this is reality, and you
ignore it at your peril.

There\'s a lot of support for Traveller out there - look at your
own links page, the Traveller Webring, and/or the Freelance
Traveller links page if you don\'t believe me.  Look at what
mailing lists are available - this one, GDW-Beta, Pocket Empires,
THUDDD, and the Traveller Language Project.  Look at the kind of
material that\'s appearing in all of these places - detailed
examinations of minor races (Kenji\'s Sayat, and Joe\'s Suerrat),
writeups of planets (the RICE and BARD Papers), alternative task
systems (Eris\'s "D66" system and Ken\'s 2.0), extensions to the
UWP, and interpretations connected therewith (my "RICE Paper" on
extending the Starport code, and my recent article on stellar
traffic), the writeups and partial writeups and background
material for campaigns (the Near Bootes Cluster campaign, and the
Earth Colonies campaign), the sector detailing projects (Jim\'s
GALACTIC program and associated mailing list, the History of the
Imperium Working Group, the Yiklerdanzh project), and so on.  We
don\'t do this because we\'re being paid to, or because we want to
see any particular company become a success, or other companies
fail.  We do it for one reason, and one reason only - we like
Traveller.  Or maybe I should use that other four-letter dirty
word - we LOVE Traveller.  If we didn\'t, why would we be wasting
our time and energy on it?

The company that is the custodian of Traveller is truly in a
_leadership_ position.  Not a dictatorial position - if you try
to dictate to us, and say "Thus Traveller shall be; all else is
heresy", we\'ll tell you in no uncertain terms to get stuffed.
Only "stuffed" isn\'t the word we\'ll use.  But, raise a flag that
we can rally to without offending our own consciences, and give
us the Traveller that we can continue to love, and we\'ll follow
you to Hell itself - except that if you give us that kind of
Traveller, you wouldn\'t be going anywhere near Hell. We, the
"core constituency", don\'t _need_ IG to play and enjoy Traveller,
or to keep it alive - Traveller has a long enough and honorable
enough history to sustain us, nostalgically.  But the level of
support, and our willingness to give you our opinions, and our
ideas for solutions to perceived problems, should be an
indication that we _want_ a leader we can follow. The evidence is
that IG _can_ do it - but the important question is not ability,
but _desire_.  Does IG _want_ to lead us into the future of
Traveller?  That question appears to be still open, but there\'s
some doubt.  As Marc was urged earlier to consider the question
of whether IG has done justice to _his_ idea of _his_ property,
IG must also be urged to the same kind of introspection: Is IG
willing to make the investment, in money, but more importantly in
"moral fiber", to "own up" to past errors, to promise to do
better, and to listen to those  people, individually and
collectively, who don\'t "do Traveller" for any reason other than
love?  Again, a public statement is not necessary - but honesty
with _oneself_ _is_.

Marc and IG both have something to think about.  The members of
this list probably do, too - primarily about the best way to
offer our guidance, without sounding like bitchy, petulant little
children who are going to throw temper tantrums if we don\'t get
our way.  I believe that, for the most part, our  reactions and
opinions - on the big issues - _is_ ultimately in the best
interests of Traveller, as a game.  But I also admit that I may
be biased.  I think that _we_, the customers, need to think long
and hard about whether something is good _for_ _the_game_, before
we go off on IG about a decision.  And when we _do_ go off, we
shouldn\'t _emote_ about it; we should marshall our reasons in
logic, and present our arguments coherently and calmly, without
making threats of abandonment, and without being pejorative or
using invective.

I think I\'ve said my piece here.  But I will add that I invite
considered discussion on any and all points that I have made
here.  Also, in spite of the fact that Marc and IG aren\'t
expected to tell us of the results of their respective
introspection, I would encourage them both to participate in this
discussion, and, _if_and_only_if_ they feel comfortable doing so,
to tell us of the results of their introspection, and the reasons
that they came to the conclusions they did.  I believe that at
this point in time, a frank and open dialogue, while perhaps not
_necessary_, will be more productive than further recrimination
and other ranting.  I hope the rest of the list is in agreement
with me.

Permission is explicitly granted to repost this in other
Traveller-related forums, to encourage and extend the discussion
I have invited.  If you do, please let me know that you have, and
where, and remember to include proper credit.

When EA was released they did receive credit, we all thought the bad

backwards with this FS fudge.  Yes we asked for a corrected T4 rulebook and
mostly thats what we\'re going to get, but when it came to FS we asked for
corrected data (not fudged data) and for this information to be put up on
the errata web pages.  IG have obviously ruled this out.

It\'s the people that have already bought the book who are calling for the
correct data to be published (whether on the the web, JTAS or printed),
double-duh.  If the correct data is available for download then it costs
nothing to distribute, it cost virtually nothing to the customer to
download.  Previous customers of FS will then have the correct LL data that
can be used with their 1st edition.  Future purchasers get the correct data.

It\'s not a fix, it\'s a fudge.  If the Law Level data is made available to
previous purchasers it wont invalidate the rest of their book (just the
broken law level bit).  It might well be inconvienient to lookup a UWP in FS
and then search through a list to find the correct LL, but thats more
preferable to shelling out more cash for a patch.

Your right it is a kludge, it is IG papering over the cracks, it is IG
inventing canon (LL does not exist in M0) because of a screw up.  Why is
there a correct Law level for Sylea and not for other worlds of the Sylean
federation with which Sylea has been trading and interacting with for many
years?, why is there a correct law level for Azimuth/Core (0202)?.  Law
level is an integral and important part of the UWP.  Was there a law level
digit during the first and second imperiums?, did Sylean Fed. planetary
scientists forget the knowledge to calculate LL during the long night?.

Isn\'t Anomolies also a product of a T4 core subsector map screw up?

It doesn\'t make things better either.  IG is taking the easier way out,

Of course it\'s not economically feasible and so far I haven\'t seen anyone
seriously suggesting they do that.

T>(And don\'t tell me what the Star Wars

T>Lucasfilm behind them!)

It\'s not irrelevant, it\'s an example.  WEG don\'t have LucasFilm behind them
and they don\'t have LucasFilm\'s bucks either. As far as I know it\'s a one
way relationship: WEG give money to LucasFilm for the license and the
privilage to publish SW.  LucasFilm aren\'t there to bail them out if they
screw up.

Like I\'ve mentioned above, distributing the Law Level data in a downloadable
format will cost IG peanuts.  For those without internet access the correct
data can be published in JTAS (maybe with a note to say that the data can be
freely photocopied and so ensuring that the data will be distributed to all
those who require it).  IG could also send the data to those who send them
an SAE.

This is what WEG did for the SW rules upgrade, something they didn\'t have to
do as the original 2nd edition rules were playable anyway.  Those who wanted
the upgrade got it, and there were few complaints. 

I\'m not asking for all UWP data to be made available just world name,
Location, and Law Level (and maybe pop. for Vland).  This wont effect the
future sales of M0 Campaign as the requested data on it\'s own is useless
without the rest of the UWP from FS.

The result: those FS purchasers get the LL data they requested (and will
feel that IG has done the right thing), and future purchasers of M0 Campaign
get the correct LL data but wont be any the wiser.

For T4Deluxe they have done mostly what we\'ve asked.  For FS we asked for
correct LL data, not a fudge, not a work around, not a patch up, just the
correct LL made freely distributable.  It\'s not an unreasonable request. 
This is not what we\'re getting.

I think that you are wrong here.  Given IG\'s track record, people are 
getting pissed.  They are tired of expensive, substandard product and 
idiotic decisions like, "Well, we know it is broken, but let\'s go 
ahead and reprint the crap anyway."

Sometimes yelling at someone IS the best way to get their attention, 
but what I think what you are seeing is a number of people just 
getting fed up.  These people are tired of being let down.

Feelings of betrayal and disappointment are sometimes strong 
justifications for what people say and do.

OTOH, I guess both you and I were thinking in the same direction last 
night.  I\'m trying to take a more constructive tact as well--notice 
the "IG Positive Thread" and "T4-Revised" posts.

I\'m holding my head up for IG one more time.  Hell, I want IG to 
succeed.    

But, I\'m banking on stretched faith here.  I sure hope IG is 
listening, because as a determined fan, I am, with effort, turning my 
comments in a more constructive approach.

I\'ll try it your way--one more time.

You can sell the High Passages for 90% of their face value.  Cr9,000 
is not an excellent income.  There are plenty of things that he is 
going to have to buy.

Among other things that pop up in the game (buying weapons, ammo, 
armor, replacing equipment, miscellaneous costs like food and 
lodging, licenses, etc.), I use a general method designed to simulate 
general purchasing.

A character will, like all of us in real life, spend money on all 
types of crap--toothpaste, entertainment, clothes, souveniers, etc.  
Money evaporates from a character\'s pocket just like it does for real 
people.

Ever ballanced your check book a week after you\'ve been paid and 
wonder where the hell did all the money go?  Taking you friend out to 
lunch, buying those new sneakers, and getting that new CD adds up.

MT has an excellent rule for this.  Check out page 30 of the MT 
Player\'s Manual.  There, it says that a character will spend Cr250 x 
Soc per month on incidentals.  Ordinary purchases, like buying 
equipment or obtaining a High Passage does not count towards this 
total.

In my game, I allow for the time the characters are on the ship.  
Since they are in space during this time, they have no where to go 
for their money to evaporate.

I keep track of time using the Imperial Calander (My copy is from the 
MT Referee\'s Companion, but you can find it in a number of other 
supplements including T4\'s Starships).  

On this chart, I record all sorts of things for the 
campaign--birthdays, ship subsidy payments, the Emperor\'s Birthday 
(holiday), etc.  I check off the days as they are played in the game.
I\'ll put either an "H" in the day\'s box if the character\'s were in 
jumpspace during that day or a "S" if the character\'s were on the 
ship but in normal space.

Then peridodically (every four weeks), I count the number of days 
played that the character\'s were not on the ship.  I ask each 
player what his average incidental monthly expenditure is (Cr250 x 
Soc is recorded in the notes section of the character\'s sheet--if you 
need a character sheet, I\'ll let you have a copy of the one I 
designed).  I figure a per day charge for each character, and I only 
charge the characters for the time spent off the ship.

In this manner, money evaporates as fast from their pockets as it 
does mine.

If you want to decrease the character\'s disposable income, you are 
probably not charging him enough for things.

As I said above, Traveller character\'s sometimes benefit because we 
don\'t charge them for anything except major purchases--equipment and 
so forth.  I wish real life was like this.  What is missing is the 
incidental charges.  We don\'t have to play out every little purchase 
of chewing gum, sunglasses, shampoo, and underware.  That\'s what I 
use the MT rule for that I detailed above.

Let\'s see.  That\'s 20 jumps, right?  Since a ship usually spends one 
week in port and one in jumpspace, as a general rule, the character 
spent 40 weeks travelling.  That\'s three quarters of a year.

If the character\'s Soc was 7, he\'d spend Cr1,750 per month on 
incidentals.  Just charging this character for the 20 weeks he spent 
planetside during this trip, I would charge the character Cr8,750 for 
his incidentals.  Now, he\'s got Cr41,250 instead of his original 
Cr50,000.

Sure.  Put them in situations that they can\'t handle.

If they knocked off a whole government, I\'d find it kinda hard to 
believe that this could be done that easily.  Let\'s say you\'ve got 
five PC\'s with Battle Dress and PGMP\'s.  They are on a TL 5 world.

They\'d reak some havoc, at first, but eventually, they would be 
outnumbered--I don\'t care how powerful the five are.

These TL 5 bubbas would eventually find a way to stop the 5 Battle 
Dress killers--maybe they\'d swarm \'em, and tie them down with a net 
or something.

Is there a Naval base on the planet?  If so, you job just got easier.

But, let\'s say that the five did come in and tear up the government 
buildings and killed several people--then they left planet without 
being stopped.

That planet is a memeber of the Imperium.  They are going to complain 
to the higher authorities, and in this case, these higher authorities 
is the Imperial government.  Before long, the Imperial Navy is 
looking for a ship that matches the player\'s.  They\'ve got the 
transponder code from the starport.  Word is sent by XBoat to all 
worlds in the subsector to detain these individuals on sight.

They\'ve got to have their Universal IDs checked when they land at a 
starport, right?  Otherwise, they are detained anyway.

Pretty soon, the character\'s are going to be caught.  Maybe they\'ll 
be apprehended in a starport, or maybe an Imperial Navy Destroyer 
will pick them up.  At that time, let them decide if they want to 
fight it out or not.

What you should do next time the players start acting like this is 
think to yourself what would happen in real life.  Say a group of 
merchant seamen land at an African port, pull their high tech machine 
guns that they got from when they were in the States, and start 
blowing people away.  What would happen?

You might also want to start having fun with this instead of letting 
it get to you and ruin the enjoyment of the game.  You\'re the GM--be 
creative.

If this happened in my game, I\'d work it into the story.  If they 
blew away some people on a low tech planet, I might decide that one 
of the government officials that they killed was a member of a 
powerful noble house.  The poor chap was sent to that rock to earn 
pay his dues before daddy, the baron, put him in a position of more 
importance.

Then, the PCs have come along and blown him away.  Word gets back to 
daddy, who informs the correct authorities, but also decides on a 
course of action himself.

Before long, the player\'s not only have to deal with the Imperial 
Navy, but the baron\'s hired guns as well.  Maybe they are bounty 
hunters, or maybe they are just plain hit men--whatever the case, the 
players better hope that the Navy catches up with them first.

This does mean that the Sylean Federation built their first jump-3 ships 150

Well, the first \'modern\' coyn set (as opposed to the one(s?) used in the 
heyday of the Ancients) was introduced by Yaskodray ca. 50,000 years ago,
and that one didn\'t have Aslan, Hiver, or K\'Kree coyns. According to _Secret
of the Ancients_ p. 32 he \'...continued to refine these coyns [...]; over
time, they came to show various races (Aslan, Hiver, K\'Kree) which did not
even exist when Droyne ranged the stars.\'

So the coyn sets of Mileau 1100 Droyne societies is propably no more than
2000 years old or thereabouts.

Remind him, by having the TAS and local cops look into it, that these

Well, letting him get away with it.  This journey should be made all the 
more difficult by all the different fines, tarriffs, taxes, pirates, 
inspections, customs, etc that you can dream up and put into your game 
with out losing the consistency :)

This one is the easiest.  Let them knock off a few lo-tech governments 
and let the Imperial Marines deal with them.  This is not something the 
Imperium ( of any Milieu ) views lightly if the world is an Imperial 
world.

Another beauty is to show them how dangerous a lower tach can be.  I had 
to take someone out once with a TL-5 fighter and a 1000 lb bomb once.  It 
will humble the rest of the players a bit.  Do you know what a tank does 
to battle dress when it runs over it?  Makes this nice satisfying crunchy 
sound not unlike that of a lobster in the crackers :)

I\'m sure there are less violent options, but these should help you ( and 
I\'m in one hell of a mood today ).

Go right ahead, there are lots of GM\'s out there who love to steal ...err.

\'Gearhead-only\' arguing aside, that IS one of the chartered reasons for

I think that a lot of the heat that IG is taking right now is due to
pent-up frustration, and what many people see as disregard for the
pocketbooks of the early adopters, like us.

As you say in your message, WE are the ones who rushed out and bought
everything, WE are the ones who roundly criticized those things that were
broken, WE are the ones (in part) who made IG realize their mistakes, and
make their current attempt to fix things.

You\'re right, to a large extent IG did listen to what we had to say; the
future of Traveller may well be better off for all this, with properly
edited and proofread books, better reality checking at all points in the
process, new writers and better editorial control by Marc himself.

For all that, I don\'t think that a couple of printed pages with corrected
law levels for the systems detailed in FS and M0, or an errata sheet
detailing this mysterious Law level fix is out of line, too expensive, or
threatening to their bottom line for IG to distribute. Hell, they could
put it up on their web site as a PDF file which would cost essentially
NOTHING to distribute. 

People aren\'t complaining that IG is doing this, hell, people aren\'t even
complaining about being beta-testers.  What people are
complaining about is being _paying_ beta testers, customers who will have 
to pay _double_ because of what they pointed out to IG. I\'ve said it
before...many of the people buying Traveller right now, like much of this
list (I can\'t speak for the many lurkers out there) liking IG or T4 or not
at this point, are the very audience that IG can\'t afford to lose, we\'re
the evangelists, the ones who bug the shop owners to carry stuff, the ones
who bug the shop owners for space to hold games.

Such loyalty is hard to come by, and a valuable resource; I hope IG
realizes that this is too valuable to squander by not printing some usable
errata for FS and M0. Starships, I think everyone has given up on, T4
errata are out there, and everyone likes CSC and EA, so far, other than
_another_ incompatible design system. (the latter, IMHO is ok...I can draw
a fairly easily defined line between a vehicle and a spaceship, and work
around it...ymmv)

Hell, even printing the 32 \'missing\' pages for M0 owners out there
couldn\'t be all that expensive, charge me $3 or $5 for it...I won\'t feel
cheated by paying reasonable production costs for it (unless it\'s like the
legendary missing 15 minutes of \'2001\'...which was mostly Keir Dullea\'s
heavy breathing ;-) 

What I WILL feel cheated by is having to shell out another $25 to
duplicate something I have already just to get that damned errata sheet!

Unfortunately, all the references I have to TAS membership state that the
member may sell their high passage or use it as they see fit.

For example:

So sayeth Book 1, Page 22, Verse the sixth

"...And they feasted on breakfast ceral, and spam, and sloth, and..

Ooops wrong book...

CT LBB1 "Characters and Combat", pg 22 paragraph 6:

"Every month it [TAS] pays a dividend in the form of one High Passage
ticket to each member. This passage may be taken, used, accumulated, sold,
or otherwise disposed of." 

	What bothers me, is that SOMEwhere, I read a description of the
Traveller\'s Aid Society, that mentioned it was only the latest of a number
of such organizations, the previous one\'s had \'blackballed\' themselves to
death. The reference I remember was fairly clear that TAS dated from the
early 00\'s of the Imperium...maybe 400 or 500.

This would invalidate anyone getting TAS as a benefit in M0

What am I remembering?

I said this about Paul\'s post--now, I\'m saying it again, about Jeff\'s 
post.

Where Paul captured all of the emotion that I\'ve been feeling about 
IG, Jeff has captured all the thoughts in the left side of my brain.

I agree 1000% with what Jeff has said.  I was going to copy pieces of 
it to comment on, but on my first try to a repy, I found that I was 
quoteing the entire post.  

Suffice it to say that Jeff has covered it all and written his words 
well.  IG would do well to take heed of what he has said.

Again, I wish I would have written it.

No, I\'m not -that- bad a GM.  I can show them what a bad idea that would
be.  They haven\'t tried, but that\'s mostly because they know, out of
character, that I\'d hate it.  These guys are constantly dreaming of ways to
use Tech to kill things, which just seems infantile to me.

Good idea.  Here\'s mine:

I have always loved the Traveller setting.  I think that the Imperium has a
great history, and a setting that abounds with enough enemies and obstacles
and just plain stuff.  Therefore, I have always liked the setting-related
materials best.  I like M:0.  I liked TNE a lot, especially where it talked
about setting.  I look forward to The Long Way Home.

Since I -never- want to have to design a ship or anything else, I get a
great deal of use out of Emperor\'s Arsenal and Central Supply Catalog, even
Starships, though I do wish for the good feeling I get when I hear the
gearheads say that something is well designed.

So, IG, for my dollars, Traveller books should have as much campaign detail
as possible, and maps are always good.  When you make technical manuals,
please continue to use the style and layout you used in EA, which I like a
- -lot-.

And please, keep on making Traveller!

Also a good idea. 

First, I\'d like to echo Ken\'s comments on the Character Generation and
Experience systems.  Too generous.  Please make skills harder to acquire,
especially at higher levels.

Second, my own suggestions:

1)	Maps.  A map of  Known Space really should be included.  It could even
include the boundaries of various milieux.

2)	All the charts should be gathered together in the back of the book for
quick reference.

3)	Examples of ground combat and ship-to-ship combat would be useful.

If you are using the rules and not the setting; why change? What do you need
to add to the rules? Exclude the Imperium setting, and CT or selected
subsets of MT or TNE provide all you might need.

As I have noted before, the consequences of their own actions can cause
players more problems that anything a GM could dream up.

Gun nuts?  Sting \'em with an undercover operation by law enforcement to
catch people buying illegal fire arms. Check out the rules on firearms and
law levels of on any world. Same for Government codes. The more restrictive
the type of government, the more likely the PC gun nuts will wonder into an
illeagl weapons deal and a sting. You don\'t have to kill \'em, but a couple
years at hard labor will be a pause to think.

Over throw low tech governments. Just because you declare yourself the boss
doesn\'t mean you are listened to. Low tech, but popular rulers will stage an
insurrection. Kill the rulers and you make martyrs.  And there is also the
group of NPCs that decide to follow the PCs\' lead. Since the PCs are now the
unpopular heads of an illegal government, the equally well equiped NPCs
could be hired, on a Mercenary Ticket, to remove them. 

There is no free lunch. Anything that a hyperactive PC can dream of doing to
an NPC and be done to the PC by an NPC.

	Any success - jump fuel succesfully bled off into space.
	Small failure - capacitors overload, all enginerring crew suffer
from...what? Roll 3d damage (or something else nasty)
	Medium Failure - jump drive rendered inoperative, fuel leakage, all
enginerring crew killed.
	Bad failure - entire engineering deck destroyed, ship cannot maneuvre.
	Catastrophic failure - ship destroyed.

	Maybe I\'ve missed something, as I\'ve only been back a while, so please
excuse any ignorance on my part if the basis of this posting is incorrect.

	Unless you have some form of jump governor, you can\'t stop a j-drive from
using all the available fuel whether a ship does a jump-1 or jump-2
maneuver, right? Meaning that if you have an amount of fuel that\'s enough
for a jump-2, it may all be used up in a jump-1.

	Possible fix: Sorry if it\'s been mentioned before, but why not put the
jump fuel into separate fuel tanks? They can be rigged up with fuel lines
that can be interchanged for a jump-1 or 2 or whatever, or the multiple
fuel holds could be situated next to each other with a retractable
partition so that it becomes a say jump-2 fuel hold instead of two 1\'s, if
all the fuel must be in one compartment that is. Whad\'ya reckon, possible?

	See ya...

   Yep, I do. The relativistic equation equivalent to v = at
   is 

   	v = c * sin( arctan(at/c) ),

   which assumes constant acceleration, no flips at midpoint, etc.

> Also, I take it you are assuming that accel. reamains

   I am not sure what you mean here, but let me tell you what I meant,
   since I neglected to specify in my previous post.  I assume constant
   acceleration A to be the G-forces that the crew would experience if
   their inertial compensators broke down: ie, the ship\'s thrust divided
   by its rest mass.  This definition of A is invariant regardless of
   reference frame; it\'s the acceleration the ship /would have in a
   frame where the ship is not moving relativistically/.  In other
   words, it\'s the plain, old, what-you\'re-used-to, Traveller,
   manuever-drive rating.

   As seen from a planet, the ship is accelerating rather more "slowly"
   than the crew experiences it. To find the acceleration, A\', in the
   planetary frame:

   	A\' = A * tau^3  (for acceleration along the direction of motion)

   where tau = cos(arcsin(v/c)) = 1/gamma.

   Here\'s a brief recap of my previous post, included for easy
   reference:

   ----
   Conventions:

   All distances in meters, times in seconds, acceleration in meters per
   second squared (where 1G = 10 m/s^2, 2G = 20 m/s^2, and so on). All
   equations assume that the ship starts from rest at the origin,
   accelerates to midpoint and then decelerates to rest at the
   destination.

   D = distance in meters
   A = acceleration in m/s^2, as experienced by the starship\'s crew
   t = dialated time as experienced by the starship\'s crew
   T = undialated time as experienced by the planetary populations
   c = speed of light: 300,000,000 meters per second

   D = (c^2/A) * (  sqrt(4+(A*T/c)^2) - 2  )
   T = (c/A) * sqrt( (A*D/c^2)*(A*D/c^2 + 4) )

   D = (1/4) * A * t^2
   t = sqrt(4*D/A)
   A = 4*D / t^2

The needs of a starspaning empire are many and varied.  This is an attempt to 
detail some of the forces that the Imperium would have.

This attempt is not going to detail any of the supporting bureaucracy and 
nobility except where those entities may affect the military forces.

General Overview
My overview is that the empire is made up of it\'s member states and these may 
vary from single planets to entire stellar groupings.  Each of these member 
states is responsible for it\'s own internal governance and contributes to the 
imperial purse by taxes and levies.

The Imperial Navy
The Imperium has one major force.  The Imperial Navy.  In time of war all 
Imperial Assets revert to control by the Imperial Navy.  In many cases this 
control is not used and the asset continues under normal operations, but the 
Imperial Navy retains the right to use any Imperial asset in time of war.
During peacetime the Imperial Navy is patrolling the space between worlds, 
providing transport for dignitaries, planning putative actions and generally 
keeping the peace.
Many organs of the Imperial Bureaucracy rely on the Imperial Navy for 
intelligence provided by the Department of Imperial Naval Intelligence and it 
is this department that provides for many of the imperiums covert agents both 
internal and external.
The Imperial Navy is organised into Fleets.  There are three classes of 
Imperial Navy fleets.  The Subsector Fleets, the Sector Fleets, and the Domain 
Fleets.  Planetary fleets are the responsibility of the individual member 
states.
(Please note that a Fleet is not the same as a fleet.  A Fleet is an 
administrative grouping and a fleet is a group of ships)
Subsector Fleets are subdivided into task forces and dipersed through the 
entire subsector.  A Subsector fleet task force can range in size from a single 
patrol cruiser up to a full fleet.  The Subsector Fleet Headquarters is 
generally located on the subsector capital but in any cases it will always be 
placed to best effect in terms of command and control.  Subsector Fleets are 
the first response force of the Imperium.
Sector Fleets are also subdivided into task forces but it is extremely rare for 
a Sector Fleet Task force to be less than a fleet.  The Sector Fleet 
Headquarters is often moved and generally put in ready reaction range of
any forseen troublespots.  Sector Fleets provide the main offensive forces of 
the Imperium and act as the hammer against the Subsector Fleets Anvil.
Domain Fleets are Headquartered at the Domains Naval Depot, or if it does not 
have one then at the Domain Capital.  Domain Fleets are the last line of 
defense for the Imperium and also include many of the extra support resources, 
such as Depot\'s, Courier Networks, additional Transport fleets etc?

The Imperial Marines
The Imperial Marines are designed to act as the Imperial Navy\'s Ground Attack 
unit.  They are supported and transported by the Imperial Navy.  They do not 
act without Imperial Navy consent.
During peacetime Imperial Marines are used as Imperial Embassy Guards, escorts 
for imperially favored Nobles and a ready reaction force.  A Marine regiment 
serves on a three year cycle which covers one year on board ship as ready 
reaction forces, one year in garrison and one year in shore duty assignments 
(such as embassy guards etc).
Imperial Marines are not used as ships troops.  This role is performed 
internally by Imperial Navy personnel.  Imperial Marines are carried onboard 
some ships but in an assault role only and generally have sufficient equipment 
to survive on a hostile world for up to three weeks in fighting trim.
The Imperial Marines are used for pinpoint strategic and tactical assaults. 
 They are rarely used as a bludgeon but are instead tasked with specific 
strikes to achieve an overall result.  As an example, Imperial Marines would be 
used to assault a planetary based meson screen emplacement that protects a city 
and then the Imperial Navy can use the city as a bargaining point.
Without the Imperial Marines the Imperial Navy would be able to reduce a planet 
to slag but couldn\'t really force it to terms but with Imperial Marines it can 
make very specific points.

The Imperial Army
There is no actual Imperial Army.  Except for some units based on the Emperor\'s 
personal holdings which are called the Imperial Guard no structure exists that 
could be called the Imperial Army.  Instead, there is a department of the 
Imperial Navy that coordinates activities involving tasks not suited to the 
Imperial Marines.  This department is known informally as the Imperial Army. 
  It calls up forces from the Member states of the Imperium and arranges for 
their transport to the task theatre.  It is the Member states responsibility to 
ensure that training is up to standard and to provide for the logistics needs 
of the called up units.
This department also arranges for training structures to be similar and 
promotes a degree of standardization across the Imperium to ensure member 
states are able to work and fight together.

   Very true.  No way I\'d ever switch to 3D starmaps (unless, of course,
   I was doing some real-life astrophysics).

   Ahh, I wasn\'t specific enough in locating the part of the manuever
   drive that radiates magic; sorry!  The magical part of the manuever
   drive is the part that relates to the power plant.  Any HEPlaR drive
   that can push a million-kg type-S scout courier is going to give out
   scads of power.  How much?  Let\'s use the specific impulse you
   mention below: 700 km/s.  For a million-kg scout courier with 2G
   acceleration, a 700km/s HEPlar drive would yield 10^13 watts,
   10 million megawatts.  For a ship with a 500 MW power plant (CT),
   this is quite a power load (for CT, where manuever drives require
   power) or quite a windfall (for T4, where HEPlaR yields power). 
   There is a "play-balance" (as opposed to magical 8^) fudge factor in
   conservation of momentum and energy of about 20,000.  Not to worry,
   though!  With a little optimization, it\'s trivial to reduce this
   fudge factor to a mere 1000 or so.

   So "Hard Science Fiction (TM)" requires that our manuever drives be
   much slower (contra canon) or that power in Trav be much easier to
   come by than Striker, MT, and FFS state (contra canon), or that
   reaction fuel requirements be MUCH higher than any rules I\'ve seen
   state (contra canon).  So we have to pick between "Hard Science
   Fiction (TM)" and canon.  No contest for me really. 8^)

   Oops, sorry if I implied that GDW or DGP ever called Traveller
   "hard".  Actually, I recall Marc Miller himself explicitly telling
   me that Traveller manuever drives don\'t obey physics; he made no
   apologies for that either.  Nor should he, IMHO.  But other people
   seem to be under the impression that it is hard.  This impression is
   erroneous, IMNSHO.

   Hmmm. According to my textbook, S is called the specific impulse. 
   For non-relativistic rockets, like the one in my example, it is also
   the exhaust speed relative to the rocket, as you correctly point out.

   Oh sure, I agree.  But look at the /power/ output you get from these
   things: a simple scout courier could fire Trav\'s biggest and baddest
   weapons if it just siphoned off a little of its manuever drive
   output for other purposes.  This paradox requires a fix ---- this fix
   is what I called magic.

   Conclusion:  Traveller manuever drives are inconsistant with
   (take your pick)

   1) Striker, MT, and FFS  (throw out some of the canon)
   	or
   2) Physics (bring in some of the magic)

   As much as I\'ve fooled around with option (1), I still /play/ using
   option (2).  And I still have a really good time!

Okay, I only know that pocket universe, the one with the three worlds

Let\'s calm down a little on the IG front - the next thing we\'ll have is T4
book burnings and trials to see who plays anything third edition.

I think we have a concensus that we are irritated at the prices we are
playing for products that are in the main failing to reach the standards we
expect having seen GDW and DGP. But, give IG some credit, they are trying
now. The last few books (M0 EA, and CSC) have been a lot better. The layout
still needs work, and the internal consistency needs the co-ordination that
Marc is hopefully giving it.

They do need to look at prices - and they need to consider the artwork
seriously. They also need to look at other manufacturers prices...

M0C has irritated everyone by the statement that the FS bugs are staying
in. Personally, I\'m very disappointed, but would be satisfied if they
corrected the big messes (Vland, too many type A and B etc) and left the
new LL details for us to do if necessary. I\'d also like to see the font and
style more reminisent of the late DGP and GDW sector maps so it\'s useable
and also an INDEX!

Personally, I\'m considering each release on its own merits. If they don\'t
meet the standard, they don\'t get my 16 UKP.  I\'m not blanket saying T4 is
broke so I\'m bin-ing it.

For most Traveller ships the change in Mass is negligible.  But, for the large 
rocket type boosters it was recommended in Fire, Fusion and Steel that you 
recalculate thrust for each 10% of fuel used and generated a total "thrust 
impulse" by calculating the thrust per 10% increment times the Time taken to 
burn that fuel (e.g 1 G for 1 minute is 1 Gee-Minute or 1/60 Gee-Hour).  As the 
rules in TNE gave Gee-Hour requirements for getting to orbit this worked quite 
well.

So I guess I\'m saying that "Yes, the change in mass is important but in most 
traveller ships (using HEPlaR anyway) the mass change is negligible"

Ken, it\'s not that starting characters have too many skills, it\'s that
there are too *few* skills to pick from during character generation. 
Double the number of skill *choices* and don\'t allow complete free choice,
then you make it harder to get above 2 or 3 in any one.

Characters starting game play in their 30\'s and 40\'s *should* be strong and
about as highly skilled as they are going to get.
Speaking as an old guy, I plan to continue to learn new skills and improve
on those I already have, but I also realise I don\'t pick things up as fast
now as it did in my twenties.

I agree here.  My solution is divide skill points by 5 to get the portion
that\'s added into the Target number.  Experience goes up 5 times more
slowly this way.  ;-> I also don\'t give experience points all that often
either.

Ah, yes!  I made that mistake early on too.  ;-> You can\'t use TAS as it
appears in the book unless you saddle your player some expenses. 
Personally, I just changed the TAS benefit.

In my game a TAS membership means, the member:

1.  Can stay at TAS hotels at a *very* cheap rate.  Non-members pay
    full rate..if there is space available.

2.  Gets a steep discount for passages on ships of many (but not
    all) lines.

3.  Can use the lounge, bar, and all other services in any TAS club.
    Non-members pay a steep cover charge, unless accompaning a
    member, to get into the public areas and don\'t have access to
    non-public areas.

4.  Can exchange credits (or other currency) for local currency at
    any TAS club at a fair rate of exchange.
    
5.  Can use TAS resources to help gather information on local
    conditions or nearby systems.
    
6.  Has access to dependable local lawyers, brokers, doctors and
    other professonals a Traveller might need.
    
7.  Is covered by a large insurance policy and bond...for bail ;->
    
In short, TAS is like a dependable *private* Consolate the members can
depend on for help without involving the government.  And TAS has clubs
everywhere!

Maybe nothing.  OTOH, you might be making it too easy for him to make a
profit.  Maybe he gets into a beef with a customs agency on some planet,
and they take all his profits away in fines and duties, have him get taken
by some trader when he buys more items for speculative trade, or just let
him make some money.  He\'ll need it if he wants to buy his own ship. ;->

It depends on the kind of game you\'re playing.  If your game is a
rollicking swashbuckler (like StarWars) then let them have lots of
firefights where the good guys never get more than a scratch.  If you game
is more realistic, then the only suggestion I can give you is kill \'em all!
;->

Seriously, kill them fast and bloody.  Then have them generate some more
characters and kill them too, and keep doing that until it dawns on them
that playing fast and loose with all that firepower just gets them killed. 


I like a good fight too, and love to toss them into games, but they tend
more toward unarmed bar room brawls than firefights with automatic weapons. 
Not that firefights don\'t erupt once in a while too.  ;-> However, they are
usually a consequence of the PC\'s having a major screwup, not something
they go out and seek.

Could it be that you\'re remembering the Octagon Society, the "first major 
distressed spacefarer assitance operation to appear in the Spinward 
Marches." I that is so, then TAS must have entered the Marches sometime 
after the establishment of the Octagon society in 342.

The Octagon society was dissolved in 499, and its assets sold at auction.

I am slightly offended by your attitude. Personally, I would never 
qualify my feelings with a statement like "If I were a woman," I don\'t 
pretend to think like a woman, but I do like to think that if something 
were abhorrantly offensive to a woman, I, too, would be just as offended.

I think if you feel strongly enough about the comparison, you *should* 
unsubscribe, or else refrain from hyperbole.

Gawd knows there\'s enough hyperbole on this list already...


BTW, I understand the point you\'re trying to make. I also understand the 
originator\'s analogy, and the point he was making. I\'m sure his intent 
was not to belittle the physical and emotional damage wrought by rape. I 
also understand that there was a goodly amount of hyperbole in his 
comparison.

Just last week I posted a short treatise on applying FUDGE task mechanics 
to Traveller, and my post was met with the internet equivalent of a 
"blank stare". Was everyone so disinterested, or was there nothing to 
debate about my post? :-)

FUDGE stands for "Freeform Universal Do-it-yourself Gaming Engine". It is 
a gaming system available for free on the Internet. I think it has lots 
of promise as a task-system replacement for Traveller. It requires only 4 
dice, virtually no pesky mathematics, a consistant difficulty progression 
(bell curve), as well as easy conversion to fit Traveller attributes. See 
<http://members.aol.com/ghostgames/> for more information about FUDGE.

This week I will be putting a slightly revised _FUDGEing Traveller_ 
document on my Jumpspace website, as well as the first steps to a 
FUDGE/Traveller combat system: a consistant, logarithmic range scale; 
from close personal combat, to interplanetary ranges.

   Traveller is not is a collection of paper and ink.  It evolved beyond
that point many years ago.  Traveller is bigger than any one individual
fan, GDW, IG or Marc Miller.  It will be around in some form for many
years to come, thanks to game stores that sell used gaming supplies, the
Internet (in fact, I for one believe that the Internet is the future of
RPGs, whether you want to talk document delivery or online sales),  but
mostly Traveller will be around because of collections of people like us
who refuse to let it die.

   That ultimately is the bottom line--the fan base.  Any bozo with a
milligram of business savvy can sell the world a pet rock.  But it takes
something extra to maintain a base of fans over the long haul.  At some
point in the past, GDW had that something, or we wouldn\'t be here now. 
So far, T4 has surpassed even MegaTraveller in terms of errata, and has
a storyline that is only about 75 percent consistent with previously
published materials.  IG has conducted a clinic in how not to run a
small RPG company, whether through the incompetence/naivete of its
employees, or because much of its associate staff is more
concerned/distracted by outside projects.  Nothing I\'ve seen indicates
to me that either T4 or IG will be around for the long haul.

   We\'ll still be here though.  And whether we speak ill or positively
of the T4 era or IG five years from now is all that\'s left to be
determined.

Harold

This situation could be The Seven Samurai (aka The Magnificent Seven) in reverse.  (I\'ve 
always wanted to run a Traveller adventure based on The Seven Samurai; maybe some 
Zhodani nobles trapped deep in Imperial territory after the war are engaged by a local 
community to help fend off raiders, but must swear not to use their psionic powers....

I\'m sorry, but the use of the term "rape" in whatever context in regard to
the products released by IG is only proof to me that the person in question
is taking this WAY too seriously. Invoking other definitions simply obscures
the issue. Anyone who thinks IG deliberatley wants to rip people off is, in
my opinion, not thinking.

Excellent point.

How\'s that for constructive input from the list?

This is a very good point, Eris--one that I noticed that but didn\'t

I agree, but I was talking more about characters coming out of T4 
chargen with a level 9 skill.  I think a level 4 or 5 would be more 
likely.

If you don\'t like the possible avenues that have been put forth for 
corrected data to reach the public (write ups in a couple of 
JTAS\'s--web page post), then how about a good, old fashioned, plain 
jane print out on 8.5x11 paper.

This should cost very little.  (1) Produce corrected FS data.  (2) 
Compile this data on 8.5x11 pieces of paper--an erratta sheet.  (3)  
Have this info available for any who send in a SASE.  (4)  Use the IG 
copier to photocopy sheets of paper that advertise the fact that 
these FS erratta sheets are available free to any who send to IG to 
get them, and place this sheet with every new product that IG 
produces for the rest of the year.  (5)  Complete the FS/M0 hardback 
with the new info.

Now, does that sound too costly for any company, no matter how small? 
 I mean, we\'re talking about producing a flyer on the office printer, 
going to kinko\'s (or whereever) and having this copied, then placing 
this flyer in all future product packages for a while to get the word 
out.

Customer pays postage with SASE.

We\'re talking cheap, cheap, cheap.

Why wouldn\'t that work?

Okay, I\'ve avoided making any comment for some very personal reasons.
However not only women get raped and sexually abused and one of the
reasons I play Traveller is to escape my \'unpleasant\' RL past. Please stop
this, it hurts.

Oh, shoot!  I\'m really, *really* sorry Glenn, I meant to reply to your
FUDGE posts.  

I know and use FUDGE.  Right now I\'m using some of the concepts from
FUDGE in 2 different PBEM\'s, one of which is Traveller.  At least, *I\'m*
calling it Traveller.  It doesn\'t use much of the T4 rule system or all
of the background.  So, *some* people might not consider it Traveller.
;->

I haven\'t complete gone over though, I have conversions so I can use a
Traveller style task system for somethings and the FUDGE style system
for others.  Right now I\'m *feeling* out where to apply each system. 
Frankly, I\'ve found I use the FUDGE side more and more.

Yes, it is a heretic\'s dream!  ;->

I\'ll have to stop by and grab a copy!  The conversion scales I use don\'t
match up completely with yours, but that\'s because I use a different
scale for the Traveller side of things.  

Here is a general "rule of thumb" scale I\'ve given to the players in my
games.  


                          ASSET      50/50 
  TASK LEVEL    D6     DESCRIPTION   TARGET
  ============================================
  1. AUTOMATIC    1d6-    TERRIBLE    2-3  
  2. SIMPLE       2d6     POOR        6-7  
  3. AVERAGE      3d6     MEDIOCRE     10  
  4. DIFFICULT    4d6     FAIR       13-14 
  5. FORMIDABLE   5d6     GOOD         17  
  6. STAGGERING   6d6     EXCELLENT  20-21 
  7. HOPELESS     7d6     SUPERB       24  
  8. IMPOSSIBLE   8d6+    LEGENDARY  27-28 


All the players *know* are the descriptions.  

The actual skill numbers are calculated with a 2 step process. First, I
calculate the Skill points using the formula:  

SP = (Attribute+Aptitude)*(Levels of experience) [Aptitude is 1d6]

Second I calculate the Skill Asset: SA = SP/5, dn

Target Numbers are the Skill Asset + some Attribute. 
 
Experience is gained by rolled 3d6 against the Skill Asset.  If the roll
is >= SA the character get\'s one point (SP).  It takes 5 SP to raise the
Skill Asset by one.

Maybe this is too complicated, I\'m still playing with it, but the game
play mainly uses the FUDGE descriptions so all the
complications and numbers stay well hidden.

And the descriptions the players have aren\'t always the ones *I* use for
the same skill, because they are just how good they *think* they are,
and as you probably know we aren\'t always the best judges of our own

I entirely disagree with the first part.  The greater number of skill
levels is one of the things I like *most* about T4 chargen. OTOH, I don\'t
think skill levels over 6 should be allowed.  If you can have a 10+ in
something it sort of devalues the experienced professional with a 3 or 4. 
Also, the T4 experience system is *badly* broken. 

First off, a 30-40 year old character should be at close to their peak in
skills. I don\'t think much advancement is needed.  One thing I like about
Traveller characters is that you are playing experienced professionals,
not inexperienced, 17 year-old yahoos who may someday achieve greatness
(yawn). 

Also, In T4 chargen, characters can *never* gain more than 2-3 skill
points a *year*.  This speed of advancement should be kept in play.  If
PCs can gain 8 -10 skill levels a year (or perhaps even more) in play,
then the previous experience system becomes nonsensical.  How about if
characters were limited to a maximum of 1 roll to gain or raise a skill
every 4 months?  This way, characters would advance at the same rate the
did during chargen, and they would not advance so fast that they would
become to powerful to play any time soon.

    'body' => 'Dr. Shaliin Ap, Dept. of Social Psychology, Imperial University of 
Sylea, in a public lecture, 045-0010:

The mingling of Solomani and Vilani cultures in the Second Imperium 
had some curious effects.  Terrans were quick to appreciate the 
Vilani shugilii and their associated customs, perhaps because of 
similarities to cooks and chefs on Old Earth.  The Vilani, although 
rather more conservative than their Solomani conquerors, came to 
adopt a number of Terran customs as their own.  Most widely accepted 
was the concept of Valentine\'s Day, held on 14 February (Terran) and 
now on Day 45 of the Imperial Calendar.

One of the difficulties in Vilani society at the time of the 
Ramshackle Empire was its rigidity; Vilani simply had difficulty in 
stepping outside the bounds of traditionally "proper" behaviour.  
This was in part an inheritance of the Ziru Sirka\'s culture, but was 
also a reaction to the frighteningly loose and direct culture of the 
Solomani.  At the same time, Solomani mores did strike a chord of 
horror mixed with admiration, especially among the younger and 
lower-class elements of Vilani society.

It was the inevitable mixing between young people which introduced 
Vilani to the idea of Valentine\'s Day as a day for declaring, um,
romantic feelings.  The stepping out of character was rather a 
thrill, but (crucially) stepping back into the Vilani cultural mould 
was also a relief.  Thus, Valentine\'s Day contributed not to the 
breakup of Vilani culture but instead to a gentle adaption of it, an 
adaption so successful that before the Long Night fell, it had spread 
to huge numbers of worlds throughout the Second Imperium.

This is only one example of the cultural integration which has made 
our own Imperium such a cosmopolitan inheritor of empire, but it is 
unusual for one reason in particular: it\'s possible to measure its 
spread rather accurately.  Obviously, the Long Night has played havoc 
with records, but Valentine\'s Day has a rather more tangiable image.

The symbol of the Terran festival was a stylised heart.  For some 
reason -- perhaps their relative disinterest in medical science and 
anatomy -- this did not appeal to the Vilani, who latched onto a 
secondary symbol, that of the rose.  This is a flower believed to be 
of Terran origin, and which was almost unobtainable at the time, and 
hence a rather tangiable symbol of affection, given its expense.  
Most people had to make do with the symbol of the rose.  I could give 
examples from the holovideo industry of how the rose became a symbol 
of romance... however, suffice it to say that roses and love became 
linked in the public imagination.

I suppose it was inevitable that some tidy-minded Vilani would wish 
for roses which grew quickly and lasted once cut.  It was equally 
inevitable that sooner or later a Solomani geneticist would produce 
one, the plant we know as Valentine\'s Rose.  Once the plant existed, 
it was certain that Vilani and Solomani alike would sell it wherever 
the market would bear.  This plant, therefore, is an indicator of the 
spread of Solomani influence in the Rule of Man.  Furthermore, 
mutation patterns can also be traced, giving us an idea of the 
patterns of distribution of the rose.

As you can see, the tiny plant which I placed at my left elbow at the 
start of this lecture is now quite a respectable bloom.  Tomorrow I 
shall give it to a certain geneticist of Solomani extraction.  I\'m 
sure many of you will be making similar gestures, though not to the 
same person I hope.  Please, when you do, think of the Imperium and 
how the rose has pulled us together.  Then you can go back to 
thinking about... other things.

Before I conclude, I should like to thank Dr. Felissa Jones of the 
Biotechnology department here at Imperial, our generous sponsors at 
the Office of Calendar Compliance, and of course yourselves for your 
attentive listening and generous applause.  I wish you all a happy 
Valentine\'s Day tomorrow, Twoday 45th of His Imperial Majesty\'s tenth 
year of goverment.  Long live the Emperor!

*   *   *   *

There are some obvious adventuring opportunities which arise from the 
existence of Valentine\'s Rose, which must be one of the most 
important cargoes to deliver on time the players can haul.  Fragile, 
too...

There may be a mutant strain which has a mildly aphrodisiac scent.

There may still be a market for the much rarer Terran rose, if any 
can be found.

There are two fairly easy ways out of this: The first one is to make the TAS
tickets non-refundable, i.e. they cannot be legally traded for money; that
can also spin off some short adventures involving criminals as the player
tries to "scalp" the tickets. The second is to keep the players moving, and
let them know that the ticket is planet to planet. It seems to have been
intended (though not explicitly stated) since the first version of this game
that the ticket would be good for 1 jump (or until the ship reached the next
available planet); otherwise, the cost of life support becomes more
expensive than the ticket.

No problem. He deserves credit for good thinking. Unless, again, shipping in
high-tech computers from off planet is ILLEGAL, especially without a
merchant\'s license. Also, those computers will need consumables - have you
ever tried using a data cassette or an 8-inch disk in your PC/Mac? People
can simply refuse to buy them because of the fact they can\'t get software or
hardware that interfaces. In addition, the merchants who run the free trader
will probably not be happy with someone going into their cargo bay and
removing small bits of cargo every trip; the alternative is that the
player\'s cabin is unsafely stacked with numerous boxes. The sale price of
the computers crashes, or someone else finds out about the player\'s scheme
and floods the market. Or, worst of all, they could pay him in local credits
- - these are (a) not accepted everywhere and (b) worth less than Imperial
credits.

As far as I know, this is a phase just about EVERY new Traveller player goes
through. The best answer (if you\'re willing to sacrifice a group of PC\'s) is
let \'em try. Low-tech doesn\'t mean stupid, cowardly, or even awestruck by
high technology. Most Imperial worlds have at least seen high-tech gear, and
they understand how to deal with it (take it away at customs, watch anyone
carrying around too much, etc...). Then they could call for aid from the
Imperial government; most nobles won\'t sit around waiting for the PC\'s to
\'storm the castle\' - they\'ll have a radio message offworld so fast it\'ll
make their heads swim. Then, as the PCs are relaxing in their ill-gotten
gains and feeling proud of themselves while wondering what happened to the
old baron, in storms a battalion or two of not-friendly-at-all Imperial
marines/army.

The important thing here is not to sell the enemy short - they won\'t make
stupid mistakes just because their culture is TL2. Under every set of rules
prior to T4, spears (TL0) could eventually get through battle dress (TL14).
If the players want a world where they will be comfortable, the differential
isn\'t going to be nearly that high, and so the danger will be...

"What you are experiencing is a temporary distortion of reality" - Fong.

You are experiencing a flashback to the Octagon Society. To quote the
Library Data in Twilight\'s Peak (adventure 3):

"Established in 342, the Octagon Society was the first major distressed
spacefarer assistance to appear in the Spinward Marches. The group thrived
on public contributions and some tax revenues for 150 years; it collapsed in
the late 400\'s when scandals emerged over quality of shelter construction
and the disposition of certain funds."

<snipped some out>

"The Octagon Society was dissolved in 499 and its assets were sold at auction."

Hope that helps...

Is this the same Allen Shock to whom I sent four GURPS books a couple
of years ago, believing (naively) that I would be sent some Traveller
products in return?  Didn\'t get a single email back after I sent the
stuff.  That was from his mother-in-law\'s email address, which was

If so, we have the opinion of an expert rip-off artist here, and I

Presenting (Loud Fanfaire),
Commander X and the Quest for the Holy Grai...wait thats not right!  Ok I\'ll 
come in again :)

Presenting (Loud Fanfaire),
Commander X and his Year 1100 to Year 0 UPP conversion rules.  (aka FS fix 
0.5beta)

Ok, first let me say that this will only convert the old CT or MT year 1100 
world to something that should represent the worlds as they are im Year 0. 
 If you want to use this to create your own FS sectors, go right ahead. 
 Personaly I am using them for the \'GM\'s Playgrounds\' of Zarushagar, Fornast 
and Delphi sectors, which will not have anything published by IG(so claims 
FS), but were published by GDW.

Ok, here we go, bear in mind that these are beta rules, I invite any 
comments or additions you may have.

First of all, we need to find the tech level, for all Ex RoM worlds(which is 
most of what the Imperium has gotten to by now) The TL cap is 13, if you 
want a higher tech world, thats your perogative.

Now that yor wolrds tech has been capped off, or left alone if not greater 
than 13, its time to degrade that tech lev.

If TL is 13-10 subtract 1d6
if TL is 9-7 subtract 1d3 (an actual good use of a 1/2 dice<G>)
if TL 6 or less, let it be.

Now use the TL reduction to degrade the starport.
if reduced by 1, dont worry about it
if reduced by 2, -1 Starport Code
if reduced by 3-4 -2 starport Codes
if reduced by 5-6 -3 Starport Codes

special note, personaly i dont like the idea of low tech societies(i.e. non 
stellar or non space fairing) w/o interstelar contact of having High level 
starports.  If you wish to use this rule here it is:

If the world is in the Imperial Sphere (i.e. claimed by the 3rd Imp, see my 
growth maps)
leave the starport as you have it now at this stage.

If the world has been contacted(i.e. within the merchant or scout contact 
areas), cap off the Starport using this chart

TL 8-7  Starport Max C
TL 6    Starport Max D
TL 5-  Starport Max E

If the world has not been contacted, reduce the Starport Caps by one level 
(D, E, X)

Again, if you want to make a world that has a higher level starport, go 
ahead, I would suggest it be part of a Pocket Empire tho.

Ok now to figure population, for those worlds that have reliable tech levels 
needed for surviving a harsh world, you dont need to worry about "maximum 
sustainable population"
Those TL are 7 and above for tainted atmos TL 9 and above for Exotic, 
Corrorsive and Insidious atmos.  If you have a world with these atmos and 
the TL has been reduced too far to possibly sustain life w/o the proper 
tech, nuke the world, make it X----000-0 Ba.

Find max sustainable population for TL 7 or less worlds using the same chart 
thats in TNE, its coppied here for those who dont have TNE:

Begin with code of A,
Size   1-4, -2pop  5-7, -1pop
Atmos   4, -2pop  5,7,9  -1pop
Hydro   0, -2pop  1,2,A  -1pop


This gives a Cap for population of a lower tech world, I figured higher 
techs could sustain more people, and TL 8 or 9 should be when somewhat 
reliable life support equipment is available.

Ok, now reduce the population to account for 1100 years of pop reduction, 
subtract the tech level reduction from the world population multipler. Dont 
forget to carry the one, that is if it goes beyond 0, take one away from the 
Population code and make a ten out of it for the pop multi.

interesting note, if population code is 5 or less, reduce the tech by one 
more point, if this would reduce the starport too, do it.

Ok the only thing left to do is fint the gov and law codes.  now that we 
have a new population, use that to find the gov and law as you would for a 
totaly new homegrown world.

Gov= population-7 + 2d6 (IIRC, I forget, thats what I get for using a 
program <G>)
Law=Gov-7 +2d6.

Another thing is to find Naval and Scout bases, I just delete the old data, 
and recalculate with the new degraded starport using the basic world 
building rules.

Class A or B 2d6 8+ for naval base.
I dont remember exacly what it was for Scout bases, these are IIRC values 
from memory:
On 2d6:
A  10+
B   8+
C  6+
D  4+

There you go.  How about some examples? OK

1100 data:  Shalishii  A584998-F  Im 310 G2V

step one cap the worlds tech  A584998-D
step 2, reduce the tech with 1d6, I get a 4:  A584998-9
step 3, reduce the starport, 4 reduces by 2 steps:  C584998-9
This world is in Imperial space (Vland sector) and its tech is high enough 
so no Starport cap.
This world also has a high enough tech, no need to cap the population(the 
cap would be 9 btw if TL was 7 due to size 5)
Now reduce the population multiplyer by 4 3-4 is -1, reduce the pop digit by 
one (to 8) and 10-1 makes the pop multi a 9

C584898-9 Im 910 G2V

Now we redo the gov and law, pop8-7 is 1 +2d6(roll a 7) gov is now an 8
Redo the Law 8-7 is 1 +2d6(rolled a 9) Law is A (ugh, they must have 
lightened up in 1100 years <g>)

Now do the bases with a starport of C, no chance for Naval, and i need a 
6(IIRC) for a scout, but to be safe, i say there is no scout base, the roll 
failed.

Now we have our downgraded world:

Year 0  Shalishii C58488A-9 Im 910 G2V
Year 1100 Shalishii A584998-F Im 310 G2V

There ye go!

AMEN BROTHER!!!

I too have grown weary of all this, that\'s why most of my game is home 
grown, has been since MT days.  I think that if I can inspire people to get 
together to build good ships (IBSA) and make some cool rules (Hackers and 
Year 1100 to year 0) that I could \'jumpstart\' or help the game along.  And I 
know now I am not alone.

I agree, if something is not done soon, this great work, this dream, this 
game Traveller, will exist only in the minds of its oldest players.  As I 
used to say during my TNE days...

KEEP THE FLAME!!!
The flame of Traveller alive!

Yeah, I know, I\'m a damned romantic! :)

 ----

Yes Kenneth, you are thinking on the right lines.  As SSDS is based on FF&S 
the ranges are indeed BL ranges.  At least that the way I figure it and use 
for my campain.

Also, the numbers for the sensors are the actual ranges in 30,000km hexes 
for the sensor package.  A3 P2 J0 would be Active range of 90,000km(short) 
and Passive range of 60,000km(short).

When I was making my X-Fighters, I had to basicaly discover/use this system 
to discover just what had been done, and create my own electronic package to 
fit inside a small fighter, as I could not find anything in SSDS about it.

Jason, wanna do the TML a big favor and post your "unofficial" system

would love to have this so I can do some mass-changing of UWPs.

This doesn\'t surprise me one bit. I think it\'s ridiculous to assume that

1) New players will buy a game so riddled with poor formatting (courier
fonts, bad production values), mediocre and non-Travelleresque art, and
broken rules when in a market that\'s already depressed there are so many
other choices available.

2) Old players will buy a game that breaks canon at will (Fusion Plus) and
doesn\'t make a wholehearted attempt at satisfying either the TNE fans or
the CT fans who make up Traveller\'s core market.

3) The game\'s foundation is a set of 20-year-old rules. You don\'t have to
make the game as complex as TNE (which, BTW I think is the best set of
mechanics for Trav), but you do have to make it complex and realistic
enough that it doesn\'t insult the players\' intelligences. Also, PUH-LEAZE
playtest these things instead of just making them up and publishing them!
You cannot tell me that task system was playtested appropriately before
publication!

I\'m afraid Traveller, as we know it, may be doomed. I only hope someone
picks up the flag.

Best,

I never got that impression at all. All the posts complaining about
non-Traveller canon specifically mentioned rules published by IG. I don\'t
recall anyone saying what individual players should be allowed to do. In
fact, every Traveller referee is a heretic; the rules and background have
changed so many times that practically any ruling one makes will contradict
something once published.

No one ever made such an absurd claim. Really, this is a complete straw
man; the complaint was exclusively about IG\'s own books, not about the
people playing the game. The complaint is that IG publishes rules and
histories that contradict themselves. Now I have no complaint about
referees changing the rules themselves, I do it myself. I do have a
complaint when IG publishes books which state a TL 7 planet with a total
population of 100 fought the Sylean Federation to a standstill for over a
century and took several Sylean worlds. I have a complaint when IG
publishes books which state a comparatively tiny and inefficient
intestellar empire whose strategic advantage was Jump 3 but was not able to
hold a larger empire was nonetheless able to achieve TL 15 technology. I
have a complaint when IG publishes adventures with cloaking devices and FTL
radio. I have a complaint when IG publishes rules which make it unlikely a
starship would survive a single term. I have a complaint when IG publishes
books with starship components whose prices differ by an order of magnitude.

I do a lot of things in my campaign which aren\'t in the rule books. All I
ask is that when IG publishes a book it do enough background checks to
ensure I don\'t have to do significant damage control to use it. No one is
forcing anyone to use the rules as published. I would just like it to be
*possible* to use the rules as published.

What burns me is how simple it would have been to fix these problems if IG
had just bothered to actually proofread this stuff before publishing. It
would have been trivial to make Keshi a TL 12 high-population industrial
world. It would have been simple to make the TL 14 artifacts discoveries
from some unknown but contemporary civilization. It would have been easier
to reuse the MT misjump rules instead of creating new ones that make
interstellar commerce impossible. They could propose alternate game
universes with FTL radio using the Traveller rules. Instead, IG just
publishes without even bothering to check for consistency and then ignores
customers who complain. This, I have a complaint with.

	Here\'s why. You didn\'t specify wether the errate would just contain new 
LLs, or would contain entire UPPs, but both are disasters.

	Having a list of LLs completely separate from the rest of the UPP is such 
a monumental PITA I don\'t even want to think about it. Every single time 
you want to look up a world, you have to first look it up in FS, and then 
look up the LL on a cryptic errate sheet. I DON\'T WANT TO DO THIS!

	Printing out the entire UPPs would bankrupt IG. That would mean printing 
out the ENTIRE FS book free of charge. In the past few weeks, as Campaign 
Manager for a local Reform Party candidate in the Canadian election, I\'ve 
had a crash course in printing economics. You have no idea how expensive it 
is - and we were just printing a 1 page brochure.

        Apply ULTRA-REALISM: Kill one PC for each dead NPC, on average,
unless the combat has been so well-planned that they\'ve spent half a session
role-playing before it. Even one PC per 4 NPCs may work.

        A suggestion: Use the gimmick idea. Let them know there are some
REAL POWERFUL GUNS out there. VRF Portable Gauss Machineguns, Plasma
Machineguns, TL17-21 weapons, whatever. Just let them know, throw some
clues. Let them dream. And then, let them wander two dozen planets and burn
their neurons to figure out where those wonderful weapons are... let\'s them
make a lot of research and travel to find their desired weapons... Put some
powerful enemies after the same weapons, and let things grow more and mroe
dangerous. Kill half the PCs on the last adventure. And let them pick one of
the wonderful weapons, but with a caveat: ammunition is special and cannot
be produced below TL17, so they can only use it half a dozen of times. Or,
the TL21 badly damaged weapon has a 1/6 probability of doing very nasty
things with the PC every time it\'s used. Or, the weapon is so spectacular
that every time they use it without VERY careful planning, word spreads out
and the REALLY POWERFUL organization that also seeks the weapons starts
chasing them around. Let them worry a lot to maintain their gimmick.
        Your PCs will be more and more time thinking and planning, even if

  imprint), there was an article with adventure hooks that
  involved virally-induced porphyria, which, among its other
  symptoms, caused recession of the gums and a craving for
  iron-rich substances - most notably, human blood.

  The fascination with the legend of the Vampire is noted.

  In a different old JTAS (GDW), there was an article about a
  world (interestingly, named Porphyry) where the ruling class
  suffered from a rare hereditary form of anemia, and all
  citizens were required to donate blood to help the rulers
  survive.

  The fascination continues - with a twist.

  Just a few days ago (probably last Tuesday), in the NYTimes,
  there was an article about a rare disease called XERODERMA
  PIGMENTOSUM.  The most notable characteristic of this disease
  is that even miniscule amounts of exposure to UV can cause
  severe burns and skin cancer - the particular case that was
  the "centerpiece" or "impact study" for the article exhibited
  such reactions as bubbling skin on exposure to the sun, or
  even to many fluorescent lights.  The parents of this little
  girl have created a summer camp for afflicted children that
  operates on a "reversed" clock - work, play, and so on at
  night; sleep during the day.

  Should I continue the fascination with a different twist?
  Would the list be receptive to an adventure on this theme?

        Wasn\'t the new/old Milieu Zero Campaign going to include maps for
the expanding Imperium between year -30 and year 200?

        Maps of known space are a must for the Basic Rulebook, but they are
also a must for all background-oriented supplements. This was also an
important failure of M0. I really loved the abundance of maps in MT and the
graphical explanation of the fall of the Imperium in Rebellion Sourcebook /
Hard Times. I think M0 should have something similar... and, in fact, IIRC,
Jo Grant posted some time ago the ASCII version of such maps.

Allen, First, If you were a woman, I might apologize to you, but since you
are not, I wont.  I am not insensitive to the seriousness of rape.  Do me a
favor, though, study a littly about analogy.  If you are interested, eMail
me and I will explain to you the two ways you have misinterpreted the
analogy I used.  I can see how easily they would lead to your being offended.

Just a side note, here.  I have never been raped.  I make no attempts to
pretend to understand the emotional scarring that occurs when someone is
raped.  That was not ever the basis for my analogy.

>Allen

Two questions here, Allen:

1.  If definitions obscure issues, why do we even bother having them?
2.  Where did I say that IG was deliberately trying to rip me off?

You may want to re-read my post.  I use a bit of sarcasm, but I never said
that IG is deliberately trying to rip people off.  If you will re-read my
post paying close attention to the facts I present, you will see that I was
thinking. Traveller has been a part of my life for quite some time, and I
wouldn\'t ditch it without some serious thinking.

Andrew, I apologize for having offended you.  As I asid before, I make no
attempts to pretend to understand the serious emotional side of rape.  I do
hope that you will accept my apology.  Also, as I said above, this will be
my last post on this.  I am also sorry for hurting you with anything I said,
as you can probably tell by now, that was never my intention.  If you would
let me, pleas eMail me privately and let me know how I can make it up to you.


I don\'t have the digests from the past few days, but I do remember a few
notes that I wanted to comment on.

To those who agreed with me and said so, thank you.  To those who have
defended what I said, thank you.  I will ask that everyone, offended and
supporters drop this off the list.  I will gladly correspond with anyone
privately about this, but it went beyond where I started it, and it is no
longer appropriate for the list.  I\'ll say it one last time, what I wrote
was commentary, if you don\'t like it, eMail me privately.  If you do, eMail
me privately, but...

DROP IT FROM THE LIST, IT HAS GROWN BEYOND COMMENTARY AND IT NEEDS TO GO OFF
LIST.

Now, one last thing...

Eamon, Yes, I have sold everything except one TNE main book and my T4 soft
cover.  Those two were too worn and tattered for me to sell with a good
conscience.  Lewis is now the keeper of the BARD Pages, and I will be a

Trav.  There are actualy many good things about trav IMNSHO.

1. Versitility.
Traveller was originaly designed to be versitile.  That is you could create 
any setting, any genre, anything!  Your universe was your universe.  I 
enjoyed making my own worlds and detailing them.  I never had any of the 
other sectors except the Marches until I got on the net.  Seeing what else 
was out there intreaged me tho so I got them.  Still most of the worlds I 
detailed myself.  When FF&S came out, that added a new level of versitility. 
 Now I could create technologies for my universe or adapt the curent stuff. 
 This game was very versitile in all its incarnations.

2. The Thrill of the Unknown.
The game had all these worlds, all these sectors, and the way we played was 
that the GM would make a world as we got to that area of space.  Nobody not 
even the GM knew what we would find there.  Then the bit about grandfather 
and the ancients came out, more mystery, more unknown and forgoten civs and 
techs.  In a recent and prolly the only game I have played in T4(mostly GM 
at home), I\'m not saying which one but my fellow crewmates know what I mean, 
the adventure is all that and more.  Mystery after Mystery!

3. The Commraderie
This game has been around for a long time, 2 posibly 3 generations of gamers 
know about it and/or play on a regular basis.  that is a large family of 
fellow enthusiasts.  where else can people sit down and discuss how to build 
a ship, or an Empire?  Back when Marc created the game there was no 
internet, he had no idea that the community of gamers could be so huge 
untill a small fraction of them connected in the "etherial void".  No where 
else have I meet such good friends which have a common interest.  Even 
though I have never met them personaly, I still consider them part of the 
"Traveller Family"

Ghods!  there I go being romantic again!
Can\'t help it, I\'m a noble, and speeches are our thang! :)

Let\'s not forget that men can be raped, too. Yes, statistically, they\'re a
small fraction of those who suffer from this abhorrent crime, but it does
happen, particularly in prison.

The term "rape" is often used as a metaphor for being grossly mistreated.
While somewhat too blunt a metaphor for my taste, it\'s usage is common
enough that I don\'t think it\'s worth getting too riled about.

Best,

Everytime I find that the TML majority is right.

I\'ve only bought the first book so far. My campaign is late in the MT era and
neither I nor my players want to switch settings so certain books have no use
for me. I\'ll probably pick up EA and CSC. They\'re the best books so far and
they\'re not setting specific. I tend to focus on out-of-print stuff. I
participated in Paul\'s auction and won V&V. Yes, it was a sight unseen
purchase but since I\'d heard nothing but praise about it I figured it would
be a safe buy.... and it was! =)

Product investigation prior to purchase would appear to be the only prudent
course of action until the IG track record becomes consistent.

You misunderstood what I said, and I think we are in agreement.

I like a character coming out of chargen with multiple skills, but, 
like what you have just stated above, I don\'t want character\'s 
comining out with any one of those skills at level 9 or greater.  In 
fact, I think you should rarely see a level 5 come out of chargen.

BUT,  a character with several, different skills (all with their 
skill level ranging from 1 to, say, 4-5) is something I do like about 
T4 chargen.

In CT, I always felt that the skill levels were appropriate, but 
characters came out of chargen with too few total skills.

Then Book 4:  Mercenary came along and introduced the one-year 
chargen method (where you roll each year).  I think this is also 
referred to as advanced chargen.

I thought that this created characters with a good mix between 
multiple skills while keeping a lid on the levels to those skills.

MT copied both these methods in the MTPM.  The usual 4-year method 
was used in the first part of the book, and characters came out too 
weak skill wise.  In the latter of the book, advanced chargen options 
were available for certain character classes.

The great thing about T4 chargen is that it produces 
characters--created with the 4-year method--that are on par with 
characters created with the one year advanced method.

Giving a character a skill for every year in T4 vs giving him one for 
every 4 years, as in CT, was a stroke of genius.

But, it works a little too good.  There needs to be some sort of 
control imposed.

I, personally, would like to see a roll applied each year to see if 
the character gets a skill that year.  This roll would be pretty easy 
to achieve success in, and I picture it akin to the skill roll in the 
CT/MT one-year advanced chargen systems.

Players would make this roll most of the time, but when they didn\'t, 
this would cut down on the skill levels awarded.

I also like Eris\' comment that the skill lists used in chargen be 
expanded so that more skills are available, and the same skill does 
not keep poping up for the character.


> Also, In T4 chargen, characters can *never* gain more than 2-3 skill
> points a *year*.

I agree with this too.  See my comments on the experience system.  I 
said that the experience system should limit a character to advancing 
in skills and levels to about the same as he would in chargen.

2-3 skill points per year is fine with me, but this should only be 
allowed for a year of heavy adventuring where the character is 
exposed to much more experience than a normal professional just doing 
his job (who would probably only get one skill level in that year).

Now, here\'s a great comment.  Let\'s just fix the damn thing 
ourselves.

Talk about no expense for IG!

What is left for IG to do?  See my other post on this where I suggest 
that the errata be printed with the office printer, copied on the 
office copier, and be available to anyone who sends in an SASE.

And, they\'ll need to make a flyer (again on the office printer using 
the office copier) to place in the other products coming out this 
year to advertise that errata is available for FS.

If the TML is willing to get behind this idea and work at getting 
"perfect" FS data, I can\'t see a reason why IG would turn it down.

We\'re talking virtually no expense!

Michael, I think you should take the ball and run with it.  The TML 
should get organized about this.  

Let\'s have team leaders in charge of a sector.  One person will be 
responsible for one subsector.  Michael is the overall project leader 
who will collect the data and coordinate the project.

I think first, we should make a list of all the important stuff that 
needs to be addressed--Vland\'s population and whatever else.

We should compare the data to the 1100 "official" data from DGP and 
whatever other sources are available to make sure the M0 data makes 
sense when compared to the 1100.

Somebody has suggested using the TNE rules for the deterioration of a 
planet\'s stats.  That might be a good idea.

When we get done, we have the list proof read this data with a fine 
tooth comb, and when we are absolutely sure we have created exactly 
what we want, we send it to IG with an "our compliments" tag.

Let\'s not just fix the big boo boos in FS--let\'s fix the the damn 
data.  Let\'s make sure that we are not going to find another problem 
later.

And, let\'s keep a handle on getting too "fix-crazy".  If the star 
system only needs its law level and government code change--otherwise 
the data entry is fine, let\'s just fix those two stats and move on.

We don\'t need to generate new data for the whole book--just police 
the data that\'s there.

I volunteer to be one of the sector leaders, to coordinate activities 
in one sector, and to work on one of the subsectors (in whatever 
sector I am assigned)  myself.

Who else is going to get behind this project?

Kenneth.

PS  I guess somebody should go to IG (or Marc) first to see if they 
will use the data that we generate and fix.  I don\'t see why we 
should go to all this trouble first--only to find that IG won\'t use 
it.

Michael may want to be the person that approaches IG on this, but if 
not, I can take care of it if I have the support of the rest of the 
list.

From the replies, I\'m actually surprised that this is a problem in so 
many games.  As a member of the TAS, a character is allowed one High 
Passage every two months.  This can usually be sold for 90% of its 
face value--Cr9,000.  That\'s only Cr4,500 for the character per 
month.

Is an additional Cr4,500 for a character per month that much of a 
game unballanceer?   I don\'t really think so, and this has never been 
a problem in my game.

You can make it easy on the character by allowing him to be able to 
cash in the HP right there at the TAS when he receives his passage.

TAS clerk:  "You are due for your high passage sir."

PC:  "Ah, thanks.  Listen, could I have that in cash?"

TAS clerk:  "Yes sir.  There\'s the standard 10% handling fee that 
applies.  Here\'s your 9000 credits.  Would you like cash, or would 
you like me to update your creditchit?"

But, if you think that the extra Cr4,500 is hurting your game, you 
can get a little harder on how the character obtains this money.

Here\'s how I handle it in my game.

First off, the characters need to go to a TAS office to receive the 
HP.  Those are located at class A and B starports.  If the characters 
don\'t happen to be on a world with a class A or B starport, then they 
are just going to have to wait until they get to one.

We\'re playing in the Aramis subsector of the Spinward Marches right 
now, and there are only 10 TAS offices in the entire subsector (class 
A or B starports).  They are spread out through the subsector, but 
there are definite areas that the players can go that makes obtaining 
the HP highly inconvienent.

Next, when my players get to the TAS offices, they receive their HPs 
(and any do them), but the TAS office does not cash them in like in 
the example I cited above. 

I figure that the TAS does not loose money on dispensing all those 
HPs to all it\'s members every other month.  They probably get them 
(or print them) for next to nothing, or trade them for some other 
service they perform.  Either way, I can see the TAS going out of 
business real quick if it gave Cr4,500 per month to all of its 
members--I don\'t care if it is MCr1 to get in the place.

(I also don\'t think that when some characters get the membership 
during chargen--say a Naval character, that the Navy actually pays 
MCr1 to get the character in.  I think that the fee is waved by the 
TAS by special arrangement for whatever reason with the Navy--I don\'t 
know, maybe the TAS allots so many memberships to various services 
each year for political reasons.)

So, since the character cannot immediately cash in the HP, that\'s 
exactly what he\'s got--a piece of paper allowing transport.

Many times this is useless to the character, and he wants to cash it 
in.  In my game, he needs to find a buyer to do this.

The standard rate is Cr9,000 for a high passage, but sometimes a 
character has to take what he can get--depending on how many buyers 
he finds and how bad they need it.  He might even get more for it.

This leads to all sorts of role playing situations, and I\'ve even 
implemented patrons, rumors, and adventures through this interaction.

So, you see, the HP does not need to be a burden to you as a GM.  Get 
creative and make it work for you.

Gotcha.  Does a person have to have seen BL to figure this out in 
Starships, or did I miss something in the text?

(If I didn\'t miss anything, I think IG should put in some 
clarification when they re-publish Starships.)

Now, here\'s something I didn\'t know, and I\'m really glad you told me.

Looks like there is something else that should go in the revised 
edition of Starships--a little clarification.

Thanks, Bill,

I would guess that millimeter wave radar and a central navigation
information network which fed the onboard computers of all craft and
provided required small course changes would do the trick.

I\'ve also always liked the idea that a sufficiently powerful hacker, or
the government, could arrange \'tragic speeder accidents\' ona  regular
basis.

Other possibilities; Specific lanes of operation and altitudes for your
direction of travel and class of vehicle, safety zones around buildings
and towers, underground tubeways for grave traffic [oops, I mean
grav...was that an interesting typo or what...I\'ll just leave it in.]    

In any case, I would usually assume computer controlled flight, and almost
require at least computer augmented/assisted flight.

By the way, Do people have an image of what most grav vehicles look like?
I would think the standard vehicle looks an awful lot like a Pontiac
transsport (without wheels, of course).  However, there have been grav
porches in campaigns I\'ve run.

Just a clarification:  Joe Walsh posted the ascii maps.  The maps

The best example of ways to control this type of situation are:
  The primitive society determines that the "visitors" are actually
 like them --  they bleed and die.  Cf: the book by Rudyard Kipling,
 _The Man Who Would be King_, also an excellent movie starring
 Sean Connery and Michael Caine.

Have an Imperial Edict that requires all trade to take place at no 
more than two tech levels above the world\'s current tech level.

Use customs agents to control the flow of tech level goods.

Begin to have the PCs become protectors of "their worlds" and find out
what it is like to maintain a fief-dom.  Yeah, make them _minor_ nobles 
with temporary titles that last only a year or two.  They have to visit 
each planet in their fiefdom at least once a year for at least two weeks.  
This can really tie them down and make them really appreciate their subjects.  
Of course if the become much like King John of England, the peasants could 
always revolt.  Fuzzy Wuzzie or Zulu syndrome strikes.

What?  You are making me laugh.

I\'m picturing something like the Spinward Marches data in the back of 
the MT Imperial Encyclopedia.  The whole sector information is 
complete with hex #, UPP, Bases, Remarks, Data, and Star info--and 
all of this is done, two column, in 3 pages!

Print on the back of 1 page, and you get an entire sector in 2 pages.

What I\'m talking about is generating correct FS data and entering it 
(by hand if you have to--a big job, but nothing that couldn\'t be 
done.) into a word processing or spreadsheet program there at the IG 
office.

Then, you print out one original copy and take it to some place like 
Kinko\'s or Office Depot.  I called, you can get 500 copies for $30.  
That\'s a printed--not copied, one sided 8.5 x 11 sheet for 6 cents a 
page.

Let\'s do the math:  There are 18 sectors in FS.  At 3 sheets per 
sector, each erratta packet would cost IG $3.24.  If we print on the 
back, our cost is reduced to $2.16 per packet.

With the quantity that IG will need (and if they go with a copy 
instead of a printed piece), they could cut the cost in half.

So, what you are talking about, in terms of cost to IG, is about $1 
per erratta packet.

And, I\'ll tell ya what.  If they do this, I\'ll even send them a buck 
to get the erratta sheet.

Now, come on.  IG can do this.  If this is going to break them, then 
they are too far down the hole anyway.

The Fifth Element seems to be a good-looking woman wearing bits of adhesive

I always used 80%, which means that the six passages they receive a year is
going to be something like 48KCr a year.  With your 90% rule, they would
get 54KCr/year.

This is very high living.  In a post a few months ago, I tried to work out
reasonable income levels for TL12 Sylea, or where ever the expenses for
food and lodging were determined, and got an average PCGPP of between 8KCr
and 15KCr.  If you wish, I can repost or send it to you directly.

This fit well with a 20 year pension being 10KCr, as this put pensioners in
middle or lower middle class on Sylea, and pretty high on the hog on a low
tech world outside.

Note that starship crews are very overpaid, as a good pilot can bring in
60KCr, well above the top tenth of a percent, assuming an income
distribution anywhere near the present day.

As Kevin points out, it is easy enough to get the character involved - most
people would want to take those high passages if they can.  I rule that TAS
actually is very good at finding two month "jobs" for travellers, like
guest lecturer at TAS, which covers food and lodging, and expedition scout,
so that TAS members always have lots of interesting times to talk about to
other TAS members.  This is why people fork over the million credits or so
to join, and why members are very protective of TAS.

In my games, being a TAS member is considered only just one step shy of
being noble, and it is not clear which side of the line it is on.  Of
course, that is because all of my players are explorer types, not stay at
homes.  TAS is structtured to make people better explorers, and more
cosmopolitan.  HEarkening back to the Templar thread, I have wondered if it
was not TAS that ended up dictating the structure of the eventual Imperium.

I, as well, would be willing to pay a few bucks for fixed data, or a few
bucks as part of my JTAS subscription.  I even am willing to toss in the
extra dollar for mailing (big of me, no?).  I would be happier to get the
data in machine form on the web site, perhaps with a password on a zip or
stuffit file.

Of course, I would like the data in machine form REGARDLESS of whether they
fix it.

The key is that it is not that expensive to fix the data, as long as they
can still turn a profit on the original idea.  They should make money on
this data for all new purchasers of FS, I just think those of use who have
the old copy should not have to pay more than cost, and cost is pretty low
when you do not have to lay out a book.

But then, I also think the data is flawed, and needs work.  If they do not
agree with that fundamental idea, then we are going to disagree on the kind
of fix needed.

        I\'ve already done some work into the suggested direction (to correct
FS) for Massilia sector. I posted the preliminary results some time ago.
Hereby, I volunteer to be "Massilia Sector Corrector", coordinator, or
whatever. I offer to work myself on the whole sector at a slow pace, or on
two subsectors at a quick one: Shiwonee and Shokee (the Geonee subsectors,
of course...)

I\'m afraid it\'s true; I got my letter yesterday :-(.  Arcane was the first
pro-magazine that I had subscribed too since... well, since White Dwarf was
good (am I showing my age now ;-)).

I think I\'m correct in saying that Valkyrie is the only UK pro magazine

Tales of the Reaching Moon, and The Unspeakable Oath, (and JTAS if I read
more favourable reviews).

Well, heck, I devote not a little of my spare time to *teaching* Thelemic
Magick (with a \'k\', just to throw off spell checkers -- pun intentional). 
But in a discussion of SF, \'magic\' is often used to denote the soft end of
the scale.  Needless to say, everything is both relative and a matter of
opinion; but I would rate (say) Clarke and Varley and Niven/Pournelle at
the \'hard\' end of the spectrum, with perhaps McCaffrey and Bradbury at the
\'soft\' end.  I am willing to call Traveller \'hard SF\' if its degree of
hand-waving and internal consistency do not exceed those of the hard-SF
authors I cite above.

Again, Isp is in *seconds*.  Also, my *exhaust velocity* below was 300
km/s, or 0.001c -- but close enough.  700 km/s was the ship\'s final
velocity after burning all its fuel.

Sigh.  Yes, it\'s completely true, the power levels required for Trav ships
to maneuver per canon are entirely broken, utterly magical, completely out
of touch with reality if one holds to canonical power supply types and
outputs.

Almost makes me want to take a stab at explaining both low-power
high-accel drives *and* CG lifters in terms of "Doc" Smith\'s inertialess
drives.  Instead of removing *all* inertia, have it remove all but about
1%, and do the same for effective gravitational mass.  Voila, in one
stroke you\'ve explained CG and made maneuver drive power levels more
reasonable.  Ghod only knows what you\'ve broken in the process, of
course...

So in your worldview no SF containing FTL travel can qualify as \'hard\'?
Not criticizing!!  Just trying to pin down terminology.

Trav isn\'t \'hard\' in the absolute sense; I merely think it\'s harder than
most/all of the other SF RPGs ever produced, and hence must qualify as
\'hard\' in a relative sense.

Every reference I can find defines Isp as having units of seconds; one
defines it as the number of seconds one pound of propellant can produce
one pound of thrust (gotta love those English units).  A better expression
would be:

   Isp = Thrust / (1G * Fuel mass consumption rate)

LOX/H2 has an Isp of around 800 sec; apparently HEPlaR drives run around 4
*million* seconds.  This is clearly one of those circumstances where one
needs a heavy construction crane to suspend one\'s disbelief. :)

I never got that impression at all. All the posts complaining about
non-Traveller canon specifically mentioned rules published by IG. I don\'t
recall anyone saying what individual players should be allowed to do. In
fact, every Traveller referee is a heretic; the rules and background have
changed so many times that practically any ruling one makes will contradict
something once published.

No one ever made such an absurd claim. Really, this is a complete straw
man; the complaint was exclusively about IG\'s own books, not about the
people playing the game. The complaint is that IG publishes rules and
histories that contradict themselves. Now I have no complaint about
referees changing the rules themselves, I do it myself. I do have a
complaint when IG publishes books which state a TL 7 planet with a total
population of 100 fought the Sylean Federation to a standstill for over a
century and took several Sylean worlds. I have a complaint when IG
publishes books which state a comparatively tiny and inefficient
intestellar empire whose strategic advantage was Jump 3 but was not able to
hold a larger empire was nonetheless able to achieve TL 15 technology. I
have a complaint when IG publishes adventures with cloaking devices and FTL
radio. I have a complaint when IG publishes rules which make it unlikely a
starship would survive a single term. I have a complaint when IG publishes
books with starship components whose prices differ by an order of magnitude.

I do a lot of things in my campaign which aren\'t in the rule books. All I
ask is that when IG publishes a book it do enough background checks to
ensure I don\'t have to do significant damage control to use it. No one is
forcing anyone to use the rules as published. I would just like it to be
*possible* to use the rules as published.

What burns me is how simple it would have been to fix these problems if IG
had just bothered to actually proofread this stuff before publishing. It
would have been trivial to make Keshi a TL 12 high-population industrial
world. It would have been simple to make the TL 14 artifacts discoveries
from some unknown but contemporary civilization. It would have been easier
to reuse the MT misjump rules instead of creating new ones that make
interstellar commerce impossible. They could propose alternate game
universes with FTL radio using the Traveller rules. Instead, IG just
publishes without even bothering to check for consistency and then ignores
customers who complain. This, I have a complaint with.

	Here\'s why. You didn\'t specify wether the errate would just contain new 
LLs, or would contain entire UPPs, but both are disasters.

	Having a list of LLs completely separate from the rest of the UPP is such 
a monumental PITA I don\'t even want to think about it. Every single time 
you want to look up a world, you have to first look it up in FS, and then 
look up the LL on a cryptic errate sheet. I DON\'T WANT TO DO THIS!

	Printing out the entire UPPs would bankrupt IG. That would mean printing 
out the ENTIRE FS book free of charge. In the past few weeks, as Campaign 
Manager for a local Reform Party candidate in the Canadian election, I\'ve 
had a crash course in printing economics. You have no idea how expensive it 
is - and we were just printing a 1 page brochure.

        Apply ULTRA-REALISM: Kill one PC for each dead NPC, on average,
unless the combat has been so well-planned that they\'ve spent half a session
role-playing before it. Even one PC per 4 NPCs may work.

        A suggestion: Use the gimmick idea. Let them know there are some
REAL POWERFUL GUNS out there. VRF Portable Gauss Machineguns, Plasma
Machineguns, TL17-21 weapons, whatever. Just let them know, throw some
clues. Let them dream. And then, let them wander two dozen planets and burn
their neurons to figure out where those wonderful weapons are... let\'s them
make a lot of research and travel to find their desired weapons... Put some
powerful enemies after the same weapons, and let things grow more and mroe
dangerous. Kill half the PCs on the last adventure. And let them pick one of
the wonderful weapons, but with a caveat: ammunition is special and cannot
be produced below TL17, so they can only use it half a dozen of times. Or,
the TL21 badly damaged weapon has a 1/6 probability of doing very nasty
things with the PC every time it\'s used. Or, the weapon is so spectacular
that every time they use it without VERY careful planning, word spreads out
and the REALLY POWERFUL organization that also seeks the weapons starts
chasing them around. Let them worry a lot to maintain their gimmick.
        Your PCs will be more and more time thinking and planning, even if
one of their main concerns is still how to use hi-tech weapons.

Subject: Hmmmm....

  In an old Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society (GDW
  imprint), there was an article with adventure hooks that
  involved virally-induced porphyria, which, among its other
  symptoms, caused recession of the gums and a craving for
  iron-rich substances - most notably, human blood.

  The fascination with the legend of the Vampire is noted.

  In a different old JTAS (GDW), there was an article about a
  world (interestingly, named Porphyry) where the ruling class
  suffered from a rare hereditary form of anemia, and all
  citizens were required to donate blood to help the rulers
  survive.

  The fascination continues - with a twist.

  Just a few days ago (probably last Tuesday), in the NYTimes,
  there was an article about a rare disease called XERODERMA
  PIGMENTOSUM.  The most notable characteristic of this disease
  is that even miniscule amounts of exposure to UV can cause
  severe burns and skin cancer - the particular case that was
  the "centerpiece" or "impact study" for the article exhibited
  such reactions as bubbling skin on exposure to the sun, or
  even to many fluorescent lights.  The parents of this little
  girl have created a summer camp for afflicted children that

        Wasn\'t the new/old Milieu Zero Campaign going to include maps for
the expanding Imperium between year -30 and year 200?

        Maps of known space are a must for the Basic Rulebook, but they are
also a must for all background-oriented supplements. This was also an
important failure of M0. I really loved the abundance of maps in MT and the
graphical explanation of the fall of the Imperium in Rebellion Sourcebook /
Hard Times. I think M0 should have something similar... and, in fact, IIRC,
Jo Grant posted some time ago the ASCII version of such maps.

Well, it seems that my comments have evoked deep emotions within people.
Both for and against my position.  It seems that my comments were read into
a little too deeply by some, and, it seems, I have offended some.

I just deleted something of an explanation and comments because I really
don\'t think that it is appropriate to the discussion on the list.  What I
have posted to the list was merely an expression of the way I felt by the
treatment I got from IG, a commentary if you will.

I do not in any way apologize for the way I feel.  I will gladly apologize
for offending anyone with what I said.  The way I feel will not change, nor
will what I have said change.

This will be my last post to the list on this matter.  Feel free to belittle

for what I have done, but it will not change the way I feel.

Allen, First, If you were a woman, I might apologize to you, but since you
are not, I wont.  I am not insensitive to the seriousness of rape.  Do me a
favor, though, study a littly about analogy.  If you are interested, eMail
me and I will explain to you the two ways you have misinterpreted the
analogy I used.  I can see how easily they would lead to your being offended.

Just a side note, here.  I have never been raped.  I make no attempts to
pretend to understand the emotional scarring that occurs when someone is
raped.  That was not ever the basis for my analogy.

Two questions here, Allen:

1.  If definitions obscure issues, why do we even bother having them?
2.  Where did I say that IG was deliberately trying to rip me off?

You may want to re-read my post.  I use a bit of sarcasm, but I never said
that IG is deliberately trying to rip people off.  If you will re-read my
post paying close attention to the facts I present, you will see that I was
thinking. Traveller has been a part of my life for quite some time, and I
wouldn\'t ditch it without some serious thinking.

Andrew, I apologize for having offended you.  As I asid before, I make no
attempts to pretend to understand the serious emotional side of rape.  I do
hope that you will accept my apology.  Also, as I said above, this will be
my last post on this.  I am also sorry for hurting you with anything I said,
as you can probably tell by now, that was never my intention.  If you would
let me, pleas eMail me privately and let me know how I can make it up to you.

To those who agreed with me and said so, thank you.  To those who have

DROP IT FROM THE LIST, IT HAS GROWN BEYOND COMMENTARY AND IT NEEDS TO GO OFF

Subject: Why I like Traveller & T4

Someone , Ken I believe, mentioned something about saying good things about 
Trav.  There are actualy many good things about trav IMNSHO.

1. Versitility.
Traveller was originaly designed to be versitile.  That is you could create 
any setting, any genre, anything!  Your universe was your universe.  I 
enjoyed making my own worlds and detailing them.  I never had any of the 
other sectors except the Marches until I got on the net.  Seeing what else 
was out there intreaged me tho so I got them.  Still most of the worlds I 
detailed myself.  When FF&S came out, that added a new level of versitility. 
 Now I could create technologies for my universe or adapt the curent stuff. 
 This game was very versitile in all its incarnations.

2. The Thrill of the Unknown.
The game had all these worlds, all these sectors, and the way we played was 
that the GM would make a world as we got to that area of space.  Nobody not 
even the GM knew what we would find there.  Then the bit about grandfather 
and the ancients came out, more mystery, more unknown and forgoten civs and 
techs.  In a recent and prolly the only game I have played in T4(mostly GM 
at home), I\'m not saying which one but my fellow crewmates know what I mean, 
the adventure is all that and more.  Mystery after Mystery!

3. The Commraderie
This game has been around for a long time, 2 posibly 3 generations of gamers 
know about it and/or play on a regular basis.  that is a large family of 
fellow enthusiasts.  where else can people sit down and discuss how to build 
a ship, or an Empire?  Back when Marc created the game there was no 
internet, he had no idea that the community of gamers could be so huge 
untill a small fraction of them connected in the "etherial void".  No where 
else have I meet such good friends which have a common interest.  Even 
though I have never met them personaly, I still consider them part of the 
"Traveller Family"

Ghods!  there I go being romantic again!
Can\'t help it, I\'m a noble, and speeches are our thang! :)

Let\'s not forget that men can be raped, too. Yes, statistically, they\'re a
small fraction of those who suffer from this abhorrent crime, but it does
happen, particularly in prison.

The term "rape" is often used as a metaphor for being grossly mistreated.
While somewhat too blunt a metaphor for my taste, it\'s usage is common
enough that I don\'t think it\'s worth getting too riled about.

Subject: Re: Stand Up, etc.

Maybe it\'s just me, Mr. Cynical, but I\'ve made it a practice to not buy
anything unless I\'ve had a chance to thoroughly investigate it. Don\'t take
this the wrong way Paul, Ken, & company. I agree with you. It\'s just that my
spending $ has always been limited so I try to plan ahead with my Trav
purchases through the years.  I spend a fair amount of time going through the
book trying to see if I can use it. The TML has been great for this. I get an
idea of what to expect when I\'m in the area of the only Trav carrier.
Everytime I find that the TML majority is right.

I\'ve only bought the first book so far. My campaign is late in the MT era and
neither I nor my players want to switch settings so certain books have no use
for me. I\'ll probably pick up EA and CSC. They\'re the best books so far and
they\'re not setting specific. I tend to focus on out-of-print stuff. I
participated in Paul\'s auction and won V&V. Yes, it was a sight unseen
purchase but since I\'d heard nothing but praise about it I figured it would
be a safe buy.... and it was! =)

Product investigation prior to purchase would appear to be the only prudent
course of action until the IG track record becomes consistent.

You misunderstood what I said, and I think we are in agreement.

I like a character coming out of chargen with multiple skills, but, 
like what you have just stated above, I don\'t want character\'s 
comining out with any one of those skills at level 9 or greater.  In 
fact, I think you should rarely see a level 5 come out of chargen.

BUT,  a character with several, different skills (all with their 
skill level ranging from 1 to, say, 4-5) is something I do like about 
T4 chargen.

In CT, I always felt that the skill levels were appropriate, but 
characters came out of chargen with too few total skills.

Then Book 4:  Mercenary came along and introduced the one-year 
chargen method (where you roll each year).  I think this is also 
referred to as advanced chargen.

I thought that this created characters with a good mix between 
multiple skills while keeping a lid on the levels to those skills.

MT copied both these methods in the MTPM.  The usual 4-year method 
was used in the first part of the book, and characters came out too 
weak skill wise.  In the latter of the book, advanced chargen options 
were available for certain character classes.

The great thing about T4 chargen is that it produces 
characters--created with the 4-year method--that are on par with 
characters created with the one year advanced method.

Giving a character a skill for every year in T4 vs giving him one for 
every 4 years, as in CT, was a stroke of genius.

But, it works a little too good.  There needs to be some sort of 
control imposed.

I, personally, would like to see a roll applied each year to see if 
the character gets a skill that year.  This roll would be pretty easy 
to achieve success in, and I picture it akin to the skill roll in the 
CT/MT one-year advanced chargen systems.

Players would make this roll most of the time, but when they didn\'t, 
this would cut down on the skill levels awarded.

I also like Eris\' comment that the skill lists used in chargen be 
expanded so that more skills are available, and the same skill does 
not keep poping up for the character.


> Also, In T4 chargen, characters can *never* gain more than 2-3 skill
> points a *year*.

I agree with this too.  See my comments on the experience system.  I 
said that the experience system should limit a character to advancing 
in skills and levels to about the same as he would in chargen.

2-3 skill points per year is fine with me, but this should only be 
allowed for a year of heavy adventuring where the character is 
exposed to much more experience than a normal professional just doing 
his job (who would probably only get one skill level in that year).

Now, here\'s a great comment.  Let\'s just fix the damn thing 
ourselves.

Talk about no expense for IG!

What is left for IG to do?  See my other post on this where I suggest 
that the errata be printed with the office printer, copied on the 
office copier, and be available to anyone who sends in an SASE.

And, they\'ll need to make a flyer (again on the office printer using 
the office copier) to place in the other products coming out this 
year to advertise that errata is available for FS.

If the TML is willing to get behind this idea and work at getting 
"perfect" FS data, I can\'t see a reason why IG would turn it down.

We\'re talking virtually no expense!

Michael, I think you should take the ball and run with it.  The TML 
should get organized about this.  

Let\'s have team leaders in charge of a sector.  One person will be 
responsible for one subsector.  Michael is the overall project leader 
who will collect the data and coordinate the project.

I think first, we should make a list of all the important stuff that 
needs to be addressed--Vland\'s population and whatever else.

We should compare the data to the 1100 "official" data from DGP and 
whatever other sources are available to make sure the M0 data makes 
sense when compared to the 1100.

Somebody has suggested using the TNE rules for the deterioration of a 
planet\'s stats.  That might be a good idea.

When we get done, we have the list proof read this data with a fine 
tooth comb, and when we are absolutely sure we have created exactly 
what we want, we send it to IG with an "our compliments" tag.

Let\'s not just fix the big boo boos in FS--let\'s fix the the damn 
data.  Let\'s make sure that we are not going to find another problem 
later.

And, let\'s keep a handle on getting too "fix-crazy".  If the star 
system only needs its law level and government code change--otherwise 
the data entry is fine, let\'s just fix those two stats and move on.

We don\'t need to generate new data for the whole book--just police 
the data that\'s there.

I volunteer to be one of the sector leaders, to coordinate activities 
in one sector, and to work on one of the subsectors (in whatever 
sector I am assigned)  myself.

Who else is going to get behind this project?

Kenneth.

PS  I guess somebody should go to IG (or Marc) first to see if they 
will use the data that we generate and fix.  I don\'t see why we 
should go to all this trouble first--only to find that IG won\'t use 
it.

Michael may want to be the person that approaches IG on this, but if 
not, I can take care of it if I have the support of the rest of the 
list.

From the replies, I\'m actually surprised that this is a problem in so 
many games.  As a member of the TAS, a character is allowed one High 
Passage every two months.  This can usually be sold for 90% of its 
face value--Cr9,000.  That\'s only Cr4,500 for the character per 
month.

Is an additional Cr4,500 for a character per month that much of a 
game unballanceer?   I don\'t really think so, and this has never been 
a problem in my game.

You can make it easy on the character by allowing him to be able to 
cash in the HP right there at the TAS when he receives his passage.

TAS clerk:  "You are due for your high passage sir."

PC:  "Ah, thanks.  Listen, could I have that in cash?"

TAS clerk:  "Yes sir.  There\'s the standard 10% handling fee that 
applies.  Here\'s your 9000 credits.  Would you like cash, or would 
you like me to update your creditchit?"

But, if you think that the extra Cr4,500 is hurting your game, you 
can get a little harder on how the character obtains this money.

Here\'s how I handle it in my game.

First off, the characters need to go to a TAS office to receive the 
HP.  Those are located at class A and B starports.  If the characters 
don\'t happen to be on a world with a class A or B starport, then they 
are just going to have to wait until they get to one.

We\'re playing in the Aramis subsector of the Spinward Marches right 
now, and there are only 10 TAS offices in the entire subsector (class 
A or B starports).  They are spread out through the subsector, but 
there are definite areas that the players can go that makes obtaining 
the HP highly inconvienent.

Next, when my players get to the TAS offices, they receive their HPs 
(and any do them), but the TAS office does not cash them in like in 
the example I cited above. 

I figure that the TAS does not loose money on dispensing all those 
HPs to all it\'s members every other month.  They probably get them 
(or print them) for next to nothing, or trade them for some other 
service they perform.  Either way, I can see the TAS going out of 
business real quick if it gave Cr4,500 per month to all of its 
members--I don\'t care if it is MCr1 to get in the place.

(I also don\'t think that when some characters get the membership 
during chargen--say a Naval character, that the Navy actually pays 
MCr1 to get the character in.  I think that the fee is waved by the 
TAS by special arrangement for whatever reason with the Navy--I don\'t 
know, maybe the TAS allots so many memberships to various services 
each year for political reasons.)

So, since the character cannot immediately cash in the HP, that\'s 
exactly what he\'s got--a piece of paper allowing transport.

Many times this is useless to the character, and he wants to cash it 
in.  In my game, he needs to find a buyer to do this.

The standard rate is Cr9,000 for a high passage, but sometimes a 
character has to take what he can get--depending on how many buyers 
he finds and how bad they need it.  He might even get more for it.

This leads to all sorts of role playing situations, and I\'ve even 
implemented patrons, rumors, and adventures through this interaction.

So, you see, the HP does not need to be a burden to you as a GM.  Get 
creative and make it work for you.

Kenneth.

OK, that what I though.  Note: in an intertial reference frame
the ship will gain mass as it accelerates.  If the thrust
remains invarient, it\'s acceleration will decrease.  However,
it\'s not clear how the trust would or wouldn\'t change.  For
a reaction drive, the reaction mass will also increase
relativistically and, as long as the ship can push is
back at the same relativistic speed then acceleration
will be constant.  Reactionless drives are another ball
of wax alltogether.

Also, one should be careful using an accelerating ship as
a reference frame.  Only _interial_ reference frames are
equally valid and this is not an interial reference frame.

FRANKLIN\'S NOTES ON VARGR CHARACTERS IN "TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA"

These are my notes on converting the rules in _Alien_Module_3:_Vargr_
(AM3:V) and _Aliens_Vol._1:_Vilani_&_Vargr_ (AV1:V&V) to TNE.  

ATTRIBUTES:

  STR  2D6-2
  AGL  2D6
  CON  2D6-2
  INT  2D6-1
  EDU  2D6-1
  PRS  2D6-1  (See below) 

  PSI  (As normal for the campaign)
  VCD  1D6  (See below) 

Personality (PRS): 

The sixth attribute in the UPP of a Vargr character is called
"Personality" (not "Charisma") so as to distinguish this attribute from
the new pseudo-attribute "Vargr Charisma/Dominance" (see below). 
Personality (PRS) is used in place of the usual attribute Charimsa (CHR)
in all ways.  All CHR-based skills are instead based on PRS for Vargr.  

Vargr Charimsa/Dominance (VCD): 

This pseudo-attribute replaces Social Standing (SOC) in all ways.  All
references to SOC instead refer to VCD for Vargr characters.  

  * VCD can be changed (increased and/or decrreased) as a result of career
    resolution: 

    - When making a Commission roll: 

      -- Succeeding by 2+ points gives +1 to VCD;
      -- Failing by 2+ points gives -1 to VCD.  

    - When making a Promotion roll:

      -- Succeeding by 2 or 3 points gives +1 to VCD;
      -- Succeeding by 4+ points gives +2 to VCD;
      -- Failing by 2 or 3 points gives -1 to VCD;
      -- Failing by 4+ points gives -2 to VCD.  

  * VCD can also change as a result of adventuring.  At the end of an
    adventure, when awarding XP, the player rolls a Difficult test of the
    Vargr character\'s Leadership skill *opposed* by the Vargr\'s current
    VCD:  

    - An Outstanding Success gives +1 to VCD; 
    - A (regular) Success or Failure does not change VCD; 
    - A Catastrophic Failure gives -1 to VCD.  

REENLISTMENT/CONTINUATION:

Vargr characters do *not* suffer the usual DM -2 when changing careers.
Instead, apply the number of points of VCD lost/gained within that term as
a DM penalty/bonus.  

SKILLS:

Luck (INT) - Determination: 

This skill functions as per GDW\'s _Dark_Conspiracy_ and/or the article in
a back issue of _Traveller_Chronicle_.  Consider this skill to be TNE\'s
version of Jack-of-all-Trades.  

Observation:

Remember that Vargr have better senses of smell and hearing than do
humans.  However, their sensitivity to color is not as acute as that of a
human (but they are not color-blind).  

Unarmed Martial Arts:

In my campaign, this skill has the three cascades Block (for blocks and
evades), Strike (for punching and kicking), and Throw (for throws and
grapples).  Vargr have an additional cascade for this skill, called
Infighting.  This cascade *must* be the primary cascade for Vargr.  It
covers the use of a Vargr\'s claws and teeth.  

DEFAULT SKILLS:

All Vargr have the default skills Leadership 0, Observation 0, and Unarmed
Martial Arts (Infighting) 0.  

CAREERS:

Vargr may chose any career listed in TNE, plus any new careers listed
below.  Any career from TNE that is listed below *must* be used as
modified herein.  

Loner (New): 
  Prerequisites: 
    INT 6+ or EDU 6+.  
    Homeworld TL = Early Stellar+.  
  First Term Skills: Bargain 1, Luck 1, Unarmed Martial Arts (Infighting) 
    1, Explore 1, Gun Combat 1, Space Vessel 1, Spacehand 1, Technician 1.  
  Subsequent Terms Skills: Charm, Determination, Economics, Explore, Gun 
    Combat, Interaction, Melee, Space Tech, Space Vessel, Spacehand, 
    Technician, Vehicle, Vice.  
  All Terms
  Special Adventure: 7+ fo Medical, Acrobat, Artisan, Crime, Engineer, 
    Explore, Gun Combat, Interaction, Melee, Physical Science, Spacehand, 
    Technician.  
  Promotion: 7+, DM +1 if INT 8+, DM +1 if EDU 8+, DM +1 if PRS 8+.  
  Contacts: One per term, any (non-Vargr on 8+).  
  Other Effects: 
    Use Streetwise asset instead of VCD for income.  
    3 ship DMs per term for a Scout/Courier.  

Manager (aka "Leader"): 
  Prerequisites: 
    VCD 6+.  
    Homeworld TL = Industrial+.  
  All else as per TNE.  

Medicine: 
  Doctors ("commissioned officers") roll for Promotion to determine
    changes, if any, to VCD.  
  All else as per TNE.  

Wealthy Traveller (aka "Aristocrat"): 
  Prerequisites: VCD 10+.  
  All else as per TNE.

While I tend to feel that Twolf has gone as far to one extreme as Ken may
be on the other, I AM distressed with the tone the list is taking.

I am not interested, and tend not to read, the tirades against IG.  I AM
interested, and try to participate (WINMAIL.DAT permitting!) in the
threads promoting ideas for campaigns, and fixes for the current rule set.

If what IG is doing so offends you, then promote something different.
This constant harrassment of the company reflects poorly on a _concept_
that I ENJOY, and share with others, in the form of Traveller.

It is easy to destroy, difficult to create.  If you can do a better job
(and prove it in the marketplace), then you will have said all you need to
say about this incarnation of Traveller.

For higher passenger capacity, you could move up to a grav veranda.

b) Does not result in overly skilled characters.

Here is my system - any comments?

Alternative Character Generation System

Fistly Characteristics are rolled in the usual way with an additional
characteristic - Memory.  Which I use isnstead of Education (I use
Education as more of a general Knowledge Skill). This fixes the problem
that the Education rewards are too frequent (IMHO).
Note any increase to INT can instead be taken to MEM.

Secondly the characters progress through the carreers in the normal
manner, but aquiring skills slightly differently.  Instead of the
character getting Skill levels in the skills, they obtain \'Generation
Points\' in the skills, these are then used after mustering out to buy
the actual skill level, the cost is based on the following progression.
Level 1 - 1 generation point
Level 2 - 3 generation points
Level 3 - 6 generation points
Level 4 - 10 GP
Level 5 - 15 GP
Level 6 - 21 GP
A character will get 2 GP\'s in a skill if it is radomly rolled on the
skill tables or just 1GP if they choose the skill (characteristic
increases must be rolled).  Any GPs left assigned to skills but
insuficent to buy the next level are either ignored or can be used to
buy experience levels (if using KB 2.0).

Example
Jerry spends 2 terms in the Navy(I\'m doing this from memory and might
not get the tables right) the and rolls, Pilot 4 Times, Navigation
Twice, J-O-T Once, and Handgun Once.
Using Normal Generaton He would be:-
Pilot 4, Navigation 2, JOT 1, and Handgun 1
Using my alternative he would be:-
Pilot 3 (GPs=8), Nav 2 (GPs=4), JOT 1 (GPs=2),Handgun 1 (GPs=2)

This reduces the number of skills a character gains during generation
greater than level 3, without reducing the number lower than level 3.
Which is a good balance IMO.  It also fits well with my experience
system (Which I posted a few weeks ago), which requires characters to
spend more points the higher their skill is.

I also allow characters 3 \'Fate Points\' in character generation, which
can be used to re-roll any unsatisfactory roll (including a
characteristic).

Any comments?

Chris.

I think we should do it here, it seems more relevant to a Traveller

Travellerites. ;-)

Right now, I\'m pondering the application of FUDGE to combat. The system 
I\'m working on is a fusion of FUDGE, Traveller, and CORPS.

Yeah! What he said! :-P

I for one, also think its *obvious* that Jumpdrive technology isn\'t a 
regular technology easily stumbled upon by the progressive advance of 
industrial innovation.

Major races "assert" that they discovered the thing independently, and 
I\'m sure most actually believe that fact. The origins of the thing could 
easily be lost in the annals of time, or history rewritten by those close 
to it, so that the following generations believe.

This is further proof of the relative "hardness" of Traveller. A 
technology so central and magical to interstellar society is not normally 
discovered in the regular course of history, is practically 
incomprehensible to even the most advanced and intelligent sophonts, and 
it takes *one* "mule" or genetic mutation with intelligence so completely 
off the scale to invent it.

I think the premise is great! Imagine, the Imperium and surrounds likely 
the only ones lucky enough *in the galaxy* to have spawned a mutant with 
enough intellegence to create the foundation of interstellar society!

To me, this is more beautiful and more easily reconcilable with our 
current view of physics than Warp Drive being a logical development of 
technological societies, and the Light-barrier as easily broken as the 
sound barrier...

	FIRST SURVEY - Gov=law level was evident last October!!!

	Apologies if this has been posted before...

	What follows is part of a posting submitted by MM six months ago. It was
an early draft of the data for First Survey. You will note that back in
October when this set of data was posted to TML that in _every case_ gov
level is equal to law level.

	I found this posting from my email archives - I keep everything I ever
receive. I also note that not one single person on the list at the time
noticed that gov and law were the same. However it was noted by someone on
the list that there was a high incidence of \'44\' in the gov and law level
positions in some systems\' UWP, especially with planets that have zero
population as well.

	I have the full posting, if anyone wants me to post it to the list. The
following version is cut down for clarity\'s sake, and shows just the four
subsectors to spinward. I\'ve deleted lots of stuff for this posting,
including players\' data for all systems listed, i.e. UWP\'s containing
physical characteristics only.

	Btw, note how the physical characteristics of the draft data below seem to
match the data in First Survey, while the pop, gov and law levels differ
wildly in many instances.

	Also, another interesting point of note is that if you look at the
referee\'s data in First Survey, Sylea has a different law level number to
the gov level. It appears to be the only system that seems correct,
apparently. No, I tell a lie, Azimuth at 0202 in Core also has a different
law level to gov, so I guess that\'s two systems out of about 4,500 in there
that I can use...

Yes, I do. Very much how the 5fth element did it, old 50\'s and 60\'s styled
cars with perhaps something extra in design that gives it a "modern" look
(like extra smooth lines).  

Always prefered this view of the grav car over the bladerunner idea.

I add a heartfelt ME TOO! to that sentiment. Constructive criticism is one

They can make money on the original idea--they should re-print 
the corrected data in the already planned M0/FS hardback release.

Twolf,

Can you see that little smiley face up there when you quoted me?  
When most people see that, they realize that they are reading a jest.

I thought what the original poster said was funny, and I made light 
of the situation.

It is too bad that you don\'t realize that.

If you want to go some where else with your Traveller talk, then that 
is your loss, because the TML is the best place around.

My initial reaction to your post was to say, "So what?  Go."

But, I\'ll tell you.  I don\'t really want you to go.  You are free to 
do whatever you like, of course, but you will be missing out on all 
of the great things that the TML has to offer.

I\'ve got two more things to tell you--since you have a problem seeing 
it yourself.

One, I think that my position on IG is clear to everyone.  I want 
them to succeed, and I want Traveller to be the best SF RPG ever.

Yes, I\'m starting to feel betrayed at some of the stuff I\'ve seen out 
of IG, and I\'ve been praying for somebody like the original DGP staff 
to be T4\'s Knight in Shining Armor.

But, I also haven\'t given up on them.  If you will notice, I\'ve 
started two threads that focus on positive things about IG and T4.  
One is the "IG Positive Thread", the other is "T4-Revised".

And, I\'m behind the FS fix thread in which I\'ve called for members of 
this list to team together, fix the FS data, and send it in to 
IG--doing all of IG\'s work for them.

Now, ask yourself, are those the actions of a person who wants to 
see IG and T4 go down the tubes? 

Plainly, the answer is no.

This leads me to the second thing that I\'ll tell you--and I shouldn\'t 
have to.  If you don\'t like my, or anybody else\'s, post on this list, 
you can do one thing.

Let me clue you in--

DON\'T READ IT.

When you see my name next to a post, just ignore the damn thing if it 
makes you so upset.

Sheesh.  You\'d think you could figure that out on your own.

Now, if you want to get all bent out of shape and leave the list, 
then do so.  

But, I\'m telling you now, I would even welcome you to stay--and 
that\'s what I\'m doing.

Kenneth.

   For God sake, he was making a f*cking joke!

   Not that it matters, my impression is that Twolf was looking for an
excuse to take a powder.  Maybe he should change his name to \'Tpuppy\'. 
In any event what he really needs is a good wet nurse, not a mature
audience.

   Just calling them like I see them...

Interesting.  In the "Blank" vs. "No Blank" war of the time, that little 
detail was missed by every single one of us who were here at the time.  
Marc posted it for comment, and all we could do was fight over whether 
there should or shouldn\'t be blank worlds.  We fought over something 
that, in the end, was a miniscule issue as compared to the big picture of 
messed up data.  Very interesting.

And a telling point for those who say TML is ideal for playtesting.  
Apparently, we aren\'t very good at that, either.  As witness the current 
flamewar, we\'re far more likely to pick up one point and beat it to death 
than to do a careful analysis of the situation.  We let our pet projects 
and pet peeves get in the way of actually making sure things work.

Naturally, all of the above applies to me, too.  I was here back then, 
and I was posting my "pro-blank" messages as much as anyone - and of 
course I missed the LL/Gov problem as well.

Bruce, thanks for posting that little gem.  Very instructive.

	The actual spreadsheets are in private email to Joe; look for them on his
site sometime soon. Incidentally, I\'d like to publicly thank Steve Brengard
for taking the time to figure out why they wouldn\'t work in Excel95,
converting and consolidating them, and then emailing them back to me.

Ok, as you all know by now Twolf is a friend of mine.
I was not happy with what he did but I talked to him 
and explained his reasons and I have accepted them
as I accept him as a friend.

Now for the rest of you  fools its one thing to decided to leave an 
argument because you cant take the stupid  people and dont want to 
argue any more.  But its  coward  that  hits  somebody 
after they have left.  If you were a true man harold you would have 
said this before he left to his face. I am  pretty sure you would learn 
why he is called Twolf.  If you want to know I think that his 
actions made him more mature then any of us.  He has moved away from 
you worthless people.  

I would do the same but I dont turn my back on known scum 

Just calling them as I know them

I apologize  to the rest of the members of the TML for my actions, but 
I cant let this go.  I will no longer post on this subject.  If some 
of you want a fight my email is attached and I ll reply to those
email  sent to that address.

Dudes, welcome to the Tailfins. The Tailfins is an exclusive club
founded during the rule of man, the main aim of the club is the 
promotion of terran Car culture of something known as the 50s.
Chrome, gold flec paint and a devotion to the king are also
major aspects of the Club. Another custom is the Car show and
cruise held quarterly on many resort planets with sizable local
chapters. In days gone by entry to these events was limited to
ground cars only, but with the passing of time, the definition
of Classic applies to any vehicle 30 years or older. The only
qaulifcation now is the vehicle must be vagly car or bike shaped.
One may recognize a member by his clasic hairdo Known as a DA
for arcane reason, or hers which is dye some bright colour and
teased up and called Bufont. Both male and female members wear
bright satin jackets with their local chapter logo.

Note, there was some speculation the the Tailfins were a front
for Solomani Intelligence during Solomani rim war. These were
just rumors thou..

on the main THUDDD page: 

* Formatting of entries is the responsibility of entry authors.  The
  THUDDD coordinator will take reasonable steps such as turning section
  headings into HTML headers, making embedded URLs into functional links,
  and so forth; but nothing beyond this is guaranteed.  Most notably,
  tabular and other monospace-font text should be formatted using
  *spaces only* (not tabs!), and be ready to use \'as is\' in the entry
  submission message.  Also, no line of text should exceed 150 characters
  in length; longer lines may get truncated, and no repair efforts are
  guaranteed if this occurs.

As I did not make this clear for the May THUDDD, and some of the entries
got a bit weirdly formatted as a result, I\'m willing to accept and place
on the website corrected tabular data from any author who wants to provide
it.  I will not resend this to the lists, however.

Joe, with all due respect (and I mean that), you are making it sound 
like it is our fault for the FS debacle.

It\'s not.  It would have been great if someone would have caught 
it, but they didn\'t.  I, personally, didn\'t even look at the data 
that hard when it was posted.  The reason?  I had trust that 
something Marc Miller did himself was going to be pretty good.

And, I can\'t agree that the blank vs. non-blank debate was not 
worthwhile.  At that time, I argued for complete referee maps in FS.

Have you seen how many people now wish that FS did have complete maps 
for the referee--with starports, bases, gas giants, and all the 
important information we Traveller players are used to getting at a 
glance without having to look up a hex number in a table?

I understand Marc\'s use of the blank maps, but I just think he went 
about it wrong.  He should have included complete maps in FS for the 
referee and one blank map for the referee to photocopy for his 
players.

That way, refs would have been able to implement Marc\'s "M0 
discovery" idea by placing a little information on the blank map by 
hand as they wanted to--and still, they would have the more useful 
maps for their disposal.

So, in sum, I\'m saying that I too am sorry that nobody caught the 
LL-GG mistake, but I can\'t feel bad about that because it was not our 
job.  IG has the ultimate responsibility in that department.

And, I don\'t think you\'ve been fair in saying that the blank vs 
non-blank debate was a miniscule issue when, if more of the non-blank 
arguments were used in FS, more people would have been happier 
with the  the product.

Definitely, more complete maps would have helped 
(but not entirely fix, of course) the product\'s quality.

You mean like "I cannot support any medium that would advocate such an act
nor tolerate a person who would.  Kenneth, you should move to Germany
the neo-nazis are recruiting."

This is just plain crap, and I lost pretty much all of the respect for
twolf that his more reasoned posts had engendered.  Comparing someone to a
Nazi is not far from comparing them to a muurderer.  Good move, asshole.
(I am usually more polite, but Nazi comparisons to me are like rape
comparisons are to another poster here.)

Perhaps, if you wanted to be considered an adult, you might have stayed
around to hear the reponse to your infantile "I am not listening, and you
are all just dumb" leavetaking.  But then, as you have said, you have
unsubscribed, and will not see it.  Pity.

Oh, I must quote: "If you were a true man harold you would have
said this before he left to his face."

Kind of hard when someone says "You are neo-nazi\'s, and I am not listening
anymore."

Remember, you are known as much be your friends as by yourself.

Scott, kind of pissed.

If you can\'t help the players sppend Cr 4,500 a month you are not doing
a good enough job of describing all the neat stuff you can buy in
Traveller.

If TAS gets Cr 1,000,00 from every member and invests this money at a 7%
real (after inflation if the Imperium has it) they will be earning Cr
70,000 per year on his money.

They will owe each member 1 high passage every 2 months.  I assume that
the Imperial Calender uses 13 28 day months (to the extent it has months
at all) + Holiday = 365 days per year.  Therefore TAS owes each of its
members 6.5 High Passages per year.  These High Passages will cost Cr
65,000 per year if TAS pays full price & no one ever cashes a passage
in.  If a member always cashes his coupons in this will cost TAS Cr
58,500 per year.

TAS can make money on its members this way.  Further more TAS is only
having to pay interest (in the form of High Passage coupons) on the
money you have already given them.  Wouldn\'t you love it if people gave
you Cr 1,000,000 (or even $1,000,000).

In addition TAS only has to pay out passages as long as you are alive. 
For this reason TAS would rather you took the coupon, travelled to some
interesting (read dangerous) planet and were killed, because it will cut
down on their expenses.  Naturally it would be bad for their immage if
they were to admit this so they will try & be a bit more subtle about
this.  This is the primary reason why TAS in my universe will frequently
have free lectures on the equivilent of big game hunting & the civilian
version of the Imperial Marine meteoric assault from orbit.

Remember TAS wants you dead so they don\'t have to spend money on you :)

Probably because ex Imperial military members are already self selected
for recklessness & letting them in will provide reckless (er heroic)
role models that their other members will emulate & get themselves
killed.  No doubt they have done an actuarial study on this topic &
determined how many memberships they can give away & increase their
revenues.

Does it really matter if IG uses it... If it is available freely to all on
the TML, and WE all use it.. I can\'t see a problem. If someone is new to
the game, and not on the TML, it doesn\'t really affect them. If IG produces
future modules which conflicts with our data, we could publish fixes. 
I personally feel that this is a good idea.

OK, the downside is that we now have to get team of people with disparate
viewpoints to work together. If this is to be done properly, and someone is
chosen as team leader, part of his/her responsibility will be to resolve
disputes. How do we give him/her this authority?

Don\'t get me wrong... I would **really** like to see this done.

In addition, would it include maps? Proper **maps**?

How long did we assume that characters of Solomani ancestry were likely 
to live?  Life expectancy is of course extremely variable and hard to 
predict given the incredible size and diversity of the Imperial population, 
but it could be that at age 42 (six terms), a character was looking at 20 
or more years of serious adventuring before slowing down at 65, then 
retiring at 80, then dying at 100.  A Vilani character, as we learned later, 
might live to 140 (or was it 160?), so at age 42 could expect maybe 80 more 
years of adventuring before taking that desk job and eventually retiring.  

The prevalence of older characters adds an element of alienness to the far 
future for me.  Now I do recall that in our mid-twenties you and I were indeed 
good solid characters, but you\'ll concede that we were the exception.

Sorry about that. In my Traveller universe precognition is a no-no. The
artifact given to Zhodani to make them go the core route creates computer
simulations of the encounters and updates the data whenever it gets access
to a mind to probe. Thus the Zhos see the future and also sees that the
future changes (scratch determinism) when they do things.
I forgot that other refs actually allow precognition, I just think
precognition is as hard to referee as timetravel and disallow it but my
players doesn\'t know that nor the Zhos.

As precognition etc is in the canon I\'ll probably have to join Eris\'s
"Church of hereticism".

Pretty cool to extrapolate psychohistory 50 000 years. What were we when
the Droynes got the coyns? Pre-agricultural at best. The toughest to do for
grandfather though was by psychohistory extrapolating that Aslans would be
recognized as a major race despite that terrans gave it to them.
I\'d say either he meddled with them (as Ethans excellent post made clear)
or he cheated by using precognition. But if he used precognition then why
didn\'t he do that to predict the mess his children would make forcing hime
to spend several thousand years to exterminate them? As I said before
precognition opens a pretty large can of worms.

Hard SF is always in relation to something else (soft SF, space opera).
Traveller is certainly not hard SF when compared to SF literature but I
think it is when compared to other SF rpg. The rpg with the most hard SF
feel was IMHO Traveller2300 but Traveller comes as a good second. Depends
on what you call SF rpg of course: the hardest SF rpg ever, I think, was
1:st edition Twilight 2000 but that doesn\'t count.

The SF rpg with the most unworkable ideas was something way back called
SpaceQuest(?) with tim units of day, week, year etc changed to be easier to
write in decimal. I think they kept 1 second the same length but I\'m not
shure. There was 100 seconds to the minute, 100 minutes to the hour, 10
hours to the day and 1000 days to the year (all taken from memory).

I finally tracked down the origins of Victoria (Spinward Marches). If 
you\'ve seen the original article in JTAS#2, you\'ll remember that Victoria 
is based on a planet called Durrent, taken from a novel called Prisoners 
of the Sky by C.C. MacApp.

Well after much diligent searching, I now hold in my hands Prisoners of 
the Sky! (Lancer Books, 1969, $0.75-!!!!--remember when books cost less 
than your allowance?--!!!). (Of course it cost me more than $0.75 to buy 
the puppy, sigh!)

The front cover depitcs a rather abstract background, with a reddish moon 
in the sky. The moon shows lines and some largish craters (this is 
presumably Albert...but I wonder if there is a old base on it!). 
Hanginting in front of the moon is a blimp with a gondala. In the 
foreground is a man with goggles and what appears to be a oxygen hose 
running over his shoulder. He is grimacing, so I know he\'s got to be Our 
Hero.

The back description reads as follows:

- ----

Poison Planet

Earth colonzied Durrent, a strange world of high mesas and poinson 
valleys, where men could live only on the highest peaks. There were other 
stars to colonize, and better worlds--but space was vast. There was no 
way off Durrent until the chance visit of another wandering starship. The 
men of Earth were there to stay.

Even though much of the planet was forbidden, locked behind the barriers 
of poison gas, the colonies grew and became separate city-states. Then 
war broke out, and one young Fleet officer of Mesa Lowry, armed only with 
an outmoded traning ship and a crew of half-trained civilians, found that 
the future of his world rested on the outcome of his battle to clear his 
family name of dishonor!

- ----

So you can see Victoria was modeled pretty closely after Durrent.

the minor-major race distinction says you have to INVENT the damned thing

Circular to the extreme.
We\'re talking about how he could have known which races to be major before
they had any technology at all. You said maybe he just picked the 6 closest
to home. I say nay there are lots closer that weren\'t picked.
Then you say he picked the six closest that were MAJOR races. I stand

Actually relativity and quantum mechanics problem with each other are more
fundamental than lack of observations. They\'re sort of mutually exclusive
regarding their underpinnings and all tries at bringing them together have
failed. My bet is that general relativity will be modified pretty soon (as
soon as we solve the missing matter problem) and then made to fit quantum
mechanics as the body of data that fits quantum mechanics is HUGE compared
to the tiny amounts of general relativity data we have. Special relativity
will remain as is.

RAMBLING WARNING ON

I\'m slowly (as I\'m running a campaign) converting my game into something
FUDGE-like but I started this before FUDGE and the likeness is only
accidental (or this IS the proper way to do roleplaying mechanics). The
main thing against FUDGE is their weird D3 system. Anybody even mildly
irritated over T4 task system should blow his fuses when seeing the FUDGE
D3 dice. The consistent use of logarithms for conversion between real
world(tm) and game mechanics is a good one though.

Aha, the answer to one of my PC questions: My player asked why only some
planets are marked Amber Zones by TAS while most Green zone planets seem
just as dangerous (wherever you land the GM cooks up some adventure nearly
killing you).
The real answer to this is that the only safe planets are the Red zones as
TAS want you killed and thus stear you away from those dull safe places ;)

Well, if you look at third world nations, most of them buy weapons from
other countries.  Weapons far beyond what they can actually produce in
their own country. 

In Traveller, I would imagine that many of the low tech worlds, would
buy high tech weapons from their neighbors.  So that TL-1 worlds won\'t
have people with swords and spears, but the standard TL-12 combat
armor, ACRs and RAM grenades. There won\'t just be a few of these
people, but probably hundreds to thousands, depending on the size of
thepopulation. This pretty much eliminates the ability for players to
take over low tech planets.  

Someone else suggestd, that we don\'t see Mercenaries taking over small
African Countries.  Well last year a group of French Mercenaries staged
a coup in Comoros, and island group north of Madagascar.  They easily
took over the island, and a few days later the French Army easily
arrested the mercenaries.  You can use this in Traveller also.  If the
players succeed, send in the Marines.

	No, I checked. All that was picked up was that a lot of the UWP\'s had \'44\'
as the last two digits for gov and law, not that _all_ of the gov and law
were the same. Someone going under the name of Amused to Death noted this
and "mentioned" it to MM.

	I disagree. I paid for a _complete_ set of accurate raw data. There are
about 4,500 UWP\'s in First Survey. Why should I spend time correcting
something that I\'ve already paid to have done?

	Also, I disagree that any of us on TML had any responsibility whatsoever
for the accuracy of the early draft of FS posted here in October. One could
follow it up to say that we should have some say in IG\'s managerial policy.
So if that\'s the case, can I ask for hot chocolate in the coffee machine
outside Marc\'s office? Thanks!

worlds) and the Geonee (J and K) background.

Does anyone knows any other existing collapsed subsector on the Net or
other official (or semi official) books


Specific question to Carlos

Do you have collpased all the Massilia Sector or just 2 subsectors?

Uh, ok, I know you love the Solomani and all, but...
The _Vilani_ invented the concept of minor/major races.
The Terrans/early Solomani didn\'t actually subscribe to the concept of
"minor" races.  The later Solomani were straight-out bigots, everyone
was "minor" compared to them.

Anyways, more on this...

Huh. Well, Glenn Hoppe (sp?) agrees with me, so nyah! ;)

I agree with you that Grandfather didn\'t just show up one day 
and drop off jump drives with instruction manuals. It\'s my assertion
that he did place them about "strategically" so that they would
be found. I mean, really, the _same thing_ has been invented in
_the exact same way_ all over the universe not only by different
human cultures, but also by _different races_??? Like, this stretches
it a bit.

The development on interstellar travel is a big thing for a race -
it make you a big player. The Vilani knew this - they made themselves
the only big player around and did pretty damn well for a few thousand years.
Why are Vilani and Solomani cultural remanants all over the Imperium
when the Geonoee and other minor races remain in their own small
corners of the galaxy? Being a "major" race has a lot of psychological
weight to it. The truth is another matter entirely.

No I\'m not. Sheesh. Tell you what - I\'ll go home and check _all_ of
the Alien modules, Solomani & Aslan, Vilani & Vargr and all my
MT stuff too. Sheesh - please don\'t tell me I don\'t know what I\'m
talking about. We all know what we\'re talking about.

On a completely irrelevant note, this is what really burns me.
This is a mailing list. You can ignore what you don\'t like.
Don\'t tell me, or anyone, to shut up and don\'t tell me I\'m getting
Traveller confused with 2010.

Well, "I am sure" that they probably discovered something that
really changed their idea of how jump drive is supposed to work.
I doubt it was corn dogs.

Anyways, this is just all a _theory_. If you have trouble 
finding everything I\'ve said written down, it\'s probably because it\'s
all a product of my warped imagination.

I must confess that I share her sentiments. Reading the TML is very
quick for me now because I just keep deleting all the messages that
have anything to do with bitching about IG and \'Last Straw\' as
the subject.

Before we lose anyone else valuable to this list, could we all make
a concerted effort to keep the subject matter related to Traveller
in its many forms? While I can understand how bitching about IG
is Traveller-related, personal attacks are not.

I read this list to get ideas for my campaign, to flesh out the
Traveller \'canon\' universe (which I use) and to get feedback on work
I\'ve done. Posts of this nature I consider useful. Lately the 
signal-to-noise ratio on this list has gotten low. 

Now, back to Traveller: there are a few helpful people on this list
who have volunteered to double-check my yacht design. It\'s using
the MT rules. Once I\'ve incorporated people\'s suggestions and finalized
it, I\'ll be making deckplans for it.

Would someone on the TML find this useful? I\'m willing to provide
the deckplans, the yacht design spreadsheet I used and my notes,
free of charge, to anyone who asks. Should I post them to the list?
Is there a web site I could send them to?

Hi  Courtney.
First of all, thanks for your reply, that already means worlds to 
me...
Second, let me point out that i really really enjoyed M:0, which i 
felt was you best Traveller product to date, excepting the flaws 
pointed out below 
Now to my problems with M:0 and FS: 
1.) On all but a few worlds Law Level and Govt. Level are identical. 
This makes the Sector data of FS almost useless, since as a Referee, 
i need to know this information about a world. Leaving it out means 
leaving out half the Role-playing relevant data. 
2.) Various worlds have data that _just can\'t be true_! 
Vlands pop is too low to make it as attractive a partner as M:0 tells 
us it was for Cleon. Many rivals of the Sylean Fed. or the 3I have 
world data that doesn\'t match the description in M:0. Internal 
consistancy is important in Traveller! That these two books and the 
included information havn\'t been more closely cross examined is in my 
eyes a bad mistake. 
3.) The proposed move by IG to declare this data official: 
While i realize that printing the book up corrected would cost a lot 
of money, these must be a way of correcting the data otherwise, even 
if it is done just by making an errata sheet available to buyers. The 
excuse that the Law Level hasn\'t been invented in the 3I at that time 
can\'t be true/relevant because: a) It is information relevant to the 
3I for later dealings with that world so there should be info like 
that available to the 3I; b) Sylea and one other world have seperate 
Law Levels; c) The data is also meant for Traveller players and 
referees, who need that data; d) The data which is wrong (Vland, 
Enemies of Cleons\'Imperium) still doesn\'t match the text in M:0 e) It 
violates Traveller canon. 4.) Your proposition to publish both books 
in one Hardback (which is good) without removing the mistakes in FS 
(which is bad, but might be tolerable if it\'s really too expensive to 
change the print templates) and without being so polite as to also 
offering to make available the added material for those who already 
bought the book. -Republishing is always a good idea, but it should 
be used to remove the errors of a given product. Look at GDW\'s 
practice: When they found that MT had many errors, they printed a new 
version, which eliminated many of the errors. They also offered 
errata sheets for SASE for those who already bought the product. 
Republishing and NOT correcting an obvious mistake, however, is 
something many people won\'t appreciate very much. At least include an 
errata sheet, if changing the templates is too expensive might 
suffice. Adding 32 pages to M:0 is o.k., but you should also consider 
those of us who already bought the M:0 book. I for one don\'t have the 
kind of cash floating around to buy every T4 book twice. However, i 
would like to have this information. You don\'t reward your faithful 
customes who buy every book you put out as soon as it\'s published by 
later putting out a new, improved edition with added material without 
also offering those individuals access to the new material in a way 
so that they won\'t have to buy everything again just to get the 
extra pages. 
5) The format in which the data is printed.
The font is too big and the spaces are too large. I would have 
preferred it to be more similar to the sector data in the MT 
Rulebooks and/or the DGP data. That way, many pages could have been 
saved for other info, or just left out to make the book cheaper. The 
data is still readable very well if that way is used, it\'s just that 
the info-space used ratio is greatly improved! In FS, about a quarter 
of the used space could have been saved and used differently or left 
out to reduce the price! 
6) I would have liked more info about he size and growth of the 3I: A 
couple of maps like in MegaTraveller showing the growth of the 
Imperium in M:0 (instead of the flow of the rebellion), as well as 
Information in the World Data of FS on when the World joined the 3I. 
But i don\'t consider this an error or ommission, it would just have 
been nice to have those... 
There are some more minor things, but i think i got the most 
important ones in this mail. I hope this mail is of any use to you.

Maybe you can tell us what you plan to do about the mistakes and why. 
That info would be greatly appreciated on the TML as well. These 
concerns are not only mine alone... Many of the TML Members share 
them. I hope you listen to the TML\'ers from time to time (always with 
humor, though) since it is the best and most active source of 
feedback you will get. It\'s not perfect, but hey, what is in this 
world ;-)? Always remember... A lack of information creates rumors. 
Rumors create uncertainty, distrust and anger. And all these make 
people forget what they came here to do... Play and develop 
Traveller! The better you keep us informed, the earlier we can voice 
our opinions and concerns. It also lessens the creation of bad blood 
afterwards.

Thanks for listening to my "ramblings",

Ad Astra,

First, I dripped scorn on two people, rather than one, without being clear
which one I was calling what.  Second, I was guilty of not having an
appropriately thick skin regarding an insult to someone else, a sin I was
bemoaning just a few days ago.

As to the first, my point was that someone has set themselves up to be
talked about in a negative way when they leave in a huff, after an
announcement that is quite insulting.  Had twold not left the list, I
suspect that he would have gotten a less negative reaction, and it would
have been to his face, but since he left his post in a public place, he
cannot be surprised when he gets commentary on it in the same public place,
regardless of whether he is there ot hear it.

My original post lost that point in the invective, on later reading.

As to the second, I do apologize.  If Kenneth wishes to take offense at the
neo Nazi comment, that is his prerogative, and it is not mine.  We are
unfortunately living in the age of inoffensiveness, where a word that
offends you is license to fly off the handle, and it is somehow the
original speaker\'s job to handle all of the reactions, including the ones
that are extreme.  Clearly, this is ridiculous, as one must choose words
for the intended effect on the target audience, not on all the possible
members of any audience.

Despite knowing and believeing that, I still rose to the bait on seeing a
comparison of someone to a Nazi, and replied immediately.  Looks like I, as
well as many other members of modern times, must work at developing a
thicker skin.

Again, apologies for the inappropriate topic and invective.

That\'s not the way I would interpret the rule. We\'ve been told that there
are different levels of jumpspace. In order to travel two parsecs you need
to travel by jump-2 space (or higher). So a jump-2 engine is an engine that
can take you into jump-2 space. Getting into jump-2 space takes 20% of your
ship\'s volume in fuel no matter how far (up to two parsecs) you actually
travel. _Unless_, that is, you have a jump governor. If you do, and if you
don\'t need to go more than one parsec away, you can use your jump-2 engine 
to get you into jump-1 space, which only costs 10% of your ship\'s volume.

If you try to use a jump engine (any jump engine) to get into jump-2 space
without having enough fuel you will fail, even if you only wanted to go one 
parsec or less.

The material that makes up optical matter is a fine powder of some sort, I 
don\'t know the composition.  I understood that the powder was held in the
anti-nodes of the intersecting planar laser beams.

I read about this in a science journal, of which I don\'t remember the name,

at the UF science library.  

I like the gravitic fields idea to actually give it more solidity.

    'body' => 'OK, I know that my last post was supposed to be the final post on this
matter, but it seems that the first post I made has now exploded a massive
war between previously friendly members of the TML (Yes, the TML, not the KBL!!)

Twolf is right to an extent.  The TML is a place for furthering Traveller.
That is why I am staying.  No, I don\'t feel personally that I can continue
to support IG with what they are producing.  I do still love Traveller, and
I want Traveller to survive.

Traveller is more than a company.  Traveller is more than a game or a group
of players.  Traveller is a feeling.  It is that feeling you get when you
stop thinking about the real world and delve into a world of the future.  A
world where everyone, no matter how small or puny they are in Real Life(tm),
can make a difference.  Traveller is a world of mystery, a world of
amazement, and a world of fantasy.  Yes, Traveller is science, but it is
also science fiction.  Traveller is a place where we can all do what we
enjoy.  I can design ships.  Others can detail worlds.  Still others can
create strange new aliens.  All of this is good, but without the others, it
is shallow.  Traveller is the collection of all of us and our creativity.
Traveller is deep, not shallow.  It is more than one man\'s vision of the
future.  It extends beyond the collection of books published.  Traveller is
alive, and will continue to live as long as we allow it.

As perhaps one of the main igniters of the fire that has been started, I\'m
now declaring an end to it.  Stop fighting and remember what we are here
for.  I say this to me, to Kenneth, to Joe, to Allen, to Twolf, to all of us
and to everyone else on the TML.

We aren\'t here to bicker or fight over IG.  Or at least we shouldn\'t be.  We
are here to grow Traveller.  We are here to define and expand Traveller.
Remember the feeling you got when you first "discovered" Traveller.  No,
really, stop reading right here and think about it for a minute...

[time for reader to think]

Now, that feeling.  Yeah, remember it?  Is that how you are feeling now?  If
not, ask yourself why.  It is likely because we (not you, we) have gotten
too involved with arguing with one another that we have lost sight of what
Traveller is.  I challenge all of you...force yourself back into the place
where you can help Traveller, and do something.

Now, a few individual comments.

To ME:  Paul, realize that sometimes you are too outspoken with your
feelings.  You tend to say things and then deal with the consequences.  Bite
your tongue and sit back and watch instead of responding.  Work on what you
do best, build things.  Build Planets and Ships, and whatever else you want
to build.

To Everyone else (about me):  Realize that Paul is outspoken.  Realize that
sometimes things that are said need to be said.  They may not be phrased
right, or use your choice of words, but they still need to be said.

To Kenneth:  Ken, realize that you have become a MAJOR contributor to the
list.  Understand that it would be easy for people to think that you are
trying to take over things, and that you are harping on the same thing.  You
sometimes see things differently than the rest of us. This is good, but
recognize that we might not at first see the relationships you see, or the
points you share.  Keep on posting.  Do what you do best, fix things.

To Everyone else (about Ken):  Understand that Ken does love Traveller.  If
he didn\'t he would be here and he wouldn\'t post as often as he does.  Also
realize that he has his viewpoint of Traveller, just as we each do.  It is
no more invalid than any of our viewpoints.  Also, if it seems that Ken is
pushing his fixes, realize that he has spent a lot of time working on them,
and he wants a corrected final project.

To Joe:  Joe, realize that, whether you can tell it is there, you are a
biased commentator.  When you started receiving a check from IG (whether
directly or indirectly) you had a vested interest in their success.  This in
no way means that you can\'t contribute.  Nor does it mean that your
contributions are invalid.  It means that you might have to work a little
harder to see clearly.  Please, keep commenting, and keep working hard.
(Personally, what little hope I have still for IG lies with you, Stu, and
the rest of CORE.)  Also, Joe, realize that whether by desire or in
reluctance, you tend to gravitate to leadership.  Many of us look to you to
see what you think before making a final decision.  Cherish that respect, it
is hard to earn.  Keep doing what you are doing, working hard to make future
Traveller products a success.

To Allen:  Allen, realize that sometimes you will not like what other people
say.  Accept that, and if necessary, reply to the person.  Don\'t judge me
too harshly based on my word choice, but also don\'t loose your fervor for
Traveller.  Accept my hand and let this fireball fall to the ground.
Understand that, while se disagree on the choice of my words, we are both
standing shoulder to shoulder where the success of Traveller is concerned.
It is the path that that success must take that we differ on.

To Twolf:  I\'m not sure if you will get this, but PLEASE, PLEASE come back.
You cannot help Traveller succeed by leaving the TML.  If you don\'t like
what Ken is posting, say so, then flood him off the list with good posts.
Post worlds, aliens, ships, adventure ideas, and much more stuff.  Lead by
example.  Many people will follow that example, and the day will come when
posts like mine and Kenneth\'s will be the far exception to the norm, and we
even might get it through our thick skulls that they don\'t fit in before we
post them.



To EVERYONE:  Can we please just end the fighting.  Craig Berry recently
sent the THUDDD ballots out.  I read something while I was browsing his pages...

>The purpose of THUDDD is to foster friendly competition among those designing

We can\'t have a friendly competition if we aren\'t friends, now can we.
Let\'s all show how mature we are and end the fighting here.  Put a tap on
the bile and let it drain out on the floor, then clean it up and throw it
out.  I\'ll be the first, I\'m throwing out the ill will, and I\'m trying here.

I\'m extending a hand here, someone take it.

(BTW, Doug, how much does it cost to have a faucet installed on the bile
duct? :)

Trying to call a truce,

I\'m sending this both to you and the list. I hope you don\'t mind.

There is an increase in negativity in tone on this list. However, 
just leaving the list isn\'t going to help matters. While I don\'t 
condone the ad hominem attacks on Twolf (or for that matter the 
attack on Ken Bearden that started this), you can\'t deny that there 
are real issues at the heart of the matter. I feel that the 
unresponsiveness of IG to issues brought up on the list makes for 
a poor business descision on IG\'s part. Statistics show that on 
average one dissatisfied customer speaks to 20 people about their bad 
experience. What\'s worse, the TML is a body of people who are (or at 
least *were*) IG\'s biggest support group. It should be a telling 
diagnostic when your core audience starts shopping for GURPS 
translations, or CORPS or what have you.

Twolf\'s problem is that by bringing this up (and I will admit that 
the tone of late is less constructive than it should be) he felt is 
was merely whining, and he was tired of reading it. It is, of course, 
his right to delete any "whine" TML traffic that comes through. To 
waste more bandwidth with a "you guys are stupid" message and then 
unsubscribing is less than helpful at remedying the situation.

Personally, I hope you reconsider. TML needs more constructive 
voices. I am not (and you seem not to be) quite the gearhead that 
others here are, but I have found your comments insightful.

That being said, I should also say that I found Twolf\'s comments 
childish. That is, in and of itself, and ad hominem attack, but it\'s 
the case. People on the list seem really fed up with everything about 
the IG issue (ie unresponsiveness, poor product et al.). I think that 
IG has a reason to feel some heat on these issues. While you can\'t 
please everyone all the time, the fact that the product is 
inconsistent and self-contradictory, with rules and practices that 
are not adequately explained serves to hurt the game. There are many 
long time Traveller fans on the list (of which I am one). I was very 
sad to see GDW go under (with more support TNE may (IMHO) have become 
a viable game).

I do think that IG has promised too much and delivered too little. If 
I were in charge, I\'d do some things differently (and generate as 
much heat for blunders on TML, but mistakes are expected and to be 
corrected.). I think the customers on the list are tired of having to 
buy the rules and sourcebooks twice, and at elevated prices to boot. 
Part of the role of the list is to point out these shortcomings.

This whole paragraph does nothing to alleviate the situation. You 
too, now, have stooped to an ad hominem attack. If Ken\'s tone was 
disturbing to you, send him private email about this. Personally, he 
started the IG positive thread to say good things about the company 
and tell them what we want to see more of. That was a great idea, and 
that thread died ignominously. He also posted at length about how 
Emporer\'s Arsenal was a great thing. He came up with a great fix to a 
ill-tested task system. While I can\'t speak for his character, Ken\'s 
posts are one of the things that makes TML worth it. Why is he the 
bad guy now? Simply because he has a lower threshold for cock-ups 
from IG? As it stands now, IG is perilously close to having their 
core audience leave its product and stop trying to get other people 
involved. That isn\'t whining, it\'s a fact. I would hate to see T4 
die, but I don\'t hold much faith in it surviving unless they can make 
some big changes and implement them quickly.

My nutshell position is this: ad hominem attacks are worthless. While 
I haven\'t been following the "IG sucks" thread (ah the wonders of a 
delete key), my interpretation is that some people on the list would 
rather stifle dissent rather than just not listen. Unfortunately 
whining is in the ear of the listener. Being the first person to yell 
"shut up" make the yeller the bad guy, not the whiner. If you don\'t 
want to read something, don\'t.

Well, from this little portion of the TML: "So long." No one is 
irreplacable, and wicked sorry that your feelings got hurt in the 
process, but as far as namecalling is concerned, you post seems more 
willing to perpetuate it than to end it. I\'m sorry you are leaving 
under less than auspicious circumstances.
