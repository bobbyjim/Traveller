I think you\'re incorrect - the Saturn system was rather expensive to run 
and threw away all the components in the process of launching.

The Shuttle was designed as part of a total package, and was intended as 
the service vehcile for a space station.  The station was included in the 
cost of the initial shuttle program - cost overruns and budget cuts 
eventually squezed the station portion of the program out of the 
picture.  

The real problems of the American space program have their roots much 
earlier, in the Cold War.  Space became a matter of competition between 
the USA and the USSR, and astronauts and cosmonauts lost their lives for 
political purposes in the race to get to the Moon.  Once that was over, 
the sense of spectacle wound down, and NASA had a problem getting 
attention and funding.

Actually, lower cost to orbit is the goal of most of the launch vehicles 
being considered now.  The big barrier is that with the stretch out of 
the shuttle\'s lifetime due to the Challenger explosion (fewer flights per 
year), it\'s going to be some time before NASA has to develop a new vehicle.

If we want a heavy lift vehicle, we should buy lift on the Energia from 
the Russians - much cheaper than buying a new vehicle of our own.

Anyway, I think we\'ve wandered rather far from the purpose of this 
mailing list.  I\'ll be happy to move this to private mail if folks would 
like to discuss this further.

Whenever I draw a planetary map, I always try to put the starports close
to the equator. I think a lot of the official ones have them there.

Equatorial launch only matters with Isp in the 700s and down
range.  Above that, it\'s easy enough to make orbit from
anywhere on any sized planet.

Traveller\'s thrusters and such are all much better than 700s.
There\'s no reason for TL9+ vehicles to prefer the equator.
Starports should be near population centers, but not too near.

On an actual starship installation, it\'s likely that these weapons will 
be installed at ten times the listed power requirement, so they can get 
the -2 Diff Mod bonus for high ROF operation.

Cheapest and most compact is the PAWS mount.  At 3200 d-tons, it\'s near 
a traditional size.  Great range performance, but it will have to deal
with armor and sandcasters.  PAWS mounts are also great candidates for
beefing up to high rates of fire; it doesn\'t take as much to do it to
a PAWS as to a laser, and meson guns can\'t be beefed up to -5 Diff Mod.

In the middle is the huge laser lance, in all categories.  It displaces
about 13000 d-tons.  It\'s enormous penetration should be more than 
enough to let it go after deep meson sites.  However, sandcasters still 
affect this weapon, and I think that you\'re allowed to fire as many 
sandcasters at an attacking laser as you like and have available.  
Also, while the rules in Battle Rider might not reflect this, I suspect 
that this weapon would go *through* a target, wasting a lot of its\' 
energy on empty space.  It would still do a lot of damage.  Another 
disadvantage is that it needs four times as much power as the spinal 
mounts.  It\'s massive (which could cause an increase in the size of 
your maneuver drive) but it has no length requirement.  I call it a 
laser lance, because while there\'s no reason why the lens, which is 
only 380 d-tons of the design, couldn\'t be made movable, if it were 
movable it would probably need more surface area.

Most expensive, biggest (at over 48000 d-tons), and with a big support
crew, is the meson gun.  It doesn\'t have the 2400 Mm effective range
that the other two weapons have.  It has a big surface area requirement.
But the only defense against a hit from this weapon is the meson screen,
and it would need to be a big meson screen.

Comments, anyone?

TNE, there is a massive blank patch on my map between the Marches and 
Coalition Space. What clusters of worlds have survived in between? My

and I\'d like an idea of any major centres of the Imperium, before they 
reach them. Any comments would be gratefully recieved.

A final note: does anybody out there know anything about solar sails for

Is there anybody who is following the TNE background with the MT or CT

Although me and all my players have either a technical PhD or are 
working at it, I really do not like to think that somebody able to
travel FTL without violating causality has no better propulsion system
than reaction thrusters. I prefer to keep the infamous (almost)
reactionless drives of MT and mumble something about
reduced inertia to avoid people accelerating rocks to my planets.

On a different line, have the physicists in the audience looked at the 
paper by Algubierre (sp?) that describes a warp drive compatible with
general relativity? I guess it must have travelled FTL itself...
is that a 1st april joke arriving late?

I\'m guessing that at the distances ships normally operate at, Relativity
effects would be a pretty good defence against (what would in effect be)
very small, unguided missiles. Otherwise, just move your ship out of the

Naval blocade ( The bad guy\'s forces ), While finding out that there are
not one but two APB\'s out on us and our ship, one from the "bad" guy
admril and one signed by the Arch Duke himself - Yikes now we have to
try to run for it!
Meanwhile Narius calls a psycologist to make an appointment, The psyc
figures that she has a VERY disturbed person on her hands makes an
appointment for the next day. We where all mystified and figured that he
would show up with one of us under his arm. But no he asked "My Lord"
Gunnar for permission to leave the ship in order to take care of some
personal business, on being given permission he leaves and goes to the
psyc, he tells her that members of his order are not allowed to sleep
with weapons of mass destruction as to many incidents have happened
because of their dreams, and he is suffering from a particullary
horrible dream... He is in a room there is a table on the table is a
bowl of soup and a spoon. He sits down and starts eating the soup, no
deamons appear from the soup, nothing attacks him all is peacfull as he
eats his soup! This is so bad that he hasn\'t slept for three weeks!
( No wonder he has been a little twichy ). The psyc is just flabergasted
but manages to keep it together as she realizes that he belongs to a
ship and this VERY disturbed indivual is not a resident on her planet!
She gives Narius a referance to a sound enviroment expert figuring that
that might help him sleep. He thanks her and leaves, Pay... well that never
entered his mind...
Any why the upshot of all fo this is Narius not only has a sound system
to rival most colusiums! as well as smell. When pay was requested Narius
looked puzzled then said oh yes; see our quatermaster ( our Purser
Astrid). He runs a battle field gunpowder smells etc. when he wants to
sleep. I can\'t wait for him to either open his door or turn it up some
night Gunnar will wake up painting the bulkhead with the lazer sight of
his favorite .50 hand gun...
Oh yeah no fights this time, but I have the feeling that we will be
boarded during the next seession...
That one could be interesting, I\'ve never seen THIS crew completely
freed to "GO FOR IT" I\'d almost pity the boarding party...
Ok Ok go back to lurk mode now you\'ve babbled on far to much...
( to much coffee )
Good Night

I\'ve thought a bit about including gauss spinal mounts before, but there is a

serious problem.  Unless the projectile is highly relativistic, by the time
it
gets there, the ship will be gone if its made any course change at all.  With

the ranges involved in combat, the projectile would have to be going a
sizeable
fraction of the speed of light.  Even travelling at 0.1c, it has gained 0.5
percent of its rest mass in kinetic energy.  For a 1kg projectile, this is 
4.5e14 joules.  Firing one projectile in a turn would require a continuous 
power drain of 250,000 MW.  Even at this speed, targeting is significantly 
harder than lasers and particle weapons because the travel time is so long, 
and its a single projectile.  The obvious thing to do is to fire many smaller
projectiles, maybe in the milligram range, perhaps just shoot iron filings.
At 0.5c, the targeting wouldn\'t be as much of a problem.  To fire 10 in a 
turn, like the standard lasers and PAWS, given a 10,000 MW input at 100%
efficiency, you\'ve only created 0.2 grams of mass IN A TURN.  That makes 20mg
per projectile.  Given a gamma of 2 (0.86c), this makes the projectile 20mg, 
because at a gamma of 2, the kinetic energy is equal the rest energy.
KE=mc^2(gamma - 1).  20mg is pretty small... for iron it would be about 
three cubic millimeters.  The magazine weighs just about nothing, you could 
carry billions!  The problem is only power required.  A big advantage of
these
things is they can\'t really be stopped by any screen.  A really strong
magnetic
field might do something, but the power drain would be utterly unfeasable.
Your only hope would be to detect by active EMS and dodge... yeah right!

I think the idea sounds great. After some of the heated discussions which
have
appeared, and reappeared lately, it could save on some bandwidth.

Few people would have the time to create this on their own (I wouldn\'t) but
perhaps if people were to send their FAQ topics into one central person, and
that person just collates them it might be possible. 

Would MPGN be willing to carry it at their FTP site, and make it available 
via the listserver?

To make it useful, it would probably need to contain a summary of the
discussion, particularly its outcomes and the major points covered. That way
if someone felt they had something new to add, they could confirm it quickly
and easily.

My first suggestion for a topic would be a TNE product list with scheduled 
release dates for future items.

What you do is you build it into a large asteroid - when you need more

There is such a list on MPGN\'s ftp site.  (GDW.pricelist or something 
like that...)

Some things to add to the FAQ:

-FTP, WWW and gopher (or any other Online resources)
-Mailing-lists (GDW-beta, TNE-Pocket etc) information
-Reviews (past (Classic & mega) and present(TNE)) of GDW products by 
 members of TML (ie: Aliens of the Rim)
-Errata location
-Rumors and offical GDW policy (Loren\'s part)
-Recommanded Stores for Traveller Products around the world by TML members.
-Challenge\'s submission guides
etc...

What do you all think?

     The American who led the revolt in Nicaraugua, and installed 
himself as leader, was named William Walker, and did so in the 1850\'s 
which led to the first armed intervention of US forces there.  He was 
backed by Cornelius Vanderbilt, who did indeed desire the rights to 
build a canal there, linking the Atlantic and Pacific.

     Panama\'s independence was from Colombia, and while it was 
covertly funded by the US, and was plotted by local businessmen and 
officials of the Panama Canal company in response to Colombia\'s 
refusal to grant rights to the land to build the canal, it had nothing to 
do with the earlier events in Nicaragua.

Steve, I of course, like the designs.  But I think you are not
using the correct basis for comparison.  DV is probably not the
best component of these weapons to hold constant.

I think you\'d get a more accurate comparison by keeping DISCHARGE
ENERGY constant.

This way your laser would shrink drastically in size.  I expect
that at TL 15 it would be the smallest, cheapest (both important)
weapon of the three, and (at least against ships that aren\'t
giant floating sandcaster platforms) the most effective.  It\'s
DV will be less, but it\'s PV will probably be higher.

Ok, ask and ye shall recieve.  Here\'s a rework of the laser and 
a return of the PAWS weapon, DE constant at 250 gigajoules, and
effective range constant at 2400 Mm.  You\'re right, the results
*are* interesting: 

TL15 250-GJ Laser Lance
----
Volume:  45088 kL    Mass: 88831 metric tons
Power:    6944 MW    Crew:     1
Surface Area:  5.3 sq. meters
Price:  MCr 703.3
10:1/400-1250  20:1/400-1250  40:1/400-1250  80:1/400-1250

Now let\'s compare this with the competition, the PAWS that I
previously posted:

TL15 250-GJ PAWS Spinal Mount
----
Length:  500 meters
Volume:  44360 kL     Mass: 87953 metric tons
Power:    6944 MW     Crew:     1
Surface Area:  2.4 sq. meters
Price:   MCr 497.8
10:2500  20:2500  40:2500  80:2500

*Very* interesting.  They\'re about the same size, but the laser 
costs 1.4 times more.  The PAWS is a better deal against ships
with armor of 1253 or less because it\'s cheap and does as much
or more damage than the laser.  Against ships with armor factors
heavier than that, the laser\'s massive penetration makes it the
better choice, since then it does more damage than the PAWS. 
Again, modifying the PAWS for rapid fire beyond -2 Diff Mod will
require less volume than doing it to the laser, which might be
another reason to pick the PAWS instead.  Of course, the laser 
still has no length requirement.

Thanks for all the information concerning gauss weapons being used in ship to
ship combat but that was never my intention in the first place.  The easiest
way to cause damage in space combat using physical weapons IMHO is to fire
fletchette warheads mounted on space missiles at the target.  There is quite
a good discussion on this in the gdw-beta list from which I formulated my own
set of rules for impact missiles.
Electro-mag catapults were really intended to provide in-system transfer and
planetary launch capabilities.  Because of this, I am rating them in terms of
g-turns and providing incidental rules for planetary bombardment.  My
inspiration here is the 2300 AD "Nyotekunda (sp?) Sourcebook" which includes
an adventure set on the "Andrw Carnegie", a 1400m electro-mag catapult.
Has any one else noticed the length rules for spaceships produce very squat
shapes?  I allow spinal mounts to extend beyond the length of a spaceship
with the same disadvantages that having a folding EMS array extended gives.
This also allows improvements to PAs and meson gun performance, which is a
good
thing IMHO.  I am considering getting rid of laser focusing purely because
big
lasers are SO good.

    'body' => 'While sorting out some papers in my room this morning I found
a copy of an adventure I wrote a few months ago, which I sent
off to GDW. I never got any reply from them, so I assume they
don\'t want it. Still, it\'s not too bad, so I thought the TML
might appreciate a brief summary of it. 

Background
Austin Gray is an extremely wealthy and greedy man. For many years he was a 
member of the crew of a far trader, drifting from system to system, trying to

make ends meet. Until one day, when while his fellow crewmembers were running

sensor checks at (I used New Martham/Thoezennt), prior to jumping back out of

the system, an anomalous reading was picked up from a small moon orbiting the

system\'s gas giant. The ship\'s launch was dispatched to investigate. They
found 
a small naval depot that had been heavily bombed in the war. The radiation 
levels were barely tolerable, but the damage to the communications and 
sensor equipment had protected what remained from Virus infection. Several 
warehouses remained intact, containing parts for starship fusion plants and 
weapon systems. There was far more than would fit on board the trader, so
ther 
crew abandoned their planned trade route and returned to Aubaine to stake a 
finder\'s claim.
Back on Aubaine, Austin arranged for the other member\'s of the crew to meet
with 
a tragic accident in a grav vehicle malfunction, leaving him sole recipient
of a 
claim worth hundreds of megacredits. Not satisfied to retire with the money,
he 
started to think of ways to make even more.
His time in the wilds eventually provided inspiration. He had seen how small 
numbers of high tech troops could allow a TED to rule, so he reasoned that 
others would pay well for the services of similar mercenaries, to swing the 
balance of power in their favour. This left him with one further problem, a 
mercenary unit such as he envisaged would require a starship for support and 
transport, but the only ones available were battered relic ships, as the 
Coalition had control of the shipyards and all new ship construction.
He decided to trick the Coalition into building the ship he wanted. He wrote
a 
clause into his will, stating that on his death, the Coalition would inherit
his 
fortune, on the one condition that it was used to construct a ship as a
memorial 
to him, from ship plans he commissioned himself. He then staged his own death

(lost at sea on Aubaine, no body recovered). This was done to prevent the 
questions that would be asked if he donated the money while still alive, and
it 
prevents him from being a suspect when he steals the ship from the RC.
After his \'death\', the Coalition was only too happy to add another ship to
its 
fleet, and so the Dark Century class Frontier Cruiser was constructed. As the

adventure begins, the Coalition is recruiting the finest crew it can for the 
Century\'s shakedown cruise.

Outline of plot:
Part one. The characters report to the Wet docks on Aubaine for a briefing, 
where they first see the Century (my design was 900t to minimise signiture,
was 
EMM masked, maximised use of passive sensor arrays and carried a 2000Mj
particle 
accelerator). During the night, the characters follow a mysterious figure,
who 
leads them on a wild goose chase around the dock facility before disappearing

again. The characters witness the theft of the Dark Century from the dock,
and 
within seconds are arrested for their alleged part in the theft. It soon
becomes 
clear to the characters that they are being framed by the head of security,
who 
is in the pay of Austin. The characters escape from the docks so that they
can 
gather the evidence to clear their names.

Part two. Forced to live under cover after being framed for the theft of the 
Century, the players research the security man\'s past and discover links to a

lead engineer on the project, who was paid large sums of money. The
characters 
beg, borrow or steal transport to an exclusive holiday resort island, where
the 
engineer is guarded. A raid on the house reveals evidence of his, and the 
security head\'s part in the theft, clearing the players. The players are
given 
command positions on a mission to recover the Dark Century.

I\'ll leave it up to you as to where you take it from here, as this developed

First, I hope this is not a FAQ - if it is, I apologise now.

I am after some help with FF&S Flight Avionics vs Navigational Aids.

Both the avionics and the nav aids have their usage described on p48, 
para 1. However, a few points seem to have been glossed over. Could 
someone help with answers to the following questions:

1. If a craft has avionics, does it need (another set of) nav aids? Or, 
is it assumed that the one set of gear can do both jobs?

2. Why are the descriptions (slightly) different?

3. The following stats are different in the two tables:
   - Mag compass tech level
   - Gyrocompass cost
   - Transponder cost
   - IPS cost and power
   - IGS Positioning cost and power
  Is this deliberate? Does the higher cost come from the "extra features" 
mentioned in the avionics table?? If so, why don\'t the other stats differ?

4. Is "Integrates IGS positioning" (nav aid table) meant to read simply 
"IGS Positioning" or "This integrates IGS Positioning into the earlier 
features shown"??

I have looked thru the errata available to me, and couldn\'t see this 
mentioned.

I have been a lurker on the list for about four months now and have thoroughly
enjoyed the discussions - even if most of the Physics has been way over my head
:-)

A few weeks ago I posted a question regarding how PCs aquire starships when they
are created.  I got not a single answer :-(

Well, if at first you don\'t succeed, and all that, so here it is again ... 

I have a question on initial starship aquisition when a character is being made.
I don\'t have my books in front of me, so the exact wording won\'t be right but:

When a group of characters are first created they can pool together their
ship DMs.  They then roll on the [first of the two tables] table and see how
many minus DMs they get to allot to their ship - assuming they don\'t end up
with High or Middle Passages.  For example lets assume they end up with -16 DMs
to allot (the worst case).

They must then work these DMs off as either modifiers to the Ships Type table
roll (table two on the page), or modifiers on the wear of the ship (up to
-10) or modifiers on the amount of money outstanding on the mortgage (up to -8).

The problem lies in the Ship Types table.  If they are taking a Scout ship, what
is to stop them using up all 16 negative DMs on this table.  They are bound
to end up with a Scout ship anyway, and this way have no DMs to work off as wear
or as outstanding repayments - they get a brand new, completely paid up scout
ship!

Possible solutions I have thought of:

1) The players must state how many DMs they wish to use on this table before
they roll the dice.  Then, if the total score rolled on the Ship Types table is
less than -2 they get no ship at all.  So the most negatives they can risk
sensibly are -4.

2) They first roll the dice and then state how many minuses they wish to work
off (to a maximum adjusted roll of -2).  I like this solution the least as it
is very contrived.

How do the rest of you deal with this problem (or am I missing some rule which
neatly explains it all) ?

Thanks very much.  I wait in hope of a reply this time ... :-)

Pete.

How about 50-ton heavy fighters mounting a miniature spinal mount weapon?
The fighters get in close and punch lotsa holes into the big ungainly
battlewagons.  Of course, the defenders counter with lots of little fighters
armed with even smaller gauss autocannon (flying CIWS defense pods), so
the 50-ton fighters also need gauss autocaoon of their own to counter.

It could rapidly get silly, but would certainly add a more WWII naval combat
flair to space.battles.  Feels like some of the space battles described in the
"Golden Age" SciFi novels (Heinlein, Asimov, Piper, etc).

Hello,

I was intersted to know if anyone ever attempted to design a generation 
ship for Traveller (Classic/Mega/TNE).  A ship that would travel at 
sub-light speeds for very long periods of time (tens or hundreds of years) 
and sustain the life of the crew (crew size around 5,000 10,000 maybe?)

What hull size would fit it and what the important parts of a ship like 
that would be?  What Tech level then?  Tl 7,8 or higher?

If there are any designs like that, please DO post them...

Thanks,

So maybe Traveller fighters will finally stop looking like F-15s and start
looking like A-10 tankbusters! Boy, will the Wisconsin National Guard look
foolish now that its finally given up its Warthogs for F-16s! :-)

what 
sort of effect this might have on personnel? Should the number of damage dice
be 
greater than the damage value (as for lasers)? I can\'t find any references to

meson guns being used in versions this small and there may be a good reason,
but 
the possibility of an Intrepid Grav Tank being neutralised by a sniper seems 
interesting.

I\'m not completely sure if this would work at all. I\'ve no idea what the
recoil 
would be like, whether there\'d be a need for radiation shielding, etc.

Also, I\'ll get round to posting the \'Dark Century\' which I described in my

the 
moment, and I\'ll post the two together.

I would rather say, it depands on what you are designing.  As was said

preformance..

I guess, the best way is to use your judgement in each case by it\'s 
self.  The reliability of the design might go up too (Better preformance 
tests to detect flows in the design, etc..), less maintance etc...

Congrats on joining the New Era!  Hope you\'ll have fun..

The best product to get if you wish to design anything (Starships, 
vehicles, weapons etc.) is Fire, Fusion & Steel (product no. 0304) by 
GDW.  Brilliant Lances\'s design rules are pre-FF&S, therefore, there are 
differences between the two rule sets.

Did you upload the program yet?  I am very intersted in seeing it.  
Please let me (and anyone else on the list know) when and if you do.

     This probably would have little effect on vehicles, but the effect on 
     the crew 
     inside would probably be more significant. Does anyone have any ideas

     interesting.

Notes:

The Interstel I-1102 was a ubiquitous design throughout the Solomani
Confederation and adjoining areas, serving much the same purpose as the
Imperial Type S Scout/Courier.  The I-1102 is an evolutionary design,
building on the TL-13 I-1101 and the TL-12 I-1100. The current version of
the venerable Solomani Scout entered service shortly after the Solomani
Patriotic War (Solomani Rim War), gradually replacing the I-1101 in active
service over the next century.  The craft is also popular with private
organisations, particularly corporations seeking an inexpensive courier /
executive transport.

The I-1102 was produced in huge numbers by the Solomani Confederation, and
saw extensive service during the Retribution War (2nd Rim War / Solomani
Invasion) from 1117.  This ship, and the \'Victrix\' class multipurpose sloop
are by far the most common relic ships to be found in the New Era, the sheer
numbers produced ensuring the survival of some ships following the Collapse.

The Near Bootes Commonwealth operates a number of these craft - their high
tech communications and sensor equipment are prized by planetary and
Commonwealth organisations alike.  The Solomani Scout is the vessel most
likely to be encountered beyond the Commonwealth\'s borders, operated by the
CEF.

Stauffenburg und Warne, a small shipbuilder on Aquitaine, plans to restart
production of the I-1102, using TL-12 equipment where needed.  The first
example was laid down on 057-1102, and is expected to be completed by year\'s
end.

Rules of thumb: - Don\'t visit worlds more than 4 sized over your homeworld
                - Size 6+ people can visit most places without too much loss
                - Watch out for higher-than avg density worlds!

This problem was raised earlier in the gdw-beta list server, and the
recommend-
ation was to use a multiplier to weapon size equal to the difference between
light and heavy focal array lasers.
This does not make portable meson guns much less powerful, but the argument
died
down when someone clarified that all meson weapons required beam pointers.
Your
design seems to have raised this problem again.

While the discussion is on battledress, I would like to point out my
battledress
designs kick butt over anything that GDW has published.  Why?  I install fuel
cells rather than batteries, which have between 1/3 and 1/10 the listed mass
of
the batteries used in the battledress designs in FFS.  The extra space
savings
I use to install stealth or EMM, extra weapons, cybernetics (Yes, from
chapter
12), and other equipment, inluding tool kits.  This gives a much wider
variety
of design possibilities and lets me beef up the armour by a factor of 3 or 4.
Oh, and because fuel cells generate heaps of excess power because of their
minimum volume, they are ideal for installing DEI lasers, gauss weapons, and
in
this case meson guns. (Which I had not previously thought of).

 Here are the details:

DV at all ranges:2

Although this is a ffs design, it is by no means a conventional use of the 
design sequence, it\'s more an exercise in \'What if?\', which is why I\'m 
interested to hear people\'s opinions about it. There are certain unaddressed 
questions in scaling between starship sized weapons and small arms, such as 
recoil, effectiveness of a beam pointer, and damage scaling. I cannot see why

lasers should be unique in being more damaging to personnel than vehicles,
after 
all, the average rifle only delivers a few thousand joules of energy and is 
still apparently more damaging than this weapon. 
 
Even if the damage isn\'t increased, the distraction to the pilot of a vehicle

flying at low level could still prove effective.

    'body' => 'On the whole, I quite like the system presented in \'Path of Tears\' to
determine the size of military forces for a world/nation.  However, I have
one modification that I\'d like to seek comment on:

As technological sophistication increases, armed forces tend to become more
and more expensive to equip, train, maintain and wage war with.  Given the
complexity of the equipment that he operates, the average soldier today
would, to paraphrase Heinlein, rate a master in most other trades...well
maybe not quite, but it\'s getting there.

So, as an army/navy/air force becomes more advanced, it tends to get smaller
(after all, there\'s only so many defense credits to go around).  

As an example, in the First World War, the Australian Infanty Force was able
to send (very rough half-remembered guess) 12-14 divisions to the
battlefields of the Dardanelles and France.  The AIF was (near the end of
the war), organised as a seperate field army under the Imperial Supreme
Command.  In the Second World War, we fielded a smaller number (I think it
was 11 divisions - including the home defense units), of which only four or
five divisions were trained and equipped for combat (they fought well...but
that\'s another story).  Today, the Australian Army could barely scrape
together a division...including Army Reserve and Ready Reserve troops.

Similarly, I read somewhere that the US Army fielded 89 divisions in
WWII...I don\'t know how many it fields now, but I\'d be surprised if it were
more than a dozen.  Then there were the massive combats on the Eastern Front
- Germany invaded the USSR with 150 divisions....who could afford to equip
that many soldiers with todays weaponry?

Anyway, my idea is to take the final manpower figures produced by the Path
of Tears system, and multiply them by a Tech Level modifier as follows:

TL      Mod.
--      ----

0-2     x2.0
3       x1.0
4       x0.8
5       x0.6
6       x0.5
7       x0.4
8       x0.3
9-10    x0.25
11+     x0.2

These are \'top of the head\' figures....and don\'t take into account
governments that may choose to equip reserve or militia units below their
current tech level.  At TL 11 and beyond, the rapidly falling cost of power
generation offsets the increased cost of the equipment itself, leading to a
\'levelling out\'.  Any comments/suggestions welcome.

FYI

The McDonnel Douglas built Delta Clipper Experimental Vehicle successfully
completed a 123.6 second flight yesterday above White Sands Missle Range in
New Mexico.  Flying at a constant angle, the prototype reached an altitue of
1340m and traveled a lateral distance of 350m.  It landed vertically at its
landing site 107m from its launch site.  Three additional test flights are

>  Notes on how Gravity weakens characters, depending on homeworld

2300AD has a different scheme; strength is reduced in higher-G environments,
but dexterity is reduced in *lower* G environments. Apparently, people get
clumsier in lower gravity...

[ This is from memory; apologies for errors ]

2300AD uses 4 ranges: zero-G, low-G, earth-normal, and high-G. The base
strength/dexterity of your character (the ones calculate/roll) are entered
under the column representing your birth environment. Then, there\'s a chart
that raises/lowers the values for the other gravities:

Strength Modifiers:            Dexterity Modifiers:
          current gravity                current gravity
birthG   zero low  norm high   birthG   zero low  norm high
============================   ============================
zero       0   -1   -2   -4    zero       0   +1   +2   +4
low       +1    0   -1   -2    low       -1    0   +1   +2
normal    +2   +1    0   -1    normal    -2   -1    0   +1
high      +4   +2   +1    0    high      -4   -2   -1    0

IMHO, High gravity shouldn\'t affect any other attributes. A character
spending alot of time in high relative gravity should have to make regular
endurance checks (Their endurance isn\'t reduced, it\'s just used).
Intelligence, Wisdom, Education, etc. have no relation whatsover to current
gravitational stresses, and shouldn\'t be affected.

One minor point, you are comparing a peacetime situation (today) to a war
situation (WWII).  Just before WWII, the US Army was 150,000 men.  During
WWII the US Army was 8,000,000 strong (although about 50% of those men
were in non-combat positions, ie supply).  And today the US Army has
around 550,000 men.

    'body' => 'Alvin Plummer recently suggested a way to implement the effects of high
gravity
on characters, which GDW doesn\'t realy cover.  I have also recently
atteempted to deal with this issue, which breaks down into two areas:
The physical effects of high gravity.  This increases the weight of objects
nad\\and the speed at which they fall.
The physiological effects of high gravity.  This results from the increase in
weight of the character\'s own body.  A 80 kilogram person in a 1.2 G field
hasanextra 20 kilograms (Actually 200 N) of weight for their body to deal
with.
This does not just affect actual strength, but reaction time, health and
possibly intelligence.
GURPS Space has one way of dealing with this, by treating the extra weight by
additional encumberance.  Another way is to apply excess Gs as fatigue.  I
recommend 1 automatic level of fatigue for every 0.2 Gs over 1 G.  The
fatigue
rules already deal with most of the secondary effects of this.  A third way
is to divide STR, CON, AGL, and INT by the gravity in Gs in high gravity
areas.
Load, throw range and unarmed combat damage should be divided by local
gravity
squared, and includes the afore-mentioned effects on actual object weights.
This
method requires more calculations, but allows character sheets to be
permanently
adjusted and then adjusted back later.
Personal movement should be adjusted as vehicle movement already is, using
the
10/20/30 walk/trot/run rates as the safe movement speeds for characters.  One
aspect of vehicle movement not covered in the basic Traveller: The New Era
rules
is the reduction in speeds because of increased vehicle weights.  Divide
ground
and ACV vehicle top (triple overdrive or run) speed by the local gravity in
Gs
in high gravity.

which had 4 divisions (6th, 7th, 8th, 9th).  I don\'t know the 
number or size of units serving in Australia during the wars.  It 
has harder to equip the 2nd AIF than the first due to a lack of 
equipment.  The 8th Division was lost when Singapore fell and 
was never replaced.

A trend during the WWII was to reduce the size of units as the 
firepower of equipment increased.  This resulted in smaller 
divisions late in the war with the same firepower as divisions at 
the start.  One method could be to create the same number of units 
from path of tears but make the number of people in the units 
smaller.

The mass combat system in world tamers produces a combat factor 
for each unit depending upon size and tech level.  If combat 
factors where used a world could produce so many combat factors 
per population which would result in smaller units at higher tech 
levels.

The thing I believe is missing hear is signature modifiers for
different sizes and types of powerplants. It should be hard enough to
hide in battledress without lighting up every enemy sensor suite in
the area due to excess heat. Anyone got any rules for this? This could
be useful for vehicles and spacecraft also. Combine this with rules
for thruster exhaust heat and many designs become prime targets...

I think it should be lowered in *both* - just try strapping weights to your
arm and then signing your name!

I suppose this is as good a place as any to ask this:

If someone moved to a higher-G world, or turned up the gravity on their
ship, would this eventually increase their STR?

No.  Traveller:2300, which was later re-named 2300AD, is another,
completely different game.  Originally released as Traveller:2300, and
renamed to 2300AD in the second printing, this game has no relation to
the Traveller product line - it uses its own rules sustem (although there
is some similarity to the Twilight:2000 system) and the official game
universe is set in the Twilight:2000 history, 300 years after events
described in Twilight:2000.

The game is interesting in its own right, and has a number of ideas that
are worth exploring - one of the most interesting is the "stutterwarp" FTL
drive (a nice new name for an old FTL drive concept), and the three
dimensional starmap and interstellar navigation.

Compared to what?

Certainly, using the pre-made "official" universe is easier: the background
data is already created for you, and you can pick up suppliments and
adventure materials and use them directly, without modification.

However, Traveller: The New Era has good support for "created" (or perhaps I
should say, "create-your-own") universes.  The technology rules in the Fire,
Fusion, and Steel suppliment offer several alternatives, so that variant
universes are relatively easy to define.  The world-generation rules in the
main rulebook are easily adaptable to whatever kind of starmap you wish to
create, as well.

On the other hand, be prepared to spend more time on your game that a
referee using the "official" universe would: for example, if the players
decide to visit a local government offical, you\'ll need to decide who that
might be, and create any supplimental material you will need to manage the
encounter.

Particularly when running a "create-your-own" campaign, it\'s vital to keep
notes.  It\'s not hard to use the time between sessions to prepare materials,
but consistency is also important.  As you create material, file it in your
notes, and soon you will have a background of impressive detail.

You will find that you can also draft your players into assisting in the
creation of background detail.  For example, one of your players is playing
an ex-Navy character, and for some reason the players find themselves aboard
a Navy ship.  It makes sense to detail the creation of the Naval ship to the
player of the ex-Navy character.  Not only does it ease the burden on the
referee, but it\'s realistic that the Navy character knows more about the
layout and capabilities of a Naval vessel than any of the other players.

Personally, I preferred the original.  Then again, I read Heinlien, Asimov
Clark, Niven, Dickson, Piper, and all the rest - so the game I want to play
mirrors the books I like to read.

> I\'m not that sure what you mean be "Space Fantasy" ---->  heroic quests,

A game that\'s combat oriented - involving heroes and a clearly defined
Good and Bad sides to a conflict.  Yes, _Star Wars_ is a good example of the
genre.

Don\'t get me wrong - not only do I like Star Wars, I enjoy the Space Fantasy
genre - but it doesn\'t require a game as large and complex as Traveller to
play it.  Games like West End\'s Star Wars RPG is more suited to this kind
of play, because the rules are simpler (both to learn and to use) which
keeps the action moving along, and the design emphasizes features of the
genre - for example, by making it easier for player-characters to survive.

If you want to play Star-Trek-like or Star-Wars-like games, Traveller: The
New Era isn\'t the right tool for the job.

"Realism" is very subjective, particularly when you\'re talking about a
science-fiction game.  In the opinion of the game\'s designers, T:TNE has a
realistic combat system, and many of the published scenarios involving
giving the player-characters a substantial technological advantage over
their opponents in order to help assure player-character survival.

In the opinion of other people who have played the game, T:TNE\'s combat
system is not realistic at all.  This is one reason why people tend to
either like or dislike the combat system - either you agree with the
designers\' opinions, or you disagree with them, but there is little middle
ground.

In my case, players of mine who are in a position to be familiar with the
way that modern military weaponry works have expressed their dissatisfaction
with the T:TNE combat system.  I respect their opinions, and don\'t agree
with some of the design choices made by the game\'s designers.

For me, yes.  FF&S concerns itself with the construction of all sorts of
weaponry and vehicles.  It will take a good bit of time to learn these
rules, and additional time to construct enough gadgetry for a
"create-your-own" campaign with a rich variety of weapons, vehicles, and
equipment.

The rules aren\'t so much an extension, but additional rules for topics not
covered in the main rules - construction of starships, space and air
vehicles, all types of weapons, and so on.  When finished, these designs
will produce numbers that can be used in the game rules, just like the
equipment that is provided with the game.

To me, the rules in FF&S are very important - designing materials for a
campaign is a large part of the fun of the game.

The space combat rules that appear in the T:TNE rulebook appear to be an
early revision of those that were published in Brilliant Lances.  They also
don\'t appear to have been playtested much (if at all).  Specific problems
include:

One-dimensional movement.  Rules for using maps and two-dimensional (yes, I
mean _two_) aren\'t provided, and support for two-dimensional maneuvering is
very limited.  Basically, all you have to work with is a range and a closing
velocity.

Botched Combat.  The rules as written call for ten attempts to hit the
target (and therefore at _least_ ten die rolls) per weapon per turn.  Combat
turns with what I considered a reasonable number of ships (an 800-ton
Broadsword-class mercenary transport against two 400-ton System Defense
Boats) involved nearly two hundred die rolls (120 "to-hit" rolls, plus
additional damage rolls for those which did hit).  This is too many die
rolls and too much time to be reasonable (and this is how I can tell
that the rules as written were not playtested extensively, if at all).

Limited Ship Selection.  There are a number of ships provided in the T:TNE
rules, however, there are no ship-construction rules, and the ships provided
are rather limited.  This is a Traveller tradition - typically only a few
starship designs were provided with earlier editions of the game - but T:TNE
is the first edition of the game (not counting _Starter Traveller_) which
lacks ship construction and customization rules in the basic rulebook(s).

Brilliant Lances fixes all these problems - it provides the starship
creation rules (an early draft of them; a few minor problems were corrected
when the same rules appeared in Fire, Fusion and Steel), good and playable
maneuvering and combat rules, and additional pre-designed starships.  It
is a good tactical-level, small-ship, space combat game in it\'s own right.

In my humble opinion, the game rules that were included with Brilliant
Lances, including the starship construction rules, _should_ have been
included in the T:TNE rulebook - in essence, equivalent rules were included
with the basic game in all previous editions of Traveller.  The additional
starships, maps, beautiful conters, and scenarios are quite properly the
province of a boardgame.

Is it
> skill or class based?  Why would one like or dislike them? (kinda dumb
question,
> I know :)).

Not dumb questions at all ...

The best way to describe the game system is that it is task based.  A task
describes the die roll required to succeed an attempted action.  Tasks are
classified into a set of difficulty levels (Easy, Routine, Difficult,
Formidable, Impossible), each of which has its own target number (rolled on
a d20).  The referee or the scenario sets the difficulty in terms of the
level.  Modifiers may change the difficulty level - there are no die-roll
modifiers.

The target numbers are computed from the character\'s skill, an attribute,
and the difficulty level (which determines a multiplier).  In general,
these targets can be pre-computed, so that there isn\'t a delay to figure
out the target number when a roll is called for.

Character\'s attributes (STRength, DEXterity [so I\'m a dinosaur - they call
it AGiLity now], ENDurance, INTelligence, EDUcation, and SOCial standing)
are generated randomly.  Characters gain skills through their education and
careers; generally selected by the player, with some random influences.
There is no "design" or "points" based character generation like that used
by some other game systems (such as GURPS and Champions).

The system is easy to explain to players, and isn\'t hard to use at all; it
has the advantage of simplicity.  However, I have a few strong dislikes.
The first is that attributes (generally STR, DEX, and to some degree INT and
EDU) have a great impact on the task target numbers.  This is because
attributes and skills contribute to the target number in equal proportion,
but attributes average around 6, while most characters have very few skill
levels that high.  The other thing I dislike is the relatively coarse
control over die roll - modifiers affect the task difficulty, so a +1
difficulty modifier represents a large change in the chance of success.

Problems with the combat system were generally mentioned above, however
I should also note that I personally found the combat rules needlessly
confusing - it\'s quite aparrent from reading them that the current rules
grew out of a much more compact rule-set that was repeatedly extended.
At the current state, it looks as if the rules have to remain the way they
are in order to maintain \'backward compatibility\' with earlier versions
of the rules (such as the infantry weapon versus heavy weapon confusion
that has aparrently confused more than one first-time player).

My biggest problem with it is that I\'d much rather they used SI (metric)
units, instead of pounds, feet, and yards.

Given this, I think that it\'s funny that STRIKER II includes many of the
things
(IMHO) that were missing from the first edition ie TO+Es for the Zhos, Imps
etc,
varied example vehicles and scenarios. (Of course they did rip the heart out
of it

seperately 
available).  At least they didn\'t try to sell it to us twice like the design
rules in 
BL + FF+S.

I hope that nobody takes this to be a criticism of STRIKER I (which I love).

I agree that it can turn out this way, especially if the published background
is 
accepted as rote. However, I think that the possibilities for ethical
dilemmas 
for players is still there in the New Era, it\'s just that we haven\'t seen
much 
that blemishes the RCES reputation (was it Operation Cosmic Fire that was 
criticised in the RC news?). Here are some ideas of how to prevent the game
from 
being one of black and white issues:

1/ Set up a campaign with the players as Guild members, but who believe that 
they are in the right, doing the only thing possible to keep interstellar 
commerce alive.

2/Have the characters subordinate to an RCES officer who is a brutal and 
vicious tyrant. Should they stage a mutiny? After all, he gets the job done.

3/Would it be correct to dispose a popular and benevolent dictator merely 
because he is a xenophobe, and the RC needs the world as a staging post?

4/Have rumours reach the players of nuclear weapons being used in some RC
strike 
missions. Should they interfere, or just keep on getting the job done? Is 
rebuilding civilisation more important than a hundred lives, or a thousand,
or 
even a million?

These ideas could really shake character\'s beliefs, particularly if they had 
previously felt that everything was just black and white.

1)
Not to start the TNE vs. CT/MT flamefest again, but has anybody noticed that
grav compensators seem to be useable as propulsion under FF&S?

The text states that G compensators provide an acceleration in the direction
opposite that of motion to lessen the amount of force on the people in the
ship.   I (personally) can\'t think of a reason that you couldn\'t use this
creatively.

1/  Who needs Anti-Hijacking programs?  When the ship *isn\'t* under
acceleration, what\'s to stop you from cranking your 6G Grav comsators on
full bore (after, presumabely, disabling the built in safety features) and
smashing everthing into the wall at 6Gs?  And, since this stuff has been
"shown" to be locally adjustable (ie, different rooms can either be on or
off, etc), you can just hole up in the bridge or your stateroom or whatever,
snug as a bug.

2/  Assuming that the artificial gravity/g compensator equipment actually
has to entirely enclose whatever it\'s acting on (thus keeping you from
planting a couple plates on the back of your ship and using \'em as
propulsion, a la CT Grav propulsion) instead of just being a plate in the
floor, what\'s to keep you from using this to make either mass-driver weapons
and/or mass-driver Ground To Orbit launch "guns"?


2) The description of PAWS in FF&S suggests that Traveller neutral particle
beam weapons are throwing Hydrogen atoms around.  Is there some reason that
by TL 12 or 13 they aren\'t throwing around AntiHydrogen instead?  Wouldn\'t
this be rather more effective as a weapon?  Granted, they wouldn\'t work as
well in an atmosphere, but the damage in space combat ought to be better,
with more radiation produced as well.

I  would  be  quite interested in hearing what (specific) criticisms people
have  with  the  Traveller:  The New Era combat system.  As an enthusiastic
rules  hacker,  I have finally decided the TNE combat system (Also Twilight
2000 and Dark Conspiracy) is actually quite bearable and usable compared to
a  lot  of  other  combat systems I have used.  Is the detail about various
military  systems terribly incorrect?  (My brother is joining the army in a
month  after  8  years  in army cadets.  He doesn\'t seem to mind it and has
acted  as  an  unqualified range instructor.  Heavy munitions were a little
out of the cadets league.)

May be this is just because I am used to the rules system.

This  is slightly incorrect.  Attributes and skill levels have equal impact
ONCE  the character has started developing a skill.  If a character has not
started   learning   a  skill,  each  point  of  attributes  has  half  the
contribution  of  a  single  skill  level.   This reflects the fact(?) that
innate  talent  is of great benefit early on when learning something, which
is how a skill system should work IMHO.  Having total success chances based
partly  on  attributes  means that fatigue (which reduces STR, AGL, CON and
INT)  and  serious  wounds  (which  halves  STR)  have a direct impact on a
character\'s  chance  to  perform  tasks.   The reverse argument is that low
attribute  characters are perhaps unnecessarily disadvantaged.  I\'m working
on it.

The  coarse  control  over the die roll only applies if you don\'t use finer
control,  such as modifiers to the attributes and skill level of the people
attempting actions.  The task system actually has a wide variety of ways of
controlling the die roll, including best of, worse of or average of several
skill  levels.   You  can  also  use  partial  diff  mods  (1/3, 3/4, 1.5).
Uncontrolled  recoil  is subtracted directly from the final success chance.
Melee  weapon  attack  modifiers  are applied directly to the final success
chance.   Equipment  (auto-meds,  binoculars) are applied directly to skill
mods.  This doesn\'t seem coarse control to me.

Yes.  I agree with you about combat needing editorial revision.  However, I
find combat relatively easy to run.  I prefer the slightly older initiative
system  that  was  used in the first printing of Twilight 2000 2nd edition,
and  Dark Conspiracy, which gives high-initiative folk a huge advantage and
really  discourages non-combatants getting involved.  Damage is simple, and
from  what  I  have  seen from an article in Challenge magazine (Admittedly
defending  the  system),  fairly realistic.  Just remember to use the quick
kill,  stun  and  knockdown rules and fights finish quickly too.  This way,
little  won\'t  stop  someone  (temporarily)  first  shot, but PC deaths are
infrequent  outside  of  a  military-type  environment.   It  gives  a  big
advantage to whoever starts shooting first as well :-).

As I said, it\'s mostly a matter of opinion.  Complaints included that the
small arms (in particular) weren\'t deadly enough, that the autofire system
was completely wrong as written, and other complaints.

Kevin McCarthy, if you\'re reading this, feel free to jump in; I\'m afraid
I didn\'t make a list of your comments and suggestions for T:TNE.

One of my personal complaints is that there doesn\'t seem to be any
significant advantage to most of the high-tech weapons (again, as written
in the T:TNE rules), leaving us wondering why they were ever adopted.

> May be this is just because I am used to the rules system.

This is possible.  Also, as I specifically mentioned; a _lot_ depends on
whether or not your find the system\'s designers\' arguments convincing.  GDW
has done their level best to design a good system; whether or not they
succeeded seems to me to be _highly_ dependent on one\'s own point of view.

When reviewing T:TNE (which is, in effect, what the reader from Poland was
asking), I felt that I should mention this characteristic of the game: most
people either like it (and feel that it is realistic, playable, or both),
or dislike it (generally stating that they don\'t feel it is realistic, or
that the game mechanics are intolerably awkward, or both).

Certainly, a _very_ large number of worse systems have been published.
As I mentioned in my comments (perhaps not prominently enough), it _is_
easy to explain and use, and this does count for a lot.

My persional opinion?  I\'m not fond of it (and never have been, since T2k
was published) and am not convinced that it\'s better than previous
Traveller systems.

Actually, assets are ALWAYS computed as (skill+attribute).  However,
unskilled task attempts are at a mandatory one level more difficult (which
does, indeed, halve the chances of success).

That is _NOT_ what I was referring to, however (see below), and I agree
that this _is_ how the system should work.

The same could be done by noting that fatigue and serious wounds cause
task difficulty modifiers, couldn\'t it?

THIS is what I see as the real problem with the system.  Not only are low
attribute characters "perhaps" (!) unnecessarily disadvantaged, but high
attribute characters are outrageously rewarded.

Again, however, the argument is one of philosophy: I feel that a character\'s
attributes shouldn\'t have this much effect over skill use.  The Classic
Traveller system was perhaps too far in the other direction (where
attributes had practically no effect on skills), while MegaTraveller\'s 
excellent skill/task system had this factor about right.

I feel that attributes should have a smaller overall effect, and that
a system where the contribution from skill and attribute should be in
an unequal proportion - favoring skill.

In practice, modifiers to the attributes and/or skill level of characters
attempting actions is done very rarely (some weapons and equipment have this
effect, but that is the only place it appears in the T:TNE rules). Similarly,
the uncontrolled recoil subtraction is (as far as I remember) the only time
the final success chance is directly modified in the T:TNE rules.  While
partial difficulty levels is mentioned in the rules, I have yet to see 
them used anywhere in the T:TNE, BL, FF&S, or RCEG rules.

While a good referee can use these and  many additional techniques (averaging
skills, calling for attribute-only or skill-only tasks, using "best of" and
"worst of" tasks, and liberal use of enabling tasks) to circumvent these
problems, I feel that in at least some (if not many) of the cases, the system
is working against me as a referee, instead of assisting me.

that\'s about how long you still have to return a response).  The biggest
effort here will be to insert unknown/non-respondent values into the
data fields, so that crosstabulations are possible (so I can answer
questions like "What\'s the most popular background for T:TNE players?").

Watch this space for further information.  :-)

While the number of people using the T:TNE rules isn\'t suprising, the
number who are playing in a Classic Traveller background is!  It is
clearly the most popular campaign background choice, even if all
three of the New Era campaigns are lumped into one category.

The "If I were running GDW" department:
  Given the above numbers (which were rather suprizing to me), and
  the large quantity of existing Classic Traveller background
  material accessable to GDW, a _We Have Always Been As We Are_ 
  Classic Traveller sourcebook for T:TNE might be the best choice
  for a new T:TNE product.  (some of you may remember Mike suggesting
  this title for such a book a while back).  How about it, Loren?

I should also note that most of the respondents refereed at least one game,
and so are much more likley to purchase suppliements and adventure modules
than the average T:TNE player.

Small arms have always been dangerous (Because of knockdown rules), but not
too  deadly.  Dead PCs have never been a strong point with my players.  The
autofire  system  needs  (Another)  overhaul  in  my  opinion.  There is an
article  in  Challenge  magazine  73,  "Lethality in Roleplaying Small Arms
Systems" which describes one set of Real World (tm) firefights taking place
on  the  US-Mexican border between a set of undercover police operatives in
the  area  and  various suspects.  While this is admittedly a statistically
small  sample  pool, it does make interesting reading and seems to bear out
GDW  house  system.   (But  then  Frank  Chadwick  wrote  it).

Most  of the roleplayed firefights in my experience of the GDW house system
are over within 30 seconds, with most combatants from one side knocked down
and  the  other  still  standing  (And  hence  able  to  maintain  tactical
superiority).   Least  satisfying  of all have been those fights which have
used  large  exchanges  of  automatic  fire,  if purely because it requires
getting  out  the rules again and handfuls number of dice.  There have been
some  statistically  unlucky  attempts  at autofire (Most memorably with an
AK-74  against  an COC eldar god).  The PCs have had vehicles shot out from
under them many times (It used to be horses in AD&D).

This  comment  made  me sit up in suprise.  I\'ll agree that the high-energy
weapons are still broken (Even with the article "Putting the Heat Back Into
Plasma"),  and  every so often someone designs a metre long meson gun.  The
design  sequences  in  FF&S  are continually going to need adjusting to fit
everyone\'s  real  world perception.  I would really like to get my hands on
GURPS Vehicles to check FFS against it.

But  what  sort  of  degree  of  difference  did  you envisage.  Lasers are
admittedly  not  as  penetrating  at  squad level as many roleplaying games
envisaged.   Blame physics.  Mass drivers and gauss weapons can\'t afford to
be  too  powerful  because of the limitations of recoil on muzzle energies.
High-energy   weapons   are  in  my  view,  sufficiently  powerful  enough,
especially  if  you  treat them like HEAP warheads as opposed to small arms
(But  I  blame  the  design  sequence here).  I can\'t see missles and other
warheads  getting  too  fundamentally  different  for  a  while,  short  of
miniature  nukes.   Admittedly.   GURPS  Ultratech does provide a wealth of
exotic  weaponary,  but then FF&S always lacked alternative technologies in
the  weapons  chapter  (Such  as  a  blaster design sequence).  I\'m waiting
patiently on Armour 21 as well.

I  don\'t  disagree  with  you.   Better  is always hard to achieve in a new
edition of a game.  The Traveller:  TNE system\'s main advantage in my eyes,
is its compatibility with Twilight and Dark Conspiracy, because I play both
these games as well.  The GDW house system at least covers all bases, tries
to  remain close to Real World (tm) and uses metric.  Everything else in my
opinion, is open to revision...

But  this would create the need for an extra rules.  One set how to explain
how fatigue and serious wounds affect attributes, the second to explain how
they affect task difficulties.

The  system  is  completely  open  to  such a modification.  Just determine
assets  using (1/2 attribute) + skill, or some other such alteration to the
rules.   Because the task system generally leaves such things alone (ie not
using  other assets as + or - modifiers and so forth) you can quite happily
do this.

The  problem  with  the  current  rules  is how to balance out high and low
attribute  characters.   My  players  tend to use characters from the upper
quartile  because  they  like  playing  cinematic games.  ie no one has STR
below  8.   If someone was to suddenly play a weak character in this group,
they would be at a serious disadvantage.

Many  game  systems  use  an talent/handicap system to balance out starting
characters.   One of the things that makes the GDW system different is that
it  does not impose such penalties on players (Otherwise if I play a blind,
anemic  dwarf,  I  can  get  an  extra  +2  INT).   Such  a system would be
relatively easy one to convert over, if need be.

GURPS restricts high attribute advantages, by limiting the attribute to 14.
Traveller  restricts high attributes to 15, but I relax this restriction to
say  there  is  no  maximum  attribute  (For  high-G characters, cybernetic
enhancements  etc).   If  this  becomes  unbalancing  (It  hasn\'t), I would
consider  limiting  higher  attributes to contributing only 15 to the skill
asset.   Similarly,  low  attributes  could  contribute  at least a minimum
amount to a skill, say 4, if less than 4.

What  do you mean _shooting first_?  Do you mean you want the PCs to adhere
to  a  code  of honour where they give the enemy the first shot?  Or do you
rather want to discourage PCs getting into shoot outs with people you would
rather they talk to.

My recommendation:

If  the PCs are getting into unnecessary fire fights, courtmartial them (In
the  RCES  or  Regency)  or  arrest  them.  This doesn\'t necessarily mean a
prison  term,  but  it  can  be  great for encouraging good behaviour and a
greater  degree  of  responsibility.   The  first  Dark  Conspiracy game we
played,  everyone  armed  up  with 4-5 guns and shot everything that moved.
After  the  police caught up with us during that adventure, we all cut down
to a pistol each and something heavier (Read shotgun) hidden in the trunk.

As  for  necessary  firefights,  shooting  first  has  always been the best
policy.

While  "defending"  the GDW system and specifically Traveller:  The New Era
(And I use this word in a loose sense), it occurred to me if much of what I
have  said  hasn\'t  been  argued  recently  on  one  of  the  rec.games.frp
newsgroups,  about  to  what  degree  games  are  homebrewed.  I agree with
comments about liking the TNE system being a matter of opinion and so forth
purely because I am so used to designing and throwing out rules as a matter
of  ad  hoc.   This  philosophy applies similarly to my adventures, which I
draw  from  any  game  system, provided the adventure has the basics (Maps,
handouts) and the plot to drive the players through it.

However,  I  think, ultimately, the trend these days is to chose one system
and  stick  with it, and for me, it will probably the GDW house system.  My
reason?   I  feel  GDW are closest to the gaming community when it comes to
explaining  why they made their design decisions, and recognising a mistake
when  they make one.  An interesting setting will always get my vote (Kult,
Call  of  Cthulhu  and Whispering Vault come to mind) and usually my money,
but  I\'ll  usually  leave  the  rules  for  it  on  the shelf and play with
something  I  already  know.   This  is not to say that GDW doesn\'t produce
interesting  settings  (and  2300  AD and Dark Conspiracy are two of my all
time favourites), nor other gaming companies good sets of rules.

This is probably also getting inappropriate for the Traveller Mailing List.

This is an *old* idea, from CT days. The best way of doing it is to have
a long corridor leading to the Bridge for them to \'fall\' down. If you\'re
really sick you can put spikes on the wall at the \'bottom\' or, (my
favourite) an airlock for them to \'fall\' out of...:-)

Initially, I was concerned about people having too many hit points (you
just couldn\'t *kill* people!), but the recent boosting of weapon damages
has helped this.

I\'m still not completely happy about a guy with a TL5 SMG turning the 
occupant of TL15 battle dress into puree through blunt trauma.

I *hate* the way armour works, (although not as much as I did).

I hate the way vehicle damage works differently to anti-personnel.

These help, but the whole thing could be simpler.

Hi, all,

This is the start of another Traveller auction. I\'m only posting this here
this one time. All future posts will be in rec.games.frp.marketplace.  But
tare some really choice items here -- including the Traveller Boardgames,
near-mint runs on the Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society (not to
mention JTAS #1), Paranoia Press and Games Workshop Traveller items and
FASA 15 mm starship deckplans  -- and I wanted people who\'d appreciate them
to know...

The two non-Traveller items are also neat: the four original Space Opera
books, and Stellar Conquest, Matagaming\'s 1979 space boardgame.

Rules come at the end of the auction, thanks for reading, and again, this
is the ONLY time this will appear here.

RULES AND REGULATIONS (a.k.a. SORAG is watching YOU!)
________________________________________________________________

Minimum bids are $2 for booklets, $3 for bagged items, $5 for boxed items.

Minimum bid increases are $1 for items under $25, $2 for items between $25
and $60, $3 for items above $60.

The auction will end June 21, but if bidding on some items slows down, I\'ll
consider using a "going, going, GONE" format so people won\'t have to wait
forever.

Buyouts will be considered. Fnord.

Since there\'s a lot of stuff here, bidding on groups is encouraged, but
must be greater than the sum of the individual bids to take the lot. I\'ll
also accept group bids on the entire auction.

If any bids come in on the same day that tie each other, the nod will go to
the first bidder that gets their offer into my e-mail. If I don\'t receive a
check, money order, or whatever for an item within two weeks of final
notification, the item will be offered to the next highest bidder. Please
let me know if you\'re going to be on vacation or out for whatever reason,
and we can make arrangements. If this doesn\'t seem fair, let me know, and
we\'ll hammer something out. Items will be mailed out once money orders
arrive or checks clear.

Buyer pays shipping, and chooses shipping method.

Send bids to muskrat@msn.fullfeed.com.

Regular updates will be provided via the net on rec.games.frp.marketplace,
and e-mail.

Indeed.  Some particularly creative players (myself included) set up
internal defenses on ships we were operating on to include things like
this sort of G-field manipulation (flipping gravity on and off, adding
high lateral accelleration with the compensators, etc.).  We also did
things like make sure we had large heavy objects available in special
compartments in the walls of most hull spaces, with centrally detachable
releases holding them in place.  What\'s worse than being bounced up and
down between 0 and 2 gees?  Doing so with a bowling ball in the room.

It takes very little money to design in more active defenses into
starships, and they keep coming up as useful in MY games, so ... 8-)

I\'ve been thinking about this, and I think they are wrong.  I remember when
the Imperium was young (and so was I) the Zhodani were evil, but then we
learned that they really weren\'t.  Similarly, I suspect that GDW is setting
the Coalition up for a nice moral crisis.  In fact, the seeds of several are
there already:

1) The dictator of Kal is more liberal than his people.

2) Oriflamme is not a democracy, at least not in power structure.  It is also
a strongly chauvanistic society, and seemingly able to justify anything with
"we suffered terribly in the past, but never again".

3) The Coalition seems intent on exporting _their_ version of democracy to
the stars, as if it is the best form of government.  

4) The Coalition\'s economy is based on loot.  Ideally cold recovery, but
there is strong popular support for SAG raids ("we need this worse than you
do").  The rights of Coalition citizens come ahead of the rights of others,
even outside the Coalition.  

Sure, most of the adventures pubblished so far have been military ones, with
the players being the "good guys".  But there seems to be a lot of scope for
moral dilemmas if that\'s what your players want.

I re-read the Challenge 73 article, and I have some problems with it.  
While it is an accurate reflection of the chances to hit with a weapon, 
especially a handgun - even trained individuals miss more often than they 
hit, even at close range - the description of weapon damage is flawed.  
Most of the hits described in the articles are from police pistols firing 
relatively low-velocity rounds that are not hollowpoint or some other 
form of expanding bullet.  In tests that I have read about, this is exactly 
the type of round that has a low chance of lethal damage.  Rounds that 
fragment or expand, like hollowpoint bullets, or high velocity rounds 
that hit bone and tumble or shatter, do far more damage.  The reason is 
simple: a bullet that expands or breaks into multiple fragments destroys 
more tissue and transfers more energy to the body being hit.  Frank\'s own 
article bears this out - look how much more lethal shotguns (multiple 
projectiles in a single round) are than the pistols as a percentage of hits.

Many things went on at Unseen Univeristy and, regrettably, teaching had to be
one of them. The faculty had long ago confronted this fact and had perfected 
various device for avoiding it. But this was perfectly all right because, to
be

     Title:  _Igniting the Reaches_
     Author: David Drake

     Publisher: ACE
     Damage: $4.99US ($6.50CAN)

     Review:

     My first impression was that David Drake is a Traveller player,
heart and soul, from the earliest days of classic Traveller.  His prose
in _Igniting the Reaches_ is different from that of his "Hammer\'s Slammers"
genre in subtle ways.  I think that the desperation he creates in the
psyche of his characters is very convincing.  The closest Slammers works
to the power of this new text are _The Sharp End_ and _The Warrior_; if you
liked those, you\'ll love this one more...
     My second impression was that Drake has exactly the same b*tch*s about
TNE that we do, not to paint with TOO broad a brush. [sarcasm]  _Reaches_
is set after the collapse of interstellar civilization, the cover blurb says
a millenium, but the design artist types never get the facts right anyway,
(but it sure as h*ll beats a 70 year recovery from total techological
collapse)
however the cover art on the paperback is superb.  Drake uses a stutterwarp-
style drive, and lavishes detail upon the difficulties of insterstellar,
three-
dimensional astrogation (for those of you out there who claim that the
universe
isn\'t flat, no matter what GDW says).
     My third impression was that Drake\'s combat scenes have only gotten
better
as he ages.  The two main characters, Stephen Gregg and Piet Ricimer, are
"traders" in the expansive definition of Sir Walter Raleigh (Drake\'s
"Author\'s
Note" lays claim to great inspiration from _Haykluyt\'s Voyages_, circa 1598).
The two characters are very nicely dynamic, well-fleshed, and vivid.  (I wish
all PCs had such rich backgrounds and depth of "character" - all puns are the
fault of the limitations of the English language.)
     My last impression was that Drake spent a lot of time considering the
ramifications of his interstellar technology, optics, the limitations of
inferior systems, but he felt compelled to keep in silly 16th Century-style
cannon ports and plasma cannon to be run out of them to be fired!  He does,
however, put a very interesting twist on the difficulties involved with using
autoloaders when automated mass-production is at a premium...  I have some
ascetic objections to the Molts (Drake\'s "magic wand" per se), but I prefer
them to gravitic technology (um, there\'s no relation there folks).  I like
very much his graphic detail on the use of plasma/ion thruster technology,
and I hope one of you physics/engineering types out there will work up a 
materials table for me on the ceramic technology he uses for some of the
non-metallic starship hulls!

     Recommendation: *****
     Buy it.  Read it.  Love it.  It will add a new dimension to any 
campaign, New Era (RC), Third Imperium (cT), or New Era (Regency).  Please
forward flames of _Reaches_ to me personally, as I would be VERY interested
to see what if any objections there are to rating this a first class book.
(I wish GDW would hire the likes of Drake (fiscal considerations aside) to
write their novels...  After those reviews, I\'ve been hesitating to buy
_Death
of Wisdom_.)

It\'s the time of year around here where people start getting ready to
go on their summer vacations.  So here\'s a vehicle which could be used
in several ways for a Traveller character\'s vacation: 


Boeing "LRV" Lunar Roving Vehicle
----

    "The Boeing LRV "Lunar Rover" was built for the United States of 
 America for use in the initial, tentative exploration of Luna in the
 mid twenty-sixth century pre-imperial.  Only three examples of this
 exact vehicle were landed on the moon, but the design may have had 
 an influence on the scouting rovers used to develop the Archimedes
 area in later years.
    The only LRV on public display is Rover 1, which is on permanent
 exhibition at the Pioneer Museum in picturesque, suburban Hadley Base,
 along with other priceless artifacts of one of the earliest lunar 
 expeditions. 
    For more information on visiting the historic Pioneer Museum, the 
 metropolitan Archimedes area, or for general information on visiting 
 Luna, please xmail the Tourism Office of the Province of Luna, Terra/Sol, 
 your local Traveller\'s Aid Society facility, or the IISS Interstellar 
 Tourism Bureau."

NOTES:

  Tricky to design in FF&S, but this is about as close as it gets.  
  The actual LRV only massed about 200 kg, and folded for delivery in
  the LM; this is too heavy.  Also:

* Errata for STEP 8: TRANSMISSION.  Prices should be in Cr, not MCr.
* Suggestion for CHAPTER 4: CONTROLS.  Consider adding a "Restricted"
  workstation of 1.5 kL for motorcycles.  I just noticed this as I was
  stripping weight, it has nothing to do with this design.
* I looked at the official designs, and "Open" means that the vehicle is
  designed like a convertible or civilian car, with sides and a front and
  back.  The LRV is just a platform with wheels.  So I used the adding 
  armor rules in reverse, and removed all the front, rear, top, and side 
  armor.  Use the open vehicle rules in combat, but shots that hit the 
  armor automatically penetrate (but the damage table changes normally).  
  This is the only house rule I used for this design.  The hull was also 
  lightened by using a quarter centimeter of TL7 light composite as the 
  material, the lightest FF&S material available at TL7.  The control 
  system is only tech-5, as is the cramped crewstation, but then a big
  computer isn\'t necessary.   Wheels are cross-country.  The 16mm movie
  camera was treated the same as the video camera, which came from the
  control section\'s RPV rules.  The radio relays the video camera, and
  maybe the suit radios.

That\'s because were all too busy throwing rocks at each other and 
deciding whether to buy bronze daggers or FGMP\'s for our mercenary 
units.  :-)  Since no one else has posted a response to your query, I 
will try.

Look at the other end of the scale too.  If you have five PC\'s with four 
terms each in the Navy, and each character spends two terms enlisted and 
two as an officer, the group gets 70 ship DM\'s.  They can get almost any 
type of ship they want with no DM\'s to work off.

I reread the section in question several times, and can find nothing which 
better explains ship acquisition.  (I have the first printing.)  I would 
either go with your solution #1 or use one of these:

3) Set a limit to the maximum negative modifier (e.g. -4).  This will 
   have a similar effect to #1.

4) Forget the random table and give the players a ship if you want them 
   to have one.  You are the GM and must decide what best fits into your 
   plans.

Personally, I prefer #4, although I might look at the number of ship DM\'s 
the players have in making this decision.  If you prefer random 
determination, #1 sounds the best to me, although I would make the 
players distribute the DM\'s to wear and payments before rolling on the 
type table.

I hope this helps (at least a little).

I was thinking of the good, bad guy discussion when reading Path of Tears
and the TNE rules, and came up with a couple of other points. Please
note that this is a very cynical veiw of the RC and is meant for discussion
not flames ....

Page 82 TNE rules, shows what happens when the RC comes up against the 
Regency, the Sector Govorners quote, but then goes on to justify the RC
down the page.

The RC thinks they\'re the good guys, hoping they have good morals, but
using bad guy tactics, and blaming those tactics on limited time and
resources, justifying it\'s self by saying "For the Good of Humanity" ....
What else has been justified by similar quotes ? (I can think of a couple
that would get flamed if I put them in).

"Dose the end justify the means ?"

If the RC dosn\'t like the way someone is running their world, and resists
becoming an RC member and changing their ways, they abitarily
exterminate them, stop.

Not only that, but they are armed robbers. They nick other peoples property
using lethal force, for no other reason than that the people who have it
aren\'t using it properly, ie not for the good of the RC, and that the RC
needs it for it\'s purposes .... to remove other rulers, using higher
technology, to expand it\'s power base .... sound like a TED to you ?

On Junak (Oriflamme), Oriflamme marines do SAG raids on the place for no
other reason, than to find better ways of doing SAG raids. I imagine killing
many innocents on the way ... Armed robers perfecting, armed robery ...
Although this can be blamed on Oriflamme, the bad guys of the RC, to the
rest of the universe it makes no difference, and the outside of the RC is
what matters when rebuilding interstellar society.

The RC isn\'t very PC with it\'s mission titles, like when it goes in to
take out a TED, it uses decapitation raids, not libaration raids, smash 
and grab, not relic recovery. The Star Vikings jump from the sky,
and start shooting people, not as bad as the guild captain portrays,
but still pretty frightening. Once you get to know them, they\'re realy nice
people ... but before then ?

What will the Regency think ? .... see page 82.

After thought, the Regency reckoned that the RC wasn\'t a bad place, even
though it was a Hiver manipulation ;-) and then asked it\'s self

"Did the end justify the means ?"

the age old philisophical question ....

Please note this is me playing devils advocate, and not taking high moral
ground. If I were running the RC I\'d probably do the same things. I also
like "the what you see is what you get" approach to the RC. When they go on a
decapitaion raid, that\'s what they do, no pussy footing about. If they can\'t
do something one way they\'ll do it another, but they\'ll get it done. They do
what they think is best for the "Good of Humanity", and they do it any way
they can, using any means, where necessary. They have justified to themselves
that "The end justifies the means." and once people are in the RC they find
that it\'s a nice place, where people are striving to do their best, with
what limited time and resources they have.

But then my stomping ground is the Spinward Marches, so in the New Era
I\'d be in the Regency .... ;-)

You\'re right in that anti-matter *power plants* and hand disintegrators
aren\'t available until TL16+, but I was never under the impression that
disintegrators used antimatter.  And building anti-matter power plants and
creating anti-matter are different things.

Anti-matter creation, in fact, goes on all the time right now -- Physicists
routinely use antimatter electrons (positrons) and protons (negatrons? --
can\'t remember) in the various flavors of atom smashers we have lying around.

So, really, my original question stands:  Why aren\'t the intrepid weapons
designers of the 57th century building antimatter PAWS?

 Suere, a hollowpoint goes great on a milk jug, but if you look at the 
human bodys relisiency -vs- copper coated lead. wich is more likley to 
give way without affecting the other?
 The problem with hollowpoints is that they have to hit a bone to be very 
effective, and if they do hit a bone. They\'re already being slowed down 
tremendousley.

_All_ bullets tumble. even .50cal BMG SLAP rounds. even through light 
brush, as demonstrated in the FF&S article on p.100.

 True, but if you have a small pistol round with not a whole lot of 
powdwer in it. Your gonna have some very low velocity and innacurate rounds.
 At least cut the range in half, and destroy any sembelance of armour 
piercing.
>article bears this out - look how much more lethal shotguns (multiple

 Yes, shotguns are very leathle at short range, but the pellets arn\'t 
good for getting through armour, and the slugs lack those pellets.

 You also have to keep in mind, that the intent of modern ammunition is 
more to wound(in a military situation) then to kill.
 If you wound someone in a modern army, not only are you taking them out 
of actoin, but your also tieing up nurses, streacher bearers, vehicles 
rescources, and a signifigant amount of time on the part of the army that 
he belongs to.
 Whereas if he\'s just dead, they can just leave him there or throw him 
onto a slow supply truck.

I think (and hope) you\'re right, Rob.  I\'d hate to think it was all so 
simplistically black and white.  One of the best things about the Traveller 
universe is that it\'s rather complex backdrop has been unpredictable.  There

of
twists and turns the Fifth Frontier War and later the Rebellion would take.
I 
certainly didn\'t anticipate virus!

According to a recent Challenge survey, most Traveller fans would want the 
Regency to prevail over the Coalition if it comes to a head.  I\'d tend to
agree 
that central authority works better in this campaign environment.  Governing 
such huge expanses of space doesn\'t lend itself well to democracy when the 
fastest mode of communication is the X-Boat pony express.

A great science fiction book that deals with the subject of authority across 
interstellar space is David Feintuch\'s "Midshipman\'s Hope."  I recommend it
to 
anyone looking for inspiring sci-fi reading, especially those who are
conducting
Traveller naval campaigns.

However I am a gamer, or rather a player.  So I have some experience in
shooting GM\'s novelties items out of the water.

On a planetary surface the use of gravity altering fields to act as a
high technology moat looks possible to me.  Having a ring of higher
G around an instillation ( 10G ? 15G ? 100G ? ) would have negligible
effect on the planet.  The effect of suddenly changing the gravity in
a section of a starship is a bit troublesome.

The ship would act as if it had just been hit, deep in its guts, with a
multi-ton 1G mass.  All the ships structure "over" the new gravity field
would be pulled towards the "bottom" of the field.

If the ship were not specificly designed with extra strong structure ( $$$ )
it would be like pummeling the inside of your craft with mass weapons.
The higher the G field the greater the damage.

This does bring into the fray a new range of weapons ( at least ones I never
thought of before ).  Mines and missiles with gravity field generators.

Whatever the method of inducing artificial gravity.  Make a big one that
will cause havoc with navigation, or be used to rip the armor plating off
of war ships.

What happens when a starship passes through a field of "asteroids" and
they start becoming planetary mass gravity wells ( for a brief instant,
of course. )

What happens when that rock suddenly shoots towards you at nth G ( what do
missiles travel at in TNE? ) and then try their damnedest to become a
singularity when in proximity to your ship.  How long can a dispersed
structure last in even a .1 G field?

Maybe the trigger is when a jump is occuring within a certain radius.

Flaws with these weapon ideas?

Does my idea about damaging your own ship while altering its artificial
G field hold water?

It has been a long time since I played Traveller, and nearly as long
since I toyed with ship design.  So any critique is welcome.

p.s. I get both traveller and xboat in digest form and have a LOT of
catching up to do.  So if this has been covered just send me a note

objections to the Coalition were raised by a "historian" in _Survival 
Margin_.

Even so, the historian pointed out that the RCES thought they were doing 
what they could, from their POV in history. Later anti-RCES comments were 
dismissed by the historian as "embarrassed hand-wringings" on the part of 
the commentators.

ie. I would disagree that GDW has portrayed the RCES as high and moral; 
only that they were prepared to get things done.

My reading of the TL section was that bulk anti-matter, and anti-matter 
containment/reactors, is indeed TL16+ -- however, you have to remember that
C20 
Earth is producing (minute) quantities of anti-matter in particle
accellerators!
We can, and do, today produce particle beams of anti-protons; adding 
neutralising positrons would not be difficult (to make a neutral beam).
There 
is a high cost in energy to produce the beam, as the production system relies
on 
blasting a particle beam at a suitable target and collecting the few neutrons

that collect an electron and get knocked out as anti-protons (to be collected

into the new beam...)

Impact from an anti-hydrogen beam would add a lot of energy to the collision,

but the beam density would be lower for a given powered generator.  OTOH, the

annihilation would generate swarms of secondary particles and gamma rays.... 
yuck!

Below I have copied the letter I wrote to GDW last week, and I\'m now waiting

....................................................................

Dear Dave,

I while back I got this idea of making a electronic version of Kfan Uzangou. 
A newsletter for Vargr in Traveller. If you look through your papers you 
should find copies of this fanzine.

What I basically want is a permission to distribute it electronically.

The hyperzine (as I call it) will:

- Not copy material by GDW or its licencees.

- Neither will it contain previously distributed traveller material from GDW 
or its licencees.

- It will be available on the Internet WWW system, thus being available for 
those who wants to read it online.

- When editor is in doubt if the material has been distributed before or 
been copied from other sources the material will not be released before its 
status has been cleared.

- The editor (me) will follow any rules or guidelines from GDW.

- The hyperzine will be free, and it is a non-profit venture.

- The material are expected to be largely HIWG documents and other types of 
HIWG work.

- Release of issues will be infrequent.

- One issue will only be released once from me. After that interestees(?) 
have to find the hyperzine on the net some how.


This is the basic idea. I would like to have your input, as I feel I\'m in 
the grey, if not in the dark about this issue when it comes to copyrights 
and all that.

As far as I can work out the smallest vehicle you can produce with FF&S is 
pretty big - mostly due to the requirement for a 2.5m3 crewstation as a

Has anyone got any house rules on designing small vehicles - such as a

If a planet didn\'t collapse because it didn\'t get infected with the Virus 
is it likely that it has advanced a tech level in the past 70 years?


There is a system with tech level G at 2110 Delphi that may have survived 
unscathed!  This is because it is in the middle of the rift.  It takes J4 
or J5 ships to reach it and I *think* most ships in the Imperium don\'t 
jump that far.  There are only a couple of cruisers in the official 
materials that can J5 and I think that the odds of them being "in the 
neighborhood" during the initial infection phase of VIRUS are slimmer 
than say the survival of the Union of Suffern.

your comments are appreciated.

I believe so: Most stations will have antigrav or rotate for an 
pseudo-gravity effect.  This is for those societies that have chosen to 
live in a zero-gee lifestyle.

In warfare, one of the major problems is actually financing all that 
equipment.  In my own universe, I\'m planning to arrange a military 
buildup of naval fleet\'s, and I\'d like to know how to model the problems 
of debt and inflation in the traveller setting. (Use either the TCS rules 
as a basis, or the Economic rules for TNE\'s World Tamer Handbook (ugh!  
Is there anyway to make them less complex?))  How much debt can I get 
into before inflation becomes serious... 1 times Gross World Product? 5 
times?  How should I model interest rates?  And inflation?  And how much 
debt is two much? (a la the Soviet Union?)

Detailed data is fine, but what I\'m really looking for is handy rules of 
thumb.

===========================

Secondary concern (To Battle Rider fans (TNE) and TCS pro\'s (Classic):

In several of my polities (and in the Classic Imperial Universe) I have a 
hodge-podge of ship\'s, of varying tech levels.  If I have, say, 2 TL F 
BCr ships and 4 TL E BCr ship\'s, what is the best way to use them?  Let 
the TL F ships lead (do the active scanning, make first contact, etc) and 
hide my TL E ship\'s as a \'stratigic reserve\'?  Or let the TL E ship\'s act 
as "Bait", with the TL F ship\'s acting as the "bolt from the blue"?

Again, the emphasis should be on "rules of thumb", rather than detailed 
exposition.  (though I appreciate that, too)  For the sake of discussion, 
assune that the threat force is composed similarily.

Oh yeah: for Classic fans, this is also a good time to discuss how 
somewhat obsolete equipment (TL E ship\'s, in the Classic Universe) is 
best used in a TL E/F task force. 

========================

Is there an archive anywhere for interesting Traveller incidents? There 
should be!

As far as I\'m aware, it\'s the cost to buy .... but I don\'t remeber reading
any thing about it, my characters have always brought at design prices.

Try the rule expantions at the back of the RC Equipment guide, I remember
them including a small workstation on the "Broom Stick" and maybe the 
grav belt.

Mr. Miller ... ;-)

Grandfather was a super intelegeny Droyne, who did lots of experiments on
anything that interested him, created some kids, had an interstella war,
and then vanished into his own private Universe, in the Regina Subsector
Spinward Marches. Pick up a copy of  Classic Traveller Adventure 12 for
more information.

The Primordials are high tech interstella wonders, who have a large
collective mind, which tries to find things to look at that interests
them. Pick up MegaTraveller Knightfall, and the MegaTraveller Journal 4 (?).

I\'d tend to agree with the historians as well, but there are a cupple of
things that are very dodgy, like the Oriflamme marines do SAG raids on
Junak, for practice, this shouldn\'t be happening. It gose against RC
operating procedure, as the world will take more resources and longer to
assimulate in the future.

GDW portrays the RCES as "what you see is what you get" guys and gals,
doing what they do for "the Good of Humanity", which kind of implies they
have high morals.

The RC is also trying to regulate the "Lancer" teams that go out into the
wilds on raids (how would you regulate them ?like starmecs ?) so that world
assimulation is easier, because most of them see Zippers as Zippers, and not
potential members of the RC, implying that not all Lancers have good enough
morals. The Trigger (?) incident reported on CIN is one such case I believe.

No, it implies that the RC _thinks_ they hold the moral high ground.  But
then, so did the Spanish in South & Central America, the British in India,
the Americans in Central America...

Given the love of history held by Frank, Loren et al I suspect that the RC is
in for a period of serious self-questioning sometime in its future.  There
might even be reparations to the survivors of SAG raids on Junak!  (Or
possibly not: have the survivors of Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki etc been
compensated?)

The last time someone asked why antimatter PAWS are not used the answer 
appeared to be that the energy contained in the particle beam due to the 
fact that the particles are moving at relativistic velocities is much 
greater than the energy contained in the mass of the particles.
Thus the additional energy delivered to the target in an APAWS beam would be 
marginal.
Also the energy required to create the antimatter would probably be greater 
than that delivered to the target and would be better used to create a 
faster beam anyway!

In digest 294, Scott Brogley wrote about the use of grav generators as
weapons.

My reading of the system is as follows:
1. The effectiveness of artificial grav generators drops off dramatically
with 
range. In effect, any "g-missiles" would have to be practically touching the 
target ship to have any effect - and this has been ruled out in TNE due to 
anti-missile fire: "...somewhere in the last 30000(?) km a missile will be 
killed".
2. Effects inside a ship are limited due to the surrounding dampers; that is,

those in adjoining rooms, and those on the floors above and below. The damper

field is supposed to cushion occupants against forces which - potentially -
can 
come along ANY ship axis. Therefore, the field must cover a discrete area -
and 
ALL of that discrete area - in order for it to protect its occupants.
3. Any other effects, I believe, should be able to be neutralised by the
ship\'s 
own CG plates. The things which lift a ship should - in my view - be stronger

than and able to overwhelm anything a localised generator can produce.

Anti-matter protons are called \'anti-protons\'.

The particle accelerator I work with at CERN accelerates protons for an 
energy of 450GeV (giga electron-volts; 1 electron-volt = 1.6E-19 joules). 
This is about 450 times the mass of the proton and so the particle\'s mass 
is essentially irrelevant. Anti-protons would in fact be WORSE than 
normal protons in a weapon since they have a larger cross-section for 
interactions with matter and so will tend to penetrate less (although the 
effect is very small). The main reason for not using anti-protons though 
is that they are far harder to produce, this is the reason why the new 
LHC collides two proton beams at a 14TeV (14x10E12 electron volts), an 
anti-proton beam is just too difficult to make.

The \'high-tech\' trick for anti-matter is unlikely to be containment but 
more likely to be how can you produce anti-matter for less energy than 
you get from it? In almost all cases when you produce anti-particles 
you produce and equal and opposite number of \'normal\'-particles, mixing 
these together again merely means that you get back the energy you 
originally put in, useful for batteries but not much else.

To get useful energy out you need to find someway of producing 
anti-particles WITHOUT the associated particle ie. an interaction which 
is different for matter and anti-matter. We know that there has to be 
something that does this since the Universe is made of matter, with no 
traces of anti-matter anywhere. We can observe something of a difference 
in the decays of neutral kaons (a type of meson) and the experiment I\'m 
working on is trying to find what causes this difference. (The technical 
term for this is break in the matter/anti-matter symmetry is CP violation).

Anti-protons are produced essentially by the protons kinetic energy being 
turned into mass in the form of quarks which may then combine to form 
anti-protons - this uses the STRONG force. Electron capture/emission by a 
neutron is caused by the WEAK force and so has a far, far smaller chance 
of occuring. (a neutrino can only interact using the weak force and these 
can sail through the earth without noticing!)

As I mentioned above the particle\'s own mass is effectively negligible, 
and in any case at such energies the proton will fragment in almost 
exactly the same way as the anti-proton will, creating showers of photons 
and pions.

I hope the above helps clear up some points!

The whole procedure is an attempt to substitute dice rolls for Referee
discretion. I don\'t expect I\'ll ever run an RC campaign, but if I did
I most certainly wouldn\'t let the question of what kind of starship, if
any, the PCs had depend on die rolls. A starship has a tremendous
influence on a campaign  -  it\'s presence or absence and it\'s size and
armament dictates a LOT about the flavour and style of a campaign. If
my players have a starship then I want to design the campaign to fit.
And since I\'d lay down the basic campaign parameters before the players
designed their characters  -  in fact, before I even decided who to
invite to join the campaign  -  the whole question about ship or no 
ship would have been decided by me in advance.

I came to a similar conclusion with robot designs. However, 
fuel cells are much more prone to go bang if mishandled - 
and battery-battledress can be charged at any wall socket. 
At high enough TLs, though, neither of these are a problem.

Battle dress designs 

Someone asked me about battle dress designs using fuel cells.  Here are the
statistics  for  such designs.  The following table gives design statistics
identical  to  those in the basic Fire, Fusion & Steel book, extended up to
TL  17.   They are fully powered up to their maximum mass, which also gives
their  listed  fuel consumption (However, see fuel consumption note below).
Note in all cases except TL 10, excess power is generated which may be used
for  other  purposes,  but  decreases  the  listed  endurance.   At TL 14+,
doubling  the  size  of the fuel cell provides enough input energy to power
one  shot  every  10  phases  of  the  meson gun listed on the David design
submitted  to this list earlier.  The difference between the total mass and
maximum  mass (listed as ExcessM) may be loaded with any equipment desired,
without  overloading  the  frame or fuel cell.  In fact, in TL 12+ designs,
the  fuel  cell  provides enough power to overload the frame up to 30%, but
this also reduces fuel endurance.

masking  is  rated  for 1 cubic metre, which exceeds the maximum volume the
armour is ever likely to occupy.

Because  the  laser  communicator uses so much power, it is usual to have a
weapon  which  uses  input  power equal to the 0.005 MW plus any excess MW,
which  prevents  the laser communicator being used simultaneously.  This is
typically  a squad level gauss weapon.  Additionally, many designs will not
use  decoys,  because  of  their expense and mass requirements.  The listed

Fuel Consumption Note

Fire,  Fusion  &  Steel does not give any rules concerning determining fuel
consumption  beyond the cryptic "Given in kl/hour per MW of output".  There
are at least two possible ways of handling this.

   *  Fuel consumption is determined from maximum output only.  This is the
least realistic and most inefficient.  However, for nuclear powerplants, it
is probably sufficient.

   * Fuel consumption is determined from required output.  This is the most
efficient, and nearly realistic.  Determine two states of fuel consumption,
per  4  hour  period.   Firstly,  determine  the  kl/hour  consumed  by all
continuously  running  systems  except  that  required for the transmission
(Movement)  and  multiply  by 4.  This is the operational fuel consumption.
Then  determine  the  kl/hour  consumed  by the transmission (Movement) and
multiply  by  2.   This  is the travel move fuel consumption.  Don\'t forget
that up to two travel moves may be made per 4 hour period, also that travel
move  is  computed at half maximum speed.  Additional one shot systems such
as anything requiring a homopolar generator may either be rated for maximum
shots,  and  have  fuel  set  aside  for  their  use, or have a listed fuel
consumption per shot.  This is (input MJ /3600) * Kl/hour.

   * Twilight:  2000 implies that many powerplants, in particular, the fuel
turbines  used  by  the M1A1 tanks, consume large amounts of fuel even when
idylling.   Determine the minimum output from the minimum powerplant volume
as  listed, and determine minimum fuel consumption in kl/hour.  Multiply by
4  to determine minimum consumption per 4 hour period.  The following table
gives the minimum consumptions for chemical power plants.

		         Minimum
TL  Description   MW    Kl/Hour Kl/Period
3   Early steam   0.025 0.005     0.020

7   Gas turbine   0.25  0.075     0.300
8   MHD turbine   0.60  0.12      0.480

The  above  battle  dress  designs  have  a fuel consumption based on their
required  power  usage, not their powerplant maximum output.  With point 3,
use  the  following  minimum  fuel cell consumptions, which also gives fuel
consumption for maximum output if the design is rated this way.

 More than anything else, your bankruptcy level must be based on 
 both your _actual_ ability to eventually pay off debts, and your 
 _perceived_ ability to eventually pay off debts.  Consider:  The 
 United States is close to a trillion (US usage) dollars (US) in 
 debt.  Nearly one-fifth of tax receipts go to pay the interest on 
 that debt.  Additionally, the Government runs a chronic deficit of 
 hundreds of millions of dollars annually.  The currency is 
 strictly fiat, and even _those_ dollars are "Federal Reserve 
 Notes", borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank System, which is an 
 organization of 12 regional "superbanks", each controlled by
 members who are also banks, and which are totally outside the 
 control of the Treasury Department of the United States.  If 
 considered rationally, an individual that ran his budget the way 
 the United States does would be considered bankrupt and a bad 
 risk, and probably couldn\'t borrow at any price - even the loan 
 sharks wouldn\'t touch him.

 On the other hand, there is a lot of confidence that the US will 
 continue to exist (I don\'t share it, for a variety of political 
 reasons irrelevant to the question at hand, or even to the list 
 except as an intellectual exercise concerning planetary 
 government), and thus that any bonds issued will be paid off 
 (probably by issuing new ones...).  The dollar is considered a 
 strong currency, a safe haven from national economies that are 
 prone to super- or hyper-inflation (former Soviet republics, most
 of the smaller countries in Latin America, most of Africa, etc.), 
 and it is a "standard" currency, against which other currencies 
 are measured.  Because of this, the US is _not_ bankrupt.

 In the interstellar setting, much of the same thought process must 
 be undertaken.  Is the planetary government stable, and is it 
 likely to repudiate its debts?  What shape is its economy in?  
 What\'s the basis of its currency, and what is the inflation rate?  
 How reliable are its collections, both in quantity and timeliness? 
 Etc.?  Etc.?  Etc.?

 Basically, there are no real rules of thumb.  There can\'t be; 
 you\'re dealing with human (and possibly non-human) perceptions, 
 and they\'re going to decide when to revoke your American 
 Express(tm) Card.

 Remember also that the investors\' outlooks determine how you\'re 
 rated.  A rock-solid investment to a Sylean or Solomani might look
 a tad risky to a Vilani...

There is some debate in Scout circles on whether Iper\'mar nomads should be 
treated as a world, as a cultural group or as an Imperial client state: I 
propose to treat them as a cultural group, but with their own appendix in 
the RICE papers.  Even though they are not a world per se [although they 
DO have terrtory: see following] the Regency Institute for Cultural 
Education has decided that this culture is important and unique enough to 
merit a paper on them, especially considering the value of their work as 
unsung but important members of the Regency community.

In Person:

The Iper\'mar (\'Refugees\' in Old Kurae) can be found throughout the Regency, 
but are noticable in Querion, Vilis, Lanth, Lunion, Five Sisters, 
Plankwell, Glisten and Trin\'s Veil subectors, as well as throughout the 
Regency portions of the Trojan Reaches.  Most casual tourist will meet 
them around starports, public functions or supervising and designing the 
operation of high-tech equipment on low-tech worlds.  

Often, the Iper\'marion (singular of Iper\'mar) will be wearing the uniform 
of his contractor -- often a large, Regency-wide corporation, or local 
clothing.  On their own ship\'s and installations, they prefer simple 
short-and-shirt overalls, often in some dull shade of khaki or grey, but 
with bright accessories (flashy jacket\'s, oversized jewellery, and high 
boot\'s for women; aviation helmets [with engraved family glyphs], 
humongous capes and complex, everchanging TL D-E bodypaint illustrations for 
men).  They don\'t use deorderants, but do use sonic showers.

They\'re Anglic is quite clear, but somewhat high-pitched.  About 
one out of five can still speak Old Kurae, the mother tongue.  Many of 
the upper and upper-middle classes can speak 3 or more human languages: 
they\'re somewhat racist, and avoid dealing with Vargr, Aslan, or other 
non-humans when possible.  However, they are absolutely fascinated with 
the Zhodani, not so much for their psionics, but with their culture.

The Iper\'mar are proud of their technical expertise, (they consider TL E 
items as beneath them, and absolutely adore little TL G trinket\'s), and 
tend to be condensending to those from worlds below TL F.  Many have a 
\'colonial master\' attitude to low-tech commoner\'s thay they are in 
charge of, but can respect low-tech rulers and merchants... if they are 
*good*.  They will never demean a low-tech client to their face, but 
if tested, have subtle ways of letting their feelings known.

Within the Regency, Iper\'mar business pratices are ethically impeccible: 
they realise that the Regent won\'t stand by and let High-tech nomads rip 
off Low-tech locals.  Moreover, they like to have long-term 
relationship\'s with their clients, relationships that flurish best 
in an atmosphere of trust.  Finally, they value their business 
reputation: they have been nomadic for over 450 years, and interstellar 
traders for another 200 years, and know what doors a good rep can open.
  
Outside of the Regency, their pratices are somewhat more... flexible. 

Government within the Iper\'mar is by neo-tribal democratic method\'s, 
similar to that of Tausus (Spinward Marches/1138: B584620-A), but with 
greater reliance on AI (non-viral).  The Archon -- or the top ruler of 
the tribe -- is little more powerful then his fellow tribal lords, but 
has the Noble rank of Marquis.  Intergration with the new democratic 
element\'s of the Regency is going quite smoothly. 

Because of their support (above and beyond the call of duty) of the Imperial 
government within the Empty Quarter they were granted certain legal 
priveleges, rendering their ship\'s effectively immune to searches by 
system governments, by Emperor Garvin.  The Iper\'mar remain rather 
civic-minded for interstellar nomads, and will support the Regency when they 
can.  They generally want the rest of the Imperium to be re-intergrated, but 
CAREFULLY and SLOWLY and with CAUTION ... the Iper\'mar use the best 
anti-viral technology on the market, but still deeply dread any kind of 
outbreak. (Iper\'mar ship started to revisit Trin only 7 years ago!)

The religious attitudes of the Iper\'mar is rather bland, generally 
worshipping as the locals do.  They have no real strong religious 
feelings, and -- on their ship\'s and bases -- prefer to philosophise 
about the gods rather than pray to them.  The dead tend to be simply 
buried on some world or other (according to local custom), and is eventually 
forgotten.

Most Iper\'marion\'s are of "Imperial" descent -- that is, of 
Solomani/Vilani mixture, but also have strains of four different minor 
races (including the Darrians... oops, Daryens).  On the tall side, but 
can easily function in one gee: their ship\'s are set to 1G largely 
because they have to go dirtside so often in their line of work.  There 
were at least four different "races" of Iper\'mar pre-Rebellion, but the 
only known surviving one -- the Deneb branch of the culture -- is of light 
complexion, with brown to sandy blond hair, large facial features, and 
dark eyes.

There are 8.34 million Iper\'marion\'s within current Regency border\'s 
(down from about 30 million, Imperium-wide, before the Rebellion/Collapse).
Roughly 5 million is in two deep space bases, Laro Dif (\'The Twilight Star\'
in Old Kurae) and He\'seme (\'Gentle Starlight\').  While their location is 
known to the Regency Navy, the Iper\'mar is secretive regarding their 
location to outsiders.  Only 500,000 are on the roughly 1400 starship\'s 
that the Iper\'mar own at any given time: most of the rest are on \'ground 
assignment\' helping to design, maintain, and sometimes build high-tech 
items for their low-tech clientele (or low-tech items using high-tech 
knowledge or methods).  Outside of the Regency, roughly 72,000 are known to 
reside within the Zhodani Consulate: roughly 1.2 million operate spinward 
of the Spinward marches, mainly in The Beyond and Far Frontier\'s sectors.

Insistent rumours about \'the lost clans\' somewhere in the Wilds are 
generally discounted by the Iper\'mar themselves: because of their 
procivility towards high-tech equipment, they were probably more 
vulnerable to the AI Virus then the free traders.

History:

The Iper\'mar are interstellar nomads, originating from the Great Dimurik 
Miim War of 740.  Essentially, the Iper\'mar are the decendants of a 
number of powerful trading families from Kurae, a once-notable world that 
suffered through a impoverishing and destructive series of wars from 723 
to 792.  As their wealth was being seized by the government\'s involved in 
the Dimurik Miim War, the merchant\'s choose to flee the system, surviving 
first as a merchant line, but by 800 their livelihood was earned as a mobile 
professional knowledge elite, trading on their technical expertise.  

>From Zarushagar sector, they spread throughout the Imperium coreward of 
Zarushagar, and were especially prominent in comparatively low-tech regions 
of the Imperium like the Spinward Marches and the Empty Quarter. 
Specializing in providing workable high-tech solutions to low-tech systems, 
the Iper\'mar was (and in the Regency, remains) one of the binding forces 
of the interstellar community.

The Kurae system is located in Zarushagar sector, hex 0503: UWP 
fell from A66794B-D in 700 to X667872-A by 800; the UWP was D667989-6 
just before the Rebellion.  By 930 the Republic of Haasii, the government 
of Kurae, was attempting to lure the Iper\'mar back to Kurae: about 418,000, 
or 7% of the total Iper\'mar population, was residing on Kurae by 1100.

As an interstellar business and as a culture, they suffered bitterly 
during the Rebellion.  Their stock-in-trade need\'s safe starlanes in 
order to work: without it, they were forced to stay dirtside, 
trying to survive in an unfamiliar, deteriorating enviroment. 

Even in the Spinward Marches, where the Iper\'mar both had semi-safe trade 
routes [Thanks to the Domain Navy] and a solid economic enviroment [the 
Archduke often used their services in order to save damaged and doomed 
worlds within the Domain], they still had to suffer heavy draft\'s -- both 
military and otherwise -- and a skyrocketing tax rate.  Afterward\'s, in 
the wake of Virus, the Iper\'mar had to cope with virusproofing their 
installations and ship\'s, a very expensive endeavor. (They are still 
paying off the cost of it.)    

Economics:

First arriving in the Marches in c. 820, the Iper\'mar rapidly gained 
prominence within the hostile-enviro branch of the construction industry 
as low-cost producers, eventually becoming so successful as to become a 
favoured subcontractor for several megacorps working in the region.  They 
espanded to the starport construction industry in the 940s, and 
invested in both planetary weather management (designing and overseeing 
controlled weather systems for poor and low-tech governments) and 
experimented briefly in mass robot construction gangs from the 1090s to  
the Rebellion period.

In the post-Collapse period, the Iper\'mar specialized in helping low-tech 
governments (up to TL D, in some cases) virus-proof starport\'s, 
communication equipment, etc. -- largely under the Regency aegis.  They 
also made some real money, rebuilding the rimward Regency border regions 
from Aslan attack. 

Currently, the Iper\'mar are in a great debate on whether they should expand 
into the Wilds.  As TL F people, they are extremely vulnerable to Virus 
infections, but the scale of the money to be made is simply mind-boggling.
The Iper\'mar are constantly on the lookout for ways to reduce their 
vulnerability to the AI Virus: they will pay any price for a reliable,  
broad-spectrum "vaccine" for Virus.

The classic, instantly-recognizable ship of the Iper\'mar is the Or 
Viasic liner, built to a closely-guarded design on Rhylanor.  Built to 
house 84 field specialists and their families, it\'s a common sight\'s on 
low-tech starports and the poorer worlds.

With an extensive communication suite, it can be used as a orbiting or 
space-borne operations and control platform for a variety of projects.
The ship below is meant for Regency operations: for out-of-Regency 
projects, starmerc\'s are usually hired for protection.  Note the lack of 
cargo space: Iper\'mar clients usually either arrange cargo 
transportation seperately or the Iper\'marion clanlord will outsource 
this to non-Iper\'mar traders.  Note the main deficency in this design: no 
small craft capasity.  This is considered "a waste of space" by the 
Iper\'mar: the same people who installed 123 apartments on their ship, 
of 400 kl each!   

Non-Imperial Iper\'mar use the same design, but routinely make extensive 
modifications, adding internal armour, lasers, sandcasters, MFD\'s, and 
extensive cargo space. (No, they don\'t have docking bays: they prefer to use 
the cargo bay to store vechiles.) This cut\'s down on living space 
drastically:  Non-Imperial Iper\'marion are considered the \'poor 
cousin\'s\' of the Iper\'mar due to the routine  indignities they have to 
put up with, from having to sleep four to a small stateroom (vs. the 
small *apartments* on the ship below) to having to actually use the 
\'repair facilities\' (snort, snort) of a TL C, Starport D world, to 
having to actually use Inferior Equipment (anything below TL F) to 
repair their ship.

The thing that Non-Imperial Iper\'mar have to worry about most is adding 
or repairing their ship with Strange Tech. ("Strange Tech" includes any 
electronic item, hard or software, that isn\'t of Regency [or, in a 
pinch, Zhodani] manufacture, still untouched and shrink wraped).
The legends and tales surrounding Strange Tech is a sure party-pleaser in 
most starport bars. 

Powerful and wealthy Clanlords tend to drastically cut the amount of 
personnel on their ship\'s, using the space for park\'s, gym\'s, pool\'s, 
etc.  The Archon\'s ship is pratically a jump-capable party, as he 
"liasions" with subsector-to-Regency notables, and the occasional 
visiting Zhodani: Aslans and Vargr are never invited.

Important Note: NonImperial Iper\'mar have no problem with using robots on 
   their ship\'s: however, these robots are never permitted to 
   communicate to the outside world, never leave the ship, and
   are forbidden to handle Strange Tech until the owner has O.K.\'ed it.

Ever thought that the liners that GDW provides are just a *little* too 
small?

Where, here\'s a rather larger liner, just right for those populous star 
system\'s.  This particular liner was considered a "high-tech" liner in 
the Empty Quarter: first built at 902 on Saree Tio (1129/Empty Quarter, 
A210522-C in 1100), it became a fairly popular model, making the small 
Akigaa-Zhihang Starship Company a steady source of revenue.  About 14 of 
these ship\'s were registered in the Domain at 1116: only one, The Hope of 
Dawi Screen, is still operational at 1200, plying the Jewell - Kakege - 
Louzy - Efate route.

The ship is somewhat longer than "standard form" requires, at 84 m.
Recently overhauled (treat ship as with Wear Value 3), the Dawi Screen is 
currently the only ship of the Dawi Screen Line (owned, of course, by 
Sir Dawi Screen, a highly successful stock speculator on Jewell).

The Hope of Dawi Screen is unique in Jewell subsector by being the first 
non-high passenger craft to \'waste space\' by providing gardens, gym\'s, 
cafe\'s, stores\' a observation lounge with a stunning "glass-bottom" 
view, and a garden to passenger\'s.  While other Liner captions are 
willing to admit that \'customer care\' is very nice on the Hope of Dawi 
Screen, they think that the ship is still a white elephant: the space, in 
their view, should have gone to extra cargo.

This ship is designed as an attempt to test out the concept of 
\'Value-added shipping\': that is, prices for the Middle Passengers are 
increased 25% in return for increased facilities and a more plesant trip.
Moreover, the usual heavy medical supervision needed for so many Low 
Berther\'s has been \'outsourced\' to planetary medical establishments, 
reducing payroll drasically. 

The Jewell government (which has a 10% stake in the ship) has managed to 
convince the Regency government to loosen standard price restrictions and 
medical regulations regarding shipping as a \'one-time\' exception.

As adventures, most Travellers would be working on-board as crew:
this senario would provide a good intro for beginning Travellers, 
providing variety and moderate adventure with the benefit of having a 
\'safe base\' and deep pockets when need be.  As the ship\'s fortunes rise, 
so can the range of adventures and the importance of the ship grow.  

(I mean, how many Imperial liner\'s do you know have an observation deck?  
With additional Stewards, the ship can easily be converted to an High 
Passenger enviroment, but the problem is, those passenger\'s are much less 
likely to be sent in harm\'s way... and you don\'t want to cusion your 
players to much, now do you?)

Experienced Travellers may instead be given the challange of playing Sir 
Dawi Screen (or his direct representatives), attempting to manage the 
ship, interact with the bureaucracy, wheel and deal with the port 
masters, and satisfy the smallest complaint of his passenger\'s: all the 
while trying to get (or increase) the profit\'s.  The opportunity exists 
to make serious money... or make powerful enemies.

(see  previous winging post) i sat down with my copy of RCEG  and
tryed  to  work  out  all the ammo,  (  the  longer  readers  may
remember the plea from last year concerning the shotgun round).

After sitting down with a calculator, the following results  were
found.

>From the 26 listed firearm ammunition types,
7 were incorect and out by factors of 5% and up.
thses include the

7*26mm-5
 This  must  be a straight round yet has been calced  as  a  neck
round , Ea should be 320J

7*30mm-6
 again this should be a straight round with a Ea of 462J

7*30mmE-10
This  is worked through as a necked round, but in FF&S it  states
rounds  must  have a Lcc of 35mm + to be necked.  As  a  straight
round the energy is Ea (alot less).

7.5*50mmE-9
energy should be 9189J ( possibly the wrong TL multiplyer)

7.6*15mmE-9
energy should be 708J

14.5*146mm
energy should be 30860J ( the crunch gun Just got less scary ;) )

And of corse my old fave
18*90mm-10 shotgun
energy should be 5955 J

could  some  one with time see that im right as if i  am  i  will
have  to  sit down and redesign all the affected wepons ,  (  but
dont worry ill post them to the group if i still have the acess).

If a planet didn\'t collapse because it didn\'t get infected with the Virus 
is it likely that it has advanced a tech level in the past 70 years?


There is a system with tech level G at 2110 Delphi that may have survived 
unscathed!  This is because it is in the middle of the rift.  It takes J4 
or J5 ships to reach it and I *think* most ships in the Imperium don\'t 
jump that far.  There are only a couple of cruisers in the official 
materials that can J5 and I think that the odds of them being "in the 
neighborhood" during the initial infection phase of VIRUS are slimmer 
than say the survival of the Union of Suffern.

your comments are appreciated.

SG
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


According the CT supplement covering Imperial Navy ships of the Spin-
ward marches, the IN had it\'s own network of J-6 fleet couriers. The
5th Frontier War game also had some crurons that were J-6. I think it\'s
very likely that there were enough of these around that this system
would get a \'visit\', eventually.

What you want are Glaser \'safety\' rounds - you can forget about getting

This sort of thing should only be possible from Bridge or Engineering

     The Warhorse-Class Merc Frigate was designed and built in limited 
     numbers to cater to the small crowd of ultra-successful mercenary 
     groups operating in the Domain.  Sold only on a contingency basis, the 
     Warhorse-Class is partially subsidized by the Regency with the 
     agreement that the ship must operate on the frontier and in the wilds 
     on the Regency\'s borders for a limited period of time (2-4 years) and 
     then reverting to private operation.
     
     Its main purpose is to operate in extremely hostile environments.  It 
     is armed to dispatch most of its enemies quickly and completely and is 
     frequently employed as a "corsair-buster."
     
     While the Warhorse-Class was originally intended for line expansion, 
     only eight were built after the Regency and private investors 
     determined that the market was too limited for this product.  The 
     eight Warhorse-Class ships built during or before 1201 were titled 
     Warhorse, Pegasus, Kian, Unicorn, Hippocampus, Hippogriff, Griffon and 
     Wyvern.

The \'high-tech\' trick for anti-matter is unlikely to be containment but
more likely to be how can you produce anti-matter for less energy than
you get from it? In almost all cases when you produce anti-particles
you produce and equal and opposite number of \'normal\'-particles, mixing
these together again merely means that you get back the energy you
originally put in, useful for batteries but not much else.
 ----

I always thought that GDW\'s antimatter power plants WERE just "antimatter 
batteries".
The production of that antimatter was not gone into but did not necessarily 
require less energy than the antimatter battery contained.

 ----
To get useful energy out you need to find someway of producing
anti-particles WITHOUT the associated particle ie. an interaction which
is different for matter and anti-matter. We know that there has to be
something that does this since the Universe is made of matter, with no
traces of anti-matter anywhere. We can observe something of a difference
in the decays of neutral kaons (a type of meson) and the experiment I\'m
working on is trying to find what causes this difference. (The technical
term for this is break in the matter/anti-matter symmetry is CP violation).
 ----

I read somewhere that the mass in the universe may be attributable to CP 
violation in the decay of supermassive particles shortly (~10^-35 seconds) 
after the big bang.
As traveller contains gravitic manipulation to the point of the creation of 
pocket universes prehaps similar processes were used by the ancients to 
create supermassive particles to make their antimatter!

I pointed the 7mmACR round problems out to GDW last(?) year.  Loren posted a
message that the FFS errata would include a change to necked rounds being
greater than or equal to 30mm.  I haven\'t seen the FFS erata so I don\'t know
if it was included.  I understand there were other problems with the 7mm ACR
listed in FFS as an example.

I haven\'t played for a year or more so I\'ve sort of lost interest in finding
GDW errors.  How about GDW emailing a complete set of TNE product errata to
this list.  As I don\'t subscribe to Challenge I guess I have missed alot of
the errata.

Never call a man\'s baby ugly....he might take offense.

I designed the original assault shotgun, a  lower tech version of
which appeared in the RCES Equipment Guide.   My TL 12 version
has an average muzzle energy of 5,496.37 J, a barrel length of
54.29 cm, and an actual muzzle energy of 4,946.73 J.

IMHO, the assault shotgun can\'t be beat as a boarding weapon--
deadly even to armored troops at close range (who have to be poured
out of their suits after getting hit a few times), and unlike a plasma or
fusion weapon, it will leave the ship in flyable condition after a shootout.

If anyone is interested, I have developed an even nastier round for
it than the slug HEAP round.  Presenting (drum roll please)....

the HEAP Flechette Round!

The HEAP Flechette round consists of a standard 18mm x 90mm 
shotgun shell and contains 8 HEAP tipped flechette darts.  Production
of this round recently began on Aubaine.  It can be fired from the
standard issue RC assault shotgun.

TL: 12
Diameter:         18 mm
Length:            90 mm
Weight:            68.7 g ea.
Price (ea. rd):  5.5 Cr

Damage:  Medium (ea. dart) -     3
                Close (entire round) - 8 x 3

Penetration:  2-2-2

Rounds per magazine:    20

I would like to suggest around 7pm in one of the restaurants or

send me a brochure of the new facilities.

If enough people show up we could take over the restaurant/bar/lounge!

That reminds me. I was going to check it out for myself, but never got
around to it (mostly because I don\'t believe the Aslan\'s have a snowball\'s
chance in hell of sucessfully invading Glisten, nor that they would be
allowed, should they by some bizarre concatenation of 18 seperate

that writeup?

A wonderful game, IMHO the best hard science fiction game I have
ever found. And it has the best aliens by far.
 
I have a the Near Star Map as a computer file, reachable at
http://www.nada.kth.se/~nv91-asa/dive/NYSTAR3.DAT.Z
(there is also a datafile, stars.vr, for the virtual reality
system DIVE where the user can fly around among the stars).
 
I plan to post my new version of 2300AD soon. I was not
completely happy with the somewhat dated feeling of the game,
so I changed it into a much more dark setting. My version is
essentially the world of Aliens, with some cyberpunk elements
and a much more cynical world. The colonies are poor and
rebellious, the core is growing stranger and stranger, the
Pentapods control an unhealthily large part of the economy,
drugs are extremely common etc.

This is ok for a spaceship\'s power plant, however Alien Module 8 - The 
Darrians mentions that they were building an anti-matter powerplant for a 
city. This cannot have been a battery-type powerplant unless they had 
someway of generating LOTS of cheap electrical energy somewhere else in 
the system and a very efficient method of turning it into usable anti-matter.

Nice idea - although if they have that sort of tech why not create a 
small black hole which will be \'hot\' and then you can turn ordinary 
matter straight into radiation - no more problems of anti-matter 
containment, in fact you could use the fuel as armour!

That\'s sounds very interesting. (It\'s been quite a few years since I\'ve been
involved in high energy physics) This may not be exactly a traveller
question,
but If I recall a while back there was a model of anti particles which
treated
anti-particles as normal particles travelling backwards in time.  This of 
course mandated the symmetry and was used mostly to explain decay of micro
black holes which should have been created in the Big Bang.  Is this still
still a somewhat acceptable theory?

    'month' => '05',
    'index' => 'ap058',
    'body' => '
I decided to follow up the recent thread about TL increases by doing a 
study of the Regina subsector, using new era data from the TNE rulebook,
and comparing this with the megatraveller data in the MT rulebooks.

I found that of the 7 Average stellar worlds in the subsector, 2 rose in
TL by 1 level, EFATE and REGINA, respectively Hi In, and Hi Cp.
The 5 other average stellar worlds Tl remained static. Four of these 
worlds were Ni, 1 Ri.

There were 6 early stellar worlds in the subsector. One rose by 3 TL levels,
Yori, Trade code Ri with a Research base in system.
The other 5 rose by 1 TL level, 1 was Ri, 2 Ni, 1 Fl and 1 Ag.

There were 11 Pre-stellar worlds, 1, Whanga, rose three levels, its Trade
code being Lo Ni. From the rebellion, its pop code went from 1 to 3, and
it\'s spaceport from E to D.
Nine worlds increased one TL, with no outstanding pattern in Trade code.
One world remained static, ROUP, Hi In Wa.

There were 5 industrial worlds, 1 , Heya rose by 2 TL, trade code Ri.
Three rose by 1 TL, a Ni, a Lo Ni, and a Ni Fl.
One stayed static, ALGINE, RED Zone, Hi, starport X.

There were 3 PRE-industrial worlds, 2 rose by 2 Tl\'s, one world with a 
Ri trade class, one with no trade class.
One rose by one, Pscias, Ni Ag, RED Zone, X starport.


I also investigated whether  Tech DM\'s as outlined on page 186 of the 
rulebook had any effect, they did not.
It appears that at Average stellar, it is difficult for a Ni world to
increase Tl in 70 years, possibly the same applys to Ri worlds. Hi pop
In and Cp worlds easily increase TL.
At Early stellar, most worlds can increase in Tl at least one level 
quite easily, posession of a research base assures multiple Tl increases.
At Pre-stellar, most worlds will increase a TL.
At Industrial, most will rise a Tl, with Ri worlds liable to higher
increases.
At pre-Industrial, most will rise 1-2 Tl\'s.

So, in conclusion, it seems that most worlds can increase a Tl, except 
Average Stellar worlds that are not Capitals or Industrial. Worlds with
Research Bases are liable to multiple increases, as are worlds with 
significant population increases, starport improvement(Whanga), or those 
on a main.

How to incorporate this into the system, possibly a D6 roll, -1 DM for a Ni,
-2 DM for Avg Stellar+, +1 DM Early Stellar-, +2 In, +2 Cp. On a roll of
4-6, with modifiers, the Tl increases one level, 7, 2 levels, 8 three levels.
A Research base would provide +3 DM. This is off the top of my head, so no
flames please.

There are 2 E and 2 F Tl worlds in the Spinward marches that possibly 
survive into the New Era, as they are industrial, there\'s a good chance
they are now Tl F and G respectively. 

Thats all for now,

Looks like I missed a reference there. I\'ve got an excuse to get around to 
reading my copy of "Darrians" now :-)
Still, just about every OTHER reference I\'ve seen in Trav has been as the 
"battery type".

As I understood it the descriptions of the supermassive "X" particle and a 
very small black hole are very similar (if not identical).......

Roger Moore <moore@hep.phy.cam.ac.uk> will probably be able to answer this 
as he appears to be a whole bunch more qualified to do so but here\'s my 
Cr0.02 anyway:
I thought that the "anti particles = particles going backwards in time" 
model was just that; a model! It is convienient to help explain some things 
but I have no idea as to its mathematical validity. Also we are talking 
about CP violation, just by the name it appears that some accepted rule(s) 
have been broken!

While the FF&S rule may state: "Necked cartridges [...] must be at least
35mm long in order to be necked.  (There do exist some short pistol rounds
that are slightly necked, but these are included under straight rounds
because their performance is not sufficiently different from straight rounds
to justify a distinction.)"

This rule is both factually incorrect for existing real-world weapons, but
also seems to be honored more in the breach than in the observance.

The following real-world weapons used a necked cartridge shorter than 35mm,
and in some cases, the difference between a necked and a non-necked version
of the cartridge is siginificant enough to warrant a distinction.  The
significant cartridges that I\'m aware of include the 7.62x25mm (.30 Mauser),
8.00x21mm (8mm Nambu), and 7.92x33mm (Sturmgewehr 44).

The following rule was suggested during the playtesting of FF&S as a
replacement for the above rule that was printed.  I still suggest using it.

"Necked cartridges are used whenever the required propellant volume is
larger than a stright cartridge would allow, and the designer doesn\'t want
to lengthen the cartridge.  Necked cartridge cases are usually longer than
35mm, but any cartridge 25mm or longer may be necked."


> 14.5*146mm
> energy should be 30860J ( the crunch gun Just got less scary ;) )

OK, the "Crunch Gun" is my design; I think I\'d better step in with some
comments here.  For the record, there\'s nothing wrong with the design as
presented in RCEG; neither is there anything wrong with your calculator!

The problem with this cartridge design is that the RCEG doesn\'t give you
enough information to complete the design!  The actual round is
14.5x146.7mm (necked).  For the sake of brevity (or just sanity) the
extra .7mm of cartridge length got lost, resulting in a loss of 157.957J.

For your amusement, here\'s the posting that started it all.  Please note
that I was using a playtest edition of FF&S, and references to the
capabilities of FGMP and PGMPs, as well as Battle Dress, Combat Armor,
Grav Tank, and G-Carrier all refer to the versions of these items as
originally published in T:TNE (and not after revision, correction, or
outright re-design).

My feeling with the "Crunch Gun" would be to use the game statistics (range,
penetration, damange, and so on) as presented in the RCEG, but use the mass
of the "real thing" - FF&S makes the weapon come out far too massive to be
really practical!

My original message is set off with vertical bars; comments I\'ve added
at a later date are inserted where appropriate.  Enjoy!

Note: When converting "Real-World" weapons to FF&S, it is usually best to
ignore the real-life cartridge length, and vary the length of the FF&S
design until you achieve the closest "average" energy.  Depending on your
source of "Real-World" ballistics data, you _may_ have to iterate through
the barrel design (to find the actual energy of your cartridge for a FF&S
barrel the same length as the real-world test barrel).  Another tactic,
which is used by GDW in some of their designs, is to hold the cartridge
dimensions to their real-world values, and vary the tech-level.  However,
given the particulars of this weapon (WWII-era Soviet Union), I felt that
crediting them with an unusually high TL to raise the energy of the
cartridge would be stretching things a little too much.

With a bit of algebra, formulae to make such conversions relatively
straightforward are possible, but slightly beyond what I feel like typing
at this hour.  Perhaps in a follow-up article.  :-)

| 
| All in all, I\'m not really very happy with this FF&S design; the weapon
| came out more than twice as heavy as it should have (a hundred-and-fifteen

| and heavy, and if you push on the low end, you get things like 10mm (cal) 
| by 3mm (long) cartridges and guns that are much too light.

The final version of the FF&S rules only make things worse, actually.  At
52.746kg (116.3lbs!) for the loaded rifle alone, this is much, MUCH too
heavy!  The real-world weapon, bipod and all, weighs less than the FF&S
reciever alone.
  
| Tactical Considerations:
| The close range of this weapon exceeds the extreme range of every fusion
| gun except the FGMP-14 and -15, and the short range equals or exceeds the
| extreme range of any of the fusion guns.  The best use of these weapons
| would be long-range fire at the attackers, from behind cover (preferably
| cover strong enough to resist an extreme-range fusion gun strike) or
| sniping from outside the range of their weapons.  If this is impossible 
| (and it frequently is), then a series protected positions likeley to
suprise 
| the enemy are good (around a corner in a corridor, for example).
| 
| Game Use:
| This weapon (or rather, one using the "real world" stats and not the FF&S
| design, which is completely impractical) could be quite useful to anti-RC
| forces in the New Era.  A relatively low-tech design, it is quite capable
| of being manufactured by many worlds in the Wilds.  Although the DS
| ammunition is probably going to be considerably harder to produce, there
| will probably be a number of worlds equipped with it.  As Star Viking
| activities expand, it is very likeley that traders operating in the wilds
| will find a demand for this type of weapon.
| 
| Several adventure plotlines are possible around this weapon; one which 
| suggests itself to me is probably obvious.  The players (RCES or \'Lancers) 
| attempt a smash-n-grab on some TL-5 to TL-7 dictator.  They expect an easy 
| time of it.  Pull this one on your players after they\'ve done two or three 
| of the same type of missions in a row and have had a chance to get 
| overconfident and complacent.  Suprise them with the weapon; without the DS

| ammunition, it shouldn\'t be too deadly, but should (if employed well) be 
| able to prevent the PCs from accomplishing some or all of their objectives.

| Drive home to them in a practical sort of way how difficult their lives 
| would be if lots of worlds had them.  Later developments in the campaign
can
| involve efforts to stop free traders from spreading the guns (or the
designs)
| around the area.  Another one might have to do with discovering that
someone

There you go ... a "fixed" Crunch Gun!  :-)

One point you should bear in mind is that the extremes of the TL scale
correspond to longer periods of time than in the middle. ie it took Terra
thousands of years to go from TL 0 to 1, whereas it only took a decade to
go from 7 to 8.

However, I agree that most worlds unaffected by Virus should have gone up
a bit by now - don\'t forget that the old data dates from the Second Survey
(1065, IIRC), so this was over 50 years old even by the time of the
Rebellion!

Just a minor quibble (as I desperately try to catch up on digests)...  I
was the one who suggested the title; a saying attributed to Queen
Victoria, I believe.

Anyway, to add a non-data-point to the survey, my campaign is on hold
and therefore doesn\'t qualify, but I\'ve been using a non-Rebellion
background (non-5th-F-W, actually).  I\'d certainly welcome a Classic
Imperium sourcebook (but then, these days I buy all new Traveller
material because of the number of times I\'ve kicked myself for not
buying older stuff when it first came out).  The reason the campaign
is on hold is to shift over to TNE rules, of course. :-)

Ditto. My version includes the worlds from Chamanx Plague/Horde and has links
to 
Die Weltbund of Paranoia Press\' original Beyond sector.

Admittedly, I had Die Weltbund split up and begin a civil war because of a 
fanatical dictator with a trim black moustache... oh come on, the whole thing

was crying out for this sort of treatment - I mean, I had him living at
Shloss 
Adler in the Beyond !! %-)

(I do eventually want to move my worlds to GDW\'s positions...eventually, 
sometime...)

In fact, the whole thing was a bit creepy; AFTER creating my sector, I read
the 
Beyond and found out that I had placed Robert Asprin\'s "Thieves World" just 4

parsecs from where PP had! (insert "Twilight Zone" music here).

That\'s a very small sample. My statistics are a bit rusty, but with the
number of widely different types of planets you have, 30 or so is much
too low a sample to give any meaningful data. If just one of those
planets are atypical it throws off the results.

You base this on one out of one capital planet and one out of one industrial
planet. That is not... ah, how can I put it delicately... not sound
statistics. The same goes for the rest of your conclusions.

Efate, Glisten, Mora, and Rhylanor; which two are not even possibly
survivors into the New Era?

Ah, Andrew, you\'ve just pushed one of my pet Traveller buttons. You and
Mr. Watters both make the same huge mistake: You ignore the difference
between discovering new technology and applying it. Take the Spinward
Marches anno 1105-1115, the time where Mr. Watters gets the first half
of his data (or even 1065 if you maintain that the data we get in the
CT books are un-updated Second Survey). With the exception of the score
of interdicted worlds EVERY SINGLE WORLD HAS ACCESS TO TL 15 _KNOWLEDGE_.
The Imperium has been solidly TL 15 for centuries. Even the poorest world
would have had the money to pay for a set of basic textbooks (As a matter
of fact I believe that the Imperium actually gave away technological info
for free  -  or am I thinking of a variant article somewhere?). So why
aren\'t they all TL 15? One reason is that they voluntarily restricted
themselves to a lower tech. That\'s fine for explaining the odd pre-
industrial world, but I don\'t think it will work for more than a few.
The other possible reason is economic. They can\'t afford it. It follows
from this that any change in TL (with the possible exception of the
change from TL 15 to 16) depends on how the planet has done financially
over the past 80 years.

As we saw in one offshoot of the "What is a Feudal Technocracy" debate, we
don\'t have enough data to say very much about the overall economy of the
Spinward Marches. Once the New Era Spinward Marches sourcebook is out we
may be able to say more. But unless the overall economy of the Spinward
Marches has improved, any TL increase of one world (representing an improved 
economy) could well be linked to a TL drop somewhere else (representing a 
worsening economy as the other world takes away its trade).

I\'d put it differently. There has certainly been quite enough time for any
world to increase in TL. But wether they actually have, or wether they\'ve
most of them stayed the same or even fallen, depends on what GDW decides 
(Or, in the case of our private campaigns, what we decide). TL increases 
and decreases are equally easy to justify. 

I did once calculate the return on investment you would get from buying and
operating a Subsidized Liner. Unless I\'ve made a mistake somewhere (which
is all too likely) it works out at roughly 3% per year. For that sort of
return to be a good one the inflation rate must be very low, which I
believe indicates a stable economy. That seems reasonable for the pre-
Rebellion Imperium. After the Rebellion all bets are off.

I am well aware that the sample is small, but as the Regina Subsector was the

only Regency subsector I could get my hands on, I thought I\'d give it a go. 
Besides, as the only surviving imperial economy is the Regency, 30 or so
worlds isn\'t that low a sample. Also, just using common sense, where are the 
places on our planet that technical innovations are lightly to occur? In
the industrial sector, and these innovations are researched, in some cases,
in universities, which capitals usually have a lot of. You don\'t need 
statistics if you can draw a sound analogy.

I know that Efate, Glisten, Mora, and Rhylanor are in existence in MT times,
but as \'The Rape of Trin\' shows, no world can be assured an existence in the
New Era. As to "which two are not even possibly survivors into the New Era",
I fear you may have misunderstood what I wrote.

I know that EVERY SINGLE WORLD HAS ACCESS TO TL 15 _KNOWLEDGE_. I take TL 
classifications to mean \'the TL that that particular world can sustain
on its own\'. One reason that a world doesn\'t have a high TL could be that
it is rich, to take the example of Saudi Arabia.It is rich,has modern 
facilities, well equipped armed forces, access to TL 8 knowledge, 
sustainable tech? Tl 4, 5. Still, it is an integrated part of a TL 8
world.
I also know the difference between discovering new technology and applying
it.
It\'s called getting it out of the lab and into the market place. It involves
finding an application for the new technology, an economic way of producing
it, and selling it to the customers. I\'d say that would be likely to occur
on the Industrial and possibly Capital worlds.

So in conclusion, can we please discuss, not lecture. I won\'t if you won\'t!

This installation uses an array of ten area jamming drones, held in 
formation around a central ship, or convoy, to provide almost 
impenetrable protection against all sensors. The individual drones
are also well protected, as the easy detection of active emissions 
from any one emitter is prevented by the jamming effects of the other
nine drones.
This was designed during the Black War when ship assets began to
become more scarce and more valuable. This was originally fitted
to troop carriers engaging in planetary strikes, to provide protection
from naval forces on the approach to the target. The sudden appearance of 
intense static fields at the edge of a system soon began to strike fear
into the inhabitants, as they sat helplessly waiting for the battleships 
to uncloak above the planet.
However it was soon adopted by larger merchant vessels, as it provided 
a very effective defence against corsairs.
The combined effects of the ten jammers around the parent ship is to make
all sensor tasks virtually impossible both to and from the ship. 
This would make the ship as helpless as a black globe, but maneuver is
still possible, although it is limited to 1G in this basic installation
by the thrusters on the drones.
This is not really a \'stealth\' technology, the massive ball of static
would be visible through almost any passive array, but locking onto
anything within the deep static cloak would be impossible. Ships
attacking cloaked ships would need to deploy fighter sweeps through
the field, destroying any drones they meet to allow larger vessels outside 
the field a chance to engage. Even then, it could take several hours for 
the ships to be located, by which time either the jump point or target 
planet could have been reached. Attackers would have to search a sphere
of space 90,000km across, in which the cloaked vessel could be hiding
anywhere, not just at the centre, as it can move independently of the 
drones.
Several of these cloaks have survived into the New Era aboard vampire
ships, and the Coalition possesses the technology to make more of them,
However, the high cost and fairly large size will mean that they are
not by any means common.

TL12 Deep Static Cloak
Price  :168.6MCr (includes 10 drones at 16.83MCr ea)
Power  :0.3Mw (for MasCom - drones are self contained)
Volume :371kl (26.5 ton bay)
Mass   :822.72tonnes (loaded)
Surface:161m2

Includes:
1x Spacious hanger for drone maintenance
9xDocking ring for drone storage
10xLaunch port
Workstation for operator
300,000km MasCom for drone guidance

TL12 Jamming Drone
Price    :18.7Mcr
Volume   :28kl
Mass     :80ton
Maneuver :1G, 8G-turns
Armour   :36
Power    :24.4Mw Fusion, 6month duration
Commo    :30,000km MasCom (intended to operate close to parent ship)

I designed this more like a spaceship than a missile,
It uses HEPlAR thrusters, so it is completely reusable, and could
be refuelled from the parent ship if necessary.

As far as I can tell, there is no limit to how many area jammers
can add their effects together, this configuration provides 
+10 diff mods to sensing tasks at the parent ship, and +8 to each drone.

At higher TLs, basic facilities such as presented above could be cheaply
fitted into much smaller spaces. I don\'t think there would be any need
to increase the number of drones significantly in larger versions, what
would be more useful would be to use larger drones with higher G-ratings
and larger areas of effect, to give the parent ship more space to hide
from fighter sweeps in.

Perhaps sensor drones with tight beam laser/maser communications could
be kept outside the jamming area to provide information on enemy positions
to the parent ship, even if not sensor locks. This could allow ships to
close range, drop the cloak and then engage with meson weapons, range no
longer being an important tactical consideration. Several short range
passive sensors would be more useful than one large one, as they would 
provide more opportunities for sensor locks.

I\'m fairly new to TML, so sorry if someone else has thought of this 
already, but I don\'t have time to read through all the archived digests.

Heck, inflation should be flat just \'cuz I don\'t want to worry about it
when I\'m playing games! :)

I did a similar calculation of the return on investment that the TAS
needs to get to hand out a high passage ticket to all members every eight
weeks, which works out to six and a half tickets a year.  Based on the 
MCr 1 fee, and assuming they pay full price for ticket vouchers from the 
Ministry of Transportation, they need to earn 6.5% interest on that 
megacredit every year.  I guess they don\'t invest in Sub Liners!  :)
Of course, the Imperial government may give the TAS a bulk discount on
the vouchers in order to foster interstellar commerce -- in a sense,
a subsidy on passenger travel.  

Of course, the TAS has other income streams -- presumably, local news
services pay them a fee to reprint stories off the TNS news wire, and
they may get some small amount of money for sales of educational holo
travellogues and any services that they don\'t offer at cost at the
hostels.  Also, they\'ve been operating since just after 700 or so, 
so the TAS can also develop an endowment from the membership fess of
past members who have since died.  They could always have a fund-
raising drive too, I suppose.  :)

The source I know for robot design rules are a CT extension published in the
first few JTAS (and re-published in best of 1)  Doubtless there is an MT
source as well.  Doubtless all to be renderred obsolete by FF&S II.

The main problem with those rules was that you could build robots with
inhumanly high skill levels (pilot-8, gunner-10) which made human crews
almost redundant.  I kept the design rules out of player hands because of
this, and used robot for comic relief (like the steward-8 serving droid who
followed one player around like a lost puppy because he kept asking for
incredibly exotic gormet meals)

I would LOVE to hear abut a more recent version available for download.

2. As it was explained to me, data reduction is now going on for the
Hipparchus mission, which will give paralaxes out to 80 parsecs or so.  I
have seen nothing available for download available on that, however, and if
anyone has and more recent information, please let me know.

I think this would make an interesting setting for a near-future campaign.

I didn\'t write up Glisten: Jeff Zetlin did.  He\'s the man to ask.
If you\'re interested in RICE paper\'s, check out the site on ghost: Deneb 
is still the all-round favourate (at least until I can squeese the time 
to do another... after I finally manage to automate most of the math, a job 
comes along!  Why do these petty distractions come along just when I am 
about to really start travelling?)

I am hoping (eventually) to get around to do a paper on Vincennes: this 
certainly won\'t be based on the Traveller Digest article.  Any future 
paper (from me) on Regina will be based on what little scraps I can get 
from the World Builder\'s Digest and the Scout\'s book (Classic: thank\'s, 
whoever it was who answered my question on Regina\'s system.)

Well, maybe I should wait until GDW comes out with a new Regina system in 
their long-awaited Regency book (July...July...July...)

You know, I am still astounded by the Kinnur claim!  Can you imagine how 
a ship with 30 (thereabout) marines (armed with laser rifles, by the 
Emperor\'s name!) can put down \'any threat to the Imperial peace\'?

First If you try multiple broadband jammers in formation in present 
technology you will be dead and long forgotten.  Present sensor
technology has the ability to discrimate between multiple jammers of 
the same type. That means that the sensor can pick out each separate 
jammer. Then you will get a ARM sent down your throat so to speak. A 
good percentage of todays missiles and sensors have the ability to 
"Track On Jam", which makes them even more accurate. Your convoy 
would be moving blind to anything outside objects (read ships, 
missiles, and debris). Even if I could not discrimate your jammers, I 
could send a missile with a large(read 500Mt+ Therm Nuc Warhead) 
along your path and detonate within proximity of your convoy. Your 
ship would not be able to detect it until after it detonated. In the 
present TNE rules jammers are still a joke. There are essentially 
three types of jammers, but the TNE jamming rules only take into 
effect one type of jammer. You have illustrated a very good example 
of the limited implementation that TNE uses jamming for. If you wish 
to go for the TNE rules your use has a very good uses. But have 
discarded and put into use my own house rules that do not have a 
limited jamming techniques.

Agreed, up to a point. Even when they haven\'t actually gone up a TL, worlds
will replace a lot of equipment every year (especially the military). A
lot of this will be out of date, but still usable, and often it\'s cheaper
to give it away than to dismantle/recycle/bury it yourself. Even a world
that\'s done pretty badly might get hold of this, if it was conveniently
close to a higher-tech one.

I had a play around with this - the main problem was that the thing was
too light, so the recoil was enormous, (I fixed this by just bolting on
an extra kg or two of metal). I\'ll try to remember where I put the stats...

The ARMs would be significant threat to the drones, I agree. The price of
an area jammer makes a disposable approach uneconomical, so instead we need
to increase their survivability. They are already designed like spaceships,
so it would not be hard to add on anti missile lasers, or even a sandcaster,
even though this would increase the size of the installation, probably to
around a 100 ton bay. Tracking incoming missiles could be tricky, though. 
(Better idea:)
As I understand it (although my knowledge is patchy)
modern ARMs have little trouble tracking active targets, and some have target
memory if the transmitter shuts down. However, as far as I know, they don\'t
cope so well if the target shuts down and moves out of the way. If, say, 
twenty drones were used, only half would need to be active to maintain the
cloak. This would mean that drones could shut down in turn, make a small
evasion burn, and then come back on line. The time between these shutdowns
could be as little as a minute or less. This would make it much harder to
shoot these things down with an ARM, as the chances are that the target could
move outside the seeker head\'s field of view inactive. The extra reaction
mass needed for this evasion maneuvering would increase the volume of the
drone and decrease its endurance, but it could still work this way.
My use of \'formation\' in my original description was unfortunate, I just
liked
the mental image. The above describes something which is definitely not 
formation flying.

I think my use of \'formation\' has hidden part of my original intention. 
The ship is free to maneuver and hide anywhere within the cloak, which is an 
area of space 90,000km in diameter. The chance of hitting the cloaked ship
would 
be minimal with most nuclear warheads. To stand a chance of doing some
damage, 
you need a warhead with a destruction radius in the order of 10,000km.
Although
FFS doesn\'t have warheads this big, it is possible to get a very rough
figure:

Destruction radius is around 42*sqrt(Yield kt) for the larger warheads.
It is more than this for the smaller ones, so if anything, this will 
underestimate the yield necessary.
We want a destruction radius of 10,000,000m. This gives a required yield of
50,000,000,000kt, or 50 million Megatons. This warhead alone would cost
500 million megacredits. If you\'ve got a warhead this big, then forget the
supply convoy to the military base, nuke the entire planet with the base on
instead! 

So there we have it, bigger, more expensive and less effective than
I had hoped, but still (just about) possible.
Or course, as I know nothing about military hardware, there could well be
something wrong with these solutions, feel free to correct me.

This could be even more interesting used to cloak a planet. Jammers could be
put in deep sites, each linked to several antennae to reduce vulnerability to
ARM attack. A planetary economy could also afford this sort of system.
It would, however, ruin TV reception, everything would need to be done with
fibre optics, and possibly Laser relays, which could probably avoid most
interference from jamming (as far as I understand it, tight beam
communications
can still work under jamming, in space the problem is knowing where to point
your transmitter if you can\'t achieve sensor locks).
Why would you want to do this to your lovely planet? I can suggest three 
reasons:
A/To hide Naval assests on a desert world (no oceans to hide in). There would
be a problem alerting these forces to an attack. Some sort of signal would
need
to be arranged which doesn\'t need fine sensor targetting. I like the idea
of firing a laser down at a mountaintop or desert (fine targetting not 
necessary). The pillar of light from the sky should be visible from a fair 
(safe) distance away
B/To provide defence for naval assets, orbital habitats or merchant traffic. 
This could be a very important consideration to worlds with large numbers of 
civilians working in space.
C/For a bit of a laugh.

  I picked it up yesterday from (plug plug) The Compleat
  Strategist, on East 33d st just of Fifth, in the Rotten Apple.  I 
  was disappointed to see that it did not rate posting on their 
  "Coming/Came attractions" board - the first TNE product that
  wasn\'t so featured.  OTOH, I was told that they had come in that
  day, so they may simply not have had time tp update the 
  display...

  Anyway, the first thing I saw was the cover - not an unreasonable 
  thing to expect to see first.  That was slightly disappointing.  
  It was the same "sinister face made of circuit tracings" that has 
  been prominent in the black-and-white ads in previous products  
  The colorization of the picture, however, seemed to be designed
  to obscure the circuit-tracing nature of the portrait.  The 
  titling font was also not what was used in the ads.  Oh, well,  I 
  think consistency in this would have been nice, but let\'s look at 
  the contents - they\'re more important.

  The book is organized into six sections - three sections of game 
  source material, each of which is followed by a section of 
  adventure source material.  The three adventures dovetail into a 
  single campaign, and each adventure uses Virus as a principal 
  NPC.  Each section of game source material provides useful/needed
  background information for the adventure material immediately 
  following, and the adventure material provides a reasonable 
  insight into the game source material.

  The third section of game source material contains an extended 
  design sequence for creating robots, optionally including a 
  "personality" for Virus-infected (NPC) robots.  No provisions for 
  creating a Virus-PC are included, although the book does "stop 
  short of saying [that it is] impossible".  I have not compared 
  this sequence with any other extant robot-creation sequences, 
  though I do note that it is conceptually compatible with the 
  general FFS sequence for designing vehicles (I don\'t remember
  what, if anything, existed in FFS for robots...).

  As befits the general topic, there is much opportunity for a 
  party of PCs to interact with Virus on an extended-time basis,
  and in several modes.  The focus, as with most TNE material to 
  date, is on a Coalition-based campaign, and information on 
  converting to a Pocket Empire or Regency campaign is sketchy at 
  best.  Hiver involvement in this aspect of the Coalition campaign 
  has been downplayed to a point I find difficult to accept, given
  what we have been told before - if anything, I would have 
  expected a much higher level of Hiver participation, as it is the 
  Hivers who best survived the spread of Virus, and who would have 
  the most knowledge of it.

  The general feel of the book seems to imply that Virus is a major 
  danger to the Coalition - something that we intellectually knew 
  before, perhaps, but previous material did not make it appear to 
  be as much of a threat as this book does.  I hope I haven\'t 
  discovered a "discontinuity check".  For what it\'s worth, the 
  calendar appeared to be in mid-1202, and there are two _dated_
  quotations that may lock GDW into a timetable - one extends
  Coalition rights to all sentients, including artificials, in
  1204, and one indicates that contact with the Regency will be 
  made in or by 1206 - with distinct implications that it will 
  _not_ be an open-arms-buddy-buddy-how-nice-we\'re-not-alone 
  celebration.  Loren, where\'s the Regency sourcebook for this 
  period immediately prior to contact, fercryinoutloud?

  For those who have been keeping up with Challenge magazine and 
  other GDW source material on the New Era, there is other clear 
  evidence that the Coalition is becoming much more active outside 
  the AO, or that the AO itself is expanding.

  Overall, I feel it is well-presented.  There is reason within to 
  cause players and PCs to possibly re-think their most-likely- 
  -black-and-white-Virus-is-EVIL views, just like the CT Zhodani
  alien module did for the most-likely-black-and-white-Zhodani-
  -and-psionics-are-EVIL views back then.  It\'s a decent read in
  and of itself (if you\'re like me - YMMV otherwise).  My primary
  complaint is that it is perhaps a little _too_ focussed on the 
  Coalition interaction with Virus - I\'d have liked to see 
  additional sections briefly discussing the differences between 
  the Coalition approach toward Virus and the Regency attitude, and 
  the incidents that shaped them.  As it stands, this is definitely 
  a Coalition sourcebook, and less desirable to a Pocket Empire or 
  Regency campaign.

  On a Five-Best scale, I give it a 3.5-to-4.0 for Coalition GMs,
  subtract about 0.5 for a Pocket Empire GM, and subtract 
  1.0-to-1.25 for a Regency GM.

Sooner than that.  _Vampire Fleets_ have hit the stores.  (I wrote
"has" the first time, but the last sentence is more fun this way.) 

Details from a quick look in the shop:
$16.00 US, and about the same length as _Hiver and Ithklur_.
It\'s about half adventure and half sourcebook.

The book talks about virus psychology and motivations, and how to 
generate virus "characters" and random vampire fleets.  More info
on Diaspora subsectors is included.  Robot generation design rules
are included, and while I didn\'t look real closely at them, they
look like mutants of DGP\'s rules.  Deck plans for a _Midu Agashaam_
are included, at the annoying new two-meter scale, of course.

There are also rules for Virus infection electronic combat.  A
Virus attack can be resisted, and driven off, at the least by
other viruses.  

The campaign is entirely RC/Sufren region based, and the book is
clearly geared for RC-type folks.  The RC has apparently suffered
some setbacks -- besides Solee and their other problems, it seems 
that Virus-infected ships have suddenly noticed the Coalition....

One of the bits of art, just inside the back cover, surprised me
a bit.  Anyone else here seen the blocky-pixel computer-generated
art from old "CT book" pamphlet-sized issues of _Travellers\'
Digest_?  An illo for an equipment sheet looked a lot like one 
of those.

Obligatory advertisement in the back for the Regency sourcebook,
_Keepers of the Flame_, with an advertised release date of July.

Well here are some of my Fusion Pistol designs.  I also have to add 
extra weight to my fusion pistols to get the recoil down.  While I was 
at it I created some Gauss Pistols for comparison.  BTW I tend to

I think with the heavier weapons that if may character had the 
strength for it I would use the Fusion Pistol.  The range isn\'t as 
good, but it\'s a little lighter and it look real COOL in combat.

I hope some of you find this useful.  I create all the weapon designs 
with some Visual Basic programs I wrote, so should you find any errors 
please feel free to let me know so that I can fix my programs.

   Ever noticed that there are no distinct descriptions of hyperspace travel?
The Starship Operators Manual Vol.1 (was there ever a Vol.2 ? - I\'d sure like
to have it :-) does some work on i, but is not all to precise...
   Well anyway, I recently spent some thoughts on that topic, and thats what

I\'ve come up with:


1. Transition:

   The _SOM_ tells us, that the entire surface of the ship is laced with a
net
of Lanthanum, or some alloy of it. In one of the oldtimer sidebars an example
is given, where one of the grid elements is ruptured and jumpspace extended
*into* the ship. I really ask myself how badly mangled combat vesseles manage
to get safely through jumpspace, without loosing major parts of their hull.
At least I imagine, that a lot of grid joints get destroyed under fire...
   Of course the optical effect is pretty cool, but then the entire thing
doesn\'t seem all too plausible to me. Has someone of you guys out there a
better idea?
   I, for my part, tend to use a totally differrent approach to jump drives:
Like the Contra-Grav modules the jump drive creates a field of sub-atomic
particles out to a certain radius. These particles are very heavy, but do
not interact with matter, and the decay after only some microseconds into
a dozen other sub-atomic particles. Thus under normal circumstances the JD
would just produce a vast amount of particles floating away from the ship
like a solar wind. However these particles have a critical density. Once a
certain number of them occupy the same volume in space, the tend to
interfere with each other, forming a uncountable number of small gravitic
lenses for other particles to pass. Once this pattern is established, the
second stage of transition is to come. Now another part of the JD produces
one enourmous second flare of another kind of particles, which gets focussed 
by the sub-atomic grav-lenses, into a chain reaction producing small areas of

immense energetic density. This oversaturation is the cause for the space-
time-continuum to rupture momentarily, and throw the ship into jumpspace.
   While the lanthanum net helps to control the flow of the particles it
is not necessary to operate the jump drive. However a severly damaged hull
will result in very unsure jump conditions, increasing the chance of misjump.


2. In Jumpspace:

   Again the _SOM_ tells us about jumpspace that it is a grey "nothingness"
. This seems to be not to physically correct either. While I really don\'t
have the slightest idea what jumpspace physics might be like, I guess, that
it is not too wrong to assume that some elementary laws of physics may still
not be violated. The one law I mean in particular is the law of the
conversation of energy. Assuming that the normal-space bubble that travels
with the ship through J-Space is still somehow part of the N-universe, (and
it definetly will be again after reentry),  I find that no energy can leave
or enter this bubble. If it could, the total energy of the universe would
be altered, when the n-space bubble rejoins it. Therefore the bubble may
definetly *not* look grey, as that would mean, that either part of the energy
emitted by the ship gets absorbed, or that the wall emits small amounts of
radiation into the bubble. If energy was to be conserved however, all energy 
produced by the ship *must* return to it. In other words the barrier must
either be a *perfect* black radiator (or whatever you english speaking guys 
may call it...) or a totally reflective wall.
   I prefer the last option, as I find the image of a slowly wobbeling
giant aluminum foil around a starship pretty cool.
   This of course means as well, that the starship can turn its heating
down. As all energy gets transformed into heat by the time, the starship
will be slowly getting warmer, as it resides inside the jump-bubble, and
the air-conditioning will have to work a lot to keep it cool inside.
   Therfore a ship emerging from J-space will be definetly hot. Quite
something to think about, if you want to sneak into some system, and you\'re
some hundred kelvin above zero.


3. Optical effects:

3.1 Transition

   I imagine transition as follows: first the lanthanum net gets warmed up.
This can only by seen in the infrared spectrum. Then the JD begins to
produce the particle stream number one. In the vicinity of the lanthanum
grid particle decay is accelerated, which in turn produces a blue light as
described in the _SOM_. The steady decay may also be noticed as a slight
bluish haze around the ship. Other wavelengths also show signatures.
   When JD produces the ignition flare, particles will decay in wild
patterns around the ship for about a second or so. Then the ship will
simply be gone with one last shed of particles and radiation.
    Note that the bluish haze will only be found outside the ship, beyond
the lanthanum grid.

3.2 Inside the Bubble

   As described the bubbles wall will either appear as a totally black
wall, emitting IR (you wouldn\'t want it to glow grey!) or a totally plain
(or even cooler a wobbeling) super-reflective surface.

3.3 Reentry

   This on is just a small shed of particles and radiation, followed by the
appearance of a warm ship.

4. Side effects

   Hm... ever wondered what happened to the matter, where the ship appears.
Well I guess, it will somehow get displaced, as the n-space bubble gets
inserted into the universe again, producing a small shockwave. I could be
turned into pure radiation as well, but this will happen to small molecules
only, as the seem to be the only matter that does not count in the 100
diameter rule, so there will not be much of an effect in both cases.
   Another question is, what happens if something outside the ship just
protudes into the jump field, when transtion occurs. I could imagine that
it somehow gets torn apart, i.e. one part ramains in n-space, while the 
other one, neatly seperated, travels into j-space.
   Another interesting thought is, what happens if you *touch* the bubble.
I guess it feels like touching a super-hard surface, that has the same
temparature as you, when you touch it. However *nothing* will be able to
penetrate it, and matter will just bounce back, as it comes into contact. 
   I guess you could basically fill the bubble with air!


Well that\'s enough for it... This was my first contribution to this Network,
so I would be very glad to recieve comments from You.

the range is quite limited, and its weight had to be signifigantly increased
to account for a low enough recoil to be usable by characters with more arm
strength than average.  Here\'s the stats:

the fusion gun design sequence in the book is very simple: fusion guns don\'t
have barrels.  everything is based on discharge energy.  depending on how
deadly your campaign is, you might consider changing the rof figures back to
1, which is what the book actualy suggests (due too LN purge cycles and
avoiding thermal fatigue cracking of the firing unit, etc) i left it higher
to offset the small size of the unit being likely to require less time to
cool.

AOL\'s Mailing List database is pretty out of date.....

Send mail to:   listproc@mpgn.com

In the body say:

subscribe traveller Your Name

And you are subscribed.  Once subscribed, to contribute, just send mail to:
    traveller@mpgn.com

We also have the xboat list which a discussion of Classic and MegaTraveller.

Same procedures as above, but substitute xboat for traveller.

I maintain the list.

Notes:

A common design within and near the Solomani Confederation, the Standard
Shipyards J3 Trader was built in large numbers before the Collapse.  A
cheaper Jump-2 variant, with increased cargo space was also produced in
large numbers.  The other major variant on this design was the \'William
Dampier\' Class of exploration / survey vessels.  The \'Dampiers were fitted
with jump-5 drives and a vastly upgraded sensor suite, at the expense of
most of the cargo space.  Designed for exploration and survey work in the
Rimreach, Phlange and Tracerie Sectors, the \'William Dampier\' class were
usually armed.

A few examples of the J3 Trader survive into the New Era.  The Near Bootes
Commonwealth retains a couple of examples as VIP transports, the rest have
passed into private hands.

I\'m around and have a campaign which started not too long
ago, and I know where to go to look for some others.
I live in Berkeley right now, and there\'s a great notices
board at Games of Berkeley for ongoing campaigns etc.

Of course, there is the disadvantage that I have been known
to test out things which end up in Challenge on innocent
players in my normal campaigns...

Hi,

I was going through my TML weapons while making some ships, and I found a few
errors... just thought anyone plugging and chugging with them should know.

The TL-12 Heavy Laser Bay posted by Michael Llaneza is said to look like
this:

BL:	10:(-2) 735-1/235, 20: etc.

it should be 10:(-2) 71-1/something (I don\'t have my calculator handy).  The
I was calculated wrong... round to .01, but anything less than 1=1!!  (your
calculation is right, except for that (The note about discharge being
multiplied
doesn\'t happen).

I know i Jumped on the planetary mount, but I missed this one (I\'m posting
some
BR designs you all can jump on soon, BTW :)

Also, Michael Bailey posted a TL-14 Meson Gun that he called a "Light Meson
Gun"
.. the 10,000 ton ship that carries it would *have* to be open frame to be
long
enough to carry this critter (just in case anyone describes the ship to some 
players :)

On a related note, it would be nice to see the discharge energy in the
designs,
since listing the power makes me wonder if that is for ROF=10, 50, or
whatever

You may wonder why I bothered to include the PP volume... I\'ve been working
out
a "make a quick BR ship" setup, and by lumping the PP volume with systems
that
aren\'t a percentage of total volume, I can get the basic overhead volume
(jump,
mdrive, fuel, armor, LS, quarters, etc) in 2 or 3 steps, and just add
weapons, 
etc.----I made the ships in the next post in less than an hour (I leave a fair
bit of slop just in case, but BR is sloppy too, so I think the designs would
work out in FFS (doing a large number of 10 kton+ ships isn\'t what I feel 
like doing right now).

Armor	500
Jump	3

Fuel for 50 gturns + jump 3 (106 w jump fuel)

	EMM Msk
	Various other sensors (densitometer, ladars, etc)

I gave myself these out of the 7211 tons left over (all the sensors\'d fit in
something like 15 tons)

The remaining volume is for ships boats, and slop.


This isn\'t all that tight a design.  It would be safe to add about 5 gturns
to
this guy (a few more if the mdrive is a fusion rocket).  It could be jump 4,
but
it\'s really tight (only 1211 tons left as slop).

The following is the sensors.html file in text format.  I am wary of trying
to establish copyright on a file which is so extensively dependent on a prior
work.  Insert  std.disclaimer here, but note that any ideas that are not
GDW\'s or Merrick Burkhardt\'s are mine.







Sensors in Space Combat

I have incorporated the following deviations from Traveller: The New Era.

   *  Stealth,  EMM and black globe have no effect on the detection task if
the target uses active sensors or expends G turns.
   *  White globe has the effect of black globe against active sensors only.
   *  A  ship  which  relies on batteries or fuel cells to provide power is
always treated as in cold mode.
   *  Sensor difficulty increases are expanded to include crossing movement
and heading across the sun.
   *  The  base  difficulty  to hit a target is never better than the final
difficulty to detect the target.
   *  Ships  which  do  not expend G turns are easier to hit, especially if
they cannot or will not expend G turns.

Thanks to Merrick Burkhardt <merrick@Rt66.com> for ideas with the following
changes (v1.1):

   * The base difficulty to hit a target is now never better than the final
difficulty  to  scan  the  target.   This  makes active sensors more useful
again.
   *  Tech level is now only known with a outstanding success on the target
detection.
   * Active signature is now dependent on active sensor short range.  This
allows ships to vary their active sensor range to increase or reduce their
active signature.
   * Active sensors and area jammers may be detected from any range.
   * In line with this, active sensors may be varied in terms of tech level
and  headings.   The  hex  facings  on  which  active  sensors are used are
nominated when the ship declares itself active.
   * Within short range and beyond maximum range, diff mods halve or double
effective range, so that detection is always possible if sufficiently
close, and sometimes possible beyond extreme range.


Sensory Information

	What  types  of  sensory  information does a sensor pick up about a
target?   There  are  five  significant  ways  of detecting another ship in
space:   occulation, radiant energy, reflected energy, active emissions and
exhaust.  Information about ship heading and velocity which is required for
targetting solutions is built up by multiple detections through any and all
of  these methods.  Occulation occurs when the target obstructs the passage
of  light  from  a  background  star.   This can give information about its
displacement  and  shape  if  sufficient  occulations  occur.  Black globe,
stealth  and EMM may not prevent occulations from occuring.  Radiant energy
occurs  when the ship uses power.  The target radiates heat and radio waves
from  the  generation of power by the powerplant, and the operation of ship
systems.   Stealth  and  EMM  are  effective  in  dampening and redirecting
radiant  energy  to  disguise  the  target,  and black globe, but not white
globe,  prevents  them  being  radiated  at  all.   Radiant energy provides
additional  information  about  the  powerplant,  tech  level,  and  vessel
disposition and function.  Reflected energy occurs when active sensors pump
energy  at  the  target  and  attempt to detect reflections of this energy.
Reflection  energy gives information about target displacement, density and
shape.   Reflected energy also occurs from indirect reflections of sunlight
and  starlight,  at  a  much  lower  level.  Stealth and EMM technology are
designed  to  absorbed and minimise reflection of these energies, and black
and white globes absorb them completely.
	Active emissions from the active sensors themselves are much easier
to  detect then their reflections, as are the emissions of area jammers and
radio.   Higher  technology  active  sensors can minimise the bandwidth and
leakage  of  their sensor emissions, or use more exotic frequencies, making
them  harder to detect by lower technology ships.  Active emissions provide
information  about the sensor type and technology.  Active emissions cannot
however  be  effectively  masked by stealth or EMM technology at the ranges
required  in  space combat.  Exhaust from the ship\'s provides a much larger
target  to detect, typically up to 200 km long.  Although the energy of the
ship\'s  exhaust even after expelled into space is a lot greater than active
sensor  emissions,  it  does  not  radiate  this  energy  in all directions
equally.   The  exhaust  is  much easier to detect to the rear of the ship,
especially  stern  on  when changing velocity or heading.  Exhaust provides
information about the target\'s maneovour drive type and power.  Stealth and
EMM does not effectively mask the exhaust signature.


Signature

	The  signature  of  a  target  ship  gives  the  primary difficulty
modifier  to  the  detection task.  Use the easiest signature to detect for
each  sensing task, provided that the sensing player fulfills the necessary
requirements.
	The  ship\'s passive signature is always present.  It is detected by
radar, active EMS, ladar, HRT and passive EMS.  The passive signature maayy
vary for each kind of sensor, especially if the ship is equipped with
stealth or EMM.
	The  ship\'s active signature is present if the ship has gone active
this  turn.   It is detected by direction finder-equipped sensors including
passive EMS.
	The  ship\'s  area  jammer signature is present if the ship is using
its  area  jammer.   It  is  detected  by direction finder-equipped sensors
including passive EMS.
	The  ship\'s exhaust signature is present if the ship has expended 1
or more G turns this turn.  It is detected by HRT and passive EMS.

	    3-4		-3 Diff mod
	    5-8		-4 Diff mod
	    9-16	-5 Diff mod
	    etc.

	Active  sensor  short  range  includes radio short range.  Use a -5
Diff mod for area jammer signature.

	The  signature  table  incorporates  target  size  and  no  G turns
expended  modifiers.   Active  sensors have been redefined, but include the
gone active modifier.  If the target has as passive EMS array extended this
turn,  or socket extenders, or an external spinal mount, add -1 Diff mod to
the  passive signature against Radar and Active EMS only.  If the target is
in  cold mode or operating solely from batteries or fuel cells, add +1 Diff
mod to the passive signature against HRT and passive EMS only.
	For  passive  signature,  also incorporate target stealth or EMM or
black  globe.   The  best  difficulty modifier for the target player may be
chosen  from  this  table if both black globe or white globe and some other
form of ECCM is used.

		Target Passive Signature
				Ladar &
Target ECCM	Radar		Active EMS	HRT		Passive EMS
None		+0 Diff mod	+0 Diff mod	+0 Diff mod	+0 Diff mod
Stealth		+1 Diff mod	+0 Diff mod	+1 Diff mod	+0 Diff mod

Black globe:100	+5 Diff mod	+5 Diff mod	+2 Diff mod	+2 Diff mod
White globe	+5 Diff mod	+5 Diff mod	+0 Diff mod	+0 Diff mod

	Reduce the effectiveness of black globe against HRT and Passive EMS
only  by  1  Diff  mod if the ship is in cold mode or operating solely from
batteries  or  fuel  cells.   Below  an 80% flicker rate, black globe gives
little advantage over conventional EMM.

	For  active  signature,  give  +1 Diff mod per sensing TL below the
target  TL.   The  active  signature  on  a  ship may be varied by reducing
effective  short range, TL and headings used of the active sensor or radio.
This  must  be  determined  when  the active sensor or radio is used.  If a
reduced  short  range  is  used,  the  reduced short range must be used for
detection  tasks.   If  a  reduced TL is used, only the reduce TL has to be
announced,  allowing  a  ship  to  understate its TL when going active.  If
reduced  headings are used, the headings used should be marked.  The active
sensors  may  only  detect  ships  along those headings, and radio may only
communicate  along  those headings.  The active signature has a +1 Diff mod
per  heading  difference  between  the sensing ship and the nearest heading
used by the active sensor or radio.
eg
		      active
			\\_/
			 A     B
			
			 C

	Ship  A goes active on headings 11-1 (imagine a clockface).  It can
only detect targets in these headings.  Ship B is on heading 3 from ship A.
Ship  B  detects the active signature of ship A by using the active sig mod
with  an  additional  +2  Diff mod.  Ship C detects the active signature of
ship  A  by  using  the active sig mod with an additional +5 Diff mods.  Of
course,  it  is likely the passive or exhaust signature of ship A is easier
to detect for ship C.

	For exhaust signature, give -3 Diff mod if sensing player stern on.

	Record  the  signature  in  the  following form.  The target active
signature should be rated at the maximum active sensor range.

		Target Passive Signature
			Ladar
			Active		Passive
Diff Mods	Radar	EMS	HRT	EMS	Target		Target
Target size					Active		Exhaust
Target ECCM					Signature	Signature
---- ---- ---- ---- ----	----	----
Total								    /

	If necessary, include the modifier for using only batteries or fuel
cells  in  target size, and include variable levels of black globe in ECCM.
Include a seperate value for stern on exhaust signature.

eg  The  following table gives the signatures for a 100 ton scout.  It is a
Small ship (Passive Signature -1 Diff mod vs active sensors, +0 Diff mod vs
passive sensors, Exhaust Signature -1 Diff mod), equipped with a 300 000 km
Active  Sensor  (Range  10  hexes:   Active  Signature  -5  Diff  mod), a
folding passive array and electro-magnetic masking (EMM:  Passive Signature
-1  Diff  mod vs active and passive EMS, -2 Diff mod vs radar and HRT).  If
the  EMM  system  is damaged, the target ECCM should be lined out, and only
target size mods applied.

folding passive array deployed.
	The  scout  is quite stealthy when it is not moving or using active
sensors.   If  the  scout  is using G turns, it may safely power its active
sensors out to a short range of 1 (-1 Diff mod) without comprimising itself
unnecessarily.   Using  its active sensors to their full capacity gives the
scout  a signature equivelent to the exhaust signature of a 1 000 000 tonne
+ ship, or a 1 000 tonne + ship seen stern on.

eg  The  following  table  gives  the  signatures  for  a  10 000 ton cargo
freighter.   It  is  a  Large ship (Passive Signature -3 Diff mod vs active
sensors,  -2  Diff  mod vs passive sensors, Exhaust Signature -3 Diff mod),
equipped  with a 30 000 km Active Sensor (Range 1 hex:  Active Signature -1
Diff mod) and not masked.

		Target Passive Signature
			Ladar,
			Active		Passive

Target size	-3	-3	-2	-2	Active		Exhaust
Target ECCM	+0	+0	+0	+0	Signature	Signature
---- ---- ---- ---- ----	----	----
Total		-3	-3	-2	-2	-1		-3/-6

	The  cargo  freighter  is  alot easier to detect.  A designer could
note  that  the  range of the active sensors could be doubled without their
use comprimising the ship\'s signature at all when it goes active.


eg  The  following table gives the signatures for a 100 000 ton battleship.
It  is  a Very Large ship (Passive Signature -4 Diff mod vs active sensors,
-3  Diff  mod  vs passive sensors, Exhaust Signature -4 Diff mod), equipped
with  a 600 000 km Active Sensor (Range 20 hexes:  Active Signature -6 Diff
mod),  a  black  globe  capable  of a 10% flicker rate and electro-magnetic
masking  (EMM:  Passive Signature -1 Diff mod vs active and passive EMS, -2
Diff mod vs radar and HRT).

		Target Passive Signature
			Ladar,
			Active		Passive
Diff Mods	Radar	EMS	HRT	EMS	Target		Target
Target size	-4	-4	-3	-3	Active		Exhaust
Target ECCM	+2/+5	+1/+5	+2/+2	+1/+2	Signature	Signature
---- ---- ---- ---- ----	----	----
Total		-2/+1	-3/+1	-1/-1	-2/-1	-6		-4/-7

	The  values  after  the  slash under passive signature are with the
black globe 100% on.  The battleship gains no advantage from flickering the
black globe at 10%.
	The  battleship  has  a  number  of  tactical options.  When silent
running,  it  switches on the black globe fully which makes it very hard to
detect,  scan  and  get fire control locks on.  When not silent running and
not  using  G  turns, it may usefully use its active sensors out to range 2
(-2  Diff  mods), without a noticeable increase in signature.  This mode is
typically  used  while conducting boarding actions and orbital bombardment.
If  the ship starts to use G turns, it may increase its active sensor usage
to range 8, without any increase in signature, above the exhaust signature.




Detection

	The  quality  of  detection  can  be  broken  up  into four levels,
candidate detection, target detection, target scan and fire solution.  Each
progressively  provides  more  information  about the target.  The target\'s
signature and range generally determines the level of information provided.
Candidate  detection  indicates  something  is  out  there.   The target is
minimally detectable, but there is not necessarily sufficient data to build
up  any further information.  Candidate detection is primary in determining
the  initial range of the encounter.  A ship detects the target at a number
of  light  seconds  equal  to the sensor short range, halved or doubled for
each  +/-  signature  diff mod.  In Brilliant Lances, use a range of sensor
extreme  range  +  2D6 hexes, halved or doubled for each +/- signature diff
mod.   Use  the passive signature if the target is not changing its vector,
or  the  exhaust  signature if the target is conducting in-system transfer.
Include the -3 diff mod for exhaust signature if the target is accelerating
away  from  or  decelerating  towards the sensing ship.  If one side in the
encounter  detects  the  other  first,  it may attempt surprise.  Candidate
detection  also  determines the minimum range at which a ship with equal or
greater  acceleration  can successfully escape the other, provided that the
ships are on an opening vector.  Use the exhaust signature including the -3
diff  mod,  to  determine  the escape range.  Escape range is 0 if the ship
jumps.
	Target  detection  occurs  during the Sensing Phase of ship combat.
On  a  successful  target detection, reveal displacement, maneovour Gs used
this  turn,  heading  and  velocity  of the target ship.  On an outstanding
success  against  the  target\'s  passive  signature, the sensing player may
examine  the  specifications  of  the enemy ship if it is known to them, or
general  type  and  relevent  capabilities (ie tech level, maneovour drive,
powerplant,   ECCM,   configuration,  weapons  and  sensors  already  used)
otherwise.   Target scan may be attempted immediately upon target detection
and allows the sensing player to use any and all available sensors with the
handoff  advantage  against  the  target  passive  signature  to attempt to
achieve  the  above outstanding success result.  If active sensors are used
by  the  sensing  ship  and  they  had not previously gone active, they are
treated  as  having  gone  active  by  the target only.  If this causes the
active  signature  of  the sensing ship to be higher than the signature the
target used, it may attempt to redetect the sensing player.
	Fire  solutions  occur during the fire phase and represent attempts
to  generate  a  fire control solution against the target using master fire
directors  and  beam  pointers.  Although a ship may have been detected and
scanned,  this  will  not  necessarily have provided sufficient heading and
velocity  information for beam weapon hits.  The fire solution and the beam
weapon  hit  are  not divided further because the fire solution implies the
beam  weapon  hit except where absolute range causes significant delays (of
tenths  of  a  second  or  more)  between determination of the fire control
solution and the beam generated hitting the target.


The Detection Task

	The  detection task should be determined from the range between the
target  and the sensing player, based on the short range of the sensor.  If
the  target  is  beyond  maximum  range or within sensor short range, apply
+diff  mods  as  doubling  of effective range, and -diff mods as halving of
effective range.
	Use  the  detection  difficulty unless the target had been detected
the  previous  turn,  or  the  sensor lock is being handed off from another
sensor  or  the  target  has  not maneovoured since being last detected, in
which case use the hand off difficulty.

		Detection	Hand Off
	Range	Difficulty	Difficulty
	Short	Average		Easy
	Medium	Difficult	Average
	Long	Formidable	Difficult
	Extreme	Impossible	Formidable

	Apply  the appropriate signature diff mod based on the sensors used
and the target disposition.  Use the easiest signature to detect.
	Interference  occurs  from a number of sources.  Add up the sources
of  interference  and  apply  as  a  positive  difficulty  modifier  to the
detection  task.   Candidate  detection  is  unaffected by any interference
except from planets, asteroids and the sun.
	If  line  of sight passes through a hex with a white out counter in
it.
	If  line of sight passes through the movement of another ship which
expends G turns.
	If the target moved through a hex with a planet or asteroid.
	If the target popped enough decoys.
	If the target moved across the heading (1-12) which the sun lies on
(Determine or roll randomly at the start of the scenario).
	If the target made a successful evasion attempt (+2 Diff mods if an
Outstanding Success).

	Ladar only
	If the target has sand up or elects to expend a cannister.

	Radar and Active EMS only
	If  a  successful jamming attempt was made against the sensor.  (+2
Diff mods if an Outstanding Success)
	If line of sight passes through an Area Jamming area of effect.


	Candidate  detection  is  automatic  if  the  final  sensor task is
Impossible or better.

	Target  scan  difficulty  uses  the hand off difficulty against the
targets passive signature.

	Fire  solution  is  the higher difficulty of a detection based on a
target scan and the difficulty based on the absolute range of the weapon or
master  fire  director (Whichever is less).  Fire solution is also modified
by the target size, evasion and absolute range diff mods, which are reduced
by  master fire director diff mods and weapon overpowering.  Also apply one
of the following diff mods.

	Target expended no G turns		-1 Diff mod
	Target cannot maneovour			The fire solution task
						is always Easy.

	If  the  target  has  expended no G turns but has been detected, it
must  expend  G  turns  the  following turn to avoid being treated as if it
cannot  maneovour.   This  expenditure  of  G  turns  represents  immediate
response  to  a successful detection of the target, through changing vector
or heading or evading to render the course of the ship unpredictable again.


Division of Responsibility

	In  combat,  the target player determines the target signature, and
announces  the  tech  level  of  the  active  signature  if using an active
signature.   The  sensing  player  determines base difficulty and all other
diff  mods.   The target player must provide the necessary information on a
success or outstanding success on the detection task.

Opinions are welcome.

 A while ago, I saw a article in White Wolf<?> about so called \'Black 
Worlds\'.

 Ala, secerate worlds cordoned off by the Imperial Intelligance agency<s>
 They had alien races with special abilities ect.
 Could someone type up that article(if that would be copyright 
acceptiable or whatnot) or tell me where to get a copy. I looked in a 
White Wolf issue and didn\'t see any place where I could order back issues.

I have a query on space combat:   I cannot find any rules in TNE main rule
book
that explain anything about starship detection.  Is this covered anywhere or
have I just missed it?   Is it covered in Brillant Lances in detail? 

I recall reading something in starship combat about the range at which you
are
detected being dependent on whether you are using passive or active sensors -
all of which makes perfect sense, but cannot find anything about what 
information is available via standard sensors (e.g. Ship Type, maybe its 
ID-number, its registration starport etc).

I have just started running my first campaign under TNE rules and my players
(all of whom have no Traveller experience at all) keep asking questions about
"What do we know about this ship ?"  So, I have to make up sensor-ops tasks
for
them to decide what they can find out.

What I really want to know is, are there any rules/guidelines for it?

Thanks,

Pete Blake.

I think I saw a 50ton fighter done on here before, if not, I\'ll make one in
FFS
and convert it (it\'s small enough to bother with a BL design).


NOTE: any PEMS listed as P:X(Y) have a nonfolding array with short range X,
and
      a folding array of short range Y.

      All these have 50 gturns fuel in addition to jump fuel (94 with)----the
      intentional slop in the designs could increase the fuel by up to 15
gturns
      depending on the ship, and how tight a design you want.  Crew quarters
      assume HAIS (closer to old High Guard stuff), but I added *a lot* of
slop
      to crew areas (6% of hull, vs. 2.5% for MT designs).

      Also, the L(-5)10:0 anti-missile lasers only have 2 MFDs per battery 
      (there are 3 batteries of 2000 on this ship)--they use overfiring
instead.

Think about a fully independant missile, with a tiny (short range 30,000km or
less) PEMS... the AEMS on that BB is looking like an attractive target :)

Ah, excellent, the ARM is on the prowl.

First things first - Vampire Fleets is great!!!

I was waiting to see when and how the friendly virus would be introduced
into the universe, and VF did it well.

Few questions though:

1) On page 15, the referee\'s notes on Aight say it has an operational
starport, whilst the subsector map and UPP on page 14 says class X, which
I take as no starport. The same applies to Matunuck on the map, but it has
an E class starport on the UPP.
Ihishi, 3204 on the map on p14 has no starport, on the UPP on the same page
is is given as having a D class starport.
On page 19 the referee\'s notes on Exeter says the world has no operational
starport, and then says in the next paragraph that Romrugo of Vars, the 
most powerful of the TEDs controls the starport and a fleet of 3 armed 
spacecraft. Does Exeter have a starport?

2) The Star City surface map had a symbol in the Map Key for Compute HQ (
....er ignore the last line, just figured out that Compute HQ (and tube
station) referred to the members of the sentient council, and not one of
them.
What is the Large Hex superimposed over several hexes in the Downport region?

3) Are we going to get a Covenant of Suffren sourcebook? I was dissapointed
that Vampire Fleets didn\'t have more info on it. The article on the Covenant
in Challenge 76 blew me away!

Thats all, roll on Keepers of the Flame!

Hi,

I was reconsidering fusion rockets (and trying to characterize the exact 
differences between them and HEPlaR (since we know HEPlaR is just a fusion
rocket given the energy of the exhaust vs. energy in)...

Drive type      TL		Thrust		FC    		%disp./gturn
----      --		----		---- 		----

Fusion Rkt      9		9		.00035		.1775

HEPlaR          10		200		.00088		.4464


The fusion rocket is 2.5143 times more efficient in fuel use, but the drives
are huge (around 8% of disp. per g).  I was thinking of adding an "extra
dirty"
HEPlaR that would look like this:

Drive type      TL		Thrust		FC        	 %disp./gturn
----      --		----		----    	 ----

Dirty HEPlaR    12 		 200		.00035		.1775


It just gives a traditional HEPlaR the FC of the fusion rocket.  I picked
TL12
since that\'s when damper technology (and hence strong/weak manipulation)
comes
into play.  The point was to get a few more gturns for ships that don\'t have
to
land on populated planets.

On a practical level (converting designs) it allows you to simply multiply
the
number of gturns of fuel by 2.51----which would give military ships that are
tight designs with just 50gturns, 125 gturns to play with.

I like this \'cause we wanted ships to be a little closer to CT, and I can
still
design FFS ships, and have a note at the bottom that says "if you want a more
CT feel, treat the exhaust as you would a fusion rocket, and multiply all
gturns
of fuel by 2.51 (unless you are running the drive "clean"----more inert 
propellant, less direct fusion)".

What do you think?

-Merrick

    'body' => '        I am not sure what the official rules for the design of flame
throwers would look like (if there is one), but i use the following
guidelines:

1.      flamethrowers do not do any sort of impact or penetrative damage.  
        there are essentialy two types of streams which could be used in
these devices: thickened and unthickened napalm or similar fuel compound.
the unthickened version acts like a giant bic lighter on its side.  this
version is used for suppression and harassment of enemy troops and will
ignite exposed flamibles.  i assign a damage of 2D on contact with
unprotected skin surfaces, and 1d per second of contact durring the attack;
and 1D for protections of rigid armor.  (allow 1 turn per armor level for
the reduced heat damage levels.)  if the target is ignited, the rules say 1D
per second (p286 TNE)
        the thickened fuel version throws a thick flaming liquid at the
target, and covers it on contact.  this version has a longer range but uses
much more fuel per attack.  i assign 2D on contact plus the customary 1D per
second for as long as the target is covered with the flamable liquid.  the
same penetration rules apply.
2.      flamethrowers are deadly to the users.
in world war II the highest casulaties were in the ranks of those who used
the flamethrowers.  this is for several reasons:
        the weapon has miserable range
        there is a huge fuel tank straped to your back waiting to explode or
burn when it gets shot
        the enemy tends to hate geting hot under the collar against his/her
will.  the psychological effects of this dictate that they will concentrate
fire on the operator.
3.      flamethrowers are psychologicaly devisataing on troops.  apply the
appropriate morale factors.

i hope this helps.

TL10 & TL11 100ton Scout/Courier

TL10 was when the soon-to-be ubiquitous Imperial Scout/Courier was
first developed. Now the most common ship in Regency Space, the
TL10 Model is still being produced on smaller worlds and in Jump1
Clusters for light duty and long lasting service.

Early variations of the Scout/Courier were made for exploration
that included removing the cargo hold to expand the fuel tankage,
allowing for 4 consecutive Jump-1\'s and still allow 25.6 G-Turns
for manuever.

The TL11 Model was the first to commercially integrate the Jump2
Technology with it\'s reduced fuel usage, and some upgraded
electronics.

Again the extended range variation of the Scout/Courier was made for
exploration. Removing the cargo hold to expand the fuel tankage
allowed for 2 consecutive Jump-2\'s and 48 G-Turns for manuever.

  1.) How does one figure out what the volume of a robot\'s arm should be?

  2.) Why are there no rules for creating human-looking robots such as the
  one featured in the adventures in Traveller Digest? (And, presumably, the
  ones Strephon used as stand-ins).

  3.) Could we see a detailed example of the construction of one of the \'bots
  in the back of the book? Examples can help illustrate things which rules
are
  sometimes unclear on.

    Thanks!

I couldn\'t find a specific reference here - however the chassis

These rules are also in Book 8...  I would be more than happy to repost them
here however they are copyright material even though they are two
generations old (Original Traveller).  I\'ld like to know GDW\'s view on
this...  Personally I doubt they\'re gonna lose any sales over me posting it
but not my place to say :)

We need more of this IN GENERAL - the computer rules current as of
MegaTraveller for starship design have thrown me completely for a loop...
I\'ld love to see how people figure out control panels etc

I don\'t know where the official archives are, but I have a COMPLETE copy of
the archived version.   Where would you like me to send it?

I also have Mark Cook\'s X subsector viewer, whose code I hacked up to make my
DOS subsector viewer (Unfortunately, I lost the
source for the DOS version).  I also have a preliminary version of
an OS/2 subsector viewer, based on Mark\'s X viewer.   I\'m also
considering tackling an X-based sector viewer, and a generic
"everything within n parsecs" viewer, for those of you that don\'t
use the Imperial  sector grid system for marking out space...

P.S. To whomever was surveying the TML about our computers,
well, Steve is using the OS/2 box, and I recently started using
LINUX.  I have discovered THE cure for OS/2 fanaticism: Load
Linux!  Now, what\'s the cure for Linux fanaticism?  (Anyone 
who suggests Windows 95 will be shot...)

Yes.  The book is quite good.  My only dislike with it is the Fer De 
Lance Anti-Virus weapon picture.  This one is really bad.  What do you think?

Well, this information can be found under Step: 6 Peripherals (p. 74).  
In short, you choose the volume of the arm and the precentage devoted for 
articulation and for power.  The next step will lead you to the agility 
of the arm and so forth.

Look again.  Under suspension, you can find Leg, under transmission, you 
can use Walker ans so forth.  Mental characteristics can be found later 
on.  Eyes, brain, sensors, arms, hit location rules are all there.  All the 
parts that are needed to design a humaniod robot are there.  Try it.

That would be nice.  But if you own and use FF&S, the robots design rules 
follow the same concepts as vehicle and lift vehicles design.  Take a 
look at that and try some simple designs.  Good luck.

     Some of you may recall and/or have access to the Solomani and Aslan 
     (Rats and Cats) book.  In the Solomani section, there is a ship design 
     for a Fleet Courier.  I converted the Fleet Courier to TNE stats (I\'ll 
     supply the unmodified stats at a later date).  Below is a modified 
     version of the Marathon-Class Fleet Courier for use in the new era.  
     For my own Terran Pocket Empire campaign, the idea is that only the 
     TL-14 bonded superdense hull was salvaged.  The remainder of the 
     equipment is TL-12 (the technology level to which Terra has recovered 
     in my campaign). 
     
     The fledgling Terran Navy uses this modified Fleet Courier for a 
     number of operations detailed below.  I thought you might all enjoy 
     this blast from the past MegaTraveller/TNE conversion, though.  Have

     Notes
     
     The Marathon-Class Solomani Fleet Courier was originally designed to 
     carry orders and news between task forces and their headquarters.
     
     In the post-collapse era, the Terran Protectorate, one of many pocket 
     empires scattered across the wilds, has modified the Fleet Courier for 
     operation in the dangerous outbacks of space.  Using recovered bonded 
     superdense hulls, patched sporadically with molded superdense patches, 
     the modified Marathon-Class makes the best out of recovered relic 
     technology.
     
     While the Terran Protectorate is unable to sustain the class\' original 
     TL-14 technology, the Marathon-Class has been refitted with TL-12 
     weapons technology fit to fight off small vampire ships and corsairs.  
     In addition, its enhanced armor makes the modified Marathon-Class a 
     hardy opponent in battle.
     
     A 20-ton gig is attached by an external grapple to the ship\'s ventral 
     surface.  The gig is primarily used for port-of-call stops and courier 
     missions to larger fleet starships that admit ship\'s boats in enclosed 
     landing bays.

     The Ilium-Class Solomani Gig was designed for use with the 
     Marathon-Class Fleet Courier, but is often seen attached to other 
     small warships, including Solomani close escort and patrol cruiser 
     variants.
     The Ilium is designed for maximum speed and comfort.  It is used to 
     transfer flag-rank naval officers between starships and as an 
     emergency vehicle for its parent-ship crew.

You could mail it to me here, but it would be better, probably, to 
put it at MPGN\'s ftp site, or at ghost...

I spent some time this weekend playing with another program I found, 
sub2ps, which also makes nice postscript subsector maps.  It uses a 
different file structure that what\'s in the sector files at ghost, 
but I\'ve got a small Basic program that re-arranges the data 
correctly and breaks the sectors into sub-sector.  It also puts in 
the Sector name, Subsector letter, and the neighboring subsectors on 
each of the four sides.  When I figure out the algorithm, it\'ll have 
the proper subsector letters on the sides, too, so we can make a nice 
complete atlas. 

I\'m also in the midst of doing another program that \'Collapses\' the 
sectors, a la the rules in TNE pp 190-91.  When I get them finished, 
I\'ll put them at one or another of the ftp sites, and announce it to 
the lists.

	The cure, I think, is pretty drastic...death and/or cold turkey from

I\'m too lazy to drag in, format, and copy all the stuff to the 20 or

complete setting it up.

  Frankly, GURPS Robots is MUCH easier to work with, as their batteries are
rated in kilowatt hours (1 KW-h = 3,600 KW stored). This does not bode well.
The table in FF&S refers to output discharge per hour (for TL-12 this is 1.5
MW). There are also rules for lower and higher discharge rates. As stated,
the
robot requires 0.35 MW, but is this per hour? If so, then a 35 MW storage

     technology.
     
     While the Terran Protectorate is unable to sustain the class\' original 
     TL-14 technology, the Marathon-Class has been refitted with TL-12 
     weapons technology fit to fight off small vampire ships and corsairs.  
     In addition, its enhanced armor makes the modified Marathon-Class a 
     hardy opponent in battle.
     
     A 20-ton gig is attachd by an external grapple to the ship\'s ventral 
     surface.  The gig is primarily used for port-of-call stops and courier 
     missions to larger fleet starships that admit ship\'s boats in enclosed 
     landing bays.

 Yes, the picture is pretty sad.
 But the art in the book is better then most of the art(breeds rule ;) )
 Seeing as how they have rules for it now, anyone wanna work on making a 
full cyborg?
 Ala robot but with Human brain and the life support systems for it. I 
think it would make a wonderful addition to T:NE.
 It would have to be a special character class tho, because othersie 
they\'res no way a character(unless they\'re REALLY old) could afford to 
become one.
 But I think full cyborgs would be very popular. av50 walking tank 
carrying a Crunch Gun and he would cost a fraction of what a comparable 
combat abilitie would cost from Robots, Vehicles, Or highley trained 
humans(in the long run only), and he could eat food instead of 
electricity(small fusion reactor or fuel cell) simplifing supply.
 The bonus would be you\'d be getting a _much_ smarter combat unit, with 
the abilitie to adapt(if you don\'t wanna use a virus robot) and you 
woulden\'t have to pay for the robot brain. Wich is _expensive_ and 
_extreemley_ hard to produce. Hence it would be better at lower tech levels.
just a thought.... I would like one.... Maybe Loren could 
contribuite(always wanted to work for GDW ;) )

    'body' => '	FFS Helicopter Design

	A while ago I wrote about the difficulties of re-crating modern
	helicopters with FFS design rules. Because the rules would not
	work correctly, I did some literature research about real-life
	helicopter design, and found the mathematical model of power
	consumption in hovering and flight.

	Complete helicopter model is very complex, and while it gives
	quite accurate power consumption values for various airspeed,
	weight, and drag combinations, it is too massive to be used
	with FFS design rules. However, the model can be used to
	pinpoint some errors in FFS.


	Design Strategy

	Helicopters can be designed using either aircraft of lift
	vehicle rules. Both rules give quite similar end results, but
	lift vehicles can be designed with armor.
	Note that page 22: Lift Vehicle Chassis Configuration table and
	page 30 Airframe table have similar values (only examined from
	different perspectives) and all Airframes can be used as Lift
	Vehicle Chassis.

	Airframes not listed in Lift Vehicle Chassis table
	Type		Volume	SA	Price	Min	Max	Eff
	Autogyro	0.005	70	1.02	40	200	0.65
	Wing-in-Ground	0.05	70	1.02	75	400	0.90

	(These airframes are not suitable for helicopters, but I use
	these values when I design PARWIG vehicles.)


	Rotors

	FFS, page 32: Rotor Assemblies lift values are too low. I could
	model only MTR and NOTAR rotors, and lift values for other
	rotor types can only be estimated.

	Type	Lift (ton/MW)
	MTR	8
	NOTAR	8.4
	TMR	10 ?
	CMR	10 ?
	X-Wing	10 ?

	I could not find enough data to check the actual weights of
	different rotor assemblies, so I use the values from the Rotor
	Assemblies table, but substituting:

	Wt: Weight in tons, per _MW output_ of power plant.
	Volume in m3 is equal to the weight of rotor. (This is the 
	actual volume of the rotor assembly. Note that parked 
	helicopter may still take large amount of hangar space, because 
	the rotor blades can be quite long.)

	Power Plants

	Power plant can be either Improved Internal Combustion Engine
	(piston engine) or Gas Turbine. Almost all modern helicopters
	use gas turbines ("turboshaft"), and piston engines are mainly
	used in radio controlled drones.
	One possible helicopter power plant is rotor tip-drive, that 
	means tip-mounted pulsejets (AZHRAE) or ramjets. Pulsejets are 
	used mainly in target-drones, and ramjets are used in TJ-5 and
	NHI Kolibrie helicopters. I am still unable to find enough 
	design data for rotor tip-drive engines.

	FFS, page 63: Chemical Power Plants table shows quite poor
	values for gas turbines. The following values are taken from
	Pratt & Whitney PT6 -series turboprops and turboshafts, and the
	values are for the whole engine installation (including gas
	generator, free power turbine, reduction gearbox and drive
	shaft).

	TL	MW	Mass	kl/hour	Name
	6	1.9	0.5	0.39	PT6A-6
	7	3.4	0.7	0.345	PT6A-42
	8	4.9	0.9	0.3	PT6A-68
	9	6.4	1.1	0.255	Estimated future model
	10	7.9	1.3	0.21	Estimated future model

	Note: values are for 1 cubic meter of engine. Original engine
	volumes (Min Vol ?) were about 0.22 m3. TL 8+ values are
	estimates based on PT6 technical evolution curves.

	Gas turbine is more suitable helicopter power plant than MHD
	generator, because gas turbine produces mechanical energy and
	MHD generator produces electrical energy.
	Magnetohydrodynamic generation of power is based on the direct
	conversion of fuel energy into electrical energy by flowing a
	heated, electrical conductive fluid or gas through a magnetic
	field. To achieve this, fuel is often doped with impurities, so
	that exhaust gas is electrically conductive, and this exhaust
	gas is piped through magnetic field. The impurities in fuel
	often make the exhaust gas highly toxic.
	Note: the MHD _turbine_ described in text in page 63 is
	completely unknown to me. As far as I know, the modern MHD
	power generators are not based on turbine technology.

I haven\'t seen Vampire Fleets over here in the UK yet (has anyone?). However 
your question was about storage batteries. What you need to understand is
that 
the megawatt is a measure of power delivered per second. This means that a
50Mw 
power supply will deliver 50,000,000 joules of energy per second for as long
as 
it continues to operate, and systems requiring 50Mw of power need 50,000,000 
joules of power per second (wow! enough to boil 120 litres of water per
second, 
TNE kettles must be incredible), supplied by the 50Mw power plant. With 
batteries, the output listed is in Mw-hours. At TL12 a 1kl battery can
sustain a 
1.5Mw output for 1 hour.
In FFS you need to choose first a power supply which gives the desired
output, 
and then either add fuel, or change the battery size until the desired output
is 
reached. For a 100 hour duration battery, the output is multiplied by 0.02,
so a 
battery with a 1-hour discharge power of 17.5Mw needs to be chosen (not 35Mw,

as slow discharging batteries are more efficient). Unfortunately at TL12,
this 
has a volume of  11.66kl. Fuel cells would be more useful, at 0.46kl for the 
power plant, and 0.0875kl fuel per hour (around 9.2kl for the whole power 
plant). The only way to completely satisfy the 0.25kl requirement would be to

use TL15 fusion, with a 0.1kl power plant, and 0.0007kl fuel for 100hour 
duration, or 0.06kl for a year.

Although you may find GURPS easier, it seems to have confused you. Kilowatt 
hours are quite different to kilowatts. 1 kilowatt hour describes a battery 
which can produce 1 kilowatt for an hour, or 2 kilowatts for half an hour,
etc. 
Kilowatt hours are a measure of energy (1kWh = 3.6Mj of energy), kilowatts
are a 
measure of power.
Energy(kWh)/required power(kW)=duration(h)

I hope something here helps.

Having figured it out in Kilowatts, you have the power (power is energy per
unit time) -- 1 kilowatt is 1 kilojoule per second.  I don\'t have vampire
fleets, but assuming the tables are the same as for FF&S:

1000 hours * .35 KW = 1 hour * 350 Kw = 1 hour * .35 MW. = .35 MW-Hours

The table on FF&S page 66 is in MW per cubic meter for a battery which will
discharge in one hour, so we need a battery of .35 MW-Hours (1260 MJ)

So, assuming tech 12, that row of the table reads: MW-1.5 Mass-2 MCr-.005.

since we want .35 MW / 1.5 MW = .23 of that battery

.23 * 1 m^3 = .23 m^3
.23 * 2 tonnes = .46 tonnes = 460 Kg
.23 * .005 MCr = .00115 MCr = 1,150 Cr

(Altough I stand ready to be corrected)

No, thats 3600 KW-Hours stored.  Its 3600 KW released for 1 hour.  Actually,
the FF&S batteries are also rated in KW-Hours (well MW-Hours, really) --
they have just chosen an odd way to express it.

Sorry, I read that as 1000 hours, so the battery I specced is 10 times too
large/expensive etc.  Still fits in the .25 m^3 you have available, though.

produced two responses: "Well, in Book 8: Robots it says..." and "Just read
the book." It appears either that not enough people know what I\'m talking
about OR I wasn\'t clear enough about my specific difficulty.So here goes:
   Quoting VAMPIRE SHIPS, page 74, second column, 7th paragraph;
   "The agility if the arm is the percentage of [the arm] devoted to
articulation divided by 10..." No problem here; if the percentage of the
arm devoted to articulation is 40%, the AGL is 4.
   Next paragraph:
   " The strength of the arm is the total volume in liters devoted to power.
When determining the STR attribute of the robot, round this value to the
nearest whole number (but never less than 1)."
     I may answer my own question here, but let\'s say your robot has an arm
whose total volume is 0.25 kiloliters or 250 liters. 40% of the arm is
devoted to articulation (or 100 liters). This leaves 150 devoted to STR.
Is this the robot\'s STR, 150? Or is this supposed to be dvided by 10, thus
giving our robot a STR of 15? Or is it based on the percentage devoted to
STR, giving our robot a STR of 6? I beleive the STR would be 15. Thus, I
think something has been left out.

You\'re confusing power with energy storage...

The POWER used is 0.35 MW (I\'m assuing your initial KW was mistyped).
The endurance is 100 hours; look on Fire, Fusion, and Steel (it also
may be in Vampire Fleets) at the battery table and the battery endurance
table just below it.  I believe the output multiplier for 100 hr
discharges is 0.01; so the battery\'s basic 1-hr output capability
would be 0.35 / 0.01 or 35 mw for one hour.  The output discharge
per (I believe it\'s liter of battery) of 1.5 means that you have
35 / 1.5 or 23.333 liters of battery.  Check whether that\'s per kl
or per liter, though.

And doublecheck whether it\'s 0.35 KW or 0.35 MW of power needed...
makes some difference ;-)

					Dr. Laskey - RCES field surgery

Some bootstrap missions encounter problems with native mistrust, and small 
groups of Coalition personnel may find themselves trapped by crowds of
natives. 
Use of standard ammunition and resulting civilian casualties are clearly 
unacceptable, and there are occasions when use of knockout gas is
inappropriate, 
because a fast response is needed (where there is no time to put on gas
masks), 
or because only some of the people in an area need to be subdued. With this 
problem in mind, the RCES produced the Crowd Suppression Weapon and Light
Crowd 
Suppression Weapon.
These gauss weapons shoot an extremely small caliber round (1.94mm*9.7mm) at 
high velocities. These weapons have very significant advantages over standard

arms firing Tranq rounds. The magazine sizes are much larger than a standard 
gauss weapon would allow, and recoil is much lower, allowing personnel a much

higher controllable rate of fire. The weapon is produced in two
configurations, 
a pistol for general and covert useage, and an SMG configuration for security

personnel. The weapon is manufactured at TL12, with the exception of the TL13

barrel, which is purchased from the Hivers.

You have it exactly right.  Of you look at Book 8: Robots, you will find that
100 kl=a standard humanoform robot.  Arms are 10 kl each, which would give
general stats of say, agility 5 (50% devoted to agility) and strength 5 (5 kl
remaining).  The one thing that the Vampire Ship Robot rules do is create 
**HUGE** robots - and it is not unbelievable that huge robots would be
very strong.  

Also: with regards to humanoid robots that look like a human - I would follow
the pattern in the cypebernetics section of FF&S, where "slick" versions
of the main body components are available by TL12.  Take the 1 TL advantage
that all of the Cybernetics components have when applied to robots, and I
would
say you could build a human-looking robot at TL11.  The components would all 
cost the full FF&S price (no discount for higher TL than introduction level)
and would only be moderately capable of fooling another human - that would
depend
on the final TL of the robot, and the sophistocation of the brain.  If you
think
this is not enough of a cost penalty, you could assign a blanket price mod
for all robotic (non-slick) components, such as the chassis and the
arms/legs,
anywhere from x2 to x10 might be appropriate.

I have to say, I think that the Vampire Ship design rules are about the 
clearest rules that GDW has come up with in a while - the only major
departure
from FF&S is the robot brain, and that is the easiest part to understand
(unlike
book 8).  The only challenge is producing the small robots that (IMHO) would
be the most common.

My one major question though is about the Pattern Recognition and Voice
Recognition Skills.  Does a robot have to have these to see and hear, 
respectively?  It seems like these would be part of the basic eye/ear 
hardware, but it\'s not clear.  Also..why would a neural(data) jack be 
so expensive for a robot?  I would think that it would be about as costly 
and rare and add on for a robot as a serial port is on a pc.

Very popular with army generals, probably less fun for the guy trying to have
a 
normal social life with an anti armour rifle built into his shoulder. Perhaps

you could use an interchangeable brain case, so that when the cyborg was off 
duty he could \'wear\' a more anthropomorphic body.

Food could supply the small amount of nutrients needed, but maybe you could 
extract enough hydrogen from the food as well, to power a fusion plant (sorry
if 
thats what you meant). Cyborg troops might need deuterium enriched food, in 
which case it would be easier to fuel them normally, but if they had some 
inbuilt fuel purification, then they could live off the land in longer
military 
campaigns.

Is this in the Vampire Fleets rules? Brain transplants and full neural 
interfacing sounds fairly difficult and expensive. There could be some 
interesting moral issues with this. If a soldier gets shot up badly, do you 
even try to regenerate his body, or just put the brain in a new body, 
incidentally providing a much better soldier for your army. Some cyborg 
characters could have quite chip on their shoulder, if this happened to them 
withou their permission.

Just a quick question...

I was looking at spinal and parallel MG and PAW mounts in FFS, and it got me 
thinking.  How many targets can a ship deal with with its spinal and parallel
(or radial in a spherical hull) mounts since they would have only a limited
pointing ability (outside of moving the whole ship)?

I always assumed that bays were just *big* turrets (as they were in AHL), but
they don\'t include enough room for pointing bay sized PAWs/MGs, and even if
they did, the surface area should be more like length*dia. than Pi*r^2.  If
bays
made a little more sense, and you could only point fixed mounts at so many 
targets, you\'d have a reason to make bay weapons----which aside from missiles
and super lasers have no usefulness (bogan-bays as well, vs. smaller ships).

The easiest thing would be to standardize the socket size for each bay (dia.
+
some depth) that doesn\'t use the whole volume, and allow the weapon to sit
"above decks" as a naval turret would these days.  As for number of targets
to be engaged, I was thinking of something like this:

1.A ship can engage a number of targets with spinal and parallel mounts equal
to
the number of gturns *not* spent (out of its max g) on maneuver or evasion
with
the following modifiers.

	a. -1 target for each rate of fire DiffMod above -1 (high ROFs would
	require the *ship* to point at a given target for a longer period of
	time).

	b. +1 target for each gturn spent on "tracking" targets (the ship uses
	gturns to rapidly move the ship from target to target (if the targets
	are through more than 1 hexside, then all passive detection attempts get
	a -1 DM (it\'s spinning around a lot)).

2.Bay weapons have no such restrictions if they are trainable (for simplicity
I
would just say "bays are trainable", but why not say "my 100m PAW parallel
mount
is really a big bay"?).

Maybe a weapon can\'t be trainable unless it is less than some arbitrary % of
ship displacement (1% of displacement, or 100 tons whichever is higher?).

Any ideas out there?  (it\'d be cool, because it will require ships to
sacrifice
weapon range/performance to be able to deal with multiple targets--making
tactics more important than range 10 big guns if there are enough targets).

I thought the BL/BR rules implied that only one target may be engaged per 
fixed mount and that all such weapons on a particular arc of fire must fire 
at the same target and that only weapons from one arc may fire per turn.
This ignores high ROF weapons firing less shots at each target and hence 
being able to fire at multiple targets at the cost of using the lower ROF 
diff mods.

I envisioned bays as being similar to the casemate mountings used on ships 
from the 1860\'s through to WW1. These have limited traverse compared to 
turrets but are lighter, cheaper and less complex. The Star Destroyers from 
Star Wars seemed to use mountings of this style which is probably where the 
inspiration for bays in Traveller came from.

Just use the BL/BR rules for available facing for a particular maneuver.
The number of targets should be related to the available ROF of the weapon.
Say ROF/(20*number of hexsides covered) targets (fractions rounded to the 
nearest whole number)

 ----
        a. -1 target for each rate of fire DiffMod above -1 (high ROFs would
        require the *ship* to point at a given target for a longer period of

their cost, mass, volume and power consumption. The fact that FFS doesn\'t 
take this into account should be rectified...ideas anyone?

Maybe a weapon can\'t be trainable unless it is less than some arbitrary % of

I don\'t like arbitary anything. If the rules worked properly then people

One target per fixed mount is what I assumed, but the rest I don\'t know.  In
BR you might see the following:

M(-2)10:16-12-10-7	-3
P(x3-2)10:7		TL15	

Now this ship has one spinal mount, and 9 lesser fixed PAWs.  From my read on
the rules it could fire the spinal mount forward, and 3 PAWs through each of
3
hexsides.  As each weapon would have its own MFD it would be considered fully
controlled, and as far as I can tell, each could shoot at a different target
as long as there were only 3 targets through each hexside.

Regardless, though, these are athwartships (radial) mounts in a spherical
hull,
so even if 3 were firing on one target the whole ship would be required for 
a steering mechanism... The rules just aren\'t thought through, I guess.

Yeah, but how much volume for that limited traverse?  (not aimed at you,
aimed
at the #@!$ rules :)

I wasn\'t trying to have a single weapon shoot at multiple targets (sorry if I
wasn\'t clear on that).  My point is that each fixed weapon requires the
*ship*
to point at the weapon\'s target for some small period of time per shot, and
that if you have several weapons (*or* targets) the ship won\'t be able to
point at or with all of them.

I sure agree with the last statement, but at the same time so many rules seem
arbitrary that adding one more wouldn\'t be all that bad :)  It\'d be easier if
the rules for the adding pointing machinery made pointable weapons above 100
tons difficult to use, then there\'d be a *reason* for ships to take the 
"standard" bays they include (yet another example of making a standard that
would never have evolved on its own using their own rules (it\'d be easier if
I
didn\'t have any ideas of what a traveller ship *should* look like, but I\'ve
been playing a long time)

 Yeah, either a full purifier or you could just use water in the fuision

 Yes, a VERY BIG CHIP no doubt.
 As said before, It was purley technicial speculation.
 And as far as brain transplants and the like. If your going to put a 
robotic brain in there; you already have to have the 
sophisiciated(read:costley) data links. Same for a human brain, \'cept 
it\'s a little diffrent. Not a whole lot more costley I would think.
 Now(especialley from any of us who have even tried to program). Imagine 
the development cost of the programming on a Robot brain capable of 
independant action on the level of a human, with a good iniative, 
minimial glitches(yeah riiiiight) and a personality that won\'t rebel or 
go hay-wire more then humans.
 Can you say \'BILLIONS AND BILLION\'..... If your lucky that is. And 
that\'s just the software.
 Now what about the hardware. You know how hard it is to produce a modern 
day CPU. Now imagine a full robot brain. Nearley impossible for most empires.
 Maybe the Coailition and the Domain could pull it off. But after that, 
except for your isolated TL14 worlds with suriving equal tech computer 
facilities. It would be pipe dreams.
 Where as for a human all you need is a neural jack. Yes, still 
complicated, but alot easier.

 Yes, but I was talking about something MUCH more drastic than the FF&S

 And, is it just me. Or do you all have starting characters like that? ;)
 Probabley becuase I also play cyberpunk<ish> games alot.
 I like cyber. I think it adds alot of flavor and edge(mental, in how you 
picture your character) to your character.
 Also fun to role-play some of the negative side-effects(security guards

We were planning on running the Leviathan adventures in the TNE system, and
Lane (ref) had me work on the ship since I\'m GearBoy (tm).  There is a
*major*
problem we ran into... FFS designs lack the fuel to really explore anyplace
without a logistical train.  In the CT design, the ship could jump into a new
system, then drive around and look for new markets, or more importantly (if
you\'re the crew) fuel.  If they don\'t find it, they can jump out using the
extra fuel.  Getting the design to have enough gturns to explore a starsytem
alone won\'t happen (~220 is max assuming the ship is 100% fuel), especially
when you have to carry stores for the crew, as well as cargo.

I toyed with improving the fusion rocket, but didn\'t follow up on it (we got
busy with other stuff).  I have notes on improving the fusion rocket (the
idea
was that if you\'re going to assume HEPlaR in the universe, then a non "clean"
version should be more efficient by some %.  I worked out the efficiency of
the
HEPlaR (using the energy of the exhaust vs. a fusion reaction) and found that
it
was something like 4% (I don\'t have it handy, but that\'s what sticks in my
head
right now).  Even a small increase would improve the duration of thrust by a 
ways (we decided we needed at least 400 gturns on the Leviathan)--HEPlaR can
always be used near planets for safety.

I\'ll try to find my notes on the non mdrive part of the design, though.

A rare posting for me, but here goes...

I have been thinking about the kind of warships the Regency would have in 
service at the moment, and so began to convert The Battle Rider squadrons 
of the old CT Spinward Marches Campaign and MT Fighting Ships to TNE.
However, it seems to me that the battle rider design concept is no 
longer an effective way of making battle ships using FFS. The rules in FFS 
do not give a battle rider the same advantages that they had under High 
Guard or MT.

Battle Riders were designed because they could defeat a traditional 
warship of equal tonnage by not carrying jump drives. However, once the 
cost of the tender was factored in they were actually more expensive 
than traditional ships, but still worked in CT and MT because of two 
main things: 

1: Spinal mounts were of fixed sizes at each TL, and only one per ship 
was allowed. Compared to the power of spinal mounts, other weapons were 
reasonably inneffective, so there was little advantage in building a 
battleship larger than the minimum size which could carry the largest 
spinal mount available with sufficient jump, maneuvre, and agility.

2:Armour was very expensive (at least it was in MT, not so sure about CT).
Hull cost and mass were independent, so that while hulls got relatively 
lighter as displacement increased, they became cheapest (ie lowest MCr 
per ton) at about 50,000T. With the cost of armour being a significant 
percentage of the final cost of the ship (just look at Fighting Ships!), 
economising in this area was important.

As a result, there was an important role for battle riders, as they were 
cheap to armour (as they were approx 20,000 - 50,000T in size, and the 
rules favoured a fleet that could field the largest number of spinal mounts.
So while battle riders were expensive when combined with their fraction 
of the carrier compared to traditional battleships, larger battleships 
had less and less payoff as their size increased. Once your ship was 
carrying the largest spinal mount, further increases in size were a waste 
of money, and more exopensive to armour etc.

In TNE however, two vital things have changed:

1:Spinal mounts are not limited in size. You can now build that meson 
gun as large as you like, so a bigger ship can carry a bigger spinal mount.

2:Armour is cheap - hull price is now proportional to mass, and the 
mass/ton ratio drops with larger hulls. So it is relativeley cheaper to 
armour larger hulls, there is no longer an optimum size at 50,000T and in 
any case armour isn\'t a major cost any more.

As a result, the design proceedure always favours larger ships. So the 
excess cost of producing battle riders and their tenders is no longer 
worth it - what is important is not the number of spinal mounts, but the 
power of those spinal mounts.

So under TNE the best fleetes are those with the greatest number of large 
battleships. A large battleship can effectively carry enough armour 
and screens etc that it is invincible against any smaller ship., and can 
carry a spinal mount large enough to defeat the screens of any smaller ship.

So the battleship is back, and the battle rider is dead.A bit of a shame 
IMO.I rather like having smaller ships in fleets - it forces designers to 
be cleverer, rather than in TNE where the winner is the side that can 
produce the biggest ship.

Sorry its gone on so long. Any comments welcome.Thanks for listening...

Well, I don\'t know if TNE covered this, but in Megatraveller\'s Refs 
Companion it says the following:

Channel Capacity:  The total number of lines available to a communicator 
equals the square of the device\'s tech level.  All available lines may be 
used for reception; the number of lines used for transmission is limited 
to the tech level of the device.  Each channel in used (Either 
transmitting or receiving) requires one control panel dedicated for it.

ie: a radio comm, TL 14 has 196 lines received and 14 lines transmitted.

LINES PER CHANNEL:

Type			Receive		Send	R/S
----
Voice Simplex		  1/2*		1/2*	 1
Voice Duplex		   1	         1	 2
Comp. Data/Telemetry	   1		 1	 2
Image (w/voice)		   2		 5	 7
Computer Control	   2		 2	 4

* Can only send or receive but not both at the same time (CB like)

So the above communicator can transmit on 2 image channels (5 lines 
each), 1 computer control channel (2 lines), one computer data (1 line) 
and 1 voice channel (1 line) at the same time.  


Hope that helped,

On the contrary, I think that the light to midsize rider is going
to enjoy a resurgence in popularity rather than a drop in effectiveness.

Combat effectiveness is a complex interplay between offensive firepower,
range, and ability to absorb or deflect incoming hits, with quite a bit
of maneuver and tactics for good measure.  Ignoring maneuver and tactics
for now, let us look at firepower and defenses.

Under TNE/FF&S and in particular the Battle Rider expansion game for
fleet combat, firepower can now be made in all sorts of nifty shapes
and sizes, some of which are totally unlike firepower in previous
versions of the game.  Also, unlike before, armor mass now hurts
your maneuverability... you can get armor-2000 if you want, but it\'s
gonna only make 0.1 G and have a G-turn or two of endurance...

Look for example at lasers.  Previously, lasers were a joe shmoe
baseline weapon which didn\'t do anything spectacular.  Now, due to
the rules changes, lasers punch holes in just about any armor in
existence... missile based lasers can kill a battle ship with enough
hits, through ANY armor (excepting million ton juggernauts with armor
1000 or so...), and large bay and spinal grade lasers can punch holes
in _anything_ out to 80 hexes if designed right.  If anything, ships are
much more vulnerable than they used to be, because very very long range
lasers can kill in ways that used to be impossible even with Meson
spinal mounts.  You can put enough firepower on a TL-10 10,000 ton
monitor to take out anything in the world.  Big ships are just big
targets in that sort of environment.

The Battle Rider rules more or less indicate that ship survivability
has taken a nosedive with the rules rewrite.  Combats will degenerate
into fast bloody mid to long range firefights, where things are detected
well within max weapons range and the side with a firepower advantage
very quickly wins out.  Scouting with smaller ships becomes more
important, if you can engage at 8 light seconds (80 hexes) when the
enemy doesn\'t have a lock on you yet, you win, even if your scout
ships get nuked.

So go ahead, design big juggernauts, by all means.  I love fighting
opponents who are designed in inferior manners, it keeps most of the
hard parts out of the game ;-)

 The destruction radius on one would all but gut the largest of avaible

 Also, you could have \'small ships\' that would be suicide drones carrying

This is perhaps _THE_ major difference between CT/MT and TNE.  The answer
isn\'t to try to design a TNE ship that performs like a CT ship (although if
that\'s what you want, then you simply allow thruster plates into your
campaign).  The standard TNE is a _different game_ than CT/MT - what worked
in those systems and with those background assumptions probably doesn\'t work
in TNE.

In TNE, exploratory starships aren\'t going to move from world to world
within a system to perform a survey - they can\'t: most worlds are "farther"
away, in terms of travel time or fuel expenditure, than jumping outsystem
would be.

A TNE Leviathan would have fuel reserves for two, or preferably three jumps,
and as much maneuver fuel as could reasonably be added without compromising
the rest of the design.  This way, the ship operates from a known fuel
source - jumping into a new system at a likley place for refuelling
operations.

If there _is_ fuel at that location, it becomes the "base" for further
exploation - perhaps using microjumps in-system, or perhaps jumping to
other systems.  In either case, maximum use should be made of sensor drones
and other remote sensing tools.

So I\'ve decided to start on my first two original designs using FF&S.  
Now, they are inspired more by thing that I\'ve seen in other sci-fi
games and books then anything else.

So, I\'m not sure how to go about designing them under Traveller.

First, I want to create a wheel-vehicle.  Think of it as a big wheel
with a seat in the center, and the wheel revolves around the seat.o

Second, I want to create a starship with the following profile:

       ----          ----          ----      ----
       [    ]----[      ]----[    ]     [|        |==
       [    ]----[      ]----[    ]     [|        |==
       ----          ----          ----      ----
                         FRONT                          SIDE

It\'s should be a 300 ton ship (that\'s what I\'m aiming for anyway).  The
sides are the engines and the center of  the ship is the main
crew/cargo area.

So, even if these designs aren\'t the Traveller norm, are they still
doable?  And if so, how would I specify shape and suspension under
FF&S (ie, would this ship be a slab, and what kind of wheeled vehicle
would the wheelcycle be?)

Thanks in advance...

Derek Wildstar sent a message in the last digest about Surveying systems
in TNE, and I thought i\'d get my pennys worth in:

Jump, your large ship in, near a Gas Giant if possible, refuel. Send your
Modular Cutters with a modified survey module with includes fuel scoops
to explore the outer system, thrust the large ship to the inner system (
as long as there is a fuel source there) and survey. When all surveying is 
done, rendezvous with the cutter\'s  in the outer system, refuel at the Gas 
giant again, jump out to the next system on the exploration list.

Brings up a point about the Survey Ship in TNE, it has to use it\'s cutters
to fuel it - so they\'ll spend ages fuelint the ship for a system survey,
and ages fueling up for the jump out. O.k. if you\'ve got time.

Another unrelated point :- Gazelle Escorts, CG for 300tons, i.e. sans tanks.
How does it refuel at a Gas Giant - it would have to drop its tank\'s 
according to the rules - as a streamlined ship needs CG to fuel at a Gas
Giant.
Once it\'s fueled, it\'s very fuel limited, no endurance? Any words of wisdom
from GDW?

Bye.

Hello all,
I\'ve posted this before, but got no replies/insights, so I thought I\'d post
again in case anyone missed it or has joined since.

My questions are regarding energy storage in TNE, referring to FFS.

1) My calculations show that batteries are about one order of magnitude
better at storing energy than homopolar generators. So why not build weapons
etc with batteries to store pulse energy? And if so, how do you reconcile
the charge energy etc? And indeed how fast does a laser discharge that
energy - i.e. what discharge rate battery do you need?

2) If a homopolar generator of the same size etc, can supply one or 500
shots per second to the same weapon (it is usually only the focal
array/whatever that needs to be beefed up), then what is to stop you
chaining more than one weapon onto the same HPG? For instance, rather than
use up all that precious starship volume on huge HPGs, just build one HPG
large enough to power the largest weapon and then feed the rest from that?
Even if that seems a bit too unfair, it is perfectly feasible to mount ten
laser focal arrays firing at 50 shots per turn feeding off a HPG that could
fire 500 times per turn....

It strikes me that:

a) HPGs are far too weedy or batteries are far too good.

b) HPGs should be beefed up just like focal arrays at higher shots per
second etc. A bit of thought to this could make the multiple weapons per HPG
either give you no gain, or give you some gain so as to make \'intelligent\'
sharing of HPGs another bit of tweaking necessary to get the \'best\' design.

c) HPGs are a silly idea anyway :-) I have not calculated just how fast a
HPG disc would need to be spinning in order to store some of the more truly
massive amounts of energy in a rapidly firing high power weapon, but I would
not be surprised if this came out at some stupidly high figure or lead to
such large rotational stress on the mounting to be impractical.

Any thoughts?
Ralph.

     Do any of you nuclear physics experts know if the electromagnetic

     high-tech weaponry that employs electronics?
     
     In my current campaign, there\'s a good chance the PC\'s starship will 
     be attacked and boarded, and I was wondering if an occurrence like the 
     one described above would be viable.  I envisioned an enemy ship 
     firing off a nuclear missile, detonating it near the PC\'s ship for the 
     expressed purpose of disrupting any and all electrical systems and 
     then boarding them.
     
     I have no idea how a nuclear explosion behaves in a vaccuum, however, 
     and would like to make the occurrence as realistic as possible.
     
     The group uses incredibly high-tech weaponry (gravitic rifles), and I

Yes, but armour is a very important factor of ship design, and larger 
ships (with their lower MV/disp ton ratio) can carry more armour and 
maintain their maneuvreability (sp?). I find it qite easy to design fast 
heavily armoured battleships in the 200,000t range.

I should have mentioned that I use the Max of TL*50MW Discharge Energy 
rule for lasers as otherwise there seems to be no reason for arming your 
craft with anything else. As for armour 1000 - I consider that to be a 
minimum for any medium to large warship, and you don\'t have to have enormous 
ships to happily carry armour 2500 or so.

Large(-ish) ships can be armoured well enough to make particle accelerators 
carried on any ship of equivalent size useless, and with the TL*50Mw rule 
then lasers do not become the killers that you make them out to be 
(otherwise it very much changes the flavour of the game IMO)

If anything I would say that ships can be more easily defended than ever. 
A ship can carry enough armour and large enough screens to defend against 
the weaponry of any balanced ship design of equal size. So to beat your 
opponent\'s ship you have to build yours bigger (So that firepower can be 
increased without sacrificing armour, screens, or maneuvre).

The change has come because now firepower can be constantly increased (by 
building ever larger meson guns or whatever) whereas in High Guard it 
could not (eg at TL14 a type T spinal mount was the biggest thing you could 
stick in a ship). With TNE, small ships die very fast as their defences 
are completely overwhelmed by  the huge firepower that larger ships can 
carry.

I actually considered the requirement to build juggernauts a bit a shame, 
as it takes the innovation out of ship design. I don\'t think its a good 
thing, just the best way to design a combat ship in TNE.

Yes, this is a good point. I hadn\'t really thought about the 
logistics or practicality of it all, and this is something that does 
shape the nature of actual real-world (TM) deployed weapons.

No missile requiring contact or near-contact detonation would ever get 
close enough to a well designed warship with sufficient anti-missile 
lasers, unless you fired enough of them to completely overwhelm the enemy\'s
defences (which would rquire you to have local numerical superiority, and 
so your ships would be effective even if they were traditionally armed).

Also, with the size of missiles in TNE, ships which relied on this tactic 
would run out of ammunition fairly quickly, so they would have to run 
away pretty soon.
I see missiles as only having much of a use as sensor drones for large ships.
While they are effective against small ships, they are virtually useless 
against well armoured warships, even with the increased effectiveness 
that Battle Rider gives them.

Is this inspired by "The Magnificent Three" (Japanese cartoon from early

I\'ve always wanted to hear from someone who remembers it, and can explain it

But in the Real World(tm) few and large ships gives little room for 
maneuverability. If a pocket empire builds only large ships it won\'t 
be able to cover all worlds as effective as it wants. Smaller ships 
gives more ships for the same price and cre number. And more 
importantly you can cover a larger area with the fleet.

For any of you that are/were following the debate on Civilisation etc. I just
thought that I\'d recommend a book that I\'m reading at 
the moment, "War and anti-War - making sense of todays global chaos" by Heidi
and Alvin(?) Toffler.(1993)

The title may sound a little heavy but in fact it\'s very readable.  This book
tries to give some insights into the current (rapidly 
changing) state of the world.  It concentrates on conflict; the reasons for
it , the types currently evolving, future permutations 
and ways of creating peace.  Subjects include AirLandBattle, the Internet,
The Gulf War, Bosnia, Third Wave civilisations, New 
weapons developments, intelligence agencies, the UN...etc.

Overall I\'d say that it\'s worth reading, it has several possible ideas for
Traveller games eg the magic marker containing 
embrittlement agents, so that when a line is drawn around a bridge support,
it\'s structural integrity is compromised.  The book 
does come across as being quite enthusiastic about the US military, so you\'d
better not read it if that will repulse you.

Lighter, but less tough and more expensive than TL8 composite laminate, LCC
would appear to be a poor choice for a hull material.  It does have it\'s

12      Advanced Composites        9              11    MCr0.008

Less durable than TL 12 superdense, but lighter and cheaper, advanced
composites are normally used in civillian and commercial structures, where
armour factor is less important than cost.

15      Enhanced Bonded SD        33              15    MCr0.031

Refinments in material technologies allow improvements to be made on

The subject of ongoing research before the collapse, \'collapsed crystalline\'

advances in crystalline carbon materials discovered at TL16.

The ultimate extension of \'conventional\' technologies, this material

18      \'Exotic Alloy I\'          70              13    MCr0.100 (*)

Only one example of this alloy has ever been found, in the form of a wrecked
hulk orbiting the *LOCATION CENSORED* mainworld.  No form of probing or

Tough beyond belief, it\'s wrecked form is a testament to the titanic powers
weildd by the Ancients.  Some scientists speculate that the material is not
native to this universe.

EMP gun \'through\' the antenna. The \'shock\' should kill the players\' comms
and (hopefully) transmit the EMP throughout quite a lot of the ship, without
having to actually penetrate the hull directly. OK, so there would be
limiters on the antenna amps, directional coupling and all that stuff, but a

Sure, why not?  They do now, why should they suddenly stop having that 
ability in the far future?  The limit is amount of bandwidth your particular

Since the FF&S design sequence isn\'t that fine-grained, (they just give you

Looking in a back issue of Challenge (71). The pulse for firing a laser lasts

0.001 seconds. Lets assume a 300Mj Laser. To deliver 300,000,000 J in 0.001s,
a 
power of 300GigaWatts is needed. The smallest possible discharge time for a 
battery is 0.0036seconds. It doesn\'t matter that this is longer than the
laser 
pulse, the same battery could be used to fire several turrets together during

its discharge. To obtain a 300GW output at this discharge rate a battery with
a 
normal power output of 19.2MW is needed. At TL12 this battery would have the 
following statistics
12.8kl, 25.6t, 1.6MCr.
Compared to 3.6 TL12 HPGs :
54kl,108t, 0.54MCr

These figures seem to indicate that batteries are much better, despite being 
marginally more expensive. The major problem with using batteries instead of 
HPGs is in recharging them. There is a limit to how fast you can recharge a 
battery, I think, whereas an HPG can be accelerated as fast as you can supply

power to it. This means for repeated firing of the weapon, an HPG is 
preferrable. (Although a planetbuster meson gun could use a battery - it only

needs to hit once, and it\'s unlikely to miss)
Anyone out there know anything more specific about battery recharging - 
batteries might be more efficient for low rates of fire and/or lower
discharge 
energies.

The ships you can design if you do this are truly awesome, (a 1000t ship with

2000Mj Particle Accelerator and 10x 700Mj laser barbettes ;-)  ). The problem

with this is one of game balance. It is not a completely disimilar problem to

asking why a 50ROF spinal mount can\'t fire 10 shots at 5 different targets
(at 1 
shot every 36 seconds it should give plenty of time to point the mount). The 
reason GDW gave was, in summary, you can\'t, because you miss sometimes. Not
an 
especially satisfying answer, but sensible for letting the game work. A set
of 
guidelines if you want to include this are:

1/Add 5% to the size of the HPG for every additional weapon you want to fire
off 
it, to take into account the additional power conduits/switches you\'ll need.
2/Make sure you use the TL limit on laser discharge.
3/Put the HPG as a separate damage location inside the ship - any damage to
it 
will bring all connected weapons off-line until repaired.
4/Critical damage (not destruction through cumulative hits) to any connected 
weapon will put the whole system offline, by means of a massive power surge
or 
similar.

These guidelines allow you to produce battleships with an exceptional
offensive 
punch, but which are extremely fragile at the same time. This makes the trade

off interesting, and clever design is required to reduce vulnerability as far
as 
possible.

You tell that to the HPGs. They _are_ actually a real world technology, 
according to Challenge 71 they currently manage 4MJ per metric ton. This is
in 
line with the TL8 figure for HPGs. Higher rates of spin would probably become

possible as a magnetic suspension became practical, and don\'t forget, kinetic

energy is determined by mass and velocity, and the really big HPGs have
plenty 
of mass.

Thanks for the interest.  It\'s nice to see that my idea wasn\'t too
stupid.  Actually, the source comes from many places.  I\'ve seen this
vehicle on an episode of GI Joe, on some Japanese Anime, and an old
story in an issue of Heavy Metal.  I\'ve always thought of it as a very
interesting design.

I always wanted to create this vehicle for MegaTraveller, but alas I
never got around to it.  So, here I am playing the SW RPG (hark, is
there really any other sci-fi game other than Traveller? 8), and in
their latest SW Adventure Journal, lo and behold what should appear? 
Yes, it\'s the vehicle of my dreams.  So the creative juices have begun
to flow and I think I\'m going to build it.

In between work and work and stuff and classes I have been giving the
design some thought.  It\'ll need gyro-stabilizers.  The brakes would be
disc-like brakes that stem off from the seat/command center, and it\'s
configuration would probably be a modified motorcycle type...

Does anyone else have any ideas on this?

There isn\'t one.  It was a reasonable limitation that was developed on the
gdw-beta list.  Without it there are no spinal mounts in the TNE universe. Or
any other weapons for that matter (not unless the designer is a complete
idiot).

Yeah, you\'re right, but that\'s the problem :)  a TL15 bay laser including its
own powerplant could be made for less than 300 tons displacement that would
do criticals on anything out to range 44.

Again, the rule was added to preserve the traveller universe (or do you not
use
*any* ships given by gdw (not unreasonable, actually :)  ---- but it makes an 
interesting alternate universe.  On a related note, why don\'t the gdw ships
reflect the realities of their own rules?  Having piss poor meson guns on
those
stupid TL12 clipper things is idiotic using their own rules, they\'d be *much*
better off with a big laser, and a bunch of missiles.  *sigh*

The only reasonable answer is that they thought they made rules which
supported
the idea of PAWs (MGs as a subset) as a step up from lasers----and they
didn\'t.

     From what I\'ve been able to gather from discussions I\'ve had since my

     even our TL-8 spacecraft have electromagnetic shielding to protect

Theoretically, a big enough surge could disrupt even a fiber optic 
computer.  The light signals have to come from standard electronics 
(LED\'s etc.) and these can be dirupted.  However, due to this weak 
link, these parts of the computer are probably well protected against 
surges.

I imagine that it may be posibble to do logic entirly in light (no 
electronics whatso ever, photonics ?) but the supply of photons still 
has to come from somewhere, even if it\'s a constants source (eg 
photon starage device).

The problem is that once you talk about using battleships, BR is the more 
likely game you\'ll use, and the differences won\'t show up at all.  But I do
like
the guidelines...
 
On a semi-related note, since we know that an HPG can supply any weapon at
whatever DE up to a ROF of 800, and MGs can\'t shoot past 100/turn, then a 
given HPG for a MG can supply 8 guns, no problem.  Also, since meson screens
are
so effective that outstanding hits are all that matter, more guns are better 
than one big one so long as the weapon can do around 20+ on an outstanding
success... maybe a bogan-like spinal mount would be the way to go.  You
ripple
fire the things at one target, and get 8 to hit rolls instead of one. As for
being fragile, it isn\'t any more so compared to a single spinal mount with
its
own HPG.

While it\'s true that big ships can have *huge* (I like BR AV:30ish) AVs, the
thing that kills the BRs is that they need to have that damn jump fuel... only
for maneuver, not jump.  The savings in volume from the lack of Jdrive is
moot in this case, since the BRs need the extra delta V to evade, etc. (not
to mention returning to the tender, etc).

Yup, we have that level of photonic technology now.  For simple switching
circuits (and that\'s all you need to construct a computer) you\'re talking
about femtosecond gate delays.  That\'s fast!

I\'m not a nuclear physics expert, but I am a military equipment amateur...

Only if the electronics aren\'t hardened (i.e., non-military).  Since weapon
systems
are, by definition, military equipment, I would expect them to be
EMP-hardened
as a matter of course.  There is a U.S. MilSpec for it, but I couldn\'t tell
you what
it is.

In TNE, hardened or non-hardened seems to be represented by using fiber-optic
computer systems, or not, as the case may be.  Assume the extra size and cost
of "fiber-optic" computers represents EMP-hardening of all types, not just
fiber-
optics.  Note that the effect of a Particle Accelerator attack IS a really
massive
EMP pulse, and that the rules cover their effects on ship\'s systems. (i.e.,
system
resets on non-fib computers and all the other ship systems -- a PA attack or
EMP
pulse can temporarily paralyze a ship).  

Represent your nuke\'s EMP as a low-energy (it\'s more diffuse) PA attack on
the \\
ship. (or a high-energy one if it is a really big nuke.).  I\'ll let someone
else with
a calculator handy suggest exact numbers.

There\'s also an X-ray "shockwave" effect from nukes detonating in vacuum, 
but someone else will have to give you the details on that... Essentially, a
nuke
has a damage radius in space just like it does on the ground....

Yes, although military electronics tend to be radiation-hardened as much
as possible.

Very little blast, EMP as normal.

	According to the rules; any hit by a particle accelerator 
resets all non FB computers.
	But on the same token, you could say it would only have any

It\'s a "house rule" strongly recommended by the members of the GDW-Beta
list, not an official rule.  Without it, there\'s no point in any type
of starship weapon (except possibly missiles) _other_ than lasers.  IMHO,
the _lack_ of some size limit on lasers was a serious error/ommission
on the part of the authors of FF&S (and unfortunately, the laser design
sequences were not available to the GDW-Beta playtest group before the
publication of FF&S, so it appears that this section of the rules were
never playtested prior to official publication).

Any given "spinal" or bay weapon (such as a PA-gun or Meson-gun) can be
replaced by a laser of the same input energy that delivers more damage
to the target at greater ranges, and with a smaller, lighter weapon
that only requires one crewmember to operate it.

Right.  Which means that for "official" tournament play, the best designs
are going to be built around large, long-ranged lasers.  For a campaign
that resembles Traveller (either in the classic version, or even the
campaigns described in T:TNE), however, the referee should come up
with _some_ reason not to allow such weapons into the campaign.

A limit of laser power output to 50 * TL Mj is suggested.

I\'ll be interested to see the responses to these, myself!

In any case, my "major" SF influences would have to include (off the top
of my head, anyway - I could build a more comprehensive list from home):

The "MUST" (short) list would be: Starship Troopers (Heinlien), Space Patrol
(Smith), Dorsai! (Dickson), The Lion Game (Schmitz), Ensign Flandry
(Anderson),
The Mote in God\'s Eye (Niven/Pournelle), Chanur\'s Venture (Cherryh),
Hammer\'s Slammers (Drake), The Forever War (Haldeman); Star Wars, Star Trek.

Books:
Robert A. Heinlien	Nearly everything he wrote, but in particular:
			_Starship Troopers_, _Have Spacesuit Will Travel_,
			_The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, _Time for the Stars_,
			and _The Past Through Tomorrow_ (Future Histories)
Larry Niven		Lots; the ones that come to mind at the moment:
			_Ringworld_, _A Gift from Earth_
Arthur C. Clarke	Nearly all his fiction, but in particular:
			_Rondezvous with Rama_, _Fountains of Paradaise_
Isaac Asimov		Nearly all his fiction, but in particular:
			The _Foundation_ Trilogy (ignore the later books)
Edward E "Doc" Smith *1	Everything!  In particular: _Skylark_,
_Triplanetary_,
			_First Lensman_, _Space Patrol_
Gordon R. Dickson	The Childe Cycle (the Dorasi books)
George O. Smith		_Venus Equilateral_
James Schmitz		_Legacy_, _The Lion Game_, _The Witches of Karres_
Anderson and Dickson	_Earthman\'s Burden_, _Hoka!_
Poul Anderson		_Ensign Flandry_, _Gateway_
C.J. Cherryh		All of the _Downbelow_ and _Chanur_ books.
Niven and Pournelle	_Lucifer\'s Hammer_, _The Mote in God\'s Eye_
David Drake		_Hammer\'s Slammers_
Thorinn Gunnarson	_Starwolves_
Joe Haldeman		_The Forever War_

Television:
Star Trek (all)
Battlestar Galactica (ignore Galactica: 1980)
Buck Rogers (ignore the third season)

Movies:
Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi
Star Trek (ignore the first movie)
Buckaroo Banzai
The Heavy Metal Movie
The Wizard of Speed and Time *4
The Rocketeer *4
Raiders of the Lost Ark *4

Anime: *2
Starblazers/Space Cruiser Yamato
Captain Harlock/My Youth in Arcadia
Tank Police
Dirty Pair
Lensman *3


Notes:
*1 Steve Jackson Games has a "GURPS Lensman" suppliment in print, which
is an _excellent_ role-playing suppliment based on E.E. "Doc" Smith\'s
Lensman stories.  This suppliment is the reason I bought GURPS.  :-)

*2 Yes, I know that anime is (technically) movies or television, but I
think that the genre is different enough that it warrants a separate
listing.

*3 Theoretically based (without permission!) on "Doc" Smith\'s works, this
is really a whole different story.  Not bad, but not what "Doc" wrote.

*4 Yes, I know these aren\'t (strictly speaking) SF, but I\'m including them
anyway, because they\'re applicable anyway.

It\'s worthwhile to note that Marc Miller has read a _lot_ of science
fiction (I believe Loren commented "... more books that I\'ve seen in
one place before ..."), and I\'d be _very_ interested to hear Marc\'s
answer to this question.  It seems to me that Classic Traveller
borrowed heavily from many of the "hard" SF classics.

     That\'s okay.  The information you\'ve given me is enough.  
     Realistically speaking, I don\'t think then that an EMP pulse would

_Star Wars_, _Star Trek_, and _Alien(s)_ (of course), Larry Niven, Lois
McMaster Bujold, _The Stainless Steel Rat_, and various others.

Actually, I tend to pinch ideas from all over the place, not just SF - as
an example, I\'ve turned both _Candyman_ and _Appocalypse Now_ into
Traveller scenarios.

    Arenak:  naturally transparent, "five hundred times as strong 
    and hard as the strongest and hardest steel".  Initially 
    molded into shape as a "stiff, plastic substance" that 
    hardens into a rocklike mass.  The rocklike stuff is soaked 
    in dilute solution of sodium chloride and an electrical 
    current is applied, which catalyzes the final transformation 
    into Arenak.  May be the same as "transparent aluminum" of 
    "Star Trek" fame.
     Source:  "The Skylark of Space", pp 132. Used by the 
    Osnomians for their vessels of war.

    Dagal: not described.  Harder and more refractory than 
    arenak, but nowhere near Inoson.  Consider it to be a light,
    bronze-colored metal; the Predator\'s weapons may have been 
    made of this stuff.
    Source: "Skylark Three".  Briefly mentioned; apparently used 
    by the Urvanians for their vessels of war.

    Inoson: a lightweight, sparkling, transparent purple metal. 
    "Thousands of times as strong and as hard as any possible 
    steel", it was the theoretical ultimate in strength and 
    toughness for matter.
    Source: "Skylark Three." Mentioned in many places.

    Faidon:  a gem, "deep blue, apparently but not actually 
    transparent, emitting a strong blue light.  It cannot be 
    worked, cut, ground or even scratched.  It will not burn or 
    change in any arc or flame, it doesn\'t change in liquid 
    helium."  Could only be worked in the heart of a white dwarf 
    star, under conditions similar to those of its formation.  
    (From the description, it was formed in supernova 
    explosions).  Described by Rovol of Norlamin as "almost pure 
    crystallized energy" or "crystallized ether", its substance 
    is a barrier to all Fourth Order (gravity, mesons) and lower 
    forces (heat, light, cosmic rays).  When worked, it was used 
    to contain white-hot neutronium, used as a lens for Fifth 
    Order (tachyons) forces and particles.

Actually, it\'s an unrealistic, completely arbitrary limitation thrown in to
try to make
TNE look like Classic Trav.  There seems to be two schools of thought on the
TML:
one, represented by you and others, is that we should maintain consistancy
with
the Classic Imperium at all costs, and bend the rules to fit.   The other,
represented
by myself, Wildstar, and maybe George Herbert, is to go with the laws of the
universe
as represented by the FF&S design rules, and see what we come up with, **even
if 
 it doesn\'t look like Classic Trav**.  I also suscribe to the concept that,
if the FF&S
rules conflict with known reality, bend to fit reality -- i.e., we know what
performance
certain TL 6-8 technologies can produce, \'cause we see them in the Real World
(tm),
so if FF&S grossly underrates them, fix it.

Hey, if you like to that, fine -- it\'s your game. But--

If we are to hold meaningful discussions about ship/vehicle/widget designs,
please
clarify what rules you are using-- base FF&S, FF&S with your House Rules, my
House Rules, GURPS Space warp drives, or whatever.  The original thread was
about
the usefulness or lack thereof of BattleRiders -- the equation changes
somewhat
depending on whether you use base FF&S (big honker spinal mount lasers) or
your
House Rules (small turret- and bay-mount lasers only).  

As for my personal opinion: BattleRiders are very viable -- that damn jump
drive is very
dense, heavy and expensive, and we\'re using reaction drives now.  Dumping
every
unnecessary ton improves performance and endurance and combat capability.

Funny you should mention that...

Popular Science, July 1995, p.17: 
"Superfast Magnetic Bearings: Spinning at 36,000 rpm without any lubrication
or physical contact, a magnetically suspended turbine shaft established a
rotational
speed record for a jet-engine component that "floats". The magnetic-bearing
system
comprised of microprocessor-controlled electromagnets and sensors was built
by SatCon Technology Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. under an Army program to 
increase turbine-engine efficiency and durability. Further testing aims to
achieve
50,000 rpm."

I seem to recall quoting the same magazine a few months back about the work
U.of Texas is doing for the Army developing Mass Driver cannon -- I seem to
recall
also that said cannon will require a large flywheel HPG and a HIGH-EFFICIENCY
DIESEL TURBINE to charge it up... pieces of the same pie, perhaps?

Well, it is the latter, but I would argue the former.  It is only "realistic"
if FFS is *right*.  We know in many cases FFS clashes with reality (as you say
below), and contradicts itself.  All the other non-real stuff (grav focusing,
etc. is arbitrary as well.  I assume that the goal of the FFS stuff was to fix
as much of the problems with know physics, and make what\'s left look as much]
like CT as possible (remember that the entire point of grav focusing (design 
notes in Challenge) was to make the lasers shoot as far as they wanted them to
for feel--not reality).

I don\'t say at all costs, but if possible, why not (it\'s a shame to throw all
the CT/MT background material away----and from all the TNE stuff I either own, or
have seen, they not only haven\'t thrown it away, they make up new eqipment that
looks like the CT stuff, but shouldn\'t given the new rules.  There is not a 
single published ship that makes any sense at all given the FFS rules.  Not one
(well, in BR, BL, SV, PoT, anyway).  

If we\'re gonna accept the grav focusing as real, then I have to ask if the MGs, 
and other PA weapons use it...  maybe it\'d help make MGs useful (or PAWs).

I would only argue that the FFS "laws of the universe" are so out of whack with
reality that we might as well have arbitrary, fanciful rules that we\'re used to
instead of ones that are arbitrary, faniciful, and unfamiliar :)

I thought I did say  I was using the TL*50 house rule...

Also, when I post BR designs, they don\'t use any house rules (I\'ve tried to
make
design rules that fit *inside* the FFS system) that matter (that is to say
that
if I limit laser size, all I\'ve done is give the ship crappy lasers, but
they\'re
still within the rules.

Expensive--yeah, but it\'s only a few % of the ship, and I consider my 
standard 50 gturn designs to be *far* under gturned if they don\'t have jump
fuel to dip into--so we end up using all that jump fuel as Mdrive fuel.  

They make more sense if they have *big* lasers (no need for them to be spinal
since I think the only difference is cost, and it\'s better to be able to
point)
because then you only need a ship big enough to field a few large lasers to
do
critical hits on anybody.  In fact I bet there is little reason to make ships
much bigger that 10-20,000 tons or so with BigLasers (tm) :)

In short, I don\'t mind BigLasers(tm), I just think that they\'re not
traveller.
If they\'re TNE, then someone should tell GDW :) (and TNE then is an alternate
universe traveller)

Trying to make the TNE world, and the rules that designed it
make *some* sense (to me, anyway),

		-Merrick


Ob design bash concept:

PAWs and MGs get grav focusing.  We work out the equivilent mass of the photons
in a laser pulse, and figure out what the grav would do for the "big guns" 
(maybe it\'s already been done in FFS (?)).

If not, then think about the arbitrary TL*50 limit.  To focus the laser we need
to manipulate a singularity (more or less).  What the the eqivilent mass of this
grav field produced thingy, and what is it held with?  (given the grav tech
is "real" in the traveller universe we need to follow that to where it takes
us to).

If we\'re making enough of a gravitational field to significantly bend light, 
what is the effect on the ship?  Or the FA of the laser? (really curious on 
these, actaully)  Do people out near the operational laser fall into the FA?
What about dust, etc (or sand from sandcasters)?

Also, how does this (or would it) affect the maneuver of the ship? The spinning
ship (as they all do, right?) has symetrical laser bays (*huge* ones---- 1000 
ton ones or so), and half of them get shot off... is this ship like a big off
balance centerfuge now?

Getting back to the TL*50 limit, why expect FA volumes to go up in a linear way
with DE?  The Real World (tm) rarely seems to be this way :)

fine manipulation.
 So you can break it if you want with _huge_ lasers, but the range will 
suck on them big time. 
 Makes a good point for spinal-mounted weapons.
 They may not do as much damage, but if you get off hits at 80hexes away 
and they have to close to 40 to hit and you\'ve got equal acceleration. 
It\'d be a joke how easily the person who went with the particle 
accelerator(or meson gun) would win.
 So this conforms with Traveller reality, and it helps preserve the feel 
of the old Traveller.
 I like it at least.

Actually, I prefer the TNE combat system.  It\'s a tad burdensome, yet
very detailed.  It covers eventualities and situations that I will never
run into.  But let me tell you what I really like about it.  No one I
play with wants to deal with it!  Huh.  Well, a five minute combat that
takes about 30 minutes to play out is a tad too much.  So, the people
that I play with roleplay their way out of situations instead of
shooting their way out.  This is great, because when we play the Star
Wars RPG where the combat system isn\'t as comprehensive or lengthy,
they never hesitate to whip out a weapon, shoot and ask questions much
later.

Oh well, just my warped view. 8)

Now I would beg to differ.   I don\'t think that there is much to do when
it comes to making this stuff compatible with CT.  After all, if that
was the case then we would be moaning and begroaning the loss of
thruster plates and such.  I think that this rule suggestion/limitation
was done in order to allow for some semblance of game balance. 
Granted, why bother.  So what if the spirit of the rules is being
broken by a technicality in the new rules?  It\'s not like it\'s the
spirit of the game that we like.  8)

Perhaps, however, the intended purpose of the superfast magnetic bearings is
primarily for jet turbine engines.  Similar research is being conducted for
diesel turbine engines.  Floating magnetic bearings would reduce friction by
approx. 25%, thereby increasing efficiency and durability of the engine.
 Although such bearings could be used in a mass driver, no one has (to my
knowledge) produced an efficient diesel turbine that is capable of generating
the required charge.  In addition, "floaters" become unstable (ie. they
suffer from micrometer wobbles) in the presence of static charges (a charge
acting on a uniform magnetic field produces a perpendicular force to the
field - this causes slight fluctuations in the field and causes the
wobbling.)  Nevertheless, it is interesting...

eleven people are? I can see having a captain for any ship much larger than a
scout; once you get a crew up to a few dozen, you need a executive office
(before that you just have one of the crew double as second in command). An
admin clerk-type would probably be useful with the 84 person crew (but why
does he/she need a workstation on the bridge?!). Now what about the remaining
8 people?
        I also don\'t understand why a ship only needs one pilot and one
astrogator regardless of size. Doesn\'t anybody have shifts anymore? You
certainly can\'t keep your pilot on duty 24 hrs a day.

        Here\'s a few thoughts I\'ve come up with:
        - Department heads. Your chief engineer doesn\'t actually come under
the engineering crew, but the command crew. Small ships don\'t really have a
chief engineer (although someone will be in charge down there if there\'s more
than one), but larger ships need a full-time chief engineer who\'s more
concerned with running the department than running the engines.
        - Relief pilots, commo officers, sensor operators, etc. All the
positions you\'d really like to have manned full-time if you\'ve got a big
enough ship. Thus, the two maneuver crew members called out in the rules are
required for any size ship. Small ships just have to accept the fact the
pilot will only be routinely on duty part of the time. As the ship gets large
enough, you can add extra pilots, etc.
        - Other positions would be XO, admin, legal, etc.

        But I still can\'t figure out what to do with 28 workstations on the
bridge of a 1000T craft.

        Any inputs on this would be appreciated, as I\'d really like to get
these plans finished up and out to people.

    'body' => 'I have just tried designing a Tractor Rifle, using tractor beams to
accelerate a 
projectile, as suggested by Bri. As small arms weapons they actually turn out
to 
be a bit pathetic compared to TL16 gauss guns. This is mainly because the
length 
and weight of a gauss barrel is independent of the weight of the projectile, 
presumably because the force acting on the projectile is proportional to the 
mass of the projectile. This is not true for Grav Weapons, where a fixed
barrel 
weight and length gives a fixed muzzle energy.
Compare

TL16 Gauss barrel - 6000m/s, 24cm, 750,000m/s/s acceleration, 0.72kg,
   Muzzle Energy anywhere up to 1.1MJ for a 20mm round 

TL16 Tractor barrel - 322m/s, 24cm, 216,000m/s/s acceleration, 0.72kg
   Muzzle Energy fixed at 518.4J (velocity and accel for 0.01kg bullet)

The trouble is that this anti gravity doesn\'t actually act like gravity, as
it 
gives a fixed force, instead of a fixed acceleration.
Something else I\'ve just noticed - The tractor rifle breaks the law of 
conservation of energy with the greatest of ease. The input energy for the 
tractor rifle above, using a 10g projectile, is only 3J. Work done on the 
projectile is equal to Force times barrel length. The energy required to run
the 
tractor is Force times time. I can see why tractors and repulsors are
presented 
the way they are in FFS, as any alternative rule would have to replace thrust

with rate of change of kinetic energy - messy. However, bearing this in mind,

perhaps tractors should be an alternative technology?

One problem with gravitic weaponry now, is that without reactionless 
thrusters there are going to be problems with conservation of momentum,
pulling 
and pushing with a portable tractor beam is likely to throw the firer all
over 
the place as well.

Bearing the above in mind, here\'s a rough design for a gravitic weapon.

TL16 Gravitic Bazooka
Weight 57.6kg
Price  Cr11,137
Range  240m (laser sight for manual beam pointing)
Consists of two tractors stuck end to end. The operator points one end 
slightly downwards at the ground/a hill/something big, and the other end is 
aimed at the target. The thrust of the two tractors will cancel out, so the 
operator doesn\'t get pushed off his feet. The tractor will provide 6 tons
thrust 
for 6 minutes. The rearward facing tractor field is diffuse, so the force is 
spread over a wide area, providing a more secure anchor, but the forward beam
is 
tightly focused.
This device was originally intended for use in demolitions, as the forward
beam 
is capable of bending and collapsing structural members in structures which
it 
is aimed at, but it was soon adopted by armies and terrorists.

Last thought - considering their efficiency - 200 tons thrust/kl, 0.02Mw/ton 
thrust - perhaps you could use vectored repulsor lift to provide thrust for 
aircraft at TL16? It would only work close to a planet\'s surface (to around 
1000km altitude) but it would be an interesting use of technology. I haven\'t 
worked out the figures, but it looks like it would be able to replace HEPlaR
and 
Contra Grav with an improvement in performance, and it wouldn\'t need any 
reaction mass :-).

Man, I\'ve just been on a posting roll lately!  8)

Anyway, you forget that an astrogator and pilot are basically worthless
once their jobs are done.  Once you enter jumpspace, the astrogator has
nothing to do.  Once you\'ve plotted a course and begun manuevering your
ship in realspace your pilot has nothing to do.  These aren\'t jobs that
need to be done on a 24hr basis on a starship.  Granted, combat is a
different matter all together, but then again, no one gets to sleep
through that.

Engineering and such can be argued to be a different story on a large
ship.  As for command crew, divide that by three and think of that as
the the crew running the ship at the various three intervals.  That way
you for each shift you have three officers manning the bridge.

All the crew stations that you cited (that\'s in the deleted part of the
message--sorry), don\'t necessarily have to be on just the bridge either. 
Remember, there may be a number of console and stations in engineering
as well as others interspersed in labs and whatnot.

Anything with gunplay. :) Any cheap detective show.

eg. I was at home last week and and old episode of \'Banachek\' (sp?) was on.
He had to go discover how a complete 727 that wasn\'t in flying condition was
stolen. Substitute a small backwater planet or smaller planet in a more
populated starsystem for the semi-deserted airstrip in Arizona, substitute
some sort of interesting starship for the airplane, get a cast of suspects
written up... *poof* adventure. (If you like detective-type adventures at
least). Too bad I never saw the end, so I don\'t know how the plane was
stolen after all.

Reading sci-fi books gives you a good idea on how to paint the background in
your universe and other people gave some good reading lists, but as far as
solid plot lines go, heck, a little rubbing, some putty and an alien or two
and that old A-Team episode becomes a passable adventure. I love it when a
plan comes together.

Part of the reason I like this approach is that as a GM, I dislike running
plots ala \'Lensmen\' because I just don\'t dig on universe-wide, sweeping
plots. I also like to work in a good gunfight once in a while.

Hardware Wars: A low budge flick about a killer android. Virus anyone?
Ice Pirates: hilarious, if only for the Space Herpes jokes
Outland: Marshal Dillon (or rather Bond, Marshal Bond ;-) in space,

Actually, I believe that this is wrong, at least at TL-15.  I recently
posted two spinal mounts of 250-GJ performance, one a laser and the
other a PAWS, both with an effective range of 80 hexes.  It turned out
that the laser had half the raw damage potential of the PAWS at 1.4 
times the price.  The PAWS was marginally smaller, and they had the
same crew requirements -- one crew.  

The laser still had two advantages.  First, the PAWS needed to be 500
meters long.  A weapon with the power requirements of these mounts is
probably battleship class anyway, but it was one drawback.  The more
important laser advantage was that while the PAWS has a penetration of
1/1, this laser had a penetration of 1/400.  This meant that the PAWS
did as much damage as the laser at 70% the cost, to ships with an armor
factor up to half the damage value delivered by the PAWS.  The laser
shone in penetrating heavy armor, in this case over 1250.  This laser
could penetrate up to an armor factor of half a million.

Unless I made some grievous errors, I think that the PAWS weapon may
still be useful in some circumstances.  Meson guns deliver more damage
per unit of energy used to power them in comparison to lasers as well,
but they\'re large, expensive, and crew-intensive.  Of course, only a
meson screen or force field will stop them. 

Remember too, at over 40 hexes or so, you aren\'t going to be hitting
much of anything, no matter what your weapons statistics are.  Well,
maybe if you\'re Grandfather or are aiming at a *planet* or something.
80-hex range is only useful to keep the damage up if you do manage 
an extreme range hit.

Damage Tables & Systems

Essentially the same as the standard Type S Scout/Courier


Notes:

Ling Standard Products Deneb Division was contracted by the IISS in 1115 to
design an upgraded version of the ubiquitous Type S Scout/Courier design.
The design, incorporating the leading edge of Imperial technology, took
place at LSP\'s facilities on Vincennes/Deneb.  Three prototypes were
produced by the beginning of the Rebellion, they proved themselves to be a
more than capable successor to LSP\'s Type S(15) model.

The Type SZ was put into limited production for the Domain of Deneb in 1128.
The \'SZ\' designation was retained, as well as the \'Experimental\' tag, as the
Type S(15) is still produced in much greater numbers.  

The Type SZ has a number of advantages over it\'s predecessor, most natably
the greatly upgraded fuel capacity.  The ship\'s sensor suite has greater
range and capability - one of the SZ\'s principal functions is to act as a
\'picket\' ship for the RQS and Regency Navy.  Computer systems are also
enhanced, and there is a slightly larger cargo capacity.  The TL-16 laser
turret is much more powerful than it\'s predecessor, making the SZ a viable
escort craft for merchant vessels operating under the Regency flag.

Approximately 200 Type SZ\'s have been produced to date, all for the RQS and
Regency Navy.  This ship is not available to private operators, and much of
it\'s technology is embargoed under Regency Security legislation.

VERY glad to see that I\'m not the only one on the list who reads Doc Smith!

On the other hand, if you allow these materials into the game, you should
also allow Duodec warheads and Primary beams!  ;-)  Actually, in my
humble opinion, the right way to play a Doc Smith campaign would be to
use GURPS and GURPS Lensman; T:TNE and FF&S don\'t really like being
stretched in those directions.

Acutually, I\'m not sure _who_ on GDW-Beta first proposed the 50*TL rule;
it may very well have come from me. 

Let me explain how the rule came about: relatively shortly after the release
of FF&S, the folks on GDW-Beta were kicking around designs, and generally
exploring the new game system.  This is where the "Bogan Bays" came from,
the meson handgun discussion came here, and so did the first humongous
lasers.  Someone designed a "spinal" laser that had enough penetration to
go through a planet (or at least, a small moon).

After talking about this for a while, we came to the general consensus that
big lasers weren\'t a good idea - at least from an interest and play balance
point of view.  This is not particularly to make T:TNE "look and feel" like
Classic Traveller, but to make designs from FF&S "look and feel" like T:TNE
and Brilliant Lances. 

Look at the ships provided with BL - there\'s 1Gj and 2Gj "spinal" particle
accellerators and meson guns, but there\'s no laser bigger than 450Mj.  Why
not, particularly considering the relatively poor performance of such short
meson guns?  Why aren\'t there any ships built around high-power long-range
lasers, so that they can stand out at about 30-50 hexes - out of range
for the meson guns, but within long or extreme range of a good laser? (it
doesn\'t matter than you don\'t hit as often - if you are hiting them, but
they can\'t hit you then you\'re winning!)

The example designs and "standard" ship classes that exist in T:TNE and BL
look very much like what they should - presuming that there is some reason
why lasers more powerful than about 1Gj don\'t (or can\'t) exist.  Whatever
house rule we devised had to:

  a) not invalidate any designs published by GDW in T:TNE, BL, or FF&S.
  b) be simple and easy - a formula or a table.
  c) limit lasers to under approximately 1Gj.

Therefore, the suggested ruling is that lasers more than 50*TL Mj can\'t
be built.  There are _many_ possible PSG (pseudoscience gobbeldygook)
explanations for such a rule, which one you choose is entirely up to you.

Hopefully, this makes it seem a little less arbitrary ... in any case, 
it\'s our _recommendation_: hardly an official rule, but one that I (and
many others) use as a House Rule in our campaigns.

   To me, it\'s a question of whether you want to play a game that
resembles Traveller/MegaTraveller in flavor, or something else.
I support the concept of a power output limit.  It would be illogical
for there to be any development of PA or meson weapons otherwise.

Here\'s why: Scientist Freddie T. Smith (or whatever) is playing around
with some subatomic particles one day in his lab, and figures out
how to make a weapon that uses mesons.  His collegue, Martha Jones
looks over the figures, "you\'re right Freddie it\'s a feasible weapon, but
wouldn\'t be easier just to design a really big laser?"  Freddie,
undeterred, goes ahead with development.  But Martha was right,
lasers are simply easier to work with, so he drops the project.  The
meson gun is never seriously developed, and becomes a novelty item
until one day several decades later, when Freddie\'s great grandson
figures out how to make a communicator out of it.

   Spinal mount meson guns are a fact of life on _TNE_ starships.  You
have to come up with a reason why they were developed to the
degree they were, or otherwise you have an unresolvable problem
within the storyline of game system (I won\'t buy some BS story about
how the Imperial Navy was forced to buy them because the emperor\'s
megacorporation paid him a kickback for every meson gun sold, sorry).
Saying "lasers can only get so powerful" is much more believable than
"people decided to develop other weapons for variety sake".


Cynthia Higgins writes regarding a limit:

>Actually, it\'s an unrealistic, completely arbitrary limitation thrown in to
try
>to make TNE look like Classic Trav.

   As I stated, either you try to put in a figleaf to explain why all those
classic/Mega Traveller designs were translated over to TNE as closely
as possible to their original concept, or you just throw away all that
design logic and say, "gee, those silly Imperial types spent tons of money
developing weapons that weren\'t as good as lasers, no wonder they
blew themselves up."  It is a continuity question, ultimately.

   I seem to recall a rather large uproar over the relative ineffectiveness
of plasma/fusion weapons in relation to grenade launchers and regular
old CPR guns.  The uproar was so loud, GDW changed the rules to
make plasma/fusion guns more effective.  Why should this issue be
any different? After all, we\'re talking about inserting a short paragraph
here (one line for new rule, plus a few line of explanation), that\'s just
not that much for the purpose it would serve.

   You *can* argue, IMHO, over whether the limit should be 50*TL or
75*TL or even 100*TL.  Anyone know why GDW-beta decided on 50?

These two behemoths are definitely in the battleship class of mount;
the smaller displaces over 35000 tons.  Specifications were a 250
gigajoule discharge energy, and one light-second range to make it
a bit easier on the lower-tech lensing systems.  The figures for
power reflect a normal ROF (not raised to reduce Diff Mods).  It
was assumed that tech-12 computers are available externally, and 
no MFDs were supplied beyond the mandatory beam pointers.

For both weapons, the biggest component is the large HPG bank, which
is 500000 cubic meters in total.  The rest of the volume is for the
workstation, beam pointer, and weapon itself.  The laser lens alone
has a displacement of 9000 tons, while the PAWS tube is only 28 d-tons.  
The PAWS could easily be modified to have superior range performance 
to the laser because of the low impact of its\' small size.  As usual, 
ROF increases to the PAWS are also easier than for lasers as well.  
The PAWS also has the advantage of being about a quarter of the 
laser\'s price; and if the laser were trainable, the laser would be
even worse.  The particle accelerator also has an advantage in the
damage value it delivers against lightly armored ships; if the ship
has an armor factor of roughly half or less of the PAWS\'s DV, the 
PAWS does more damage than the laser.  With the ease of improving
the PAWS range performance in a more optimal design, this weapon
might be surprisingly formidable at tech-12.

The disadvantages of the PAWS, worse penetration and the length
requirement, still exist, but the possibility of extended range and
high ROF at a substantial cost savings might make the PAWS a bit
more attractive than people think, if you aren\'t going after heavily
armored targets like deep-site meson guns.  If you want lasers too,
laser bays are quite nice, and make a good replacement for the fusion
bays of yore.

I hate to admit it, but I rushed those two spinal mount designs
so fast that I made a couple of hideous errors (with HPGs, among
others) that I carried over into both designs and that ended up
making them quite a mess. 

I\'ve just finished fixing the stupid mistakes and this time I\'ll
send my calculations, too, so people can check up on them if they
want.  The mount sizes are now a much more reasonable 4500 d-tons
or so.  The laser gains some ground back on the PAWS, but the
PAWS may still have some points in its\' favor.  If I finally did
everything right, the PAWS here is equivalent in size to the old
CT/MT tech-12 PAWS-Q spinal mount.  My previous tech-15 design
would be roughly equivalent to the PAWS-T mount in size.

Specs are the same: deliver 250 gigajoules to one light-second.
Power consumption is at normal fire rates; the weapons aren\'t
even beefed up, but the PAWS probably should be since it\'s very
cheap to do so, and doesn\'t affect size much at all.

        Once you\'ve entered jumpspace, true, you don\'t really need an
astrogator anymore. But even once you\'ve plotted your course and laid in your
orbit, I still think you need somebody monitoring things. And what if he
comes down sick? Or what if he\'s just pulled a really long stint at the
controls, and you get mugged by the "VS Dracula?" You\'d prefer to have
somebody fresh to take over. I still think larger ships would need more than
two maneuver crew, and I really don\'t think you\'d want a separate astrogator
-- as you pointed out, he works for maybe 1/2 hour before a jump, and that\'s
it.

        OK. But I\'m still trying to figure out what positions those special
bridge workstations (twice as large as normal ones!) are. The ones for
maneuver, sensor and weapons crews are obvious. But I\'m still trying to
figure out the other 11. To show what I\'m talking about, here\'s the crew
breakout:


        11 Command (CC, XO, ???...)
        2 Maneuver (pilot & astrogator)
        3 Electronics (handling 4 commos and 4 sensors)
        20 Gunnery (8 sandcaster turrets, 10 MFDs and 2 meson screen crew)
        39 Engineering
        7 Maintenance
        1 Steward
        1 Medical

        Of these, 26 are "bridge" workstations: 11 command, 2 maneuver, 3
electronics and 10 MFD. D*&@! I just found an error in my design -- I have 28
bridge ws. The maneuver, electronics and MFD are self evident. What the ^%#
are the other 11 guys/gals/things doing on the bridge (or wherever the
workstations are separated out to)?

        OK, it seems command would also include a second, third and fourth
officer, so you can always have a command officer available. Also put in a
chief engineer, and a weapons officer. That covers 7 people. Any suggestions
for the remaining 5? And what about bigger ships? Add a deputy or two for the
engineer and weapons officers, and stash a spare pilot or two in here? Is it
safe to assume the line officers have flight skills, so they act as backups?
Then the 2 maneuver are just the minimum any ship needs with the extras in
command?

        I\'m also leaning towards a declaration that when FF&S says you need
so many workstations, that\'s just a way of estimating volume requirements,
and you wouldn\'t actually have that many workstations as shown on a deck
plan. In other words, instead of putting in 26 workstations on the bridge (11
command, 2 maneuver, 10 MFD, 3 electronics) I\'d put in 16 (maneuver, MFD,
electronics, plus captain/duty officer), and maybe one or two spares. The
remaining workstations would be ignored, and the space used for bridge
volume, ready room, etc. Comments?

[your crew breakdown deleted]

Looking over the numbers, here\'s what I can extrapolate (this may be
wrong, but it seems to work).  Give yourself a captain and a first
officer through fourth officer.  That\'s two.  Now for each department
that has more than 5 people give them department heads for every ten (or
so people).  Oh fudge, using this I come up with 12 officers.  Hell,
make the steward the fourth officer.  There, so here\'s the breakdown:

        captain
        1st officer
        2nd officer
        3rd officer
        4th officer
        head engineer
        2nd engineer
        senior engineer
        junior engineer
        head gunnery officer
        2nd gunnery officer

And everyone else can just report to the captain and officers respectively.

:         I\'m also leaning towards a declaration that when FF&S says you need
s
o many workstations, that\'s just a way of estimating volume requirements, and
y
ou wouldn\'t actually have that many workstations as shown on a deck plan. In

Comme
nts?

I don\'t think that\'ll cut it.  I think that you need a full crew
manning the bridge during a battle, and that\'s why they do this.  What
you might want to do to save on space is design a gunnery bridge and
place maybe half of the MFD\'s there (that way, you also don\'t have to
worry about a shot knocking them all out--look under design
evaluation).  Also, if you look at auxilary bridge rules, you could
theoretically split the number of bridge controls between the two
sites, and if they aren\'t both fully manned, then you would suffer from
not having a bridge (now to be honest, I\'m not sure if this is a viable
option, hopefully one the FFS gurus out there will point out if I\'m
mistaken...).

Anyway good luck on this behemoth of a ship!

down loaded most of the ship designs which get posted here, and a whole load

adventure plots from the net.  I also use it to write my own campaign stuff
and
designs. I am after some useful software for it.

Does anyone out there have any useful Excel(tm) spreadsheets for use with
designing ships (or anything else for that matter) from FFS?

In addition I want to start designing some floor plans, both for ships I have
designed and for adventure plans; and also want to start drawing subsector
maps
and holding them on my PC.  I have seen a number of these sort of maps on
various internet sites with traveller stuff on them.  I want something that
allows you to set up a grid and then have it displayed as a sort of
background to
the main design when printed or displayed.  Can anyone recommend a good PC
package for this purpose?  

Last night I actually set the PC up in my lounge and used it during the game.
I was wondering how many referees out there use computers on-line to aid
their
refereeing actually during play.

Any help would be much appreiciated.

The Laser in that pair was not a very well optimized laser.
It\'s not very difficult to do much better with range,
i.e. a "short" range of 20, or 40, or even 80 if you
want to... and it makes little sense _not_ to.

Assuming a Battle Rider game, the laser\'s lower damage
for the same discharge energy is almost always balanced
out by effectively infinite penetration.  Even a 10 Gj
laser is a very effective weapon, and one with a big enough
focal array to reach out and touch people at 80 hexes with
full power is quite reasonable.

I was wondering if anyone out there has converted the Garu-Class Far
Trader over to TNE using FFS?  Just wondering because I don\'t want to
have to reinvent the wheel if I don\'t have to.

Also, I have a question about fuel scoops.  How do you tell how much
fuel the fuel scoops can suck up in an hour?  In all of the ship stats
that I\'ve come across, all I\'ve seen mentioned is whether or not the
ship has them, and how long it takes the purification plant to process
the raw fuel.

Thanks in advance...

        That sounds pretty good so far, although I\'d probably leave the steward
a steward and just not have a fourth officer.

        Well, what are all these command people doing on the bridge? If I\'ve
got the Duty Officer (or whatever) and the CO on deck, why do I also need the
second, third, fourth, etc. officers? What are they doing, fetching coffee and
donuts? To me full crew for combat would mean the helmsman, all sensor, commo
and ECM operators, gunners, and the CO or whoever is running the thing. OK, so
you need someone to monitor engineering as well. The only other job I could
think of is coordinating damage control parties.

>you might want to do to save on space is design a gunnery bridge and

        This doesn\'t save any space ... the volume requirements for an MFD are
the same regardless of whether they\'re on the "main bridge" or not.

        Well, the FF&S rules for auxiliary bridges require that you install
workstations _in addition_ to the full number of workstations for the main
bridge. In other words, whether the "main bridge" workstations are physically
located in a single compartment or spread throughout the ship, they still
functionally only count as one bridge.

        I hate to think what I\'m going to go through trying to figure out the
actual crew composition for my next project, which will be something in the
10,000 Td size range! Thanks for the inputs.

Hi folks,

An odd thought and question came to my mind as I was doing my morning 
ritual today.  

In (Mega)Traveller, at what distances are battles between space fleets fought?
This brings up a host of other questions, such as:

	+	What types of activities are happening with apposing 
		fleets in the interim between detection and closing for
		battle?

	+	Do apposing admirals take pot shots at each other at 
		extereme ranges with missles?

Part of my thinking tells me that in today\'s Naval engagements you take 
shots at your enemy "over the horizon" with weapons that engage targets 
on their own, such as Tomahawk and Harpoon missles.  What is the Traveller
analogy to that?

Conversely, if folks take pot shots at each other from real long range, how
good are the missles and how good are the evasive tactics?

One thing to remember regarding big lasers is that you don\'t really need to
make them do much more than a BR damage of 8.  Since size -4 ships can have
armors up to 40 (30 is far more likely), a damage 8 laser will do at least a
temp hit.  All these lasers are gonna be reduced by sand, so I\'d rather have
a lot of "small" bay lasers in a fleet to overwhelm the sandcasters (not to
mention having a higher chance of an outstanding success).

I can\'t see why (short of the scrape things off the hull, and reset lame 
computers technique for non-military use) PAWs would ever come into use with
lasers like this around.

The whole giant laser thing got me thinking (well, OK, seeing a Babylon 5 
rerun was part of it, too :)

Optional Rule----Over penetration:

The BL rules have a maximum of 5 Major damage hits to a single location, at
which point the beam plays across the hull, and hits other areas.  I was 
wondering about overpenetration--maybe if the hit location doesn\'t shift for the
next 5 Mj hits, then you should take the 5, then 5 more in the opposite hull
section (internal), then penetrate out the opposite hull (external) taking any
surface features it might hit with it, then the rest of the shot is wasted 
(aside from any critical hits).  As long as the hit area changes, the beam is
cutting across the hull, if it dwells in one place too long it might go right
through.  (just a thought for all you non-TL*50 people out there (since the
smaller lasers probably won\'t be as likely to over penetrate))

Michael Bailey posted some BR conversions, I just have a comment...

Take the "Republique" Barque as an example,

the missiles are listed M:5(20)----since the FC is -4, then a given MFD could
control 4 missiles.  I don\'t have the BL version in front of me, but I assume
that it has a few MFDs to control missiles.  Shouldn\'t the BR designs (damn near
all of them, actually (if military)) almost always be able to control as many
missiles as the MFDs can?  Since missiles are easy to kill in BR, it makes a big
difference.

(I\'m not bashing on the conversions, it\'s a bash on the conversion rules in BR 
(they\'re either unclear, or plain wrong))

The Barque does have 5 MFD\'s, all of which are capable of directing missiles.

Well, the number 20 should be 12 according to the conversion rules, unless
the
ship has an auto loader.  As for the missile directors, you are right as far
as
the BR rules are concerned.  My point was that the BR rules for converting BL
designs make no sense in this regard.  Why should a ship that can control 4 
missiles with each of 5 MFDs (20 missiles) only control 5 in BR.  This
*never*
made any sense.  They made missiles *far* nastier in BR, but at the same time
madethem easier to kill----then they confused the MFD thing.  Yeesh.

As I said, Michael, it\'s gdw\'s fault :)

PS-I\'d count the stored missiles some way regardless, maybe in []\'s
M:20(12[8])
   or something (messy, but makes sense for small ships where missiles are

to defend against in TNE than meson guns (the \'unstoppables\' of MT). If big 
lasers were developed, especially considering their devastating effects, then it 
seems likely that better defences against lasers would be developed as well. 
Sandcasters are fairly effective, and 10,000t range ships probably would carry 
a fair few, but here are some other ideas:

1/Sandcaster Bays -I\'m not sure how much more effective these would be, but they 
should be better optimised for use of space, cutting down the amount of 
controlling hardware you need.

2/Fancy starship armour
    A/ Reflectors. I know that reflec was killed off in TNE, but the reasons for 
this were - it would be too crumpled to effectively reflect incoming lasers and 
the reflective surface would be destroyed by incoming laser fire too quickly for 
it to have any effect. I never really liked the idea of tin-foil suits anyway, 
but if your reflector was a big, rigid, carefully designed, thick, superdense
reflector, like a section of carefully designed starship hull, then maybe it 
would have some significant effect on lasers. It wouldn\'t require significant
volume or mass, perhaps a high-reflective coating over the hull - how reflective 
is superdense? The major problem in constructing it would be the cost of 
designing the reflector, and the extra quality control necessary in 
manufacturing the hull. The degree of protection afforded would depend on both 
the amount of money spent, and the tech level of construction. The reflector 
would probably give a fixed DV reduction to any incoming laser fire. Because of 
the cost it would probably only be used for selected parts of the ship, like
the 
front arc, which would put an emphasis on tactical maneuver which I quite
like. 
Who knows, by TL16, maybe you could try reflecting incoming fire back at the 
attacker.
    B/ Ablat. Another MT loss, this might be considered, but I don\'t think that 
it would be very effective against starship lasers, simply because the short 
pulses wouldn\'t give time for the material to ablate much.  

Finally, even if PA fire doesn\'t penetrate armour well, it does leave much 
larger, more untidy craters in the hull plating than laser fire. Enough PA 
damage, and even if none of it penetrated, then the hull would be so
pockmarked 
that the streamlining would be ruined. Probably not a problem for really big 
ships with fuel shuttles though (just as long as your fuel shuttles aren\'t 
ambushed).

Fuel Air Explosives are a very devastating weapon. SAS troops during the Gulf
War were witness to such devices being used, and one was quoted as thinking
that a low yield tactical nuclear device had been used.

The main ingredient of FAE is ethylene oxide which mixes with air and is
detonated with a relatively small explosive charge. FAE has more or less
replaced Napalm in more modern inventories. It is seen as being more \'humane\'
than napalm. When an FAE weapon is released, the ethylene oxide is sprayed
from the delivery system (bomb) rapidly into an area, say 50m across for a
1000-lb bomb, rapidly mixing with the air. This would take a full combat turn
at least. Next turn, the cloud would detonate. There would be massive 
concussion effect in the detonation area. FAE weapons are not designed to
produce a fragmentary blast effect although the destruction of targets could
generate fragments. The ground over pressure is immense and would set off any
mines in the area.
	This is one reason why the US and British military have the Viper
system on combat engineering vehicles. Viper is a rocket fired over a 
known or suspected minefield trailing a \'cable\' behind it. FAE is ejected from
the cable, the rocket, and explosive charge contained within the cable detonate
and massive overpressure results in destruction of all mines in a path 20 or
so meters across.

FAE is far more effective than regular HE compounds. In TNE, FAE would be
approximately upper TL-7/ lower TL-8. I don\'t think that a grenade could be
used as a suitable delivery system. Grenades would not easily be able to
deliver the amount of gas required. At higher TL, then this becomes more
reasonable, due to extra compression or something like that??
I would rate FAE as at least twice as powerful conventional HE warheads.

I havn\'t created any home rules for FF&S for these devices....yet.

Please let me have any comments or flames which you may have.



I\'m basically new to this board, and i would be grateful if someone would mail

A couple of things to note immediately: even at TL-12, capital ships are
going to have a _lot_ of armor.  The TL-14 Azhanti High Lightning FF&S
design that was done on TNE-Pocket had an armor factor over 1000; even
a TL-12 battleship should have armor somewhere between 500 and 1000
points.  A TL-15 battleship (or rider!) should be able to come up with
some 1000 to 2000 points of armor.

This makes the laser a _lot_ more attractive.  Assuming that a battleship
has 750 points of armor at TL-12 (and I\'m not sure how feasable this is, but
particularly for a half-million-ton or heavier ship designed around one of
these weapons, it\'s probably not out of the realm of possibility), then the
ship is _safe_ from the PA-Gun at 1.1 light-seconds or more.

At less than 4% more volume, and only 35% more cost, the laser is
practically a bargain!

If identical battleships were built to this general design, the Laser-armed
version of the ship could be getting effective damage (48 points inside the
armor, per shot) at 40 hexes, increasing to 304 points/shot at 20 hexes,
while the PA-Gun-armed ship couldn\'t penetrate.  This hurts.  Assuming that
the PA-Gun-armed ship managed to survive this to close to 10 hexes (and we
were assuming ships of otherwise identical design, so this is unlikely), the
PA gun would be getting the same damage through the target\'s armor as the
laser would.  At this point, the early hits by the laser, or dumb luck with
critical hits, would decide the outcome.

A laser with better range performance could be built, and could literally
slice a ship to ribbons at long range, and (although it\'d be large and
expensive), multiple trainable lasers would be possible as well - and might
have some advantages, if you wanted to build a large battleship.

Signficantly longer (total length of more than 900m) PA-Guns and meson guns
aren\'t possible - there\'s no hull that could mount one (although they\'d
have some attraction as deep meson gun sites).  To give everyone an idea of
the size of battleships that we\'re talking about, here\'s a table that
summarizes minimum ship size options for 250m and 500m spinal weapons.
For battle riders, in particular, the large lasers have the additional
attraction of not requring a ship of a certain size just to be long enough
to contain the weapon (the 500m-long particle accellerator, for example,
isn\'t very useful for a rider design).

       Slab = 500/2.65 = 181.8m   --> 300,000 tons std, 550m

Note about Possible Ship Types Table:

According to the rules for PA-Guns and M-Guns, "The length of the spinal
mount is equal to the length of the ship (in meters), defined during the
spacecraft hull design step.  Spacecraft with an open frame hull form may
not have a spinal mount."  FF&S, pp112 and FF&S pp116. 

Given this rule, the above M-Gun and PA-Gun may _only_ be mounted in ships
that have a the correct overall length; thus the "Possible Ship Types" table.

I\'ve listed the smallest "standard" hull that has at least enough length
for the design presented.  To avoid interpolating from the hull table (which
is not supported by the rules, and would therefore probably be illegal for
tournament play), the weapons should be re-designed to the lengths given
in the table.  Since these are close (slightly greater than) the design
length of the weapon, the changes should not alter the overall performance
much.  The notation (drop in!) indicates that the hull is an exact fit for
the weapon as designed.

This is what escorts are for.  :-)  I can see the logic to designing some
type of special-purpose ship with a large particle accellerator for
delivering large amounts of damage against lightly-armored ships, space
stations, and installations on airless worlds. 

However, it would seem to make sense that these ships would be relatively
unarmored (meaning armor values under 500), with faster maneuver performance
and/or better jump performance, and either a wide varity of planetary
bombardment and deadfall ordinance (for use against worlds with an
atmosphere), or a large contingent of marines and drop capsules.  

I\'d call such vessels "Strike Cruisers" and try to employ them in ways
suggested by their specialized design - as commerce raiders, escorts for
convoys, perhaps a few as screening forces for fleets of conventional
warships, and certainly assign them to the reduction of planets where local
space superiority had already been established by battle fleets.  They
probably shouldn\'t stand in the line of battle unless there were absolutely
no other choice - a normal ship-of-the-line would cut them to ribbons at
long range.

The laser range performance can be improved considerably, too.  I don\'t
think that the problem is that the PA-Gun would be ineffective, but that the
laser would be _more_ effective.  I\'m unsure how possible battleriders are
at TL-12, but at higher TLs, PA-Gun armed battleships would be severely
challenged by laser-armed battleriders.

If the deep meson gun site is situated appropriately, a PA-Gun isn\'t going
to be able to reach it - there are a few kilometers of solid rock in the
way, with an armor value that the PA-Gun won\'t be able to penetrate.  A
large laser might, though.  _HOW_ many meters of rock can a 1/800-2500
laser penetrate?

OK, here\'s my take on it; IMHO, the "command" crew require a bit of
imagination in otder do get them all doing something useful.  As a general
rule of thumb, there should be a supervisory station on the bridge for
each 10 crew (approximately).  So, skimming down the crew list, I see a
need for 2 gunnery supervisors, and 4 engineering supervisors.  Plus,
we always need a station for the captain, communications, and computer or
analysis functions.  Since this seems to be a warship, analysis makes
more sense than a computer operator, and we should add enough stations
to make a combat information center: perhaps a tactical officer and
someone to manage the sensor data.

Here\'s that final breakdown on the bridge crew:
2 maneuver (helm and astrogation)
3 electronics
10 master fire directors
11 command (captain, first, second, third, and fourth officers,
  communications and sensor officers, first, second, and third engineers,
  and a damage control officer.  These folks man the following stations:
  Commander, Tactical Officer, Fire Control Officer, Defense Officer,
  Communications Officer, Sensor Officer, Analysis Desk, Maneuver Engineering
Monitor, Power Engineering Monitor, Cheif Engineer, Damage Control Officer).

Commander - Manned by ship\'s commanding officer, or by the Duty Officer when
  the captain is not on the bridge.  Primarily supervisory; this station can
  monitor any bridge station, and has pickups and controls for intership and
  intraship communications (voice and video).
  Quote: "Lieutenanat, put B deck on audio.  This is the captain speaking
..."
Tactical Officer - Manned by ship\'s tactical officer (usually the XO) only
  when ship is on alert status or at battle stations.  Recieves and presents
  information from sensors, fire control, and analysis stations in such a

Fire Control Officer - Manned by ship\'s fire control officer (usually the 2nd
  or 3rd officer) only when ship is on alert or at battle stations.  Station
  can monitor any of the MFD\'s, turrets, or screens workstations; FCO
  assigns targets to individual battery contrllers (MFD\'s or turret gunners)
  and coordinates offensive fire.
  Quote: "All HPG banks charged and standing by to fire."
Defense Officer - Manned by the ship\'s defense or security officer (usually
  the 2nd or 3rd officer, but by no means always).  Station can monitor any
  of the MFDs, turrets, or screens workstations, Defense Officer assigns
  targets to individual battery controllers (MFD\'s or turret gunners) and
  coordinates defensive fire.
Communications Officer - Manned at all times when ship is not in jumpspace
  (note that electronics consoles may not be manned at all times).  Controls
  and routes intership and intraship communications, generally the first
  point of contact for any communication to the bridge; can monitor or
  override any function controlled by the electronics consoles.
  Quote: "The captain of the alien vessel is hailing us."
Sensor Officer - Manned at all times when ship is not in jumpspace (note
  that electronics consoles may not be manned at all times).  Controls
  and coordinates sensor usage, and preliminary analysis of results; can
  monitor or override any function controlled by the electronics consoles.
  Quote: "Three bogies - bearing 45 mark 17, range 8.0, course 12 mark 3."
Analysis Desk - Manned by the analysis or computer officer (4th officer, or
  on survey ships by the science officer).  On warships, manned during alert
  or battle stations (though the captain may elect to man this station _much_
  more frequently than that, particularly on survey missions).  Performs
  detailed analysis of sensor data, including target recognition, data
lookup,
  and computer operations.
  Quote: "Drive emissions match Zhodani "Zeke" class escorts.  Missile
    armed, plus a single laser turret.  Better accelleration that we\'ve

Maneuver Engineering Monitor - Manned whenever the ship is not in jump, by
  an engineering officer (3rd engineer, usually).  Monitors health and
  performance of maneuver drive, including fuel usage.
  Quote: "I\'m giving her all she\'s got sir - we can only keep this up
    for another 20 minutes before the drive goes into thermal shutdown."
Power Engineering Monitor - Manned at all times, by an engineering officer
  (usually by rotation between the 2nd and 3rd engineers, and the damage
  control officer).  Monitors the health and status of the ship\'s power
  plant, power plant fuel, and power distribution grid (failure of any
  of these systems will kill everyone aboard within a matter of hours).
  Quote: "I don\'t have enough power, Captain."
Chief Engineer - manned by the Chief (first) Engineer, whenever the
  ship is on alert or battle stations, or is preparing for a jump.  Monitors
  the status of the ship\'s systems; used by the cheif engineer to coordinate
  activities by the engineering crew.
  Quote: "Stand by for jump drive sequencing."
Damage Control Officer - manned by an engineering officer when the
  ship is on alert or battle stations.  Monitors the overall status
  of the ship, directs and coordinates damage control parties.
  Quote: "Minor damage on B and C decks, sir."

For a bridge this size, I\'d break it up a bit, basically place it on two
decks.  The upper deck is the actual "bridge", and would contain the
helm and astrogation positions, as well as the captian, the communication
and sensor positions as well as the engineering stations (maneuver, power,
cheif engineer, and damage control).  The lower deck would be the "combat
information center", and would contain the MFD\'s, electronics operators,
analysis desk, fire control officer, and tactical officer.

In normal operations, the combat information center would not be manned;
the workstations that are normally manned are on the bridge (which would
have at least two people in it at all times - the duty officer and the
power engineering monitor).  When an alert was called, people would move
to their action stations and both the bridge and CIC would be manned.

For combat purposes, it\'s all one bridge, but for role-play and for design
purposes, it\'s been divided into combat and non-combat functions (it\'s
worth noting that if you delete all of the ship\'s weapons and the people
that operate them, almost everyone in the CIC goes away).  It might make
sense to have the sensor officer in the CIC, but that means that station
is _not_ on the bridge (and is the only station in CIC manned) during routine
operations.

In the scenario I outlined above, the XO is busy keeping the tactical
situation in his head (and on the screen in front of him).  His job is to
be aware of what\'s going on, and give the captain recommendations.

The second officer is running the Fire Control station, he\'s looking
at the available targets that the captain wants to hit, and handing
them off to the indivudal gunners (the gunners are too busy, concentrating
on their individual targets, to effectively look around - besides, there
are 8 turret gunners, 10 MFD gunners, and 2 screens operators - if they
were all on one big party circuit, trying to communicate, it\'d be
clogged with chatter).

The third officer is doing the same thing for known threats (missiles,
laser-armed ships, and so on), and making sure he doesn\'t step on
the second officer\'s toes.

The fourth officer will be running the analysis desk, retrieving recognition
data from the computer, and providing data to the tactical officer and fire
control officers.

Take a look at the design for the Azhanti High Lightning (Suppliment 5);
there are a number of good suggestions for bridge crew on that ship - it
was originally a High Guard design, and required a fairly large bridge.

   Which is why I see the crew requirements as being the *minimum*
required to run the ship without mechanical assistance (droids, etc.).
Below that level and your efficiency starts to drop off.  How many extra
you want to carry depends on your ship\'s mission and space
restrictions.  Armed merchant vessels will have gunners, but not enough
to keep someone in the MFD chair 24 hours a day while out of jump.  On
a warship this would be an absolute necessity.  On large warships,
shifts could be staggered to reduce the number of people actually
required to run things.  It depends on how detailed you want to get.

   On a large warship, the bridge crew I came up with (after watching
more Star Trek episodes than should be considered healthy):

Captain
Self-explanatory

Executive Officer 
"Number One", etc.  On mid-sized ships, this person may also be the
Damage Control Coordinator (especially if space is a problem and people
and "doubling up" on duties).  Also can act as chief of staff for the
captain, taking reports from the various department heads and digesting
them down into something the captain can use.

Astrogator
Someone to make the jump to the next star, etc. work.  May also have
other duties assigned (such as Senior Gunnery Officer) on mid-sized
ships where space can be a problem.

Helmsman
Or helmsperson, pilot, whatever....someone to steer the ship between
jumps.  Can also take over as Astrogator in an emergency.

Communications Officer
Responsible for coordinating all the ship\'s commo traffic.  A bigger
job than it would initially appear.

Science Officer 
There are things in space that are dangerous besides vampire ships....
This person is a scientific expert who is familiar with ship\'s operations
and what natural phenomenon can do to a space vessel.

Security Chief
Or ship\'s troops commander--the bridge would be the best place to
monitor the action.  Would also be responsible for boarding actions,
landing parties, etc.

Senior Gunnery Officer
Aka Tactical Operations Officer.  The person in charge of all those
people sitting at the MFDs.  This is also the person the captain yells at
which he/she wants their weapons fired.  Note that this person doesn\'t
actually fire any weapons, just signals the crews to fire, raise shields,
etc.

Senior Computer Officer
Responsible for monitoring the status of the ship\'s three main computers
and any others that might be on board.  Sends technicians out to fix
any computer related glitches that might crop up in areas outside of
engineering.  In the NE, also probably an expert on Virus and Virus
behavior.

Engineering Technicians - 2ea.
Monitor the status of the ship\'s drives, life support, and other vital
functions from the bridge area and relay any important information to
the captain or XO.  Not *absolutely* necessary, but helpful especially if
the guys in engineering are a bit busy (and can\'t come to the phone just
then).  Also, engineering could *theoretically* be run from here in an
emergency if there is sufficient automation.

Chief Sensor Operations Officer
Responsible for telling the captain what\'s out there.  Filters the crap
the scared kid running the passive sensors picks up and gives the
captain the info he/she needs to know.  Would probably work closely
with the Chief Gunnery Officer and Science Officer (on mid-sized
vessels, the CSO and the Sci Officer or Gunnery Officer would likely 
be one person who would monitor both stations).

Maintenance Chief
The person responsible for sending out damage control parties where
necessary.  Coordinates all efforts to keep the ship functioning and
reports to the captain or XO what\'s going on.  Probably a member of the
engineering crew, who resides on the bridge.

Miscellaneous Other
The MFDs can also be on the bridge, or in a separate location (I have
a vague recollection this was the case in Trek, old series).  Any of
the above positions could be combined in some fashion and additional
command crew put in place.  For example, if the ship carries as part
as its complement psionically gifted individuals (as in ST:NG), they might
be of assistance to the captain during normal operations (see ST:NG for
examples).  You may decide that the Chief Engineer\'s place is on the
bridge (taking up one of the above slots in addition to his/her other
duties).  This is handy is you are the captain and you want to take your
XO, Chief Medical Officer, and a few sacrificial security guards down
to a hostile planet to show \'em who\'s boss (not that any captain has
done this in the past  :-)  ).  

>Is it safe to assume the line officers have flight skills, so they act as
>backups?

   I would want all my bridge crew to be able to steer the ship long
enough until someone more qualified can take charge.  This was 
certainly the case on Trek, old series, where even Uhura got to sit in
the pilot\'s seat once (if only briefly).  Then again, the Federation didn\'t
believe in seat belts either, so the crew got tossed around a bit,
and anyone was likely to end up next to the "steering wheel".  :-)

>        I\'m also leaning towards a declaration that when FF&S says you
>need so many workstations, that\'s just a way of estimating volume
>requirements, and you wouldn\'t actually have that many workstations
>as shown on a deck plan.

   The stations requirement is the stations requirement, and unless you
want to run a variant campaign, or come up with some negative
modifiers for not having enough bridge stations, you\'re SOL.

   Not all crew stations would necessarily be manned at all times,
but it is assumed that they are all necessary for the ship to work at
maximum effectiveness (particularly on large vessels with many
systems to monitor).  The extra space requirements for bridge
workstations allow for areas where the crew can hold meetings
away from the immediate work area so that they don\'t interfere with
ship\'s operations.  I see no reason why there couldn\'t be a Ready Room/
Conference Room adjacent to the bridge included in the design, even
with the full complement of bridge workstations.

    'body' => '        I have been following the Bridge Crew Debate with great interest,
and would like to make a couple of observations:

1.  Crew size / 6 is a very back of the envelope calculation -- anyone have
access to a copy of janes or equivalent that would offer numbers for
officers vs other ranks on a modern warship?  I\'ll bet it works out very
closely.

2.  I can\'t, myself, picture all these people on the bridge commanding their
six (on average) subordinates at the other end of the ship: occasionally,
you have to get up close to people and things.  Reminds me of the Lieutenant
from Aliens II

3.  Command structures, even with good communications, are culture/doctrine
dependent.  I am told, for example, that a Canadian destroyer has a seperate
Tactical Officer whose job it is to fight the ship, seperate from the
Captain.  I don\'t tink that this is the US practice.  And this distinction
is between two very closely linked militaries.

I am inclined to adopt my own "house rule" for my own campaigns:

a. A rule is a rule, so 1 officer to 6 O/R it is, BUT

b. Bridge function can be dispered, depending on culture and design, between
1-4 functional areas, e.g. Maneuver Bridge, Tactical Operations Centre,
Engineering Control Centre.

c. Although all bridge workstations called for in the rules must be provided
(junior officers have to have somewhere to keep their pencils) it should be
assumed that, most of the time, said junior officers will be somewhere in
their ship shouting at their swabbies.  It should not be assumed that the
bridge will be the duty station -- however, for ships doing plus G\'s to a
level requiring coaches, etc, appropriate workstations should be provided at
the station.

d. A bridge critical hit should be assumed to toast one of the functional
areas, and so disrupt communications aboard ship as to have the effect
indicated in the rules.  Full backup of all areas is required in order to
claim an "auxilliary bridge"

I think these rules are a balance between an interesting and varied reality,
and ship designs which could compete against "conventional" designs without
an unfair advantage. I invite comment.

Also, anyone like to propose some alternative rank names for various TNE
cultural groups (nth Officer does not do it for me)?  The sci.military FAQ
used to have some alternative terms for C20 Terra, but I don\'t have newgroup
access right now.

While we\'re on the starship weapons thread, I have a question about the
standard New Era rules.  I have only recently started running a Traveller
campaign and am still picking up the rules, session by session.
The last session I had saw my players\' first space combat.  As a novice
referee I guess the combat was conducted totally wrong, but as novice players
they didn\'t realise :-)

When reading the starship combat rules again, after the session, I discovered
a rule I had missed on my first few readings which would have a huge effect
on the combat.  That is the rule on range adjusting the difficulty level of
a to hit roll.  I don\'t own BL, which may tidy up this whole business.
However, my PCs own a Scout/Courier, exactly as taken from the TNE rule book
(with a few modifications which have no effect on combat).  They have a
TL-15 3000 Mj Laser mounted in their single turret.

According to the rules, the to hit roll is calculated taking range into
account as per the roll for sensor locks, and then that difficulty level 
is adjusted up by one level for every three hexes (or range bands) the target
is away.  This makes even an \'Easy\' shot \'Impossible\' at a range of 12 
hexes - which is only medium range for their laser turret.  Even if they 
had an MFD they would still never be able to hit anything beyond medium 
range, and from my calculations, no other ship would be able to either.

Am I missing something, or are long and extreme ranges in starship combat 
totally useless?

Thanks for your help,

Pete

    'body' => '	FFS: Gauss Weapons, Gauss Battery Error, Magazine Capacity

	After some fiddling with gauss weapon design rules, I decided 
	to use separate components for autoloader and HPG in stead of 
	a single "receiver" unit. This comes from the fact that a HPG 
	can be placed anywhere in gun, but autoloader must be placed at 
	the rear end of barrel. When separate components are used, the 
	minimum length of weapon drops quite dramatically.

	I also noticed that gauss weapon batteries are incompatible 
	with the batteries listed in page 66. For example, TL-14 gauss 
	magazine battery is 14.4 times heavier than corresponding TL-14 
	storage battery.
	Using current rules the battery size may vary greatly when tech
	level and muzzle velocity is changed, but the maximum grip
	magazine capacity stays constant. I measured several modern
	handgun magazines, and made a simple volume-based formula that
	can be used with CPR and Gauss handguns.

	In the following design breakdown I have used separate autoloader
	and HPG, and used normal storage battery.

	----

	Design example: TL-14 Gauss Pistol

	Projectile: 4x20mm Density 2 plastic dart
	Component	Mass (g)	Volume (cm3)	Price (Cr)
	Projectile	0.5		0.25		0.01

	Gun: Selective fire with 2500 m/s muzzle velocity
	Component	Mass (kg)	Length (cm)	Price (Cr)
	Barrel		0.45		15		270
	Autoloader	0.03		 4		  3
	HPG		0.2		19		 20
	Hollow Grip	0.1		 0		 25
	----
	Gun Total	0.78 (kg)	19 (cm)		318 (Cr)

	Autoloader is designed as Mass Driver autoloader. Weight
	multipliers are:
	Semi Automatic	30
	Fully Automatic 50
	Selective Fire	60
	Very Rapid Fire	100
	The length of loader mechanism is twice the length of ammo. 
	Autoloader is placed in the rear end of barrel, so the minimum 
	length of weapon is the length of barrel, plus the length of 
	autoloader.

	HPG values are taken from table in page 66. HPG could be placed
	anywhere, but in this design the HPG is over the barrel and
	autoloader. The HPG is cylinder shaped, and its diameter is
	2.53 cm.

	Autoloader and HPG price is calculated as in page 103, using
	price multiplier of 100.


	75-round Grip Magazine

	Component	Mass (kg)	Vol (cm3)	Price (Cr)
	Magazine	0.0237		37.7		0.237
	Battery		0.0520		20.8		1.875
	Ammo		0.0375		(75 rounds)
	----
	Magazine Total	0.1132 (kg)	58.5 (cm3) 	2.112 (Cr)
			0.0758 kg unloaded

	Magazine capacity depends on the total volume of magazine.
	The total volume of magazine is twice the volume of carried 
	ammo, plus the volume of battery. The volume of modern grip 
	magazine is around 60 cm3 in medium-frame pistols, and less 
	than 30 cm3 in hideout guns. (22.5 cm3 in one palm-sized 
	autoloader)
	This pistol is designed to be medium sized (as Glock 17), so 
	the magazine volume can be up to 60 cm3.

	Battery is taken from battery table in page 66. To allow all
	fire rates up to 50 rounds/sec, a 0.36 second battery is
	selected (price multiplier 9).
	TL-14 battery volume in cm3 is calculated as:
	(req. energy [j] x number of rounds)/(2.5 [MWh/m3] x 3600 sec).
	Battery mass is 2.5 g/cm3, and price is Cr0.01/cm3.

4mm Gauss Pistol (Gp-25)
Manufactured in Vyborg/Capella/Solomani Rim, the SAKO Gp-25 is high-power
selective-fire gauss pistol used as sidearm by Vyborg police and military
forces. The Gp-25 fires 4mm gauss darts at 2500 meters per second.

To minimize autofire recoil, Gp-25 can fire 3-round autobursts in stead of
normal fully automatic fire.

Note: This weapon have the same dimensions as TL-8 Glock 17 autopistol. The
major difference is that Gp-25 has barrel at the same place where Glock 17
has the recoil spring guide.

I had to figure out the layout of a Megatraveller designed monstrosity\'s
bridge once.  I found what I think is a "standard" large ship bridge
design;

Controls included a "Large Holodisplay" - actually several of them - I
interpreted this as one large and several normal holographic displays.

Begin with a large circular room about two stories high.  In the center is a
platform with the primary Bridge crew ; Chief Engineer, Tactical Officer,
Helm/Navigation stations, Damage Control, Sensor Off., Commo Off., Fire 
Control, Defense coordinator, Chief Flight Officer, and their 
workstations.  And, Of course, the captain.

Now, around this platform are two levels of workstations with
the subordinates to the bridge positions; so each "bridge" officer can 
"encourage" thier individual assistants in person and up close.  In the
center
of all this is the primary Holodisplay; a very large (4 meter?) holographic
projector which can be seen *from every station on the bridge* if necessary
for coordination.  Smaller holodisplays (6 in my specific design) are placed 
around the perifery for possible viewing by a sector of the bridge.

The advantages of this layout are two pronged;  Obviously, Communication
between the section chiefs and their nearest subordinates can be done
directly, rather than through communications which may be knocked out. 
The "over and under" levels allow more people to be brought close together
than a conventional \'flat\' bridge would, and everyone who needs direct access
to tactical information shown on the holodisplay can have it.

A variation which may be a bit more efficient would be a \'horseshoe\'
shape to the surrounding decks and offsetting the large display towards
the horseshoe\'s open end, and offsetting the command bridge the other 
direction; A little ascii art to illustrate;

The second advantage is this; by experience I know this bridge makes an 
excellent location for a firefight!  dozens of  half-height consoles face
inwards and make good cover, In combat the bridge is red lit and pretty dark,

so shadows abound, especially in the lower tier of the perifery.  Ultimately
there is also the problem of keeping the bridge operational after spraying
half the gunnery stations with autofire!

When the grav plates failed it got even more interesting.

The Azhanti High Lightning (I recall) also had a circular layout with,
in their case, a sunken bridge (was it called \'the pit\' or am I confusing
it with something else?).  That bridge had a great many people on it too
I recall (especially the warship incarnation), perhaps it would make a 
good guide?  (I\'ll dig out the booklet if asked.)

I think that you are confusing this device with a system called MICLIC,

Nope, you\'re not missing anything.  As far as I can tell from the rules, and
the
challenge article with the design notes, they assume ships are trying not to
be
hit----I would rather see it possible to hit something at longer ranges as
long
as they don\'t dodge, and have the table apply only under the right
conditions.  

As it is, you can\'t hit a *planet* outside of 44 hexes (I remember there
being a
max range regardless of modifiers), this makes no sense (what else is new :)

On a related note, can anyone with the rules handy tell me if the same limits
apply to laser, maser, or meson commo?  They *must*, otherwise I\'d drop the
range table if the target doesn\'t try to evade (the basic premise of my
surprise rules is just that, actually).

There are two problems with the reflec armor approach for hulls:
1) Micro-meteorites: Even if the hull is superdense, a starship
travelling through meteorite and micro-meteorite showers will have
her hull surface very quickly eroded, negating the specular effect.
The only answer for this should be a force field to repell the debris,
technology that isn\'t available at TL15. (A repulsor beam should be
focused on each particle, task that is not possible because of the
size of the meteorites involved, their speed and their number; even a
bunch of TL15 computers should be overloaded within a meteorite shower).
2) Atmosphere abrasion: When gas giant refuelling or landing/taking off,
or in tainted atmospheres, the interaction of the gases with the hull
though heating, scratching, etc. will also erode the mirror surface.

Hi,

Just thought I\'d note something that\'s bothered me for a while:  it\'s *much*
easier to hit things in BR than it is in BL.  There is one major error in BR
(could well be a typo) that contributes to this.

The BR rules state that the difficuly for a short range task is 1, but this
corrisponds to _Easy_, not _Average_ as it should.  Basically, all tasks in
BR should be one level harder (they seem to have gotten it right in the
screens
section, since the base diff level is 2 (Average).

This, combined with the fact that MFDs can reduce basic diff levels in BR,
not
just +DMs, mean that targets are engaged farther out than they are in BL.

The simple solution is to make the base shortrange diff level 2, then 3,
etc..

Also, one should only allow FC and overpowering "-" DMs to reduce the range
and
size "+" DMs (ie: it\'s *never* easier than the base diff level).


This is a *major* flaw in modelling BL combat on a large scale.  It must just
be an editing errror since it is sytematically inconsistant with BL.

Long range is useful with BL.
eg.
Long range = Formidable
44 hex range +14
TL15 MFD -6
100 ROF overpowering -2
Gigantic target -5
Total +1
Final difficulty  = impossible

Not all of these modifiers apply to basic TNE. The maximum range could be 
increased past 44 hexes with some truly massive overpowering of weapons, but
no 
starship weapons will ever reach the 80 hex maximum range. The reasons it is 
useful to have such a long range are to keep the damage up for any hits you
do 
manage at 40hexes+, and to keep the base difficulty levels down as low as 
possible.

Another thought for the Big Lasers discussion:
As I read it, critical hits are caused by large explosions, which completely 
obliterate areas of a starship\'s interior. It seems to me that lasers would
be 
extremely poor at causing critical hits, as they tend to go straight through 
things. I think GDW mentioned that lasers do cause explosions, but I reckon
that 
can only be minimal compared to PA explosions of the same DV, otherwise
lasers 
would not penetrate as well as they do. Perhaps laser damage values should be

halved or more when determining numbers of critical hits. The only problem is

that this rule wouldn\'t translate well to Brilliant Lances scale combat, as
it 
would remove most of the critical hits from the game.

the 
International Space Station, I read that the densest ever meteor storm had 
150,000 impacts per hour on the earth (atmosphere). Considering that earth is

many orders of magnitude larger than even gigantic size ships, there would
only 
be one or two impacts per hour on the reflector armour of a battleship. Over
a 
short period of time it wouldn\'t add up to decrease armour efficiency (the
same 
way cumulative PA hits don\'t reduce armour). However, at maintenance stops,
the 
damage would need to be smoothed over, which would probably cost much more
than 
a normal overhaul. Still, a really high cost would help explain why small
ships 
don\'t fit them. In terms of economy of scale, the size and cost of the
reflector 
would go up as l^2, but the volume of the ship protected would go up as l^3,
so 
they would be more viable for really big ships.

Also, atmospheric interactions shouldn\'t be much of a problem. Most TNE ships

need no heat shielding for reentry in the atmosphere because they have contra

grav. This allows them to orbit at extremely slow speeds, a fraction of what 
modern spacecraft need to stay in orbit. Equally, it means that the
spacecraft 
can effectively stop relative to the atmosphere, and just lower themselves 
through it at a very slow speed. Aerobraking would be harder, as the
spacecraft 
_would_ encounter the atmosphere at high speeds during this maneuver, but if 
only the front and/or sides were reflectors, then the ship could simply flip 
over and reenter tail first.

On a related point, why do starships need to have a constant armour value all

over? If you can outmaneuver your opponent and keep him in your front arc,
then 
why not make your frontal armour thicker? Given that most hull configurations

are longer than they are wide, then the front arc will have a lower surface 
area, and so require less material volume to make the armour thicker. This 
approach could also be useful for non-military designs. A trader operating in

safe systems would only need Gmax x 10 armour on the front, back and one side

(the side presented to the direction of travel when the ship turns over at 
midpoint). This could provide some weight and volume advantages. After all,
the 
10 armour on some traders is as good as nothing against lasers and even
particle 
accelerators already.

Oh, i think your right actually. I must have been confused. Do you have any
data on MICLIC at all? Length of line, vehicles with system mounted on it
etc?

Would an FAE system along the same guide lines be practical?

How about slope?  I was thinking of using the slope rules for armor already
in
use for tanks, etc..  You would say that Streamlined hulls get the 1.5 times
AV
modifier, and airframes get the 2x modifier from the frontal arc.  In combat
you would have to complete a tracking task to keep the nose pointed at the
shooter for the whole turn.

That\'s a house rule, not official FF&S. I came up with that
after the first round of playing with big lasers.

It doesn\'t pretend to be based on any kind of reality,
it just restores lasers to their traditional place in
the Traveller Ship-Weapons food chain -- "small arms".

The smallest PAW published was 1000 Mj, so they would 
supercede lasers as main weapons.

Why bother giving lasers (or any other weapon) a range of
80 hexes unless they\'re for planetary bombardment.
At TL 15, factoring in all possible diffmods, maximum
range you can hit anything is 50 hexes.

I think so.  I came up with it and hashed out the "why not *75
or *100" with Wildstar.

The CT and MT weapons pecking order was something like:

Turret weapons: lasers and missles
Barbetes: small PAWs
Bays: missles, PAWs, Hi-E weaps, MGs, 
Spinals: PAWs and MGs


The published designs (as of the publishing of FF&S) assumed, 
like with previous editions, that spinal mounts were the main
weapons.  With the loss of effective Hi-E weaps and bay PAW/MGs,
lasers expanded to fill the nitche.
  Also clear in the design rules, lasers were assumed to be
turret (or at most bay) weapons, due to the assumed crew of _one_.

Given the effectiveness of large lasers, being at odds both
with Traveller history and (if that\'s not enough), simply having
an interesting wargame, since the weapons mix on ships would 
logically collapse to lasers vs. missles (themselves lasers of a
sort), and this would get dull.

The smallest PAWs and MGs published are 1000 Mj.  I tried to come
up with something where these would be more effective than 
competing lasers _AND_ encompass all published lasers.

TL*50 Mj fit the bill.  Higher multipliers would mean designs
like the Chrysanthemums make less sense, since its main
weapons are PAWs.  *50 kept everyting existing to that point
and still put a limitation on lasers.

I designed a few of these, actually, by some makeshift
assumtions from the info in FF&S.

The REAL problem is the limited ammo combined with the
laser targeting sensor.

In the time the sensors have to make a fire/no fire decision
(not much), could they tell the sensor lock for a 2 Mj laser
from the lock for a 2000 Mj laser?

Probably not.  But that would leave them vulnerable to blowing
their ammo on small fire or holding back and getting gored by a 
big shot....

This totally escapes me right now and I can\'t find it in the rulebook,
so, does anyone know what the penalties are for not having a full crew
on a starship?  Also, what part of the rules is this in?  I thought
that it would be under the \'starships\' part of \'worlds and travel\' but
my scan didn\'t find it in there.

TL-8 Odour Supplant-Janitorial Robot [OS-JR]
 
The Odour Supplant-Janitorial Robot [OS-JR], commonly called 
Hos-Jar, was one of the first models introduced to the vacated 
automated maintenance & upkeep market in the Reformation 
Coalition.  Hos-Jar has been developed and manufactured back in 
mid-1200 by a small and unknown company called Barzel Manufactory 
[BM]. 
 
Barzel Manufactory started out in early 1200 as a family run 
electronics repair facility, which provided its services to the 
expending population of Delios Tradestation, Apollo\'s orbiting 
Class-E Starport. Due to Apollo\'s status as an Administrated 
Territory by the Reformation Coalition, there were barely any 
restrictions in the way of design and implementation of robotics by 
the RCSA.
        
This cemetery world provided Barzel Manufactory with most of the 
components and electronics needed, thus supplying virtually a free 
and a steady replenish of scavenged electronic apparatus.  Many 
market analysers, on Aubaine and elsewhere in the coalition, 
attribute it as the reason for their relatively high pitched 
earnings in sales. 
 
                        ----
 
Barzel Manufactory first released this model in an attempt to 
suppress the growing numbers of vermin in Delios\'s inner hull and 
service conduits.   They produced a small array of Hos-Jars to 
patrol and exterminate the vermin.  The Hos-Jar\'s low and 
semispherical hull, together with it\'s tiny arm enabled it to reach 
into the vermin\'s hideouts easily and brought to a successful & 
triumphant victory.  
 
Thus, the first introduction of Barzel Manufactory\'s robots designs 
became a favourite addition in Delios.   Their celebrated high 
speed chases after vermin in the empty fuel tanks resulted in 
numerous gambling pools in the bars.  Scores were kept for each 
Hos-Jar\'s performance, and later, even a tri-d Hos-Jar simulator 
game was released by Barzel\'s expending venture into the 
electronics commodity market.
 
Hos-Jar successfulness in controlling the vermin situation also 
attracted a number of transient Free Traders and Coalition 
Merchants to acquire the model for treatment on their vessels and 
as merchandise to trade around the coalition.  It is also rumoured 
that some Guild vessels obtained the model, but this information is 
not conformed.
 
Of course, exterminating vermin was only one component of Hos-Jar 
multi-operational capacity.  Barzel Manufactory added many 
diversified optional odour canisters to their Hos-Jar product line 
and transform it to an Air quality enforcement tool.   
 
For example, here\'s Barzel Manufactory\'s ad for the Hos-Jar:
 
"...be it in a marines\' changing room after a raid, aboard a 
scout ship with a shabby lavatory or a Ithklur-infested bar 
with no elbowroom, even in the maintenance bays of Aubaine\'s  
Starport, Odours can make you and your customers feel 
uncomfortable and interfere with their enjoyment of your 
facility and products.   That means loss of revenue and 
produces a bad name for your business.   
 
-So how can I solve the problem?, you ask.  
 
Why, here at Barzel Manufactory, we came up with the 
appropriate tool for the job.  Our Odour Supplant Janitorial 
Robot product will attack at an unwanted odours and restore 
the air quality to your normal standards.  The Hos-Jar, as we 
fondly call it here, uses a low  body configuration and a 
quiet operational mode to keep it out of view. It\'s swift 
movement will reach any area where it\'s services are needed 
quickly and effortlessly.   
 
The Odour Supplant Janitorial Robot model is also easy to 
maintain and inexpensive to own.   Of course, we back all our 
products with Barzel Manufactory\'s standard 20 years warranty 
so you don\'t have to worry about a thing. Our full catalogue 
of various Odours and pesticides add-on canisters is available 
at no charge.   Whichever odour you need, we can supply you 
with it.  
 
Our company offices and product exhibitions are available at 
most major starports (Aubaine, Trybec, Aurora and our new 
offices in the Kruyter system) and of course, you can always 
reach us at Barzel Manufactory\'s main offices:

Physical & Technical Description:
 
The Odour Supplant-Janitorial Robot model utilise a low, 
semispherical shaped composite laminate hull which provides 
its main structural support.  A short arm is based on the top 
of the hull, housing the odour emitter mechanism and a tube 
which is attached to the externally mounted odour/pesticide 
canister at the rear of the hull.  The arm\'s installation 
resembles a turret, with the ability to turn 360 degrees, thus 
providing an superb coverage of the area around the robot.   
 
A basic visual sensor is installed towards the front of the 
hull, just below the arm\'s installation.   It provides the 
robot with basic pattern recognition;  For example, the 
Hos-Jar will recognise Humans, walls, Hivers and everything 
else in its way as obstacles.  Although, it could also be 
pre-programmed to track a specific configuration, colour or 
smell of an obstacle.  Be it a rat, Ithklur or a foul-smelling 
vac suit, the Hos-Jar will distinguish it and spray it if 
so programmed.
 
The Smoke/Gas Detector sensor is installed alongside the basic 
visual sensor.  As described before, it can be pre-programmed 
to detect a specific odour/smoke/gas, follow the programmed 
instructions and handle it.   Located underneath these two 
sensors is the internal speaker.   This device can be 
pre-programmed with a small number of Anglic words and it comes 
with miscellaneous other options like Male/Female voice, voice 
volume and more. (Note:  Barzel Manufactory recently announced 
the availability of alternative sound cards for the Schalli 
and Ithklur languages).   
 
The Hos-Jar\'s TL-10 storage battery provide for its power 
requirements and is installed internally at the base of the 
hull, just below the CPU brain unit.  The battery is the only 
component used in this model that is manufactured & shipped to 
Apollo from Trybec instead of being scavenged from Apollo 
itself.   This high performance battery provides for 5 hours 
of continuous operation and is easily recharged.
 
And last, The Hos-Jar\'s robot brain unit.   This state of the art, 
TL-8, unit is produced solely from the finest recovered components 
available.  It resides on top of the battery, and is easily 
accessed by lifting the arm\'s installation.   The housing contains 
the CPU unit and the varied sensory pre-programmed cards.   The 
brain is occupied with Barzel Manufactory\'s patented PRAC/1 
[Pattern Recognition Algorithm Card, Class 1] (As discussed above, 
regarding the basic visual sensor).  
 
All of the cards, including the brain, can be easily programmed 
using a TL-8+ hand/standard computer, the owner\'s password and the 
MCE [Module Customising Extension], located on top of the CPU 
unit.   Just plug-in the cord to the computer\'s standard port and 
Hos-Jar\'s brain will display the options that are accessible to you.
 
                        ----
 
Referee\'s Notes & Adventure Hooks:

The Hos-Jar can be added to most Traveller/Megatraveller/Traveller: 
The New Era campaigns readily and can provide for a broad & richer 
atmosphere & background in the adventure.   The Odour Supplant 
Janitorial Robot is designed to be used as an NPC by the referee.   
Be it a minor encounter in the bar, or a mini-adventure on its own, 
here are some tips which can help you run the Odour Supplant 
Janitorial Robot Model by Barzel Manufactory in your Traveller 
adventure.
 
If you look closely at the Design Notes, you might notice that the model 
suffers from a shortage of power. This 0.000008 MW shortage is not 
obvious during normal operations, since not all of the components 
work at the same time.   However, if the power requirement is 
stretched to its limit i.e.: If the Basic Visual Sensor and the 
Odour/Gas Detector, plus the Odour Emitter, arm and the brain start 
to operate simultaneously, unknown effects might occur.    The main 
reason for this is that the brain is the main power hog in the 
model, thus it will be the one developing minor quirks in its 
operation.
 
These quirks can range from simple ones, for example, the brain 
won\'t shut off the gas emitter, thus, flooding the bar with sweet 
aroma which will irritate a group of Vargrs.  This will provoke them to 
pursuit the Hos-Jar down and destroy it, causing a commotion which 
may lead to various adventure hooks.  
 
- The owners wants the Vargrs to pay for his 20,000Cr Hos-Jar which 
  they destroyed and hires the PCs to find them and obtain the money 
  from them.
 
- The PCs help the Vargrs out by shutting off the Hos-Jar (in a 
  friendly way), thus gaining the gratitude of the Vargrs/Bar owner 
  which may lead to miscellaneous rumours/job offers.
 
- [More to come...]
 
Another problem with this model is that the arm can only handle a 
load of 480g while the Gas Emitter installed on it weight 500g.   
This problem plus the poor agility of the arm (AGL 2) can be used 
by the referee to turn them into either witty scenes
or terrifying ones.  For example:

I would certainly consider such a design acceptable for BL play, since the
hull area hit by an attack is clearly determined.  FF&S (of I recall
correctly) also allows for the additional armouring of internal systems such
as engines, powerplant, etc.

Neither of these rules translates well into BR; designs with differentiated
armour could use a weighted average, but I can\'t see a clean way to
translate interior armour benefits.

I think that the resoning about minimum armour related to thrust has more to
do with structural strength then micometeors; otherwise the minimum armour
would be a function of maxmimum delta-V.

    'body' => 'Howdy, here is my latest "bash".  Before I lose some of you "I don\'t want his
house-rules" people, let me note that with the exception of some fixes I did
on
errors in the rules (where they are inconsistant with BL) all of these are
plug
and play optional rules that fix *within* the BR rules as they stand.

Rules changes (and fixes) for BR:
 
Task Difficulty Fix:
----
All sensor, jammer, screen and fire tasks are 1 difficulty level harder.
This is a change in the *Base Difficulty Level*, this is not a DiffMod!
 
This reflects the fact that all the tasks considered _Average_ in BL,
mysteriously changed to _Easy_ in BR, even though the BR rules give a table
for converting TNE task Diff Levels to BR.
 
 
Overpowering DiffMod Fix (clarification):
----
Overpowering -DMs may only be used to counteract +DMs (same as FC rating
rule)
 
Missile Damage Clarification:
----
Det-Laser missiles do 1-6 damage points, regardless of success level.  
Optionally, allow 2 separate hits for outstanding success, but don\'t add them

together, it makes them way too nasty.
 
Additional Optional Rules:
==========================
(note that these rules are in addition to existing rules, and do not
supersede 
them except where noted)
 
Limited attacks by Spinal & Parallel (non-trainable) Weapons mounts:
----
A ship, in addition to the Multiple Firing Batteries (MFB) Rule (pg.19), may 
only fire a number of spinal and other non-trainable *weapons* equal to its 
maneuver rating in gs, minus every gturn spent on evasion and maneuver
(tracking
does not count for this, see below).  Results less than 1, are treated as 1.
 
The exception being that it may always fire weapons up to the number allowed
in 
the MFB Rule at any *single* target.
 
The maximum weapons bearing Re:MFB Rule are *always* in effect.
 
Optional addition 1:  A ship/taskforce may expend gturns on _tracking_. For
each
tracking gturn, add 1 to the number of weapons that may attack.
 
Optional addition 2:  Ships may fire more than the allowed number of weapons,

but add +1 Diff Level (to *base* level) for each additional weapon.
 
 
 
Advanced Sensor Rules:
======================
It is assumed that the bogeys that are represented by taskforce counters
(real, or false) were detected before the beginning of a given scenario using
long-time
observations with the ships\' passive sensor arrays (rules for this are more 
suitable for BL, than BR and are not discussed here).  All ships are assumed
to enter a scenario passive (unfolded) unless otherwise noted.
 
Variable short range:  
----
All active sensors may operate at any short range (SR) below their maximum
for 
various tactical reasons.
 
	eg: A CA with A:16 sensors may choose to
	operate them at A:2 in an attempt to lock
	nearby missiles without broadcasting its
	capabilities to the enemy.
 
Advanced Passive Folding Arrays:  
----
Because they are aperture synthesis arrays, passive sensors may be listed
with 
2 short ranges.  The first is the SR that the ship may use *without*
suffering 
folding array penalties, the second, in parentheses, is the SR for the
unfolded array.
 
	eg: A BB might be listed as P:6(8).  This ship
	could use P:6 without unfolding an array, or
	P:8 with its array unfolded.
 
Going Active:  
----
In addition to the -1 DM the target ship suffers from going active, the 
detecting player gets to calculate the base difficulty using the SR of the 
*target* ships active sensor if it is using its *passive* sensors for
detection.  
 
	eg: A CA in its detection phase decides to
	attempt detection of an active taskforce 60
	hexes away.  Its folded passive array (P:5(8))
	has a SR of 5, so it wouldn\'t normally be able
	to detect a target past 40 hexes.  Since the
	target is active, with a SR=16 detector, the
	detecting ship may attempt detection with a
	base difficulty equal to Long range (within 64
	hexes).  The base difficulty would therefore
	be 4 (using the diff level fix above), and all
	other DMs would be added/subtracted from this
	value.
 
 
Twice Extreme Range Locking:  
----
Locking is possible out to *twice* the extreme range of an *active* targets\' 
active sensors.  The base difficulty level is Impossible +2 (7 in BR), and
must be reduced by DMs to 5 to even be attempted.
 
 
Advanced Surprise:
----
Any targets that are surprised (see BR, pg. 25) are unaware that other ships
are
present at all, and are therefore conserving gturns.  
 
Under combat conditions ships use microbursts from their maneuver system to 
slightly randomize their positions.  The range DMs on the Player Aid Card
assume
these micro-evasions----but surprised ships (or non-evading ships with limited

gturns) are *not* making these micro-evasions.  As a result, the range table 
needs to be altered for attacks on surprised ships as follows:
 
Surprised ships are attacked normally, but the range DM is +1 for every 10
hexes
range (instead of 3).  In addition, surprised targets may be engaged out to
the limits that FC and overpowering allow, simply add a difficulty level to
the base
level at each doubling of range (+1 for twice extreme, +2 for 4xextreme,
etc.), and use the +1DM/10 hexes range table.
 
Obviously, only size will make attempts possible past a weapon\'s extreme
range.
 
 
Kinetic Kill Missiles (KKMs):
=============================
 
KKMs are fully independent (FIM), or semi-independent (SIM) missiles that
rely 
on physical impact with the target to cause damage.  They function as
det-laser 
missiles, except in the final moments of their flight, where they maneuver to

intercept their targets, then explode to disperse a cloud of tiny BB-like
shot 
that damages the target.
 
Launching and Detecting:
----
Same rules as BR page 13.  KKMs must be noted as such when launched.
 
Controlling Missiles:
----
All KKMs are SIMs, or FIMs, and are controlled as such.  I\'m working on a 
playable way to run FIMs----stay tuned.
 
Moving Missiles:
----
KKMs move in the same way as other missiles (BR, pg. 13) with one exception:
to 
intercept a target, they *must*, in addition to intercepting the target hex, 
have a number of unused gturns equal to the number the target spent on
evasion 
(regardless of success) this turn, *plus* any +DMs due to the success of
evasiontask.
 
	eg:  A ship spends 4 gturns on evasion, and
	draws a 1, giving it a +1 DM, any attacking
	missile must have 5 gturns remaining after hex
	intercept to attack the target ship.
 
Defensive Fire at Missiles:
----
KKMs are defended against as in BR page 13-14 with the following exceptions:
 
1.  Target Declaration----No change.
2.  Fire Control Lock----Same as BR pg. 13, but with
    an additional -1DM.
3.  Beam Weapon Fire----Conducted normally, but KKMs
    may be attacked *twice* by each weapon (KKMs
    become obvious to targeting computers since det
    laser weapons fire at a great distance right
    after the last chance shots.  KKMs keep closing
    allowing another last-ditch attack.)
4.  Dampers have No Effect.
5.  Sandcasters function in the same way as BR pg.14.
 
Firing KKMs:
----
Firing KKMs is done as per the rules on pg.s 14, and 18 (SIMs) of BR.  Due to

the diff level fix, as well as the more difficult nature of a <c fire control

solution, the base difficulty level is 3.
 
No whiteout counter is placed, and damage is equal to the Closing Velocity
(CV) 
divided by 2 (round all fractions *up*).
 
The shot has a high penetration, so armor is treated as it is for lasers.
 
 
 
===================================================
Designer\'s Notes:
===================================================
 
First things first.  The Difficulty Level fix had to be done.  It *must* have

been an oversight----otherwise any player character fleets would be at a Diff 
Level disadvantage vs. non-player fleets according to BR\'s rules.
 
The Overpowering thing is clear in BL, and unclear in BR, just thought I\'d
make 
it clear.
 
The rationale for the limit on det-laser missile damage seems clear enough.
 
The idea that a limited number of non-trainable weapons can actually engage 
targets seems to make a lot of sense to me.  Since all such weapons must be 
pointed at a target by rotating the entire ship, it would greatly constrain 
maneuver if too many targets were fired at, or too many weapons were trained
on targets.
 
The variable SR active sensors, and advanced passive folding array rules are 
more of the common sense variety, I thought many people would assume them,
but 
wanted to add them for clarity.
 
The use of the active sensor long rang, and passive locks on active targets
out to twice extreme is the result of the fact that the detecting ship sees
more 
energy than it reflects back at the active source.  As a result, it should
see 
about the same energy the active ship sees at twice the range.
 
The advanced surprise makes sense of the range DM table as it pertains to 
non-evading targets, and frankly, it was also a rationale for not driving
around
with the AEMS lit up all the time.  It would also have interesting
implications if one was to assume missiles did not micro-evade (kinda closer
to the BL 
designers notes in Challenge, huh?).
 
Lastly, I threw in my BR rules for KKMs.  These guys are really nasty, but
make
sense from a reality point of view.  I made intercept hard for them, and made

them easy to detect, and easy to kill----so you\'d have to launch a huge number
to
get hits on a big ship, but they would probably be a little cheaper to make,
and
they aren\'t nukes (sometimes an important factor).
 
Once again, let me know what you think!

This isn\'t the case in the rules, MFDs only negate +DMs.  /fwap merrick

I threw this design together after long ignorance of my TNE
material. I just wanted to test out few lower tech things a
bit, and tried to make a nice assault tank initially. Then I
noticed that a vehicle of this size does not take too well
for a full sized turret (I would run out of space even with
one crewstation in it, as would be required), so I decided to 
change it to simple, low-cost assault vehicle instead.
Note that because of the 2-man crew, only one of the weapons
can be fired at any one time, as the gunner can hardly
concentrate on both. The small turret mounting the machinegun
is on the top of the vehicle, and has full 360 degree fire
arc.

If u spot any flaws in the design (there might be some, like
I said, this was my first design in a long while), please
notify me so I can correct them. I do have the design notes
of this thing still, though at the moment they are barely
readable... ;) However, I will type those up if anyone wants
them.

PS. As a footnote, I have done few other designs after this
(mainly checking out old MT designs from the 101 Vehicles),
and have noticed that creating small low-tech vehicles is
real hard with these rules, and installing a regular
turret is practically impossible.
Otherwise this wouldn\'t bother me so much, but I would like to
use disp 2-5 low tech tanks in my game, and the multipliers
on the volume of turrets forces me to adapt small turrets,
which are the only-ones that can be remoted mounted. As even
at this tech level 6 any crewstation in the turret would take
out *14* cubic meters of volume!
Anyone else had this problem before? If so, any solutions to it?

sorry for the stupid question, but I\'m new both to Traveller and this 
list. I just skimmed over the rules for Briliant Lances and Fire, 
Fusion and Steel, and there is one thing I don\'t  understand:

why are all the ship-to-ship missiles nuclear-powered laser warheads? 
Why doesn\'t anyone use simple nuclear warheads instead?

In Brilliant Lances, the missiles have to reach the hex the target is 
located in, so there is no advantage (in game terms) in firing a 
laser from some (relatively close) distance, as opposed to moving 
near the target and detonating a warhead (like better survivability 
of the missile due to lesser likelihood of being shot down. Doesn\'t 
apply if you have to reach the target\'s hex).

Am I missing something? Do I misinterpret a rule? Any hints?

I like the systems introduced in FF&S (although I haven\'t tested them 
thoroughly yet). They give you a lot of freedom, and explain neatly 
why things are as they are. Everywhere, that is, except in the case 
of the space missiles...

Well, excuse my ignorance, and thanks a lot for any clues...

                            19 Jul 3002

* The Earthsteward announced today that the Empire of Aztlan has declared 
war upon the Commonwealth.  Speaking from the Stewards\' Hall, Mr. Cevera 
indicated that the Empire\'s Ambassador had delivered the formal 
Declaration earlier today.  The State of War became effective today and 
was delivered simultaneously with a formal announcement on Aztlan in 
Procyon District.

* The Earthsteward called for resolve on the part of the citizenry in 
facing this crisis.  "We will defend ourselves and protect our freedom 
throughout the Colonies Sphere," he said in a live address that will be 
broadcast on all Commonwealth worlds.  "Let no one forget who is the 
aggressor here.  The Empire of Aztlan has long sought the way of the 
warrior over that of the diplomat.  While we would prefer the latter we 
are well prepared and determined to oppose former."

* Speaking after the Earthsteward, Security Affairs Minister Fokin 
suggested that Aztlan forces had already begun hostilities in Pollux 
District.  "The Empire\'s military forces have been probing our defenses 
in Pollux for months now," she said.  "They will soon learn that they 
have miscalculated gravely.  We have more than sufficient force in Pollux 
and neighboring districts to repulse any Aztlan incursion."

* A source in the Security Ministry said an Aztlan assault upon Earth was 
unlikely.  The source suggested Aztlan strategy would seek to intimidate 
independent worlds in Pollux and neighboring districts through assaults 
upon Commonwealth forces in the region.  The source indicated that the 
Declaration was not unanticipated in the Ministry and that Commonwealth 
forces in Pollux had been reinforced in recent months.

* "The campaign will most likely be centered around the world of 
Prometheus," said the source.  Prometheus in a member of the Commonwealth 
and its population is nearly six billion.  "While the Aztlan have no hope 
of overcoming the defenses at Prometheus they might be able to cut the 
world off by seizing neighboring systems," continued the source.  "The 
challenge for our forces will be to prevent that from occurring."

* A spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry indicated that the 
Commonwealth had briefed the Missions of several Colonial States but that 
most had insisted upon the need to consult with their Governments before 
taking a position upon the State of War.  The Commonwealth has no 
alliances with major Colonial States nor does the Empire.  A source 
within the Ministry suggested that the major Colonial States would remain 
neutral in the conflict.**

                          Introducing . . .

                         *MELBOURNE TIMES*

*Melbourne Times* is a quarterly fanzine dedicated to the development of 
the Earth Colonies campaign background for science fiction role-playing 
games.  This generic campaign background is compatible with any RPG rules 
set.

The Earth Colonies campaign is focused on 31st Century Earth and its 
surrounding interstellar community.  The campaign utilizes a 
three-dimensional campaign area - actual three-dimensional maps of 
Earth\'s interstellar neighborhood will be used for the campaign.

Other unique features abound.  There are several rival states - 
independent communities originally settled from Earth: the expansionist 
Empire of Aztlan, the cosmopolitan Federation of Nyanza, the mercantile 
Ouroran Community, the missionary Abrahamic Synod, and several others, as 
well as the Commonwealth of Earth itself.

There are completely new non-human races: the terrestrial Dolphins - 
co-equal partners with Humans, the aerial Aeroi who abhor violence but 
dominate interstellar trade in the Colonies Sphere, and the aquarian 
Meren who often resort to militarism in their quest to control hospitable 
hydrospheres.  As many as 24 other alien races may border the Colonies 
Sphere.

Technological capability of the Commonwealth and the major Colonial 
States, as well as of the Aeroi and Meren, represents a campaign peak.  
Interstellar travel is not commonplace with four parsecs per week speeds 
only available to the most advanced military and technical users.  The 
vast, low-density stellar neighborhood of the Colonies Sphere adds some 
interesting aspects to star travel.

The most unique aspect of the Earth Colonies campaign is its newness and 
vitality.  Much of the region has yet to be explored, and even less has 
been \'developed\' by the campaign developers.  There are rich 
opportunities for both developers and players in the undiscovered country 
of the Colonies Sphere.

I have a lot of BL stuff, too, but I\'m gonna clean it up a little.

A lot of the ideas for KKMs had their start on the gdw-beta list.  When I get
all this stuff on my homepage, I\'ll have a bibliography.

As for the FIMs, they\'re not hard to design (who am I kidding, they\'re no
harder to design than any other missile----which is a pain :)

The real problem is making rules for *using* them in BR/BL.  It isn\'t too bad
if you assume they\'re pretty smart, because you can just drive them like
ships.
I am working on homing rules that require FIMs to operate in a certain
way----if
you shoot a FIM under the same conditions, it should do more or less the same
thing it did last time (under same cond.s).

-Merrick

PS-Most of my BL stuff is related to sensors.  Andrew (AD Venturer) has some
really great stuff in this area as well.  His rules are more of a total
rewrite
of the sensor rules than mine are, but I like them a lot.  Mine are better if
you need a system of optional rules that sit on top of the existing BL rules,

but since so many of the BL rules are screwy, either one will work (now I
just
need to clean mine up, and get it on my homepage).

        Could you post an example? I tried several months ago, and came up
with 
a bunch of questions for GDW which I posted on GEnie. I didn\'t really get any

useful answers back. The biggest problem (which GDW acknowledged) was that
they 
hadn\'t provided the guidance systems for space missiles in FF&S. Now that
I\'ve 
got Vampire Ships, I assume I could just couple a robot brain and a flight 
computer to get something to run a FIM. Anyway, I\'d appreciate a sample of
one 
you\'ve done. Thanks!

>why are all the ship-to-ship missiles nuclear-powered laser warheads? 
>Why doesn\'t anyone use simple nuclear warheads instead?

        The assumption is that a simple (i.e. contact) nuclear missile would
be 
shot down long before it got close enough to actually do any damage to the
ship. 
Since there\'s no atmosphere to carry the blast effects, the energy dissipates

rapidly with distance. You basically have to hit the target. And if your
target 
has lasers and targetting systems capable of hitting ships 1,200,000 km
away, it 
can certainly nail anything big enough to carry a warhead before it gets
within 
a thousand.

        You\'re forgetting that being in the same hex isn\'t very close -- a
hex 
is still 30,000km across. Once again, your nuclear missile is going to be 
toasted long before it gets close to the target. That\'s why you use the 
detonation laser instead.

I\'ve been trying to convert some of old MT designs over to TNE using
FFS (wow, how\'s that for a sentence full o\' acronyms).

Anyway, I came upon a very puzzling question which I\'m hoping someone
out there may answer (and if not, then maybe one of the folks from GDW
could).

Just exactly what is the deal with the number of staterooms one the
TL-10 Moraine Class and the TL-15 Beowulf Class free traders and the
TL-12 Jayhawk far trader.  According to the ship stats for TNE, they
have two times the number of staterooms as before!

The only thing that I could come up with was that the numbers listed
under the crew and passenger accomodations section was that the numbers
listed are for double-occupancy in a small stateroom.  That way the
Beowulf or Moraine have 5/9 and 6/8 (crew/passenger) respectively which
is more in line with the old MT design which had 9 staterooms.

However, I haven\'t come across anything in the rules that stats this is
what has been done, or that small staterooms are automatically
considered double-occupancy (even for middle passage).

So, my question is, what\'s the deal?  Do all of the ships nowadays have
twice as many passenger staterooms as before?  And if so, then why were
they designed that way instead of giving over all of that space to the
cargo hold (especially for the free and far traders)?

Please, please, please someone answer this for me, it\'s left my head
all twisted for the past day or so...

I was looking through the Traveller:The New Era character
generation sequence, and decided, based on my personal real-world
experience, that the Law Enforcement career could be improved
somewhat.

For the record, I live in a small town (about 15,000 people) and
work for the New York City Police Department (about 40,000
uniformed members of all ranks, serving a city of 12,000,000
people).  I have made it my business to be familiar with police
operations to the greatest extent possible in both departments.  I
have also heard about other departments from police officers who
have transferred in, or who have done exchanges with other
departments.

In general, there will be two kinds of Police Departments for the
purposes of character generation: small departments and large
departments.  The mission is not dependent on size, but the
department table of organization will be strongly affected, as will
the ranks and some skills attainable by members of the service.

A note on terminology - a "member of the service" refers to any
individual working for a police department.  A "UMOS" (Uniformed
Member Of Service) refers to any member of the service that is
issued a shield and a sidearm.  A "Cop" is a UMOS of rank below
Lieutenant; an "Officer" is a UMOS of rank Lieutenant or above.

SIZING THE DEPARTMENT

For the purposes of determining whether a department is considered
large or small, some information about local population _density_
and area covered by the department must be available.  For the
purpose of discussion, interpret the population density level (PDL)
number as you would a population number, i.e., as an exponent of
ten, but with units of people per square kilometer rather than just
people.  If you\'re one of those people who likes to compute this by
using the "log10" key on your calculator or in your computer
program, round down.

My rule of thumb:  If the PDL is less than 4 in the area covered
by a single department, _and_ the area covered by a single
department has a population level less than 5, the department is
small.  Departments that have other departments operating partially
or totally within their jurisdiction are automatically large.
Thus, using the United States as an example, Westchester County,
New York, has several towns, cities, and villages.  The Village of
Pelham has a population of about 6,000 in 2.25 square kilometers.
This yields a PDL of 3 (3.42, actually).  The Village of Pelham has
a small department.  The County of Westchester has a population of
867,000 in 1192.50 square kilometers.  This yields a PDL of 2
(2.86).  However, the population level is 5, almost 6, _and_ there
are departments operating in smaller areas of Westchester County.
Therefore, the Westchester County Parkway Police Department is a
large department, as is the New York State Police Department.

The City of New York has 12,000,000 people in an area of about
1,000 square kilometers.  This gives a PDL of 4 (4.07).  This alone
is enough to make the New York City Police Department a large
department, as is the population level of 7.

TABLE OF ORGANIZATION

Small departments are generally unitary, with no division into
bureaus for functional separation, nor into precincts for
operational separation.  Large departments frequently have both.
The typical small department can be treated as a single precinct
for its table of operation.

The typical precinct is commanded by an officer of rank O2 or
higher.  This individual is responsible for overall coordination of
activities that occur both within the police station or out in the
operational area, for the entire 24-hour period of the standard
day.  In large departments, or in jurisdictions where there is a
lot of crime, he may be assisted by an executive officer whose rank
in small departments is at least one lower than his (but still at
least O1) or in large departments may be equal in rank.

There are three "platoons" in a precinct or a small department -
one for each eight-hour period of the standard day.  Platoons are
generally lettered in the Anglic alphabet, with each platoon being
listed as on-duty over a specific eight-hour period.  Each platoon
is led by a Lieutenant, who is responsible for coordinating
operations in the operational area for the period during which his
platoon is on-duty.  The Lieutenant is also responsible for
reporting his platoon\'s activity to the commanding officer, and for
passing on information to the following platoon about conditions
requiring special attention.  Staffing of the police station (i.e.,
ensuring that a sufficient number of Police Officers are in the
station at all time to take walk-in reports of crimes and to
process arrests) is the responsibility of the Lieutenant, as well.

Each platoon is divided up into several squads.  Each squad works a
sequence of days on-duty, followed by a shorter sequence of days
off-duty.  Squads work so that there is sufficient coverage each
day, and so that over a long period of time, each squad\'s on-duty
time is twice its off-duty time.  Squads are headed by Sergeants,
who are responsible for ensuring that all information required by
the platoon commander is collected from the police officers, and
for monitoring the performance of the Police Officers in his squad.

In small departments, the Detectives are usually considered a squad
on special assignment, but see the notes on Detectives in large
departments.

Administrative duties may be handled by Police Officers given a
"special assignment" of Staff, or by civilian bureaucrats (unranked
clerks) specifically hired for the purpose.

Large departments may have additional levels of command - for
example, a Division Command may have oversight and data collection
responsibilities for several precincts.  Large departments always
have a headquarters separate from a precinct, which has ultimate
overall responsibility for operational oversight and strategic
planning for the department as a whole.  Large departments are
generally divided up into operational bureaus, as follows:

Patrol Service - responsible for day-to-day patrol operation of
uniformed officers.  These officers are the ones that respond to
emergency calls and crimes-in-progress, and who act as a deterrent
by their presence.

Detective Service - responsible for investigation and information
development of crimes-completed (in the past).  May also arrange
and execute "sting" and under-cover operations.

Internal Affairs - responsible for investigating allegations of
misconduct by members of the service.  Responsible for proffering
specifications for departmental hearings.

Information Systems - responsible for maintaining computer systems
and software, and development and purchase of same.

Physical Plant - responsible for maintenance of physical facilities
of the department.

Quartermaster - responsible for supply and maintenance of equipment
and consumables required for department operations.

Information Systems, Physical Plant, and Quartermaster may be
contracted out to non-governmental firms, or to other government
agencies.  Patrol Service and Detective Service operate
"round-the-clock" (but see below).  Other bureaus generally operate
only during "normal business hours".

Detectives are not generally organized into platoons and squads as
patrol officers are.  Instead, each detective sets his/her own
hours based on the needs of any cases and/or "stings" or
under-cover operations he/she is currently working on.  Hours spent
on-duty must conform over the course of one fiscal year to the
same ratio as is required of Patrol Officers.

RANKS AND TYPICAL TITLES (as used in the United States)

There are two "classes" of UMOS, similar to the "enlisted" and
"officer" division of military forces.  Typically, they are
referred to as "Patrol officers" (cops, or enlisted) and
"Supervisors" (officers).  In this classification, Patrol officers
includes detectives of rank E2 and E4, and Supervisors includes all
ranks O1 and above.

The table below gives the rank number and rank title for all ranks.
Where "----" appears in the Detectives column, it means that the
Detective Service bureau does not use that rank.  Ranks marked with
"*" may be omitted by some departments; see the notes following the
table.

Rank #  Standard Title            Detectives
~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            ~~~~~~~~~~
E1*     Cadet                     ----
E2      Police Officer            Detective
E3*     Corporal                  ----
E4      Sergeant                  Detective Sergeant/Investigator
O1      Lieutenant                Lieutenant
O2      Captain                   Captain
O3*     Deputy Inspector          Deputy Inspector
O4      Inspector                 Inspector
O5*     Assistant Chief           Assistant Chief
O6*     Deputy Chief              Deputy Chief
O7*     Chief of Bureau           Chief of Detectives
O8      Chief of Department       ----
O9*     Commissioner              ----

Ranks O3 and above are generally considered political appointments
from within the ranks in large departments.

Small departments never have Cadets (rank E1) and generally omit
ranks E3, O5, O6, and O7; rank O3 may or may not exist.  If ranks
O5, O6, and O7 are _all_ omitted, rank O8 is called simply "Chief".
Some large departments omit ranks E1 and E3. A department that has
rank E1 will also have a Police Academy of its own; a Cadet will be
a prospective Police Officer in the final phase of his/her
training, or, in the largest police departments, may be a college
student who is on a work-study program with a major field of study
of Law Enforcement or Criminal Justice.

Small departments never have Commissioners (rank O9). Large
departments may or may not; if a Commissioner exists, it is as a
civilian political appointee setting overall policy, not involved
in operational matters.

UMOS are civil service employees until they achieve rank O3.  As
such, officers must have come up through the ranks.  Do not roll
for Commission.  Promotion should be rolled for regardless of SOC
and world government if current rank is below O2, with a +1 DM for
each _2_ terms served (count the current term) in addition to the
stated DMs and no SOC benefit.  Term DMs are no longer added once a
character achieves rank O2, but at that time, the SOC benefit _is_
added.  Thus, a player with SOC 9 who achieves rank O2 in his 5th
term did so with a +2 DM on the promotion roll in addition to any
DM for CON, but no SOC DM is given, even on Low Gov worlds.  In
subsequent terms, the character has a +2 DM for time-in-service,
_and_ a +1 DM for SOC 8+, for a total DM of +3.  The automatic
promotion on Gov High+ worlds applies once a character is attempting
to promote beyond rank O2.

All characters enter the career as rank E2.  Time spent as E1 in
departments that use this rank is covered by initial training and
possibly Undergraduate University as well.

Characters may leave the career and then choose to come back.  If
a character had rank O2 or below at the time of departure, roll 2D6
for the total number of terms in _all_ careers up to this point.
the result is _greater_than_ the number of terms served in all
careers, the character may re-enter with no loss of rank.  If the
result is _less_than_or_equal_to_ the number of terms served in
all careers, one level of rank is lost for _each_ term _not_ served
in Law Enforcement.  If the character had rank O3 or above at the
time of departure, roll 2D6 for 10+, DM +1 for SOC 8+, DM +1 for
each _2_ terms served in Law Enforcement.  If the roll succeeds,
the character is reappointed with no loss of rank.  If the roll
fails, the character may not return to Law Enforcement.

SKILL PACKAGES

Small departments:  The supplied skill packages in the basic rules
are OK as written.  However, the "Detective" skill package is not
used for being "commissioned".  Instead, roll 1D6 for assignment
each term; on 1, the special assignment is "Staff", on 2, the
special assignment is "Detective".  On any other roll, the
character is a uniformed officer.  If the assignment is
"Detective", use the Detective skill package instead of the
Uniformed skill package; if the assignment is "Staff", the
skill package consists of Vehicle, Interaction, Charm, Language,
Perception, Economics, Social Science.  On "Staff" assignments, the
character gets one Government and one Law Enforcement contact
instead of one Criminal and one Law Enforcement contact in that
term.

In large departments, roll 1D6 each term for bureau assignment:
1 - Patrol Service, 2 - Detective Service, 3 - Internal Affairs,
4 - Information Systems, 5 - Physical Plant, 6 - Quartermaster.  If
the bureau assignment is Patrol or Detective, roll 1D6 for
assignment; on 1 or 2, the character has been assigned to "Staff"
and gets the staff skill package above.  Otherwise, Patrol
assignees use the uniformed skill package; Detective assignees use
the Detective skill set.  For other assignments, use the following
skill packages:

Internal Affairs - Determination, Charm, Interaction, Perception,
Vehicle, Economics, Social Science.

Information Systems - Economics, Technician, Interaction, Charm,
Perception.  Contacts as "Staff", above.

Physical Plant - Engineer, Artisan, Construction, Technician,
Vehicle, Economics.  Contacts as "Staff", above.

Quartermaster - Charm, Determination, Interaction, Vehicle,
Economics.  Contacts as "Staff", above.

     I believe, and others may confirm or argue against this, that straight 
     nukes are not used in space because vaccuum is a poor medium for 
     transfer of energy.  Nuclear explosions are powerful within atmosphere 
     because they burn up the atmosphere of our world, creating the 
     fireball and huge mushroom-cloud effect.
     
     In space, Traveller\'s means of transferring the immense nuclear energy 
     is via laser rods that channel the force of a nuclear explosion into 
     several laser shots that can potentially devastate a ship\'s hull.

       ##    meet women of the former USSR through romance ads    ##

     Months ago, Olga Kosmina placed my personal ad in several papers of the
former Soviet Union.  Since that time I have received over 40 responses for
the $50 I mailed Olga.  (I believe she paid the newspapers something around 
$35 and kept the rest for her efforts.)
     I have found greater success and savings by placing my own personal 
romance advertisement rather than purchasing addresses through Russian
"bride"
catalog companies.
     If you are interested in placing a personal romance ad as I did, contact
Olga.  She has built up a list of most every newspaper and magazine in the 
former Soviet Union and could help direct your ad to certain areas if you 
wish.  She writes, "please say that I place all ad _throughout_ Russia and 
other countries of former Soviet Union, not only Western Russia."
     Olga is 23 years old, has a bachelors in biology and works full-time as
a
florist in Kiev.  She speaks, reads and writes English as well as her native 
languages of Russian and Ukrainian.
     I realize that it is a very trusting person who would put $ into an 
envelope and mail to a foreign country.  If you would rather send a letter of

inquiry first, Olga will respond to your questions.  It takes about 16 days 
for a letter to travel from the USA to Kiev.

Olga Kozmina
Dekabristov Street 5 - 178
Kiev 253121
Ukraine

     I have found that by placing a single bill between two pieces of 
newsprint inside an envelope, the Ukrainian post cannot see through and does 
not bother to tamper.  I have yet to lose a letter sent to Kiev.  I am sorry 
that Olga does not have e-mail because it would make contact with her much 
easier.
     I am posting anonymously because of the inordinate amount of e-mail
which
 I would receive -- inquiries as well as flames.

Best Wishes,

David and Olga

     Although Olga has never seen a newsgroup nor heard of "net-etiquette," 
she believes that helping others exceeds the cost of angering those who feel 
the net should not be used in this fashion.
     IHA (I humbly ask) that you not flame the postmaster of this site.

They are not PC(politically correct).  
It seems to me we have a rather large nuke going off all the time we call it
the sun.  It effects can be felt through our atmosphere and the radiation can
be a hazard.  At one time it was thought that to have the recoil from a gun
it needed the air to push against, it was proven that wasn\'t so.  
As for the volume of space involved give them a hit number and damage based
on the yield.  If one gets through your opponent would be sure to try and
kill every missile you launch.  Even a small nuke would cause a lot of damage
IF it contacts a ship.

They decided apriori that nothing else could makle a fire solution, then
later
that while a fire solution for kinetic energy or nuke missiles *was*
possible,
they would *all* be shot down before they reached their targets since they
would be moving in a perfectly predicible way (amazingly, even totally
*unarmed*
ships can do this!).

Well, while the det-laser weapons should have a better shot at hitting, there
is no rational reason why you couldn\'t get a nuke close enough to, well, nuke
the other guy (if you can board, why can\'t you nuke?).  On the other hand, at
BL/BR velocities a nuke is redundant compared to the KE of the empty
missile----
not to mention the fact that dampers will stop a nuke.

That\'s the way the rules are.  You\'ll have to use a house-rule (I *just*

What about unarmed, or damaged ships that can\'t shoot *anything*, much less a
couple hundred missiles?

If they wanted no contact missiles they should have written the rules so that
if you made one, then played it in BL it would never hit.  Instead they
decided
it would never hit, and told you you couldn\'t make one.

I guess the simple fix is to say that any ship that could be boarded, or any
unarmed ship at all that is hit by a contact missile is destroyed (not too
far
from the truth, actually----regardless of the ships size).  The only problem
is
that the rules as they stand say that any armed ship can destroy an
*infinite*
number of simultaneous missile attacks (who said that old scout-courier was
weak! :)

Too blo*dy right. Anyone out there an investigative journalist? Does Roger
Cook subscribe to trav/xboat? :-)

Does anyone know how to get this guy? I believe there are ways of
back-tracking these supposedly anonymous postings (using the message ID?).

This sort of random cross-posting severely pisses me off, especially given
that there must be genuine "news" posting areas for this sort of sad cr*p.

Drake Light Assault Vehicle, which I posted earlier.
There were several minor (and couple of not so minor)
flaws in the previous posting.
Those who bothered to read through my earlier posting,
and through my rantings with the turrets, well, I
myself have decided to use a bit different multiplier
for the volume in the turrets of vehicles. I will go
to this change in a bit, but if you do not want to
use the system, reduce the cargo in this design
to 0.3 tons.

Now, after short tampering with the turrets, I noticed
that by dividing the suggested multiplier from FFS
by 10, and then adding 1 to it, will give a much better
(read realistic) affect to the turret volume. Putting
stuff in the turret still has an effect, but now you
actually can design turreted vehicles without them
having to be 10 displacement tons or more in size.
If this will bring the volume of the turret equipment
too much down for your taste, try using 5 as the divider
instead of the 10 I use, that increases the effect
of tech level with the turrets, but keeps the turrets
manageable.

Now, without any further delay, back to the corrected...

The expanded legal profile has the structure O-WTRVP, where

freedom. The O entry is the world law level, the others are generated
as 2d-7+(UWP gov code). (This only works for the standard human gov
codes, I suppose.) Low numbers=less legal restriction.

The expanded tech profile is CC-GGGGG-TTTT-MM-N, where
C=common, G=general, T=transport, M=military, N=novelty. More
specifically: 

C1=high common, C2=low common
G1=energy, G2=computers/robotics, G3=communications, G4=medical,
G5=environment
T1=land transport, T2=water, T3=air, T4=space
M1=personal military, M2=heavy military

The expanded tech generation sequence is more complicated than the
legal, so I\'m not going to try duplicating it here.

        Looks like the old DGP World Builder\'s Handbook. Legal profile, in 
order, consists of Overall (4), Weapons (0), Trade (3), Criminal Law (5),
Civil 
Law (2), and Personal Freedom (0). So it looks to me like they\'ve got a very 
stringent criminal law system, some trade and civil laws, and wide open
weapons 
and personal freedom.

        Tech level profile, in order: High Common (F), Low Common (E), Energy

(F), Computers/Robotics (F), Communications (F), Medical (G), Environment
(E), 
Land Transport (F), Water Transport (F), Air Transport (F), Space Transport
(F), 
Personal Military (G), Heavy Military (F), and Novelty (H). If I needed
medical 
help or wanted some kick-ass personal weapons and armor, this is where I\'d
want 
to go.

        Hope this helps. If you need more explanations of the categories,
let me 
know.

Well, here\'s another question that I hope someone can help me with. 
What do I do if I want to create powered melee weapons?  I want to
create batons that pack an electrical `punch\' for some characters I\'m
working on, but I have no idea where to start off.  Unless I am missing
something, there aren\'t any such weapons in any of the TNE materials so
I don\'t have anything to base my designs on.  Any pointers from anyone?

Also, since I haven\'t gotten any response to the following questions, I
thought I\'d repost them just in case they slipped through the cracks
the first time.

This one is primarily for Loren or Dave (or anyone else that may know
the answer).  I\'m thinking about converting some old MT designs using
FFS.  Now my question comes from looking at the conversions done on the
Moraine and Beowulf-class free traders.  Looking at them, they have
twice the number of passenger staterooms as what their MT counterpart
did.  Why is this?  Is there any particular reason that the extra rooms
were added and that cargo space taken up?  I\'m just looking to see if
there was any specific design philosophy for converting to TNE that I
may be missing.

And lastly, does anyone know what the rules are for not having enough
people to crew a ship?  I can\'t find them anywhere in the TNE rulebook.
Am I missing something really obvious here, or is this an oversite?

Someone, please help me out!  Thanks in advance.

   Fifteen of these were from women mistakenly placed on the

women who could only be classified as Coyote Ugly (tm), five from
women wanted on charges of killing their husands looking to escape

pretending to be women looking for someone stupid enough to mail
them an airline ticket to Berlin so that they can do some shopping.

   More like she paid the newspaper the equivalent of five dollars (around
3.4 billion rubles) and took her boyfriend out on the town with the rest.

   After all, why go to all the trouble of getting a slick catalogue full of
women hired out by a modelling agency which in no way resemble the
women you will correspond with, when you can get your rejection
and fleecing direct from the source and have nothing to show for it.

   She wants to take her boyfriend out on the town again.

   After all, you don\'t why should you get taken by women in one former
Soviet republic when there are so many?  I\'m feeling up for rejection from
Uzbekistan myself.

   By the way, I can get you such a list for less than $50, or you can go
to your public library (preferably a large branch) and get it for free.
Then again, I\'d like to take myself out on the town so if....

>She writes, "please say that I place all ad _throughout_ Russia and
>other countries of former Soviet Union, not only Western Russia."

   A true Ukrainian would never refer to Ukraine as "Western Russia"--
that would be an insult.  We\'ll cut Dave here some slack and assume
that his girlfriend (or so he thinks) Olga is of Russian descent, and that
Joe Stalin "suggested" that her grandpappy or great grandpappy move
west after WW II.

   She also has an unemployed boyfriend who never takes her
anywhere which is why she needs the money to take him out on the
town.

   Or a fool.  You figure out which one you are if you respond.

   Got to love the efficency of the Ukrainian Secret Police.  It would
have taken the old KGB at least a month to go through your letter looking
for secret spy messages.

   Now that you\'ve revealed your secret Dave, any bets on whether

   Now that you\'ve given us her home address, I\'m sure one of us with
a friend we can e-mail in Kiev will arrange something just as special 
(and more personal) as flame mail to leave on her doorstep.  An \'I Love
Afghanistan\' bumper sticker plastered on the door should go over very
well with the neighbors.

   My guess is that the ratio of flame to inquiry would be something
like 5,000,000,000 to 1 (I\'m not precluding the possibility that someone
might take you seriously).  No doubt some of us would have had some
*really* special things to say to you were you not so much of a
*coward*.  No doubt you have trouble getting dates in the US because 
of your total lack of anything resembling gonads.

   Let me get this straight, Dave.  You post someone\'s name and home
address on the Internet (at this site and God knows where else) without
telling them what the full implications might be?  Not only are you
ball-less, but apparently brainless as well (or maybe Olga is...I doubt
anyone who understood what you were going to do would have
consented to it).  Maybe you\'re just trying to get back at Olga for p----ing
away your money on her boyfriend.

>     IHA (I humbly ask) that you not flame the postmaster of this site.

   We will do no such thing.  If anything we will stand in support of him
and ask that he take all steps possible to find out who you really are
so that we may let you know what we think of you for wasting our
time with your apparent attempt at international wire fraud.

Things have been a bit slow at work this week.  In a fit of
silliness, I began trying to sketch out a Traveller adventure based
on this mailing.  If I can get it anywhere near useable, I will
post a summary of it later this week.

How the H*ll did this twit David get the mailing list address anyway?

     Yeah, but if only I _had_ a copy of WBH.  Used to have one.  Sold it 
     like a fool when I thought I was getting out of Traveller.  Now I\'m

     I fully intend to.  My current campaign is moving from Deneb Sector to 
     The Spinward Marches and I plan to write up several worlds, including 
     Rhylanor, Porozlo, Efate and perhaps Jae Tellona.  Using old TNS clips 
     and information from Classic Trav adventures, I\'m hoping I can put 
     together some pretty good stuff.

    'body' => 'Inspired by the recent re-discussion of contact nuclear weapons, I did a
brief calculation of the damage value of nuclear weapons.

I took a 1 MT weapon, which according to the sci.astro FAQ is 4.2*10^9 MJ,
and assumed that all of that energy would be available in an attack.

I calculated that flux in MJ/cm^2 at various ranges, and took that as the
intensity in the formula for laser DV.

My results

Range  (m)       DV
  1              457
 10               45
 50                9
100                4

It is clear from this that a nuke can really only be effective in a true
"contact" situation.  

To complete a sequence for nuke warheads, you would have to (1) decide on
some more resonable efficiency (2) find out or decide the proportion of the
explosion resulting in a thermal/emp pulse (a "laser" attack) and the
proportion dedicated to accelerating the remaining matter of the missile (a
particle accelerator attack) and (3) work out penetration and additional
damage rules from there.

Whatever rules are used for space combat, this should at least provide some
damage guidelines for a sabotage or suicide bomber situation (isn\'t that
shuttle getting a little bit close?)

This is one of the sources of inspiration.  However, I just can\'t find
any sort of rule for what to do.  I can\'t believe that over the past 17
years, no one at GDW has thought of making local law enforcement
officials with stun batons (or criminals for that matter).  It seems as
though the combat rules are either `shoot it with a bullet and let it
bleed\' or `hit it with fusion/plasma weapons and watch the blunt trauma
add up.\'  Not that I don\'t like these forms of combat, I\'m just
wondering what I should do for electrical weapons, etc.

Anyway, since my original post, I\'ve been mulling some ideas over in my
head, and I was wondering if anyone could give me an opinion on them.

I figured that I would treat charged melee weapons as energy weapons
for terms of damage.  So, a character would make a successful melee
hit, and then the hit character would suffer the damage from the
weapon, plus the energy damage.\'

And then, as for designing the weapons, all I could think of was using
the rules for handheld laser weapons and batteries.  You know, design a
battery with a certain amount of power output.  Make sure it\'s not too
big (for a hand-held weapon without a backpack).  Use the laser rules
to determine damage (with no beam pointer, or muzzle, etc, I think all
that it leaves is converting raw Mj\'s to physical damage).

So, one could probably design a crowd control melee weapon that causes
+1-2 points in damage for electrical damage using something like 125
hits (for a scaled TL15 battery), or more damage for less hits in a
hard-core combat/life or death situation.

Now, since I\'m anything but a good scientist, could anyone out there
with a really good understand of this stuff please tell me if I\'m
anywhere on the right track?

And I guess that no one has any idea what the penalties are for not
having enough crew members on a ship?  Damn, and I thought I was the
only one not getting it.

Thanks in advance...

   The general consensus is that the appearance of contragrav at TL 9,
and HEPlaR at TL 10 renders most forms of ground transportation
obsolete--so much so that a TL 12 ground car is almost unheard of
(unless you\'re a nostalgia buff who wonders what it would be like to
cruise a highway and have to parallel park).  Development of walker
type vehicles also comes to a grinding halt.  Though there is some
development in this field after TL 10, the results are specialty vehicles
which operate on worlds where contragrav units have difficulty
safely maneuvering because of weather patterns (high winds would
undoubtedly wreak serious havoc on a slow moving contragrav
transport, not to mention what it would do to the passengers stomachs)
or other factors.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                    
   But what if contragrav weren\'t available on a world until later on, say
TL 14 or 15 (or was never developed)?  After all, we Terrans aren\'t
even close yet and we have achieved TL 8 in many areas.  Wouldn\'t
there be some worlds that chose to develop walker vehicles to their
technological conclusion (whatever that may be)?  And what about
worlds where walkers were developed, and later contragrav was
introduced?  Would they abandon their walker vehicles immediately, or
would there be a transitionary period where walkers were retrofitted
with contragrav?
                                                                                                                    
   With this background in mind, I pose some questions that I\'ve been
pondering lately....                                                                                       
                                                                                                                     
1)  Would improved walker suspensions and transmissions be 
developed beyond those currently available in FF&S?                               
                                                                                                                     
2)  What would the effects of installing a contragrav unit into a walker
be?  Would this enable the walker to leap into the air?  If so, how
high?  What if the contragrav unit fails during a leap?  How much
damage would be done to the vehicle?  What would be the maximum
height a vehicle can leap into the air?  What would be the maximum rate
of ascent and descent?                                                                              
                                                                                                                     
3)  Would installing contragrav improve the speed of the vehicle
(after all, with contragrav on, it doesn\'t weigh nearly as much)?  If so,
what kind of penalties would have to paid by a vehicle that was running
a maximum speed and tried to stop too fast?                                              
                                                                                                                     
3)  Given that contragrav would make walkers "lighter on their feet",
could a walker now perform martial arts type moves (even something
as simple as a good old front kick)?  If so, how much damage would
this cause (both to the target and the walker)?                                          
                                                                                                                    
4)  How much would walker vehicles benefit from advances in
the field of Cybernetics?  Would including cybernetic devices allow a
walker to move more naturally and efficiently?                                           
                                                                                                                     
   I have my opinions on what the answers to these questions are, but
I am looking for feedback from others.  I hope that a consensus can be

Stun batons...  

Well, your original question about "powered melee weapons"
put me in mind of weapons with small jets in the haft or gyros for balance,
in the spirit of several neat short stories from _Body Armor: 2000_ (edited
I believe by Joe Haldeman).  But now that I know what you mean...  you want
a glorified cattle prod...

The concept is simple:  high voltage, low amps at about the frequency used
by the central nervous system of humans (most of us, there\'s a Rodney King
in every crowd, though...).  This causes temporary stun effects.  There is
really no need for "design rules" per se.  Choose your battery size, a
comfortable weight for balance (usually mostly transformer and contact
points) add a switch (some have safeties) and Whammo!  (My stunners use
either one or two 9-volt batteries, and generate (depending on model)
anywhere from 40,000 to 120,000 volts in the microamp range.  I think the
human CNS runs at about 30 hertz.  A doctor can correct me if I\'m wrong,
but being a couple of hertz off can make the attack relatively impotent.
Some drugs, like PCP (Rodney King), or was it cocaine?, can increase the
running freq of the CNS, and some people have a naturally higher freq than
others; it hasn\'t been investigated, but some theorize that this is one
factor that allows some to function better under stress or move more quickly
physically or mentally than others...  In Traveller, different minor races
may require different electrical stun weapon freqs...  A geonee may not be
downed by a Vilani stunner, or an Ithklur affected by ANY human frequency
weapons.  These weapons will be quickly supplanted, I am sure, at higher
tech levels by neural weapons, which may or may not incur similar limitations
based on race.

The trick is there is NO permanent damage (well, normally...) for short
term exposure.  I would implement CON checks, added chances for stun (like
those for concussion explosion attacks), or maybe us a single wound category,
the head, for the addition of multiple attacks to eventually disable the
target.  The effects wear off in about 30 minutes.  Long term exposure to
high voltages, even at low amps, may cause nerve damage, but make great
torture weapons (point in case- zap gloves used to great effect in _Voice
of the Whirlwind_ by Walter Jon Williams, which also had a great MONO-
FILAMENT WHIP in it...  but that\'s for another time.)  However, if you
up the amperage all kinds of hell would get played with the target.  I
guess your laser analogy would be the best for electrocution, but remember
there will be damage at two body points, the contact point, and the point
where the body is grounded, usually a foot, but not always...  I\'ve seen
some nasty death scene photos of autoerotic deaths where these demented
folks used model train transformers to, well, you figure it out...  It 
would be VERY hard to have power in the MW range while maintaining microamp 
performance in the human CNS freq range, and very unnecessary if your aim 
is only to incapacitate.  If your intent is too kill, other means would be 
more efficient.  Kinetic energy comes to mind.

One hazard comes about because of the weapon\'s dependance on natural skin
resistance.  Skin is a high Ohm material, blood is not, water is not
(especially when ionized nicely by ferrous compounds - can you say
"hemoglobin"?  I can; it\'s pronounced C-O-N-D-U-C-T-O-R.).  If the skin
is pierced, which may happen in a stressful encounter (arrest or combat) 
if your contacts are too long (or deliberately sharpened, which no legit
law enforcement officer would do, honest.  :-) ), the heart will decide 
to stop functioning.  Oops.  Also wet skin can also cause an arcing 
effect to the blood stream similarly.  On a side note, that\'s why hospital 
telephones (which may be used by persons having a direct conduit to their 
bloodstream - IV) have to be specially insulated against accidental 
discharges which your home phone probably gives off once in a while, and 
you never notice...  Sounds like a great murder plot device on a low tech
world, like Earth, 1995 AD, where wet, barefoot women are still electrocuted
by hotel door room card readers that are in cahoots with room air cond-
itioners...

The stunner will not normally affect the user, even when the user is in
contact with the target, but if you\'re both wet...  :-)  As they say,
"Don\'t light a match..."

Which reminds me, for some unknown reason, about the Taser.  about 20 meters
of monofilament cable, twin darts fired by .22 caliber shells, 40,000 volts,
and you have Rodney King...  or don\'t you?  Hit him with them twice, they
did, and he laughed...  Scary stuff that \'angel dust\'...  My advice to
potential Traveller law enforcement personnel is "Don\'t give up your batons,
and get some cayenne pepper spray... (which incidentally doesn\'t work on
some other people... mostly cajuns)"

I guess I\'ve pontificated about stunners enough.

Harold, you might want to lift an idea from GURPS Robots
and envision some walkers as "robots with a human (or other 
sapient being) command/control system".  For one thing this
would help bridge the gap between battledress and walking
vehicles.  Compare large robots made from VAMPIRE FLEETS
with small walker vehicles. I haven\'t done it myself yet, so I 
couldn\'t tell you what you might find, but it\'s worth checking.

Inevitably.  Check for a trend in developement that could continue

Yes.

The main considerations would be the power to the drive train (and

There\'s no falling/collision damage rules anyplace? Hmmm...

 If you are trying to increase the lethality of melee weapons, this
works fine. I would probably look up the (altogether too brief) rules
on neural weapons from MegaTrav, mesh them with the Tranq rules from
TNE, and use the result: Normal melee damage for the weapon form, plus
a CON task based on the strength of the charge. The results of the CON
task would vary from no effect thru a "lose an action" and "lose the whole
turn" to unconsciousness and possible death (unlikely, since a weapon
with that much charge is very dangerous to use in _non_ combat situations).


>And then, as for designing the weapons, all I could think of was using

 Looks reasonable, but I would consider boiling down the "damage" into
a toughness rating for the above CON task, instead of figuring a die
rating.

 A couple spring to mind immediately: Maintenance points/hours equal
man-hours required to keep a ship in top condition. Feel free to
impose wear values on whatever the players decide not to maintain <EG>.
Also, because Imperials are trained to specific bridge positions, you
can impose stress modifiers to all tasks performed in a second bridge
position by one person. Only Scouts don\'t have this problem, as they
often have one guy doing ALL of the bridge jobs, making their training
much more multi-task friendly.

Assuming that you are designing at TL12, there are several possibilities for 
these sorts of weapons. You don\'t say what sort of \'punch\' you want, but a 
non-lethal shock could be delivered very easily considering batteries and HPGs 
at TL12. I don\'t have exact figures for this, but I think that a lethal shock 
becomes possible with voltages of 50-100V, depending on where the current is 
applied, so even less than this would be needed. By TL12, this could probably be 
fitted into almost anything, a glove for city gangs, or a fake pen for covert 
agents. I expect someone to correct me, as I haven\'t done any calculations, but 
I reckon that the components of the system would have such a very low cost, that 
the price you give it probably would be determined more by how commonly 
available you want the devices to be. For effects, I suggest using the 
description for tranquiliser rounds as a guideline. It would penetrate any 
low-tech non-metal armour covering the location (ballistic cloth, etc), but 
metal suits of armour (which act as a faraday cage) and probably combat armour / 
battle dress (superdense is a metal) would provide complete protection.

All this assumes that your players are altruistic, peaceful souls, looking for a 
non-lethal melee weapon with which they can subdue those poor, misguided people 
who have taken it upon themselves to kill them. <ahem> If they aren\'t, then a 
lethal version would be equally possible. Considering power storage and 
discharge available, it seems to me that it would be very easy to produce 
extremely lethal melee shock weapons, which would effectively kill on contact 
(again, anyone with more experience of electrics, feel free to contradict), 
although you would need to be careful of the discharge arcing to unwanted 
targets, or even the firer. Combine a shock weapon with some sort of high tech 
blade, and you have a weapon which would be illegal on almost all worlds. 
If these weapons became very common, then a common piece of cybertech would be a 
network of thin superconducting wires implanted under the skin, which would 
protect against any hits from shock weapons (nasty surface burns, though).

has a length to width ratio of about 1:7. I did some rough calculations for a 
1:20 ratio hull (which I had to tweak to be more material efficient than the 
cylinder I modelled it with. This brings it into line with the conventional 
needle which is much more material efficient than a cylinder of the same length

Compared to a conventional needle it would have about 30% less armour, which 
seems a reasonable trade-off for more than doubling meson gun range.

Notes:
- It seems to make Open frame craft almost obsolete, except in price terms, this 
needs to be looked at, and is a product of a mathematical approach, instead of 
any conscious attempt. 
- From the front arc the profile of the ship is so small that it might be 
considered one target size smaller for sensor and/or fire purposes.
-It is only really suitable for 100 ton+ craft as otherwise the needle is so 
narrow that the space would not be useable for conventional ships sytems.

I think that this would need further adjustment before it could be used 
properly. Simply for the sake of game balance an MVM of around 2.1-2.2 would 
seem better and it might not be easier to streamline than a needle, as I have 
assumed. What does everyone else think?

Sounds about right. My only knowledge is from a Roger Cook investigative
program probing the manufacture and sale of such stuff from UK factories for
use as crowd control and torture in (mainly) the middle east, but also
China, South America, etc. Apparently applying them to the soles of your
victim\'s feet is very effective.

They were showing 40cm-100cm batons with two electrodes sticking out one
end. Press el buttono and watch the sparks. Values of c.40,000V were
mentioned but various models have less or more. I think they had an internal
battery pack and would store 100-200 charges. They also showed police riot
shields (from \'bucklers\' up to 1.5m x 0.5m with electrodes running over most
of the surface - these had much the same number of charges and were able to
(I think) stun or KO an opponent with each shock. Remember though its the
volts that shock but the amps that kill (otherwise Van De Graaf generators
would have been banned in schools years ago!) so I guess for a really
efficient stick/shield you need high tech batteries or a low tech larger
battery pack. And don\'t forget the common-garden taser (both the touch
version and the fire a dart on a wire version). I think high tech armour
(whole-suit stuff from CE suits up) might already have protection against
shock attack, perhaps by using a conductive outer surface which bleeds the
charge to ground? Certainly robots would be protected. But if you can put in
enough amps you can probably still burn through, etc.

NOT ENOUGH CREW?

>And I guess that no one has any idea what the penalties are for not

No official rules that I know of, but suggestions are:
(1) Ship operations take longer - this may be hazardous when under attack, 
suffering major faults anywhere, trying complex manoeuvres, etc. It
increases the time taken to dock and perform port operations (loading cargo,
etc.). This can be compensated by hiring dock workers, but this increases costs.
(2) Ship may not pass safety inspections (increase difficulty).
(3) Ship may have more service problems (insufficient maintenance is done) -
[make sure you have enough jump drive engineers!]
(4) Insufficient stewards - you get ratty passengers vid-phoning the captain
all night because he\'s the obvious link when they can\'t find the stewards.
(5) Insufficient services - crew morale drops when the sole chef is doing
the work of three men and either has insufficient food, or it\'s the same
burgers and beans for the 9th day running...

Then Harold Hale asks about...

CONTRAGRAV - TO BE OR NOT TO BE...
                                     
>   The general consensus is that the appearance of contragrav at TL 9,

Ha ha. Yes, I know it\'s "in the rules" but as you point out, we\'re a bit far
from gravitics at the moment. We can\'t even make a decent fusion reactor -
hot or cold... :-)

The easiest way to play this to maintain rough consistency with \'canon\' is
to say that gravitic devices at TL9 are huge and power hungry. Okay, so very
expensive grav tanks might be worth it, but only the most expensive limo\'s
will have grav. Common people\'s grav cars will still be more expensive (10 x
or greater) than ground cars at _any_ TL (IMHO). They are also far more
hazardous to drive, given that both grav and ground cars can be advanced in
the same manner (automated control and routing, auto collision avoidance,
traffic-sensing and rerouting, GPS-type navigation, etc.) but grav vehicles
are airborne, giving much more complex requirements for airspace control,
more expensive requirements for vehicle sensors (terrain-following radar,
all-round radar, weather-sensing, etc.) and associated instrumentation,
greater sensitivity to weather (high winds, electrical storms, fog, mist,
low clouds, smoke), greater opportunity for pilot error (an extra dimension
- up/down - to keep track of), much greater danger in event of a fault or
crash (okay, so some cars may crash off a road into a building, but a grav
vehicle might dive into a school from hundreds of metres or even km up -
mass murder or what?). Anyone driving grav will be paying much greater
insurance premiums and probably requiring more power to keep the vehicle
going (hence greater running costs). Grav modules are probably more complex
than ground car engines hence more expensive to maintain (further running
costs).

Many people can\'t drive a simple ground car properly. I wouldn\'t let 99% of
them _near_ a grav vehicle. If they can\'t even manage to lift one finger and
indicate when turning at a junction, how the hell is anyone going to know
where they\'re going in three dimensions?!?!?!?!

You betcha. Better lubricants, mechanical design, harder-wearing materials,
etc.

Makes it almost as dangerous as a grav vehicle.

That would soon be discovered by the \'boy racers\' in the community.

Hi, this is Naremi Landrau for StellarLink News. Police have been unable to
ascertain why Michael Airhead and Tom Noballs tried to jump their new
Strider LandWalker 20T over the school building, but their deaths seem
little compensation for the resulting carnage which has taken the lives of
twenty seven pupils and two teachers...


>3)  Would installing contragrav improve the speed of the vehicle
>(after all, with contragrav on, it doesn\'t weigh nearly as much)?

I don\'t think so. By definition I would assume a walker requires friction
with the ground to push itself forward. Turn on contragrav and you might
find that pushing against the ground causes the walker to tumble rather than

Easy solution - ignore the physics, build a test vehicle, and get Airhead

How about: It doesn\'t stop... or it tumbles... sounds like another item to
add to the test plan for A & N \'crash dummies\'.

See tumble possibility above. This would depend on how fast the mechanics
allow the legs to move. One machine bashing another doesn\'t achieve any more
than one martial artist bashing another - unless there are specific weak
points to attack (and you have the flexibility to reach them - which I doubt
in a large walker vehicle) then neither side can really hurt the other.

I would assume yes, since cyber devices must adapt to their host and control
muscles, etc. efficiently given feedback on the limb status and a training
session of how to walk, etc. The same technology (upsized for walkers) would
be applicable and would probably be standard on higher tech walkers.

You\'re forgetting the snub pistol/tranq round combination that dates back

   It looks like this fellow was doing a blanket mailing to a large
   number of internet mailing lists.  I read Olga\'s "offer" on 4 or 5 lists,
   and noticed that there were a large number of other lists in the 
   visible part of the "to" fields.  Some fellow downloaded some kind of
   "list of lists" on the internet and then sent his nonsense out.  I doubt
   very much he\'s ever read even 1% of the lists he "spammed"

   I\'d be curious to see what kind of adventure you came up with based on
   this silliness.

	This is correct, and probably why nukes aren\'t used much.  Most of 
the damage from a nuclear blast on a planetary surface is due to: a) 
the pressure wave from the blast...something that obviously doesn\'t 
happen in a vaccuum environment, and b) the superheated air from the 
blast setting fires.  The common factor in most of the effects is the 
presence of an atmosphere as a medium for transmitting the energy of 
the blast.  In vaccum, only radiatation damage can occur.  The 
localized plasma around the blast will be extremely hot, but quite 
thin by atmospheric standards. thus the amount of energy it can 
transmit will be much smaller.

	Of course, the radiation effects will be greater in a vaccum (all 
that energy\'s gotta go <somewhere>) so there will be a LOT of very 
high energy radiation in all directions, spread all across the 
spectrum.  So a shiny or white surface 
will be able reflect a lot of the energy back, and the armor should 
easily handle the rest, it had better...your average solar flare is 
going to put out energy on the order of a nuke going off nearby, and 
do it for days to a week at a time.  I don\'t think that nukes put out 
the high energy particles like solar flares, it\'s mostly photons 
(very high energy photons, to be sure, but photons nonetheless).

	Meanwhile, a nuke driven laser is going to channel a fair amount of 
that energy at a single (or very small number) wavelength, at a 
single spot...the main aim of weapons since Grog picked up that first 
rock and threw it at something.

	My question is: why not have multiple independently aimed lasers 
from each blast...this, after all, was the real life design that was 
proposed with the nuke pumped lasers that they were talking about in 
the Star Wars program (no not the movie, but that giant Reagan era 
cash sucker program)

Very true.  I would guess that at the very close ranges (<10m - real
contact) the thermal/radiation pulse would do so much damage so quickly that
you would get a shock wave/superheated plasma travelling through the hull as
a result of large scale vaporizion of its material.

Its worth noting that, even in an atmosphere, anything you can protect from
the shock wave needs quite a close hit -- provided you didn\'t want to walk
around outside it for a few decades.  Even then, I think the plans to crack
silo\'s depended mostly on overpressure.  The WWII Axis battleships used for
testing survived the experience with only surface damage (but were quite
unusable due to radiation).

Question -- do we assume TL 12 decontam capabilities are substantially
better than ours, or could you render a target long-term hot with an
appropriate weapon?

My guess: they do, but you use the targetting to play the odds on where the
target will be in 1/10 of a second when your beam gets there from 30,000 km.
An optional rule might allow you to trade hit prob for damage.

I read somewhere that the nukes designed for transatmospheric ABM use in the

One major factor is cost of vehicle. I don\'t have TNE handy, but I do
remember when an air/raft (the SIMPLEST/CHEAPEST c-v vehicle) cost
Cr 400,000!

This is more than a Mac truck! - and way out of range of Airhead and

This would produce something similar to the system used in Battletech (from FASA I 
think..) There you use a neural helmet which gives you feedback on the mech\'s (that\'s 
walker in Battletech) position and balance (where the arms/legs etc are in space). 
This makes the mech feel like an extension of the pilot\'s body (albeit quite a bit larger :-)
so he has much better control.

Hmmm, might be interesting to design a walker like this....

Probably, nuclear dampers are normally used to make atomic nuclei more stable, 
but this would be no good for decontamination (It would make for good radiation 
shielding for personnel and vehicles though). In the FFS description of nuclear 
dampers though, it says they can also make nuclei more unstable. Using a damper, 
the decay period could be cut down to a few days (not too fast, or the whole 
area would resemble a nuclear reactor core). I assume that the damper can\'t 
affect stable nuclei, otherwise it would be used as a weapon to disintegrate 
enemy hulls, so they would be unaffected by the decontamination.

As contact nuclear explosions are extremely nasty, and it is very difficult to 
get your missiles to hit your opponent, why not use a high powered (long range) 
nuclear damper to detonate their own missiles while they are inside their ships? 
The problems with this are significant, but not insurmountable.

- At range, hitting a missile warhead, an even smaller target than the missile 
would be very hard. The effective target size for attacks would be determined by 
the number of missiles carried by the target.
 
- Nuclear dampers as designed in FFS are pulse shot weapons, not constant beams, 
as the striker rules additions show. This means that the target ship would find 
it very difficult to protect against damper attacks by using dampers to store 
their missiles. Maybe \'freezer\' boxes for warheads are still possible under FFS, 
despite Striker contradicting this. However, their volume and cost would make it 
extremely hard for low budget or tight designs to shield themselves. Even big 
battleships would be vulnerable as missiles moved from storage magazines to the 
barbettes, unless almost all of the ship was damped, at great expense. 

This could make an interesting new weapon for TNE ships. It would be effective 
only against some ships, but potentially as damaging as an 8000MJ Meson gun (the 
explosion would be internal), harder to hit with, but harder to shield against. 
The dampers would need to be very large to have the range necessary, and would 
probably need to be heavily overpowered to have any chance at all of hitting, 
making them even larger and more expensive, but it could be interesting. I\'ll 
work out some rules and post them next week sometime.

   I#ll definately look into it.  I see potential on the battlefield for one

weapons.  They could go places that grav vehicles couldn#t (like 
densely forested areas).  Picture a platoon of them (say 6 total)

   Only a truly skilled pilot could do much more with it than
make it walk where you want to go and make simple hops.  There
is a scene from Robotech where one of the main characters tries
to pilot a mech for the first time.  He gets pretty good,
but demolishes a couple of city blocks in the process....

   The assumption is that you would turn the contragrav on at
a lower setting--say 50 percent of full power, thus decreasing
the weight of the vehicle by 50 percent (or close anyway).

   I definately believe this to be the case.  By TL 16 or so, it would be
possible to build a walker that was indistinguishable from an animal
in its movements and behavior (that is until someone opened a hatch
and got out).

   Combat walkers would tend to be 3 tons displacement and higher from
what I#ve worked with so far (that#s 42 kl).  Recoil is less of a
problem once things get to be this size, as most vehicles are.

   True, which is why wheeled vehicles still hang around for a while.
Legged vehicle development, however, appears to stop dead in its
tracks. Certainly the fact that there is but one example of a legged
vehicle that I#ve ever seen designed for Traveller (the Strider which
appeared in DGP#s 101 Vehicles) says something both in design and
storyline terms.

   In several publications this is mentioned. Perhaps this was a cover
for the fact that in original Traveller grav vehicles appear at TL 8.
I haven#t seen any lately, have you?  :)

>You\'ve either been playing Battletech or watching too much anime...

   Never played the former but have been guilty on occasion of the
later.  While my objective here isn#t to develop a cross over line, 
is would sure make finding miniatures easier.

   If I have to plead guilty to something though, I\'d have to say that I
have seen Stars Wars (all three movies) a bit too often....

(Yes, I\'m aware that taxes pay for roads, and most drivers are taxpayers. 
But we\'re comparing the total cost of two transportation systems here.)

Air traffic control is a big problem with grav vehicles.  So are issues like
privacy.  Solutions include things like altitude restrictions and flyways. 
Flyways are much cheaper than roads - no surfacing required - and if altitude
is restricted to, say, 5m then safety is also quite good.  (Yes, you\'ll still

Contra grav means that you can jump higher, but making the walker lighter will 
not improve your ground speed, as gravity is perpendicular to travel, so weight 
doesn\'t affect acceleration. Mass, on the other hand does affect acceleration, 
but this is not cancelled out by contra-grav. As suggested, reducing weight 
will, if anything, slow the walker down. This is because the walker can only 
move its legs so fast before the foot slips, this maximum speed is determined by 
the amount of friction with the ground. The more weight, the more friction, so 
the higher speed you can reach. Apart from jumping, contra grav would have one 
other use, it would make it easier to build a stable structure for the walker, 
by reducing stress on the legs from the weight of the upper body.

I like the idea of walkers, but they may not be as agile as anime films portray. 
The Dante robot, built to climb down into a volcano, took several days to reach 
the bottom, because of the care necessary in placing its feet. I can\'t remember 
the story exactly, but I\'ve got a feeling that it fell over in the end anyway. 
The Battletech walkers are not good examples of hard science fiction, they\'re 
far too large to be useful as all terrain vehicles, in woods they\'d trip up on 
trees, and in water they\'d fall over because of drag on their legs, but slightly 
smaller walkers like the Star Wars AT-ST could have some tactical uses.

While I agree with your general approach (spread 4.2*10^9MJ over spheres
of various sizes), I\'m not sure it\'s reasonable to model it as a single
laser beam.  IF you assume that the laser model is appropriate for a nuke
(and it may well be - the bulk of the energy emitted is as soft X-rays,
approximately equivalent to a TL-15 tunable laser), the penetration factor
should also be figured as well.  

In addition, the nuclear explosion attackes the entire exposed surface
area of the ship - some provision for this should be made, because all
exposed weapons and equipment will be affected.

Here\'s some suggested rules to play with (enjoy!):

Rad Hit 10km                    1km                     100m

Damage Effects:

A nuclear explosion within the "Rad Hit" range of a spacecraft will
produce a radiation hit, resetting computers (just as if the ship were
hit with a particle beam weapon).  Explosions beyond this range have
no effect on a spacecraft.

Ground Zero: Determine the hull surface location nearest the detonation
(use the hull surface locations diagram from T:TNE or BL), and the distance
from the hull of the ship to the nuclear device.  This location is attacked
with the penetration and damage value listed in the table above, exactly as
if it were hit with a TL-15 laser.  In addition, all systems which appear in
the Surface Hits damage tables for that location are damaged with the number
of hits indicated in the "Area" column.  In some cases, there will be excess
damage (any "Area" hits above 5H are automatically excess damage); this is
resolved normally. 

Primary Damage: All hull surface locations which share an edge with the one
nearest the detonation are also attacked.  The penetration, damage, and area
damage effects depend on the relative length of the ship and the distance
to the nuclear explosion.  If the overall length of the ship is smaller 
than the range to the explosion, then the primary damage range is the
same as thr ground zero range; due to the angle of the hull to the radiation
of the explosion, use one half (but never less that 1-1 or 1h) of the
penetration, damage, and area damage values that were used at Ground Zero. 
If the overall length of the ship is larger than the range to the explosion,
move down one row from the ground zero range on the chart; this is the
primary damage range.  Use the penetration, damage, and area damage values
from the chart for this new range.  Apply primary damage exactly like Ground
Zero damage (except that the range is larger, and therefore the damage is
less); note that this may affect systems which already recieved damage
atground zero (this is allowed).

Secondary Damage: All hull surface locations which share an edge with
one of the primary damage locations are also attacked.  The secondary
damage range depends on the primary damage range and the length of the
ship.  If the overall length of the ship is smaller than the priary damage
range (determined above), then the secondary damage range is the same
as the primary damage range; due to the angle of the hull to the radiation
of the explosion, use one half (but never less than 1-1 or 1h) of the
penetration, damage, and area damage values that were used in the primary
damage.  If the overall length of the ship is larger than the primary damage
range, move down one row from the primary damage range on the chart; this is
the secondary damage range.  Use the penetration, damage, and area damage
values for this new range.  Apply secondary damage exactly like Primary
Damage (except that the range is larger, and therefore the damage is less);
note that this may affect systems which already recieved damage at ground
zero or in the primary damage area (this is allowed).


Examples:

1) A 1MT weapon explodes about a shiplength (25 meters) astern of a
Broadsword-class mercenary cruiser.  Ground Zero is location 20, and it
is attacked with 1/6-18, of which 13 points (2 minor hits) penetrates
the ship\'s hull armor.  There are no systems exposed to a surface explosion
in this area, so no additional damage is done.  

The Broadsword is longer (at 28 meters) than the distance to the explosion,
so the primary damage area (locations 16, 17, 18, and 19) is treated as
if it were 50 meters away.  These locations are attacked at 1/3-9 (which
does not penetrate).  However, the airlocks, cargo hatches, antennas, and
docking ports in these areas all recieve minor hits anyway.

The primary damage range, 50m, is larger than the length of the ship (28m),
so the secondary damage area (locations 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15) recieves
half the damage that the primary area does.  Unfortinately, 1/3-4 damage
doesn\'t penetrate anything.  However the 1h (half of 1h, but never less
than 1h) surface damage now affects more systems: airlocks and antennas
in these areas, for a total of 6 more 1h results on each (and pretty
effectively destroying the antennas and airlocks on the aft hemisphere
of thie ship.

2) A 10KT contact nuclear mine detonates 1 meter (the length of it\'s contact
sensing elements) from the hull of Midu Agashaam-class Destroyer, in hull
location 7.  41 points of damage penetrate the hull, for 2 major hits.  In
addition, the antenna in that location recieves an additional 2H.  The ship
is much longer than a meter, so the adjacent primary damage area locations
(3, 9, 10, and 13) are attacked at 1/7-23, of whih 14 points of damage
penetrates, for 2 minor hits in each location, plus two major hits on both
the antenna in location 10, and the airlock in 13).  The ship is also
longer than two meters, so the secondary damage area (locations 1, 2, 5, 6,
11, 12, 15, 16, and 16) are attacked with 1/3-9 (which doesn\'t penetrate),
however, antennas, airlocks, and EMM radiators in these areas recieve 1h
each time they appear in the damage table.

Actually, no.  Without an atmosphere around the blast, nearly all the
energy should come out as either high-speed neutron radiation or "soft"
X-rays.  The bulk of the energy will be in the form of the latter.

In an atmosphere, these "soft" X-rays are absorbed by the surrounding
air, heating it to very high temperaturs (and thereby creating the
fireball and blast effects).  The fireball re-radiates a considerable
amount of energy, spreading it over a broader range of lower frequencies.
These effects don\'t happen in space.

Actually, no.  At detonation, the majority of a nuclear weapon\'s energy
output is "soft" X-rays (yes, these are photons, folks).  Just about
any type of matter absorbs this radiation efficently, and since FF&S
assumes that TL-15 tunable lasers would operate in these ranges, it\'s
a safe assumption that starship hull will be just as easily damaged
by nuclear-explosion-generated soft X-rays as it is by a laser weapon.

The writeup on dampers in FF&S suggest that you could use them to bring
down, not just a warhead, but an active fusion reactor.  This would be quite
effective, but the possibility seems to have been passed over in other rules.

   This technology becomes available at TL 12 I believe.  I have a great
deal of difficulty with the concept of a battlemech, however.  Arms
may have some utility on a walker in that they would allow it to better
manipulate its environment (like say piling up boulders to use as a
defensive position), but would be practically useless as melee weapons,
as it would be highly unlikely that a battlemech would get that close
to the enemy.  I\'m not sure what kind of weapons arms large enough
to be on a battlemech could hold, but they would probably be less
powerful than those you could mount in a turret, and have less of a
arc of fire.  As for a head--why?  Aesthetics perhaps?  You\'d
probably be much better off with a turret and no arms and no head,
IMHO.

I thought that the jump drive fuel requirements followed the following:
fuel = TL factor x mass of ship x ( jump Number +1 )
This being the case a micro-jump ( jump 0 ) would require half the fuel a 
jump 1 would no matter what the distance is within the system.
This would be the case because much of the fuel is used to create the hole 
in spacetime as opposed to travelling through the hole.

The problem with the association you\'re making here is that Dante is 
a first or second generation walker ---- very specifically not 
designed for combat.  A combat walker would have to be a stable 
weapons platform (i.e. it wouldn\'t fall over at the drop of a hat).  
As for anime style manuevers ---- people driving walkers would rather 
kill something at a distance...so infighting would lag in development.
  I think infighting abilities for walkers WOULD be developed 
eventually, at least for the smaller walkers (rate 3 and less), 
because they would be pitted against battle dress.

I definetly agree.

I\'ve been playing with a walker design that incorporates High Bypass 
Turbofans for \'jumping\' (inspired by Masamuni Shirow\'s Landmate 
designs in Appleseed).  Very small walkers like the AT-ST have 
definate potential...even more so when they FLY(I use an air 
efficiency of .2 and they almost outrun Grav tanks).  Big walkers = 
big targets (even if they\'ve got a few zillion megajoules of 
firepower).  Small walkers w/ jet engines = better than battledress 
and five times as deadly.

I\'ll go back to "lurker" mode now...

These are excellent rules, and I will use them.  The only thing needed for
space combat use now is a set of rules for getting a missile inside this
sort of range.

question: how should armour protect against the "rad" hit?

I agree with you, this was just to tell how it\'s been done in another system.

One thing about arms is that they have a much better movement arc than
turrets do. You 
can point them down or up much easier than you can turrets. And as you said,
if you 
have arms you can move large things as well.

As for the head: the only reason I can think of for having a head where the
pilot sits, is 
that you then have a very good place to put nosy and bothering subordinates.

   This is the same conclusion I reached after talking with someone

   Would this mean then, that the more legs you have, the slower you
go?  Or the opposite?  I don\'t think it would matter as long as the
transmissions were equally efficient.

   But how would you incorporate that fact into the design rules?  My
suggestion would be that transmissions, etc. could be smaller and
lighter on a contra grav equipped walker.

   Dante is (was) an example of a TL 8 direct input robot.  You would
move slowly too if you were faced with the kind of terrain Dante
encountered on its journey (we can assume it did a much better job
in the parking lot before being sent to its near doom--I seem to recall
reading somewhere that they managed to recover it).  Presumably
the ability of walkers to move and negotiate terrain would improve as
the technological level increases.

   The more robotic looking mechs in Battletech are able to move so well
because they incorporate a neural interface (as someone else pointed
out).  They are to a degree aesthetically pleasing--I object to them
because there are more efficient, cost effective ways to arm a walker.

   The Star Wars AT-ST makes a better model IMHO.  Though it has a
rather high profile, it would nevertheless be excellent for use in areas
where it could take advantage of cover and concealment (such as
the deep woods, jungles, and urban areas.  I would of course paint it
*anything* other than white (I guess the GALACTIC EMPIRE felt like they
didn\'t need to worry such trivial matters as camouflage).  The people 
who make Battletech miniatures make less robotic looking walkers in
addition to the high tech samurai types.  These also might serve as
design inspirations.

I suppose it\'s a trade-off between several factors - on a low-population,
high-tech planet, grav might be preferable, since the roads wouldn\'t get
the use to justify their building, (plus there wouldn\'t be the tax income
to pay for them). On a high-pop planet, this would be reversed, (a mixture
of the two might be best). Physical characteristics of the world would also
play a part: obviously, a water world would have few roads.

More legs would mean that you had more contact with the ground, so more 
friction, so you can go faster (it\'d be more stable too). The less you make
the 
thing weigh, the more ground contact you need, roughly speaking for constant 
sized legs, N * W = k  where N=number of legs, W=weight and k=a constant for
a 
given speed. The only reason why you can\'t have millions of legs and an
almost 
weightless robot is the cost and size of all those legs. Ideally, you would
only 
run contra grav when jumping, the rest of the time you may as well have all
the 
ground pressure you can get.

I\'d go with this, but there would be a point of compromise between structural

weight savings with contra grav, and the larger transmission you would need
to 
maintain enough friction to go fast. You could probably save 10-30% on 
transmission weight for a contra grav walker.

If you strapped really heavy weights to the end of someones limbs their
balance 
would be thrown off pretty badly, you\'d need some major hydralics to give
robot 
limbs a similar response to human limbs, but I suppose by TL12 that\'s not
such a 
problem.

The AT-ST wasn\'t just a scout walker though, it was a terror weapon, and as

This is _much_ too low, and seriously disrupts the way that in-system
travel works.  It is reasonable to assume that there is some minimum
amount of energy required to initiate a jump of any distance, and a
corresponding minimum amount of jump fuel required.

Back when BL and FF&S were still being written, members of the GDW-Beta list
(myself included) suggested to GDW that microjumps be made official, with
exactly the parameters suggested (fuel consumption equal to half that of a
Jump-1 for the same drive and ship).

For one reason or another, microjump rules were not included in T:TNE, BL,
or FF&S - I assume because GDW did not wish microjumps to officially exist
in the New Era Traveller universe.  As a VARIANT, I recommend allowing
microjumps, with the fuel consumption as detailed by Django above.

Note that in Classic Traveller, microjumps are part of the established
background history, although rules for conducting them were never provided.
Fuel consumption equal to half of a jump-1 is probably also reasonable,
however.

One more Nifty Thing.  The values in the tables I gave previously can be
adjusted for different sized nukes.  The general formula is:

	Multiplier = sqrt(Desired Yield / Table Yield)

In other words, if you want values for a 20KT warhead, multiply the 10KT
penetration, damage value, and area hits by sqrt(20/10), or 1.4142.
Here\'s a table to help you out; instead of saying "* .333333",
I\'ve given it as "/ 3", indicating division by three.

Yeild    Table and Mult
  2.5KT  10KT / 2
 40KT    10KT * 2
 90KT    10KT * 3
111KT    1MT / 3
250KT    1MT / 2
  4MT    1MT * 2
  9MT    1MT * 3
 11MT    100MT / 3
 25MT    100MT / 2

Round all fractions to the nearest (in other words .5 and above rounds up,
less than .5 rounds down).  The only exceptions are that penetrations less
than 2 round down to one, and penetrations or damage values less than one
indicate no effect.  Area hits work the same way as long as you are working
with major hits; less than 1 major hit (but at least a half of a major hit)
becoems two minor hits; less than half a major hit (or half of two minor
hits) becomes one minor hit.

I think I\'ve posted rules for that before.  :-)  Check the back issues of
TML, or use the following quick summary:

To qualify for a "short range" attack, a missile must:
  1) end it\'s flight in the same hex as it\'s target
  2) have remaining maneuver G\'s to match the target\'s evasion G\'s
  3) survive any point-defense fire

Roll a normal missile "to-hit" roll, with the following diff mods:

"Impact" = 3 levels harder
"Near"   = 2 levels harder
"Far"    = 1 level harder

MFDs can be used to offset those difficulty mods.  Once a hit is acheived,
roll 1d6 on one of the following tables to determine the exact distance from
the explosion to the target vessel.  Apply a -1 DM to this roll if the
target ship did not evade at all.

	Impact 		Near 		Far 
Die	Distance	Distance	Distance
0	0		10		 100
1	0		10		 250
2	1		25		 500
3	1		25		 500
4	2		50		 500
5	2		50		1000
6	5		100		2000

> question: how should armour protect against the "rad" hit?

Not at all; invest in radiation-hardened electronics and computers if you
want to survive radiation hits (ie: "fib" fiber-optic computers).

Actually, I can\'t find the *%*&#@} fuel use formula in the main TNE book (if
anyone has a page reference, please let me know. The couldn\'t have left it
out! Could they?)  FF&S  (p42) gives

Fpc = (Vjd *5) / Jmax

where Fpc is Volume of Fuel required for 1 parsec jump
      Vjd is Volume of the jump drive
      Jmax is maximum jump number of the ship

nothing states that the number of parsecs jumped must be an integer.  The
formula for calculating the percentage of a ship allocated to jump drive for
a given Jmax is very like the one you quote.

Not particularly.  Here are some things you can do to "deadly it up"
a bit.  While (reading the rules as written) these are variants, I
(and the rest of the GDW-Beta group) heartily recommend them.  These
are "House Rules" used in all the games I referee:

1) Roll weapons damage on d10\'s instead of d6\'s.
2) Apply the "Quick Kill" rule (T:TNE pp.286) to everyone, not just NPCs.

The combination of these two rules actually makes it possible to kill
a healthy person with a pistol shot to the chest (actually makes it
pretty likely - in a large number of firefights, the combination of
these two rules makes damage of \'1\' to the chest about 25% fatal).

NOTE: If you\'re playing a combat-intensive campaign, you do NOT want to
      do this; with the two variants in effect, about the only way for
      a character to live to a ripe old age is to avoid getting shot at.

Campaigns with mercenary or other combat-intensive themes would do better
with the lower damage, or without the Quick-Kill rule - it\'s a lot less
realistic, but the probability of player-characters surviving a major
firefight increases dramatically.

The Star Wars movies used two types of Imperial Walker:

The "AT-AT" (All-Terrain Armored Transport) was the giant four-legged
walking armored personnel carrier and fire support vehicle.  They played
a large role in the Hoth (ice planet) battle scenes from "The Empire
Strikes Back" - Luke and his snowspeeders fight with them.  

The "AT-ST" (All-Terrain Scout Transport) is the much smaller two-legged
walker that appeared _very_ briefly in "The Empire Strikes Back" (look
carefully for it during the ice planet battle scenes).  It got a MUCH
larger role in "Return of the Jedi", where it was used in the Endor (forest
moon) battle sequences.  Note that the large AT-AT walkers are seen briefly
in this movie, patrolling near the landing platform.

They probably have, but any bio-being who found out didnt live to 
tell the tale, hence no documentation of the fact.

Virus would definitly search for any artifacts of the Ancients, but 
whether or not It found any is another matter.  Anyway, I thought 
most of the Ancients sites were in the Spinarward Marches and further 
spinward.

He\'s probably laughing at the foolishness of humans who play with 
advanced toys before reading the instruction manual. :)

IMO, theres no need to apply rule 1 as using the "Quick Kill" rule, 
any weapon that causes 1d6 damage to the head or chest has a 17.5% 
chance of killing the victim.  If the attacker is lucky (skilled) 
enough to get double damage (exeptional (sp?) success) the chances 
for a quick kill are doubled to 35%.  To me this is reasonable as not 
eveyone dies from a head or chest wound.  As proof, in one of the 
Scientific American issues from a few years back, there was an 
article about the vision centres of the brain and how they were 
discovered.  During the Russian/Japanese(Chinese?) war, the Russian\'s 
were using high velocity rifles that fired small calibre bullets that 
only pierced the skull, rather than shattering it.  This caused many 
of the victims to survive head wounds and the doctors used this 
phenomenon (sp?) to locate the vision centre of the brain by 
correlating the entry and exit points of the bullet and whether or 
not the victim was blinded (the bullet passing through the vision 
center).

However, maybe the damage to the head should be doubled for the 
purposed of the quick kill rule (not actual damage if the victim 
survives).

OK, not that I doubt you, but where is this written?

I had always assumed that interstellar-only jumps made sense because
1) it\'s like a big cannon - shooting yourself a few parsecs is actually
   a lot easier than hitting something only a few million km away
2) it would be tricky to jump insystem due to all those damn gravity
   wells moving around all over the place.

But of course, canon rules.

For instance, one of the later CT products notes that microjumps were
commonly used in the Solar System by the Terrans for travel to the far
gas giants and Pluto, before the Barnard expedition mounted by the USSF. 
Jump-1 isn\'t good enough to get to the next star system from Earth in
just one jump. 

We always have played that any fractional jump distance requires as much 
fuel as jumping the next largest integer distance.  So an in-system microjump
would require as much fuel as a jump-1.  This seemed consistent to our 
group with the way, say, jump-2 would work.  Heck, it really doesn\'t matter 
that much as long as you pick one or the other and stick with it.

   Well Fire, Fusion and Steel for one (so that you can design a better
pistol), the Coalition Equipment Guide (which contains better pistols) for
another, and a more careful examination of the damage rules....

   Rulewise, there is the following to consider from the TNE Manual:

1) Blunt Trauma (page 285) - This can add up fast.

2) Quick Kill (page 286) - Makes that tiny little .38 more deadly than you
thought.

3) Knockdown (page 288) - Puts a character temporarily out of action.

4) Stun (page 288) - A stunned character is as good as a dead
character, and will soon be a KIA unless his buddies can rescue him.

5) The 40 point limit - once a NPC takes 40 points of damage, he/she
is done for the day, whether that damage was inflicted by pistols, or
by a HEAP flechette shotgun round at close range.

But if you aren\'t happy with those answers....

Description: The P-35 is carried by many Terran Republic Marines as
a backup to their primary firearm in combat, and is the official sidearm
of all Marine officers.  Developed during the Civil War Era, only one
kind of ammunition was ever made for it, as no other type was deemed
necessary.  Technically a machine pistol, it is prized for its knockdown
power and low recoil.  Once uncommon outside of military service,
it is becoming increasing popular with mercenary groups.

<snip>

   True.  Particularly in light of your analysis.  With the rules as written,
two walkers, one with two legs and running upright, moves at the
exact same speed as one with four legs, six legs, or even eight legs.
Is this accurate?  Your answer seems to indicate otherwise.

   Could the following chart then be said to be more or less correct?

Walker Transmission

TL          Vol             Cr
8            8                10,000
9            2                  2,500
10          0.4                  625
12          0.067              156
14          0.0096              39

Vol : Volume (in cubic meters) of a walker vehicle transmission per
MW of power

Cr: Price per cubic meters of installed transmission

Mass: (In tonnes) equals Volume

   Should the cut off be TL 12, or could you say that there is further
development at TL 14?  Is the rate of decrease in volume required
too high?

   That would have been par for the course for the GALACTIC EMPIRE.
If you noticed, it appeared that the Ewoks were planning on striking
at the Imperial garrison, Rebel Alliance or no Rebel Alliance, given the
large number of booby-traps and catapaults they had constructed.

   In Traveller terms, no one is as all-powerful as the GALACTIC
EMPIRE,  except maybe the Regency...then again they aren\'t an evil
empire...or are they?

   The AT-ST is also known as the \'scout walker\'.  It has two legs and
I believe a crew of two (with the possibility of one passenger--or at
least there was room for Chewbacca to sit behind the Ewoks for a
few moments after they took a walker over).

   The big four legged variety had a powerful main armament and could
carry troops (though how they disembarked is not shown).  They had
thick top and side armor, but were extremely vulnerable on their
undersides--Luke was able to disable and destroy one of the big ones
with a shaped charge.  Actually the big ones would probably last about
30 seconds on a Striker II battlefield, given the lethality of high tech
CPR and missile rounds.

Notes:

The Malkop Class Light Cruiser was commisioned by the Solomani Confederation
Navy in 1003 to replace their ageing and obselescent Pyrrhus Class ships,
which had suffered disproportionate losses against more advanced Imperial
ships.  The Light Cruiser is not really suited for fleet actions, but it\'s
2500Mj spinal Meson Gun makes this possible, if the task force commander is
prepared to take losses.

The Malkop proved it\'s worth in service against states rimward of the
Confederation and in \'border incidents\' with the Imperium following it\'s
entry into service in 1013.  By the outbreak of the Rebellion and the
subsequent invasion of the Imperium by Solomani Confederation forces in
1117, the Malkop was approaching obselesence.  A TL 15 replacement, the
12,000T \'Melbourne\' Class, entered service in 1128, but the number of
Malkop\'s produced over the past century ensured their continued service.  A
number were transferred to planetary navies and the forces of Solomani
client states, but the vast majority still bore the \'cross-hair\' symbol of
the Solomani Confederation at the Collapse.

Very few examples of this vessel survived into the New Era.  Two ships, the
SNS \'Voronezh\' and the SNS \'Nowy Huta\', were recovered by the Near Bootes
Commonwealth.  The \'Voronezh\' (now named the MN \'Medoc\') has been refitted
and now serves as the flagship of the Near Bootean naval forces.  The \'Nowy
Huta\' is slowly being restored to active service by the Royal Teuceri Navy,
it is expected to enter service as the HMTS \'Prince Hamura\' in late 1201.

All examples of the \'Malkop\' class light cruiser were initially named for
towns and cities on the Eurasian land mass of Terra.  Examples:  \'Ulan Ude\',
\'Archangelsk\', \'Cheb\', \'Hyderabad\' and \'Semiplatinsk\'.

I would be VERY surprised to find that Ancient computers are even
susceptible to Virus. The few that have been portrayed in
Traveller seem to be living machines, self-aware, and (probably)
capable of out-fighting Virus. After all, if the Cymberline
chips could occur naturally, there must have been at least one
Ancient site cultivating the little monsters. The Ancients
would surely have Virus-proofed all their systems, otherwise
the Final War would not have had to be so...PHYSICAL.

I was simplifying the situation by assuming that each leg is made as large as

possible. The walkers with more legs would go faster, but only if the legs
were 
roughly the same size as those on the two legged walker, so these walkers
would 
have a larger transmission, so the speed increase would be reflected in the 
rules. If they had a transmission of the same volume and more legs, they
would 
be very slightly better than the two legged walker, as ground contact scales
up 
with transmission dimension squared, and volume scales with transmission 
dimension cubed, but these scaling effects would probably be ignored for 
simplicity. The greater number of legs would probably require more control 
systems/maintenance aids etc. which would even performance out. I\'d recommend

that when designing walkers, the number of legs fitted should probably be a 
cosmetic decision, as the transmission volume is a pretty good indicator of 
performance.

> <Stuff about \'synthetic muscle fibres\' from Bri>
I don\'t know if I\'m thinking about the same thing, but I saw an article about

something like this on the news. The stuff resembled a sort of fibrous black 
slug, and it contracted whenever it was sprayed with concentrated sulphuric 
acid. The contraction was pretty strong, comparable to human muscle, but the 
amount of time for it to relax again was quite long (hours). 
The problem is that strength \'comparable to human muscle\' is way short of
what 
is necessary. Also, a chemical system like this has a maximum strength
possible, 
whereas a hydraulic system connected to a fusion plant has a much greater 
strength possible, it may not be as efficient, but you can pour energy into
it 
to get the desired effect. Despite this, artificial muscle would make a very 
interesting component for a humanoid robot, but as I haven\'t seen Vampire
Fleets 
this side of the Atlantic yet, I don\'t know how that could be integrated.

My immediate reaction was that it seemed a bit generous, but once a 
contra grav (necessary for the TL12/14 transmissions?) has been fitted, 
they would probably look better. Someone needs to do a walker design with
these 
to see if they\'re reasonable, I\'ll try and find time. The most important 
thing is that a walker of a given displacement should never have a higher top

speed than a wheeled vehicle of the same displacement, as walker
configurations 
are essentially inefficient. A TL 10 wheeled transmission design would
probably 
solve this problem, using magnetically levitated axles to remove most of the 
internal friction.

Yes, when dicussing walker design it\'s best not to think of how well
determined 
TL1 natives could do against them, with tripwires/pits/dropping treetrunks.

It _is_ real life. Such fibres exist currently except (to my limited
knowledge), the contraction and expansion times are currently of the order
of minutes to hours - not much good to your average walker... but wait until
TL12! Such fibres are then commonly used also for replacing injured muscles
in surgery, etc.

I was watching THE NEW EXPLORERS: THE SCIENCE OF STAR TREK on PBS on
Tuesday, and they showed a researcher who is making artificial muscle
fibers.  He said that they are 20 times as strong as human muscles.  So
far he only had a fiber the twice the size of human hair that could
pull a little water wheel. Its a start.
Also in FFS, in the cybernetic section don\'t they talk about artificial
muscle implants.  I don\'t have the book in front of me, so that might
be totaly wrong.

   Not so fast.  Medical researchers are working on developing artificial
muscles right now.  One would presume that in approximately 20 years
(when we reached TL 9 I think) they will have perfected the technology.
Of course applying that kind of cybernetics to a vehicle would be quite
an undertaking, but not impossible.

This has been my rule in the past, too.  I am, however, moving over to a new
near future campaign using the stars near sol.  I will probably use
fractional (per-parsec) fuel use rules for this.   Actually, since it is not
a GDW background, I may pay about with a lot of other details of technology
as well.

Hear! Hear!  Seriously, though, I really cannot find the normal intersteller
jump fuel use equation/table/whatnot in the main TNE book.  Can anyone out
there give me a page reference?

The Ancient technologies may be immune.  Virus seems to be a cross between
a life form and a highly experimental tech-17 AI project.  There\'s hints 
in the TNE rule book that a few old-era computers had security systems
effective enough to *beat* a Virus infection, requiring Virus to use
physical means to defeat or destroy them.  We definitely know that the
Regency has had some success at creating software defenses against the
Virus, also in the TNE book.  (It might help that the boffins on both
Vincennes and Darrian were interested in extreme-tech computers.)  If
the highly-advanced Regency can almost beat Virus, then the Ancients
should have no problem.  

The Ancients\' tech-25+ computers are for all intents and purposes living
beings -- self-aware individuals capable of creative thought.  Despite
astounding pseudoreality technology, synaptic processing, and fancy AI
routines, Imperial computers aren\'t nearly that good.

 That\'s a very good question.  I didn\'t have that line in the stats
 when I originally defined the format, so I don\'t have it in the
 explanation. Now that you mention it, I\'d like to know as well.
 Even some labels on the line might be useful...

Of course, the reason we suggested microjump rules was for
the same reason that started this thread, because of the way
the fuel-limited HEPLaRs changed in-system travel and
fronteir refuelling.

As someone who tried to think through all of the ramifications
of HEPLaRs and how existing Traveller concepts could be
re-thought to accomodate them, so that they would WORK
in Traveller, I have one suggestion:

Bag \'em.

Aside from CT & MT, the main reason to just toss them
is the fact that even GDW doesn\'t support them.
   Think about it: name a single TNE product other than
Brilliant Lances where the HEPLaR fuel limits were taken
into account.  Was fronteir refuelling one whit more difficult?
Nope.  "Death of Wisdom" has patrolling SDB\'s and Gazelles,
very wasteful considering how much fuel you have to burn
to get anywhere quickly.

Even Battle Rider dispensed with fuel limits (except
for certain "low fuel" units) as a bookkeeping headache, even
though the whole reason for changing the drive systems was
to add the spectre of "bingo fuel" to the combat situation.

So my suggestion is: if GDW can\'t be bothered to stick
by their own rules, don\'t you bother with it either.

End of rant, onto...

About the same effect as lemurs trying to conquer humans
militarily -- it ain\'t gonna happen.  That\'s about the proportion
of where the Virus is compared to Ancients\' equipement on
the technological/evolutionary scale.  Add to that the fact
that every Ancients site is technologically unique, so 
ANY insight learned from one site may well be useless
at another.

Well, they can seek them out, but who says they can take
control?  The Virus is a TL-16 critter, Ancients AI\'s are about
TLs 25-35.  Lemurs and humans.

Hmmm.... 

Scenario nugget: Players encounter a Vampire ship that isn\'t
controlled by Virus, but by an Ancients AI that the Virus
_tried_ to control and got eaten by instead.  Of course,
the AI is hopelessly hobbled by the stone knives and bearskins
equipement it\'s using, but such is (artificial) life.

Same as he (it?) reacts to anything.  Shrug, ignore it, but pinch
a sample into a pocket universe to study later. :-)

Delux Edition TNE (if you wan`t New Era Stats, or 1200 stats)
Astroligers Guide to Diaspora Sectore (Mega Traveller, same 1200 stats as
above ? I havn\'t cheaked).
Also I think DGP stats are avalable somewhere on the net, if someone could
tell the young gentalman were, cos I don\'t know.

Sorry, i didn\'t even know there were plans to look into that line of
research.

Does anyone have mor info on the subject?

BREAK

Microjumps:
If you try to use microjumps inside a solarsystem, especially in the inner
parts, won\'t the 
gravitational fields from the planets make it very difficult and dangerous? I
mean, you 
have to be at 100 diameters to make a "safe" jump outsystem, but the place
you end up 
is much farther from any body. So if you make a jump that ends up relatively
close to 
another body, won\'t this increase the chance of failure?

Challenge 77 should be out by now I think (do I remember a mailing about

     Upon entering the system, the first thing travellers notice about 
     Rhylanor is its bleak-looking slate and obsidian color and a scarcity 
     of active weather patterns.  Rhylanor\'s very thin atmosphere, rocky 
     composition and mineral-rich oceans make it as gray as jump space.  
     Scant meteorological activity can be accounted for by weak stellar 
     emanations coming from Rhylanor\'s solitary dying main sequence star, 
     Icarus.
     
     Despite the planet\'s humble appearance at 100 diameters, as travellers 
     approach close orbit they begin to notice immense amber and brown 
     splotches of urban sprawl on the small world\'s surface.  Rhylanor\'s 
     linear and hard-edged coastlines stem from massive terraforming 
     projects performed over generations since Rhylanor was settled in the 
     frontier days of the Spinward Marches (ca. 250).  Urban areas include 
     scores of arcologies, gravitic cities and even undersea settlements, 
     whose main business is the distillation of valuable ore products that 
     seep forth from Rhylanor\'s multitude of undersea vents.
     
     Before planetfall, travellers may want to stop at Rhylanor Orbital 
     Starport (R.O.S.) or "Ross," as it is affectionately known.  Ross is 
     home to some 600 million inhabitants.  Ross is unique in that it is a 
     modular orbital city, comprised of three separate units.  Normally the 
     three units are united into one cohesive orbital starport/city, but 
     during major fleet maneuvers or wartime, the three modules divide into 
     separate entities that are strategically placed at equidistant 
     vertices in point defense of Rhylanor proper. Each module is equipped 
     with a 2-G maneuver drive and dozens of PAWs, missile launchers and 
     meson-gun mounts for such exercises.
     
     The three starport modules are called Vord, Emberheim and Xao, named 
     for a famous scientist, entrepreneur and military leader, 
     respectively, drawn from Rhylanor\'s colorful history.  Emberheim, the 
     largest of the three modules, contains Rhylanor\'s massive orbital 
     shipbuilding yard.  Administered by the system government, major 
     portions of the yard are leased to Ling Standard Products and General 
     Products LIC.  Many smaller indigenous shipbuilding outfits also lease 
     manufacturing space at the facility.  Each of the three modules 
     contains space leased to the Regency Navy and Regency Interstellar 
     Scout Service (RISS) as well.  The majority of Rhylanor\'s SDB 
     squadrons are docked at Xao.
     
     Do not let the military presence overwhelm you, however.  Over 70 
     percent of Ross\' permanent population is civilian.  Most of the 
     civilian population is employed in some capacity by Rhylanor-based 
     subsidiaries of Regency megacorporations.  Numerous merchant lines 
     including such notables as Oberlindes lease or own major lots in each 
     of Ross\' modules.  Two arcologies are mounted on each module, housing 
     approximately 85 percent of the civilian population.  The remaining 15 
     percent live in settlements located in scattered areas of Ross\' 
     immense lattice-like structure.
     
     Let the free trader be forewarned that highly competitive trading 
     blocs operate on each of Ross\' modules, each with its own dominant 
     bloc.  The blocs are very turf-sensitive and will take quick and 
     decisive action against any offworlders who come into their territory 
     and trade without paying an appropriate obeisance to the dominant bloc 
     on the module.  The blocs are known to employ their own assassins and 
     on occasion independent mercenary groups to enforce their unwritten 
     laws.
     
     In addition to the dangers posed by the blocs, the powerful Rhylanori 
     Ministry of Trade (MT) keeps a watchful eye on all mercantile 
     activity.  The export of Rhylanori technology, especially cutting-edge 
     Rhylanori computer and robotics technology (see below), is heavily 
     policed by law enforcement agents assigned to the MT.  
     
     Despite the clannish trading blocs and intrusive MT on Ross, free 
     trade manages to flourish, with offworld goods constantly flowing into 
     Ross\' ports from throughout the central portion of the Regency.
     
     Proceeding to Rhylanor itself is a simple task.  Rhylanor\'s bicameral 
     government prefers to keep a hands-off approach for the most part, 
     allowing easy passage on and offworld.  Liberal weapon possession and 
     personal freedom laws are intended to encourage offworld trade and 
     touristry.  The MT presence is every bit as intrusive as it is on 
     Ross, but the moblike trading blocs do not have a presence on Rhylanor 
     proper.
     
     The Executive Proxy is the reigning government on Rhylanor, consisting 
     of eight senators.  The EP have historically been drawn from the ranks 
     of retired flag rank Imperial and now Regency naval officers, native 
     Rhylanori corporate executives, Rhylanori nobility and senior 
     legislative-branch politicos.  Upon taking office, each member of the 
     EP prepares a preferred list of three successors.  The senator may 
     optionally alter his preferred list at the end of each eight-year 
     term.  Most do not, however, as altering one\'s list is seen by the 
     electorate as a sign of weakness.  When a senator dies or willingly 
     secedes, the general population of Rhylanor votes for one of the three 
     successors to replace the senator.
     
     The EP, for the most part, try to facilitate free trade and offworld 
     touristry by maintaining a hands-off approach.  Their primary function 
     is directing the economy of Rhylanor, promoting industrial projects 
     and public works and generally touting Rhylanor to the rest of the 
     subsector and the Domain in general.  Legal power and administration 
     of the powerful MT is administered by the Magistracy, Rhylanor\'s lower 
     governmental house and judicial branch.  Magistrates are elected by 
     popular vote in population bloc electoral districts.
     
     A division exists between the governmental approach and native 
     Rhylanori sentiment to offworlders.  While the government does its 
     best to encourage free trade and touristry, the citizens of the planet 
     are to known to be rather smug.  In fact, "Rhylanori pride" is known 
     throughout the Regency as the defining characteristic of this system\'s 
     citizens.
     
     Rhylanori pride stems from historical events.  Rhylanor served as the 
     pivotal system in the Fifth Frontier War.  Advancing Zhodani forces 
     were stopped and turned back at its borders.  This elevated the system 
     to "godlike" status in the eyes of many, most especially the Rhylanori 
     themselves.  For a time, prominent local groups such as the Sisters of 
     Rhylanorae, the local Brotherhood diocese and the Olavopolis Patriot 
     Guild even lobbied the Imperium to establish Rhylanor as the new 
     capital of the Spinward Marches.
     
     Though Mora was eventually selected for astrographic and historical 
     reasons, most Rhylanori believe their world is more deserving of the 
     honor.  To this day each of the above-listed groups and many other 
     political action committees continue to pressure the First Regent for 
     a referendum on the subject.
     
     One might infer that the Rhylanori end up feeling like a Regency 
     stepchild, always coming in second best.  In fact, just the opposite 
     is the case.  The Rhylanori are a progressive people and look at 
     defeat as part of an ongoing struggle.  Any and all recognition is 
     quickly magnified and extolled.  The Rhylanori are extremely proud, 
     for instance, that their system is to be the location of the 1202 
     Regency Grav Ball Cup.  This event, while important to the 
     higher-population and technologically elevated worlds of the Regency, 
     has become a full-blown historical event to the Rhylanori, who are 
     always hungry for recognition and approval in the eyes of their peers.
     
     Offworlders may be put off initially by Rhylanori pride.  Attempts to 
     make trading pacts or, heaven forfend, establish permanent residency 
     on Rhylanor, may well be rebuked in the courteous but decisive 
     Rhylanori manner at first.  Persistence, however, wins out on 
     Rhylanor.  Offworlders will discover that the exclusive and 
     conservative Rhylanori greatly admire mavericks, entrepreneurs and 
     frontiersmen.
     
     In the colonial days of the planet, tough settlers had to brave 
     Rhylanor\'s harsh and unforgiving environment to establish the 
     foundation of what is, in their minds, the greatest jewel and example 
     of technological might in the Regency.  As a notable offworlder who 
     made his way on Rhylanor as an oceanic wildcatter once said, "If you 
     dig your way in like a tick on a kian\'s back, hold tight and weather 
     the storm, you\'re a Rhylanori for life."
     
     The capital city of Rhylanor and location of its main starport is 
     Olavopolis, named for the First Frontier War hero, Admiral Olav 
     hault-Plankwell.  Olavopolis is an immense city of five billion, and a 
     planetary nexus for commerce, education and industry.  The city is 
     comprised of arcologies, floating gravitic residential and industrial 
     centers and subsurface oceanic domes that extend beyond the coastline 
     of Olavopolis\' terrestrial sprawl.
     
     Arbellatracon, Rhylanor\'s largest city with eight billion souls, is 
     the planet\'s manufacturing center.  Consisting mostly of massed 
     arcologies, dismal industrial Arbellatracon is for the most part a 
     rough and tumble blue-collar city.  Eighty-eight percent of the 
     population are members of the Brotherhood church.  On their weekly day 
     of rest, Wonday, Arbellatrans don bright ritual compressor apparatuses 
     adorned with fetishes and ascend to the surface of the planet to pray 
     in the dim light of Icarus.  Under the moonless violet Rhylanori 
     skies, they engage in two to three hours of prayer and then return to 
     their apartments for ritual feasting and drinking (read:  gourging and 
     boozing).
     
     Rhylanor boasts several smaller cities as well, the largest of which, 
     Fuirmidh (pop. 90 million), is the home of the University of Rhylanor. 
      A referendum to rename the city Norriscon, after the Fifth Frontier 
     War hero and former Duke of Regina, was defeated in a landslide vote 
     in 1110, after opponents of the referendum successfully reminded the 
     citizens of Rhylanor that Norris too clearly represented Regina to be 
     worthy of such an honor.
     
     As for Rhylanor\'s technological might, almost all of the planet\'s 
     industries operate at TL-15, with Rhylanori specialties such as 
     computers, robotics and many aspects of starship building, achieving 
     early to mid-TL 16. 
     
     After the Rape of Trin in 1139, Rhylanor\'s robotics industry was 
     pressured to close down due to widespread hysteria.  Regency citizens 
     predominantly from pre-stellar to early stellar systems understood the 
     capabilities of the robotics industries of Rhylanor and other 
     high-stellar systems, and demanded that the Regency shut them down 
     until further notice.  Only within the last five years has Rhylanor 
     been able to finagle its way back into the business of creating robots 
     with its high-tech manufacturing infrastructure.
     
     In 1196, Rhylanor successfully plea-bargained the First Regent for 
     limited robotics production rights.  Part of the agreement includes 
     unlimited use and sale within the Rhylanor system and limited robotics 
     trade with its preferred trading partners:  Risek, Porozlo, Macene and 
     Jae Tellona.  Many of the leading-edge robotics firms, including 
     several divisions of LSP, have reestablished Rhylanor\'s benchmark 
     TL-16 robot production capabilities.
     
     Part of the agreement with the First Regent includes a clause that all 
     robots built by Rhylanori companies must be fitted with a special 
     "dumb firewall failsafe" device that activates itself if any virus 
     activity is detected within the robot\'s CPU.  The system is free of 
     volatile AI chips and thus labeled "dumb."  This clause is overseen by 
     the bureaucratic Regency Robotics Commission (RRC), who maintain an 
     office in Olavopolis that oversees all Rhylanori robot manufacturing 
     activity.  In the beginning of Rhylanor\'s new age of robotics, many 
     prototype robots mistakenly firewalled due to the sensitivity of their 
     systems.  Defects of this sort have since been eradicated.
     
     Word on the street has it that a lucrative black market Rhylanori 
     robot trade exists to serve buyers outside the RRC-sanctioned realm.  
     Buyers beware:  the RQS mercilessly prosecutes offenders of the RRC 
     regulations.
     
     Research in virus-proof robotics has consequently put Rhylanor on the 
     cutting-edge of virus-proofing computer technology as well.  The 
     Regency Navy, with a large presence in the system, takes full 
     advantage of their proximity to this technological advancement.  Local 
     computer companies bid aggressively for naval contracts.
     
     Members of Rhylanor\'s highly technical planetary navy, COACC and 23rd 
     fleet Regency naval personnel staff are drawn primarily from the 
     population of Rhylanor proper and other planets in the system.  
     Conversely, Rhylanor\'s army and marine regiments are only about 20 
     percent Rhylanori.  The bulk of Rhylanor\'s soldiers are volunteers and 
     conscripted troops from nearby Porozlo and Jae Tellona systems.  The 
     highly disciplined Jae Tellonan units are known as the "Rashakhras," 
     named for a long-dead Vilani warrior caste that fought in the 
     Interstellar Wars.  The Rashakhras are respected and feared throughout 
     the Regency and are known to be some of the toughest soldiers of the 
     Domain.
     
     The majority of Rhylanor\'s technological R&D talent comes directly 
     from each graduating class of the University of Rhylanor in Fuirmidh.  
     A hotbed of ideas and liberalism, UR has long been a place where 
     innovation and intellectual freedom flourish.  The conservative 
     population of Rhylanor often sneer at the mention of the university, 
     but grudgingly accept it for its merits.  Known during the Fifth 
     Frontier War for pro-Ine Givar student protests, the university 
     remains a place where dissenters can voice their opinions.  UR is 
     Rhylanor\'s bastion of liberalism.
     
     The very thin atmosphere freely admits stellar radiation from Icarus, 
     making the planet typically hot, averaging 21.3 degrees C.  The 
     atmosphere and extreme axial tilt of Rhylanor (48 degrees), however, 
     result in large daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations.  Because 
     of these extremeties, nearly all Rhylanori own and frequently use 
     compressors.  Those who engage in prolonged exposure to the elements 
     own vacc suits and PLSS systems.
     
     Rhylanor\'s weak natural gravity (0.28 G) is augmented in urban areas 
     by immense artificial gravity grids.  Rhylanor\'s urban artificial 
     gravity level is about 0.6 G.  Rhylanori technology also defies the 
     planet\'s weak planetary electromagnetism for the purpose of 
     maintaining its maglev public transportation network.  EMP generators 
     are maintained at intervals along the maglev public transportation 
     web.  The generators enable maglev to operate on the planet despite 
     Rhylanor\'s weak natural electromagnetism.
     
     The Rhylanori are essentially a proud and forward-thinking people 
     whose world is just reaching maturity in the galactic scheme of 
     things.  Though commercial enterprise and legal bureaucracy have made 
     their imprint on the system, native Rhylanori long for the days of 
     colonial freedom and the wild frontier.  Consequently, most Rhylanori 
     greatly admire the adventurer\'s spirit though most are loathe to give 
     up the golden handcuffs of their technologically advanced and 
     liberated society.

Two reasons: there aren\'t very many surviving artefacts, (and most are
safely \'behind the claw\'), and most of what there is is either broken or

Probably mildly annoyed, since Droyne are dying too.

*** Technoreality Alert ***

They didn\'t cheat; the technology actually exists, albiet in a very
weak and experimental version.  Some kind of colloidal gel that 
changes its viscosity in response to electricity-- they\'re looking
at it for use as artificial muscles in prosthetics.  There\'s also the
"memory metal" alloy (whose name I forget) that regains its shape
on application of an electrical current.
    If we\'ve got the basics at TL 7/8, think of how far it might go
in a few centuries...

     Not to long ago, I posted a message re: meeting women of the former 
soviet union through romance ads.

     In August, Olga will travel to Moscow from her home in Kiev, Ukraine.  
In Moscow, Olga will have a much easier and cost efficient means to place 
your personal romance ad throughout Russia.

Last week I received the following from Olga:

     "I have already sent your ad to the papers in such towns: Moscow, 
St. Petersburg, Vladimir, Kazan.  At nearest future I will send your ad to the
paper in some more 12 towns of Russia, where papers are published.
     Some times (in winter, spring & now) I placed your ad in other papers, 
but they are not most popular paper in Moscow and some large cities of
Russia.
     Besides, I am continuing to place your ad in papers of Ukraine.  I 
promise to place your ad in some other papers when I will come to Moscow in 
August.  I am glad that you have received fairly many letters from Russian & 
Ukrainian girls and I think you will received some more ones and will find 
your ideal in my country soon.
     I thank you very much ones more for your kindness & your help.
My best wishes,

Olga"

     This isn\'t a scam - call it panhandling if you want. . . I sent her $40 
or $50 and I\'ve received over 45 responses.  Unlike placing romance ads in 
the U.S., women from the former USSR respond.  Although one would guess the 
are doing so in the hopes of American citizenship, I haven\'t found it so.

     Olga lives in Kiev, Ukraine (population 3 million) and will travel to 
Moscow in August to visit her father.  If you were to send a letter this 
week, she would receive it in time.  The population of Moscow is 10 million 
-- (3 times the size of Los Angeles.)

     Feel free to send a letter and ask her your questions.  She will be
happy
to respond.

Olga\'s address:

     I am posting anonymously because of the flames and volume of inquiries 
that would result otherwise.  I think those who are truely interested will 
take the time to write.

Subject: polite note

     Although Olga has never seen a newsgroup nor heard of "net-etiquette," 
she believes that offering lonely singles the possibility of romance exceeds 
the cost of angering those who feel the net shouldn\'t be used in this
fashion.
     IHA (I humbly ask) that you not flame the postmaster of this site.

Exactly.  Grandfather (or one of the Kids) has undoubtedly been to
Cymbelline at some point in the last 200,000 years, learned all
there was to learn about the Cymbelline life forms, and filed away
incase there was ever any need for that data.

Who knows?  Maybe the central elements of his AI computers are derived from
Cymbelline life - "uplifted", and as you point out, about as far ahead of
their Vampire relations as humans are from the lesser primates.

Scenario Nugget: The Player Characters are locked in mortal struggle with a
Vampire when Grandfather\'s Acme Vampire-and-Virus Pocket Universe Pit Trap
is activated by the activity, and everyone (including, perhaps, the local
stellar system*) is sucked into a pocket universe for later scrutiny by The
Old Man ... er, Droyne ... himself.  Yaskoydray will drop in sometime in the
next couple hundred years to check on the Virus sample, but \'till then
housekeeping chores are in the hands of some of Gradfather\'s AI robots. 

Can the player characters subvert the robot\'s programming and get out of
their predicament before the Virus kills them?  Not a chance. 

On the other hand, they just _might_ be able to raise enough of a fuss for
the AIs to notice that the Virus sample was contaminated with some
biologicals, at which point the AIs will boot the PCs back out of the pocket
universe.  The AIs, because they are programmed as caretakers for living
samples, have a programmed dislike for solutions that involve the needless
destruction of life.  The referee should note, however, that in this
particular case Grandfather\'s AIs consider the Virus just as much "life" as
they do the PCs, and furthermore, it\'s the Virus that\'s Very Important
sample, and the PCs that are the contaminants.


* Extra-Sneaky Refs start here:

Alternate Scenario Nugget: One Of Our Stars is Missing - the player
characters are on a survey mission, and one of the stellar systems that they
just finished mapping dissapears on their way back home.  The players jump
in to where they thought their next stopover (and fuel source!) would be,
to discover that someone\'s stolen the whole solar system.  The PCs immediate
concern is where to get fuel - it\'s possible that Grandfather\'s Virus-sucker
left some debris around that could be scavenged for fuel, or that there\'s a
(possibly hidden) way to re-activate the trap, and get drawn into the
above scenario (their fuel problem is solved, but now how to get out
again?).

Oh no!  Someone who is not familiar with the whole legacy of Traveller!

Grandfather is the Ancient!  Okay, who are the Ancients?  Well, there
are a mysterious race that averaged around TL26-27.  They existed over
300,000 years ago.  They are the ones who are responsible for creating
the Vargr race out of ordinary Terran canines.  They are also
responsible for transporting humaniti (notice the old-school spelling)
through-out the stars.

Well, they had a war and basically wiped themsleves out.  Grandfather
was the head honcho of the Ancients.  He was highly intelligent beyond
all belief.  Right now he just lives in a pocket universe and watches
the silliness that takes place (and yes, he\'s also probably waiting for
the way-too-much delayed Regency Sourcebook 8).

Pssst.  Don\'t tell this little secret to anyone, but the Ancients were
actually the Dryone!  Shhh....

And I\'m sure that there\'s a whole bunch of stuff that I\'m missing (it
sucks getting into such a great game during the MegaTraveller era and
missing out on a lot of the original source material for CT).

As a matter of fact Diaspora\'s systems (and thousands of others) can be
found on a couple of FTP sites.  I downloaded about thirty sectors worth
from:

ftp.engrg.uwo.ca/pub/traveller/sectors

Now if you\'re using a windows operated machine (like myself), and you are
about as inept as I am at these type of things (something I genuinely doubt)
you should be warned that the sectors are in a UNIX compressed format (.z
files).  That means you\'ll need a U16.exe program to decompress them.  If
you have any trouble feel free to e-mail me (though I warn you it would be a
blind leading the blind situation - picture a vargr instructing an aslan on
solomani table manners).

I noticed that problem also.  I will make the following recomendation (which
i have used in my own campaign), please remember that this is by no means
"cannon":

use a d-20 for damage where the standard damages are used, keep the  d-6
where the tranq rounds are used.  this will allow most 2die pistols to
effectively "blow heads off".  be warned though, after i implimented this my
players became alot more cautious in combat.  (actualy, alot of them got
killed off very quickly.)

As people no doubt know, there has been a major flap going on over
TSR\'s actions regarding net archives of player-created works.  So
far, only three companies have come out with a clear statement of
policy with regard to this issue: TSR, Steve Jackson Games, and
Palladium, with Palladium and SJG taking very nearly diametrically
opposed views, and TSR being closer to the Palladium end of the
spectrum. (Side note: a message was posted here [by me] effectively
asking Loren to get a statement from GDW on their policy.  The last
time I followed up, several months ago, I was told that the lawyers
were still looking into it.)  The majority of the gaming community
seems to prefer that the SJG view prevail, but they apparently
accept that there will ultimately have to be a compromise between
SJG\'s view and the Palladium/TSR view.  Law in this area seems to
be fuzzy at best; it is widely believed that the law will
ultimately take guidance from (but not necessarily totally ratify)
general industry practice.  In an attempt to come to a reasonable
medium and establish it as general industry practice, Jim
Vassilakos, Larry Smith, Joel Hahn, and Guy Robinson have created
the policy appended to this message, and are asking for comments.
They have not gone to the game companies with it, yet; they want to
get a feel for how the customer community feels about it first.

Please send your comments to the list if you don\'t mind them being
public; I\'ll be happy to forward them.  If you want to comment
privately, you can send them to me and I\'ll forward them, or you
can send them directly to one of them, at the addresses below.  Jim
seems to be the designated contact.

Hi everybody. Larry, Joel, Guy and myself have been busy for the
past two weeks working on what we feel is a fair and legally-
sustainable compromise to this copyright issue. We intend to send
this to various RPG publishers to get their support, however,
before we take the big-plunge, we want to get some feedback from
you guys, the gamers on the net. Are you folks willing to abide
by this agreement if we somehow manage to get the companies to
accept it?

Please read it through and let me know what you think either via
email or here on the net. Thanks...  jimv@cs.ucr.edu

We, the undersigned, agree in principle that roleplaying games
represent a unique category of creative expression and, hence,
are worthy of their own set of rules with respect to copyright
violation and fair use.

A roleplaying game is part game system and part novelization. It
is a hybrid of two very distinct categories of expression. Hence,
the rules governing the fair use of elements of published RPGs
ought to be a hybrid of the rules used for standard board games
and for novels.

We hereby adopt the following standards until such time as the
courts and/or laws of our respective nations provide otherwise:


I. Definitions

A. Terms

   Roleplaying games tend to be couched in a distinctive
terminology that in some ways betrays the hobby\'s roots in war
gaming. These terms are used to codify the affairs of a
roleplaying game into something about which rules may be written.
As a consequence it is hard for a roleplayer to talk about a
given game without resorting to those game terms.
   For our purposes, a "term" is any RPG element which represents
an attribute of a given character, place, or prop and which has
some value or set of values associated with it which can vary.
For example, in 1st edition AD&D (which we will refer to often
since it was the earliest successful RPG) "hitpoints" is a term
which refers to a character\'s ability to avoid and absorb
"damage".
   Some common terms in AD&Dv1: strength, intelligence, wisdom,
dexterity, constitution, comeliness, class, level, hitpoints,
armor class, thaco, damage/attack, alignment, treasure type,
move, experience points, saving throws, etc.

B. Rules

   The rules of a game give a structure to what might otherwise
be considered just a group story or a collaborative discussion.
They provide a system by which to determine results. Hence, for
our purposes, a "rule" is any systematic method used in an RPG to
determine an outcome which is not specifically associated with a
prop (see below). For example, it is a "rule" in AD&Dv1 that if a
character falls 10 feet, he sustains d6 damage. By way of
contrast, it is not a "rule" that a character "hit" by a giant
chicken sustains d4 damage, as that determination is the result
of a prop attribute (see below), not a rule.

C. Props

   Everyone knows that nouns refer to people, places, and things.
Well, props are the "things" of roleplaying games. To be more
precise, they are modular elements of RPGs which characters can
belong to, have, or interact with during the course of an
adventure. Note that while props may refer to a category of
character (either racial or professional), they do not refer
individual characters. In short, characters are not props, nor
are places props. So what, then, specifically counts as a prop?
   Props in 1st edition AD&D include (but are not necessarily
limited to) monsters, character races, specific magical spells
and psionic abilities, skills and proficiencies, character
classes and sub-classes, weapons, armor, magical items, and other
miscellaneous equipment.

   Prop Attributes: The "attributes" of a prop include any terms
and their associated values with respect to the general case of
the prop in question. For example, the attributes of the "Giant
Chicken", an unofficial creature for use with AD&D, may be
written as follows:

     Frequency: Rare      # Appearing: 1-10
     Armor Class: 7       Move: 15"
     Hit Dice: 1+1        % in Lair: 50%
     Treasure Type: Nil   # of Attacks: 1
     Damage/Attack: 1-4   Intelligence: Animal
     Alignment: Neutral   Size: S
     Thaco: 18            XP: 20+2/hp

   Prop Vitals: The "vitals" of a prop include any important
terms and their associated values with respect to the specific
instance of the prop in question. That is to say, while
attributes would be used with respect to "Giant Chickens" in
general, one would use vitals to delineate in game terminology a
specific encounter with some given number of Giant Chickens. For
example, some vitals of a random Giant Chicken might be written
as follows: (HP:3, AC:7, TH:18, D/A:d4, XP:26). What qualifies as
important depends on how the prop is being used. In the example
provided above, the prop is a creature to be used in a combat
encounter. Hence, the combat-related attributes are considered
important, and hence the vitals which are listed are all combat-
related.

   Prop Description: The "description" of a prop includes any
information which cannot be quantified by the game terminology.
For example, the description for the Giant Chicken might be as
follows: "The giant chicken lives in giant chicken coops in
Wisconsin where hero-wizards tend their flocks of sheep."

D. Characters & Places

   Roleplaying is primarily an exercise of the imagination.
Individual players assume the roles of characters in a fictional
game universe, a sort of virtual setting in which the imaginary
events of the game take place. This setting is, essentially, a
fictional background which is either wholly created by the
GameMaster/Referee or which is provided in some sketchy format by
the publishers of the RPG for the GM/Ref to detail.
   Characters are the imaginary people in this roleplaying
background. For example, Navero, the altar boy once played by Dan
Parsons in an AD&D Campaign, is a character. Characters may also
exist as items which have an identifiable and unique personality.
For example, Elric\'s Sword can be considered a character. It is
important to note that races, monsters, and classes are not
characters. While an individual "elf", an individual "orc", or an
individual "fighter" may be characters, until they have been
characterized with an identifiable and unique personality, they
are only props.
   Places are the imaginary localities of a game setting. Hence,
the cities and dungeons Navero visited during Dan Parson\'s
campaign were places.


II. Assertions

A. Terms

   We assert that terms are _not_ copyrightable and that it is
perfectly legal for individuals to incorporate game terminology
into their own works to create and to publish without restraint
new props and rules for any given game system.

B. Rules

   While the letter of copyright law preserves the right to
create a "new" game by paraphrasing the rules of an existing one,
we hold that this is an unethical attempt to steal intellectual
property, and we do not condone or support that. However, we do
support the right to create and distribute alternate/variant/
replacement rules for an RPG as well as new/supplementary rules,
so long as (a) no actual text of any original rules are quoted,
and (b) so long as the author clearly states that the rules he or
she is writing are not a product of the vendor of the game system
so modified and/or supplemented.

C. Props

   We assert that props are copyrightable to the extent that they
are original, but that even if they are completely original, they
may still be legally referenced.

   Use in game supplements and adventures: While the prop
"description" may not be copied outright and verbatim, the
"vitals" of props may be inserted into unofficial game
supplements and adventures as long as the source of the material
is properly cited (see Subsection II.F below).

   Use in programs: The "attributes" of props may be incorporated
into computer software programs in order to determine "vitals"
for any sort of random-generation application. Again, the source
should be properly cited (Subsection II.F).

   Use in stories: Props which can clearly be identified with a
particular game system (i.e. props which are not from mythology
and which are not generic to the genre) can only be used in
stories to the extent they can be used in game supplements and
adventures (i.e. only vitals may be quoted). Since quoting game
stats in a story is generally not going to be desirable, it is
likely most authors will prefer not to use props which can be
identified with a specific game system. For example, there is
little point in saying "Three Umber Hulks show up" if you aren\'t
allowed to describe the Umber Hulks.
   Note, however, that although races are protected by copyright,
it is necessary for someone alleging a violation to show that all
vital elements of the race have been used. You cannot have in
your story a tall, gorilla-like creature called a "Wookie" that
speaks only in grunts and howls and uses a crossbow that fires
light bolts. You can, however, have a short humanoid with furry
feet, a fondness for food and a predilection for extra-legal
acquisition of personal property, provided it isn\'t called a
"Hobbit" (or a "Halfling" for that matter, which is what TSR is
calling them).
   Our suggestion in light of this practice is that you either
acquire permission to use the race in a story or that you change
the race\'s name and enough of its important characteristics to
make it usable in the story as your own separate creation. Of
course, you can use the mythological version of any race that
exists in mythology so long as you stay away from a particular
gamesystem\'s version of that race (for example, the AD&D version
of the Drow is somewhat different from the mythological version,
so if you want to have Drow in your story, make sure you don\'t
use the AD&D version without TSR\'s permission).


D. Characters & Places

   We assert that characters and places are copyrightable to the
extent that they are original. Unlike props, they may not be
referenced except within the most narrow confines.

   Use in game supplements and adventures: You may not write
adventures or supplements which take place in or make use of some
specific locale of a previously published game setting or which
make use of a previously published character. For example, you
may not write an adventure which takes place in Shadowdale of the
Forgotten Realms or which makes use of Elminster the Mage. You
may, however, write an adventure which "could" take place in the
Forgotten Realms or which could even take place in Shadowdale, so
long as it does not refer to specific locales within the Realms
or Shadowdale. In short, either allow the individual GM to
situate the adventure or base it a setting you created yourself.

   Use in programs: You may not write programs which incorporate
or otherwise make use of copyrighted characters or places.

   Use in stories: You may not write stories which make use of
copyrighted characters or places without the permission of the
copyright holder. If you write stories, base them in your own
setting or get the permission of the copyright holder to use
theirs.

E. Attributing Trademarks

   Before a registered trademark is used, it must be properly
attributed to the trademark holder in a conspicuous location of
the document or program (for example, "This Product is for use
with AD&D. AD&D(r) is a registered trademark of TSR, Inc. and is
used here without permission. This use is not intended as a claim
of ownership over the trademark.").
   There are various ways to properly attribute a trademark. Here
are three methods which hopefully might work. (Note: As stated
before, we are not lawyers, so if any of this is wrong, somebody
please correct us.)
      1. List all the trademarks used in the document in a
paragraph at the beginning of the document. You do not have to
make any marks [such as (r) or (tm)] next to these trademarks
during the actual use in the text.
      2. Capitalize all trademarks in the document and write a
paragraph at the beginning of the document disclaiming all
capitalized trademarks as being owned by whomever their
respective owners are.
      3. Insert marks [(r) or (tm)] next to each use of a
trademark. With the first use of each trademark, include a
footnote citing the owner.

F. Providing Source Information

   Whenever a prop from another publication (commercial or
non-commercial, electronic or non-electronic) is referenced,
provide information as to where to find the full description of
the prop.
   * If the source is an individual, state the name or pseudonym

G. Statement of Compatibility

   Observe one of the example formats when alleging compatibility
with a given game system.
      (Good) Example: "This adventure is compatible with AD&D."
      (Good) Example: "This adventure is for use with AD&D."
   Do not use the following format:
      (Bad) Example: "This is an AD&D adventure."

H. Recommendation of Material Requirements

   Inform the target audience what materials are required to
properly use the work in question. For example: "To run this
adventure, you will need a copy of the \'Players Handbook\', the
\'Monster Manual\' and the \'Dungeon Masters Guide\', all published
by TSR."


III. Questions & Answers

A. Porting of Props

   Question: Under these guidelines, are we allowed to "port"
props from one game system to the next? For example, are we
allowed to port Traveller\'s "Aslan" to AD&D?

   Answer: You are allowed to quote the vitals of an Aslan when
writing an adventure for Traveller. However, it would make no
sense whatsoever to quote these vitals in an AD&D adventure. The
two games use entirely different terminology. You may make up
your own AD&D stats for the Aslan if you wish (note, you will
still need to cite your source since you are lifting the name
"Aslan" from a previously published work), but you may not quote
verbatim any significant part of the description of the Aslan. In
short, the answer is no. These guidelines do not allow the
wholesale porting of races between systems.

B. Free-of-Charge vs. For-Profit

   Question: Why aren\'t you making any distinction between works
that are distributed free-of-charge as opposed to those which are
distributed for-profit? After all, this distinction figures into
the first legal criterion for determining whether or not a
derivative work qualifies under fair use. Furthermore, several of
the companies so-far friendly to their consumers on the Internet
have established this in their own policies as an important
distinction.

   Answer: Unfortunately, the courts in the United States don\'t
seem to have made as big a fuss over this criterion as many on
the net would like. Profit and non-profit constitute just one of
the tests a court may apply in determining whether a given use is
"fair use", but it is not statutory, nor is it required in all
cases. In fact, it normally doesn\'t apply unless the court needs
additional justification to substantiate educational use.
Granted, the criterion does come into play when determining fines
if the use is deemed an unlawful infringement of copyright (for-
profit use will trigger a potentially greater fine than non-
profit use). Nonetheless, when determining fair use, the
criterion just isn\'t used as much as most people think.
   Furthermore, making such a distinction does not serve our
purposes in the broader sense. While the immediate issue is to
protect the interests of gamers in distributing their work in the
non-profit arena, if we were to yield the point that only
non-profit work should be protected, then we would be
surrendering competitive marketing opportunities that are in the
best interests of the entire roleplaying games publishing
industry.
   As is stated in the Constitution, the government is empowered
to grant copyrights in order to encourage the production of new
intellectual property. It grants no authority to issue copyrights
because they are profitable or because the author has a "right"
to make money from them, and its authority in this matter ends
when copyrights can be used to block the production of new
material. The Supreme Court has been very consistent within those
boundaries.

C. Re-writing Entire Game Systems

   Question: Within these guidelines you state: "While the letter
of copyright law preserves the right to create a \'new\' game by
paraphrasing the rules of an existing one, we hold that this is
an unethical attempt to steal intellectual property." Is this
really true that the law allows such paraphrasing of an entire
game system? I mean, suppose some company named Voodoo Games does
a complete rewrite of Chivalry & Sorcery and calls it Voodoo
Madness. Obviously, the makers of C&S (wherever they are these
days) wouldn\'t like that one bit.

   Answer: To quote some copyright law: "Copyright protection
does not extend to any idea, system, method, device, or trademark
material involved in the development, merchandising, or playing
of a game." Judging from this statement, Voodoo Madness would be
treated as a new game, albeit one with enough similarities to use
props and adventures and programs and so-forth that were written
to be for use with C&S. Consider it to be "C&S Compliant." To
port this example to the computer industry, there is nothing that
Intel can do to stop AMD from marketing their 486 clone as a 486,
and not even their trademark on the name "Pentium" permits them
to prohibit AMD from claiming its processor is "Pentium-
compatible."
   Despite the clarity of the law, however, people still disagree
as to whether or not such acts in the RPG industry are ethical.
Some argue (as has been successfully argued in the computer
industry) that copycats serve to lower prices and enhance
quality, hence yielding the consumer more bang per buck. However,
we feel that in the RPG publishing industry, such a practice
would be counterproductive simply on the grounds that it is much
easier to copycat a game system than it is to invent a new one,
and hence it is possible that given that option, that is all that
companies would do. This, of course, would reduce innovation, and
it would be bad for the consumer as well as for the hobby in
general. Of course, we also feel that such a practice would be
immoral. People would be able to capitalize on the hard work of
others without paying any licensing fees or royalties whatsoever,
and we feel this is unfair. Since winning lawsuits against such
actions seems somewhat unlikely in light of the current laws,
litigation in such circumstances will probably be designed to
punish and drain resources rather than to win. For the reasons
stated above, we feel such litigation is justified.

D. Campaign Write-ups

   Question: Many gamers like to write-up the events of their
campaigns. Often these campaigns take place in professionally
published game settings. You seem to be stomping on the use in
campaign write-ups (i.e. stories) of races, monsters, as well as
characters and places from such game settings. Isn\'t this against
everything that gamers on the Internet want?

   Answer: Unfortunately, yes, it is against what many people
want. There are certain areas where the law doesn\'t seem to be
designed very well with respect to what we want. Not only does it
make the rewriting of entire game systems legal (something most
gamers could care less about, but something that most games
publishers are bound to hate), but it also seems to make writing
stories about published races or published settings illegal
infringement (something many games publishers wouldn\'t care
about, but something many gamers would like to be allowed to do).
In writing this convention, we tried to steer clear of our
personal wants and prejudices and instead stick fairly close to
the law. We fully expect that some publishers will go the extra
mile and say, "You can write stories set on this game world or
incorporating these races/monsters," however, we didn\'t feel
justified in establishing this for all publishers, particularly
when we knew that such a stand would probably eventually be
struck down in the courts and hence undermine this entire
convention. Everything we put into this work we expect will prove
legally sound. Hence, we see no reason why any game company
shouldn\'t embrace this convention. At least then, we\'ll all be
operating from the same legal altitude and there will be no more
guessing as to what\'s okay and what\'s not.

I think, from a couple of quick reads, that I can live with this
policy.  I\'d quite frankly prefer a policy that is more amenable to
story-writeups of campaigns, and similar non-game works, but I have
to agree with Jim with regards to the current state of legal
sustainability.

Loren, if you\'re reading this, I\'m not asking you to comment on
this proposed policy - in fact, I\'m asking you to wait on such
comment until GDW is approached directly.  However, I think the
list would still like to see some sort of official/semi-official
guidelines from GDW on the general issue of community-generated
materials for the Traveller line.  Are we anywhere near seeing
such?

   With tripwires, about as well as the Ewoks did I should
think (useless). Pits...hmmm, those could be trouble, but
those would be trouble to anything that walked (including
humans). Another use for contragrav, eh?  Just as the natives
send up a cheer because they trapped one of the mechanical
monsters that is tormenting them, it raises slowly out of the pit
and wreaks havoc on them.  Dropping trunks wouldn#t work if 
the side and top of the walker were sufficiently armored, which it
appeared the Imperial scout walkers weren#t.

It is time for the new GM to ask more questions.  I hope you guys don\'t
mind helping me out.  Nothing seems to be where I expect it to be in the
rules.

What is the role of wear value in starship maintainance?  Earlier in the
chapter, the rules say that you roll for breakdown every 8 hours, but this
seems a little extreme for a ship in jump.  Even a ship with a wear of 1
and a good engineer will never last a week in jump.

Does maintainance cost money?  Or does the crew just walk around
tightening screws and pushing buttons?  Does the wear value have any
effect on time or money?

How much fuel is used in normal maneuvers?  The rules say it is based on a
formula based on weight, acceleration, etc., but never gives the formula.
Is the formula in some $30 supplement?

As you can tell, we have gone from trying to buy equipment to trying to
fly the ship. :-)

Highly intelligent, awesomely powerful psionic, has the

dimension beyond our own accessible by Gates
known to the initiated; amuses itself watching the foolishness 
of mortals, and for all we know, is waiting for "the stars to be right
again".  Sounds like a Great Old One to me.

The question is, is Yaskaydroy mentioned in the Necronomicon,
and would you trust the sanity of anyone who had read enough
of it to know?

are mostly flame wars, a few issues do get passed by and these issues

In the first case, many companies have or at lease believe have an
implicit copyright on their own scenarios for the various games.  
Thus TSR for example would have a copyright on their Forgotten 
Realms, as well as GDW on their TNE universe.  Unfortunately, there
is (If I remember, \'though I forget the exact incident) case 
president in fantasy fiction where one writer gave permission for
another writter to write a story in her fictional world and in 
essence lost her rights to her originial fictional world.  This
bodes ill for players who want to publish their campaign stories,
which are based off of the GDW campaign worlds.

A similiar case is where a company is working on something that
soneone later posts something similiar to.  This gives the appearance
that the company \'stole\' the writers works.  This is one more
reason why companies might be not as easy to let such things occur.

These are only a few of the things to consider in such a generic
document.  After the flames die down I think there will be a slow
but painfully thought out compromise from the various companies.
One thing is clear, if the courts do get dragged into this, both
the gamers and the gaming companies will come out the clear loosers.

The article\'s main points are:

1. Number of ships in port
2. Number of Docking Bays per port
3. Jump-point - incl. star system jump-point cascade
4. Encounter Tables - ideas in their creation

The following text is taken from Section 3, "Jump-point":

"The jump-point J-1 is the largest solar mass in-system and the next
largest mass in-system with an unconfined jump-point is J-2, and so on."
Examples of confined jump-points were Mercury and Venus, being within
Sol\'s 100-diameter limit. The article also said that "... a starship
could have an unconfined jump-point if it were outside the jump-point
of a planet or star".

The sample table is shown below:

"Unconfined Jump-points in Two Sample Systems

      Terra/Sol     Regina/Regina*
J-1   Sol           Lusor
J-2   Jupiter       Assiniboia
J-3   Saturn        Olybrius
J-4   Terra         ----
J-5   Mars          ----
J-6   Ceres         ----
*Lusor only
Note: - Terra is just barely an unconfined jump-point.
      - Titan is partially unconfined at J-3 Saturn.
      - Olybrius is an unconfined J-3 only when it is farthest from
        Lusor, and may be partially confined when nearest Lusor.
      - Regina is easily accessable through J-2."

You\'re exactly right - the rules, as written, will have practically every
starship with wear value of 1 or more kill their occupants on the first
jump.  You should treat those rules as only applying to cross-country
trips with military equipment in a post-nuclear-holocaust 21st century Earth
setting (in other words, the wear rules are holdovers from Twilight:2000
that were just dropped into T:TNE and applied to starships without actually
thinking about them, let alone actually playtesting them).


For starships (and other "high-reliability" equipment, as determined by the
Referee; all spacecraft are automatically "high-reliability"), rolls against
the wear number should be made no more often than once per week.

If you\'re using the "generic" system (one wear value for the entire
starship), roll once per week, determine the system that malfunctions,
(or potentially malfunctions) and implement the incedent at some
appropriate point during the week.

If you\'re using the "detailed" system (wear values for individual systems),
make the roll the first time the system is used during the week. 


It\'s also worth noting that the "detailed" system is not equivalent to the
"generic" system.  A wear-5 starship would have a 50% chance of a potential
breakdown each week (affecting one system).  Broken into three wear-5
systems, the ship would have a 87.5% chance of at least one potential
breakdown a week, approximately eqiuvalent to wear-9.

To convert from "generic" to "detailed" (or back again), you can use the
following table and procedure:

Wear	Chance		To determine the composite (generic system) wear
0	1.0		value of a ship that has multiple systems, each
1	0.9		with it\'s own wear value, determine the "chance"
2	0.8		corresponding to each wear value, and multiply
3	0.7		them together.  Subtract the result from one,
4	0.6		then multiply by 10 and round to the nearest
5	0.5		integer.  This result is the composite wear value
6	0.4		of all of the systems.
7	0.3
8	0.2		Wear = 10 * (1 - Chance1 * Chance2 * Chance3 ...)
9	0.1	

For most ships, it\'s reasonable to assign wear values by trial-and-error,
repeating until the composite value is correct.

Example: A ship using the generic system has a wear value of 3.  The referee
would like to break this up into four "systems" (maneuver/power, jump, life
support, and electronics).  As an initial guess, he assigns wear values of
2, 1, 0, and 1 respectively.  To calculate, .8 * .9 * .9 * 1.0 = 0.648;
and 10 * (1-.648) = 3.52, which rounds to 4; a bit high.  Setting all the
wear values to 1 results in 3.439, which rounds down to 3.

> Does maintainance cost money?  Or does the crew just walk around
> tightening screws and pushing buttons?

Right.  "Maintainance" costs (hoses, fan belts, and the occasional oil and
oil filter change) are presumably included in the operating costs of the
starship.  Again, the maintainance rules are lifted from T2k, where purchase
of such maintainance items is impossible, and the characters are assumed to
jury-rig, make do, and scrounge.

In Traveller, presumably the cost of any maintainance parts is included in
the day-to-day operating costs of the ship (life support costs, annual
maintainance costs, and so on).

> Does the wear value have any effect on time or money?

Well, you generally spend more time going around tightening screws and
pushing buttons on a high-wear ship, in an attempt to gain favorable
modifiers if there ever is a potential breakdown.


> How much fuel is used in normal maneuvers?

The starships in T:TNE have their maneuver fuel duration listed in G-hours.
Thrusting 1 hour at 1G (a G-hour) consumes 1 G-hour of fuel.  Thrusting at
4Gs for 1 hour consumes 4 G-hours of fuel.  The rules for maneuvering around
a system give thrust requirements in G-hours; you can figure the required
accellerations in G-hours, and the ship will consume the appropriate amount
of fuel.

No, a $16 supplement.  All the starships that are available in the T:TNE
base rules have their meneuver fuel listed in G-hours in the ship\'s data
listing.  To design your own starships, and figure out their fuel
consumption, you need _Fire, Fusion and Steel_.  The ship construction
rules (an earlier and less-complete version) are also in _Brilliant Lances_;
however if what you want is support for a role-playing campaign, I suggest
FF&S.  If your players like the idea of boardgaming-out starship encounters
(or if you actually intend to conduct starship combat) I suggest _Brilliant
Lances_, as the starship combat rules in T:TNE are nearly unplayable as
written, except for the simplest encounters beteween the smallest starships.

* Anyone who disagrees with this assertion can join me for an all-day
session, gaming out an encounter between a Broadsword and two SDBs using
the T:TNE rules exactly as written.  With several hundred die rolls per
combat round, I expect it to take a while ...

Michael, thanks for looking this up in FF&S -- I found it there as well.
My post is more of a grump about GDW proofreading.  One of the following
cases must be true:

(1) This formula is the main TNE book, which should be all a person has to
buy to play the game, and I am just blind.

or

(2) You really don\'t need that formula because the information is provided
in some other way that I cannot figue out.

or

(3) They are bound and determined that you WILL but FF&S, so they left it
out on purpose.

or 

(4) They screwed up.

I\'d like to believe its (1) or (2), but I really only can find the formula
in FF&S.  Can anyone find it in the main book?

Come now, Derek. Possibly, certainly; propably, maybe; but undoubtedly?
After all, space is big and filled with lots of junk. To say that Gramps
(or even the Kids) has been to _every_ hunk of dirt in and beyond Charted
Space seems a bit excessive. Besides, he wouldn\'t\'ve found anything on
Cymbeline until after that Solomani spaceprobe crashed there (how many
years ago? 3000 or so, wasn\'t it). Now, there\'s evidence that he visited
our universe at least once within the last couple of thousand years (the
coyn showing an aslan), but there\'s no reason why he should have visited
Cymbeline at the same time (on that occasion he visited all or most of
the droyne worlds to distribute the new coyns). If Grandfather only
visits us every once in a while he may not even know about the Collapse
yet.

Since they were made 300,000 years ago that\'s not very likely.

That was about about as far as I got.  The players have a beat up old far
trader (wear 7) and it says that it has 24 G-hours of fuel, 39(?) if jump
fuel is used.  What does that mean?  It gave a time required for fuel
purification of some amount of fuel, which we assumed must be the fuel
capacity.  How much of the fuel is maneuver fuel and how much is jump
fuel?  How many cubic meters in a G-hour?  Am I missing something in the
rules?  Am I asking too many questions? :-)

Howdy,

I have been thinking that it would be nice if GDW could give us the basic
hull-forms used in FFS page 12.

In other words, what does "needle" mean, and why 3 times the diameter of a
same-volumed sphere (and not 3.2 or something)----what is the formula for the
dimensions of the needle?  Same for the other configs.  Cylinder is easy, but
it would help to know what the "type specimens" were the way we know the
table
on page 11 is based on a sphere.

I was wondering this when looking at the Midu Agashaam. It says it\'s a Wedge
SL,
and length is 105 meters----why isn\'t it more scout-shaped (my vision of
wedge)?

Also, the Vargr corsair, and the CEs are all the same config, but different
lengths.  I know they are just guidelines, but it would help to know the
ideal
shape for the config in order to help figure out which one a design is (also
just to help visualize designs). (am I crazy, or is the Valor\'s length just 
plain wrong (44m)?)

All and all I hate the fact that length is gelled in the hulform table.  For
my own stuff I make sure the volume is calculated for the shape I use.  Why
not
for example, make a 100,000ton hullform with a length of 350m (wedge) and
then
subtract half the hull?  Now you have a 50,000ton cruiser that can mount a
long spinal weapon (not that you need one with their laser rules), but I 
digress...

Bottom line: It\'d be nice to see what the "type forms" look like.

Well, \'very probably\' at the least ... details below.

Umm, no actually.  According to the background material (Signal GK, assuming
that GDW hasn\'t officially invalidated it yet), Cymbelline was the home of
naturally-occurring electronic-based silicon life forms since \'way before
the Solomani starship crash-landed there.

The original point of the research expedition was to locate Cymbelline
life-forms that had incorporated bits of the Solomani chips into their
structure, and thereby learn Interesting New Things.  They certainly did
find that (complete circuit patterns - which they didn\'t expect to find),
as well as sentient life-forms (which they REALLY didn\'t expect to find).

As a homeworld of naturally-occurring, silicon-based electronic life forms,
I\'d think that it\'d be at least as interesting to Gradfather and the Kids as
any other world with pre-sentient life.  It\'s well-known that Grandfather
\'tried out\' the available sentient races in an attempt to find the right
kind of assistants, before settling on artificially-intelligent robots.

No argument there.  And even if he knows about it, he probably doesn\'t care.

I don\'t think the date that electronic, silicon-based life forms established
themselves on Cymbelline has ever been given.  All we know is that they
already existed when the Solomani starship crashlanded there; we don\'t even
know if sentient chips existed before then, or if they are a recent
development.

My offhand reaction is that sentient chips already existed at that time, 
recognized the potential of the Solomani devices, and incorporated them into
their own composition.  Here\'s why: recent work with "genetic algorithms"
(computer programs that "evolve" to solve certain problems) have shown that
hand-coded algorithms, while they display significant short-term benefits
(they are typically smaller, faster, or more efficient at accomplishing
their designed task) are poor long-term survivors in these experiments
(because they aren\'t very adaptable, and are genetically fragile: change
some bits at random, and they stop working entirely - imagine that!).

By analogy, I\'d expect that native Cymbelline lifeforms would be (to an
electronic engineer) poorly organized, slow, and inefficient at the primary
design goal.  But, by being flexable and genetically robust, they and their
progeny would survive for generations, while human-designed circuits
wouldn\'t be able to adapt or reproduce well (if at all).

However, if there were sentient or presentient Cymbelline organisms, it seems
to me that they could recognize the advantages human-type circuits could give
them.  By using these tools, they could get specific tasks accomplished in a
faster, more efficient manner.  In short, they could learn the concept of
technology (at least, the kind of technology that applies to living
electronic
circuits) by example.  And (assuming they did learn that lesson) they could
then incorporate this technology into their lives.

(Sky)Walkers: A Walker Design Sequence Supplement

Version 1.0

by Harold D. Hale


Introduction

     The general consensus is that the appearance of 
contragrav at TL 9 and HEPlaR at TL 10 renders most 
forms of ground transportation obsolete--so much so that 
a TL 12 ground car is almost unheard of (unless you\'re a 
nostalgia buff who wonders what it would be like to cruise 
a highway and have to parallel park).  

     Development of walker type vehicles also comes to a 
grinding halt.  Though there is some development in this 
field after TL 10, the results are specialty vehicles which
operate on worlds where contragrav equipped types have 
difficulty safely maneuvering because of weather patterns 
(high winds would undoubtedly wreak serious havoc on a slow
moving contragrav transport, not to mention what it would 
do to the passengers\' stomachs) or other factors.                
                                                               
     But what if contragrav weren\'t available on a world 
until later on, say TL 14 or 15 (or was never developed)?  
After all, we Terrans aren\'t even close yet to having the 
"flying cars" pictured in "Back to the Future" and other 
Hollywood flicks dating back to the 50\'s and we have 
achieved TL 8 in many areas.  Wouldn\'t there be some worlds 
that chose to develop walker vehicles to their technological 
conclusion (whatever that may be)?  And what about worlds 
where walkers were developed, and later contragrav was
introduced?  Would they abandon their walker vehicles
immediately, or would there be a transitionary period where
walkers were retrofitted with contragrav?

     This supplement attempts to address these issues by
providing the designer with more advanced walker design 
tools. You must own a copy of Fire, Fusion & Steel (FF&S) 
to utilize this design sequence.

Disclaimer: This design sequence supplement incorporates 
material copyrighted by GDW.  It is being posted for the 
sole purpose of testing, evaluation and general feedback.  
Use of this material for other purposes is not a good 
idea. Really.

Walker Vehicle Design

Step 1. Chassis

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section. 
Walker chassis are available in the same types and 
materials as other vehicles.

Step 2. Suspension

     Select a suspension type appropriate to the vehicle.
Improved walker suspensions appear at TL 12, and take 
advantage of gravitic (if available), cybernetic, and 
materials technology advances. Advanced walker 
suspensions are similiar, and capitalize on advances in 
those fields made up to TL 16.  Advanced walker and 
Improved walker vehicles require that a contragrav unit 
be installed in the vehicle. Contragrav generators can be 
found on page 24 of the FF&S manual.

WALKER SUSPENSIONS
                     TL     Vol     Mass     SA     MCr
Walker                8     2.8      2.8     80     0.0028
Improved Walker      12     1.4      1.4     80     0.0056
Non-Grav Imp Walker  12     2.1      2.1     80     0.0042
Advanced Walker      16     0.7      0.7     80     0.0112

TL: Tech level available. Vol: Volume in kiloliters 
(cubic meters) per displacement ton (14 kl) of hull. 
Mass: Mass in tonnes per displacement ton of hull. 
SA: Useful surface area in square meters is equal to the 
chassis material volume (from chassis size table) times 
this number. MCr: Price in millions of credits per 
displacement ton of hull.

Step 3. Control Systems

     Improved, Non-Gravitic Improved, and Advanced 
walkers require a computer of a tech level at least equal 
to that of the vehicle. The computer may be of the 
standard variety, or a flight computer type.  Regular 
walkers do not have this requirement.

Step 4. Life Support

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.

Step 5. Electronics

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.

Step 6. Weaponry

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.

Step 7. Power Plant

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.

Step 8. Transmission

   All walkers regardless of type must be equipped with a 
walker transmission. The size of the transmission depends 
on the tech level of the vehicle and the power available 
for the transmission.

WALKER TRANSMISSIONS
          TL      Vol/L      Cr
           8        8        10,000
           9        2         2,500
          10        0.4         625
          12        0.067       156
          14        0.0096       39

TL: Tech level available. Vol/L: Volume (in cubic 
meters) of a legged walker vehicle suspension per 
Mw of power output designated to the transmission. 
Cr: Price in credits per displacement ton of hull.

     Improved and advanced walkers can also have their 
power plants modified to provide thrust by the addition 
of propellers, a combustion chamber, or to power a more 
exotic drive. The variety of thrusters available is 
detailed in the Sublight (Maneuver) Drive Chapter (9) 
which starts on page 69 of FF&S.

Step 9. Crew

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.

Step 10. Cargo

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.


Design Evaluation Modifications

1. Check Step

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.

2. Record Design Features

     As described in the Ground Vehicle Design section.

3. Determine Movement

   a. Ground Movement

      Road Speed (Ground):
          Base road speed in km/hr = 5 + ([MW / LW] x 2500)
          MW: Vehicle motive power in megawatts
      	  LW: Loaded weight of the vehicle in tonnes

          Modifiers
          Each tech level above 5          +1 kph
          If standard walker               x0.25 kph
          If improved/non-grav imp walker  x0.4 kph
          If advanced walker               x0.5 kph

      Off-Road Speed (Ground):
          The Off-Road Speed of all walkers equals their 
          Road Speed.

      Vertical Movement (Leaping):

The above line (beginning "C7D-6" ) was for an "improved" UWP profile 
code I created.  I won\'t use it in the future.

If you REALLY want to know what it mean\'s, email me, and I\'ll root around 
for the code key.

And Jeff, you\'ll probably have to wait till September for any new RICE 
paper\'s from me. (Hey, blame my boss!)

Starship fuel is used for three purposes: to fuel a fusion power plant, as
fuel for a jump drive, and as reaction mass for a maneuver drive.  The
power plant fuel consumption is constant and miniscule compared to the other
two fuel requirements (power plant fuel is subsumed into the power plant
itself, and can be safely ignored).

The ship in question, a far trader, has fuel for a single jump-2, and 24
g-hours of maneuver in addition to that.  If you forgo the jump, and use
the jump fuel as maneuver drive reaction mass, you can get a total of
40.8 g-hours out of it.

Unfortunately, the starship listings in T:TNE are a little unclear on the
exact details; here\'s the breakdown (you can develop this data using the
starship design sequences in _Fire, Fusion, and Steel_, or _Brilliant
Lances_):

A 1-g maneuver drive for a 200-ton ship requires 100MW of power, and 
consumes 25 cubic meters of reaction mass per hour.  To put it more
plainly, 1 G-hour of maneuver fuel is 25 cubic meters of liquid hydrogen.

A jump-2 drive for a 200-ton ship requires 210 cubic meters of fuel to
perform a jump-1, or 420 cubit meters of fuel to perform a jump-2.

Working out your jump requirement (420 cubic meters), and maneuver fuel
(600 cubic meters) gives the listed total fuel load, 1020 cubic meters.

Does that help?

> It gave a time required for fuel purification of some amount of fuel,
> which we assumed must be the fuel capacity.

Yes.

Unfortunately, T:TNE does _not_ give notes on fuel consumption by subsystem
(where it is really needed, because the design rules that let you calculate
it aren\'t provided).  These breakdowns _are_ provided in the ship listings
in Brilliant Lances.

Go figure.

> How much of the fuel is maneuver fuel and how much is jump fuel? 
> How many cubic meters in a G-hour? 

You can arrive at approximate figures by dividing the total fuel load (given
in the \'time to refine\' entry) of 1020 cubic meters by the given 40.8 
G-hours maximum maneuver endurance to compute 25 cubic meters per g-hour
maneuver fuel consumption.  Then, figure out the \'normal\' maneuver fuel load
(24 g-hours * 25 cubic meters each = 600 cubic meters), and subtract this
number from the total load to compute the jump fuel (1020-600 = 420).
Divide this by the maximum jump number of the ship to figure the cubic
meters of fuel consumed per parsec.

This same technique can be used on other ship listings in T:TNE.

> Am I missing something in the rules?  Am I asking too many questions? :-)

No, and no.

The rules are missing something ... it would have been a Really Nice Thing
to have included rules for figuring fuel consumption in T:TNE, instead of
(for example) directions on how to paint miniatures (T:TNE pp.327-328).
Nice as that item is, I get the distinct feeling that more Traveller players
have campaigns that include starships than use miniatures in their games.

#define CYNICAL_MODE

Of course, selling miniatures nets GDW some money, as does selling copies
of FF&S and/or BL to people who want workable rules for starships.  Selling
a game that is complete under one cover does not generate such a strong
demand for follow-on products.

#undefine CYNICAL_MODE 

In my humble opinion, basic rules for building starships should have been
included in the T:TNE rulebook (as was the case in all previous editions
of Traveller).  These rules would have occupied less than 20 pages,
approximately the space used by one of the sample adventures.

   First, thanks for the complement.  Now to find some poor sap--err, I
mean willing volunteers to test drive it to see if it breaks under pressure.

   Second, I patterned the modifier table after that in FF&S and added the
additions for improved/advanced walkers.  I had interpreted it to mean
that you apply the +1 kph per TL *before* you applied the walker speed
modifier (the x0.25 etc.).  This however may not be correct.  The
difference is an important one, since it can add several kph in some
cases to the speed of a walker.  For now, go with my interpretation.
Assuming Loren is reading this, I\'m sure he\'ll get around to telling us
if I\'m wrong.

   What do you say Loren?

Agreed. The only question would be wether they ever found them - which I
would agree is _very_ propable. Not 100%, but I\'d assume it unless I had
some super scenario idea that depended on the Ancients not knowing about
Cymbeline.

No, but if they existed 300,000 years ago then any present-day descendant
in Ancient hands would have as much relationship to their present-day
naturally-evolved Cymbeline cousins as something bred from a trilobite
would have with humans (And, yes, I know that trilobites are hundreds of
millions years ago, not 300,000 - electronic "generations" would IMO be a 
lot shorter than biological (especially in a breeding program)).

Okay, so now my fire is stoked, and I feel like ranting and raving. 
Please bear with me, because I would like to hear some people\'s opinions
on the topic(s) at hand.

Well, painting the miniatures, c\'mon, a page or two for something like
this isn\'t too bad.  Especially since Traveller\'s combat system is
easier played out on a board rather than trying to visualize it in your
head.

Starship creation rules.  Well, it would have been nice.  They could
have used the version in Brilliant Lances which takes up only 8 or so
pages (off the top of my head, so I may be a page or two off).  But I
won\'t really complain.  There are other sci-fi and space opera RPG\'s
that don\'t include any rules like this in their basic book either.

I don\'t see anything wrong with FFS.  After all, it does what it\'s
suppossed to do.  It tells you how to build almost anything in the
Traveller universe.  It\'s comprehensive and it includes sections on
alternative technologies.  For the money I think it\'s worth it.  Also,
I\'m trying to think if anything like this really exists for any of the
other space RPG\'s that I play.  No, not really.

However, did I really need to have to buy Vampire Fleets for four-six
pages worth of information on how to build robots?  This information
should have been included in the original book.  At the very least they
should have made it a separate pamphlet type thing that you could order
directly from them (GDW) for $2.00 or $3.00.  Or, they could\'ve done
like they did with the black-powder design and put it into a Challenge
article!

Speaking of which (can you say pent-up hostility?) where are the maps
of Diaspora and player aid cards that were promised to be shipped
separately from the Deluxe set.  Guess what?  Yep, neither my rulebook
or FFS say Mk I Mod I.  I proudly bought them when they first came out.
I remember reading that everthing that was packaged with the Deluxe
boxed set would available separately for about $5.00.  Hey, I\'ve
already spent the $41.00 on the books, I don\'t want to have to spend it
again!  Ah, but I\'d like those maps.  Someone from GDW tell me what to
do.

And finally, The Regency Sourcebook.  Probably most players gripe with
TNE.  Like where the hell is it?  Why wasn\'t it released two years ago?
I know that GDW wanted to develop the RCES stuff and then move their
way on over, but what about the rest of us who want to be in a
different part of the galaxy?  Four pages on the Regency isn\'t really
enough.  Star Wars for example, develops products for varying timelines
in parallel (one month may be for a product between the movie eras,
another might be for after Dark Empire, etc).  But they develop their
universe from more than one angle.  This used to be the greatest thing
about Traveller.  If GDW didn\'t cover it, someone else did.  Maybe
Seeker or Group One or FASA and god bless DGP (what ever happened to
their vapor-game AI anyway?).  But now no one puts out anything for TNE
and the absence is really felt.  And you know what the really tough
part is?  In the rulebook it says to go out and buy old Traveller
products for more information on areas not covered by the rulebook. 
Well, it\'s all out of print.  Unfortunately, I got into Traveller
during the MT days, so I missed out on a lot of the stuff for CT.  And
nowadays it\'s almost impossible to find any of that stuff (especially
in Delawhere?).  But then again, people aren\'t exactly knocking down
the doors to get TNE stuff at my local hobby store.  I wonder why?  If
the hardcore, die-hard, buy-it-anyway-because-it-says-Traveller-on-it
fans are making this kind of fuss and griping this much over the game,
then can you just imagine what the rest of the gaming world must be
thinking?  Why should they want to buy this game?

However, before I go, I do want to end this on a positive note.  The
basic rulebook is great.  I like it.  I like the `one big tome\'
approach instead of the many little books.  The rule revisions are
good.  Granted it\'s now Traveller:2000 8), but the character rules are
more indepth (when was the last time you didn\'t have the option of
changing your career?).  The skill rules still have the same feel and
the combat rules cover almost any situation.  It\'s comprehensive, and
it\'s a beautiful (once in a while I\'m even proud that I still play it).

So, without being cynical, let me just leave you all with this wish
list.

Paul Brunette, "To Dream of Chaos," GDW, 1995, $5.95, 342 pages + 9 page 
Glossary, Paperback, ISBN 1-55878-184-6


OVERALL IMPRESSIONS

  Those of you who read my review of the first of GDW\'s Traveller novels, 
"The Death of Wisdom" will remember that I was less than kind.  I am 
happy to say that I found this book rather better, though still not 
great.  If "The Death of Wisdom" deserved no more than a D grade, "To 
Dream of Chaos" is a solid C+.  The action descriptions are good, 
the plot fairly interesting, at least for the first 80% of the book (more 
on this later), and the character development good.

  The only objection I have is the same one I had to "The Death of 
Wisdom" - everybody, and I do mean everybody, is stupider than the PCs, 
and the PCs are none too bright themselves.  Needless to say, I can\'t 
really go into this without spoiling the plot, but for me at least it 
rather spoils things when the protagonists are able to outwit their 
opponents almost at will.  What this series needed from the begining was 
a smart villain - unless the Hivers are behind everything (and I\'m sure 
they are), there really is nothing going on here beyond some heroic 
thrashing about.

  However, if you look beyond the plot, there is some good stuff for a 
Traveller GM here, even Traveller GMs who don\'t use The New Era setting.

PLOT

  It gives essentially nothing away to say that the mission involves a 
journey beyond the boarders of the Reformation Coalition to find a cache 
of pre-Collapse high-tech weapons.  The crew from the first book returns 
intact, with a few extra obvious NPC ground-pounder Marines.  Since the 
crew did so well last book, this time they get extra weapons on their 
ship and a Intrepid tank.  They leave from Aubaine, visit Oriflamme (nice 
short portrait of that planet\'s culture), and after having a few 
adventures along the way, get to the planet where the cache is supposed 
to be.  The characters then thrash about.  Without giving away the plot, 
I can\'t tell you about how things degenerate into a cliche around page 
250, but suffice it to say a different and hopefully more original ending 
would be a lot better.  Aside from that, pretty good, with the caveat 
that the protagonists are smarter than everybody else (god, I hate that!).

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

  This is the area of most improvement over the first novel.  The author 
spends some time on character development this time, and I had a much 
greater sympathy for the individuals described.  I was actually sad when 
some folks were killed off.

TRAVELLER CONTENT

  There are plenty of descriptions of stuff from the Traveller universe,
and long-time Traveller fans will feel right at home.  I sighed with
nostalgia when a Kinunir-class frontier cruiser showed up - I had such a
good time with that adventure back in 1979 (Classic Traveller Adventure 1,
for you newbies out there).  By the way, Hiver "Corn Dogs" are served - Yum
Yum!  We even get a hint that they are some subtle form of Hiver
manipulation (but what Hiver thingie isn\'t?). 

OVERALL

  Again, a solid but not inspired effort.  I\'d enjoy discussing the plot 
with those who have read the book, but I\'ll keep that off the list until 
everybody who wants to read it has had a chance to do so.  Private e-mail 
welcome.

This is my first and, in all probability, last message to this list.  I\'m 
only still lurking here because I lost the FAQ and don\'t know how to get 
off.  The "signoff" thing doesn\'t seem to work.

OK.  First off, I LOVE TRAVELLER.  I always have.  I\'ve played it since 
1979 and still have the little black box.  I never played MegaTraveller, 
but I have all the TNE stuff.  I really like TNE.  I especially like the 
campaign background and the interesting way that you can play at least 
three different campaigns (Regency, Wilds and RCES).

What I HATE is something everyone on this list apparently loves: Math.

FFS made me madder than hell.  I can\'t play the game adequately without 
starships, and I have no intention of tracking power allocations, screw 
thread sizes and TL-13 shoelace styles.

I\'d like a GAME, not homework.  I know that I could just say "OK, you\'ve 
got this starship, see?  And you\'re in space..."  But I\'d like to be able 
to design ships without all the in-depth crap.  Something somewhere 
between FFS and Battletech would be nice.

So the guys at GDW know a lot about engineering.  Great.  I\'ve read some 
amazing articles in Challenge.  That\'s where I\'d like it to stay.

I like Traveller so much, especially the TNE universe, that I\'ve been 
thinking about trying to run a HERO system game in the TNE universe.

But I shouldn\'t have to.   Those that want to do all the heavy 
calculations should be able to, but the game should also support those 
who just want to play a game.

And while I\'m ranting...

I\'d like it if there were a list where I could talk to lovers of the 
GAME, as opposed to the mechanics of the game.

Thanks for listening.  I feel better now.

Bye.

[WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS IF YOU ARE IGNORANT OF THE DROYNE!!]

Yaskoydray, Coyns, Chirpers and Droyne

It all started millenia ago (about 300,000 years before the Traveller
universe),
when one Droyne developed his psionic powers to such an extent that he could
prevent his body from aging. This Droyne decided to explore his universe,
conduct experiments on everything he could envision, and generally muck
around
having a Good Time.

Pretty soon, he discovered that he needed long-term helpers for his various
projects ("normal" Droyne simply died too quickly to be of any help). The
Droyne decided to have children - and they had grandchildren - and assigned
them various tasks - eg. re-invent the wheel, in ten different ways.

Some of The Kids are mentioned in CT: the giant machines of Vland and the
Fire
Pits of Darrian (among others) both date from this period. Other efforts
include
the uplifting of Terran canines to create the Vargr race, the creation of
ringworlds and a Kempler rosette or two, the dissemination of humaniti among
the
stars, and other such unimportant issues.

After many years (about 30,000), The Droyne - now known as "Yaskoydray",
which
translates to "Grandfather" - began having difficulties with his kids. Their
projects had expanded way beyond their original form, and were conflicting
(horror of horrors) with Grandfather\'s own projects. He decided that his
original idea to have kids was a mistake, and set about to eliminate them
all.

At first, The Kids though he was only kidding. Later, they fought desperately
to
stay alive. The Final War was fought at TL 25-30 (!!), with Grandfather
emerging
victorious. He killed all his children (apparently, he "kept careful count"),
then dissappeared into a pinched-off "pocket universe" along with the Droyne
homeworld ("Eskayloyt" [sp?]) and star system, plus 2 other star systems.

(If I post the original location of these systems, is this a "spoiler"? After
all, Adventure 12 has been out for many years.)

Devastation from the (original!) Final War includes the asteroid belts of the
Geonee systems (plus MANY other areas of Imperial Space), the ocean craters
on
Zhdant, the contra-terrene matter in the Shionthy Belt, and so on.

The poor old "normal" Droyne suffered badly from the War, losing the ability
to
"caste" - that is, the ability to put each Droyne into a category within
their
society: Leader, Worker, Drone, Technician, Warrior, and Sport [have I missed
any?]. Basically, the War blasted them back into the Stone Age as Chirpers
(uncasted Droyne).

Many years later, Grandfather emerged again from his hidey-hole and began
visiting his experiments in Charted Space (for example, Regina\'s missing Gas
Giant). He must have noticed and felt sorry for the Chirpers, and so gave
them
"coyns". These solid gold discs have various things stamped on them,
including
a stylised flame, ice, death [what DOES that look like to a Droyne?], each of
the six Major Races, and each of the six[?] castes. The coyns are used as
psionic focuses when the Droyne are assigning a "caste" to a new, immature
Droyne. Coyns are drawn until a caste coyn is picked - which becomes the
caste
of the new Droyne. The casting ceremony causes fundamental biological changes
to occur in the infant, so that Warriors are 6\' tall and much stronger than
the 3\' Drones; Leaders are much cleverer, and so on.

Hopefully, the Regency Sourcebook (which has become the Great White Hope of
long-term Traveller players) will give more details on the Droyne than were
presented in the original TNE sourcebook. Things which could be expanded
on are: ow to create a Droyne PC, how to use psionics in a game, how do you
curb a Psi-15 Droyne (with all the skills) who was converted from CT/MT...

He\'ll have heard about it. DGP\'s \'Vilani & Vargr\' describes an android left
by 
Grandfather to watch over the Vargr, Idhren-Gzal, who regularly reports to 
Grandfather. So the collapse, at least from the Vargr point of view would be 
known to him (if he pays any attention to Idhren-Gzal). Of course whether
he\'s 
bothered by it is anyone\'s guess.

Which was copied straight from Robots Book 8 and not clearly linked with the

through Vamp F in a store - pay out for that? In my non-Virus Imperium? Ha

I wonder why? What with blanket thousand-odd dollar payments required to get
official recognition, the blanket condition that anything you write may then
be scrapped at will by GDW if it doesn\'t fit in with their future plans...
There are few stores (certainly in the UK) now that will sell photocopied
booklets with cheap cardboard covers (except a few second hand stores, of
course). So how can anyone else expect to break into the market without
investing thousands in going straight for pretty colour covers, etc.?

The _really_ successful magazines, etc. are the ones into which people have
put their hearts and not worried quite so much about the glitz and glamour.
Even then, the readership dropped off sharply when people bought TNE and
thought "Yuck".

>Why should they want to buy this game?

They don\'t. That\'s pretty obvious.

Personally, I can understand a lot of the griping but (as has been discussed
in this forum before) the rules systems are there to be used - if you don\'t
like them, don\'t use them. The background\'s a little more limiting but you
can invent a new reason for the \'Fall\' produced by the Virus, or place your
adventures in the Regency and not worry about it.

Not intending to criticise at all Jerry, but you see in CT or MT I would
always allow my characters to change careers at any point, especially if one
of the random rolls (e.g. survival) made it appropriate - nearly killed in
marines, retired to a bureaucracy desk job. Starburst for Extreme Heroism in
the Navy? Moves on to become a high ranking diplomat (if they had a career
for acting, perhaps one could move right up to being president - or maybe
that\'s the Rogue career I\'m thinking of?) :-)

My point is you either have to be flexible and adapt when GDW\'s canon stuff
doesn\'t fit things you\'ve already set up (e.g. if you\'ve already developed
parts of the Regency, etc.) or you have to wait around for them to churn out
an updated copy of the Spinward Marches supplement (note subtle sarcasm in
voice).

We\'ve heard this before from people----"I don\'t like all this technical stuff!
You guys don\'t like the game, just math!" etc, ad nasueum.  Why not *post*
something instead of lurking, then leaving in a huff because no one else
starts
the conversation *you* want to hear.  We\'re listening, _say something_.

Yeesh.  I could go on about mechanics being important in a science fiction
rpg,
but if you think it isn\'t, then post an adventure, or a character study for a
plug-in npc or something, *anything*.  A smallish group needs people to post
if
we\'re to have a range of topics covered.  Hell, even a huge USENET group can
get swamped by a single topic for a while, and that\'s with a high background
level of posting.

If you want to add something to the conversation, by all means, chime in.  If
you lurk, then leave in a huff, why would we miss you, or even care----you 
haven\'t added anything constructive.

There, now _I_ feel better.

     I agree that it would have been nice had GDW included ship design 
     information in the basic rulebook.  I remember how disappointed I was 
     back in \'92 (was it that long ago?) when I bought the book and found 
     nothing on ship design.
     
     I think, however, that the design rules as presented in FF&S and the 
     BL tech manual, are the best GDW has come up with to date.  I\'ve 
     converted a few ships I made with High Guard over 10 years ago, and 
     while you can\'t exactly do a 1-to-1 conversion, you can produce a 
     pretty good facsimile.  While I wish ships could generate about twice 
     the G-hours they do, I like the fact that GDW is finally taking a more 
     realistic look at maneuver drive fuel consumption.
     
     Just my two cents.

     Sector, Gushemege, Corridor and Vland sectors.
     
     I use \'em for my Regency campaign.  Pick up one of the old subsector 
     maker shareware packages off the net, and voila!  Instant Regency 
     guide.  Don\'t get me wrong, without the background material, it\'s not 
     as fun, but at least you have something to tie you over until Keepers 
     of the Flame comes out.
     
     I intend to vent some of my hostility to the RCES (and the 
     disproportionate amount of attention that campaign gets) by having my 
     players\' mercenary platoon blow some RCES troops away when the Regency 
     meets them in 1206!

     Yup.  It really is.  GDW needs to license someone else to put out

Comment

These are specifications for the first ship in the series, USS \'Kitty Hawk\',
later examples included on-board fuel purification and a remotely piloted
fuel scooping drone. \'Kitty Hawk\' was involved in the first jumps by Terran
humans, following the discovery of the jump drive in -2431 (AD 2087).
Following the success of unmanned probes in microjump operations within the
Terran system, Kitty Hawk was built as Terra\'s first manned starship by the
United States.  Following a number of expeditions to establish a refuelling
dump at Point Alpha (empty space at 0307 Solomani Rim).  In -2424 (AD 2094),
\'Kitty Hawk\' and her sister ships \'Santa Maria\' and \'Endeavour\' jumped into
the Barnard system, and encountered a group of Vilani prospectors searching
for lanthanum ores.

Needless to say, the encounter caused massive reaction when word got back to
Terra, and led almost immediately to the First Interstellar War.  The Kitty
Hawk was hastily converted to fire missiles from her cargo bay, and was
dispatched to secure the Prometheus system in -2423.  \'Kitty Hawk\' was lost
with all hands in action against Vilani ships in the First Battle of Sirius
(-2418).

The \'Kitty Hawk\' and her sisters were almost immediately made obselete when
the Terrans gained knowledge of gravitic technology from the Vilani.  Nine
examples were built, one survives as the centerpiece exhibit of the
Smithsonian Museum on Terra (the USS \'Republic\' was prssed into service
following the Collapse, it took a number of years to bring the ship back
into commision, but \'Republic\' served Terra faithfully during the Emergency).

The ship is a hybrid TL9/10 design, reflecting the Terran\'s ignorance of
gravitic technology prior to contact with the Vilani.  Environmental gravity
is provided by a spin hull orbiting the central cargo module.

Ah, but Robots and Secret of the Ancients and Kiunir have all been out

do for this information.  Sometimes, regurgitation can be a good thing.

But it was my understanding that GDW tried not to invalidate these
things.  I thought that what they did was sell the rights to sectors
they were never going to use and allow the individual companies to
develop those areas of space.  Likewise, I thought that they worked
very closely with DGP to make sure that their (DGP\'s) products didn\'t
contradict what GDW wanted to do.

I\'m just saying that there\'s a serious lack of material for the
Traveller of today as compared to the Traveller of yesteryear.

But maybe I don\'t want to have to fear that what I do will be
invalidated.  Or maybe I don\'t want to have to work at making things
work when they do get around to releasing it.  Or maybe I may be a new
player who hasn\'t the foggiest about how things should be in The
Regency and would really like the source material.

But sometimes you play with people who don\'t think that makes sense and

people like that anymore.  8)

I have nothing against being flexible.  I just think that it\'s a little
rediculous for them to be taking so long to release some of this stuff.
Ask me if I would have prefered to have seen them put thier resources
in Smash and Grab or Personalities of the Reformation Coalition or in a
Regency Sourcebook.  I think that they should have scraped those two
books (not because they\'re bad, I happen to like them, but because they
were inappropriate for the time that they were released) and released
sourcebooks on fleshing out the greater parts of the galaxy (Regency,
Pocket Empires, The Wilds), and then gone on to create the other two
books.  Actually, they should\'ve made the Personalities one after all
the previously aforementioned stuff and included personalities for all
aspects of the universe.

I guess the reason I\'m really cheesed off at GDW is because I went to
my local hobby store yesterday dejected because I now knew I wouldn\'t
be seeing the Regency Sourcebook anytime soon and I was still wondering
when the second RCES novel would come out.  So there I am and what do I
see?  Not one, but two products for the Star Wars RPG (yes, I play that
one too, but I don\'t like it as much as Traveller).  A whole brand new
campaign boxed set and an updated edition of two old out-of-print
adventures.

So, I\'m staring at this stuff and I\'m thinking about the wealth of Star
Wars stuff I have.  I\'m thinking about how their magazine comes out on
time while.  I\'m thinking about how I could play in almost any era in
almost any part of the SW galaxy and I\'ve got at least two sourcebooks
on the place.  I\'m thinking about the buttload of cash I\'ve dumped on
this game.  And I\'m there wishing that I could feel the same way about
Traveller.  I\'m wishing that Challenge 77 would show up.  I\'m holding
my breath for the Regency Sourcebook (so my mind\'s one-tracked).  I\'m
wondering why people are so put off by the game that even TTC is having
trouble getting lots of submissions from the fans.  I\'m thinking of the
game I\'d rather be spending my money on, except there\'s nothing for me
to buy!

A point of order, Mr. Bailey...

According to the adventure "The Strider Incident", published in
Challenge #fiftysomething (I don\'t have my collection with me), the
first Terran vessel to jump to the Barnard system was the USS
_Starleaper_ captained by Lorette Strider of the US Space Force.

This was the only adventure I wrote which saw professional
publication, so I am kind of attached to it :-)

Apart from that trivial point, a very nice article. Thank you.

Okay. Book 8 was broken. Incomprehensible, incomplete, incoherent. It was also
a rather obvious (in hindsight) test run for the DGP crew\'s vehicle design
system. You know, the one in MT.

By comparison, the robot rules in Vampire Fleets are merely inobvious and
inconclusive. They are a TOTAL rewrite which leaves out some of the esoteric
(and therefore popular) options in robot building, are a little vague about
what they _do_ cover, and which suffer from a badly abbreviated instruction
set.  What these rules cover, they cover completely.:

 The Vampire Fleets rules work (under admitedly limited circumstances); the
Book 8 rules did not work by any stretch of the imagination. Well, okay, by

Pardon me while I get a good laugh going.  I\'ve seen and posted many
discussions on story ideas and topics that have nothing to do with the
math behind the game.

So where were you then?

I too love the game for being a game rather than a tutorial for a
class.  I do concentrate on the story more than the toys (not that
building toys isn\'t fun).

So where\'s your post?

What I\'m trying to say is that I\'ve seen people who\'ve never posted
before complain that they don\'t like the contents of what\'s being
posted. 

So why don\'t you all post something?

So wild and mundane ideas that involve technology or science would be banned 
from a split off group?  Math is just another way of expressing ideas. 
Balkanizing the TML is silly.  The tech types can post tech stuff, and the non-
tech types can post non-tech stuff... interestingly, as Jerry points out, some
of the tech people do both, but the non-tech types seem to be more likely to
not post at all.

I might add that sometimes in science fiction there is some science in the 
story (Larry Niven, Bob Forward, etc. come to mind)

They don\'t have to post... change *your* posts (at least the yucky technical

Until the development of black globes, there are only a limited number of ways 
to make a craft stealthy, small size, passive sensors, EMM & decoys. The DCII
uses all of these approaches, to produce a light destroyer which has a sensor
signature little larger than a subsidised merchant. 
The design is _extremely_ tight, as fitting the desired offensive power into a 
sufficiently small hull required several compromises to be made. The biggest 
compromise is in crew accommodations, while the officers are not made to suffer 
too badly, the crew have poor quarters, with triple occupancy in bunks. 
The power plant is divided into two reactors, one which provides power for all 
the ship\'s subsystems, which is kept on line constantly, and another 
specifically for the maneuver drive, which is taken off line during jump and for 
extended station keeping. The life support is limited to the occupied volume of 
the ship, meaning vacc suits must be worn when servicing empty fuel tanks. The 
subcraft are kept in docking rings, allowing no access for maintenance while in 
space. As they are intended only for use in planetary situations, repairs as 
necessary would be performed on the ground, or at a stretch in an EVA in orbit.
Two of the ship\'s three computers are sandman viral systems, leaving only one
uninfected. This allows the crew requirement to be kept lower than it would 
otherwise be. Although when the design was first proposed there were concerns as 
to how the two viruses would interact, in the few examples which were built the 
computers actually performed marginally better as a pair, appearing to benefit 
from the \'company\', as each computer gave the other new ideas as to how to 
optimise themselves.
As well as being a significant naval force, the ship also carries two squads of 
marines (7 troopers and 1 officer per squad), and a unit of attack speeders 
(under the command of the flight officer, along with the assault lander), all of 
whom are under the command of a marine commander, responsible to the ship\'s captain.
The ship is expensive in comparison to TL14/15 designs, including the 
Broadsword, but the Century is manufactured at TL12, with fusion plants 
purchased from the Hivers or salvaged, and actually offers performance which 
compares very well to higher TL designs.
It enjoys popularity both with the RCES, who appreciate its multi-role 
capability, and mercenary units, who want to invest money in improving the unit 
without employing a crew for a second Broadsword.

Adventure Ideas:
(I\'ve already covered starship theft, unfortunately I don\'t know what digest my 
original posting appeared in)

Mutiny: Even with the operating table in the sick bay converted to a pool table, 
the accommodations for the crew are awful. It is a major task for the command
crew to keep the tension amongst the crew down to a manageable level. After
some disappointment, maybe delayed wages because an employer vanished, the crew 
finally snaps. Players could be involved on either side in the following
mess, which could involve the factions fighting for control of the critical areas
of the ship. The strains of sandman on board might get involved, or they could
just leave those crazy humans to themselves.

Murder: The atmosphere on board is very different to the shiny white corridors 
of TL15 military vessels, at TL12, with a design this tight, excess gloss can\'t 
be afforded, so the corridors are poorly lit, with tubes and cables running 
along low ceilings (think Alien/Aliens). One of the marines is a severe 
claustrophobe, and the continual closeness of the walls causes a breakdown. He 
is left with a split personality, most of the time he is completely normal, but 
occasionally, under stress or in confined spaces, he changes into a violent 
killer. This is a perfect opportunity to make your players so paranoid that they 
suspect everyone, even each other. For the ultimate twist, the killer _is_ one 
of the players, the murders happening at night, while the player was \'asleep\'. 
Tell them this and they will think that they have an alibi, then see how they
react as they begin to find evidence pointing to themselves. Do they cover it
up? At the very least it should stop the final solution to the adventure from
being a simple shoot up, after all, the players wouldn\'t shoot to kill one of
their own, would they? 
For a more tasteful adventure use a mad technician who sabotages vital ship\'s
systems while in his alternate personality.

Incompetent: The high cost of the Century means that it is sometimes purchased 
as a \'toy\' by hot-headed young businessmen with more money than sense, who want 
a more \'adventurous\' lifestyle. When a mercenary unit is formed by this hothead, 
he puts himself in command, as ship\'s captain. The results of his incompetency 
could be funny (eg. stupid missions, like being hired by one TL2 village to 
destroy the rabbit farm in the neighbouring village, and then being paid in 
loud, smelly livestock, which make conditions on board even worse), or extremely 
threatening (hey guys, lets go find out what this \'Black Sphere\' is all about). 
Given time this may well end up in a mutiny.

There, some adventure ideas. For the record, I don\'t worship maths or the 
mechanics, but equally I like being able to tweak designs at a fairly low 
level, it helps me get into the atmosphere of the game, which makes it easier to 
write adventures. I guess you just can\'t please everyone. 

I\'ve been thinking about how to produce a simplified design sequence. Maybe 
\'mini-clippers\' would be one way to do it. Hull shells could be designed using 
the basic rules, then modules could be added to fill the space. Some suggestions 
for modules would be:
thruster units (a self contained power plant, combustion chamber, fuel tank for 
50G-turns, fuel tank for the power plant) - worked out for 1G for 100ton, it 
could be multiplied up for bigger ships/accelerations
weapon units (Laser, Missiles, including necessary power plant and fuel, missile 
storage, maybe an MFD)
subcraft units (Including hangar, subcraft, flight crew accom)
sensor units (long range PEMS/AEMS, short range PEMS/AEMS, survey sensors) and so on.....

The idea would be that each would be as self contained as possible, containing 
power, fuel, possibly even crew accommodations. Standard hit charts could be 
worked out for each module, like clipper modules, and then the overall damage
chart could be worked out like the clipper. The final result would not actually 
be a clipper, because the modules would be considered a permanent part of the
ship.

Although this might help with design, it would make it even messier in play, as 
hundreds of charts would be needed. Perhaps Scott Nolan could be more specific 
with what he dislikes about the design sequences, then we can try to work out a 
way to help. If the whole thing seems too daunting, then the forms in the 
Players\' Forms book might help you organise a design.

             ***Olga and the Spambots!***

Olga Stokova is a free trader operating in the wilds. As well as operating 
standard trade she also operates a \'dating service\' on the side. She offers 
passage to young women from the wilds, with their tickets paid for by citizens 
of the RCES, hoping for love and romance. Most often they are stood up as soon 
as their future partners reach Coalition space, but Olga has already collected 
the money for the passage, ensuring her a steady flow of work. To drum up
interest in her service, she has acquired an AI advertising probe, which, 
infected by virus, has acquired an even stranger personality than before.....

Somewhere at the edge of the Aubaine system a small jump capsule burst out of
jumpspace, tumbling over and over. A carefully executed corrective burst from a 
maneuver jet set it spinning even faster in another direction. Unfortunately the 
ships computer knew no words suitable for this situation, so it began to search 
its database for an expression.
\'These are Damn fine opportunities\' it printed. This didn\'t seem right, so it
thought for a moment and then tried again.
\'Damn these fine opportunities\'. It sat back smugly, and went back to solving
the navigation problem. After several more failed burns the ship\'s computer gave 
up and tried firing the main engines whenever the ship was pointing in the right 
direction. After a few hours the computer stopped the engines and shut down the 
main fusion plant, satisfied that it would probably hit the mainworld somewhere.

A few days later a meteor was seen to come down in the ocean near the shipyards 
on Aubaine. The probe opened up its cargo bay and dispatched two black shapes
before sinking slowly to the bottom of the ocean, where it sank into the mud.

Enter our heros:
The characters wake up one morning to find their mail terminal overloaded with 
junkmail, which should have been filtered out by the postal system. All the 
junkmail (which has cost each character Cr100 to download) are adverts for 
\'Olga\'s dating services\' Make sure the players know how much the junk mail cost 
them, and that postnet is responsible. Do whatever is necessary to get them into 
a righteous fury, have a message on the screen inform them that messages from
lovers/lottery offices/employers messages were returned to sender
due to the volume of junk mail held.

At postNET:
As the characters walk to the local postNET office to complain they will notice 
that projection billboards are also showing adverts like the ones in their 
postbox. Even innocent municipal garbagebots have begun sweeping the litter into 
words. At the postNET office a giant surging crowd blocks the doorway for the
players. If the players are to be able to make their
complaint before closing time, they need to find a way past the crowd. Bluffing, 
acting, and blowing alternative entrances with heavy ordinance are all 
acceptable methods of entry. Inside, the receptionist stares blankly into space. 
At the character\'s approach he looks up, stiffly, with an audible whirr and 
click. The players need to pass Easy:Observation tasks to realise that this is a 
robot, in appearance it looks human, but its mannerisms give it away. The robot 
will answer their questions in the most transparent way - \'What is wrong with
the mail? I did not alter the mail. It was not me who redirected subgrid filter 
two to enable this post. I did not enter this building and break into the 
secured areas of the computer cores to
send the mail.\' The players should be about to take violent action when a human 
employee walks in, saying \'Oh, Stan, what do these people want then?\' - \'They 
want to know about the junk mail, Dave\'. Dave will try to assist the characters, 
but he has no idea what caused it. If the characters suggest that Stan did it, 
or that Stan is a robot, Dave will resolutely disbelieve them. Dave will not 
respond to logical arguments, only a physical attack on the robot will cause it 
to reveal it\'s true nature. If the players don\'t try this, and are getting very 
annoyed, eg. threatening you with violence, then the real Stan walks in and Dave 
will realise - \'Stan? But....if you\'re Stan......then who\'s?..........\'
When attacked or found out in this way, the robot will stand up abruptly, its
eyes flashing red. \'Must terminate opposition - Must continue mission - Must 
advertise\'. Dozens of little panels on its forearms open up and various sharp
pointy bits spring out. The robot\'s designer obviously intended this to be 
scary, but unfortunately it looks more like a Swiss army knife, it\'s case not
being helped by one of the spikes, which can be positively identified as the 
thing for getting stones out of horses hooves. (I\'ve only just got Vampire 
Fleets, and it doesn\'t seem too good for anthropomorphic robots, so...) Use 
whatever template NPC seems most suitable, improve it\'s combat abilities a bit, 
let the players blow it up.

All is quiet for a few days, then Olga herself jumps insystem. Once she has 
landed at the starport there are plenty of opportunities for players to get involved:
-Security work, protecting her ship from angry crowds. Why should they? Double 
wages maybe?
-If the players can\'t be bought then maybe they could try to sneak into the 
starport to graffiti their feelings on the side of Olga\'s ship, or reprogram 
maintenance robots to do it for them.
Or if they\'re desperate
-Paying for Olga\'s services.

Next day, on another free trader, a young farmer from the wilds arrives, 
claiming that his fiance was kidnapped by Olga. This could develop in several ways
-She was kidnapped, Olga is involved in slavery and needs to be investigated.

Perhaps characters could get work aboard her ship to gather evidence, if some of 
her crew accidentally were told to go to the wrong launch bay in the
starport. 
The girl also needs to be rescued from some evil business type in a fortress.
-As above, but the girl actually prefers her new life
-As the first, but although the girl is unhappy, she was also unhappy in the 
wilds, and she disliked her future husband, so she agreed to go with Olga 
willingly at first.

Olga will manage to getaway from Aubaine, although she is fined Cr1000 for 
misuse of public messaging systems. If the players feel this injust, then they 
can track her into the wilds and try to apprehend her for slavery, drugs or some 
other questionable trade.

And what happened to the second Spambot?

Congratulations in advance to anyone who actually manages to make an
adventure of this.

Exactly, and I suppose I should have been more clear in the beginning.  We
know he was in the area (he found humans, after all), and was interested
in the subject.

Yes.  It would be very interesting to compare and contrast, unfortuanately
other than the "One of Our Star Systems is Missing" plotline, I can\'t think
of a good reason to insert it into a Traveller campaign.

Good.  We haven\'t had this rant and rave in ... oh, it must be a year.  ;-)

Wouldn\'t it have made at least as much sense included in Striker II?
I wouldn\'t mind the miniatures rules, except that there were other things
(like starship fuel consumption) that would have been a better use of the
space.

More like 18; I counted.  It would have cost about the space devoted to
one of the sample adventures (IMHO, it would have been space well spent).

Please don\'t get me wrong on this point - for all of it\'s flaws, FF&S is
probably the best product in the whole T:TNE lineup.  It does deliver on
what was promised of it, and the omissions (there are some) don\'t harm
it\'s utility.

GURPS has rough equivalents, but not a direct equivalent.
3G3 has better small arms design sequences, but that\'s all 3G3 covers.

No, you shouldn\'t have - that, like a few rule updates that were in the RCES
Equipment Guide, should have been included in FF&S.  On the other hand, if
they had included it in FF&S, you wouldn\'t have a reason to have to buy
Vampire Fleets.

Perhaps GDW is hoping that if they delay producing it long enough, the
demand for it will go away?

The folks who are doing the Star Wars RPG have the staffing, the time, and
the money to do the work right - high production values, frequent releases,
and generally good, tight material.  Part of it is that Lucasfilm insists on
high-quality material from their liscencees, and part of it is that the
product quality does directly affect the bottom line.  GDW seems unwilling
or unable to achieve, let alone maintain, those kind of standards.

> If GDW didn\'t cover it, someone else did.

That is aparrently the way that GDW wants it.

Exactly.  By looking at shelf space allocations in my hobby store, I can see
that GDW\'s products aren\'t moving well.  While it may be a bit more
expensive to Do Things Right, it\'s even more expensive to do a poor job.
Not only does that cut sales of current products, but it chips away at the
sales of future products as well.

As opposed to Traveller:2300?  ;-)

Okay, this may sound dumb, but could somebody out there please send me
a worksheet for any starship that they\'ve created.

I\'m looking to create a starship or two and I\'m running into a few
problems.  I\'ve cheated by using the examples in FFS to help me out 
when I\'m creating weapons, but no such luck with starships.

Likewise, any tips and tricks are greatly appreciated.  For example,
what are the best systems to knock out of the way first?  What should I

    'body' => 'As many of you probably know, I\'m one of the people interested in "numbers"
and science in Traveller, and I thought I\'d weigh in with a few opinions
on this debate.

First and foremost, there\'s no reason you have to use FF&S or any other
set of Traveller rules.  Like any other RPG, and any other set of rules,
they\'re just suggestions, to be used or ignored as you see fit.  I\'ve found
that the most enjoyable role-playing sessions are the ones in which the
rules get used the least.

Many referees are quite successful with the "TLAR" method of creating
technical details: "That Looks About Right".  Anything from star maps to
world creation, to starships and technical gadgets are fair game for
the referee\'s imagination.  Create what stats you think are appropriate
for it, and just go.

If this is how you prefer to work, and can keep the details straight from
session to session (either in your memory, or written down in a campaign
notebook) then there\'s no problem with it!  This is, in fact, the way that
many SF writers work, and how most SF television scripts get written.  The
major thing to watch out for is inconsistency.  Players will expect that
their gizmos and gadgets will perform as advertised, unless there\'s a good
reason to think otherwise, and may give you a hard time about inexplicable
changes.

Another approach which works is to draft your players into doing much of
the work.  Most groups contain at least one person who think FF&S is "neat"
and will (if you let them) happily spend time between gaming sessions
designing all sorts of gadgets for you.  Cultivate this person, and give
him or her ideas on the sort of thing you\'d like to see written up for
your game universe.  Building a whole universe is a big job for one person,
and it\'s a lot more managable when you have help.  It can also have
role-playing benefits: if the player who designed your Imperial Star Navy is
playing a character who used to be a Navy drive engineer, it\'s quite
reasonable that he should know Navy ships "like the back of his hand".

Finally, I\'d like to talk about the role of the TML in these sorts of
discussions.  I see the TML as a forum for discussing just about anything
Traveller-related.  We\'ve already split the list once, to have the TML which
is for T:TNE and other "New Era" topics, while XBOAT is devoted to the
"Classic" era.  I don\'t see a need for further divisions - TML and XBOAT
are both small enough that skipping uninteresting articles isn\'t an
onerous chore, and the balance of articles seems reasonable.  I don\'t see a
preponderance of technical versus non-technical articles (of course, this
means that people who are only interested in one type of article are going
to report that they see "too many" of the other type).


-In a sense, there already is a list for mind-numbing number-crunching
posts and detailed design sequence examinations.  The GDW-Beta list exists
for just this sort of thing, and has been very UNDER-utilized in recent
months.  There\'s virtually no traffic on it.

History

The Keats Class fighter was developed in 1117 in the Spinward Marches for 
shipping escort, to counter the growing threat from Vargr corsairs. Due to its 
low cost it was soon produced in great numbers, and larger Keats squadrons were 
employed in discouraging Aslan colonisation. As the design began to see service 
outside the Marches, it was even employed against smaller cruisers, the sheer
number of Keats overwhelming the MFDs and sandcaster batteries of their 
opponents, and removing any critical target for a cruisers spinal weapon to be 
used efficiently against. The high maneuverability, reasonable armour and small 
size of the Keats improved its survivability, but nonetheless the Keats size 
made it fairly fragile, and casualties were high. However, the casualties were 
little higher than those suffered by squadrons with larger ships, as forces of 
Keats fighters lost far fewer crew per ship destroyed.
The design is employed widely in the New Era by Regency Quarantine, as its 
armament is sufficient to tackle most vessels up to 1000 tons if used in 
sufficient numbers, and force sizes can be scaled easily by redeploying more 
fighters to systems where they are needed. The high acceleration means that the 
fighters can outrun, or intercept, almost all pre-collapse designs, and a 
fighter squadron covers a system\'s jump points far better than a smaller number 
of patrol cruisers or SDBs.

Design notes

The life support does not include the fuel tankage. 
8G acceleration was actually the result of a slight miscalculation in the thrust 
needed, but when I found out, I decided to keep it, just to break through the 6G 
barrier which has hung on from Megatraveller days.
The laser lances are not gravitically focused. At TL-13+ X-Ray lasers make it
possible to produce effective non grav lasers. The advantage of this is the 
energy efficiency of the system - the non grav lance needs an input energy of
around 820MJ, compared to the 3500MJ input energy for a grav focused laser of
the same energy. The non grav laser does have a poorer range, and requires a 
much larger focal array, bringing the cost up significantly, but requires a much 
smaller HPG, saving space, and uses less power. 20 hexes is about the maximum
range practical before the cost of the focal array becomes ridiculous. The use 
of non grav focused lasers makes it possible for the Keats to carry lasers with 
a total discharge energy greater than the Gazelle close escort. Although the 
cost of the weapon is greater, the ship needed to mount it is smaller, so 
overall, there are significant reductions in cost.

For those who want to use the laser lance in their own designs:
SA = 28.3m^2, power = 4.575MW, mass = 80.45, volume = 51.62, Cost =  MCr6.855

There are enough people here who _like_ designing that I\'m certain you could

Actually, you don\'t need to be a math or engineering graduate to design
stuff; in fact, you don\'t even need a computer.  My high school students have
no trouble designing ships and weapons using FFS.  My friend George MacLure
designed the Sydkai patrol cruiser (MegaTraveller Journal 3) using pencil and
paper, not a spreadsheet.  

Some grammatical notes:

1) "The attraction of the original games was it\'s" - disagreement between
object and verb (should be "original game was its" or "original games were
their"); also, "it\'s" is a contraction for "it is", not a possessive

2) "the rules where secondary" - you mean "the rules were secondary", and you
should have some punctuation separating this clause from the preceeding one.

3) "which seams to pervail" - should be "which seems to prevail"

4) Frequent misuse of subordinate clauses noted.

I\'d like to jump in on the Techhead vs. Gamer debate that seems to be slowly
fanning itself up to full flame.

I personally think this is one of the most useful gaming resources on the
entire net.  Not just for Trav, but for any sci-fi game.  I\'ll happily admit
that some of the number crunching goes beyond my level of interest, but that
just helps me pull off the "That Looks About Right" approach someone
mentioned earlier.  Do I really care to have equations for the velocity of
jump launched killer rocks?  Not really, and my players don\'t miss it, but
just seeing the discussion and hard science involved helps inspire me.  Being
able to suck the brains of the truly science inclined makes my game more
realistic without making me get bogged down in details I don\'t really care
for.

If you\'re more of a creative type it may be productive to look at the
technical discussions as an ends to a means.  The mind-numbing number
crunching answers the questions that help to define a SF game word: Why does
a culture do this?  Why does this custom exist?  Why *aren\'t* killer rocks
the ultimate weapon?  My god, you\'re being handed incredible amounts of
technical material!  Use that solid foundation of hard fact to build the
details that make your game interesting.

Larry Niven once said that his best ideas came from coming up an interesting
premise, crunching the numbers, and finding out it wouldn\'t work.  Mistakes
in his original assumptions forced him to explain the problems in "Ringworld"
by writing the superior "Ringworld Engineers".  Now it seems he\'ll explain
the existing problems with the relationship between humanity, the Pak, and
Ringworld in the forthcoming "Ringworld Throne".  All because he discovered
 fundamental flaws in his math or reasoning that only came to light after
vigorous discussion.  Hell, he\'s building a career out of creatively
correcting his mistakes!

On the related issue of why T:TNE hasn\'t caught on with the general gaming
public I have a couple of theories.  One cause is the incredible dryness of
the source material.  Someone needs to seriously rebuild the main rulebook
and inject a little life into it as soon as possible.  A nice graphic
makeover and the addition of good prose introductions would make introducing
new players to the setting a lot easier.  I\'d actually like to see White Wolf
take a crack at it. B-)

Strangely enough I think the rules have also regressed.  Back in the 80\'s
when rules intensive gaming was big Trav had a nice, loose system that left a
lot up to the Ref.  Now that nice, loose systems have become the big thing in
the 90\'s GDW comes out with a rule set that would have been right at home in
the 80\'s.  The kids today (God, I\'m not even thirty and I\'m saying that.)
just get intimidated by all the tables and charts at first glance.  Yet
another reason for reviving classic Trav.

Lastly, gamers tend to have addictive personalities.  If they don\'t get a
regular fix of new material they move on to something that will offer them
the constant stimulation they crave.  That\'s the reason Magic went boffo and
why other, IMHO inferior games, have taken off.  There has been a noticable
lack of support for GDW projects, the demise of Dark Conspiracy and lack of
Trav stuff being prime examples, that I feel has put the company on a
downward spiral.  I truly hope they\'ll recover, but I have very serious
doubts.  I\'d even be willing to forgive them cashing in on the CCG craze with
a Traveller version if I thought it would give them the cash to get things
moving again.  Now that I think about it I actually kinda like the idea of a
Traveller card game.  Hmmm....

Cordially,
MM

Andy Lilly ;-)

(and meant in the nicest possible sense as a small piece of light relief
from the pressures of reality - any flames please respond personally and
don\'t hassle other TMLers. Not meant as a dig at James at all, I just had 10
minutes to spare and found my fingers wandering...).

CONGRATULATIONS AND A GENTLE PROD

I\'d also like to congratulate Brendan on his post in 362 which managed to
combine a ship design with some interesting adventure plots. Better still
"Olga" in 363 - I\'d been trying to think of an amusing way to point out what
stupid sh*ts I think these spam-mailers are.

When Jerry and co say "Stand up and contribute" they do have a point - the
TML always goes through phases but in the past there have been some very
good _little_ ideas proposed. Anyone want to do an updated (TNE) version of
the Hitch-hiker\'s Guide career? Anyone got 76-Patron type adventures? NPCs -
it only has to be a few lines write-up. What happened in your recent game
that caused you to laugh? Great quotes of our times... The point is, make it
short and snappy because you don\'t have the time to write a lot, most
TMLer\'s don\'t have the time to read a lot. If it gets too long for a post,
consider sending it to a magazine (after all, they seem pretty desperate for
Traveller articles at the moment - Traveller Chronicle, Signal-GK, Valkyrie,
Challenge, etc.).

NB: As soon as I know which of my submitted stuff is in TTC 8, I\'ll post the
other bits to TML. Just putting my ASCII where my mouth is! :-)

     If your astrogator made the mistake of plotting his course for the 
     "habitable" zone of the Jae Tellona system, don\'t chastise him too 
     severely when you arrive in an asteroid belt. Jae Tellona, the system 
     mainworld, is located one orbit into the outer zone of the system.
     
     When settlers originally came to Jae Tellona (ca. 230), they made the 
     same mistake.  The small flotilla of settlers from Gushemege Sector 
     arrived in system to stake their claims only to find they were in the 
     middle of the system\'s solitary asteroid belt.  Thinking they had been 
     suckered by a corrupt colonial-office tree-kraken-oil salesman, the 
     angry settlers prepared to embark upon the long and costly flight home 
     across The Rift to collect some payback.  Fortunately, a crewmember on 
     one of the ships took a closer look at the system charts and 
     discovered their folly.
     
     Even at this distance, Jae Tellona\'s average temperature remains in a 
     survivable range because of the absence of large oceans on Jae 
     Tellona\'s arid surface.  Because there are no oceans present to cool 
     the planet, the energy of Dikaai, the system\'s solitary subgiant star, 
     is conserved rather well.  Oddly enough, if a planet with Jae 
     Tellona\'s hydrosphere were in this system\'s habitable zone, the 
     temperature would be infernally high and render colonization next to 
     impossible.
     
     Jae Tellona\'s original settlers came from Gushemege\'s rimward edge.  
     This region was particularly hard hit by The Long Night.  The peoples 
     of the region were eager to ply the lanes of interstellar space 
     looking for a better opportunity after centuries of hardship and 
     subjugation at the hands of more populated and technologically 
     advanced worlds.
     
     The Jae Tellonan settlers were the descendents of mixed 
     Vilani-Solomani stock.  Their Vilani blood came predominantly from 
     several warrior caste worlds of the old Vilani Empire, including 
     Answerin.  During the Interstellar Wars, several roughriding Terran 
     squadrons were sent into the region to do battle with the Vilani.  
     After peace was made, many of them stayed.  The hybrid of the two 
     cultures featured some of the best characteristics of both human 
     strains.  The settlers who were to become the Jae Tellonans were known 
     for their Answerin fearlessness as well as the frontier spirit of 
     their Terran ancestors.
     
     While colonizing a desert world is a dismal proposition for some, the 
     Jae Tellonan settlers welcomed the challenge.  In christening their 
     world, the settlers chose the name of an inspirational Gushemegan 
     military leader who helped guide the people of the Gushemegan colonies 
     through the waning years of the Long Night and into the Twilight Era.
     
     The Jae Tellonans learned to maximize their use of the planet\'s 
     limited moisture resources.  In addition, they learned to distill 
     water from the skimmed atmosphere of Uunkida Gar, the gas giant Jae 
     Tellona orbits.  It therefore comes as no surprise that Uunkida Gar is 
     named for one of Vland\'s largest oceans, considering its primary use 
     for the Jae Tellonans.
     
     While the Jae Tellonan colonists held a commonality of purpose, they 
     could never completely overcome their militaristic roots.  Descended 
     from spacefaring soldiers, the clannish colonists found themselves 
     splintering into opposed camps.  Soon warfare began to break out 
     between the clans.  By 350, the warfare between the clans became so 
     severe, Jae Tellona\'s population began to experience a sharp drop, at 
     one point even dipping into pre-colonization levels.  The number of 
     young men and women began to dwindle to the point that they could no 
     longer sustain the population growth necessary for a colony to 
     continue to grow and prosper.
     
     It was then that Makhid Jellosonar, a general of the Hyosonuri clan, 
     went to the Duke of Rhylanor for help.  Jellosonar invited 
     intervention by the Rhylanori to quell the discontent at home.  At 
     first, Rhylanor was loathe to accept the offer.  While Jellosonar was 
     the most powerful warlord on Jae Tellona, he was the only one to come 
     to Rhylanor for help.  The resistance, bred for desert fighting, might 
     be strong and Rhylanor had no desire to become embroiled in a 
     prolonged conflict.  Jellosonar sweetened the deal by offering a 
     lucrative trade pact to Rhylanor provided they help to establish him 
     as the solitary ruler of the planet.  Rhylanor accepted and dispatched 
     military advisors to help Jellosonar conquer the enemy clans and bring 
     them under his wing.  Using advanced Rhylanori weaponry, he succeeded.
     
     Since that time, Jae Tellona has existed under nearly a millenium of 
     military rule.  The Jae Tellonans, used to a hard life, willingly 
     submit to the fiat of a central ruler.  The central ruler is drawn 
     from the general ranks of Jae Tellona\'s army.  No pretense of 
     pluralism exists on the planet.  The ruler is referred to as "general 
     commandant" by the citizenry.  The general\'s hierarchy of staff 
     officers provide the network by which he rules the system.  Each 
     general commandant is elected by his peers in the Jae Tellonan army.  
     Election of a general commandant is not taken lightly, as he rules for 
     life once appointed.
     
     Staff generals are appointed to cities and territories by the general 
     commandant.  The native city or region of a staff general has no 
     bearing on his appointment.  In fact, staff generals are usually 
     appointed to regions that are not their native element.  The Jae 
     Tellonans believe this promotes unity and dissipates clan 
     ethnocentricity.
     
     One element of Jellosonar\'s trade agreement with Rhylanor that 
     continues to this day is the "Rashakhra Provision."  The Rashakhras 
     are Jae Tellonan soldiers conscripted into the Rhylanori military 
     services as commandos.  They are trained on Jae Tellona and known as 
     one of the toughest, most disciplined military units in the Regency.  
     The number of conscripts is limited based on current population levels 
     so as not to upset the balance or personnel numbers of Jae Tellona\'s 
     army.  Though many Jae Tellonans have come to resent this provision, 
     for most it is considered an honor to serve among the Rashakhra ranks.
     
     The delicate balance of peace between the clans is maintained by the 
     checks and balances of a system that could best be described as a 
     draconian feudal technocracy.  The military ranks controlled by the 
     general commandant consist of carefully mixed clan blocs so as to 
     prevent any one clan from obtaining a controlling majority of a 
     military unit.  Each clan bloc is privy to a large stock of 
     top-of-the-line Rhylanori military technology, enabling them to hold 
     power by the sheer potential force of their ranks.  While some of the 
     old clan conflicts continue to simmer to this day, the historical 
     threat of self-destruction and the strength of the general commandant 
     maintains the peace.
     
     Jae Tellona\'s novelty tech level is of particular importance since it 
     reflects the military technology level.  While domestically 
     manufactured weapons, sensors and computers may be purchased by the 
     general populace for commercial and self defense purposes, only the 
     military is allowed use of imported high-tech weaponry and 
     electronics.  The Jae Tellonan military trades with only two preferred 
     partners:  Rhylanor and Porozlo.
     
     The above description may give the wandering traveller the impression 
     that Jae Tellona is a powder keg waiting to blow.  Just the opposite 
     is true, however.  Jae Tellona maintains a remarkably harmonious 
     society.  While the planet is technically under military rule, this is 
     more out of tradition than necessity.  Jellosonar\'s unification of the 
     Jae Tellonan clans was looked upon as a paradigm shift in the history 
     of the planet.  The military was not looked upon as an oppressor, but 
     rather a liberator, freeing the citizenry from the self-imposed prison 
     of perpetual war.
     
     The military is actually proportionately smaller than those of most 
     other Regency systems.  The revered training and discipline of a Jae 
     Tellonan battalion, however, makes them the equal of most Regency army 
     brigades.  At age 17, all Jae Tellonans are conscripted into the army 
     and are taught, in addition to basic weapons, tactics and fighting 
     skills, the tenets of civil defense and desert warfare.  The length of 
     conscription is one term.  Many Jae Tellonans opt to remain in the 
     military for a second term, but for the most part, the only "lifers" 
     in the Jae Tellonan military are those who become Rashakhras.
     
     Jae Tellona\'s populace for the most part thrives on trade, producing 
     components and materials for many offworld industries.  The Jae 
     Tellonan silicon industry, for instance, claims to cut more silicon 
     than the rest of the subsector\'s worlds combined.  Indeed, Jae 
     Tellona\'s main specialization is the production of military-grade 
     silicon components.
     
     Jae Tellonans take pride when they see their part in the greater 
     scheme of things.  While the planet\'s pre-stellar TL-8 doesn\'t allow 
     them to compete with neighbors Rhylanor and Porozlo in most 
     industries, Jae Tellonan craftmanship and attention to detail is 
     respected subsectorwide.
     
     As a leading exporter of many technological components, Jae Tellona is 
     resented by many other systems in the subsector for their trade 
     surplus.  Jae Tellona ships a great deal, but is rather stingy on 
     importation for several reasons.  First and foremost is the 
     aforementioned trade limitations imposed by the general commandant.  
     Second is the culture of the Jae Tellonans themselves.  Accustomed to 
     hardship and relatively few material comforts, Jae Tellonans simply 
     don\'t demand many consumer products.  They work hard, play hard and 
     enjoy travelling the wild outbacks of their harsh and unforgiving 
     world, but they don\'t buy much in the way of entertainment, fashion or 
     leisure products.
     
     Because of this, Jae Tellona is frequently at the center of TNS 
     financial news pieces.  They have been subjected to numerous economic 
     sanctions in the past from other systems in Rhylanor Subsector, but 
     maintain their monolithic stance and show no signs of abating their 
     aggressive trade policies.
     
     Hyosonuri Starport, located in the industrial city of Dan Mokheidi, is 
     a meticulously maintained and highly functional starport, albeit a bit 
     small.  A large portion of the starport is allotted to Jae Tellona\'s 
     government-controlled freighter fleet and small but efficient SDB 
     squadron.  Eight ports are reserved for offworlder starships.
     
     The seat of government lies in the small and seemingly provincial city 
     of Brokari Ai.  Located next to one of the planet\'s few permanent 
     oases, Brokari Ai is more a military base than a city, though a fairly 
     large commercial sector exists to serve the needs of the general 
     commandant\'s brigade.
     
     Offworlders will find Jae Tellonans surprisingly friendly and 
     forthcoming.  They criticize their leaders quite freely and without 
     fear of reprisal.  Casual observers and self-proclaimed civic experts 
     attribute the unwillingness to overthrow the government to a general 
     malaise or complacency on the part of the Jae Tellonan masses.  Those 
     who are so misinformed fail to remember that Jae Tellonans are 
     descendants of Vilani military castes.  Committed to duty and 
     efficiency, the Jae Tellonans subscribe the old addage, "If it ain\'t 
     broke, why fix it?"
     
     Their society, under military rule, prospers to a degree that the Jae 
     Tellonan populace finds satisfactory.  Most see no reason to alter the 
     system or liberate the government, thereby risking a return to the 
     bloody days of old.
     
     Jae Tellonans, for the most part, are dark skinned with black or dark 
     brown hair.  Their eye colors have a much greater natural range, with 
     hazel, amber and light brown being the most common.  Jae Tellonans, 
     due to their ascetic lifestyles, are rarely overweight.  Poor physical 
     condition is taboo in Jae Tellonan culture.  "The gluttonous man," it 
     is said in Jae Tellonan proverbs, "has drawn too long on the well that 
     nourishes us all."

Quite true.  For one reason or another, I\'ve never bothered to computerize
any of the FF&S design sequences.  While it is more time-consuming (2 to 4
hours per design) than with Classic Book 5 (which took me between 30 and 60
minutes a design), it\'s feasable to design a FF&S starship with nothing but
pencil, paper, and a pocket calculator.

OK, my pocket calculator is an HP-41CX, but _still_ ...  :-)

The graphic treatment in T:TNE is a bit better than that in Survival Margin,
but I must confess, rather reminds me of someone\'s first or second attempt
at laying out a document with a new Macintosh.

It really is true - less is more.  Good typography and layout will make
the rules seem easier to read and more straightforward (of course, some
proofreading, editing, and crossreferencing would work wonders, too).

I\'d dearly love to see a _Classic Traveller: 20th Anniversary Edition_ on
the shelves for 1997.  How \'bout it folks?

I think you\'ve got a point here - nobody has a monopoly on good ideas, and
the best periods in the history of Traveller were when there were several
liscencees working on the game.  In the very early days, there was Paranoia
Press and FASA releasing some quite creative suppliments (does anybody
remember the LeHP(Or) series computers?) and adventures (The _Sky Raiders_
trilogy still tops my list of "Best Role-Playing Adventures of All Time").

Very true!  But I see another lesson in the current collectable card game
craze: QUALITY products _can_ make an impression, even in a crowded and
competitive market.  In particular, I\'m referring to Steve Jackson Games [*]
and I:NWO.

Unfortunately, I\'m personally very afraid that GDW would do too little, too
late.  The collectable trading-card genre has gotten _very_ crowded in the
last six months, and from past performance, it seems all too likely that
GDW would enter the market as the boom goes bust; and with a product that
(while based on an interesting, or even highly original idea) was so
insufficently developed, proofread, or playtested as to be more annoying
than fun in actual play.


[*] Regular readers of TML might notice that I refer to SJ games a _lot_;
it\'s not because of some secret agenda - it\'s because I feel that Frank
Chadwick and his game company could learn a great deal from Steve Jackson. 
Both are talented game designers who have a number of Good Ideas.  However
GDW has, over the last 5 to 10 years, proven unwilling or unable to develop
them into quality products.  SJ Games, on the other hand, seems to believe
that their customers care about quality products, and take the time to
develop their ideas into solid, very playable, and very enjoyable games.
The latest case-in-point being Illuminati: New World Order; SJ Games has
put a product into the increasingly-crowded collectable trading-card game
market and proven that they have a Good Idea, executed very well (I:NWO won
"Best Card Game" at this years Origins, and I understand that I:NWO sales
have been breaking records down in Austin since the game was announced).
Quality shows, and quality sells games (or anything else, for that matter).

No, GDW-Beta isn\'t defunct ... though there\'s been no traffic on it for
a while.  I administer the list ... originally, I invited a few of the
most prolific "number-crunchers" to join.  Since then, I\'ve added everyone
who has requested to join the list.  IF at some point the mail volume
becomes excessive for QRC.COM, I may have to restrict membership to control
the load on our mail server (QRC.COM couldn\'t, for example, handle the

and to date I\'ve only removed names from the list in cases where the
account has been deleted or otherwise became invalid.

Send me e-mail and ask to be added.  (Or you can send e-mail to
GDW-Beta-request@qrc.com, which is effectively the same thing).

I heard some complaining in #364 about the lack of "life" (was that it?)
in TNE, and I agree that some nice italicized narrative a la Twilight:2000
would be nice.  I find the personal insight stuff from RCES team members
to be very motivational, point in case is The Toast...  However, the "life"
is what each of us as Refs, should bring to the Game...

Who was it that said his starmap of Diaspora was wrong, because it still had
all the old data on it, starport types A, etc?  I believe it was one of you
"techies" (Freudian analysis omitted) who failed to READ THE FINE PRINT.
It\'s in the upper right hand corner.  \'Says somethin\' \'bout supposed t\'be

NOT always a GDW snafu; sometimes it is intentional.  (I\'m not sure why I 
remembered this, but looking up at my laminated wall map of Diaspora brought
back that adab memory.  I am glad that the map is old.  I catch my players
looking at it now and then. :) )

BTW, I want to personally that all the "technies", you math lovers you, for
sharing with us all your designs, data, and technobabble discussions, as
MorninMan pointed out, they have been inspirational.  :)  (Er, that that up
yonder should\'ve been a THANK, Mr. Prior.)  Thank you, again.

OTHO, Magic et al. are about to go bust due to a new Europe only marketing

A close structure MIGHT be like the gunstar (?) in "The Last 
starfighter" (going by memory, it\'s been a loooong time...).

As for a slab, I don\'t realy know, but it might be very long and wide 
in comparison to it\'s height. eg an orbital platform (say 10m thick 
and 100-400m square, life support etc inside, external modules, 
docking ships etc attached to the outside).

Hope this helps

Okay, so I\'m not too sure why they consider some things wedge.  To be
honest, when I look at a far trader, I think slab first.  Oh well,
Maybe this is one of those Ask Commodore Bwana questions.  I just wish
he would answer on this list.  8)

As for examples:

close structure  Donosev-Class Survey Ship
                 Chrysanthemum-Class Destroyer Escort

open structure   Aurora-Class Clipper

slab             Shukugan-Class System Defense Boat
                 Bastien-Class Subsidized Liner
                 
All of the above are taken from Brilliant Lances...

Okay, now here\'s my take (which is probably all wrong anyway 8).  Close
structure ships are ones that have no business being considered any
other type of hull.   They are the ones that are just the funky shapes
or the combination of shapes.  Open structure are just a little more
`open\' for interpretation (pun intended).  Actually, they could almost
fit into another category, but because of their hodge-podge of pieces,
shape, etc. aren\'t.  And the slab.  It\'s just not stylish enough to be
a wedge.  Either the nose and hull don\'t have enough curves, or
something (honestly, I\'m still fuzzy as to some of GDW\'s decisions). 
Basically, it looks like a brick with engines.

ELECTRO-MAG CATAPULTS

(As an aside) There was an interesting Star Trek scenario (adaptable to
Traveller) which concerned the takeover of such a facility.

Could you post the stats for your facility? In my "high-level" campaign, I
envisioned an orbital refinery which would circle a gas giant, shooting fuel
pods off to the system\'s mainworld via a mass driver catapult. I created the
refinery, but never got around to creating the catapult.

Also, do you have data on the speed of the projectiles? We just assumed that it
would take 6-8 months before the first shipments arrived, and after that you
would have a steady flow of _refined_ fuel travelling to your homeworld.

TNE vs CT/MT FAQ

In Digest 292, James Dempsey wrote:
>The draft FAQ is now also on the web. Try http://www.spirit.com.au/~jamesd

Thank you to Harold Hale for suggesting it, and to James Dempsey for putting up
the FAQ (sorry for being late in saying thank you). Could I suggest that Derek
Wildstar\'s <wildstar@qrc.com> commentary about TNE be re-worked and placed into
the FAQ? It was a good general summary of TNE vs earlier Traveller systems - and
was a FAQ in itself. The text is found in Digest 289.

JUMP FIGHTER

Much more recently (Digest 363), Brendan O\'Donovan posted a "jump fighter".
Now, I have looked thru my rules and there is nothing specific which rules
out sub-100t starships. The nearest thing is a throw-away definition in
Brilliant Lances which defines small craft as those craft under 100t AND
without jump drives, and so they cannot jump to other systems.

However, there is nothing which says that the minimum size for a starship
is 100t - a BIG change from the old rules. My players KNEW that you could
put jump drives into small craft, even in MT or HG (that is, there is
enough room for them), but the "min. 100t rule" was in effect.

Has this rule been lifted for TNE??

Note that the Clipper is "open" when unloaded, and "close"
when loaded (can anyone say _Space: 1999_ "Eagles"?!).

Close structures generally seem to be designs which are
a couple of boxes stuck together by tubes, bits of wire, etc.

If you look carefully at the descriptions, there are really three "sets"
of gear involved here:

* Flight Avionics
  These are instruments that tell the pilot what the vehicle is doing in
  relation to the ground.  For example, how high the vehicle is, which
  direction it\'s pointing in, how fast it\'s going, and whether or not there
  is something in the way.
  If you\'re going to be flying by VFR (Visual Flight Rules - clear
  weather only), you don\'t need these.  Otherwise, don\'t leave them out
  of the design: these are the "instruments" for IFR (Instrument Flight
  Rules - non visual flying conditions).
  In many cases, knowing where you are (in a local sense) will give you
  navigational information, but that\'s not the real purpose of these
  instruments.
  Good current-day examples of Flight Avionics would be an Artificial
  Horizon, the ILS (Instrument Landing System), or weather-detecting Radar.

* Terrain-following Avionics
  These are automatic systems that allow the vehicle to fly at insane
  speeds very close to the ground, without manging to actually _hit_
  the ground or other terrain features.  They would use the Flight
  Avionics to sense things that need to be avoided, and then fly the
  vehicle (or at least, help the pilot fly the vehicle) around them.
  Good current-day examples of Terrain-following Avionics would be
  the terrain-following autopilots of the F-111 or the Tornado.

* Navigational Aids
  These are instruments that tell you where you are in the world, but not
  necessarily which direction you are pointed in, or how fast you\'re going.
  In many cases, what is extrodinary accuracy (for navigational purposes) is
  nearly useless for practical flying.  Knowing where you are to within 500m
  is great if you\'re lost, but won\'t help you set down on a 100m-wide
  runway if (due to weather conditions, for example) you can\'t see out.
  Good current-day examples of Navigational Aids would be a GPS system.

While in the Real World there is considerable overlap between Flight
Avionics and Navigational Aids (knowing that you\'re 15 miles from a certain
VOR beacon, on radial 240 is almost as good as a GPS fix), for game
purposes I think it\'s fair to assume that there\'s no overlap.  In other
words, if your craft has Flight Avionics but not Navigational Aids, then
there are no instruments to tell the pliot where she is.  If for some reason
the vehicle became lost, the pilot\'s Navigation skill could be used to
figure it out, though.

> 2. Why are the descriptions (slightly) different?

See above.  That\'s why.  They\'re similar sets of instruments designed for
different purposes.  In some cases, an instrument (like a sextant or a
HSI, for example) will be included in one, but not the other.

> 3. The following stats are different in the two tables:

I\'d assume that it is deliberate.  Given the descriptions, I\'d also say that
the differences in cost are from the different purpose (or additional
instrumentation) required for the navigation function.  The other stats are
probably not different simply because size differences in the liter and
kilogram range are too small to accurately track in FF&S.

Again, I\'d assume these are systems with different purposes that use the
same level of technology (and in some cases, the same sort of technology)
for purposes of either flying the vehicle (Flight Avionics) or figuring
out where you are (Navigational Aids).

> 4. Is "Integrates IGS positioning" (nav aid table) meant to read simply

Offhand, I\'d assume it\'s a typo for "Integrated IGS Positioning".

I was getting that feeling, but why is the lab ship open frame?  Or why is
the Valor a cylinder, and not close?  Or for that matter the Zho strike cruiser
strikes me as close structure, but it\'s listed as wedge for some reason.  MT
had little desriptions of the hull forms, and HG didn\'t say anything----too bad
close structue was dropped from MT :)

So the discovery from 2001 is close.  The Leonov would seem to be close, but the
only traveller analog is open (lab ship), or maybe box (?).

A star destroyer is wedge (one that works!).

The Millenium Falcon would be dome/disk.

All in all, I think the lengths for different hull forms should be taken as 
guidelines, and not forced.  It seems gdw took existing designs and since they
knew the length, they picked the hull form based on that, regardless of what it
looked like (my guess).

Near the Regency\'s extreme spinward tip lies Jewell, capital of the Jewell
subsector and for centuries the first line of defense against incursions by
the Zhodani Consulate.  While relations with the Zhodani have improved
greatly in recent decades, Jewell still resembles nothing so much as a
massive military encampment.  Almost six centuries of living on the \'front
lines\' has given the inhabitants of Jewell a unique, if somewhat grim
outlook.

Jewell was settled in the early 200\'s by colonists fleeing the chaos and
violence of the Julian Wars.  The colonists, of mixed Solomani-Vilani
heritage, initially settled on Palique (0609 / Mora), before religious
tensions forced them to more on to Jewell.  The original colony grew slowly,
hampered largely by respiratory problems caused by volcanic outgassing.  The
discovery of unusually rich lanthanum deposits on the planet\'s eastern
hemisphere sparked a huge influx of immigrants and business investment.
Jewell also became the jumping-off point for further settlement in the
Chronor subsector, and beyond the Spinward Marches in the Foreven Sector.

With increasing industrialisation, and a growing realisation of the
potential Zhodani threat to spinward saw the Imperial government begin to
take an interest in Jewell.  A naval presence was established in the system,
followed by the establishment of a Navy and Scout base from 480-485.  A
century later, ships from the Jewell Squadron were the backbone of Imperial
forces that jockeyed for position with the Zhodani in the Chronor and
Massina (subsec D/Foreven) subsectors.  This jockeying soon erupted into
open warfare as the First Frontier War exploded through the Marches.

Jewell was captured by Zhodani forces in 592, and occupied until Olav
hault-Plankwell retook the system amid fierce fighting in 603.  The end of
the war saw the Zhodani in possession of former Imperial worlds in the
Foreven Sector, and Jewell became a major factor in the Imperium\'s plans to
defend the Spinward Marches from further attack.  Predictably enough, Jewell
was attacked heavily during the Second Frontier War (615-620), and was under
seige for almost eight months before Admiral Arbellatra Akhalikhoi relieved
the world in 617.  After the war, with most of the Chronor Subsector in
Zhodani hands, Jewell became even more important to the Imperial Navy.
Facilities were expanded, and the naval presence in the system scaled up.

Industrialisation of Jewell continued, at a predictable cost to the
planetary biosphere. Jewell\'s population mushroomed, due to the arrival of
refugees from former imperial worlds, and fortune-seekers looking for
employment.  Jewell was attacked heavily in each of the subsequent Frontier
Wars, and suffered grievously, although it remained in Imperial hands.  By
the assassination of Emperor Strephon in 1116, Jewell was one of the most
heavily defended systems in the Marches, as well as being a heavily
industrialised world and home to 6 billion souls.

On entering the Jewell system, be prepared to be immediately challenged by
Regency Navy or Regency Quarantine Service ships.  Incoming starships will
be directed to the RQS Station on Opal (Jewell\'s outermost satellite,
F10026B-C), where the ship and it\'s occupants will undergo exhaustive
examination.  Ships that do not pass inspection will be impounded
immediately, and it\'s owners/operators can look forward to a lengthy sojourn
at the Regency Prison on Jenghe/Regina.  Whatever the result, expect to be
held on Opal for at least three days.

Following quarantine procedures, permission will be granted to transfer to
one of Jewell\'s three commercial starports:  Jewell Highport, Jewell
Downport or Magdala Commercial Starport (a privately owned facility).  All
other starport facilities in the system are operated by the Regency Navy
and/or Quarantine Service, and are strictly off limits to unauthorised
personnel.  Still, one can\'t help but notice the presence of warships -
Jewell is swarming with activity, from 10-ton boats shuttling to and fro to
the BatRon of Plankwell Class Battleships home-ported at the Arbellatra
Akhalikhoi Naval Base.

Descending to the surface, one of the more noticable sights are the banks of
dirty brown clouds covering a rocky gray surface.  Sprawling cities and
industrial complexes mark much of the planet\'s surface, and a large fraction
of it\'s land area.  Jewell, despite it\'s name, is a dirty and grimy world.
The atmosphere is fouled by a host of pollutants, chiefly sulphur dioxide,
hydrogen sulphide and nitrogen compounds.  Breathing the atmosphere without
a filter mask is not advisable - a few hours exposure is generally
acceptable, but further exposure inevitably results in respiratory disorders
and cancers.  Filter masks are provided free of charge by the government,
and are dispensed at all public places.  On arrival at the planet\'s surface,
visitors will be issued with a temporary permit for a nominal fee.

Jewell\'s cities tend to look alike - dirty and drab are the words most used
by offworlders to describe them.  Little attention is paid to building
exteriors, beyond that necessary to keep the atmospheric taints outside.
Combine this with the gray coveralls that seem to be a regulation item of
clothing amongst the locals, and the filter masks that cover the face and
eyes, and a visitor could well be tempted to make a hasty departure for more
inviting locations.  Perserverance is advised however, for like most surface
appearances, those on Jewell are deceiving.

Jewell\'s natives are friendly and accomadating towards off-worlders, with
the notable exception of Zhodani and Vargr (both races are the target of
centuries old fear and loathing).  Once indoors, with coveralls and
facemasks off, Jewellers are an expansive and demonstrative lot and are
famous drinkers, brawlers and poets.  Building interiors are generally
low-ceilinged, and richly decorated, designed to promote a sense of comfort
and well being.  Jewell also has one of the highest number of bars per
capita of any world in the Regency.

Jewell\'s government is a fairly unremarkable impersonal beauracracy, local
Administrative Councils report to successively higher authorities, up to the
Planetary Administrative Authority.  The beauracracy recruits from all
levels of society, and if promotion is not entirely merit based, it is not
so corrupt as to invite popular revolt. Law levels are high, banning
personal weapons outside of the home, and the local law enforcement
authorities are backed by a large and complex legal apparatus.  Trade
regulations are not as harsh, their primary focus being to serve the
requirements of the Regency Quarantine Service.  Jewell\'s government
maintains low tarrifs on most imported goods.

The most important non-governmental body on Jewell is the \'Aran Kalje\', a
fiercely atheistic organisation that promotes the virtues of physical and
mental discipline.  The Aran maintains camps, or \'laager\' where adherents
live for up to twenty months at a time under military-type conditions.  Not
surprisingly, a large number of Aran members end up in Jewell\'s armed
forces.  The laager are organised and run at a local level, as is the rest
of the organisation.

Jewell\'s close relationship with the Imperial/Regency military is also worth
noting.  Large tracts of the planet are used by the Army, Navy and
Quarantine Service, and are off limits to civillians.  The planetary
governer is also commander of the planetary armed forces, as well as the
Jewell Subsector navy (the governor is also Duke of the Jewell Subsector).
Traditionally, the planetary governor has been an Imperial or Regency Navy
Admiral, one of the rare instances when domestic matters are overridden by
Imperial or Regency authorities.

Jewell is a major producer of lanthanum and other rare earth elements
(notably niobium and yttrium ores), as well as fissionable ores.  Not
surprisingly, the planet is also a substantial weapons producer,
particularly small arms and armoured vehicles in the TL 11-12 range.
Perhaps the most famous product of Jewell is whisky, which is famed
throughout the Regency for it\'s quality.  There are no less than 37 major
distilling houses on Jewell, serving a large domestic and off-world market.
Of these, the most well known is Amrihkur-Cameron, which has held Imperial
patents for it\'s products since 405.  A bottle of Amrikhur-Cameron malt
whiskey bottled in 1107 recently sold for Cr44,000 on Regina.

Really Big Lasers  & Focal Arrays

	I\'ve been playing around with the design sequence for building
lasers, after having read some of the designs posted here, and have
noticed something about the focal arrays length: it\'s not normally
calculated. However it can be calculated from

					focal array volume
	Focal array length   =  ________________________________
					focal array cross sectional area

or more simply from

	Laser discharge energy * focal array volume modifier
(See page 126 FF&S)

Hence a 1,000,000 Mj  TL 15 laser  with a damage value of 2500  and a
penetration rating of about  1/800  has a 1000m long focal array. 
Overpowering this laser to -5 diff would increase the length to 8000m.
The smallest ship which could mount this would have a needle
configuration hull  in excess of 710,000,000 DTonnes. 
	On the other hand a PAW with a damage value of 2500 has a
constant minimum length of 500m, fitting on a ship of just less than
200,000 DTonnes, and incidentally an 8000m long paw has a damage value
of 40,000.
	PAW and laser performances would cross over at a damage value of
1000 250m in length (fitting on a needle just a shade over 20,000
DTonnes) over powered to -2 diff but for the fact that the laser,  and
its power plant;  power plant fuel;  the accommodation and workstations
for the lasers and power  plants engineers, maintenance crew, command
crew, gunner,  medical staff, stewards etc come to well over 18,500
DTonnes in volume (that was a very rough calculation and I may well have
made big mistakes)
	I would be interested to know how long people think a focal
array would have to be before it could no longer be thought of as
trainable for the purposes of space combat ie at what point will it
bend, osculate and wobble too much to be able to have any reasonable
chance of tracking an object at more  than 0.1 of a light second.

Addenda
	There has been talk of a maximum discharge energy of TL*50 Mj so
I have included a short table showing the relationship between tech
level, suggested maximum discharge energy, overpowering and length.

	TL	DE (Mj)	Length 	 
				no overpowering	overpowered to -5 diff
	7	350		350m			2800m
	8	400		400m			3200m
	9	450		45m			360m
	10	500		5m			40m
	11	550		5.5m			44m
	12	600		0.6m			4.8m
	13	650		0.65m			5.2m
	14	700		0.7m			5.6m
	15	750		0.75m			6m

The feeling I got was the participants in that discussion only looked at the 
MG as a beam weapon. The only thing that the MG has in common with a laser 
is that it is projected as a beam, but the damage is a sphere centered on 
the point of explosion.

The main difference is that a laser which got high enough damage just 
punches through the craft only doing damage to 2 sections of a craft. What 
energy that are left from this is vented out into space and lost.

What we do not have in the rules is the danger space (DS) for a MG. If the 
dangerspace is large enough it can actually slag one or more sections of a 
craft. Maybe even envelope it totally, which would mean that the craft would 
be blown to pieces, or at least all crew being killed, and all systems being 
destroyed. In this way a MG will do more damage to a craft than a laser with 
the same effect value. 

As the damage roll on BL for MG\'s are done with straight d20, you may hit 
anywhere on the craft. From the damage rating of the MG there should be 
possible to calculate DS, which will be neccessary if the MG are going to be 
used as an artillery piece in the field. By deffinition all hits in a 
section of a craft is made ai its centre. What we need to know is the lenght 
of the section. This will vary with hull form and where on the craft the 
section is. If the diameter on the DS is larger than the section length, 
everything here will be destroyed (weapon mounts, electronics, crew etc). If 
there are hits to hold treat them as laser hits for resolution for how much 
damage received. If only parts of a section is hit, or only parts of a 
system is in the section as quarters, engineering, hold and such do also 
treat them as ordinary hits. If a section is effectively "killed" by being 
"swallowed" by the DS neighbouring sections will take damage as usual.

What I\'ll leave to the numbercrunchers of this list are to find out 
dangerspace and length of section formulas for this kind of damage system 
for BL.

Kind of.  Closer to a cylinder, though, since the decays happen along the 
path of the beam.

I posted a question some time ago along the same lines.  I think that this 
might be the easier way to go (if you\'re trying to come up with a reason for
MGs without the TL*50 limit).  What if a weapon can over penetrate?  A laser
or PAW whose beam dwells in one place too long punches through the other side
of the target, and the rest of the beam is wasted... use the excess damage
table, but if you get a result that requires the beam to stay in the same hull
area, take that damage, then up to another 5major hits, then exit via the 
opposite area (shots down the length of a target might be tricky, though).

It would give the MG an advantage since all the damage the weapon does would
actually hit the target.

I was wondering how this would change KE weapons, as well.

     Notes
     The Chimaeroc, a variant of the Jayhawk-class far trader, equipped 
     with beefed-up armor and laser barbette, was built on 
     Mertactor/Plankwell (B262732-B) for trader operation in the central 
     Spinward Marches.
     
     The design variations were installed with the diversity of the region 
     in mind.  The enterprising free trader might well find himself 
     crossing borders into any number of regions including the Sword 
     Worlds, the Federation of Arden, the Darrian Confederation, the 
     Zhodani Consulate and Aslan ihatei-settled space.  Often, the eager 
     trader is misunderstood and needs to pack a little extra punch for 
     defense or a quick getaway in these regions.
     Crossing borders often transmutes the legality of one\'s cargo as well. 
      For this purpose, a 142 m3 concealed cargo section with its own small 
     cargo hatch is included.
     
     Fuel purification machinery included (1.61 MW), requiring 24 hours to 
     refine 920 m3.  Fuel Scoops installed.

Nope.  It was settled sometime between 300 and 400, along with most of the
rest of the subsector.  The Jewell Cluster worlds of Jewell, Ruby, and
Emerald were members of the Imperium by 400, forming a small Imperial pocket
in the settled region.  The only other world in Jewell subsector that was
an Imperial member in 400 was Louzy, which was part of the Regina pocket.
In 300, Louzy was already in the Imperium but no settled regions existed 
beyond except five worlds down the Spinward Main in the Arden region.
(Sources: _Spinward Marches Campaign_, p. 18; _Traveller Adventure_, p. 15.)

You don\'t mention first survey, but traders contacted the Zhodani by 50, and
the IISS can\'t have been far behind.  The Darrians may have reached Jewell
shortly before the Maghiz; _Alien Realms_ has a small ruined Darrian facility

as close by as Emerald.  They didn\'t leave much of a mark if they did visit.

>Jewell Subsector navy (the governor is also Duke of the Jewell Subsector).

  "The Jewell subsector is fragmented into three distinct areas:  the
   Jewells, an Imperial region answering to the Duke of Regina...."

                                    -- _Spinward Marches Campaign_, p. 18.

I\'m not sure Jewell has a duke of it\'s own, as odd as that seems, especially
considering that it\'s designated as subsector capital.  However, there\'s
only another 12 million people on the other five Jewells (Ruby, Emerald,
Mongo, Nakege, and Lysen), so a powerful count might make sense, looking
to Norris.  It would still be considered a subsector capital because of the
massive coordinating facilities there to support the frontier watch.  The
other worlds reporting to Jewell first would be the Imperial (er, Regency)
government on Esalin/Jewell and lonely, libertarian Quar/Chronor.  Louzy 
could look either way; Jewell is jump-5 and Regina jump-7, but Louzy\'s 
historical ties are with Regina and mighty Efate is just next door.  Grant 
is under the Interdict.

There\'s a precedent for having a subsector capital with no duke in the 
Marches from _Traveller Adventure_.  Aramis only has a Tukera marquis, who
looks to the Count of Celepina, who looks to the Duke of Rhylanor.  The
Marches seem to be shorter than usual on high nobility....

Another thing: radio communicators consume huge amounts of energy in

Bart, barbettes are simply large turrets in FFS designs.  I\'m honestly at a loss
this morning for any background on the use of the word, if I remember later I\'ll
drop you a line.

A Master Fire Director (MFD) is used to control the firing of a battery of
weapons (_directing_ their fire at a target).  In addition, an MFD contains more
sophisticated fire control equipment than a turret or barbette has, and so it
improves the quality of the aiming task.

    'body' => 'Howdy,

Donald Munro\'s post, along with Brendan O\'Donovan\'s jump fighter got me 
thinking about lasers again (I like the non-grav-focused laser idea :)

He is right in pointing out the need for a size limit on trainable weapons.
One interesting idea I had makes the old hardpoint limits make sense (so the
limits on the TNE ships converted from CT/MT will still make sense. Basically
the idea comes out of having a large object rotating on a ship.  When the turret
in question is turned the ship "wants" to turn the other way, right?  This works
because the ship is so much more massive than the turret that while there is a 
force on the ship, it has enough inertia to make the counter-rotation small (and
therefore easy to correct for with thrusters, etc).

What if with hull volume converted to mass (same rules as used for Mdrive vs.
ship mass) a ship can only have 1 turret per 100 dtons...  The fact that the
lasers are now grav focused makes this make even more sense since the FA creates
a gravity source (read: mass) in/near the turret.  You could have more turrets,
but maybe you pay a maneuver penalty when you train the extra turrets.

Of couse this is all standardized on a 3dton turret (well, 3-6 dtons).  We\'d
need to come up with guidelines on turrets per dton based on the turret volume
(really mass, but abstracted as volume to be consistant).

Turret Size		Turrets/dton
(dtons)
----		----
0-2.99			2/100dtons
3-6.99			1/100
7-29.99			0.5/100
30-49.99		.25/100
50-99.99		.1/100
100-whatever		0.075/100

All fractional allowed turrets would be rounder *up*.  Any FA that can fit 
within a given turret is trainable, it\'s just that you need bigger and bigger
turrets to do so.  Non-trainable weapons wouldn\'t be restricted.

Bay weapons might be defined with limited arcs of fire, and the Bay Weapons per
dton table could be adjusted to allow a few more to be used.
 
I\'d still like to see the volume required for the steering mount, so that it
would take up volume in the turret (to limit numbers of super-lasers).  Maybe
the same 15*hull rate rule for Mdrives could be used as well.  If the turret
mass is more than 15*turret size (dtons) (calculated using the *maximum* size
on the chart (3-6.99, 7-29.99, etc)) then it jumps to the next allowed rate on
the chart.

ie: A massive 6dton barbette has a mass of 125 tonnes.  That means the number
of allowed turrets goes from 1 per 100dtons of ship to .5 per 100 dtons.

Ideas on the volume of the steering stuff would be great.

Yup, that would be useful :)

Barbette is from 19th century Terran history.

The word is probably from barbican (sp?) which is a (French?) term for a 
defensive wall. It may also be related to barricade etc.
The first turreted warships (circa 1870-90, such as the Monitor) had a 
turret that contained the guns, ammo, and sometimes traverse machinery.
In this form the turret was very heavy as all the armour had to be traversed 
as well as the guns.
The French used a different system where the side armour of the turret was 
fixed and the guns poked over the top in an open mount.
This fixed armour is referred to as a barbette.
This was lighter than an actual turret and meant that the guns could be 
mounted higher up and therefore fought in rougher weather.
As the barbette was vulnerable to plunging fire and fragments it was fitted 
with a hood of lighter armour which traversed with the guns.
These "Hooded Barbettes" came to be called turrets as the original type of 
turrets disappeared from service. This is the type of turret used for the 
main armament of the Iowa class battleships for instance.

Notes:
1. I think that the MT "Needle" is actually taken to read "Needle/Wedge", when 
   you look at the ships that are included as "Needle".  Maybe this is why FF&S 
   split up the Needle/Wedge config?
2. The HG Fiery Config is derived from a sentence in Supp 7 which says that the
   ship is similar to the Scout/Courier.
3. Not even the self-titled adventure has HG stats for the "Safari Ship"!
4. The "Gionetti" looks like an Imperial Star Destroyer, only smaller. The 
   Kokirrak looks the same, but has two "wings" (with boxes on their ends).
----

It appears that "config" is whatever you want, that seems reasonable at the 
time, and that suits your particular streamlining need.

(The classic) P. F. Sloan-class Fleet Escort was detailed in _JTAS #25_. and 
perhaps some insight can be gained from reading the designer\'s notes - by none 
other than Marc Miller himself.

"Producing deck plans from a set of HG statistics can be an intimidating
experience..." (p 20) - no kidding!

"The primary reference for the Sloan class Fleet Escort is a Paul Jaquays 
illustration in _Traveller Supplement 9: Fighting Ships_. Accompanying the 
picture is a detailed HG description, including USP and some background 
details." (p 20)

Marc then ran through how he broke down the picture into components, gave them
approximate ratios, and computed the tonnage of each component. Here\'s another 
pearl of wisdom for would-be designers:

"I treat required tonnages as requirements for TOTAL ship tonnage. Within the
ship, I did not feel compelled to make each stateroom four tons, nor the bridge
precisely 100 tons; instead, the sum of the tonnage is distributed around the
ship as support facilities or corridors". (p 20)

Some examples of support facilities are: armoury, vehicle deck, mess deck 
(including mess hall and galley), ship\'s locker, troop assembly areas, captain\'s 
office, recreation areas, etc.

Finally, _Book 2: Starships_ states that deck plans are acceptable if they are
within 10% to 20% of the actual stats.

"WET" SHIPS (SURFACE NAVY)

Joni Virolainen asked if there were any official design sequencs for surface 
ships. The only ones I know of are for MT and were:

1. _Challenge_ #53, 54, "Wet Navy, Pts 1 & 2", Terrance R. McInnes, GDW, USA,
   1991.
2. _Challenge_ #61, "Equalizer Project", Terrance R. McInnes, GDW, USA, 1992.
   - includes complete details for 9 Large Watercraft, incl. a carrier, 
   battlecruiser, sub, etc.
3. _Challenge_ #61, "Wood and Wind, Steel and Steam", Charles E. Gannon, GDW,
   USA, 1992.

Perhaps these could be converted using "standard" MT-to-TNE conversion
routines?

this subject!

EMERGENCY LOW BERTHS

The original rules are as follows:
"Emergency low berths weigh 1 ton and cost Cr 100,000; each contains four
persons, all of whom share the survival roll. Emergency low berths cannot hold
the frozen watch. An emergency low berth can hold one concious person
(functioning as the equivalent of a couch) for several hours at a time."
(_Book 5: High Guard_, Marc Miller, GDW, 1980, USA, p 34)

The same rule can be found in _Book 2: Starships_, GDW, 1977, 1981, USA, p 14.

The original survival roll was 5+ on 2D6 - a 4 in 12 (33%) chance of death! Even
a medic could only reduce this to 3 in 12 (25%)!

_High Guard_ did not change this ruling, so the frozen watch was in a bad way.

MT modified it to increase survival, since many people had pointed out that the
high chance of death would cripple the concept of the frozen watch; one, no-one
would volunteer; two, you could only get so many of your personnel back!

The MT rules are:
"To survive a low passage voyage: Routine, Medical, Edu, 1 min. (Fateful)
Referee: the Medical and Edu are those of the attending physician at the time of
deberthing, not those of the character at risk.
Various effects occur for any mishap (roll 2D):
Superficial Mishap: the subject temporarily suffers 1D wounds for 1-6 days,
after which healing is automatic; skin loses some of its tone and colour for 1-6
weeks, having a gray, wrinkled appearance.
Minor Mishap: the subject temporarily suffers 2D wounds for 1-6 days, after
which healing is automatic; subject experiences motor function problems for 1-6
weeks with corresponding loss of 2 points of Dex during that time.
Major Mishap: the subject suffers 3D permanent wounds; the subject\'s internal
organs are damaged; and the subject must undergo medical diagnosis and treatment
to restore full health.
Destroyed: not possible on a 2D mishap."
(_Imperial Encyclopedia_, Marc W. Miller, GDW, 1987, USA, p 87)

An entire article is devoted to the subject in_The Traveller\'s Digest_ #21. The
article covers:
- active hibernation (via chill berth);
- passive hibernation (via fast drug);
- freezing (cold berth)
- use of low berths (including the low lottery, emergency low berths, the frozen
  watch, medical cold berths, and livestock cold berths);
- low berths and space transportation;
- suspended animation and society (including "Timer Clubs").

The salient points covering cold berths are:
- normal low berths freeze at a moderate rate, including scanning and mapping
the body, cooling sections and then quick-freezing the body;
- normal low berths thaw at a moderate rate, using the data gathered when
freezing the body to unfreeze it in a "precisely controlled pattern" (p 41);
- an emergency cold berth freezes very quickly and thaws very slowly. At TL 15,
one berth can freeze 4 adult humans "- fully-clothed and unprepared - within 60
seconds. To do this, it foregoes all preliminary steps, trading ease of entry
for a lengthy and difficult revival process" (p 41);
- the frozen watch is frozen very slowly and thawed very quickly. They are
frozen over a 3 hour period (at TL 15), identifying and fixing all potential
thawing problems in advance. They are unfrozen rapidly "without the careful
monitoring and adjusting" (p 41) of normal low berths, and are capable of action
in 5 minutes.

The mention of "Timer Clubs" (where people would be revived every 10, 25, or 50
years) paved the way for GDW to allow "remnants" into the TNE universe.

Finally, the chance of a survival mishap was increased:
"To revive a low berth passenger without incident: Difficult, Medical, Edu,
[time varies], (unskilled OK, fateful)
Referee: the Medical and Edu are those of the medic attending at the time of revival."
Time increments are given in a table, and an expanded list of mishap results is
included.

A barbette is essentially a larger turret capable of holding more or larger
weapons. Historically, i can only think of the Barbette occuring in aircraft.
Many WWII aircraft mounted single/double machine gun turrets. The Northrop
Black Widow had a remotely controlled barbette mounting four weapons. I can\'t
remember if the weapons were standard machine guns, .50cal Brownings, 20mm 
cannon etc.

I\'m not sure but i think barbettes also appeared on the bombers of Strategic
Air Command in the post-WWII/Cold War era.

Near the Regency\'s extreme spinward tip lies Jewell, capital of the Jewell
subsector and for centuries the first line of defense against incursions by
the Zhodani Consulate.  While relations with the Zhodani have improved
greatly in recent decades, Jewell still resembles nothing so much as a
massive military encampment.  Almost six centuries of living on the \'front
lines\' has given the inhabitants of Jewell a unique, if somewhat grim
outlook.

Jewell was settled in the early 300\'s by colonists fleeing from the Lishun
and Vland Sectors.  The colonists, of mixed Solomani-Vilani heritage,
initially settled on Palique (0609 / Mora), before religious tensions forced
them to more on to Jewell.  The original colony grew slowly, hampered
largely by respiratory problems caused by volcanic outgassing.  The
discovery of unusually rich lanthanum deposits on the planet\'s eastern
hemisphere sparked a huge influx of immigrants and business investment.
Jewell also became the jumping-off point for further settlement in the
Chronor subsector, and beyond the Spinward Marches in the Foreven Sector.

With increasing industrialisation, and a growing realisation of the
potential Zhodani threat to spinward saw the Imperial government begin to
take an interest in Jewell.  A naval presence was established in the system,
followed by the establishment of a Navy and Scout base from 480-485.  A
century later, ships from the Jewell Squadron were the backbone of Imperial
forces that jockeyed for position with the Zhodani in the Chronor and
Massina (subsec D/Foreven) subsectors.  This jockeying soon erupted into
open warfare as the First Frontier War exploded through the Marches.

Jewell was captured by Zhodani forces in 592, and occupied until Olav
hault-Plankwell retook the system amid fierce fighting in 603.  The end of
the war saw the Zhodani in possession of former Imperial worlds in the
Foreven Sector, and Jewell became a major factor in the Imperium\'s plans to
defend the Spinward Marches from further attack.  Predictably enough, Jewell
was attacked heavily during the Second Frontier War (615-620), and was under
seige for almost eight months before Admiral Arbellatra Akhalikhoi relieved
the world in 617.  After the war, with most of the Chronor Subsector in
Zhodani hands, Jewell became even more important to the Imperial Navy.
Facilities were expanded, and the naval presence in the system scaled up.

Industrialisation of Jewell continued, at a predictable cost to the
planetary biosphere. Jewell\'s population mushroomed, due to the arrival of
refugees from former imperial worlds, and fortune-seekers looking for
employment.  Jewell was attacked heavily in each of the subsequent Frontier
Wars, and suffered grievously, although it remained in Imperial hands.  By
the assassination of Emperor Strephon in 1116, Jewell was one of the most
heavily defended systems in the Marches, as well as being a heavily
industrialised world and home to 6 billion souls.

On entering the Jewell system, be prepared to be immediately challenged by
Regency Navy or Regency Quarantine Service ships.  Incoming starships will
be directed to the RQS Station on Opal (Jewell\'s outermost satellite,
F10026B-C), where the ship and it\'s occupants will undergo exhaustive
examination.  Ships that do not pass inspection will be impounded
immediately, and it\'s owners/operators can look forward to a lengthy sojourn
at the Regency Prison on Jenghe/Regina.  Whatever the result, expect to be
held on Opal for at least three days.

Following quarantine procedures, permission will be granted to transfer to
one of Jewell\'s three commercial starports:  Jewell Highport, Jewell
Downport or Magdala Commercial Starport (a privately owned facility).  All
other starport facilities in the system are operated by the Regency Navy
and/or Quarantine Service, and are strictly off limits to unauthorised
personnel.  Still, one can\'t help but notice the presence of warships -
Jewell is swarming with activity, from 10-ton boats shuttling to and fro to
the BatRon of Plankwell Class Battleships home-ported at the Arbellatra
Akhalikhoi Naval Base.

Descending to the surface, one of the more noticable sights are the banks of
dirty brown clouds covering a rocky gray surface.  Sprawling cities and
industrial complexes mark much of the planet\'s surface, and a large fraction
of it\'s land area.  Jewell, despite it\'s name, is a dirty and grimy world.
The atmosphere is fouled by a host of pollutants, chiefly sulphur dioxide,
hydrogen sulphide and nitrogen compounds.  Breathing the atmosphere without
a filter mask is not advisable - a few hours exposure is generally
acceptable, but further exposure inevitably results in respiratory disorders
and cancers.  Filter masks are provided free of charge by the government,
and are dispensed at all public places.  On arrival at the planet\'s surface,
visitors will be issued with a temporary permit for a nominal fee.

Jewell\'s cities tend to look alike - dirty and drab are the words most used
by offworlders to describe them.  Little attention is paid to building
exteriors, beyond that necessary to keep the atmospheric taints outside.
Combine this with the gray coveralls that seem to be a regulation item of
clothing amongst the locals, and the filter masks that cover the face and
eyes, and a visitor could well be tempted to make a hasty departure for more
inviting locations.  Perserverance is advised however, for like most surface
appearances, those on Jewell are deceiving.

Jewell\'s natives are friendly and accomadating towards off-worlders, with
the notable exception of Zhodani and Vargr (both races are the target of
centuries old fear and loathing).  Once indoors, with coveralls and
facemasks off, Jewellers are an expansive and demonstrative lot and are
famous drinkers, brawlers and poets.  Building interiors are generally
low-ceilinged, and richly decorated, designed to promote a sense of comfort
and well being.  Jewell also has one of the highest number of bars per
capita of any world in the Regency.

Jewell\'s government is a fairly unremarkable impersonal beauracracy, local
Administrative Councils report to successively higher authorities, up to the
Planetary Administrative Authority.  The beauracracy recruits from all
levels of society, and if promotion is not entirely merit based, it is not
so corrupt as to invite popular revolt. Law levels are high, banning
personal weapons outside of the home, and the local law enforcement
authorities are backed by a large and complex legal apparatus.  Trade
regulations are not as harsh, their primary focus being to serve the
requirements of the Regency Quarantine Service.  Jewell\'s government
maintains low tarrifs on most imported goods.

The most important non-governmental body on Jewell is the \'Aran Kalje\', a
fiercely atheistic organisation that promotes the virtues of physical and
mental discipline.  The Aran maintains camps, or \'laager\' where adherents
live for up to twenty months at a time under military-type conditions.  Not
surprisingly, a large number of Aran members end up in Jewell\'s armed
forces.  The laager are organised and run at a local level, as is the rest
of the organisation.

Jewell\'s close relationship with the Imperial/Regency military is also worth
noting.  Large tracts of the planet are used by the Army, Navy and
Quarantine Service, and are off limits to civillians.  The planetary
governor is also commander of the planetary armed forces, as well as the
Jewell Colonial Squadron.  The governor carries the title of Count Jewell,
and reports to the Duke of Regina.  Traditionally, the planetary governor
has been an Imperial or Regency Navy Admiral, one of the rare instances when
domestic matters are overridden by Imperial or Regency authorities.

Jewell is a major producer of lanthanum and other rare earth elements
(notably niobium and yttrium ores), as well as fissionable ores.  Not
surprisingly, the planet is also a substantial weapons producer,
particularly small arms and armoured vehicles in the TL 11-12 range.
Perhaps the most famous product of Jewell is whisky, which is famed
throughout the Regency for it\'s quality.  There are no less than 37 major
distilling houses on Jewell, serving a large domestic and off-world market.
Of these, the most well known is Amrihkur-Cameron, which has held Imperial
patents for it\'s products since 405.  A bottle of Amrikhur-Cameron malt
whiskey bottled in 1107 recently sold for Cr44,000 on Regina.

I agree with you, most designs we will see of lasers and crafts using them, 
I expect, will not addere to the TL*50 limit anyway. And there is no way we 
can enforce that without GDW making it official.  Besides I find the MG 
damage sphere more realistic as MG\'s destroy anything within their DS. And a 
hull section may have more than 5H in its self. Think of a hit in the 
section holding the electronics. There went the bridge and bridge crew. Who 
need critical hit tables when you got a MG?

It would be fun if there was possible to get a result of hitting a needle 
craft in the front and letting the beam go down the length of the ship :)

Not only that, but if the DS is large enough the craft may be killed by a 
single shot.

Umm...  Missed it by THAT much!

There are 36 possible results in a 2d6 roll.  There are 6 and only
6 ways to roll a 4 or less.  So the chance of getting 4- on the roll
is 16.667%.

There are 3 and only 3 ways to roll a 3 or less, so the chance for that
is 8.333%.

Remember, rolling multiple dice produces a nonlinear probability curve
for results.

(Still, I don\'t like *those* odds, either)

Well, if you can stand it:

1)  Determine the displacement tonnage of the Armor on the High
Guard ship.

2)  Apply that same displacement tonnage to the T:NE ship, using
the material appropriate for the tech level, and see what AV this
gives you.  (Some weird number, no doubt).

Also note that there will be anomalies.  If I remember correctly,
Dispersed structure hulls could have no armor.  And there were 
other ships which were armored as well...  These would just get
the minimum required for their G-rating.

 For what it\'s worth...

 In New York City, we have two kinds of \'standard blocks\'.  The
 _short_block_, from one numbered street to the next, along an
 avenue, is 0.05 miles (80.45m).  A _long_block_, from one numbered
 avenue to the next, along a street, is about 0.2 to 0.25 miles
 (321.8 to 402.25m).

 Let\'s assume short blocks.  Your 280m craft is about 3.5 blocks
 long.  Now, we\'re missing two very important dimensions - how
 _wide_ is that sucker, and how many decks (3m per deck) _high_ is
 it?  Consider One and Two World Trade Center, here in New York.
 It\'s about one square short block, by more than 110 decks high.
 I\'m fairly confident that it could easily support a sizeable crew,
 without changing the exterior dimensions.

 Better still - let\'s look at displacements - what\'s the
 displacement of your armored cruiser, and what\'s the displacement
 of the total "living space" that needs to be allocated for your
 crew?  FWIW, the "Patrol Cruiser" in T:TNE (basic rules) is a
 5600m3 (400td) job, measuring 66m in length - less than a single
 block.  It takes a crew of 15.  If we just scale up this ship to
 accommodate 245 crew, we\'re looking at a monster of a ship -
 6500+td!

 Also, let me point out that living space on military craft is
 likely to be cramped - I went to visit the retired USN carrier
 _Intrepid_ on the West Side of Manhattan, and was surprised at how
 cramped everything was inside.  Downright claustrophobic, almost.
 They spend a lot more than a week at a time in those conditions...

Webster\'s defines a [naval] barbette as "the armored structure around a gun 
platform on a warship".  Historically barbettes were limited traverse weapon 
mounts located on the sides of ships.  The barbette itself does not move -- 
rather, it functioned as an armored blister for the weapon itself.  Pre-
dreadnought battleships often had barbettes on the sides of the ship in 
addition to turrets on top -- Dewey\'s flagship at the Battle of Manilla Bay 
(USS Olympia?) has this configuration.  

The remotely controlled weapons mount on the Black Widow was a *turret*, not
a 
barbette.

Hi,

When you think of them as *ships* they\'re not very big at all... players\'
sized ships (say under 1000 dtons) are all kinda airplane sized as I see \'em.


I\'ll dig up some figures and list dtons of aircraft (I\'ll assume simple
cylinders, and ignore the wings) that we\'ve all seen as soon as I can.  The
ref
of the game I\'m in (will he *ever* get back from Bosnia?) was on a Coast
Guard
cutter that had a crew of something like 56, and we guessed it to be about
700-
800 tons if I remember correctly. Of course it wasn\'t almost 60% fuel :)

Also, except arround the doors and service areas, a 747 has 10 seats
per row (3 on either side and 4 in the middle) and assuming the
spacing of the rows is 1m, that makes for slightly less than 700
passengers.  Going by memory (it\'s been 8 years since I last looked 
at a travel info sheet on a 747) that seems about right as there are 
about 30 seats on the upper deck.

I think the plane is about 12m in diameter and so this would make for
a total approx displacement of 7900m^3=564 dtons.

So, if a 564 ton airplane can sqeeze in 600-700 passengers, the crew, 
thier luggage, and the fuel, I imagine the Armoured Cruiser can 
manage 245 people (don\'t know its specs, but by Bri\'s assumption, 
it\'s 4 times as long as a 747 and thus >= 4 times the displacement).

One problem with this though, I thought a 747 was longer than 70m.

I choppped off the non-cylindrical bits :)  I was going for order of 
magnitude.

As for the actual volume, I got a similar number when I did it, the 2000 tons
was from FFS (they must use a bigger diameter).

Well your adverage USN conventional carrier runs about 300m
long with a full crew of around 6500 men
The Battleships run about the same length, but have crews in
the 1500 to 2500 range.
Where as you adverage supply ship is about 1/3 the length or
100m with crews running about 300, or with repair ships 600
but the length still is about 100m.
 
As for easy visualization I prefer the Buick scale: 1 Full
sized Buick wagon = 15ft, or approx. 5m. The easy way to
use this scale is to take your players out to some urban
resadentual street with plenty of parked buicks (or fords
or chevys, etc..) and have one lucky soul walk down the street
counting off buicks until he/she/it gets to the right length.
Then do this for the other diametions as well and you will start to see
how big these ships really are.
 
Or the last measure a Boeing 747 runs to about 400 tonnes
(Mr.Kundert may have to help me on that one)

be square root of DP divided on 2 dropping fractions.

Rather than finding the dimensionsof the section, compare the volume of the 
blast (BV) to the volume of the hull section. If the BV exeeds this 
everything and everyone in that section is dead/destroyed. Divide the 
restvolume from BV on all neighbouring sections including outside which will 
be its own section. Deal damage to these sections as normal, unless these 
too gets engulfed in the last.

Hits in area 1 or area 20 is the easiest to handle. If a blast in area one 
got a diameter equal to half the lenght of the ship, areas 1 through 9 (or 
12 through 20 if the hit is in the aft) gets slagged, while area 10 and 
eleven gets normal damage.

This is only a rough outline. I don\'t know if the DS figure is realistic for 
such a weapon, and would there be secondary and teriary zones to the blast? 
Then I primarily think of ground combat.

Comments are welcome.

In _Survival Margin_, covering the end of the Rebellion period, there
are a few entries covering Ine Givar activities on Rhylanor (a student
demonstration) and Regina (a bomb strike at a mall near where Norris
was supposed to visit). Their press releases always referred to
Archduke Norris as "Duke Norris" and were filled with phrases like
"the moment for democracy is now!". These incidents were followed by a
statement by Zhodani envoy Shtebifriashav who said that the Zhodani
had terminated all dealings with the Ine Givar after the Fifth
Frontier War.

Since GDW hasn\'t published any Regency-specific info for TNE, there\'s
no canonical info on the IG in the NE as far as I know.

 The Armored Cruiser(according to Fighting Ships. I\'ll post my T:NE 
conversion soon when I\'m done) is 50,000dtons. big.
 And, IMO, even a Scout/Courrier is pretty big for 3 people plus a few 
passangers to live on. Keep in mind, the point where I was visulizing it 
from was the \'keel\' of the ship. So I got a full view of the things size 
and just pictured it landing on top of me.
 The Armored Cruiser would be no strech for 240crew(if the number 
survives conversion, wich is in doubt). Seeing as how it is 280m and the 
Scout is 42m.
 From being on a 38ft sail boat -vs- (my Grandparents) new 42ft sail boat 
it\'s obvious to me what a diffrince a few m can make.

Webster\'s defines a [naval] barbette as "the armored structure around a gun
platform on a warship".

Yep, reader\'s of my previous post on this subject:

                            TRAVELLER Digest 368
  2) Re: Fire Fusion and Steel
        by "Upton, Django" <DUpton@vtrnntov.telecom.com.au>

will see that I agree with this definition.

 ----
Historically barbettes were limited traverse weapon
mounts located on the sides of ships.
 ----

I think you\'re getting confused with CASEMATE mounts.
Most barbette mounts are not limited in traverse except by the presence of 
the ships superstructure.

 ----
The barbette itself does not move --
rather, it functioned as an armored blister for the weapon itself.  Pre-
dreadnought battleships often had barbettes on the sides of the ship in
addition to turrets on top -- Dewey\'s flagship at the Battle of Manilla Bay
(USS Olympia?) has this configuration.
 ----

A typical Pre-dreadnought battle ship has 2 turrets (one fore and one aft ) 
each with 2 12 inch guns; a secondary armament of ~12 6 inch guns would be 
mounted in casemates along the sides of the ship. The ship would have no 
Barbette mounts at all!
I don\'t know about the particular ship you mention ( which may well have had 
barbettes for all I know... but I doubt it ) but barbettes were NOT common 
on Pre-dreadnought Battleships and Cruisers.

In the 20th century barbette mounts have mainly been used for AA guns,
examples being the single mount 5 inch guns on old battleships used in WWII 
and the quad 40mm mounts used extensively on many warship types in WWII.

The remotely controlled weapons mount on the Black Widow was a *turret*, not
a barbette.
 ----

The remote turret on the P61 may have been called a barbette because of its 
flat shape compared with the round turrets used on other aircraft at the 
time.

                             ABOUT CHVIEW

For as long our species has gazed into the night sky, we have been awed by
the vision of countless stars.  Having now deduced that stars are radiant
suns like our own, many cannot help but imagine what we might find if we
traveled to those faraway, unknown places.  With no means of interstellar
travel today, we can only dream that our descendants will.

[This Beta-test, WINDOWS-based version of] CHVIEW is intended as a three-
dimensional aid to:  viewing some of the nearer stars of our galaxy;
navigating the distances and gravity "gradients" between them;  accessing
basic information (and updating what we know); and, hopefully, having some
fun.  The current data file provides about 2,600 known stars within 100
light-years of Earth.  Future plans include modules for selecting a star
(or multiple star system) and, based on available data and known
astronomical relationships, for creating your own star system (of planets,
moons, asteroids, Kuiper belt, Oort cloud/cometary halo, and even human
colonies or space communities), for voyaging in faster-than-light (FTL)
"starships", and the like.

CHVIEW is brought to you by Jo Grant and Ben Lin with the assistance of
other subscribers of the CHERRYHLIST discussion group at
JAYMIN@MATHS.TCD.IE.  While some of us have been collecting star data for
years, all of us are fans of the Hugo-winning author, C.J. Cherryh, who has
developed an intriguing scenario for human colonization of our neighboring
stars.  As you may guessed, the name "CHVIEW" is a tribute to her.
Depending on where you obtained this copy of CHVIEW, in fact, some of the
"Place Names" assigned to selected stars may be the names of Cherryh\'s
fictional human colonies -- easily changed to suit your fancy.

(Just to play devil\'s advocate) I\'d like to say that I think this argument is
a little forced, you guys seem to be trying to rationalise a way to limit the
usefulness of lasers in  GDW\'s new (broken) design sequences. 

 Firstly, if the lasers could be made to move even slightly over the ships
surface while a hit is achieved the would continue to cause damage to
multiple ship components (in effect slicing the ship up, like a giant carving
knife).  This is quite likely as targetting of moving startships at BL/BR
distances and speeds is likely to be a process of continual correction, thus
the exact "point of impact" will vary over time.

Secondly, for similar reasons of imperfect targeting a MG\'s beam will not
necessarily all decay within the target.  It is obvious to me that if even a
fraction of the blast zone was actually inside the ship, it would cause
signifigant damage.  This sort of hit would, however cause less damage than
when the entire blast zone was contained within the ship.

Myself, I have no problem with the arbitary TL*50 rule to balance things out
(remembering that the lasers were artificially improved by use of gravatic
focusing).  Although I do agree with the Munro/Merrick discussion on the
difficulty of traning large mounts, perhaps this could get a bit complicated,
though.

     On the fringes of Regency space in the Spinward Marches lies 
     Mertactor, a nexus for mercantile activity.
     
     As a planet on the frontier, Mertactor is known for its free 
     spiritedness and lawlessness.  Felons fleeing the authority of the 
     Regency Navy, RQS and/or bounty hunters frequently stop off at 
     Mertactor on their way to the independent worlds and client states 
     spinward and rimward of the Regency.  Merchants carrying illegal goods 
     find Mertactor to be the ideal port to sell their wares.  For the 
     disenfranchised, disillusioned and disingenuous, Mertactor is the last 
     port on a journey to the outlands of unincorporated space.
     
     Mertactor was settled relatively late compared with the other worlds 
     of Plankwell Subsector.  It wasn\'t until 486 that the first colonist 
     set foot on the system mainworld\'s terra firma.  Formerly a possession 
     of Mora, Mertactor was designated as a place where the Morans could 
     stow their population overflow.  The Relocation Initiative of 486 was 
     not looked well upon by the unwilling colonists.  To villify the Moran 
     Matriarchs, the colonists named their world after the notorious 
     freebooter, Wilhelm Mertactor, who had raided, raped and pillaged the 
     Old and New Islands Subsectors of Reft in the twilight years of the 
     Ramshackle Empire.  An ambitious public relations campaign by the 
     Moran Matriarchs was demoralized and many a political career fell by 
     the wayside in the ensuing scandal.
     
     Surprisingly, the Mertactans refused the clemency of the Moran 
     government in 489, when they were offered repatriation as compensation 
     for their "unjust deportation."  The Mertactan colonists had become 
     accustomed to their small but verdant new home and the majority 
     decided to stay.  By appealing to the IISS Exploration department\'s 
     colonial bureau, Mertactor was granted independence.  Imperial 
     officials saw this as an opportunity to prevent the relocation scandal 
     from travelling all the way back to the Iridium Throne.  As part of 
     the deal, the IISS was allowed to establish a base on Mertactor.  It 
     wasn\'t until after the Fourth Frontier War that Mertactor finally 
     accepted overtures made by the Imperial Government to reapply for 
     membership.
     
     Descending from working-class deportees, Mertactans are proud of their 
     uncompromising heritage.  Mertactans tamed the wilds of their planet, 
     forging an advanced and forward-thinking society.  The Mertactan 
     Chamberlords reserved approximately 25 percent of the planet\'s 
     wilderness as preserves to avoid the ecological calamities that had 
     occurred elsewhere in the region due to reckless colonial bootstrap 
     programs.  The remaining portion of land was tendered to offworld 
     corporate interests with a mind to develop the planet\'s resources and 
     promote trade and industry.  In order to preserve their independence, 
     however, the Chamberlords carefully screened out any megacorporations, 
     megacorporate shadow companies and sectorwide corporations in order to 
     prevent a takeover attempt by any one corporate entity.
     
     Their conservative approach backfired and industry never really took 
     off on Mertactor.  Seeking to teach the upstart colonists a lesson, 
     the megacorporations had colluded with mid-sized corporations to 
     boycott the Mertactans.  Employing every type of coercion imaginable, 
     the megacorporations managed to squelch independent-minded investors 
     from circumventing the boycott.
     
     Undaunted, the Mertactan merchant fleet took the initiative and began 
     establishing trade agreements with the worlds of the Daryen 
     Confederation and the Sword Worlds.  Famous Mertactan free trader and 
     gambler Michaela Wallace took her business all the way to the fringes 
     of the Zhodani Consulate, and established trade ties with the Zhodani 
     that have survived numerous frontier wars and exist to this day.  
     While most of the early Spinward Marches colonies also traded with the 
     established interstellar governments of the region, few could dispute 
     that Mertactan mercantile savvy could open twice as many doors in half 
     the time.
     
     Modern Mertactan industry is essentially just subsistence for the 
     planet\'s lucrative mercantile sector.  Rather than a producer of 
     industrial or agricultural goods, Mertactans like to think of their 
     system as "the best damned conduit for trade in the Regency."
     
     Landing at Mertactor downport can be a harrowing experience.  The 
     unregulated close orbit and airspace of the planet are subject to more 
     accidents per capita than on any planet in the sector.  While there 
     are ample spaceports on the planet, only the B-quality facility in the 
     capital city of Seacheard and the C-quality installation in Kaydah 
     provide services for interstellar craft.
     
     While dodging free traders and air/rafts, visiting travellers will be 
     impressed by the lush earth and blue skies of Mertactor.  Thanks to an 
     absence of big industry and an abundance of scattered wilderness 
     preserves, the planet has been able to maintain its clean air and 
     natural landscape.  Due to the planet\'s rather small size and close 
     horizon, the clear azure skies seem to almost surround the reclining 
     viewer.
     
     Mertactor\'s thriving tourist industry offers a plethora of activities 
     to visiting travellers.  In the city of Seacheard, visitors will be 
     astonished by the beauty of the Daryen flame sculpture exhibit at the 
     Seacheard Museum of Art.  Donated by First Frontier war hero, Admiral 
     Koenig, the exhibit features some of the finest Daryen artwork to be 
     produced in the last millenium.  At the Colonial History Museum, 
     visitors may view artifacts, holovids and antique equipment from the 
     Spinward Marches\' colonial past.  Of particular note is an exhibition 
     featuring what the museum\'s curator claims are the original blueprints 
     for the Type-S scoutship prototype.  Children will enjoy visiting The 
     Wild Frontier, Seacheard\'s largest amusement park replete with an 
     imported Moran virtual reality entertainment center.
     
     Inghvernar, Mertactor\'s largest ocean, lies 280 km to the west of 
     Seacheard.  Mertactans on holiday flock to Inghvernar\'s golden 
     beaches.  Well-travelled offworlders will be less impressed by the 
     beachfront of this body of water which would only constitute a large 
     lake on most larger planets.  On Inghvernar\'s east coast is the 
     Lubvenar Fossil Museum, where travellers can discover the rich natural 
     history of Mertactor through an exhilariting series of exhibits and 
     holodynamic displays.
     
     Kaydah, the seat of government, features the impressive Mertactan 
     Legislature Building (MLB).  Constructed of reinforced synthetic 
     sandstone, this ivy-draped obelisk seems to thrust right out 
     Mertactor\'s terrestrial crust and through the planet\'s thick 
     equatorial jungle as if it had been there since time immemorial.  
     Standing atop Mount Aseldon, the MLB looks over the busy streets of 
     northern Kaydah like an alert sentry.
     
     On the southern end of the city, is the Plankwell Subsector Capital 
     Building.  Though the Capital\'s architecture is aesthetically pleasing 
     with its sharp edges and metallic industrial styling, political 
     representatives from throughout the subsector complain about the 
     dearth of office space in the building.  The building was intended to 
     be much larger when the subsector capital was set to be on neighboring 
     system, Collace.  However, when the Mertactan Chamberlords 
     successfully lobbied the Archduke to establish the capital on 
     Mertactor, they immediately contracted a local architecture firm to 
     design the building.  Due to the time constraints of the agreement, 
     the job was rushed, with the result being an attractive but largely 
     inadequate building.
     
     Despite the Mertactan historical animosity toward Mora, the native 
     government is rather obviously influenced by that of the domain 
     capital.  While not a matriarchy, women traditionally get preference 
     for most cabinet posts and tend to be elected to Chamberlord positions 
     at a rate of just over 60 percent on Mertactor.  The Chamberlords are 
     a select group of nine individuals, elected for lifelong terms by a 
     subordinate network of sheriffs, who are popularly elected by the 
     rather disproportionately sized counties of Mertactor.
     
     As befits any cosmopolitan world, the fashion and culture of Mertactor 
     are heavily influenced by visiting merchants and adventurers.  
     "Anything goes," is the motto on Mertactor.  One will find visiting 
     travellers sporting anything from traditional Vilani lagaash robes to 
     the virtual nudity of Glistenite tailored vaccsuits.  The jaded 
     Mertactans are nonchalant and accepting of such diversity.
     
     Perhaps the most outstanding educational establishment on the planet 
     is the Mertactor Mercantile Academy.  While the academy is on par with 
     most other Regency educational facilities for the most part, its 
     language department is outstanding.  Just about every language spoken 
     within 80 parsecs is taught at the academy, including each and every 
     vargr language in the extents.  The academy emphasizes cultural 
     behaviors and idiosynchrasies as well in order to train the ambitious 
     merchant cadet for any eventuality.
     
     As a result, Mertactan trading companies feature some of the most 
     finely trained personnel in the Regency.  Mertactan trading companies 
     are known to be quite bloodthirsty in their competition for business 
     insystem and will stop at nothing to obtain their goals.  The rather 
     ineffectual law enforcement administrations of Mertactor are unable to 
     prevent trading blocs and factions from colluding, bribing, embezzling 
     and on occasion shooting each other to death.  
     
     Within the last 80 years, the rimward encroachment of aslan ihatei has 
     had an interesting effect on the mercantile subculture.  Disputes 
     between trading companies are now frequently resolved by dueling.  
     Unfortunately, the aslan code of honor is absent in Mertactan dueling. 
     Shooting or stabbing one\'s opponent in the back or poisoning his food 
     the evening before the duel is not uncommon.
     
     Visiting free traders should not fear, however.  Oddly enough, the 
     virulence shown by one fellow Mertactan trader to another is not 
     extended to offworlders.  It is thought that a general sense of pity 
     for the poorly trained foreign trader makes him unworthy of such 
     treatment.  The prevailing attitude is "if he\'s not Mertactan, he\'s no 
     good at trading anyway!"  Though you\'ll never hear a Mertactan say 
     this in public!
     
     The Mertactan Free Trade Administration operates the planet\'s sole 
     orbital starport and city.  Built in 1004, FTA Orbital was originally 
     intended as a place where offworlders could comfortably trade without 
     having to make planetfall.  The idea never took hold with visiting 
     merchants, however, who thought they were being duped into trading at 
     the orbital facility so that native Mertactan merchant companies could 
     reap all the rewards of downside trade.  Declining public funds 
     resulted in the government\'s inability to properly maintain the 
     facility.  FTA Orbital quickly deteriorated into a D-level facility.  
     Ironically, trade traffic has actually increased over 300 percent at 
     FTA Orbital since the decline.  FTA Orbital now features the most 
     active black-market trade in the subsector.
     
     To coin an ancient Terran metaphor, Mertactor has a Jekyll-and-Hyde 
     culture.  To offworlders and potential trading partners, Mertactans 
     are amiable and welcoming, while to one another they are the most 
     vicious of opponents, professionally speaking.  While the divisiveness 
     of Mertactan society may appear anarchic or perhaps downright hostile, 
     it is embraced by Mertactans as an integral part of their culture.  To 
     survive in a universe fraught with danger and deception, Mertactans 
     believe that "It is better to do unto others before they do unto you."

Well, first off, The Traveller Adventure is NOT a boxed
set, "just" a 154 page softcover book.
The Spinward Marches Campaign is a smaller, separate
49-page sourcebook with with an adventure outline
stuck in.

Both are top notch, though TSMC mostly dwells on
the Marches military organization and the 
Fifth Fronteir War.  If that isn\'t of interest,
give it a pass.

Not to limit the usefulness of lasers, but improve the usefulness of MGs. 
with this train of thought the MGs will be a usefull weapon, not dead weight.

The danger with this is that you may only heat up parts of the hull and not 
damaging it.

If the DS is large enough, a near miss will be a hit. Maybe some sort of 
success level rule may fix this.
 Failure........miss
 Success........50% of DS volume
 Ex. Success....100% of DS volume


>Myself, I have no problem with the arbitary TL*50 rule to balance things out


Neither do I, but I doubt it will be official, and that it will be possible 
to enforce.

As far as I know the Traveller Adventure was not a boxed set but volume two
to
the Traveller Book, unless GDW Boxed the soft coppy of the Traveller book
with it.

>      "The Spinward Marches Campaign"?

This I purchased new when it first came out and can say that it was not a
part of any boxed set.

     On the fringes of Regency space in the Spinward Marches lies 
     Mertactor, a nexus for mercantile activity.
     
     As a planet on the frontier, Mertactor is known for its free 
     spiritedness and lawlessness.  Felons fleeing the authority of the 
     Regency Navy, RQS and/or bounty hunters frequently stop off at 
     Mertactor on their way to the independent worlds and client states 
     spinward and rimward of the Regency.  Merchants carrying illegal goods 
     find Mertactor to be the ideal port to sell their wares.  For the 
     disenfranchised, disillusioned and disingenuous, Mertactor is the last 
     port on a journey to the outlands of unincorporated space.
     
     Mertactor was settled relatively late compared with the other worlds 
     of Plankwell Subsector.  It wasn\'t until 486 that the first colonist 
     set foot on the system mainworld\'s terra firma.  Formerly a possession 
     of Mora, Mertactor was designated as a place where the Morans could 
     stow their population overflow.  The Relocation Initiative of 486 was 
     not looked well upon by the unwilling colonists.  To vilify the Moran 
     Matriarchs, the colonists named their world after the notorious 
     freebooter, Wilhelm Mertactor, who had raided, raped and pillaged the 
     Old and New Islands Subsectors of Reft in the twilight years of the 
     Ramshackle Empire.  An ambitious public relations campaign by the 
     Moran Matriarchs was demoralized and many a political career fell by 
     the wayside in the ensuing scandal.
     
     Surprisingly, the Mertactans refused the clemency of the Moran 
     government in 489, when they were offered repatriation as compensation 
     for their "unjust deportation."  The Mertactan colonists had become 
     accustomed to their small but verdant new home and the majority 
     decided to stay.  By appealing to the IISS Exploration department\'s 
     colonial bureau, Mertactor was granted independence.  Imperial 
     officials saw this as an opportunity to prevent the relocation scandal 
     from travelling all the way back to the Iridium Throne.  As part of 
     the deal, the IISS was allowed to establish a base on Mertactor.  It 
     wasn\'t until after the Fourth Frontier War that Mertactor finally 
     accepted overtures made by the Imperial Government to reapply for 
     membership.
     
     Descending from working-class deportees, Mertactans are proud of their 
     uncompromising heritage.  Mertactans tamed the wilds of their planet, 
     forging an advanced and forward-thinking society.  The Mertactan 
     Chamberlords reserved approximately 25 percent of the planet\'s 
     wilderness as preserves to avoid the ecological calamities that had 
     occurred elsewhere in the region due to reckless colonial bootstrap 
     programs.  The remaining portion of land was tendered to offworld 
     corporate interests with a mind to develop the planet\'s resources and 
     promote trade and industry.  In order to preserve their independence, 
     however, the Chamberlords carefully screened out any megacorporations, 
     megacorporate shadow companies and sectorwide corporations in order to 
     prevent a takeover attempt by any one corporate entity.
     
     Their conservative approach backfired and industry never really took 
     off on Mertactor.  Seeking to teach the upstart colonists a lesson, 
     the megacorporations had colluded with mid-sized corporations to 
     boycott the Mertactans.  Employing every type of coercion imaginable, 
     the megacorporations managed to squelch independent-minded investors 
     from circumventing the boycott.
     
     Undaunted, the Mertactan merchant fleet took the initiative and began 
     establishing trade agreements with the worlds of the Daryen 
     Confederation and the Sword Worlds.  Famous Mertactan free trader and 
     gambler Michaela Wallace took her business all the way to the fringes 
     of the Zhodani Consulate, and established trade ties with the Zhodani 
     that have survived numerous frontier wars and exist to this day.  
     While most of the early Spinward Marches colonies also traded with the 
     established interstellar governments of the region, few could dispute 
     that Mertactan mercantile savvy could open twice as many doors in half 
     the time.
     
     Modern Mertactan industry is essentially just subsistence for the 
     planet\'s lucrative mercantile sector.  Rather than a producer of 
     industrial or agricultural goods, Mertactans like to think of their 
     system as "the best damned conduit for trade in the Regency."
     
     Landing at Mertactor downport can be a harrowing experience.  The 
     unregulated close orbit and airspace of the planet are subject to more 
     accidents per capita than on any planet in the sector.  While there 
     are ample spaceports on the planet, only the B-quality facility in the 
     capital city of Seacheard and the C-quality installation in Kaydah 
     provide services for interstellar craft.
     
     While dodging free traders and air/rafts, visiting travellers will be 
     impressed by the lush earth and blue skies of Mertactor.  Thanks to an 
     absence of big industry and an abundance of scattered wilderness 
     preserves, the planet has been able to maintain its clean air and 
     natural landscape.  Due to the planet\'s rather small size and close 
     horizon, the clear azure skies seem to almost surround the reclining 
     viewer.
     
     Mertactor\'s thriving tourist industry offers a plethora of activities 
     to visiting travellers.  In the city of Seacheard, visitors will be 
     astonished by the beauty of the Daryen flame sculpture exhibit at the 
     Seacheard Museum of Art.  Donated by First Frontier war hero, Admiral 
     Koenig, the exhibit features some of the finest Daryen artwork to be 
     produced in the last millennium.  At the Colonial History Museum, 
     visitors may view artifacts, holovids and antique equipment from the 
     Spinward Marches\' colonial past.  Of particular note is an exhibition 
     featuring what the museum\'s curator claims are the original blueprints 
     for the Type-S scoutship prototype.  Children will enjoy visiting The 
     Wild Frontier, Seacheard\'s largest amusement park replete with an 
     imported Moran virtual reality entertainment center.
     
     Inghvernar, Mertactor\'s largest ocean, lies 280 km to the west of 
     Seacheard.  Mertactans on holiday flock to Inghvernar\'s golden 
     beaches.  Well-travelled offworlders will be less impressed by the 
     beachfront of this body of water which would only constitute a large 
     lake on most larger planets.  On Inghvernar\'s east coast is the 
     Lubvenar Fossil Museum, where travellers can discover the rich natural 
     history of Mertactor through an exhilarating series of exhibits and 
     holodynamic displays.
     
     Kaydah, the seat of government, features the impressive Mertactan 
     Legislature Building (MLB).  Constructed of reinforced synthetic 
     sandstone, this ivy-draped obelisk seems to thrust right out 
     Mertactor\'s terrestrial crust and through the planet\'s thick 
     equatorial jungle as if it had been there since time immemorial.  
     Standing atop Mount Aseldon, the MLB looks over the busy streets of 
     northern Kaydah like an alert sentry.
     
     On the southern end of the city, is the Plankwell Subsector Capital 
     Building.  Though the Capital\'s architecture is aesthetically pleasing 
     with its sharp edges and metallic industrial styling, political 
     representatives from throughout the subsector complain about the 
     dearth of office space in the building.  The building was intended to 
     be much larger when the subsector capital was set to be on neighboring 
     system, Collace.  However, when the Mertactan Chamberlords 
     successfully lobbied the Archduke to establish the capital on 
     Mertactor, they immediately contracted a local architecture firm to 
     design the building.  Due to the time constraints of the agreement, 
     the job was rushed, with the result being an attractive but largely 
     inadequate building.
     
     Despite the Mertactan historical animosity toward Mora, the native 
     government is rather obviously influenced by that of the domain 
     capital.  While not a matriarchy, women traditionally get preference 
     for most cabinet posts and tend to be elected to Chamberlord positions 
     at a rate of just over 60 percent on Mertactor.  The Chamberlords are 
     a select group of nine individuals, elected for lifelong terms by a 
     subordinate network of sheriffs, who are popularly elected by the 
     rather disproportionately sized counties of Mertactor.
     
     As befits any cosmopolitan world, the fashion and culture of Mertactor 
     are heavily influenced by visiting merchants and adventurers.  
     "Anything goes," is the motto on Mertactor.  One will find visiting 
     travellers sporting anything from traditional Vilani lagaash robes to 
     the virtual nudity of Glistenite tailored vaccsuits.  The jaded 
     Mertactans are nonchalant and accepting of such diversity.
     
     Perhaps the most outstanding educational establishment on the planet 
     is the Mertactor Mercantile Academy.  While the academy is on par with 
     most other Regency educational facilities for the most part, its 
     language department is outstanding.  Just about every language spoken 
     within 80 parsecs is taught at the academy, including each and every 
     vargr language in the extents.  The academy emphasizes cultural 
     behaviors and idiosyncrasies as well in order to train the ambitious 
     merchant cadet for any eventuality.
     
     As a result, Mertactan trading companies feature some of the most 
     finely trained personnel in the Regency.  Mertactan trading companies 
     are known to be quite bloodthirsty in their competition for business 
     insystem and will stop at nothing to obtain their goals.  The rather 
     ineffectual law enforcement administrations of Mertactor are unable to 
     prevent trading blocs and factions from colluding, bribing, embezzling 
     and on occasion shooting each other to death.  
     
     Within the last 80 years, the rimward encroachment of aslan ihatei has 
     had an interesting effect on the mercantile subculture.  Disputes 
     between trading companies are now frequently resolved by dueling.  
     Unfortunately, the aslan code of honor is absent in Mertactan dueling. 
      Shooting or stabbing one\'s opponent in the back or poisoning his food 
     the evening before the duel is not uncommon.
     
     Visiting free traders should not fear, however.  Oddly enough, the 
     virulence shown by one fellow Mertactan trader to another is not 
     extended to offworlders.  It is thought that a general sense of pity 
     for the poorly trained foreign trader makes him unworthy of such 
     treatment.  The prevailing attitude is "if he\'s not Mertactan, he\'s no 
     good at trading anyway!"  Though you\'ll never hear a Mertactan say 
     this in public!
     
     The Mertactan Free Trade Administration operates the planet\'s sole 
     orbital starport and city.  Built in 1004, FTA Orbital was originally 
     intended as a place where offworlders could comfortably trade without 
     having to make planetfall.  The idea never took hold with visiting 
     merchants, however, who thought they were being duped into trading at 
     the orbital facility so that native Mertactan merchant companies could 
     reap all the rewards of downside trade.  Declining public funds 
     resulted in the government\'s inability to properly maintain the 
     facility.  FTA Orbital quickly deteriorated into a D-level facility.  
     Ironically, trade traffic has actually increased over 300 percent at 
     FTA Orbital since the decline.  FTA Orbital now features the most 
     active black-market trade in the subsector.
     
     To coin an ancient Terran metaphor, Mertactor has a Jekyll-and-Hyde 
     culture.  To offworlders and potential trading partners, Mertactans 
     are amiable and welcoming, while to one another they are the most 
     vicious of opponents, professionally speaking.  While the divisiveness 
     of Mertactan society may appear anarchic or perhaps downright hostile, 
     it is embraced by Mertactans as an integral part of their culture.  To 
     survive in a universe fraught with danger and deception, Mertactans 
     believe that "It is better to do unto others before they do unto you."

    'body' => '     Answering Fred Kiesche\'s post about Hard Times:
     
     I can personally attest that it\'s an excellent adventure.  I conducted 
     it a few years back with the same crew of traders who I put through 
     Knightfall and it worked well as a continuation piece.  Knightfall 
     takes place during the early years of the Rebellion in Massilia Sector 
     and Hard Times sees the characters through the Black War and Collapse 
     years and right up to the end of the MegaTraveller Era in Diaspora 
     Sector.
     
     Hard Times, as I recall it, takes the adventurers through several 
     different types of mini-adventures including the following:
     
     -- Salvaging industrial materials at an abandoned warehouse in the 
     outback of a world.  Break out your Mission on Mithril book for this 
     one.  ATVs are the best mode of transportation.
     
     SPOILER ALERT (players, read no further!  Referees, go ahead):  Can 
     anyone say, "Aliens"?  A mysterious xenomorph awaits the players at 
     the warehouse.
     
     -- Rescuing the survivors of a backwater colony from a gang of 
     "rippers," pirates of the most vicious, bloodthirsty kind.
     
     -- A contract to provide security to a starport.  Sounds mundane, but 
     my players still remember this as the most memorable of all the 
     adventures in the book.
     
     -- An encounter with the increasingly xenophobic and violent 
     population of a planet while trying to obtain a serum for the planet\'s 
     medical facility.
     
     -- Acquisition and deployment of orbital defense satellites for the 
     Khavle Accordment, a Hard Times interstellar government that 
     apparently didn\'t have much success surviving into the New Era (all 
     the starports now have X\'s in 1201;  I take this as a pretty strong 
     indicator that my players\' efforts in 1126 were for naught!)
     
     -- The final battle, to which all the adventures build.  The 
     adventurers and their ship accompany a group of starmercs into battle 
     against the antagonists of Hard Times, a band of crafty pirates.
     
     
     Hard Times has a lively group of supporting characters and villains 
     and works well as a large group of independent adventures that combine 
     to form a cohesive story.  It could easily be converted to TNE, and I 
     daresay I wish I had had Brilliant Lances for the final battle.  I 
     always found MegaTraveller\'s space combat rules to be completely 
     cryptic.

They may have succeeded all too well - Virus probably acquired control
of the defensive system and used it to blast the planet to rubble...

As active as the proverbial extinct flightless bird or the Scandinavian

There are people working on Traveller software (e.g. myself occasionally and
Jo Grant in Ireland - he recently advertised his Cherryh 3D star-viewer on
TML/xboat) but no one seems to actually use this list.

Rick Hunt then asks:

If you can, post to engrg.uwo.ca or the MPGN site (ask Rob Miracle about
this?). Alternatively one of the WWW sites like Goeran\'s. If neither, please
ZIP, UUENCODE and e-mail it to me, at least!

of passenger available at a system.  It will also calculate the number of
freight lots and their sizes (limit 15 lots) and add up the amounts.  Since
there are a lot of random numbers generated and I didn\'t want the sheet
changing everytime I entered a number, I set it for manual calculate
(press F9).  Don\'t change anything in the boxes and you should be OK.

See the companion file cargo.zip for cargo price calculation.

Hi,

About a month ago I announced that my WWW pages would be down for a 
little while. Well, things turn out that they in fact migth not come 
back at all. Our site was hit by a hacker...

Nothing really harmfull for my pages in it self, but this particular 
hacker was of the pure evil breed. Apparently he installed a trojan 
horse type program that has trashed the harddiscs. At the moment we 
dont know if the data can be recovered. And ofcourse we dont have any

It does however seem that the user volume is the least damaged so I 
still have hopes. It will probably take some time to get everything 
in order again.

I\'ll keep you posted on furteher developments...

Starship blinding lasers.

	Here are 3 TL15 uncrewed, trainable lasers all with a damage
value of 1 out to 80 hexes. The first of these is included as it was the
design the other 2 were based on. Thee second is as overpowered as FF&S
explicitly allows and in the third the overpowering is extrapolated from
FF&S (rate of fire and focal array volume multiplied by 2 for each
additional negative difficulty level)  I set the thirds overpowering to
-15 diff because it can then hit, with a TL 15 MFD, a gigantic ship at
80 hexes and a small ship at 64, which is the greatest distance still
classed as long range for a 16 hex AEMS. Overpowering to more than -15
diff produces lasers which require stupidly big power plants compared to
there increased performance.
	I invisualise these lasers being used in large batteries of 20
to 200 lasers, controlled by one MFD, too blinded starships. Personally
I think a blinded starship without functioning communicators could not
jump, fire, evade or land.

Commander X here with a new toy for all the girls and boys!

and now....The Larch, (ehem...)

and Now for something Completely Different....
A Jump drive,
On a missle?

That right boys and girls, if we open our FF&Ses to page 42, under Important
Note, we see the
following statement:

"The smallest J-drive at any tech level is 2m^3 in volume."

My 1st thought was to create starfighters, jump capable fighters (which I
have done so).  But then
my devious little mind got working.  What If we could put that thing on a
missle or drone.  Jump it
to the system, launch the nukes off, and watch the planet go boom.
(sometimes I\'m so lucanic it
scares me!)

The phase II version has memory and tracking systems on it.  With a little
help from the sensor
operator and astrogator, on can figure out which jump vector a targeted ship
used, feed the data
to the missles computer, launch, set jump co-ords and engage(make it so
number one!).  Just
think, the PCs barely make it into j-space, nearly getting fragged by the
local forces.  7 days pass
by and the PCs recoup and heal.  The j-field gives way to stars once more,
then all of a sudden
*BOOM*  the ship is shredded by 6 x-ray blasts!
("There\'s always a boom tomorrow" -Cmdr. Ivanova)

So I suppose you techies out there want the stats for these things eh?(Egad!
the Commander\'s turning Canadian!)  Well, alright here they are:

The construction is very simple, almost modular:

1 Standard Ships missle         7m^3       1.25Mcr(TL-15)
1 J-drive                                 2m^3       0.60Mcr
H2 fuel for J-3                        30m^3       <price varies>
Sensors, computers and
other small stuff(TL-14/15)         1m^3      about 1 MegaCred

Total                                      50m^3      pertineer 3Mcr

Useage:
The targeting ship must have a sensor lock on the ship just before it
enteres j-space.  Using the
sensor data, the Astrogator can try to determine the vector and power of the
jump tumble. this is
an Imposible task using TL-9-11 Formidable at TL12-14 and Difficult at
TL15-17.  Tech level
effects show the sophistication of sensors and computer processing equipment
and general
knowledge of Jump physics.

After the data is inputed into the drones computer, the astrogator then
launches, makes shure the
bloodything is >100 diams a way, and engages the little beastie.  The crew
will never see that
drone again, and there is no way to know if it worked, except for
RNN(Regency News Network)=7F
posting that said ship was found badly damaged by fire, etc..etc..

Once in N-space the computer and sensors go online.  It will wait until it
detects something that
conforms to the sensor data in memory.  It will then relentlessly persue its
prey and then once it
is within 30,000 kicks *BOOM*

History:
During the Final war, most of the materiel for the war was in short supply.
Lucans secret
weapons R&D team came up with a little toy that was perfect for his Imperial
Magesty.  Instead of
using large ships to orbit a world and glass it over with nukes, whay not
just launch all the little
nukes in orbit with a J-drive?  Lucan giggled(Tee-Hee!) at the Idea and gave
the scientists the go
ahead.  by 1127 they had had a prototype and by 1128 they were a droppin\' on
Starports all over
the Outlands and Wilds.

Then in 1130 the virus came.

Yes, you guessed right boys and girls, the bloody things got infected.
Imagine entering a system
in the wilds with a missle whose sole purpose in life is to destroy any
Free-trader within range.
(Original programing said "This one Free-Trader" but we know what virus can
do to programming
now don\'t we ?)

Instellarms also came up with the Idea, but for another purpose,
Quarantene(sp?) patrol.
Having relocated their R&D facility to Efate(hey, where better to test
things, It\'s TL-14 and Law
Level 0!) Instellearms Corp got word of these little gems from the refugee
scientists who crossed
the claw.

By 1140 most RQS ships were packing at least one of these babies in their=
 hold.

Moral: Don\'t mess around with the RQS, you can run, but you can\'t hide!


Well, thats just about all for this installment boys and girls.

     That may be.  As I recall, the system was quite weak.  TL-11 missiles

True, CT an MT both make this clear, as a matter of fact I wondered if it
was a typo, if we corect m^3 to tons of displacement and ust the 1%+Jump#%
of volume equation we do get a min of 2tons dispalcement.  This would concur
with CT rules

However, FF&S states nothing about minimum volumes for ships and J-drives,
and I don\'t recal errata about it, so I\'m not looking a gift horse in the
mouth.

Please note that all the Ideas posted in Tales from the Line are completely
optional.  If you want to use the Jump missle and keep the FF&S ruling to
2m^3 thats fine, if you want to correct it to fit CT, 2tons, thats fine.


Please note that the next instalment of Tales from the Line will come
somtime next month.  I will be offline for about a week as I will be in
Pensylavania(SCA Pensic! Yahoo! :) )  Being a Medieval Reenactment Society,
and also lacking electricity, I will not be on a computer at all for the
duration.

Commander X goes off the air immediately.
good luck (hmmm, sounds familliar...)

(Kneeling as if for a humble request)

Could one of you "techies" out there please give me a ballpark generalization
for mass of stutterwarp drives?  Perhaps someone who still hold their 2300AD
collection.  I have failed to find mention of MASS anywhere in the
stutterwarp
design sequence of FFS.  Would it be comparable in density to a similarly
sized j-drive?

The beta verson of ChView (not a bad little program!) has induced me to build
a campaign of my own similar in "feel" to 2300AD, but quite different in
politics...  I can suspend disbelief of stuttering a little easier than I can
for j-ing.  ;)

Instead of using the patently contrived "discharge" limitation method for
stutterwarp from FFS/2300AD, would massive amounts of maintenance downtime
be plausible, time during which the drive MUST be disconnected from power
sources (or crew will be sacrificed to the gods of physics =)?  Are there
any other suggestions for limiting the range/efficiency of stutterwarp and/
or maintaining stellar/planetary bodies as choke points in interstellar
commerce/war?

Also, what sorts of technogizmickery could I replace the Tech Level
Multiplier
with, should I for some reason wish to have a universe in which strict "tech"
levels are not easily measurable (or useful)?  (<===  heresy! :)  What sorts
of technology would be the limiting/enabling factor(s) for stutterwarp?

Thank you, in advance, for your happy flames!!!

I recently purchased a book called _Combat Service Support Guide_, 2e, by MAJ

John E. Edwards (USA, Ret.), which seems to be a natural for anyone designing

a campaign.  It includes information on writing nuclear strike orders, 
prowords for radio communications (e.g., wilco, flash, etc.), the military 
decision making process, formulas for estimating ammunition/supply 
requirements for several types of supplies/units, map unit symbols, and much,

much more.  I bought it at a Borders bookstore, and it is easily worth the 
US$15 I paid for it.

Thought you might like to know.

The 2300 Star Cruiser design rules lists a mass for each drive volume -- a
quick division gives 1.176 tonnes/m^3.  I don\'t have time to look up the
details, but there are other parameters that vary beteen the 2300

Actually, I used to be in a campaign where we did something similar to
this.  Our party was hired by a merchant company that had a huge J-6
rider (we used to jokingly call it a merchant rider).  Individual
shipowners would do runs for the company by going from their ship to
individual worlds.

The big appeal for this was for merchants that had ships that weren\'t
jump capable.  The company was basically paying for the ships to
deliver goods to specific clients.  Our jump drive had broken down so
we went to work for these clowns to make money (they paid you per ton
hauled and had bonuses too boot).

The merchant riders were basically jump drive and cargo space.  Crew of
the individual ships would bunk on their ships.

Sure, all the time... if you build tenders which are less combat capable,
they make excellent large merchants which are easy to reincorporate into
the Navy if hostilities break out (run, don\'t walk, to the nearest Depot
or equivalent and grab the nearest rider squadron...).

Taking this a bit further, if you use riders and auxiliaries such as
troop landers etc. which are the same size, you can use the tenders in
multiple roles (rider tender, invasion lander tender, tanker, etc.)
by just swapping out the carried vehicles.

I asked this a few digests ago, but no-one replied. Certainly Jerry is

The maps in the article "History of the Spinward Marches" (published in
several CT modules) shows that Mertactor was settled by 300 (it dosen\'t
say how much earlier) and already independent. It was part of the jump-1 
route to Glisten (which was colonized in 298). Of the other worlds in 
District 268 (I suppose Plankwell is an official new name for it?) the 
worlds to trailing are shown as being within the settled area. Over half 
of the planets to spinward are not yet settled.

>Mertactor was designated as a place where the Morans could stow their

Have you ever tried calculating the amount of tonnage you need to export
a significant part of a planetary population? It\'s quite expensive even
if you export to a world just one jump-1 away. Expenses rise _rapidly_
if the "sinkhole" is more than one jump away. Mora to Mertactor is - let\'s
see, jump-4 hasen\'t been invented yet, has it? - NINE jumps by jump-3,
14 by jump-2. There\'s no way such an operation could have any useful
effect (Hmm.. Except as a phony propaganda stunt to give psycological
relief to the people at home (just like the Aslan ihatei expeditions).
That might work. But even then it dosen\'t make economic sense to send
them all the way to Mertactor. There were planets within two jumps-3 of
Mora that were outside the Imperium at the time.

The Old and New Islands Subsectors were unknown until a scout vessel
misjumped into them in... I forget the year, but it was quite recent.
The inhabitants had never heard of anyone from outside and noone outside
had heard of them.

Not a correction, just a comment: Mertactor is between 15 and 24% covered
with water. There can undoubtedly be lush and verdant spots on it, but 
overall the planet must be quite arid.

That\'s a neat trick! How did the lobby pull that one off? Collace must have
several hundred times the ressources to spare for lobbying than Mertactor.

RE:  \'ASTRONOMERS PREDICT FASTER THAN LIGHT SPACE TRAVEL\'

by Johnathan Leake, _The Sunday Times_, London,

13 August 1995, front page, lead story -

It is boldly going where no reputable scientific body has gone before.
Contradicting Einstein, the normally conservative Royal Astronomical
Society is about to publish a report predicting that mankind will be able
to travel faster than the speed of light. 

The breakthrough means that Star Trek fantasies of intersteller
civilisations and voyages powers by warp drive are now no longer the
exclusive domain of science fiction writers. 

The report was written by Ian Crawford, an astronomer at University
College London, who believes not only that man will one day see stars at
close quarters, but that we had better sart preparing ourselves for the
consequences, including contact with aliens. 

His paper, Some Thoughts on the Implications of Faster-Than-Light Travel,
has been validated by independent referees in the scientific community and
will be published next month. Its publication coincides with the formation
by British and American scientists of the Interstellar Propulsion Society
(IPS) which is dedicated to finding a means of taking astronauts to the
stars. 

Crawford argues that modern physics may allow two possible ways around
Einstein\'s theory, which says that because bodies have infinite mass at
the speed of light, no amount of energy can make them go faster. 

The first is to pass through "wormholes", rifts in the fabric of space
caused by intense gravitational fields such as those found around the
collapsed stars known as black holes. 

Crawford says that such fields may allow the traveller to enter a wormhole
from one point and then to leave it at another, possibly thousands of
light years away. 

Previously, scientists have assumed that any astronaut who was caught in
such a powerful gravitational field would be pulled into something
resembling a piece of spaghetti. 

However, Crawford said last week that recent research had suggested
wormholes could be stablised and manipulated to create short cuts between
any two points in space. "The proofs are complex and mathematical, but
more and more astrophysicists are satisfied that in theory it is
possible," he said. 

Should wormholes fail, however, Crawford proposes a second possible route
to the stars. He draws on a recent paper by Miguel Alcubierre, of the
University of Wales, in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity to
suggest the possibility of propulsion systems which distort space by
compressing it in front of a spaceship while expanding it behind. 

Such a system would effectively bend space, creating a form of "warp
drive" reminiscent of the Starship Enterprise of Captain James T. Kirk in
Star Trek. 

The theories will boost growing interest among scientists in the
possibility of travelling faster than light. The IPS, whose members
include several NASA engineers, starts its first conference shortly in
Halifax, Nova Scotia. 

Patrick Moore, the astronomer and presenter of The Sky At Night, said he
believed interstellar travel would one day be achieved. "Television would
have seemed impossible 200 years ago and faster than light travel is no
more outrageous than that," he said. 

Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer and futurologist, was equally
enthusiastic. His first novel, Against the Fall of Night, presumed that
man would be able to travel faster than light. Speaking from his home in
Colombo, Sri Lanka, he said: "That was just a dramatic device which all
science fiction writers have to use in space travel, but I have always
believed it may one day be possible." 

Sir Martin Rees, the Astronomer Royal and Professor of Astronomy at
Cambridge University, was more cautious, however, saying the proofs were
purely theoretical.

    'body' => '     I am trying to re-engineer a Pulse Rifle (from Aliens) using FF&S, but 
     it has ended up about twice the weight it should do (using "ALiens, 
     Colonial Marines Technical Manual" by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood and the 
     Aliens RPG by the Phoenix Command people as reference).
     
     Most of the weight is in the receiver and magazine (to hold 99 or 95 
     rounds).  I seem to remember that someone posted information on 
     lighter weight materials for FF&S designs.  Could you please e-mail me 
     with that info, again.
     
     There doesn\'t seem to be any differentiation made between cased and 
     caseless ammo in FF&S (other than a comment saying all non-ETC ammo 
     above a certain TL will be caseless).  Has anyone come up with their 
     own rules?
     
     I\'ll post the final design to the list when I finish it.
     
     Next, the M56 Smart Gun (what do you mean "Inertial Compensators are

    'body' => '     First, let me thank Hans for his corrections and suggestions.  They 
     are much appreciated.  I\'ll repost Mertactor with some modifications.  
     But first, let me indulge myself by addressing each of his concerns in 
     turn:
     
     >>The maps in the article "History of the Spinward Marches" (published 
     in several CT modules) shows that Mertactor was settled by 300 (it 
     dosen\'t say how much earlier) and already independent. It was part of 
     the jump-1 route to Glisten (which was colonized in 298). Of the other 
     worlds in District 268 (I suppose Plankwell is an official new name 
     for it?) the worlds to trailing are shown as being within the settled 
     area. Over half of the planets to spinward are not yet settled.<<
     
     Not necessarily.  I defer to the Tarsus boxed set which states (I 
     think) that Tarsus, which is only a few parsecs away from Mertactor, 
     wasn\'t settled until some time in the 400s.  It takes years to 
     establish these colonies and many habitable worlds were left 
     uncolonized for years.  The maps to which you\'re referring show 
     _areas_ that were colonized by 300, not the specific worlds.
     
     Plankwell is the name used by Leroy Guatney in his "semi-official" 
     1201 listings for the Spinward Marches, posted in the Genie RPG 
     section last December.
     
     >>Have you ever tried calculating the amount of tonnage you need to 
     export a significant part of a planetary population? It\'s quite 
     expensive even if you export to a world just one jump-1 away. Expenses 
     rise _rapidly_ if the "sinkhole" is more than one jump away. Mora to 
     Mertactor is - let\'s see, jump-4 hasen\'t been invented yet, has it? - 
     NINE jumps by jump-3, 14 by jump-2. There\'s no way such an operation 
     could have any useful effect (Hmm.. Except as a phony propaganda stunt 
     to give psycological relief to the people at home (just like the Aslan 
     ihatei expeditions).<<
     
     Or a propaganda stunt to discourage _more_ colonists from coming to 
     Mora from the more settled regions of Imperial space.
     
     I didn\'t say Mora picked up the tab.  Maybe the colonists had to trade 
     tons of their colonization goods to buy more fuel to get them to their 
     new home.
     
     I don\'t think the tonnage needs to be calculated.  The colonists have 
     already done it for me when they calculated the tonnage to move 
     themselves from their former homes in the established Imperium.
     
     Yes, the numbers are astronomical, but have you ever considered what 
     it must\'ve cost the Sword Worlders to immigrate from Terra?!  Now that 
     must\'ve been a pretty penny.  Expeditions are often undertaken with 
     little consideration for the financial costs.  Just ask Kevin Costner. 
      
     Often, such decisions are based on emotion.  It is my feeling that 
     Morans began to feel a bit xenophobic due to mass immigration to their 
     world.  If the Morans _did_ foot the bill, perhaps they felt that, at 
     any cost, it was worth the effort to relieve their burgeoning 
     population pressure.
     
     >>That might work. But even then it dosen\'t make economic sense to 
     send them all the way to Mertactor. There were planets within two 
     jumps-3 of Mora that were outside the Imperium at the time.<<
     
     My take on it was that many of the worlds were reserved for 
     colonization by people outside the Deneb region.  Sort of like 
     claim-stakers who filed for their colonies back on Core or something.  
     Perhaps Mertactor was unclaimed as yet and the other worlds, nearer to 
     Mora, _were_ claimed.
     
     >>The Old and New Islands Subsectors were unknown until a scout vessel 
     misjumped into them in... I forget the year, but it was quite recent. 
     The inhabitants had never heard of anyone from outside and noone 
     outside had heard of them.<<
     
     Whoops.  Where\'s that?  Trillion Credit Squadron?  I knew I shouldn\'t 
     have sold that book! <g>  Reft\'ll have to be changed to Gushemege or 
     Dagudashag. Thanks for enlightening me.
     
     >>Not a correction, just a comment: Mertactor is between 15 and 24% 
     covered with water. There can undoubtedly be lush and verdant spots on 
     it, but overall the planet must be quite arid.<<
     
     True, but it\'s also a very small world.  Size 2 if memory serves.  It 
     wouldn\'t take much in the way of water or atmosphere to make it a lush 
     place.  Maybe the molten core of the planet feeds the surface with 
     chemically rich soil or something.  You just gotta use your 
     imagination!
     
     >>Re:  Lobbying Imperial/Regency officials to select Mertactor as 
     subsector capital.
     
     Hans:  That\'s a neat trick! How did the lobby pull that one off? 
     Collace must have several hundred times the ressources to spare for 
     lobbying than Mertactor.<<
     
     Well, you know what they say about friends in high places! <g>  
     Seriously though, I referred to the Tarsus boxed set which said that 
     Collace was being considered as the capital of the subsector.  When I 
     read in my updated 1201 stats that Mertactor was chosen (a nice big 
     "Cp" appears next to Mertactor), I figured it had to be some sort of 
     irregularity that influenced Imperial or Regency officials to select 
     Mertactor over Collace.  Hence, the lobbying method (read: bribery).
     
     >>      Within the last 80 years, the rimward encroachment of aslan 
     ihatei <<
     
     I don\'t quite understand you here.  However, in defense of this 
     statement, Plankwell Subsector _is_ on the rimward edge of the 
     Spinward Marches.  Less than 20 parsecs away, the aslan have 
     completely usurped entire systems.  In tribute to Alvin Plummera\'s 
     mention of the aslan on Glisten, I thought I\'d maintain a bit of 
     continuity between RICE papers and mention them.
     
     
     Now that I\'m out of defensive position, I\'ll make a general statement: 
     RICE papers are intended to be a guide where little or no detailed 
     cultural information has been presented before.  I think I speak for 
     everyone who has contributed at least one of these papers when I say 
     feel free to leave as much of these RICE papers as you like on the 
     cutting room floor.  Or disregard the whole thing!
     
     I\'ve collected the other RICE papers that folks have done on the TML 
     and I think they\'re great.  I\'ve modified them where necessary to fit 
     my own campaign or where I didn\'t like what the author has stated, but 
     all in all, I appreciate that someone else has done the legwork for 
     the most part.
     
     That said, let\'s see some more RICE papers from others on the TML.  
     Hans, I haven\'t seen you contribute one yet.  Have at, pal!  There are 
     hundreds of worlds we need to know more about.

     On the fringes of Regency space in the Spinward Marches lies 
     Mertactor, a nexus for mercantile activity.
     
     As a planet on the frontier, Mertactor is known for its free 
     spiritedness and lawlessness.  Felons fleeing the authority of the 
     Regency Navy, RQS and/or bounty hunters frequently stop off at 
     Mertactor on their way to the independent worlds and client states 
     spinward and rimward of the Regency.  Merchants carrying illegal goods 
     find Mertactor to be the ideal port to sell their wares.  For the 
     disenfranchised, disillusioned and disingenuous, Mertactor is the last 
     port on a journey to the outlands of unincorporated space.
     
     Mertactor was settled relatively late compared with the other worlds 
     of Plankwell Subsector.  It wasn\'t until 486 that the first colonist 
     set foot on the system mainworld\'s terra firma.  Formerly a possession 
     of Mora, Mertactor was designated as a place where the Morans could 
     stow their population overflow.  The Relocation Initiative of 486 was 
     not looked well upon by the unwilling colonists.  To vilify the Moran 
     Matriarchs, the colonists named their world after the notorious 
     freebooter, Wilhelm Mertactor, who had raided, raped and pillaged the 
     spinward regions of Dagudashag sector in the twilight years of the 
     Ramshackle Empire.  An ambitious public relations campaign by the 
     Moran Matriarchs was demoralized and many a political career fell by 
     the wayside in the ensuing scandal.
     
     Surprisingly, the Mertactans refused the clemency of the Moran 
     government in 489, when they were offered repatriation as compensation 
     for their "unjust deportation."  The Mertactan colonists had become 
     accustomed to their small but verdant new home and the majority 
     decided to stay.  By appealing to the IISS Exploration department\'s 
     colonial bureau, Mertactor was granted independence.  Imperial 
     officials saw this as an opportunity to prevent the relocation scandal 
     from travelling all the way back to the Iridium Throne.  As part of 
     the deal, the IISS was allowed to establish a base on Mertactor.  It 
     wasn\'t until after the Fourth Frontier War that Mertactor finally 
     accepted overtures made by the Imperial Government to reapply for 
     membership.
     
     Descending from working-class deportees, Mertactans are proud of their 
     uncompromising heritage.  Mertactans tamed the wilds of their planet, 
     forging an advanced and forward-thinking society.  The Mertactan 
     Chamberlords reserved approximately 25 percent of the planet\'s 
     wilderness as preserves to avoid the ecological calamities that had 
     occurred elsewhere in the region due to reckless colonial bootstrap 
     programs.  The remaining portion of land was tendered to offworld 
     corporate interests with a mind to develop the planet\'s resources and 
     promote trade and industry.  In order to preserve their independence, 
     however, the Chamberlords carefully screened out any megacorporations, 
     megacorporate shadow companies and sectorwide corporations in order to 
     prevent a takeover attempt by any one corporate entity.
     
     Their conservative approach backfired and industry never really took 
     off on Mertactor.  Seeking to teach the upstart colonists a lesson, 
     the megacorporations had colluded with mid-sized corporations to 
     boycott the Mertactans.  Employing every type of coercion imaginable, 
     the megacorporations managed to squelch independent-minded investors 
     from circumventing the boycott.
     
     Undaunted, the Mertactan merchant fleet took the initiative and began 
     establishing trade agreements with the worlds of the Daryen 
     Confederation and the Sword Worlds.  Famous Mertactan free trader and 
     gambler Michaela Wallace took her business all the way to the fringes 
     of the Zhodani Consulate, and established trade ties with the Zhodani 
     that have survived numerous frontier wars and exist to this day.  
     While most of the early Spinward Marches colonies also traded with the 
     established interstellar governments of the region, few could dispute 
     that Mertactan mercantile savvy could open twice as many doors in half 
     the time.
     
     Modern Mertactan industry is essentially just subsistence for the 
     planet\'s lucrative mercantile sector.  Rather than a producer of 
     industrial or agricultural goods, Mertactans like to think of their 
     system as "the best damned conduit for trade in the Regency."
     
     Landing at Mertactor downport can be a harrowing experience.  The 
     unregulated close orbit and airspace of the planet are subject to more 
     accidents per capita than on any planet in the sector.  While there 
     are ample spaceports on the planet, only the B-quality facility in the 
     capital city of Seacheard and the C-quality installation in Kaydah 
     provide services for interstellar craft.
     
     While dodging free traders and air/rafts, visiting travellers will be 
     impressed by the lush earth and blue skies of Mertactor.  Thanks to an 
     absence of big industry and an abundance of scattered wilderness 
     preserves, the planet has been able to maintain its clean air and 
     natural landscape.  Due to the planet\'s rather small size and close 
     horizon, the clear azure skies seem to almost surround the reclining 
     viewer.
     
     Mertactor\'s thriving tourist industry offers a plethora of activities 
     to visiting travellers.  In the city of Seacheard, visitors will be 
     astonished by the beauty of the Daryen flame sculpture exhibit at the 
     Seacheard Museum of Art.  Donated by First Frontier war hero, Admiral 
     Koenig, the exhibit features some of the finest Daryen artwork to be 
     produced in the last millennium.  At the Colonial History Museum, 
     visitors may view artifacts, holovids and antique equipment from the 
     Spinward Marches\' colonial past.  Of particular note is an exhibition 
     featuring what the museum\'s curator claims are the original blueprints 
     for the Type-S scoutship prototype.  Children will enjoy visiting The 
     Wild Frontier, Mertactor\'s largest amusement park replete with an 
     imported Moran virtual reality entertainment center.
     
     Inghvernar, Mertactor\'s largest ocean, lies 280 km to the west of 
     Seacheard.  Mertactans on holiday flock to Inghvernar\'s golden 
     beaches.  Well-travelled offworlders will be less impressed by the 
     beachfront of this body of water which would only constitute a large 
     lake on most larger planets.  On Inghvernar\'s east coast is the 
     Lubvenar Fossil Museum, where travellers can discover the rich natural 
     history of Mertactor through an exhilarating series of exhibits and 
     holodynamic displays.
     
     Kaydah, the seat of government, features the impressive Mertactan 
     Legislature Building (MLB).  Constructed of reinforced synthetic 
     sandstone, this ivy-draped obelisk seems to thrust right out 
     Mertactor\'s terrestrial crust and through the planet\'s thick 
     equatorial jungle as if it had been there since time immemorial.  
     Standing atop Mount Aseldon, the MLB looks over the busy streets of 
     northern Kaydah like an alert sentry.
     
     On the southern end of the city is the Plankwell Subsector Capital 
     Building.  Though the Capital\'s architecture is aesthetically pleasing 
     with its sharp edges and metallic industrial styling, political 
     representatives from throughout the subsector complain about the 
     dearth of office space in the building.  The building was intended to 
     be much larger when the subsector capital was set to be on neighboring 
     system, Collace.  However, when the Mertactan Chamberlords 
     successfully lobbied the Archduke to establish the capital on 
     Mertactor, they immediately contracted a local architecture firm to 
     design the building.  Due to the time constraints of the agreement, 
     the job was rushed, with the result being an attractive but largely 
     inadequate building.
     
     Despite the Mertactan historical animosity toward Mora, the native 
     government is rather obviously influenced by that of the domain 
     capital.  While not a matriarchy, women traditionally get preference 
     for most cabinet posts and tend to be elected to Chamberlord positions 
     at a rate of just over 60 percent on Mertactor.  The Chamberlords are 
     a select group of nine individuals, elected for lifelong terms by a 
     subordinate network of sheriffs, who are popularly elected by the 
     rather disproportionately sized counties of Mertactor.
     
     As befits any cosmopolitan world, the fashion and culture of Mertactor 
     are heavily influenced by visiting merchants and adventurers.  
     "Anything goes," is the motto on Mertactor.  One will find visiting 
     travellers sporting anything from traditional Vilani lagaash robes to 
     the virtual nudity of Glistenite tailored vaccsuits.  The jaded 
     Mertactans are nonchalant and accepting of such diversity.
     
     Perhaps the most outstanding educational establishment on the planet 
     is the Mertactor Mercantile Academy.  While the academy is on par with 
     most other Regency educational facilities for the most part, its 
     language department is outstanding.  Just about every language spoken 
     within 80 parsecs is taught at the academy, including each and every 
     vargr language in the extents.  The academy emphasizes cultural 
     behaviors and idiosyncrasies as well in order to train the ambitious 
     merchant cadet for any eventuality.
     
     As a result, Mertactan trading companies feature some of the most 
     finely trained personnel in the Regency.  Mertactan trading companies 
     are known to be quite bloodthirsty in their competition for business 
     insystem and will stop at nothing to obtain their goals.  The rather 
     ineffectual law enforcement administrations of Mertactor are unable to 
     prevent trading blocs and factions from colluding, bribing, embezzling 
     and on occasion shooting each other to death.  
     
     Within the last 80 years, the rimward encroachment of aslan ihatei has 
     had an interesting effect on the mercantile subculture.  Disputes 
     between trading companies are now frequently resolved by dueling.  
     Unfortunately, the aslan code of honor is absent in Mertactan dueling. 
     Shooting or stabbing one\'s opponent in the back or poisoning his food 
     the evening before the duel is not uncommon.
     
     Visiting free traders should not fear, however.  Oddly enough, the 
     virulence shown by one fellow Mertactan trader to another is not 
     extended to offworlders.  It is thought that a general sense of pity 
     for the poorly trained foreign trader makes him unworthy of such 
     treatment.  The prevailing attitude is "if he\'s not Mertactan, he\'s no 
     good at trading anyway!"  Though you\'ll never hear a Mertactan say 
     this in public!
     
     The Mertactan Free Trade Administration operates the planet\'s sole 
     orbital starport and city.  Built in 1004, FTA Orbital was originally 
     intended as a place where offworlders could comfortably trade without 
     having to make planetfall.  The idea never took hold with visiting 
     free traders, however, who thought they were being duped into trading 
     at the orbital facility so that native Mertactan merchant companies 
     could reap all the rewards of downside trade with subsector- and 
     sector-wide lines.  Declining public funds resulted in the 
     government\'s inability to properly maintain the facility.  FTA Orbital 
     quickly deteriorated into a D-level facility.  Ironically, trade 
     traffic has actually increased over 300 percent at FTA Orbital since 
     the decline, which now features the most active black-market trade in 
     the subsector.
     
     To coin an ancient Terran metaphor, Mertactor has a Jekyll-and-Hyde 
     culture.  To offworlders and potential trading partners, Mertactans 
     are amiable and welcoming, while to one another they are the most 
     vicious of opponents, professionally speaking.  While the divisiveness 
     of Mertactan society may appear anarchic or perhaps downright hostile, 
     it is embraced by Mertactans as an integral part of their culture.  To 
     survive in a universe fraught with danger and deception, Mertactans 
     believe that "It is better to do unto others before they do unto you."

  I\'ve used surplus Battleriders in my campaign as an alternate means of 
transport between high-pop worlds (cheaper for the small traders who hook 
their ships on, plus it saves wear and tear on the drives) and as a means 
of bypassing a dangerous or unprofitable section of space (linking two J-1
mains, for example).  I\'ve also use them as background, carrying 
enourmous standard containers on fixed runs - the sort of thing you

Yes, it is still in production. I think issue 11 is due out some time
soonish. Subscriptions are 7.50 UK pounds for UK residents and 10.00 UKP for
overseas. That\'s 3 issues which I think is about 1 year.

I don\'t believe Signal-GK has a US or Canada distributor at the moment nor
are you likely to find it in the shops.

They are NOT on e-mail but to save you trans-pond postage, I can relay info
if you want to e-mail it to me (I have started writing for Signal-GK as well
as the Traveller Chronicle).

As regards Writing Guidelines for S-GK, they will accept material for any
era although each issue tends to concentrate on an area of Dagudashaag
sector and thus has some sort of theme. They are looking for people to write
sector data: try thinking up something new for the 299th planet in the
subsector, etc... ;-)

And yes, I quite agree with you: it\'s an excellent magazine for the price.
Okay, so they don\'t bother with a colour cover, but the contents
(particularly the alien races) are really good and thoroughly detailed.

    'body' => 'Penetrating Problems

	I\'ve been wondering what happens when a character gets shot with
a high penetration weapon. What started me wondering is this: characters
using innocent bystanders as human shields and hostages.
	If say I gave a human body an armour value of 3 then shot it
with a fusion gun with a damage value of 15 I reckon from the rules the
body would suffer 3D6 wounds (ave 10.5 wounds) and the person tacking
the hostage would take 3+3D6 wounds (ave 13.5 wounds which now includes
blunt trauma). However the rules in TNE would suggest that all the 15
dice of damage would be taken by the hostage. Setting it to 5 would give
respectively 5d6 (17.5) and 5+5D6 (22.5), and if the hostage tacker was
wearing something with armour value 5 they would take 10+5D6 (27.5)?
	As high penetration weapons will pretty obviously go though
people it may be wise to adopt an armour value for an average person
(maybe 3 to 7). I think it could have one of two big affects on play.
one: players abandoning dreams of MPFGs or two: them not wearing there
armour (and keeping within a budget) It would also give a point where
relay heavy armour would become counterproductive. It still leaves the
problem of of one of them (my flat mate and the only person to relay
cause me problems as a GM) quitting my game because I wouldn\'t let his
character have a grav tank and a Fiery class close escort (he\'s already
lost a Gazelle).

The 100-ton rule is official only in CT & MT, as far as I know.  The "2 m^3
rule"
for jump drives in FF&S was received with howls of delight around here,
as it made things like the "Leviathan"\'s jump torpedoes and Scott "2G"
Kellogg\'s 20-ton Cessna Jump Trainer legal and possible.  Why bother
asking GDW?  It\'s your campaign, right?  If you want micro-starships,
use the "2m^3 minimum" rule; if you don\'t, rule that 100-tons is the minimum 
size for a starship.  Ditto for big lasers...

Our "700-year-after" campaign setting and Steve\'s TNE/TCS game (same setting,
really) use the "2 m^3" rule; one can build very small scoutships that way.

I think you\'ll find that it was a battle damaged cruiser that misjumped.
They had to manufacture jump drive components to get back.
When the official scout service contact mission arrived they found that the

I agree that you could make a good case for a planet like, say, Weiss or
Windsor (which lies in the middle of the area shown as settled) not 
necessarily being settled at the time shown, but Mertactor lies on the
edge of the border shown. It may be too complicated to show non-settled
worlds in the middle of an area, but it\'s quite simple to draw a border
either way around a border world. Surely the edge would\'ve been on the 
other side of Mertactor if it had been unsettled. (Tarsus dosen\'t prove
anything as it IS on the other side of the egde in the 300 and 400 map
AND is shown as settled on the 500 map. Which fits perfectly with what
other knowledge we have.)

I don\'t quite catch your drift here.

But if it isn\'t Moran citizens being booted off planet, whet\'s their beef?
Surely they neither needed, nor wanted to settle on an already inhabited
planet if the had a whole colonization ship with them.

Try. It gives one a healthy sense of proportions.

Again, I don\'t see why emigrants from, say, Deneb, with their very own
colonization ship can be said to come from Mora if all the contact they
have with that planet is being gouged a bit on the fuel bill (and believe
me, there\'s a very definite limit to how much the Morans _could_ gouge
them before someone else started shippin in fuel from Jokotre and under-
cutting them).

Yes, but that was colonization, not population pressure relief.

Nonsens. Someone will have to foot the bill, and that someone will have to

That one went right by me. Didn\'t even see it.

But you\'re mixing up two different kinds of colonization. One is what the
Sword Worlders may have done: bought a ship and set off into the wild blue
yonder, never to return (In own my universe the SWs were the remnants of
a defeated fleet, so they didn\'t pay for their ships, but that\'s not
official). That sort of colonization is very expensive. Something like
MCr 10 per colonist, I think (if I haven\'t misremembered my calculations
on the subject of _ihatei_). That\'s the yearly naval budget of _20,000_
people to send off ONE colonist. Do you really think any government would
be willing to spend that kind of money just to get rid of an insignificant
part of their population? I don\'t. The other kind is where you (the 
government) build a ship, load it with people (volunteers or "volunteers"),
send it to some other planet, dump the people, _and comes home for another
load to repeat the process_. Now you _may_ be getting into something
managable. Now we\'re not just building a ship and waving goodbye to it.
Now we\'re keeping the ship and getting rid of the people for the yearly
maintenance cost, which is 1/10th the purchase price. If you ship to a
planet jump-1 away you can get in 25 trips a year, which brings the total
down to Cr 40,000 per subject (less, because the ship I used to calculate
this with was an aslan jump-3 design; with jump-1 engines and drop tanks
you could propably pack in 25% more people). That\'s still pretty stiff, but 
not unbeliveably so. After all, this might even truly help the population 
pressure, always provided you impose strict population control (but I always 
assume that, anyway). But the moment you move farther afield the price goes
up. Double the number of jumps needed and you reduce the number of trips
your ship can make per year. For a planet 9 jumps away the price is 4 times
as much (AND, perhaps even more significantly, the number of people you can

Dosen\'t quite sound like the free and easy Spinward Marches I\'ve read

just say: "Well, maybe."

No, it wouldn\'t. But that little water isn\'t there. 20% of a planet\'s
surface is 20%, big or small. Two planets with the same hydrographic
percentage is roughly equally lush/arid. (I speak subject to correction
by anyone who knows anything about the subject).

But if so then it\'s an unusual feature of the planet and deserves to be
mentioned. (Anyway, you can stuff the soils with chemicals as much as
you like; without water it\'s going to be a desert).

It\'s just that I and several others firmly believe that if everything GDW
has told us about the basic situation of the Aslans (TL, culture, etc.) and 
the way shipbuilding economy works is taken seriously, then there\'s NO way
the Aslans could even begin to encroach on the Domain back in 1116 much
less actually capture a high-population TL 15 world. And even if by some
bizarrely impropable concatenation of events (one that none of us has had
the highly inventive imagination to concieve) they did manage to grab hold
of Glisten or Tobia there\'s no way that Norris would accept such a situation,
nor any reason why he should, since he would have all the ressources he
needed to kick them off again. (Well, I suppose that if the Aslans managed
to grab Glisten and Tobia without damaging the defenses AND take over those
defenses then Norris would have some grey hairs coming. Now all you have
to do is to come up with a scenario that allows the Aslans to sneak in and
steal a few score fully manned TCSquadrons and system defenses. Good luck.)

This has been discussed several times before (not heatedly, because we\'re
a pretty laid-back bunch of people here on TML, but intensely), so I 
didn\'t want to rip it up again, but I always vince when I see references
to Aslans lording it over Glisten or any other Domain/Regency world.

Sure. It\'s just that I firmly believe that in an "shared universe" like
GDWs Traveller Universe it is not only polite to make every effort
to fit your new material to what has been produced before, it is also,
in the long run, the most expedient thing to do.

	Could you inform me as well?  Or perhaps just post it to the list? 
I saw the article describing the Alcubierre drive and I\'ve been thinking how
it might be adapted to Trav.  Unfortunately, my knowledge of physics is 
limited. I\'ll give a brief description of the drive in the hopes of 
provoking discussion :)
	The drive creates a local distortion of spacetime that creates and
expansion behind the ship and a corresponding contraction in front of the
ship.  This leaves the ship in free-fall and gives it no "real" 
acceleration in that it does not suffer time dilation.  However the ship
does gain "coordinate" acceleration in that it moves.  Because the ship
stays within its local light cone (the light, and everything within the
radius of the disturbance is also accelerated) the ship can travel much
faster than light (relative to a stationary observer at the ships starting
point).  In fact, Alcubierre postulates that the ship could travel almost
instantaneously.
	There are some curious things about the drive though.  For 
instance, the article states that halfway to its destination, the ship 
must perform a familiar turn-over maneuver to accelerate in the opposite 
direction.  What if the drive failed before turn-over, would the ship 
continue traveling at FTL speeds essentially forever?  Would it be 
destroyed?  And what about the ships local light cone?  If it is being 
accelerated also then it will quickly leave the region of the disturbance 
and begin to move more slowly than the space craft, allowing the ship to 
catch up and the light to be caught in the disturbance again.  This would 
seem to my layman\'s eyes to create something analogous to a sonic boom 
coming from the ship.
	There are of course many other interesting things about a ship 
which travels in this fashion, and since, according to Shalom Zaidfeld 
this idea is gaining scientific recognition, this may be the way humanity 
someday reaches the stars.

    'from' => 'Christopher Griffen',
    'body' => '     Hans and my continuing discussion about my Mertactor RICE paper:
     
     
     >>I agree that you could make a good case for a planet like, say, 
     Weiss or Windsor (which lies in the middle of the area shown as 
     settled) not necessarily being settled at the time shown, but 
     Mertactor lies on the edge of the border shown. It may be too 
     complicated to show non-settled worlds in the middle of an area, but 
     it\'s quite simple to draw a border either way around a border world. 
     Surely the edge would\'ve been on the other side of Mertactor if it had 
     been unsettled. (Tarsus dosen\'t prove anything as it IS on the other 
     side of the egde in the 300 and 400 map AND is shown as settled on the 
     500 map. Which fits perfectly with what other knowledge we have.)<<
     
     Mertactor\'s _right_ on the edge of Regency space.  I interpret that to 
     mean that it is on the very edge of what was Imperial space.  I 
     believe that supports my argument that it could\'ve been one of the 
     _last_ systems to be settled.
     
     >>Chris:>Or a propaganda stunt to discourage _more_ colonists from 
     coming to >Mora from the more settled regions of Imperial space.
     
     Hans:  I don\'t quite catch your drift here.<<
     
     My intent is to express that Mora could be trying to set an example 
     for other would-be colonists.  Many billions more could be applying 
     for their Moran visas through civilized space.  If news of this 
     arguably expensive deportation gets out, it could save Moran citizens 
     from what they perceive to be far greater expenses in overcrowding and 
     pollution.
     
     Part of the allure of the frontier would be the wide open spaces.  
     That\'s why so many colonists came to the Americas initially.  I don\'t 
     see why it shouldn\'t apply on an interstellar scale.
     
     >>But if it isn\'t Moran citizens being booted off planet, whet\'s their 
     beef? Surely they neither needed, nor wanted to settle on an already 
     inhabited planet if the had a whole colonization ship with them.<<
     
     Unless the reason they left their homes in distant Imperial space for 
     the relatively civilized confines of Mora.  There\'s a bit of a 
     dichotomy here that I think makes for fascinating history.  Colonists 
     may well yearn for the wide-open spaces and liberties of the frontier, 
     yet they might also inwardly want to cling to the familiar.  Mora 
     would have likely offered the familiar in that it had cities, 
     skyscrapers, grav vehicles, etc.
     
     >>>Chris:  The colonists have 
     >already done it for me when they calculated the tonnage to move 
     >themselves from their former homes in the established Imperium.
     
     Hans:  Again, I don\'t see why emigrants from, say, Deneb, with their 
     very own colonization ship can be said to come from Mora if all the 
     contact they have with that planet is being gouged a bit on the fuel 
     bill (and believe me, there\'s a very definite limit to how much the 
     Morans _could_ gouge them before someone else started shippin in fuel 
     from Jokotre and under- cutting them).<<
     
     You\'re forgetting one thing that may negate most of this part of the 
     debate:  fuel scoops.
     
     In this age, there is little in the way of enforcement at gas giants 
     in many systems.  Furthermore, Moran officials may have leaned on 
     other governments along the path to Mertactor to allow the colonist 
     flotilla skimming rights.  That cuts a seriously large chunk out of 
     the budget.
     
     >>Chris:  Yes, the numbers are astronomical, but have you ever 
     considered what >it must\'ve cost the Sword Worlders to immigrate from 
     Terra?!  Now that >must\'ve been a pretty penny.  
     
     Hans:  Yes, but that was colonization, not population pressure 
     relief.<<
     
     Different reason.  Same costs.
     
     >Chris:  Expeditions are often undertaken with little consideration 
     for the >financial costs.  
     
     Hans:  Nonsens. Someone will have to foot the bill, and that someone 
     will have to believe it worthwhile.<<
     
     Discussed above.  See my second comment, regarding "setting an 
     example."
     
     >> Chris:  Just ask Kevin Costner.
     
     Hans:  That one went right by me. Didn\'t even see it.<<
     
     This one addresses the recent film, WATERWORLD, starring and partially 
     directed by actor Kevin Costner.  WATERWORLD featured the largest 
     motion picture budget of all time with little chance of delivering a 
     profit.
     
     >>Do you really think any government would be willing to spend that 
     kind of money just to get rid of an insignificant part of their 
     population? I don\'t.<<
     
     Once again, I defer to my second comment, above.
     
     >> The other kind is where you (the government) build a ship, load it 
     with people (volunteers or "volunteers"), send it to some other 
     planet, dump the people, _and comes home for another load to repeat 
     the process_. Now you _may_ be getting into something managable. Now 
     we\'re not just building a ship and waving goodbye to it.<<
     
     It could\'ve been this way.  I left my paper intentionally vague for 
     just this reason.  I write the historical facts.  I leave the 
     logistics to individual referees.
     
     
     >>Dosen\'t quite sound like the free and easy Spinward Marches I\'ve 
     read about, but I can\'t come up with any official statement about it, 
     so I\'ll just say: "Well, maybe."<<
     
     Okay.
     
     >>No, it wouldn\'t. But that little water isn\'t there. 20% of a 
     planet\'s surface is 20%, big or small. Two planets with the same 
     hydrographic percentage is roughly equally lush/arid. (I speak subject 
     to correction by anyone who knows anything about the subject).<<
     
     I don\'t think you\'ll find anyone who\'s travelled to the habitable zone 
     of any other systems besides this one, but I\'ve always been willing to 
     believe that there are probably enough chemical variations in the 
     universe to support some pretty bizarre happenstances.  Like maybe an 
     atmosphere that is slightly rich in carbon dioxide.  Not enough to 
     hurt its status as a type-6 standard atmosphere, but enough to spur a 
     somewhat extraordinary amount of flora.
     
     >>But if so then it\'s an unusual feature of the planet and deserves to 
     be mentioned. (Anyway, you can stuff the soils with chemicals as much 
     as you like; without water it\'s going to be a desert).<<
     
     Once again, I like to leave something to the individual refs out 
     there.  You\'re right, it\'s an important consideration, but in this 
     case, since I neglected to mention it, it\'ll have to fall under the 
     category, "to be determined."  I could mention a lot of things, but I 
     think each individual writer should cover the stuff he thinks is 
     important.
     
     For instance, I use Alvin Plummera\'s Deneb paper for my own campaign 
     background, but I include mention of The Church of the Stellar 
     Divinity, which he neglected to mention.  The Church of the Stellar 
     Divinity was mentioned in MegaTraveller Digest #3 by DGP.  I simply 
     meshed it into the piece Alvin had written.  (As a side note, I also 
     shortened the approval period to get on-planet at Deneb.)
     
     >>It\'s just that I and several others firmly believe that if 
     everything GDW has told us about the basic situation of the Aslans 
     (TL, culture, etc.) and the way shipbuilding economy works is taken

     So in your campaign the ihatei advance never happened?
     
     In any event, I merely mentioned the influence of the aslan because 
     they\'re a local major alien race.  They didn\'t take over Mertactor or 
     Collace or anything!
     
     Since we\'ve broached this tangent, I agree with you.  Especially in 
     light of the rather large separation in weapons advancement between 
     TL-14 and TL-15 lasers that TNE proposes.  Regardless, I believe the 
     aslan would have had a great deal of success conquering low-population 
     worlds and even outer and inner-system worlds of large-pop. high-tech 
     systems.  No one ever said the aslan yearning for land extended only 
     into a system\'s habitable zone!
     
     >>This has been discussed several times before (not heatedly, because

     Who says the aslan took Glisten?  In Alvin\'s Glisten paper, he only 
     said the aslan were present as citizens, not landlords.  They may be 
     traders or mercenaries who immigrated from the worlds the ihatei _did_ 
     take in the Trojan Reaches.
     
     >>Sure. It\'s just that I firmly believe that in an "shared universe"

     I agree completely.  The best thing Traveller has going for it is its 
     rich historical background.  I\'ve been playing the game since 1980 and 
     it reads like a great sci-fi novel.
     
     I only lament that you don\'t feel I\'ve done so.  But then, I have no 
     control over that.  I welcome you to freely edit or completely discard 
     my paper for the purposes of your own campaign.

Specifically, the Serendip Belt, the system the cruiser had jumped to,
had copied the technology and was busily conquering its neighbors. The
scout mission distributed jump drive tech to everyone, restoring a
balance of power.

Steve Higginbotham ran a play-by-email game using the campaign

I don\'t know the crew complements i\'m afraid but here are some simple
dimensions
for a number of TL-8 Wet Navy ships:

Type Name			Length (m)	Displacement (tons)
DDG Arleigh Burke		142			6609
DD Improved Spruance		172			5830
BB Iowa				270			46177
CVN Nimitz			333			81600
FFG O.H. Perry			136			2769
LHA Tarawa			250			25120
CG Ticonderoga VLS		173			7260
FF Type 23 \'Duke\'		133			3500
CVH Invincible			193			16250
DDG Type 42/3 \'Sheffield\'	141			3550
FFL Vosper Mk5			 95			1350

Hope these are of some use to someone.

If a ship is designed in FF&S terms, is there any feature of it that would
make it a destroyer rather than a frigate or visa versa?

The US Navy fields both destroyers and frigates with destroyers having a 
tendancy to possess greater offensive capability and play a variety of roles.
In the Royal Navy, frigates appear to possess more ability than do destroyers.

Is it all something to do with cultural history or is there a naming and
design convention?

> Does anyone know what the definition of a destroyer, and a frigate is?

The modern destroyer can trace it\'s heritage to the HMS Havock (commissioned
in 1893), the first of the Royal Navy\'s new "Torpedo-Boat Destroyers".  This
was a new class of ship specifically designed to protect the fleet against
torpedo boats.  This purpose dictated many of the design elements: high
speed, gun armament as it\'s primary weapon, and torpedo tubes as a secondary
weapon.

As torpedo boats learned to submerge, and eventually became the submarine,
the destroyer became a specialized submarine-hunting warship.  By WWII, the
destroyer\'s duties had expanded to include scouting, attacking, and
providing anti-submarine and anti-aircraft excort for warships and merchant
convoys.

The introduction of new weapon systems for many of the destroyer\'s jobs has
caused modern destroyers to blur the line between a destroyers and the size
and functionality that would traditionally be found in a cruiser.

Going hand-in-hand with these chages are the introduction of a new class,
the destroyer-escort, specifically for the escort of merchant convoys, and
the re-introduction of "frigate" and "corvette" to refer to escort ships
with a primarily anti-submarine role (this new terminology having nothing
at all to do with the use of "frigate" and "corvette" when used to describe
sailing ships).

As with the distinction between destroyers and cruisers, the distinction 
between destroyers and frigates has blurred with the introduction of modern
weapons systems.  In general, a corvette should be the smallest and most
specialized of the three types of vessels (probably specializing in
anti-submarine work), while the destroyer (should be) the largest and 
most multi-purpose of them, but these distinctions are not generally 
observed, even within a single navy.

Designer\'s whim?

In "Classic" Traveller, the frigate class didn\'t exist; escort vessels
smaller than destroyers, particularly those intended for convoy duty, were
designated "destroyer-escorts".  You could, therefore, re-introduce
the term to refer to any sort of ship you think appropriate.

There\'s no convention, so in that sense there\'s no "wrong" way to do it.
If you\'d like your game universe to be a little more consistent, you may
want to invent a convention for your Navy to follow.

At the National Air and Space museum, there\'s an exhibit called "Where Next,
Columbus?" (the whole museum is, of course highly recommended for TML/XBOAT
participatns, BUT:)

A part of this exhibit is the "Stellarium".

It\'s a large cylinder in a darkened room.  Inside the cylinder is an array of
lights (suspended in very tiny, black wires - the wires are practically
invisible).  The lights represent the Sun and all the stars within a 50-ly
radius of Earth.  The scale is 1ly = 25mm, and an attempt has been made to
represent both the brightness and color of all of the stars.  There is a
narration which identifies many of the more familiar stars in the
stellarium (and also points out that, if the brightness of the stars were
truly accurate, many of the dim, red stars would be invisible - and then
switches off those stars).

I\'d love to have this display as a campaign map for 2300, but I don\'t think
it\'s practical.  :-)  If you\'re in the DC area, a side trip to visit this
is probably worthwhile.

     in the right direction.  Below is my interpretation of a Pulse Rifle 
     from the film "Aliens" (I\'m sure a lot of these terms are (c) or TM, 
     but WTF).  Feel free to use, abuse, whatever...
     
     Notes:
     * I started with the ammunition, using the dimensions given, rather 
     than the muzzle energy (probably the wrong way to go, but...).
     * I used Composite Laminate for the receiver and barrel to reduce 
     weight (see TML 181).
     * The cyclic rate should have resulted in a RoF of 10, but that would 
     have required a heavy receiver.  Also, it should have a 4 round burst 
     capability.  I just simplified things and gave a RoF of 5.
     * I added Gyroscopic compensation to reduce recoil.
     
     Comments:
     * Not all that impressive for TL12, but then it\'s meant to simulate 
     something from a film, not be the optimum design.
     * It actually came out pretty close to the dimensions and weight given 
     in the book.
     * I never got round to designing the 30mm canister round for the 
     grenade launcher.

For folks in/visiting Toronto, there is one in the planetarium there as well
(or there was four years ago, when I was there last.)  It does get a highly

Okay, dumb question.  When I\'m designing a laser turret and I want it
to have an MFD, where does the MFD go?  Does it replace the crewstation
that would be in the turret (and thus take up it\'s volume)?  Or, is the
MFD an external piece of machinery from whatever may be inside the
turret (and thus take up volume on the ship, but not in the turret)?

Thanks in advance...

Is it actually one book every six months?  

While Traveller may have good name recognition amongst RPG dealers and
older RPGers, what about the current generation of gamers?  I\'ve been
having a very hard time finding Traveller related products in Nova Scotia. 
While I can undertsand it up here in Cape Breton (Nova Scotia, Canada), I
was surprised that only one gaming store I visited in Halifax (Nova
Scotia) had anything, and that burried in a box with other miscelaneous
RPG books (Arms and Equipment, Striker II).  I did find a lot of White
Wolf/Wizards of the Coast, TSR, Palladium and Star Wars stuff, but
almost nothing of GDW\'s.  Is the situation as bad in other places for 
those interested in Traveller?

I\'d like to try to special order Traveller material, but to do so locally 
I really need the product numbers if I\'m to get these folks to do it.  
Could some kind soul provide me with the product numbers of the TNE 
products to date.  I currently have the basic TNE rules, Path of Tears, 
and Striker II.  I\'m also curious what was in the Deluxe Traveller:TNE 
box set and whether it was worth purchasing.  I\'ve asked GDW for this 
info and/or a catcalog/product list, but they don\'t seem to be answering 
mail these days.  Perhaps they\'re on vacation....

It\'s supposed to be a separate unit, but since it includes a crewstation, I
frequently use one instead of the normal crewstation on the turret.  Also,
because MFDs can control multiple turrets, this might be overly expensive, so
I tend to do it on bigger weapons (bays, for example--or missile barbettes).

So do it either way :)

Just keep in mind whether or not the weapon in question needs a dedicated MFD
enough to justify the added cost.  When in doubt, I add the MFD since a small
added cost is cheaper than losing a ship.

-Merrick

PS-since you\'re designing ships, I\'d add something unrelated:  don\'t bother
putting a damper turret/barbette on anything.  You\'d be much better off with
a 
laser turret (it can shoot at ships *and* missiles, and has a better chance
of
killing the missile anyway--so where are the area dampers, anyway?)

That was true in CT and MT, but AFAIKS it\'s been dropped from TNE. I\'m
currently redesigning a jump-lifeboat that I thought of a while ago, (I\'m
giving it a robot brain this time) - these are the perfect things to carry
around in case you missjump into deep space...

Talking of bizarre vehicles, I thought of a great one in the shower this
morning - grav-boards! Surf-board + contragrav = very silly, but I\'ve just
gotta do it :-) Haven\'t attacked the idea with FF&S yet, but watch this
space...

    'topic' => 'Non-linear PAWs',
    'body' => 'Hi,
 
I\'ve been working on a way to design non-linear PAWs.  The design that follows
was done using some rules I made up with the input (a lot) of Derek Wildstar.
 
Basically, toroidal PAWs run a pulse around the "racetrack" PA a few times 
(call each one a "lap"), then let them go off at a tangent.  This takes more 
energy to do, and as the beam accerates, it becomes harder to keep in the torus,
so the KE imparted to the beam decreases with each lap the beam takes.  
 
As FFS also says, this won\'t take much damage, so I\'d divide the number of hits 
it takes by 3 or 4 (losing one part of the accelerator will cause the beam to 
exit the tunnel right through the wall).  It also uses more juice since each 
shot is made up of several added pulses.
 
Toroidal PAWs:
----
 
1.  Select a tunnel radius, r.
2.  Select a torus radius, R.
3.  Calculate the path length of the torus, L:  L=2*Pi*R
a.  Calculate the DE/lap:  DE/lap=L^2  (this is just the max DE, it 
    could be lower)
4.  Caculate the tunnel volume:  Vtun=2*Pi^2*R*r^2
a.  double this (to cover cradle)
5.  Caculate the effective range as in FFS, but use L from above.
6.  Pick the ROF you want:  ROF(actual)=(ROFeff)/laps per shot.
7.  Calculate the effective ROF (this is just the total laps used each turn).
8.  Calculate the actual DE:  DE=DE/lap*sqrt(laps per shot)
9.  IE=10*DE/lap (use this for HPG calculations)
10. For power, use the ROFeff, as the ROF.
 
All the other stuff uses the regular rules.  The idea here is that you take an 
HPG that  will support a ROF=800, and use several "shots" per actual shot 
(since the beam doesn\'t leave the tunnel).
 
The following is a sample TL15 Ring PAW.  It used the above stuff, but I added 
a short, linear section on the end.  This critter *includes* its own powerplant (there was extra room).
 
==================================================================
TL15 Ring PAW (two tunnels----both must fire at the same target)
 
Displacement:	65 tons (it fits in a standard 50ton bay, but has a 15ton turret
		above decks)

Bore Diam:		2m
Mass:			857.89 tonnes
Price:			76.72 MCr
Crew:			1
 
This weapon has a variable ROF, and the DE changes with the ROF.  
 
ROF	DE (MJ)	Power	 (MW)			Stats
(act)	(per tube)	(total used)		(BL over BR)
----
10	1937.26		1435.82		10:220   20:110   40:55   80:28
					P10:6-3-2-1
 
50	1243.24		"	"	10:176   20:88    40:44   80:22
					P(-1)10:5-3-2-1
 
100	893.46		"	"	10:150   20:75   40:37   80:19
					P(-2)10:4-2-1-0
 
200	646.12		"	"	10:127   20:64   40:32   80:16
					P(-3)10:4-2-1-0
 
 
The ROF of 10 is for each tunnel, so you\'ll get 2 shots.  All the other ROFs 
assume 2 tubes firing, so the ROF of 50 has each tunnel firing 25 shots where 
each shot took 16 laps around the PA.  Because they share an HPG, they\'d 
alternate actually firing.  There is enough waste space to armor the turret up 
to around BR AV:15 or so if you were worrying about it (still weak, but what the
hell :).
 
This bay looks like a 2 barrel large naval gun, but the barrels are much bigger in relation to their length.

     As far as I can see in FF&S, there is no weight modifier for caseless

     lighter (and you can get more in a magazine because it tends to be 
     square in cross section) than comparable cased ammo.
     
     *Is this true?

Cost?  Cost?  Did you say cost?  Not to worry, military-surplussed

Not a bad idea.  Hmm.  Makes me think about non-grav focused lasers as
well.  Sure, they really suck at long and extreme ranges, but at short
and medium, a TL-15 720Mj laser turret does double the damage and
penetration, and has about the same power requirements as a 150Mj grav
focused laser turret.  Makes you wonder about MFD\'ing a couple of
turrets and then switching between the two based on range of target...

*>BEGIN TRANSMISSION<*

Greetings fellow TMLers! Commander X has returned from his long foray within
the Vargr Extents
and is ready to begin the 2nd instalment of Tales from the Line, but 1st,
the old Commander must
put in his 2 credits worth...

quoting from Mr. Boulton in Digest#385 (aboulton@cix.compulink.co.uk):

I have been using these toys since MT days, but I converted them to TNE.
The original idea was to try to make a Hoverboard like from "Back to the
Future part II" but all I
could do was make a hover surfboard.(The things heavy too! 86kg  :(  ) The
stats are as follows...

Hoverboard TL-12

HULL:
	Rate:0.005	Volume:0.07m^3	Material Vol:0.003m^3
	Config:simple(slab)	SA:70cm^2`	Mass:0.003
	Material:fiberglass	hull cost:3cr

SUSPENSION:
=09
	HiEff ContraGrav TL-12 	Vol:0.03	Mass:0.02
				Power:0.01MW	Cost:3000cr

POWER:
=09
	0.01MW Storage Battery TL-11
	Duration: 1hour
	0.01m^3 	0.02tonnes 	Cost:40cr

Total Price: 3043cr
Total Mass:0.043tonnes(86kg<heavy!>)
Total Space Available:0.07m^3	Total space used:0.043	Waste space:0.027m^3

Dimensions:  1m x 70cm x 10cm (1x0.7x0.1=3D.007  OK! :) )

To use the hoverboard,  jump on it, put your foot on the pressure activator
and it will gently rise as
the mass becomes boyant.  Then just push of the ground with the other foot
and coast!  Simple!
But bear in mind the laws of Newtonian mechanics, the harder you push, the
faster It goes and
the more you push, the more you excellerate.  To slow down you must either
coast or use your off
foot to brake.=7F

My PC\'s had loads of fun with these toys, crashing into walls and each other
(giggle!) Hoverboard
tasks are realtively easy to judge, just use the AGL stats (yes Accrobatics
can help too!) and
depending how fast they go and how fancy they do it, raise the dificulty
appropriately.

I hope that gives you some ideas Mr. Boulton.  Now that you have this, you
dont need to do all
those calcultions in FF&S! Please feel free to correct, adjust,
improve(especialy the MASS!) or
whatever.

No, I sometimes use an MFD *instead* of the wkstation.

I\'ve just tried designing some starships at TL9, I haven\'t finished the designs 
yet, but lots of interesting things turned up while I was working on it.

- There is an error in the MFD chart, which includes TL9 MFDs with ranges up to 
10 hexes. All very well, but they need a pencil beam active sensor, and TL 9 
radar has a maximum short range of 3 hexes. This means that there is no point in 
fitting a (3hex) MFD, as a 10 hex beam-pointer would be far more effective at 
most ranges.
I would suggest the following chart as a quick fix for this

Radar availability
                        Processor Volume
Short range (km)         TL8    TL9
90,000                   60     30
120,000                  70     35
150,000                  85     45
180,000                  100    52
210,000                  -      57
240,000                  -      62
270,000                  -      75
300,000                  -      85


- It is very hard to design any kind of exploration craft, even once Jump-1 
becomes available at TL9. For proper exploration, refuelling capability is 
important. Fusion rockets are very effective drives, so long as you don\'t want 
to get anywhere fast, but they \'cannot be used in planetary atmospheres\'. I 
assume this is mainly because of the effects of radiation on planetary 
ecologies, so this doesn\'t apply entirely to gas giants. However, flying a 
fusion rocket powered craft through a gas giant creates another problem, as the 
plasma exhaust will cause secondary fusion reactions in the hydrogen behind the 
craft. This means that any refuelling craft needs to keep up speed inside the 
gas giant so the fusion explosion behind it doesn\'t catch up. In design terms 
this requires an airframe hull and armouring to 30 to prevent the fuel shuttle 
from burning up, and to allow it to go fast enough in the atmosphere, although 
1G acceleration should be sufficient to allow escape.
:From orbit the sight of fuel shuttles refuelling is truly impressive. On 
entering the atmosphere an initial fireball speads out slowly from the point of 
impact with the atmosphere. From one edge of the expanding fireball a point of 
fire reaches out, an inferno spreading out like the wake of a speedboat from the 
speeding shuttle.
Even with a specifically designed craft the danger of this maneouvre is 
considerable. Refuelling in this way is a Difficult:Pilot Interface/Grav task. 
Failure results in 1h damage to the fuel shuttle, and -1 to the physical 
attributes of the crew for the next week due to slight radiation poisoning (The 
only symptom unless the referee is cruel/realistic. ADVENTURE idea: Optionally 
some or all of the crew develop cancers which may not be treatable at TL9, 
turning their exploration mission into a race against time to find some 
civilisation advanced enough to treat their sickness.)
Catastrophic failure results in the destruction of the craft (crewmembers could 
escape in a specially designed rocket escape pod, but they would definitely 
receive major radiation poisoning)
Low tech pilots tend to be _very_ good for this reason.

-Exploration is also hampered by the available thrusters. All of the lower tech 
thrusters have very large fuel requirements, and cannot be fueled on hydrogen. 
The low thrust of the \'clean\' thrusters means that the main exploration vessel 
cannot land on habitable planets using them, so much smaller landers, launched 
from a jump capable fusion rocket propelled craft would need to be used. Because 
none of the clean thrusters can be fuelled with hydrogen, the mothership would 
need to carry enough fuel for the whole mission.

I suggest the following thruster as a TL9 solution for planetary landings

TL Type             Th   MCr    MaxT    FC     FT     Airframe
9  HeatJet          8    0.5    -       2.00   Lhyd   Hyper

The heat jet passes liquid hydrogen around a fusion reactor, heating it and 
boiling it, expelling it as a gas. This is a precursor to the HEPlaR drive, but 
the hydrogen does not reach a plasma state. Although considerably inferior to 
the fusion rocket which becomes available at the same time, it is a cleaner 
alternative, and can be used within planetary atmospheres.
Alternatively stick with the FFS rules, it produces interesting results and 
makes design challenging, if not impossible.

Adventure idea:
Under normal conditions the fusion wake in gas giant atmospheres will die down, 
as the atmosphere is not dense enough to support the fusion reaction. However, a 
brown dwarf, a gas giant which is almost a star, could possibly be triggered by 
a fusion rocket into igniting into a full star, making the vicinity decidedly 
uncomfortable for any lifeforms.
This could cause all sorts of problems for the players:
1. Get out of here! Now! - The players\' ship should be capable of taking them 
out of danger, of course now would be a particularly unfortunate time for 
saboteurs/vermin/old age to strike at the maneuver drive, resulting in a race to 
repair it before the the characters become Kentucky Fried Travellers.  
Alternatively, insufficient fuel to escape had been taken from the star, so the 
fuel shuttles are forced to make a few last runs into an igniting star to get 
enough fuel to escape

2. Guilt trips - Even if the players can get away, it doesn\'t meant that 
everyone else nearby can. If the players\' actions have accidentally caused the 
impending doom of someone nearby, then they should probably have a go at 
rescuing the victims, who could be:
1/A settlement on a nearby agricultural moon.
2/Sentient aliens encountered living within the atmosphere of the gas giant.
3/A nearby free trader who is experiencing problems similar to those outlined 
above for the players.
4/An old imperial research station, complete with signal beacon and remnants in 
low berths. 
5/For mercenary players, a cache of relic technology could be discovered on 
one of the moons just as the gas giant ignites - how much can they grab before 
the lot goes up in flames?

I don\'t know, but there are a few theoretical near-future (or possible, but not 
attempted) drive types which are not mentioned in FFS
Orion Drive: A bit like the Daedalus drive mentioned in FFS, but intended for 
insystem maneuvers. Nuclear warheads would be dropped and detonated behind the 
craft, the explosion pushing on a shock absorbing \'pusher plate\'and driving the 
craft forward. This system would produce massive thrust, and would be available 
at TL8-9. While it wouldn\'t be as bad as a fusion rocket, it would have a 
detrimental effect on the ecology of a planet if used in a major space program.

Nuclear-thermal rocket: Water or some other reaction mass would be heated by a 
nuclear reactor (fission/fusion) and the steam resulting would be vented at the 
rear to produce thrust.

The thrust of both of these would be comparable to or greater than the low tech 
thrusters presented in FFS, and the fuel economy would be an order of magnitude 
greater.

The flame would be very hot, but when travelling at a speed of 67 km/s (4hexes 
per turn) or a similar order of magnitude, the reaction mass expended would be 
spread out across such a large area that it would not be easily visible. The 
exhaust near the ship would be hotter, but the greatest signiture would come 
from the end of the ship heating up, which would accumulate heat, rather than 
the exhaust itself.

               And second, would using a fusion drive in the region from the 
> upper atmosphere to LEO  generate an EMP?
HEPlaR is not radioactive, so it wouldn\'t. Fusion rockets would certainly emit a 
lot of electromagnetic radiation, but it probably wouldn\'t be an EMP. The energy 
from the fusion rocket is output more gradually than from a nuclear explosion, 
so there would be a constant wash of radiation rather than a pulse. This 
radiation might be enough to disrupt electronics depending on the size of the 
rocket and the range involved.

Bear in mind that these limitations only apply if you are designing turrets to 
be fitted to traders and similar ships which otherwise have no MFDs. You could 
design a turret with no MFD or crewstation, but it could only be used by ships 
with fitted MFDs as part of their original design (inevitably, any ship with 
unused hardpoints is unlikely to have an MFD). Think of MFDs as remote controls 
for ships\' weapons, they are usually in a completely different part of the ship. 
A turret can work without MFD/crewstation, but if there is neither a crewstation 
or an MFD in the turret, it means that if the external MFDs are blown up, then 
the turret cannot be fired.

The reduced crew requirement when using MFD batteries can help with particularly 
tight designs, but remember, there is no need to stick to the standard volumes 
for turrets and barbettes in your own designs. You do more work if you work with 
non-standard sizes, but once you get used to designing lasers in FFS, you can 
produce custom designs pretty quickly.

Actually, you can\'t \'enforce\' the official rules, either.  Back when I was
running the MegaTraveller Referees\' Exchange, a lot of people sent me designs
using their favourite varient rules, without a note stating that these were
varients.  (Most of these changes made weaponry more deadly.)   

Some of the designs in this list have done the same thing.

It\'s easy to see if a design follows the TL*50 rule.  If a ship breaks that
rule, you can always decide that in your universe that ship doesn\'t exist.

If you are interested in Mac Traveller program then: I started writing a

The lastest version I posted anywhere did a pretty good job of mapping
space (sort of a traders\' view of space, including most of the little
symbols GDW includes in their maps, move around by clicking on another system).
It also included a word generation & speaking package and a simple dice
rolling package.

The mapping sub-program did include generation of worlds, reading in
the standard sector files and seaching for worlds based on stats, names etc
Plus any die roll could optionally be edited for GMs customisation.


It is located at: ghost.cc.missouri.edu (128.206.222.222)
and the file is:  PUB/Traveller/software/TNEUtil.sea

It is a self extracting archive, though Stuffit Expander should be able
to deal with it.

Howdy,

I\'ve been thinking about the way damage is handled in BR, and it seems a little
screwy.  The fact that you add outstanding hits together is what bugs me.

A while back there was a "death of BRs" thread, and part ot it (in addition to
cheap/low_volume armor at large ship sizes) was the fact that you need a big
ship to have a big MG (unlike HG where the biggest MG was 7000tons).  The reason
for the death of the BR in BR (but *not* in BL!) is the conversion they did 
from BL to BR, *not* the TNE universe as it stands.

Meson screens in BR subtract their PV from the attack *even if the task fails*,
this is not the case in BL.  So instead of making them work like BL, they added
the Outstanding Success = 2*damage rule so MGs would have some value (my theory)
As it stands, MSs are very, very effective.  As a result, Outstanding success
is virtually required to do damage.  In addition, none of the ships given in BR
are well designed. With a MS:16 ship that is size -4, it is totally safe from
MGs that do less than damage 10, and only temps from them (all on outstanding
success only), and that is assuming they miss their 75% chance of no damage at
all.

If you play meson screens as they are in BL (base diff 3, +1 if the MG exceeds
the MS by 2 or more, and +2 if 4 or more, and -1 if the MS beats the MG by 4+),
a successful task negates the attack, and if it fails the ship takes MG + size
damage.  Don\'t double damage (out. suc. equals 2 separate hits).  Remember that
you\'ll have to compare the BL values for the MG and MS (use the chart at the
end of the BR rules) since the BR damage values scale to BL in a non-linear way.

The gist of this is that MGs are as useful as they are in BL.  A smaller ship,
with a smaller MG has a small (5% if MG*4<MS) chance of doing damage, but if it
does, it will do its full damage (minus size).  Now, like BL, many smaller ships
have a use against one bigger one.

To use the example of the damage=10 MG vs. MS:16, if the MG hits (95% at short
range) the screen task will be 1.  95% of the time no damage (100% the old way).If the task fails, then it\'ll take 6 hits (10+(-4)).  On outstanding success, 
the BR way does 1 temp hit every time.  The BL way it would do no damage 67%
of the time, but you\'d get 2 trys.  If it does hit, it\'ll do 6 hits.

The cool thing is lesser MGs will have the same 33% chance to do some damage.

Good point. I recall a sequence in Larry Niven\'s World of Ptaavs which

Any real numbers for this ? How many candlepower to the megawatt of drive

    'body' => 'In digest 379-381, there has been some discussion on the Mertactor RICE
Paper presented by Christopher Griffen. I would like to add to this
with the points below.

1. Cost of Transportation

Transporting people is always costly. However, it is often done with
more than one agenda in mind. The transportation of British convicts to
Australia had two main purposes: it rid Britain of "criminals" (no matter
that they might only have stolen a loaf of bread to feed their family)
but also allowed Britain to claim Australia as a colony. The original
convicts, by creating some basic infrastructure, paved the way for later
colonists to move to Australia.

Perhaps the Moran initiative could be seen in the same way, killing two
birds with one stone. It allowed Mora to establish a distant Imperial
presence, a base from which to expand/refuel/explore etc. The cost of
transporting people could be seen to be recouped in other ways.

2. Re: Cost-benefits

>>Just ask Kevin Costner.
>That one went right by me. Didn\'t even see it.

A Waterworld reference?

3. Re: "free and easy Spinward Marches"

I believe that the original reference to the Marches went something like
this:
        "We\'ll be working in the lunatic fringe... I mean, Imperial Rim".
(Book 0: Intro to Traveller)

If you look at the Marches ITO the Imperial Core, the ENTIRE area would
be seen to be "the wilds" ("here be dragons", etc). Being posted to the
Marches back in the 300-500\'s could be likened to being posted by an
imperial power to an African colony last century. I have never thought of
the Marches as "free and easy", unless this means "you can do what you want
and it is too far away for anyone to care". The latter applies to
governments just as much as individuals.

4. Aslan ihatei

I must admit that I agree here. I have never believed that the Aslan could
ever get as far as Glisten. OK, the Imperium would probably lose its
toe-hold in Pax Rulin and so on (how embarrassing, I have forgotten the
sector name!), especially given the poor admiral as noted by DGP. But
Glisten? It is a major naval base, shipyard, etc. as well as being
Hi Pop - plenty of defenders, all at TL 15. Oh well, we shall see.

5. The purpose of RICE Papers

I believe that the purpose of posting ANYTHING to this list can be
split into the following major categories:

        a. Asking for help OR for replies to specific questions;
        b. Sharing useful information/designs/rules with others
           on the list;
        c. Posting ideas so that the list can be used as a "sounding-
           board" to test theories/speculations etc., especially before
           publishing them.

For my money, the RICE Papers fall into category (c) above. They are
posted to INVITE comment and constructive criticism. I believe that
anyone who posts to this list would be open to receive genuine,
positive critiques of their work.

.. And apart from Olga, these are the only type of responses I have
seen. We are all fanatical about Traveller (or we wouldn\'t subscribe to
this list), and I believe all of us want to see well-presented, positive,
believable [and _canonical_ ;-)] products produced to enhance the game.

Thanks to everyone that had some input as to my question about lasers
and workstations.  Checking over the crew part of the laser design
sequence, it does say that a laser may be ``uncrewed\'\' if it is tied
into an external MFD.  So, my own question answered in print.  Maybe
next time I should try reading the book!  8)

Anyway, here are two laser sequences that I came up with.  Could
another laser guru out there check them out and tell me if they\'re
correct.

TL-15 200Mj Tunable Laser Turret
Vol: 42kl    Mass: 75    MW: 5.6    MCr: 1.05
Short: 10:1/14-35    Med: 20:1/14-35    Long: 40:1/14-35    Ext: 80:1/14-35

Design Notes:
    FA=3.6    IE=1000    F=4666    R=156

TL-15 750Mj Non-Gravitic Focusing X-Ray Laser Turret
Vol: 42kl    Mass: 61.74    MW: 4.9    MCr: 1.01
Short: 10:1/22-68    Med: 20:1/13-41    Long: 40:1/7-21    Ext: 80:1/3-10

Design Notes:
    FA=3.6    IE=882    F=3.6    R=12

So, assuming that my designs are correct, which is the better laser to
use?  They both will need an external MFD (and are thus uncrewed).  But
I was wondering, what is the range that most effective ship combat
takes place.  In my opinion, the x-ray laser would be better,
especially for merchants because they could really screw up the day of
a corsair that gets too close (think of this turret as a nasty
suprise).  However, this is only as long as the starship combat takes
place at short and medium ranges.

Now, since I\'m not the BL expert, I was wondering how accurate and
effective is combat at long and extreme ranges.  Whenever I\'ve played,
it wasn\'t until medium range that players even started to hit with some
regularity, but that may just be us.

Any opinions (Chris, Andrew, Merrick, et al) flames or just questions?

Thanks in advance...

had arrived.  I was very impressed with this issue; it seemed thicker, and 
was chock-full of Traveller, 2300AD and TW2000 goodies.  

In the Traveller area, there was a fairly good adventure, a corporate female 
NPC, and Mark Gelinas\' notes on collapsing pre-Virus UPPs.  The adventure 
was fairly good, but has one of the WORST damned drawings I\'ve ever seen in 
Challenge.  There was also an expansion of the Technical Database info for 
the Intrepid/Trepida Grav Tank (nice details on variants), Commodore Bwana, 
and a very long rebuttal/reply/rant from Dave Nilsen regarding all of the 
negative reaction to Hivers & Ithlkur.  Well, it starts that way, but 
quickly develops into a defense of the Virus, the Collapse and TNE in general.

I was not all that disappointed with H&I, but it is defintely my least 
favorite "Aliens" sourcebook from either GDW or DGP.  Dave seemed to be 
trying to address the folks that are really ticked over the whole Traveller 
direction, rather than the mildly annoyed people like myself.  He makes some 
pretty good points about focus and detail levels, but his editorial sort of 
falls apart in confusion.  Its apparent to me that Dave defintely gives a 
damn about what he does and what he writes, and wants people to understand 
that he and GDW are not just trying to randomly piss people off.  For what 
its worth Dave, I\'m still on the GDW Traveller bandwagon, and I think lots 
of other people are too.

Some interesting advertisement oddities:  A full-page add from RAFM with a 
bunch of new Traveller starships, including several Regency designs.   An 
add for the Regency Sourcebook (August release, drool, drool), an add for 
The Guilded Lilly (the first Virus Redux adventure, also listed for August), 
and a couple of TW2000 items; The Vistual Epic and Armor 21 (now scheduled 
for October).

Definitely one of the better issues from the past couple of years.

The xray will critical a small ship at short range.  This is a _good thing_(tm).
Other than that, I like the tunable one better in the 20-40 range which is where
your first chance to hit a small ship will be (and lasers like this won\'t do too
much to a bigger ship).  This means the other guy can pick the range.  I\'d put
one of each on the trader :)  Just shoot the tunable until he gets a god shot 
off, then stop shooting it to spoof him in, then critical him... unless you can
get close without getting shot first.  I\'d go for high ROF in either case.  I
don\'t make weapons at less than max ROF unless they\'re for anti-missile use or
the like.

Now for a Zhodani laser.

Zho TL14 200Mj Tunable/xray Laser Turret
Vol: 56kl	Mass: 86.22	MW: 5.56 (ROF=10)	MCr: 1.404

This turret has one HPG and *two* focal arrays.  One is an xray laser for space
use, the other is tunable.  Both are beefed up for a ROF of 800, all you have
to add is the juice.

xray:  		10:1/11-35 (same at all ranges)
BR stats:	L[-5]10:1 ([] indicate beefed, but not powered)

Tunable:	4:1/11-35	8:1/7-21	16:1/3-11	32:1/2-5
BR stats:	L[-5]4:1-1-0-0

Design notes:  The Zhodani standardized on a larger turret size than the 
Imperium due to their technological lag.  Combat experience had shown them the 
need for their smaller ships to be able to strike at ranges of light-seconds
----otherwise their Imperial counterparts would choose the range and kill them.

The choice of 2 focal arrays allows a flexibility of operations desirable in
small ships which are more likely to find themselves in an atmosphere.

	Caseless ammunition design in FFS

	In page 92 FFS states that "all non-ETC cartridges at TL 9+ are
	caseless". However, there is no design rules for caseless ammunition.

	Caseless cartridges have a block of solid propellant instead of metal
	shell casing and loose propellant. Because of this, caseless ammo
	is lighter and has more propellant than cased ammo with same external
	dimensions.
	Reliable caseless ammo becomes available at TL 8. Note that weapons
	that are designed to use cased ammo can not use caseless ammo even
	if both ammo types were externally identical. In normal firearms the
	shell casing forms a gas seal at the breech end of the barrel, and
	a caseless round may cause a gas leak. (The same situation may happen
	if an worn-out shell is reloaded, and the shell ruptures when fired.)


	Straight caseless ammo have a block of propellant fixed to the base
	of large bullet. (Example: .22 Daisy V/L)

	Necked caseless ammo have a small bullet fixed to the end of larger
	block of propellant. The propellant block has a hollow core, with
	bullet in one end and the primer in the other end.
	(Example: .223 Usel)

	Telescoped ammo is similar to necked ammo, but the bullet is placed
	inside the hollow propellant core, next to the primer. The explosion
	of primer pushes the bullet away from the core. (Example 4.93x33 H&K)


	FFS: Ammunition Design additions

	Length formula:		Used for:
	Lasg = Lcc		Shotgun ammunition
	Las = Lcc + d		Straight cased or caseless ammunition
	Lan = Lcc + 2d		Necked cased or caseless ammunition
	Lat = Lcc		Telescoped caseless ammunition

	(Example: 4.93x33 telescoped ammunition is 33mm long)


	Weight of ammo: caseless ammo is lighter than corresponding cased
	ammo. This table shows Ammunition Weight Multipliers for caseless
	ammunition.

	Ammo Type		Awm
	Shotgun shell		0.003
	Straight caseless	0.007
	Necked caseless		0.008	(also telescoped caseless)
	Straight		0.008
	Necked			0.010

	(Example: 4.93x33 telescoped caseless weighs 5 grams)


	Average Muzzle Energy: caseless ammunition has more propellant than
	corresponding cased ammunition. This table shows Cartridge modifiers
	for caseless ammunition.

	Cartridge Type		Cm
	Shotgun			0.2
	Shotgun ETC		0.3
	Straight		0.4
	Straight Caseless	0.5
	Straight ETC		0.8
	Necked			1.6
	Necked Caseless		2.0	(also telescoped caseless)
	Necked ETC		3.2

	(Example: TL-8 4.93x33 Telescoped caseless has 1386 joules Average
	Muzzle Energy)


	Reality Check: Modern 4.93x33 H&K round weighs 5.2 grams, and
	the 3.3 gram bullet is fired at a muzzle velocity of 930 m/s.
	The Muzzle Energy is 1427 joules.

	According to FFS, the Average Barrel Length for 1386j, 4.93mm
	bullet is 57cm. If the barrel length is increased to 61.94cm,
	the Actual Muzzle Energy is 1427j.

	----

	Note that necked or telescoped caseless ammo may have square
	cross section. This means that there is less packing losses
	(empty volume between ammo) when square ammo is stacked into
	a magazine. In FFS terms this is significant only with pistol
	grip magazines.
	Medium-sized grip magazine has the volume of 60 cm3, and magazine
	with cylinderical ammo has twice the volume of carried ammo.
	If magazine is filled with compacts square ammo, the total volume
	of magazine is 1.5 times the volume of carried ammo.

>    Also, what material is the magazine assumed to be made of?  Steel (in 
>    which case I could replace it with composite)?

	I think that the FFS magazines are made of Hard Steel, and it
	should be possible to use other materials.
	The magazines used in new Kalashnicov, Sako, Sig and Steyer rifles
	can be considered to be made of composite materials.

I don\'t believe there\'s any likelihood it would do that... Atoms are not 
naturally fusionable, they have to be "persuaded" by unusual conditions - they 
do not "burn" with a fusion reaction like they burn chemically. The opposing 
positive charges on hydrogen nucleii (and other nucleii) provide a very high 
repulsion as the nucleii approach - they have to start out clsoe and fast to 
overcome that and get close enough for the nucleic fields (strong force) to 
overlap and allow the nucleii to fuse.

There are two ways to trigger fusion:

1) *very* high temperatures, moderate-to-high pressure, and confinement, as 
naturally found inside a star, and as forced inside a hot-fusion reactor (by 
pumping lasers and confining mag-fields)
2) <SF> use <strong-force> field manipulators (reverse dampers) or whatever, to 
catalyze the reaction.

RE 1): The exhaust of even a fusion drive is bulked up by extra gas, heated by 
the reactor core, so as to generate extra thrust - that plus the expansion as it 
leaves the confines of the drive, plus the radiative loss from glowing bright, 
all mean that the drive plasma is going to cool down rapidly (to white hot or 
so) and no longer fuse,
(the confinement requirement for reactors is so that the gas doesn\'t escape and 
expand (cool down) before it has time to fuse)

RE 2) only works inside the catalytic field of the reversed dampers, and has no 
effect in the world outside.

If there were oxidant in the gas-giant atmosphere, there\'d be a flame (chemical) 
reaction triggered by the heat of the tail, but any oxidants would have been 
rapidly soaked up by the vast sea of reducing gasses long before the ship got

even without adding fusion, this is true!  In order to boost out again from the 
gravity well, refueling botas seem to make parabolic dives at high speed, and, 
yes, the fusion trail will be incandescent and will form a fireball in dense 
gas, just from the heat alone.
The fireball of nukes etc are not <burning> its just the effect of dumping 
unreasonable amounts of heat into a volume of gas! 

As far as display from a distance, remember that gas giants are *huge* - the 
cloud spots seen from earth, when the comet hit jupiter, were "the size of the 
planet earth", and triggered by impacts equivalent to several Million Megatons! 
The starship fireball may look huge from the ship, and be thousands of miles 
long, but will be very thin  relative to its length.  From outside the gas 
gaint, looking at the whole planet, it\'ll be no more than a hair thin bright 
line flashing across the planet and extinguishing behind itself.

this is almost how the fusion drive works anyway. I think the Trav version has 
the Lhyd dumped into the fusion core; but all realistic proposals (eg from NASA) 
have in fact used your plasma drive, fueled by the reactor heat.

still doesn\'t work under Physics - the reason the brown dwarf doesn\'t turn into 
a star on its own is nothing to do with conditions in the thin upper atmosphere 
(0-10 Atms) that a spaceship might plummet through, but to the conditions 
thousands of miles deeper down, in the core of the gas giant, in the metallic 
hydrogen layers.   In the gas giant the heat and pressure are *very* high, but 
not high enough to start a fusion reaction -- in a star, the core does fuse ( 
and sufficient extra matter falls onto the star to ensure it stays compressed 
and doesn\'t heat up and blow away its outer layers and stop  fusing after the 
initial burst.)

this is a good one, and has been seen before.  Remember that the hypersonic 
flight of the shuttle plus the blast of the expanding (and collpsing) firetrail 
will cause a broad swathe of devastation in the upper atmosphere.

This is something which has bothered me about TNE for some time. Any
ship with an operating fusion drive will create a clearly defined
\'drive plume\' visible across a wide spectrum (soft X-ray to radio) and
likely to be tens of thousands of km long. In effect: I\'m here ----
shoot me! :)

To achieve the kinds of specific impulse described for TNE
drives, the reaction mass emitted by the ship would have to be
travelling "backwards" at a healthy fraction of the speed of light. If
it was otherwise unconfined, the plasma trail would expand "sideways"
at its internal sound speed, which would be considerably less than the
exhaust velocity...giving a narrow "drive plume". Magnetic effects may
make the plume even narrower (an effect called "flux-freezing" would
drag magnetic field from the drive\'s magnetic confinement \'bottle\' out
into the plume and wrap the field around it).

If I was looking for a fusion drive plume, I\'d look at UV wavelengths
(free-free emission from the ultra-hot plasma), optical (line emission
from recombining hydrogen and helium), and radio (synchrotron emission
from charged particles in the magnetic fields of the plume). Radio
interferometry especially would be able to pinpoint the ship very
nicely (fractional-arcsecond accuracy) :)

I\'d have to do some guesstimating, but I reckon that high-tech
passive EMS sensors could _image_ (not just detect) a drive plume as
far out as the orbit of Jupiter.

*Blink*...so far as I\'m aware, radioactivity isn\'t a prerequisite for
an EMP. An EMP as I understand it arises from a large mass of ionised
material moving very rapidly (moving charges radiate EM radiation). If
the HEPlaR produces an ionised exhaust, then it should produce
EMP-like effects (but probably only a fairly weak, continuous effect,
as stated above). More dangerous would be flying _through_ the magnetic
"drive plume" of another ship...if you were moving quickly enough that
could well blow all your electronics :-)

NetRPG - RolePlaying over the Internet
C1995 by Erich G Bratton erich@kagi.com

"Did you used to play Role Playing Games in the old days, but can\'t
anymore because your fellow gamers have moved off to jobs or grad schools
in other cities?  Well, you\'re in luck!  You can still play RPG\'s (like
D&D, copyright by TSR) with NetRPG!"

NetRPG is an expansion on Chat 2.0.6, with many added features that make
it suitable for playing RPG\'s over the internet.

Version 2.4 adds buffered TCP connections for (hopefully!) better speed
and reliability, along with numerous other improvements which are listed
in the What\'s New file included with this package.

Thanks!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:     
BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT NET-RPG

Table of contents for this page:
0) Who wrote NetRPG?

2) What machines does NetRPG run on?
3) Does it cost anything?
4) What do you really do with it?

0) Who wrote NetRPG?
    NetRPG was written by me, Erich G Bratton (erich@kagi.com), in order
    to keep playing games once everyone I gamed with in college moved
    on to other cities.
    
1) What is NetRPG?
    NetRPG is an internet server which lets a group of friends role-play
    over the net.  NetRPG allows players to talk with one another using a
    mud-like interface, ready weapons, set an armor class, have hit
    points, store online character sheets, calculate and run combats
    using initiative rolls, resolve attacks and distribute damage between
    players and monsters, store and retrieve ASCII maps to facilitate
    showing exactly where the action is occuring, roll dice either in the
    open or privately shown to only the player and DM, and allows the
    DM to fudge attack rolls when a plot line necessitates a critical hit
    or miss or whatever.

    All of these features combine in NetRPG to make live internet
    role-playing not only possible, but very enjoyable!

2) What machines does NetRPG run on?
    The NetRPG server runs on any Macintosh which has MacTCP.  Once the
    server is running, the players can connect to the server using their
    favorite MUD client from any type of machine.  (ie, they could run
    tinyfugue on a unix box, or Muddweller on a mac, or a telnet program
    on a PC)
    NOTE: a unix/DOS version is currently being worked on by another
programmer...
    
    So, as long as you have one person who has a mac someplace, you can
    play using NetRPG.  You don\'t even have to be sitting at the Mac to
    play, you can just leave NetRPG running on a mac in an office
    someplace.
    
3) Does it cost anything?
    NetRPG is free.  All I ask is that you send me email telling me what
    you\'re doing with it, and whether or not you like it. 
    (erich@kagi.com)
    
4) What do you really do with it?
    Well, once you have played for a while and start getting into more
    complex adventures, you can add on Maven or other audio-conferencing
    tools (assuming everyone has a fast connection) or an electronic
    whiteboarding program such as "wb" for XWindows or NCSA\'s Collage. 
But, now that NetRPG supports movable icons on the maps, you can get some
serious gaming done with just text connections!
    
5) How do I find someone to play games with?
    The difficulty with NetRPG is that you never see/hear the other
    people.  For this reason, it seems to help to know the people you are
    playing with. However, if you don\'t have anyone who\'d like to play,
    I think that advertising on rec.games.frp.dnd for a group to play
    on a regular basis (once a week works for my group) should turn up
    more than a few responses.

6) Where do I get a copy of NetRPG?
    NetRPG is available on the info-mac and umich archives.  Either pick
    your favorite archive and go into the comm/tcp directory, or use
    the following URL:
    
    ftp://mirror.aol.com/pub/info-mac/comm/tcp/
    
    Look for net-rpg-#.hqx, where # is the version number.  If you don\'t
    understand how FTP works, or how to unpack a file, please try to
    have someone around you help you out.  If not, email me and I\'ll
    help you.

HA281PMR01@ntu.ac.uk (Lynx) [Paul Radford] asked:

> Does anyone know what the definition of a destroyer, and a frigate is?

I went home last night and looked it up in volume 1 of the Admiralty Manual 
of Seamanship a Destroyer is a large multi-purpose ship with the ability to 
fight air, surface and subsurface threats equally well. A frigate is a 
smaller ship designed with one primary role (anti-air, anti-surface, or 
anti-subsurface) and a much reduced ability to perform in another role.

Also, Destroyers tend to have extra command and control facilities allowing 
them to be used as flagships (HMS Glamorgan was used as the flagship of the 
Falklands task force until the carriers arrived in the South Atlantic).

See above.

The Admiralty Manual of Seamanship comes in three volumes and covers all 
aspects of living and working aboard ship. Over the years I have found it 
invaluable for ship-based Traveller campaigns.
I don\'t know of an American equivalent, although I\'m sure there must be one. 
The Admiralty Manual of Seamanship is available in the UK through the HMSO 
and HMSO-approved booksellers. I don\'t have current prices.

Kind Regards

Well, as one of the premiere GDW blasters (TM), I thought that I\'d
actually take this chance to defend them.

I\'m not disappointed with the GDW material per se.  Everyone can harp
about a spelling error or two, but it\'s not worth the worry.  I commend
GDW on the fact that they say, ``hey, we screwed up, send us a stamp,
and we\'ll send you some errata.\'\'  When was the last time you saw
another game company admit that they made a mistake?  When was the last
time you saw them correct it in a fashion other than reprinting the
book?

The one argument that I here is that GDW isn\'t producing quality
products.  I think that\'s utter rubbish!  I think that they are
producing some excellent products.  Some are definitely better than
others, but that doesn\'t make them all bad, and that doesn\'t even make
the ones we don\'t want to see bad (case in point H & I).

Everyone seems to trash every sourcebook as being ``bad\'\' if it\'s not
the sourcebook they\'re looking for.

Now, I\'ll be the first to admit that I\'ve been rather vocal (to put it
mildly) about some of the bonehead choices of products that GDW decides
to put out over others.

Let\'s looks at some of my personal favorite targets:

Personalities----The characters were in-depth, they actually felt like
real people, and I do think they add spice to a campaign.  This was a
good book.  Granted, I don\'t use it and I would\'ve prefered something
else to it, but that doesn\'t make it bad.  The only thing that would
have made this book better was by having it present personalities from
all around the galaxy.

H & I----What were you looking for, a reprint of the old Hivers book? 
The fact is that all of the alien modules will have to be printed from
the POV of the New Era.  So, some people didn\'t like all the 20th
century references.  But, it still provided an excellent depth of
character generation for both races, as well as supporting technology
and weapons.

Vampire Fleets----Honestly, I only bought it for the robot design
sequence addition to FFS.  I really don\'t care about Virus in the
outskirts of the RC since my campaign is far away from them.  This,
like personalities is one of those sourcebooks that could have been
better only if it showed Vampire Fleets from other parts of the galaxy.

The above products aren\'t poorly written or produced.  The packaging is
nice.  Overall, I do feel like I\'m getting my money\'s worth as far as
sheer workmanship and effort goes.  I think that we\'re all just
blasting whatever GDW puts out now as being bad because of the fact
that it\'s not for the type of campaign that we\'re (who ``we\'\' are, I
don\'t know) looking to run.

Bad products--nah.  Useless--maybe.  Better-Than-Most--definitely.

Now that is a book I wish that I could afford, or my local library had.  

Would you do me the favour of looking up the admiralty definition of a
cruiser (and light, heavy, etc flavours)? That is another term that has
shifted its meaning all over the place in the last 50 years.

I\'m not sure, but you might have been better posting this to XBOAT. However, 
here goes:

I don\'t have my lists to hand, but off the top of my head the values (in UK 
money) are:

Books 1 to 3 (A5 format) - about five pounds
Starter Traveller - about four pounds
A5 supplements, adventures, JTAS etc - about six to eight pounds each (some 
come up less often and are thus slightly more valuable)
Alien Modules - between two and ten pounds depending on which one it is
Azanti High Lightning - between thirty and fifty pounds (maybe more)

I don\'t know the rest offhand, but I\'ll check. All these prices do 
presuppose that the items are in good condition and that you are selling 
them privately. A second hand dealer will give you one third or less of 
these values.

Advice: For some of the especially rare stuff, you might consider the 
European GEN CON charity auction. You stand a good chance of making a mint, 
and you\'re helping a charity [typically a children\'s charity, although I 
think this year we burned Wesley Crusher for the Heart Foundation!].

Before you ask, I am not a second hand dealer, but I do like to keep in 
touch with how the secondhand prices are running.

Good luck.

There 
is a limit to how far a high-school kid can get with this kind of stuff.

The exploding gas giant - I sort of knew this wouldn\'t work, still nice
pseudo 
science though. How about a _real science_(?) scenario. Suppose the gas giant

atmosphere contained significant amounts of molecular fluorine. Under normal 
circumstances this would be extremely stable, but the sort of energy near a 
fusion exhaust could induce heterolytic fusion forming fluorine radicals.
These 
radicals would be incredibly reactive, and could induce very fast chain 
reactions like 
1/An explosion, the scale of which could be sufficiently large to almost 
subsititute for the star ignition idea.
2/Massive depletion of selected atmospheric compounds. Like terrestrial ozone

depletion, only much faster. This could cause problems for any gas giant 
ecosystem, but would have little effect to anything outside the gas giant 
atmosphere.

HEPlaR Drives - The EMP/radiation bit was a mistake (should have remembered 
those PAWs), but I will stick with my assertion that the exhaust would not be

easily visible. As an example, lets look at a Free Trader accelerating while 
travelling at 4 hexes per turn.
4 hexes per turn = 120,000,000m /30min = 66666m/s =67km/s

Fuel Expenditure
12.5m^3/ 30min = 0.00694m^3/s = 0.0005ton/s = 0.5kg/s

This fuel will be spread out along a path 67km long, and with a cross section
of 
about 5m^2 (half of the surface area of the thrusters). This gives a total 
volume of space of 335000m^3. The energy from the thruster would be spread
out 
all along this thread. It seems to me that the intensity of the emissions
from 
the exhaust would therefore be very low, and so hard to detect, compared to
more 
concentrated sources, like the engine nozzles themselves. 
As the ship travels faster, the exhaust stream will get longer, but this will

make it harder to detect not easier. The size of the target matters less to 
passive sensors than the energy output (fixed in a given expenditure of fuel)

and intensity (which decreases as the exhaust stream gets longer).

This does depend on how hot the exhaust is though, as Traveller seems to use
MWs 
of power with abandon the exhaust might be visible, but if you want to stick 
with the universe as presented by GDW, the explanation above will do.

This answers my question about realistic HePLAR.  I\'ll just pick an

	Wow!  Thanks for the technical detail.  What this means in game
terms I think is that ships will be able to spot bogies from a long way 
off.  They might not be able to get a targeting lock, but they will know 
someone is out there, maybe even system-wide.  This might not matter much 
if most combats take place within the 100d limit of the mainworld, but it 
also means that there will be little chance of hiding elsewhere in the 
system if you ever turn on your drive.
	Hmmm...  What about stealth drives?  A ship could intentionally 
run its drive "cool" by using extra reaction mass, but this would 
probably not reduce the plume signature signifigantly until fuel 
consumption become impossibly high.  What about exotic drives useful for 
their low sig but not otherwise practical?
	The other thing this brings up is the possibillity of 
intercepting intruders with "cruise" missiles which have their own HePLAR 
drives and sensors.  Because they could take higher G\'s than a 
human-crewed vessel, they could intercept the target more quickly, and 
since bogies can be detected so far off they would provide a stand-off 
attack capability.  Having their own drive would also allow them to carry 
a much larger warhead.  Any ideas on the max G tolerance of missile 
components?
	Thanks again to everyone who responded to my question.

I\'ve now checked and the values I gave in my earlier post a broadly correct 
for the UK market as it currently stands. Some of the other stuff you 
mentioned doesn\'t come up very often (specifically Invasion Earth and the 
Traveller hardback book - although I\'ve seen plenty of the softback copy) so 
any values I can quote you for those items are very much guesswork.

If you want to email me directly (on Dave.Elrick@ps.co.uk) with a list of 
items I\'ll be happy to discuss with you their value and the best course of 
action.

Alternatively, you can take them to a second-hand dealer and see what you 
can get for them (typically a _maximum_ of a third of the prices I quoted in 
my earlier post), but most of the dealers I know were heavily hit by the 
Magic: The Gathering tsunami and are struggling to keep going.

Another possibility is advertising in the small ads in Valkyrie or 
Challenge. Again, I\'ll be happy to help you out with possible prices.

Good luck.

As everyone who has fired using full automatic fire have noticed, that is
really noneconomical firing method. So the automatic fire rules of TNE works
quite well, but how to handle short controlled bursts? It is relevant to
know, because about 3-round bursts are most effective way to shoot (at least
in assaults with very little time to aim).

I have thought that you can fire 2 short bursts (3 or 5 round burst debending
on weapons ROF). At short range you get a bonus of +3/+5 to your to-hit 
asset. If you hit, then roll the dice to see how many of the bullets finally
hit the target. Beyond short range increase difficulty level by one for
to-hit. Those bonuses aply only to those, who can handle the recoil of 
burst(s). 

What do you think of this? Any comments or ideas are welcome.

Liam McCauley, 

I liked your conversion of M41A Pulse Rifle. Gasp! But the range was terribly
short compared to ACRs. But in close quarters that doesn\'t matter,
escpecially 
with bulk of 3.

I have allways thought that pulse rifle was supposed to be some kind of gauss
rifle, oh well so human mind makes mistakes. Does your source material
describe
why it is called \'pulse rifle\'?

Just out of curiosity. How close was the effectiveness compared to Aliens
stats?

What kind of ammunition that canister round was supposed to be? A chemical 
warhead?

I think the Hubble is able to "see" a candle far out as Jupiter, but then 
I\'m not sure. Detecting the drive plume depends on which way the radiation 
is aimed. Is it spread out, or pencil narrow, or something in between? If it 
is pencil narrow you have to be behind it it to detect it. Depending on the 
spread of the radiation from the plume, the sensing unit can sense from a 
wider angle. Another point is that TNE ships do not burn constantly, they 
usually coast along, making it fairly difficult to detect an incomming fleet 
at extreme ranges.


>Also, in my apologising post I made another mistake - \'heterolytic\' should

Doesn\'t matter I don\'t know what either of those things are anyway :)

Sorry Brendan - basic Chemistry wrong too.... Fluorine is one of the most 
reactive substances known!  It is *not* stable in a mixture with most chemicals, 
but will spontaneously react with almost anything you\'d find in a Gas giant!  
(The F-F bond is weak, but it forms very strong bonds with most other elements  
- witnes PTFE (poly-tetra-FLUOR-ethylene) one of the most inert substances 
known, due to the strength of the C-F bond.)

>but the sort of energy near a 
>fusion exhaust could induce heterolytic fusion forming fluorine radicals. 

no - the heat energy in the high temperature fusion exhaust could break most 
chemical bonds (including C-F), but will *not* induce fusion, not even 
<heterolytic fusion> whatever that might be! 

Yes, dumping a few thousand tons of free radicals in your wake would be 
interesting, but still not as spectacular as you\'d like.  Most of the enrgy 
released from re-forming bonds with the free radicals will be the energy that 
went into breaking them in the first place (ie that of the fusion trail)
There will be some from "latent chemical energy" in the other compounds, but not 
a huge amount.

>These

For comparison of scale - the modest sized blotches on jupiter after the comet 
impact were as large as our entire planet(!) but small compared to Jupiter.
It would take *weeks* for reactions to progress that far!  Jupiter is probably a 
hotbed of chemical reactions anyway, and i don\'t think a trail of radicals will 
do much to chnage that...

true the exhausts glow (but are usually designed with baffles to prevent easy 
detection - the designers knew about that bit!)
as far as the con-trail glowing, a rough guess would be to compare it with the 
tail of a Comet, which glows by reflected sunlight on a tenuous gas cloud - and 
comets are visible a long way off in telescopes; and often visible to the naked 
eye...

actually the energy flux alone is all that matters for small sources - on a 
wide-field camera you are imaging the enrgy into a small area, and summing the 
flux.  You are fighting inverse-square law diminishment of the flux though, and 
try to compensate by increasing the area of the detector\'s collectors (increase 
diameter).
[And just like current satellites, don\'t point your passive EMS array at
a) the sun or b) a nearby drive flare, \'cos you\'kll burn off the sensitive 
receptor surfaces!]

>MWs 
Yes - Boltzman\'s law puts the radiance as proportional to the 4th power of the 
temperature of the radiating black body (the gas). this means that at fusion or 
helpar temperatures, the gas radiates almost all of its energy very quickly, and 
cools enormously.
The brightest emitting part of the flare is confined to relatively close to the 
drive (say 1 sec, at 67km/s = 67km), 
But the rest of the flare *will* act as a reflector and diffusor scattering the 
light of the radiant flare and the unbaffled parts of the drive emissions.

I think Seawolf anti-missile missiles on todays destroyers do about 25 
(twentyfive) Gs! (and only using chemical thrusters...)
Trav missiles at 6G ish are pretty pathetic really...

I\'d guess 10-20,000K as a plasma temperature.... and NO I don\'t want to go near 
it, or allow it anywhere near my settlements! (I\'ve said this before).
You can cool the plasma by spereading the energy over more mass, but that drains 
the reaction mass very quickly.
I suppose in atmosphere, you could draw in vast quantities of air, and heat it, 
like todays new high bypass turbojets, but then youre no longer emitting plasma, 
just hot air.......

therein lies the nub - it isn\'t at all. It declines fast: proportionally to
(temp)^4, and the temp depends on the remaining energy
Watch a lightbulb cool down from a few hundred C (~500-600K) when you turn the
power off, and this plasma is cooling faster than that, but from a much higher
temperature.

more like 100MW over 10-100km: 1-10MW/km, 1-10kW/m
pretty bright actually.

also the sensors will image many km or flare onto each pixel cell in the
sonsor\'s imager, thereby summing the intensity over many km (unless they\'re very
close).

Radio telescope can detect gas clouds glowing light years away...

Nope.  Molecular fluorine is extremely _un_stable -- it reacts with virtually
anything.  I believe _water_ "burns" in the presence of molecular fluorine
gas.  It\'s even worse than oxygen, which reacts (rust, fires, etc.) with all
manner of things and disappears rapidly from an atmosphere unless replenished
by an active biosphere.

In addition, fluorine is relatively rare in the universe.  There was an
article lo these many years ago in Analog SF... I believe the author was
John Gribbin, and I know the title was something like "What About Those
Halogen Breathers?"  A good library might have back issues, and you can
track it down from the indices in the January issues for the previous year.
(Riffles through collection....)  Here we are.  October, 1984, page 60,
"Those Halogen Breathers", by Stephen L. Gillett, Ph.D. (I was close!).
He points out:

	"O.K., now let\'s look at fluorine....  only one isotope is stable,
19F with ten neutrons.  This single isotope is about one-third as abundant
as 17O, the rarest isotope of oxygen.  Already we can see problems a-brewing;
fluorine is _rare_.
	Worse than this, fluorine is ferociously reactive.  It is the most
electronegative element known, and replaces oxygen in its compounds at
slight (or no) provocation.  Under proper circumstances, fluorine will
combine with _everything_ except the three lightest noble gases, helium,
neon, and argon.  It\'s gonna be hard to force F2 to accumulate in an
atmosphere."

It\'s a splendid article, and highly recommended for world-builders.

But that\'s just what I\'m objecting to: You\'re making an interpretation 
that is logical enough, but just happens to be about one of the already 
established snippets of information that we have and turns out to be
wrong. I suspected that you didn\'t have access to that information and
therefor informed you about it. To reiterate: In several CT modules
(One of the Library Data books and _Traveller Adventure_) is a short
article about the history of the settlement of Spinward Marches. In it
are three maps that shows the settlement pattern for the Marches in
the years 300, 400, and 500. They show that Mertactor was 1) already
settled by the year 300 and 2) not yet part of the Imperium by the year
500.

Indeed it would if we hadn\'t happened to have some _other_ evidence on
the subject. As it is, we _know_ that Mertactor was settled already by
the year 300, while others (the whole spinward half of District 268)
wasn\'t.

Specious. Why dosen\'t Mora just deny entry to the colonists they don\'t want?
Unless Imperial law forbids a planet to keep out immigrants (which I grant
you _may_ be the case). But in that case it seem extremely impropable the 
Imperial law would allow Mora to _export_ them against their will. (And
where DO you get your figures? Billions of immigrants? Again, think of the
cost.)

Because the cost of shipping emigrants across the Atlantic was low enough
that even poor people might manage to scrape together enough for the fare.
The cost of shipping people across even a subsector is something only
well-off people can afford. And you\'re talking about shipping them across
several sectors now.

Again you\'re ignoring the high cost. If you\'ve paid for a colonization ship
you\'re going to want to settle somewhere where YOU are in charge. And in
any case, if the colonists came from somewhere else and were merely refused
permission to settle on Mora, how can we say that Mertactor was settled
from Mora? Surely that implies that the settlers were _from_ Mora. Not just
that they had visited there.

No, you missed the salient part of my argument. How can someone be said to

No, it is not the same costs as I went on to demonstrate. One involves
buying a ship and take it with you, the other buying a ship and use it
to export someone else.

Not discussed above. I pointed out that the cost of exporting one colonist
by the "buy them a ship and send them off" method was equivalent to the
naval taxes of 20,000 people for a year. I consider that to be prohibitively
high. If you choose to believe that any politician would consider that a
reasonable price then we just have to disagree on that point.

That\'s the very same mistake GDW keeps making. It\'s a technique that only
works if you have a good enough sense of proportion that your historical
facts lands within the realm of the possible. Furthermore, you again miss
the salient point of my argument: that even if the costs becomes reasonable
then moving the exportees to some planet one or two or three jumps away is
significantly cheaper than moving them NINE jumps. The use of ships to
relieve population pressure is expensive, and it won\'t work, but there 
could be other reasons that makes it worthwhile to the government (getting
rid of dissidents, propaganda value, etc.); the chioce of a planet some
way off may also make political sense that outweighs economic sense; but the 
chois of a planet NINE jumps away is unlikely to say the least. A matter of
simple economs.

I still think that you can stuff the soils with chemicals and the air with
CO2 as much as you like but without water it\'s still going to be a desert.
However, I don\'t know enough about the subject to be dogmatic about it.

Well, on the point of when Mertactor was settled there\'s no question about
feelings. Yoy haven\'t. On the point about the colonists coming from Mora
it is a matter of feeling. I conceed that is\'t physically possible and
dosen\'t contradict any previously established fact. But I consider it 
sociologically unlikely. Not just unlikely to the point of being interesting
-  which is a thing I approve of; it enhances the ambience of the game when
things aren\'t exactly like one would expect it to be  -  but to the point
of being disruptive of my "suspension of disbelief". So, yes, it\'s just a
feeling. But there are still solid arguments behind the feeling.

>But then, I have no control over that.  

Yes you have. You can convince me that my arguments are wrong, or you can
let yourself be convinced that my arguments are right and change the info.
Either way will work just fine.

Hmmm... perhaps we\'ve been arguing at cross-purposes. I thought that these
RICE papers were supposed to describe things as they might be in the GDW
universe. If you say that it just describes the way things are in YOUR
Traveller universe then a lot of my arguments are futile. I may still
think that you social dynamics are flawed, but then, you\'re perfectly
entitled to make your Traveller universe anything you like.

Possibly. But remember, the cost of running them is what I used to base my

Exactly. If the Morans owned the original ships (First type of scenario)
then they would most propably have been dismantled to form the first
settlement (would have been designed to be thus dismantled); if they didn\'t
then the ships would have returned to the original world (Deneb, wasn\'t it?)

>but how would this suggestion affect the cost-worthiness of the proposal?

It helps, of course, but you\'re still stuck with the basic economic problem
that no matter what the costs, the closer to Mora you dump the exportees,
the more cost effective it is.

     RECRUITING:  ADVANCED RULES
     
     Recruiting involves the active pursuit of personnel to be hired for a 
     task, contract or long-term position.  Most often used in the 
     mercenary field, Recruiting skill enables its user to locate 
     individuals suitable for employment using a variety of methods.  These 
     methods include posting job listings in local publications and/or 
     computer bulletin boards, frequenting establishments at which the 
     desired personnel may be located, and networking with one\'s contacts 
     and other individuals who may come into contact with potential 
     recruits.
     
     Successful recruiting depends on a number of facets.  Among them are:
     
     --Recruiting Skill
     --Population
     --Sampling Rate
     --Military Proximity
     --Starport Level
     
     Recruiting skill is far and away the most important facet.  A good 
     recruiter can find potential recruits in just about any populated 
     environment.  The higher the recruiter\'s skill, the better he is at 
     beating the bushes for potential employees.
     
     Basically, recruiting depends on a successful task roll made at 
     Difficult level.  If the individual succeeds, he successfully locates 
     a qualified corps of potential recruits.  No success indicates an 
     inability to find viable recruits. Future attempts at recruiting in 
     that system will not be possible until two weeks have passed.  
     Catastrophic failure indicates the same as failure except that the 
     user cannot find any viable candidates for 30 days in that system.  At 
     the end of the established period, the recruiter may attempt to 
     recruit in the same system without penalty.  If the recruiting task 
     was successful, the individual may attempt to recruit in the same 
     system after two weeks have passed, modified by the appropriate DMs, 
     listed below.  Any attempts to do so before two weeks have passed will 
     meet with automatic failure.
     
     The following DMs are applied to recruiting rolls:
     
     
     Die Modifier (DM)
     
     ----
     RECRUITING SKILL    +Recruiting Skill (as per normal at Difficult 
     level)
     POPULATION          -1 if Low Pop     0 if Med Pop     +1 if High Pop 
     SAMPLING RATE (EFFECTS NOT CUMULATIVE)
     -2 if same system sampled within 30 days -1 if same system sampled 
     within 60 days
     0 if system not sampled within 60 days or more
     MILITARY PROXIMITY  +1 if naval base present and hiring ship\'s crew or
     mercenaries
     0 if no military base present
     +1 if Government 7 or Law Level 0-3 (and hiring mercenaries)
     STARPORT LEVEL      +1 if Starport A (+2 if recruiting trader crew)
     0 if Starport B-D (+1 if recruiting trader crew)
     -1 if Starport E-X (0 if recruiting trader crew)
     
     If the recruiter is successful, he is able to muster a number of 
     recruits equal to his Recruiting skill level (not his asset level, but 
     his skill level).  If he achieves exceptional success, he is able to 
     muster a number of potential recruits equal to twice his Recruiting 
     skill level, modified by the rules listed below.
     
     The potential recruits will present themselves within a number of days 
     equal to 2D/Recruiting Skill (drop fractions).  For example, Esteban 
     has a Recruiting skill level of 3.  A roll of 2D achieves a result of 
     7.  Dividing 7 by 3, we obtain 2.333 as our result.  Fractions are 
     dropped, for a final total of 2.  Esteban\'s recruits will appear 
     within two days of his initial Recruiting attempt.
     
     Ambitious referees may optionally choose to modify the above rules for 
     roleplaying purposes.  You may want to require several methods of 
     recruiting and apply appropriate DMs, depending on the ambitiousness 
     of the recruiting methods of your player(s).
     
     Attempts by multiple individuals to recruit may not be pooled together 
     for a more favorable DM.  Instead, each individual\'s recruiting task 
     is handled separately.  However, there is a maximum effectiveness that 
     one group can have in collective recruiting efforts.  To determine the 
     limitations on number of recruits, first determine the total 
     recruiting skill levels of the members of your group. If the number of 
     Recruiting skill points exceeds two times the planetary population UWP 
     digit, the total number of recruits beyond 2 x UWP is to be divided by 
     two (drop fractions).
     
     For example, Esteban and his group are rather prolific at recruiting.  
     The entire group, including Esteban, has 10 levels of Recruiting 
     skill.  Everyone achieves standard success on their Recruiting rolls.  
     They are recruiting from a planet with a population UWP digit of 4.  
     To find out the total number of recruits obtained, we subtract two 
     times the UWP digit (2 x 4 in this case, for a result of 8) from the 
     total levels of Recruiting skill (10).  The result is two.  We divide 
     this number by two to achieve a result of one.  Esteban and his group 
     therefore acquire a total of nine recruits.

>Radio telescope can detect gas clouds glowing light years away...


Which brings up some interesting thoughts about detecting space craft from a
distance.  If a radio telescope can detect gas clouds, I wonder if part of
the sensor array on a warship (or other ships) would be very directional
radio recievers set to detect exhaust plumes from ships and/or missle
ordinance.  Or maybe the energy levels are too low?  How about detectors in
the noses of ordinance?  That would make for a nasty way of "locking on" to
a ship\'s engineering plant. 

That idea was offered (I believe) in Star Trek "The New Frontier" for a
photon torpedo\'s guidance system OBTW...

Just read Steven Hawkin\'s book "A Breif History of Time" and some of the
points raised in the book make for some interesting problems for Traveller
and space faring society at large.

Given that everything in the universe is moving (quickly!) how do you
calculate where things are in space?  The light you see from a distant star
system may or may not really give you a clue as to its location.  In the
time it takes for light or other radiation from a star system to get to you
the object has moved from the point it was when the light was emitted.  Same
for your perspective in space.  The place you are observing from is *also*
moving so that changes the "value" for the observation even more...

So what is a navigator to do?  This makes navigating in space REAL
interesting...

Yeah, I thought they\'d be too big for a skateboard.

Huh? Shirly that\'s 43kg?

I was thinking of adding ducted fans for more thrust, and solar panels for
more power. If I get time, I\'ll try it tonight.

HEPLAR is used on air/rafts etc - isn\'t this a bit anti-social for use in
built-up areas?

     Yes, I have.  But if you think whipping up a few figures on a

     coming from rather different angles.  My observations about human 
     motives are that as a race, we can be extremely irrational and do 
     things for reasons that our descendents will question as ludicrous.  
     In short, anything is possible.  Cost doesn\'t factor into it.
     
     Pick up a book on any region\'s history and you\'ll find descriptions of

     want to.  I envisioned the standard atmosphere, the presence of 20 
     percent water and the fact that my World Builder\'s Handbook die roll

     I have quite a bit of the documentation on Traveller history, but not 
     all of it.  Generally I use the two Library Data Supplements, the 
     MegaTraveller Imperial Encyclopaedia, Survival Margin, what JTAS, 
     MegaTraveller Journal and Challenge issues I have and the DGP aliens 
     modules.  I\'ve noticed that there\'s a lot more background material in 
     such books as The Spinward Marches Campaign (which I can\'t find a copy

Wien\'s Displacement Law, which states that the peak wavelength of emitted
photons is given by:

	Lambda(max) * T = 0.29 cm*K

Given the high temperature of the emitted reaction mass (which I don\'t
have handy), I suspect you\'d get quite short-wavelength radiation, very
possibly even in the X-ray range, which should be FAR easier to detect
than mere thermal (infrared) emissions, and also less characteristic of
"harmless" natural phenomena.  I know *I\'d* perk up if a raging X-ray
source streaked into the solar system!

I suspect this, along with thermal radiation from those huge fusion
plants, is exactly what is used in the "lock-on" from Brilliant Lances
et alia.  This doesn\'t help for contact missiles (which it sounds like
some people are re-proposing), since Traveller lasers are such awesome
point-defense weapons in interplanetary space.  (Would that we had a
harder-sf universe without gravitic focussing, but then it wouldn\'t be
Traveller any more... :-)  Detonation-laser missiles, of course, would
use the same targetting and tracking information as larger vessels do:
they can just afford to get closer to deliver their punch.

<shrug>  You\'re both moving around the galactic center, so you use that
for reference, subtract out its motion through space, then just adjust for
individual variances.  Since stars are unlikely to arbitrarily change their
direction of motion, you make sure you have an adequate base of observations
of proper motion, red/blue shift of spectral lines, etc. so that you can 
predict the destination star\'s movements.  Yes, it might get tricky if we
were going from here to the Larger Magellanic Cloud, or between different
spiral arms all in one hop, but for distances of one to six parsecs, I doubt
it makes that much of a difference.  Perhaps you just have to make a little
extra boost at the end of the trip to "catch up" on the star\'s (or planet\'s)
orbital motion.

	The same way we navigate stuff here in our own solar
system...triangulate from known locations, or at least known 
vectors. We use specific, bright, distant stars...I\'ll be that
Traveller navigators use specific, bright, distant galaxies, or
quasars.  Everything IS moving in the universe, but almost
everything is moving in a simple path. Yes, the light you see isn\'t
really where the object is, but you know it\'s vector in relation to
your anchor objects, and the rest, as they say, is trivial. Note,
this is the mathematic trivial, where you may need TL 17 massively
parallel computer systems to perform those `trivial\' calculations. 
All it takes, in a relativistic universe, is to designate some known
point as `zero point\', calculate all your vectors on that, and
navigating is easy. The trick is to pick distant enough reference
points so that drift in your system from the movement of those
`anchors\' are insignificant to your calculations. This reduces
navigation from a relativistic to newtonian physics. Yes, your
astrogation tables may move out of synch by miles per year, but
exact location doesn\'t matter, all you need is to do is get close
enough for Imperial work.

	This does raise the fact that survey ships will have some pretty
robust astrogational computer systems and programs.  Most other
ships would use lookup tables.

As former USN Firecontrol Tech, the system that I used had a low 
light camera that could track a aircraft at night, if the aircraft 
had a single cockpit intrument light on, at 20nm under optimal 
conditions. the technology of this camera used a vidicon tube, circa 
1970\'s technology. At various times on cruises we tracked satelites 
going overhead at night under various conditions. Extrapolating to todays\'s 
technology it easy to track a 100w bulb to over 100nm. At TNE tech 
levels it would be easy to detect such a trail at over 5 light secs 
provided the background did not mask out the trail.

I would like to thank everyone who pointed out the error in mass on the
Hoverboard. Checking that little conversion chart in the front of FF&S, yes
1 tonne is 1000kg and not 2000kg as i have calculated.  But still, 43kg is
relatively heavy to cary arround (it\'s 43kgx2.2=94.6lbs! I am sure that 2.2
is the conversion ;)  ).  This was done before I had the RC Equipment
Rulebook and the Grav-belt upgrade rules, I am currently working on using
this to upgrade the Hoverboard, call it Hoverboard version 2.0! :) I hope I
do get a skatebard this time (maybe if the the TL was 15....)

As Andrew Boulton pointed out, yes there is room on the thing for boosters,
thrusters, computer controlled terain following avionics, etc...

Have fun with the idea and again thanks for the errata!

Huh?  This would *help* KE missiles.  They can use passive homing, and since
they\'re small, you might not ever know you\'re locked on.  Remember that 
missiles (for the most part) don\'t use fusion drives of any sort, they\'re
chemical rockets.  And lasers aren\'t very good since using the sensor rules 
you\'d never even see them :) (in BL, anyway)

Actually, when I did my various sensor rules, I made off-axis line of sights
give a small diffmod, but maybe it should be higher.  What about EMM?

I need to think about the exhaust more... hmmm (fun, fun :)

OK...assume that your ship\'s just emerged from Jump....

To establish a sky "reference grid" (i.e. which way is celestial
north) make all-sky passive EMS scan looking for quasars ---- bright
optical (and often radio) sources associated with massive active
galaxies at extreme distances (gigaparsecs). Since quasars are so far
away, they won\'t be affected by parallax, and the quasar "sky" will
look the same wherever you are in the galaxy. Now the navigator knows
which way is up...

To establish _where_ you are, assuming no artificial aids (nav beacons
etc.): This is trickier, because the point of origin, the destination
system and all the stars around are moving on different orbits about the
galaxy\'s centre of gravity, taking about 225 million years to do one
orbit. Typical differences in velocity between one star and another
are 10\'s to 100\'s of km per sec. Stars _do_ move around, and 1st
Imperium-era charts could be _seriously_ wrong by 1200 (systems in the
wrong hex!).

Natural beacons include bright O-type stars, which are both
rare, and readily visible from long distances ("oh, that must be
Deneb!"), and pulsars (rapidly-rotating neutron stars) which have the
added advantage of being pretty accurate clocks with well-defined slow-down
rates. Observe half a dozen or so pulsars ---- their positions on the sky
will tell you where you are, and their current "pulse rates" will tell
you _when_ you are and how fast you\'re moving.

Oh, I forgot to mention...the pulsars are moving as well, faster than
the stars are (>300 km/sec). Better make sure that your charts are up
to date :-)

A colleague of mine is here at Jodrell Bank is conducting a
pulsar parallax survey...her work could form the basis of the first
starship charts!

given the subject header, it seems you misunderstand the speeds involved:  for 
relativity to have significant effects, you have to be travelling a significant 
fraction of the speed of light! Anything less than  0.01c can be ignored for 
most purposes.

not really - the stars motions have been tracked and catalogued for a long time 
(referred to as their "proper motion" rather than their apparent motion as the 
observer moves)
These proper motions are modest (5-50km/s) and subject to all the normal laws of 
gravity and motion - and can be predicted with good accuracy for long periods.  
Most of the time stars are so far from each other that they can be treated as 
moving through a uniform gravitational field due to the galaxy as a whole, with 
gradual variations on lang time scales (10,000\'s of years).

>  Same
>for your perspective in space.  The place you are observing from is *also*

you just pick a reasonable large frame of reference, such as the galaxy as a 
whole, or better, the frame defined by the average of all the nearby galaxies, 
and measure yourself and the other stars relative to that.  The fact that your 
overall from may be drfiting doesn\'t actually matter.  [For the curios, it 
doesn\'t matter if your frame is moving *uniformly*, and if it is accellerating, 
you can tell - accelleration is absolute.]

General Relativity provides the maths to use in all cases, including those where 
you haven\'t a clue as to who is moving... 

>So what is a navigator to do?  This makes navigating in space REAL
>interesting...

use the standard Nav. programs bought from MegaHard(tm) your local galactic SC 
(Ship\'s Computer) supplier... They have relativistic corrections already built 
in.. You can even jump at near-light-speed (if you can get up to it) and come 
out with the same vector -- its your own problem to slow down again...

     Rifle design.  Thanks also for any compliments.  I\'m especially glad 
     to hear that it might get used in someone else\'s campaign.
     
     I\'ve re-done the design using Lahtinen\'s caseless ammo notes, and will 
     put the summary at the end of this post.
     
     The low short range for the weapon is due to the very short barrel 
     length (24.7cm c.f. average barrel length of 49cm for the ammo), and 
     because the ammo is HEAP (0.75 multiplier).  I imagine that this would 
     give it a hell of a muzzle flash.
     
     The cannister round for the grenade launcher that someone asked about 
     simply holds buckshot.  Being lazy, I couldn\'t be bothered going 
     through the full sequence for the ammo again, so I just left it as an 
     exercise for the reader ;-).
     
     I noticed that the only thing that would change if I dropped the TL 
     from 12 to 10 would be the explosive energy of the HEAP round.  This 
     gives a damage of 5, rather than 6.  Are there no other developments 
     in standard slug weapon design above TL 10?
     
     There are a few things I would change if I was designing the weapon 
     myself from scratch (longer barrel, shorter cartridge to improve range 
     and recoil), but I wanted to stay close to the parameters I had been 
     given.  These were (from "Aliens: Colonial Marines Training Manual"):

We came across this problem on a smaller scale several years ago and this is 
the solution we came up with (it works quite well for your problem too).

Note: I am not an astrophysicist. This was the non-technical \'fix\' we came 
up with for our game.

The question that came up was: "Given that the bodies in a star system are 
orbiting the star, how do we know where everything is when we jump 
insystem?"

The answer that we came up with was that everything is moving at an 
observable rate. If we take the known positions of everything in the system 
[or area] at a certain date [say 001/900] and add the calculated rate of 
movement to each body up to the projected date, we come out at a fair 
approximation of the relative positions of everything in the system.

Now you know what the navigation program is calculating while you are 
preparing for jump.

Most of the Scottish immigrants came to America and Canada because the 
landowners forced them off the land and destroyed their homes to make way 
for sheep and that\'s where the ships were going.

In fact many landowners \'tried\' the people in the so-called \'peasant trials\' 
(where they were charged with not attempting to improve their living 
conditions - sad, but true) to justify throwing them off the land.

Many of the Irish immigrants came to America after the failure of the potato 
crop in the hope of escaping the resulting famine.

Pleasure.

<quote>
Cruiser: Cruisers are general-purpose fighting ships whose main function is 
to provide close cover and anti-aircraft support to convoys or carrier task 
groups. They combine hitting power with speed, manoeverability and 
endurance. Their turrets mount medium-calibre guns capable of a high rate of 
fire and are automatically controlled. They can be recognised by their 
turrets and extensive superstructure. They displace from 12,000 to 14,500 
tons, and have an overall length of between 555 and 613 ft.
<end quote>

This is the 1960\'s definition and is written with RN Cruisers in mind (the 
only RN Cruiser still intact is HMS Belfast which is moored in London and is 
open to the public). Note that this (apart from the dimensions, etc.) is an 
almost exact description of the role of the Type 22 frigate!

Thereby hangs a tale....

In the late 1960\'s the then ruling Labour party (under the defence 
secretary, Denis Healy) produced a report which showed that the RAF could 
project airpower to any part of the globe where British interests might be 
under threat (get an atlas out and think about that for a while!). On the 
basis of this, they set in motion the scrapping of the three remaining 
aircraft carriers in RN service and the winding down of the cruiser fleet.

Then, possibly realising their mistake, they authorised the design and 
production of the Invincible class of ships (currently in service) - but 
they were officially to be called \'through-deck cruisers\' despite their 
obviously being aircraft carriers!

The Imperial Ministry of Colonization might get involved.  This might not
help one-shot expenses, but they would be interested in possession of the
big colony ships, even old ones, over the long term.  The transports might
also have value to the Imperial armed forces in wartime.  The rest of the
time, somebody could probably find a use for them.  So one option may be 
that the planetary government can lease/charter the starships from the 
Imperial government.  Building a ship just to dismantle it at the far end 
of the trip seems awfully wasteful, in the Traveller universe.

There\'s a precedent for colonization from Mora to District 268; Tarsus was
supposedly colonized from Fornice/Mora in the 450s.  According to the maps
in Traveller Adventure, it was one of the nearest worlds outside the 
settled region at the time.  The situation as presented is that Fornice,
an early colony, was feeling population pressure.  Certain early colonists
on Fornice with large landholdings were convinced to sell the land to the
government for development, and in exchange the government would transport
them to found a new colony on Tarsus, which had a better atmosphere for
agriculture.  It was supposed to be a desperation move.  It took them 12
years to move all the colonists.  I suppose they could have colonized a
nearer world, but it would have already had settlers there.

How economical is this?  Well, I grabbed a tech-14 jump-4 Tukera freighter
from WTH; it\'s a bit advanced for the era, but it\'ll do.  Rip out all the
passenger staterooms and low berths, and install a fuel purification unit.
Payload is 1057 displacement-tons of cargo.  Replace the steward with a
second doctor.  The ship is streamlined, so it can ocean refuel if needed.
The ship will jump as close as it can to the best fuel source, and jump
as soon as it can get fuel and get back to a jump point.

Fornice charters the ship, at standard TNE rates, doesn\'t matter from who
yet.  Charter price is Cr 900 per ton cargo or low berth per two weeks.
They must pay Cr 951300 to the owner every two weeks to charter the ship.
Assume that they have to pay the charter fee to bring the empty ship back,
although everything in between is settled and it might be able to trade.
Let\'s say it takes eighteen weeks for the ship to make fourteen jumps,
stopping only to wilderness refuel and unload at the colony.  Charter cost 
is MCr 8.5.

You\'d have to design the colony to find out for sure, but lets say that
each colonist needs six tons of cargo in startup supplies, at a value
of about kCr 20.  We can then ship 150 colonists in low berths.  Cost of
transport and supplies per colonist is about kCr 76700, to get from 
Fornice to Tarsus and bring the ship back.  Not much worse than high 
passage for the same trip.  This would need to be tweaked a bit to get 
the right number of doctors on the crew for the low passengers, but it\'s 
pretty close.   

How does the ship owner do?  Wilderness fuel and berthing are free.  
Maintenance is kCr 271.  Life support is kCr 576 + Cr 100 per low berth.
Salaries are probably kCr 180 to 360.  The 480-month mortgage is a 
2080-week mortgage, and would be kCr 6720 or so for this period.  The 
charter company will earn over kCr 620 in eighteen weeks of operation,
which isn\'t bad.  

If you wanted to do something like the Forboldn Project from the old
Kinunir library data, and send colonists from the Core, you\'d be best
off shipping the colonists in low berths on the jump-4 trade routes 
most of the way, and obtaining the equipment as close to the colony 
as possible to cut shipping costs.  There\'s no point in bringing things 
from the Core that you can as easily make in the Marches.  But that 
sort of project would be *very* pricey in any case, as Hans points 
out.

Steve Jackson Games.  For ANY thing they ever published,
they produce errata (if necessary).  And they send it to
you on request.  Free.  No SASE necessary.  I think their
errata is available through their BBS, but I\'m not sure.

SJG\'s material also seem to have a lot lower density of errors
than GDW\'s material in the last 5 years, sorry to say.  GDW\'s
errors are more content-related than SJG\'s (from what I have 
seen).  A lot GDW\'s FF&S errata seems to have been caused by 
testing done AFTER material is published.  That is shoddy 
workmanship that I would rather not have to pay for. 

A lot of the writing itself is rather well-done.  I hate the 
Virus AND the RC campaign (for different reasons), but "Path 
of Tears" was a good (borrowed) read.  But when they write
"black" on one page and a few pages later declare that "white"
is and always has been standard, they detract from the value of 
their work.

These are fine definitions for late 20th century warship design.  They 
are not
accurate to describe mid-century (WWII) ship design, early 20thC ship design,
19thC ship design etc.  

Also note that the Russian recent practice has been to specialize 
destroyers for
AA or ASW work.

This is recent English practice only. US Naval practice usually has these 
facilities aboard a cruiser, aircraft carrier, assault ship, or command ship.
French practice runs to command facilities on cruisers or a/c carriers...
The Russians go for command facilities on cruisers or helicarriers...

"(Line of ) Battleship," "Frigate," and "Corvette" or "Sloop" used to be 
based 
on weight and the number of gun decks its guns were mounted on. "Frigate" 
& 
"Cruiser" used to be equivalent.

The point is that while accurate for this point in time, yours (or any 
other 
specific definitions) need not be the guiding influence used at any specific
point in time - though the "relative" sizes will probabaly not change.

Granted, there were some problems with their initial design.  But GDW
thought that they were doing it right by doing it their way (lower
powered plasma and fusion weapons come to mind).  But, they did change
it when they realized that they may have made a boo-boo.  Likewise,
they did include the alternative techs for people that wanted to create
devices outside the scopy of The New Era (for example, all of us that
wanted to stick to original CT and MT stuff like thruster plates, etc).
How many other companies give you that kind of option (no, GURPS

AIUI, a cruiser is halfway between a DD and a BB - more guns & armour than
a destroyer, but lighter and faster than a battleship.

This makes hi-g drives more useful: you can do all the thrusting quickly,

     philosophy I use.
     
     I\'ve adopted several of the papers from other writers as "reality" in 
     my own campaign, including the Jewell, Menorb and Glisten papers.  
     Some of the others I have either edited for my own purposes or decided

There is _no_way_, at canonical Traveller distances and speeds, that missiles
will be able to use normal, impact-capable chemical rockets, unless they\'re
the size of Saturn V\'s.  The speeds and vectors involved, the precise
targeting adjustments needed to reach and strike a ship, are horrendous.
Try the math involved: you\'ll find the same result GDW did.  When they made
space combat ranges as long as they "ought" to be, they simultaneously forced
themselves into invoking "gravitic focussing" to make lasers practical, and
sounded the death-knell for conventional impact missiles.  Instead, missiles
should be more like 2300 AD\'s unmanned drones, built and equipped exactly
like
small craft except for the lack of crew.

Note that I\'ve never designed a Traveller missile.  Looking up the relevant 
info, I find that FFS, on p. 146, confirms that "most space missiles use
EAPlaC solid-fuel thrusters", defined on FFS p. 70 defined as "Electrothermal

Augmented Plasma Combustion" (as opposed to HEPlaR\'s "High-Efficiency Plasma
Recombustion", which we know does not "combust" using oxygen -- a misnomer?)
I\'d warrant that EAPlaC\'s are closer to fusion rockets (which share their
tech
level) or HEPlaR\'s than the earlier, pure chemical rockets: they\'d use a
high-
energy power source (fission or fusion) to heat and expel reaction mass,
something like the Nerva rockets the US experimented with briefly.

Whatever the propulsion method, if it involves "plasma" then your exhaust
is going to have the same problems as those we\'ve discussed for larger craft.
Given the grotesque ranges and efficiencies given to lasers, the target has
plenty of time to shoot a contact missile full of holes before it reaches
him.  The far more practical solution is to use the same advantage against
him, and design a missile to sneak up to within a BL hex or more (a far
simpler task than nosing right up to the hull!) and destroy itself to pump
a detonation laser: as the canonical TNE material describes.

Impact missiles are dead, dead, dead.  :-)

Looking at a star 5 light years away, you know where it was relative to you
five 
years ago (determining range is tricky, but I think it can be done with some 
degree of accuracy using methods like parallax). Next you record the position
of 
the star a while later relative to your position. Now by comparing the
positions 
of the star at two points you can work out its velocity relative to you, five

years ago. Unless the star moves near another massive body in five years,
then 
it\'s direction won\'t change much, so you can extrapolate the position from
its 
known position and velocity in the past. Even if it does move near other
bodies, 
you can work out its path if you know the masses and motions of the others. 
There are lots of things that can make this even harder, like light bending 
around masses, but it should be possible to get fairly close.

Any sort of drive that will get humanity any real distance in space would 
probably have enough excess range that you could \'miss\' a bit anyway.
Traveller 
Jumpdrive doesn\'t let you correct in midflight though, so it is possible to 
miss, if this kind of information isn\'t available, such as for a rift fuel
cache 
from before the final war.

Okay, I was wrong about exhaust visibility, I found out where I, er, \'lost\' a

few decimal places.
The tactical problems of the exhaust are least significant to large fleets,
who 
want people to see and engage them. However, for corsairs, the traders trying
to 
sneak past the corsairs, covert operations etc. (all the stuff which is
likely 
to involve the players) it is a bit of a downer. 
A few ideas on ways to get round it:
1/Black globes. In traveller, black globes have two distinct sides - the
outside 
absorbs energy and shunts it to the ship, and the inside destroys the
generator 
if it absorbs any significant amount of energy (otherwise it would be
possible 
to make some maneuver burns with the field up). Under the heading \'Important 
Note\' in FFS it mentions that if a large mass comes in contact with the
shield, 
then the shield is destroyed  - as it trys to cool the mass to absolute zero.

Imagine a field put up \'inside out\', with the drive exhaust passing through
it. 
Now it absorbs the energy from the exhaust, cooling it so it\'s invisible and 
giving all the energy back to the ship. This energy could then be put back
into 
the drive itself, allowing HEPlaR to realistically (within the bounds of the 
universe as presented in TNE, not the real world as such) be as efficient as
it 
is presented, because there is no energy wasted in producing a hot exhaust.
The 
amount of matter in the exhaust is well within the bounds of what a black
globe 
can cope with (50 tons displacement as a single object - the exhaust is more 
spread out than this). 
This 100% conversion of heat to electricity means that a miniature inverted 
black globe could be used as a key component in any power plant, surrounding 
the hot reactor core. Previously, I had always wondered why there was a big
jump 
in fusion plant power output between TL14 and TL15, but black globes are 
introduced at TL15, so this seems to tie in (could still be a coincidence,
but 
this is a nice explanation). An inverted black globe used to cover the
exhaust 
could be probably be focussed down to a disc, so the ship could still see out

around it. This is still only a solution at TL15+ though.
(Side thought - The black globe description mentions that a lot of a jump 
drive\'s mass is in HPGs, which can be used for the black globe\'s energy
buffer - 
perhaps they could be used for a spinal weapon too?)

2/Better Ion drives - Another alternative is using a drive which doesn\'t work

through thermal expansion of a gas. The ion drive presented in FFS is of 
marginal use as a spaceship drive, but what if an improved version became 
available at TL12 or so? An improved version could sacrifice some of the fuel

efficiency for greater thrust, and possibly be run off hydrogen, if the fuel
was 
subjected to high frequency radiation before use to ionise the hydrogen. High

thrust versions might not be \'inhabited planet-friendly\' though, as they
could 
end up like low powered particle accelerators, but it might have a lower 
visibility than HEPlaR

Drives for use in the atmosphere are another problem. Using air instead of
lhyd 
is a good idea, but it wouldn\'t generate as much thrust as hydrogen plasma,
as 
it is harder to heat oxygen/nitrogen. This means that they expand less and so

generate lower thrust. Still, you don\'t need much thrust inside the
atmosphere 
when you\'ve got contra grav. A gentle, planet-friendly drive could give a
push, 
and then the ship (if it was streamlined enough) could just coast gently up 
through the atmosphere, as there\'s no gravity to stop it. On densely
inhabited 
planets, where the high volume of traffic and lack of space around cities
makes 
using HEPlaR too hazardous, spaceports could provide a launch tube to fire 
spacecraft up and away from the planet without them needing to fire their 
engines at all. \'Time to orbit\' is a strange chart, as the G-Turn
expenditures 
on it only apply if the launching craft is trying to reach orbital velocity,
to 
intercept a spacestation or something. If all the ship wants to do is to
reach 
orbital _altitude_, then it could expend much less thrust, and then rely on
its 
contragrav instead of freefall to keep it up from the planet.

And about the fluorine, sorry, I was thinking one thing and writing another -

organic fluorine compounds are stable, but would break up in the high energy 
radiation from a fusion drive.

Comments, suggestions, corrections? (probably :-)

> Impact missiles are dead, dead, dead.  :-) 

Impact missiles are sick and bedridden in standard combat, but you could make
a 
useable one for some situations -

Traders, and battleship fleets on transit, not expecting combat, would
usually 
make insystem burns in a very straight, predictable manner, so as to keep the

transit time as low as possible, and the fuel expenditure likewise as low as 
possible. An undetected ship could launch a missile from a very long way off,

which could accelerate to get a reasonable velocity for impact and
interception 
purposes, and then shut down its engines. It could then raise a miniature
black 
globe (you\'d need to expand the table in defensive systems to include some
much 
smaller generators), and providing it was small enough, the sensor task to 
detect it could be subject to +6 or so difficulty modifiers. This would mean 
that there would be simply no way for a ship to see this missile and avoid it
at 
any range (You may want to allow some chance to see it at very close range,
but 
only enough to shoot it down, not to move out of the way) . However, the
missile 
wouldn\'t be able to maneuver, so this would only work if the position and
path 
of the target was known exactly, so the tactical uses of the missile would be

limited, but still significant. It could be used against:

Orbiting space platforms
Ships in predictable transit
Ships in a fixed air/space traffic control holding pattern
Ships linked to ships allied to the missile craft and so not thrusting
   - Adventure Idea: RCES stretch clipper docks with smallish Guild vessel
for 
diplomatic talks. The clipper is destroyed, while other ships from both sides

look on. Initially a third party should be suspected - no guild personnel had

left their ship, so explosives could not have been planted, none of the guild

vessels (appeared to) fire any weapons. Characters could get involved in 
detective work with the sensor logs, on the guild vessels (finding fire
control 
solutions but no firing records, coded mesages and transmissions to the
asteroid 
belt nearby). Clues from this lead the players to a missle silo hidden in an 
asteroid. Once the guild is found out they have a fight on their hands, but
if 
they win they can at least capture the technology and return it to the RCES. 
There it will be examined, and changes to operating procedures could be made,

introducing randomness into the RCES craft\'s maneuver patterns to protect 
against missile attacks.

This missile can only really be used once against an enemy (once they have 
identified what hit them, and if they survive to spread word), as it is
simple 
to defend against once it is known about. For this reason I haven\'t actually 
designed one, just use it as a plot device.

Some merchant ships don\'t have any lasers at all, so you could use homing
KKMs 
against them. - Anyone want to design a 5MJ socket laser to sell to the
traders?

True, unless you\'re dealing in traveller canon, not reality...  frequently 2

True, but that just changes how they get to the target, not what they do when
they get there.

Agreed, they\'re all crazy propulsion systems.  HEPlaR is a fusion Nerva far
as
I can tell.  If you do the math on HEPlaR, it has to be what FFS calls a
"fusion rocket" regardless (just to give the exhaust the KE it has) :-)

OK, so missiles sigs are higher regardless of type.  If you fix that, then
you
might even be able to get a lock on most of them (assuming they don\'t coast 
into your hex, *then* light up at 12gs when it\'s too late for you to do much.

But you have an absolute limit on the number of shots you can fire in the
canon of TNE (800).  And 5% of tasks *always* fail.  The TNE (and the real,
what
a surprise they match :) universe is an uncertain place.

Try to kill the 15,000 missiles a Tigress could launch using BL.  Hell try
locking on a single missle in BL.  Canon TNE on this is garbage.  If you
can\'t
have contact missiles because it\'s impossible to miss them, then why is it
that
you can\'t even *lock* them a reasonable fraction of the time.  At what point
does the "sneak up within a BL hex" end, and the "it\'s impossible not to 
detect, lock, and shoot down an infinite number of missiles with one, or even
*no* directed energy weapons" begin?

> 
> Impact missiles are dead, dead, dead.  :-) 
 
Nope.  I\'ll grant that missiles might have bigger signatures due to high-
energy exhaust, but as it stands you can\'t hit \'em in the rules too well (and
the rules *are* canon).  Also, det laser missiles go off in the same hex for
the most part.  The less than 3 minutes it takes your 12g missile to get to
the
middle of the hex is 10 shots at a ROF of 100.  How does your laser shoot 100

missiles down when 5% will always miss (task=easy)?  What about my free
trader
that just had its laser shot off by that pirate?  What about that dead
maneuver
drive on the Patrol Cruiser?  Dead powerplant, too.  How does it shoot down
the
easy to kill contact missile?  Oh yeah, my sensors got toasted 15 minutes
ago,
how do I see the missile?

Besides, what if the target isn\'t eavading?  At the point when a det laser
would
fire, the contact missile spreads a big cloud of nasty pellets that will
cross
the certain path of the target with X pellets per kiloliter (this would be
fractional, for sure) such that more or less for every 100tons of target 
displacement there would be 1 pellet.  You\'d have the same chance to shoot it
down that you do for a det-laser.  Now you have 10E6 targets smaller than
your
beam cross section (laser).  Hell, how do you *see* them?  If you do how do
you 
kill them?

Given that contact missiles would, and should work (under the conditions that
*no* defense is perfect, especially one that doesn\'t exist), I agree that the
plasma coming out the back-end would make lock-on easier (or at the least
a bogey detection).

I have a 16 MJ laser for just that purpose.  It does -15 diffmods, and is

Yesterday, I said that you could use a Tukera frieghter to send about
150 colonists to Tarsus from Fornice for "kCr 76700 per colonist".  
I meant to say "Cr 76700, or kCr 77".  

Now, I assumed that Fornice chartered a frieghter at standard rates,
and that it was less than 40 years old so that it still had to pay
off the mortgage.  But what if it doesn\'t?  The mortgage that needed
to be paid during the charter was about kCr 6700.  The charter fee was
about kCr 8500.  Let\'s say that the Imperial government wants to
encourage colonization, and lets old ships reduce the fixed charter
fee by the same amount that they used to pay the bank in mortgage
payments.  The charter fee is then only kCr 1800 or so for the 150
colonists to get from Fornice to Tarsus.  Supplies are still kCr 20
per colonist, or kCr 3000 total.  The start-up fee per colonist just
dropped to a possible minimum of kCr 32 each. 

The reason that you might not want to drop the price that low is 
that you\'ll probably want to spend some money earned by the profitable
old ships to pay off the mortgages on the new ships.  But since they\'ll
be earning money too, you will be able to drop the colonization charter
cost to some degree and still earn a decent profit.  And considering
how long well-maintained ships in the Wilds have lasted in the New
Era, there could be a lot of old ships in operation in the Imperium. 

The more I think about this, the more it seems that the fixed passage
costs "mandated by the Imperial Ministry of Transportation" exist to
keep the megacorporation express-route liners from undercutting the
fares of the small start-up tramp freighters.  Once a company is over
forty years old, it\'s going to start getting some nice profits from
the older freighters.

     I think that Christopher may be right about the planet being fairly
lush, without having to resort to funny chemicals or anything.  It seems to
me (any climatologists out there feel free to correct me) that the amount
of rainfall at a given point on a planets surface would depend on how much
water the winds could carry to that area.

    Mertactor is tiny (about 1/4 the circumference of Terra), but it has
the same atmospheric density as Terra.  You would expect that the winds
would have the same strength and the same water carrying ability as winds
on Terra, so that a point of land at a given distance from the sea would
have the same water content on Terra or on Mertactor.  Add in the effect of
the low gravity (.25G), and you would get winds that moved 4 times the
distance as they would on Terra.  

    The amount of moisture the winds can carry is the other major factor.
The actual area of Mertactor\'s hydrosphere is fairly small, so the winds
would spend less time over the water, but I think that there would be
sufficient time for the atmosphere to absorb it\'s maximum carrying capacity
of water.

    Combine these two circumstances and you would get a world where the
winds carry a load of water equal to that on Terra up to four times the
distance.  The overall lushness of the planet would depend heavily on the
layout of the oceans and mountain ranges.  If the hydrosphere were
concentrated in one or a few compact seas, then areas that were outside of
the reach of the seagoing winds would be common, and you would have
deserts.  Likewise you would have deserts if there were high mountains
blocking the ocean winds (although these would likely have a corresponding
lush area on the oceanward side, as in the Amazon).  If there were a number
of small and medium sized seas and lakes you would probably have fewer
areas that were far enough from the ocean winds to be true desert.  In
either case you would expect fairly extensive areas of semi-desert/
savannah/high plains type areas, where there was a reasonably regular,
albeit meager, rainfall.  I would also expect areas of mediterranean-type
climate, particularly along the leeward coasts of the seas - reasonable
seasonal moisture, but not extending terribly far into the continental
interior.  In all I would think that there would be plenty of large areas
of lush vegetation, quite sufficient for a population of 60 million.  Think
of something like Australia - lush coastal areas, some rainforests, and a
variety of desert and semi-desert outback areas.  A planet is a big place,
even a small one like Mertactor, and there would seem to me unlikely that
it could have one uniform climate.  Mertactor has a total dry land area
about 45% that of Terra - plenty of room for 60 million to find some nice,
habitable areas.

 Well, as the self-appointed Chief Archivist (I came up with the
 concept...), I envisioned RICE as a way of fleshing out areas that
 GDW didn\'t (and probably couldn\'t and shouldn\'t).  My point of
 view is that anything in the RICE papers should be at least
 grossly consistent with The Universe According To GDW.  I
 certainly don\'t see any gross problems with any of the RICE
 material posted to date.

 FWIW, Glisten was me, not Alvin Plummera.  Alvin has, however,
 been the most prolific RICE research associate to date.

Good point - under FFS rules each laser would need a separate crewmember to
fire 
it. A master fire director would probably be uneccesary at the ranges
involved, 
assuming the laser starts firing before the missile has almost closed to 
detonation range. Even though, the extra accommodations for the crew needed
to 
man hundreds of anti missile lasers needed to protect a ship against a
5,000ton+ 
missile carrier would be prohibitive, even on a larger cruiser, and even if
you 
designed the lasers to be really small. How about letting MFDs allow a single

gunner to fire a number of weapons equal to its normal -Diff mods, each
firing 
at a separate target, although without any accuracy benefit from the MFD.

I\'d always wondered how the system where the crew pass on the data from one 
computer to the next computer in line worked to protect systems. If the crew 
could recognise whether the code is right or not, couldn\'t they have just 
generated it themselves with a pocket calculator? This seems to show that the

crew could only spot massive and blatant changes in the codes. Anyway, how 
much can you compress down a jump solution? Sure this protects against
further 
infection, but the virus could still control the actions of the subsidiary 
computers by feeding slightly erroneous codes to the crew. Integrating the 
ship\'s systems should be possible to do safely, as long as the communications

systems are completely isolated.

How about using very small KKMs against detonation missiles? The tracking 
solution should be really easy as the KKM would never need to generate a fire

control solution, as it can home until contact. The detonation missile won\'t
be 
able to shoot down the KKM, and evasion wouldn\'t help much against a high
tech 
tracking system.

Right.

I suppose one might claim that the planet Mertactor wasn\'t colonized by
300, just the Mertactor system. Belters and such, I suppose. Otherwise
my argument goes as follows:

The 300 map shows a dotted line that encloses an area denoted as "settled"
(but not under Imperial control). The line goes right by Mertactor. If
Mertactor had been in the middle of the area, and unsettled, it might have 
been to complicated to show that it was unsettled. But Mertactor is right on 
the edge of the area. If Mertactor had been unsettled (or do I mean \'not 
settled\'? ;-) in 300 then it would have been quite simple to draw the dotted 
line the other way round Mertactor and leave it in the \'not settled\' area. 
Since this was not done, Mertactor must have been settled by 300. The 
argument is strengthed by looking at the year 400 and year 500 maps and note 
that the dotted line does move, presumably to reflect new settlements, and 
to note that the one planet we know about in the area, Tarsus, is outside 
the settled area on the y400 map and inside it on the y500 map, just as it 
should be according to other information.

I objected that exporting people was expensive. You responded that perhaps
Mora didn\'t foot the bill - perhaps the ships came from somewhere else (and
were thus paid by someone else). I responded that if the settlers came from 
somewhere else then Mertactor couldn\'t be said to be settled from _Mora_. 

>But I would like to know your views on my fuel scoops argument. Fuel scoops 
>eliminate the lion\'s share of the costs of interstellar travel.

Ahh! I missed that because I\'ve been using Trillion Credit Squadron economics
for my arguments and they completely ignore fuel costs. No, I\'m not terribly
impressed by the argument. Fuel costs are not the lion\'s share of 
interstellar travel costs. The most impressive is the cost of the ship and
(in TCS) the 10% yearly maintenance cost of same. Even with Book 2 economics
fuel skimming is very uneconomic. The time you loose while skimming cuts 
down on the number of jumps you can make per year but the maintenance costs 
and bank payments remain the same.

Oh, no, not accurate. But it gives us the best evidence we have and it does

True.

Profoundly untrue. Whenever people have done something that didn\'t make
economic sense in the long run they may have managed in the short run,
but they\'ve always been caught in the crash eventually. It\'s like... no
it IS a law of nature: You can keep piling stones on top of each other
for a while, but eventually they\'re going to come tumbling down.

>Pick up a book on any region\'s history and you\'ll find descriptions of

Yes, but those were also funded by someone; someone foolish, perhaps, but
someone with ressources. That\'s not what I object to. My objection is 
that it\'s a government that\'s funding this particular foolishness and
that it\'s not the kind of foolishness governments indulge in. Governments
are far more apt to err through spending too FEW money on a project.

>My world view is that we often do stupid or even crazy things, 

Yes, but never without a reason that seems good at the time. What reason
would the Moran government have for spending all that money to get rid of
these people when they could have gotten rid of them for 1/3rd the cost?

>How about this:  1) I deport the colonists from Fornice or Glisten

Ooops, I\'ve left my Spinward Marches file at home. I can\'t remember if
there\'s ever been any information on when Fornice was settled. Glisten was
settled in 298, so it\'s propably a bit early to feel population pressure.
In fact, it\'s a little early to feel population pressure even on Mora IMO.
However there\'s no reason the settlers can\'t be from Mora. What I doubt is 
that they have been moved there at government expense. Note that it is in
the \'settled, but not Imperial\' area, so it\'s not an official colony of
any Imperial government (since otherwise it would be an Imperial planet
itself). You could keep most of what you wrote by making the settlers Morans
who were wealthy, but persecuted (advocates of patriachy? polygamists? 
garlic fanciers?). That way their move to a spot so far from Mora makes 
sense. As for the date, now that you\'ve moved it that close to 300, could 
you put it a little before 300 to keep the map honest? ;-).

damn stupid things in the short term...

Again, my comment is that *Governments* in particular are the MOST
susceptible
to doing stupid things with money -- after all, it\'s not THEIR money.  Case
in point: any of the Budgets passed by the United States Congress in the last
20-odd years...

I don\'t know, why does the U.S. Government pay massive amounts of taxpayer
money to fail to solve problems that could have been solved for a fraction of
the
cost by private industry or private charity?

Why does the government of India waste tax monies supporting a massive
bureaucracy
that hobbles the Indian economy and guarantees 3rd World status for what
could
be one of the most powerful economies of the Indo-Pacific region?

Repeat above comments for Great Britain prior to Maggie Thatcher\'s reforms,
and
several members of the European Union.  Not to mention Canada (hear you guys 
up there really, really enjoy those national and provincial Value-Added
Taxes, yes?  
Been a real stimulus to the economy, haven\'t they? :-(      )

Have I managed to miss offending anyone yet?  :-)

Face it, Hans, Governments do spectacularly stupid things with tax monies...
All
it takes is someone to get the idea that they gain politically from the
stupid thing
in question, or that he/she/it can line his/her/their own pockets as a
result, and
they\'re off to the Government Budget Follies...

The question to ask about the Mertactor colonization is, "Who profits?"  
Shipowners, for one...

The MT canon was that the energy caught up in the sink of black globes 
wasn\'t good for any use, but now that there is HPG\'s for this, you may even 
power the jumpdrive if you are out of jumpfuel.

Or as you write power the spinal mount and other weapon systems. The 
drawback is that you need someone to shoot at you.

There may even be a feasable way to build transporters this way. Instead of 
spending volume for fueltankage for several parsecs, the craft got only for 
one, but the drive itself are built for J3 or whatever. A blackglobe is 
mounted for "refueling" the jumpdrive HPG. A laser cannon is then providing 
the ship with enough power for a full jump. The problem with this is that it 
will be a risky venture at a frontline, or in areas with more than 1 parsec 
between the systems. The crafts is dependant on a outside source at all 
times to be able to jump far enough.

In  the real world any missile that would approach a starship would be 
detected, regardless of what kind of a drive the missile used. The missile 
can\'t hide in the sea clutter or behind a horizon as real-world(tm) missiles 
do to approach their targets. There are radars today that can detect a grape 
(if it was made of metal) on several hundred kilometers range. A missile 
present a larger cross section than a grape.

Yeah, but if we can detect the missile at medium range, we have several 
turns to shot it down, thus the chance increase.

Easy I wouldn\'t use laser when they get on detonation range, I would use 
repulsors. The mass of the pellets would be too small to get through a 
widebeam repulsor (ok repulsors aren\'t beam weapons, but you may "aim" it in 
general direction) And before the missiles came too close I would use 
anti-missile-missiles. They would certainly hit. When your target goes 
head-on towards you it is only to place the AMM between yourself and the 
treat, and send thousands of pellets against them. The lasers pick of what 
ever they might hit after that, and then we got the third line of defense 
against the pellets, my above mentioned repulsors.


>Given that contact missiles would, and should work (under the conditions that
>*no* defense is perfect, especially one that doesn\'t exist), 
It may work against staionary targets that are not able to defend 
themselves. But a naval ship I would go for the detonation missile. They 
would have far greater success at a target that are able to defend its self. 
And yeas no defense is perfect, not even that I mentioned above, but 3 lines 
of defense are far harder to get through than 1 or two that you are 
presented with when it comes to detonation missiles.

(or at

In my campaign, all targets are always detected, because there are nowhere 
to hide within a mapboard, except planetside or on an asteroid. But you have 
to get a lock-on to identify what you see.

     Sorry for the misplaced credit.  Good paper, though.  I only hope 
     people continue to contribute these things.  I think it\'s a great idea 
     and that the more folks who contribute, the more varied and unusual 
     RICE papers we should get.  The universe in the 57th century (58th?) 
     should be a pretty diverse place.  I\'m sure the diversity of 
     personalities on this board can make it so.

     You see, Hans, where there\'s a will, there\'s a way.  This is what I

     Hmm.  I don\'t see how Glisten, which is more trailing and settled in 
     298, could have been settled _after_ Mertactor.  The colonial push 
     didn\'t come from the Trojan Reaches did it?  I thought all those crazy 
     colonists came through Corridor Sector, which implies to me that they 
     would have probably hit Glisten, Mora, et al _before_ Mertactor.
     
     Therefore, wouldn\'t 305 or even 325 (to give time for population 
     pressure to be felt) be a better date?
     
     Also, I don\'t know if you\'ve been reading the other posts on this 
     little discussion, but a few folks have come up with several 
     interesting methods by which my little colonial kick in the pants 
     might work, even from remote Mora.  Such as the involvement of a third 
     party who is interested in purchasing the ships after the Mertactan 
     colonists are unceremonially dumped on the planet.
     
     I\'d be interested in seeing your opinions before publishing my third, 
     and hopefully _final_ version of Mertactor (sorry, Jeff Zeitlin, I 
     know I\'m making it difficult to archive these things!).
     
     So far, I\'m convinced on the date thing, but I still want the 
     colonists to be poor rejected folks rather than rich reject folks.

OTOH, SJG tends to release new editions much more often - we\'ve had 3
versions of Traveller in 16 years, and about 4 versions of GURPS in half
that time. And I\'ve lost count of the number of versions of Car Wars, (not
to mention the various rule changes in ADQ/Pyramid).

Historical flashback: a posting for Ariikeshmundin subsector, a 
subsector on the coreward fringe of the First Imperium.

[I\'m working with only a limited amount of information on the ancient 
Vilani, please post any historical corrections.  If anyone want\'s to 
continue to develop this area, feel welcome to: I basically built this on 
a lark.  

No, I don\'t have Vilani & Vargr.   Sigh....]

First off, dating.  According to my information, the Vilani built their 
first jump drive in -9235 (3894 PI, 4714 BC), and fought their 
thousand-year Consolation Wars from -5400 (1017 PI, 880 BC).  The actual 
creation of the First Imperium - ie. the first Vilani interstellar state - 
was at -5273 (922 PI, 752 BC): however, it wasn\'t actually considered an 
empire at the time, and didn\'t have any shadow-emperors yet.  At -4045 (
1 VI, 476 AD) the war ended, and the current Vilani dating system began.

[At -8900 (3644 PI, 4380 BC) the Vilani sphere was 10pc in size 
 At -5430 (1040 PI, 910 BC) Jump 2 was discovered. The Vilani sphere was 
    about 60 parsec\'s in radius.]

Now, my subsector is set on -4868 Imperial, after the creation of the 
First Imperium, but before the end of the Consolation wars.  What\'s my 
current dating system?  It can\'t be VI/PI, since the war\'s haven\'t ended 
yet, but the Imperium does exist.  And what\'s the name of this Imperium?  
I don\'t think it\'s The Grand Empire of the Stars, as there is no emperor 
yet.  Moreover, according to the Library Data books, the Vilani contacted 
a large number of nearby races in it\'s initial expansion, without 
conflict: there was already a government regulating trade and technology.

Unless someone with Vilani and Vargr knows different, I have elected to 
call the current government the Stellar Commonwealth.  Vilani 
civilization by this time is c.4400 years old, the Imperium/Commonwealth 
is about 425 years old.  The Consolation Wars are in full swing, being 
fought by the aggressive Vilani to incorporate ALL jump-capable peoples 
into one united government. (the other governemnts obtained jump-tech 
from Vilani traders, etc, although the Genoese to this day claim to have 
invented it on their own.)  Most fighting/"pro-active diplomacy" is 
rimward of Vland, in a massive arc cutting through the following sectors:
   Shaakasi (Verge), Illeish, Zarushagar, Masilaa (Massilia), Manadish 
Khurem (Delphi), Rishunir (Fornast), Makhuniim (Ley).
   Territory actually controlled by the Commonwealth includes Kishadikhu 
(The Windhorn), Meshan, Mendan, Amdukan, Vland, Lishun, Mirasirka 
(Antares), Sushinar (Reft, on the rimward side), Gushemege, Dagudashaag, 
Ukan (Core). Gushgus (The Empty Quarter) is currently uninhabited by any 
interstelar civilization: it won\'t even recieve the name Gushgus for
three centuries.
   Five Vilani megacorporations exist at this time: Makhidkarun 
(entertainment, communications), Naasirka (information, electronics), 
Sharurskid (trade, speculation), Damuumirkhuu (finance, banking), and 
Khiimkeshushisaas (starships, heavy equipment).
   Interstellar government is by a number of ruling councils, allotted by 
the population of a world.  Representatives are chosen by the world in 
any manner it sees fit.  Vilani colonies dominate these councils, and 
most follow the lead of Vland.  Many of the more powerful non-Vilani 
systems have been long-dominated by Vland for millennia, and identify 
with her in the same way the ancient Spanish, for example, would be proud to 
call themselves Romans during the first Solomani Imperium. (well, OK, the 
technology can stand some improvement...)

[As an aside: the Zhodani get jump drive on -5415, The Vargr on -3810, 
the K\'kree at -4142, Hivers at -4698.  The Terrans contact the Vilani at 
-2422, soon after getting jump drive.]

The curremt dating system is an ecletic and convoluted one, where you need a 
computer to keep track of which day it is. Despite it\'s clumsiness, 
Vilani conservativism insists on using it ("It was good enough for the 
ancestors, it\'s good enough for us!") until the end of the Consolation 
wars.  Years are denoted by an name/number combo, ie Urursi-Irika 1871. 
Each day and month are named: however, the names change often to 
commemorate new events, major discoveries, etc. (Imagine if a the name of 
a month was changes everytime a major news event happened, ie renaming 
December Freedom because that\'s whne the Berlin wall fell, or changing 
Wednesday to Sputnik because that\'s when it made it\'s first orbit.)

So much for the time period. (Oh, before I forget: the Max TL is B, but it\'s 
available only in Vland sector at this time.) Now to the subsector.
Our subsector is at the coreward rim of Kishadiku sector: it\'s neighbours 
are noted below 

Amshagi    |  Kishadiku    |  Meshan  |
Eneri      |  Vland        |  Lishun  |  Mikasirka  |

Ariikeshmindin is at Subsector C: basic UWP information follows.
Date:  16D Urursi-Irika 1871

P = Kishadikhu Patrol Base  (mainly customs, rescue, law enforcement)
B = Vilani Naval Base
T = Megacorp Trade Station
L = Local Naval base
* = Trade route. Starships pratically never leave this route: only the 
military and crazy free traders (there about 3 in this subsector) will 
ever do so.
Vi = First Imperium alliegance.  In = Independent

[Note: the above is for referee use only: there is no such thing as "UWP 
listings" for the First Imperium.  The players will have to discover this 
information themselves, and try to remember it without recourse to UWP 
codes of any form.]

Trade:
Pratically all trade within the First Imperium is by convoy, from small, 
5-ship affairs to massive, thousand-ship trader fleets.  This is for a 
variety of reasons: the preference in safety in numbers (Solomani 
individualism is nearly unheard of), insurance costs, and the fact that 
very few ship have built-in fuel purifiers, forcing them to stick to the 
chain of trader bases and starports. (Obtaining a licence for a fuel 
purifier is nearly impossible for civilians)

Because this subsector is so thinly settled (it will only have 2 hi-pop 
systems by -2219, when the First Imperium falls, 2649 years from now), 
there are only about 200 jump-capable merchantmen, almost all built at 
TL 9, on a basic 200-ton frame.  The Commonweath Navy has about 20 
combatants, built on a similar frame, but with a few lasers added.  It 
also has 2 600-ton SDB, both on Ariikeshmundin/2109. 

Politics
Subsectors governments varies widely within the Commonwealth, the most 
common forms being 1 world = 1 vote democracy, established bureaucracies, 
ruling families, appointed govenours, martial law or megacorporate rule, 
a la the British East Indian Company.

Ariikeshmundin subsector is currently rules by an appointed civilian 
governour, a retired naval captain.  Most of his duties revolve around 
mediating disputes between the three Iklikha worlds (Magagaziishii/1806, 
Arshlekuurpe/1807, Shiirushshe/1906); promoting trade and settlement of 
the Shuu Miradis  group (Arrikeshmundin, Ukiishish, Giikikasmir, 
Ashurgamlii); keeping an eye on non-Vilani space, esp. Gakhabalukar; 
insure that the Liipukurkhulii convoys (from 1807 to 2110) run smoothly; and 
(unofficaly) skim a little off the top for himself. 

There is a major war on one of his worlds, Magagaziishii/1806.  However, 
he has resoutely avoided getting involved, as it would be extremely 
expensive.  Moreover, neither of the combatents pose a threat to the 
Commonwealth.  However, public opinion, which long supported him, is now 
urging an intervention: letting this war fester is becoming a liability 
to the system\'s self-image, and the sector government might blackball 
this subsector as "Too barbarian", locking out the subsector from a host 
of goodies like easy terms on loand, or additional funds for developemnt 
projects. 

*The Liipukurkhulii route (to save time, only hex numbers are used)*

The Shuu Miradis worlds
2109 - Capital of the subsector, real ship yards, naval base.  Centre of 
trade for the subsector
2209 - TL A -- best TL for the entire coreward half of the sector. 
Rapidly growing colony, heavy into architecture.  One of the top two 
shipyards in the sector, but only a handful of ships are made per year.  
Wealthest world in the subsector
2110 - Young (founded 40 years ago), growing colony.  Founded as a 
trader\'s stopover, it\'s economy centres around it\'s ship yard, but is 
starting to diversify.  Often prone to boom-bust cycles.
2210 - Ho-hum port.  A run-dwn, economically deprived world.  
Absolutely dependent on it\'s port for all income: a very bad place to be 
during a downturn.

En route to the Iklikha worlds
2107 - A hard religious dictatorship.  Little to trade, just a stopover.  
A waterworld, it\'s orbiting port is owned by the subsector, rahter than a 
corp, line or megacorp.
2108 - A stripped-down refuel depot: barely a port at all!
2106 - Worldwide, TL 1 empire run by massive Brontosaouri 
(well, to Solomani eyes, anyways)  About 30m. long, head raised up to 
18m high, weight about 30 meteric tonnes. 
Hits - 100, Hooves - 5, Tail - 4, Stomp 15
Armour 3, Initiative 1.  To hit: 8.   9A, 7F, 29S 
2105 - An expensive overhaul and transshipping point.  Ships which have 
emptied a LOT of their cargo for fuel and/or loaded up on fuel pods can 
try to make the journey to Gakhabalukar/2104, the most powerful non-Vilani 
system in the subsector.  No Gakhabalukar jumpships visit: the 
Vilani is extremely jealous of jump technology, and forced the 
Gakhablukar to give up building or maintaining any jumpships.

The Iklikha Worlds
1906 - A highly interesting world.  Rigid, but popular laws.  One of the 
few Vilani colonies where science and research is actually tolerated.
1806 - Hot sopt of the subsector: currently in the throes of a on-again, 
off-again world war.  The few nuclear warheads the world could afford 
have already been used, and they are continually trying to save enough 
money to buy more, while fending off the enemy in the meantime. 
They are avid buyers of conventional military equipment, too.  Traders can 
often be seen in orbit, waiting for a truce so they can land in neutral 
territory.
  As the two fractions improvish each other, a steady stream of refugees 
is emigrating from the system, and the subsector governour is starting to 
feel pressure from Upstairs to solve the situation: rather difficult, 
given the limited amount of force he can bring to bear against the two 
fractions, but becoming more viable as the world ruin\'s it\'s capasity to 
fight off even a shoestring invasion. 
1807 - A highly alien and dangerous enviroment: ships must plot their 
decent carefully, or be suddenly ripped apart/broiled alive in atmosphere. 
Sole source of a variety of rare ores and alloys for the sector quadrant 
(subsector\'s C,D,G,H)  Wealthiest of the Iklikha worlds now that 
Magagaziishii/1806 has ruined itself.

Outside of the Liipukhulii route: trailing

- a region of general poverty, and few ports.  Home of the stagnating 
Kidu Shazahud region.

The Kidu Shazahud region proper
2207 - No port: balklanized in very small settlements of 1,000 - 10,000.  
Loathe\'s visitors.  Endless skirmishing.
2305 - Four large nationsn c.110 small nations.  No port: has little of 
value to trade
2306 - No port: home of a small,struggling colony. Grim prospects.
2307 - Once a massive Vilani naval base, built 500 years ago as a staging 
areafor a stillborn attempt to expand coreward of Kishadiku sector.  Now, 
theorbiting portion has long crashed, while the ground portion has 
suffered major technological regression.
2308 - Originally a scientific research station, now a rarely-visited 
philosophical monastery.  No port.
2406 - Gateway to Sudarri subsector (Kishadikhu-D) (a very sparcely settled 
area: c. 24 million total popualtion). Cultural, economic links are to that 
subsector, not here.

Outside of the Kidu Shazakud region:
2409 - A provately owned port (and system!) of a system-wide corporation.
2410 - No port. Economically bankrupt, but politically stable.

Outside of the Liipukurkulii route: Spinward
1706 - A simple but efficent port. A small surveying settlement, run by 
the subsector government.
1808 - A "flat pavement" port.  With a fuel farm.
1909 - a Health retreat, with an oversized port to handle the additional 
passanger traffic.  Many subsector-wide sporting events are held here.
2010 - No port: for centuries (up to today) a favourate exile world for 
political dissidents.  Directly controlled by the subsector.

[Note: 1908 is a system which is uninhabitable despite it\'s breathable 
air and biosphere, due to subvocal soundwaves that render the non-deaf 
insane over one to two weeks.]

Outside the Liipukurkulii route: Coreward
1804 - The masters of this decrepid port have manages to organize the 
original, now TL 0 settlers as "employees".
2002 - With a small but viable port, this habitable world is the most 
sfaest, pleasent place in the subsector.
2103 - Just another orbiting refuel centre.
2104 - A very fine port: no new jumpship construction ability, due to a 
treaty with the Commonwealth.  Wealthy, old, well defended - but 
emasculated, unable to expand across the stars due to the shadow of 
Commonwealth fleets.  Can\'t seem to decide to hate or emulate the Vilani.
2201 - A poor port, maintained for prestige rather than use. A 
poor, but comapatively pleasent, culture.
2302 - Formerly a large Gakhabalukar colony. Brutally nuked by the Vilani 
to "persuade"  Gakhabalukar/2104 to give up interstellar expansion or 
exploration.
