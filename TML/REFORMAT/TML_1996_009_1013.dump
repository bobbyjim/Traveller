Right...you know when I responded...not when I first read the message.  I 
may have read the message I was responding to right after it was sent

Read "Down In Front Cleon."  Survival Margin page 76.  The basic premise 
is that in the Imperium the "Sentient Creature" us a pretty hyporcitical 
thing.  The Imperium would never recognize the Cymbline chips as members 
of the Imperium because they, like the sentient robots, could be 
conveniently excluded and exploited for the "greater good of man kind."

I brought up this argument once to my GM after I figured out that the 
chips were sentient.  He gave me this article and a couple of others from 
Survival Margin to read.  I had a much lower opinion of the Imperial way 
of life after reading them.

BTW folks, I checked into prices for Corel and Visio...and choked!
Coreldraw 5 & 6\'s MSRP is $695, and Visio\'s MSRP is $249!  I only pay
that kind of money for things I\'d use in my job...actually I\'d try to
get the college to buy them.  <g> I can\'t see paying hundred\'s of
dollars for something I could do on graphpaper and then *scan* into
the computer.

>Are there any other drawing program formats that poeple are using?

I picked up a really inexpensive program called Floorplan Plus
($3.95...I really mean cheap!  <g>), Saturday and installed it.  I\'m
new to this sort of on-screen drawing, but it looks like it might be
able to do deckplans, and I *know* it\'ll be able to do floorplans <g>
for gaming purposes.  It comes with over a hundred placable objects,
and has a section in the manual on how to build your own.  I *don\'t*
think it\'ll print a grid which is a problem, but one I could get
around.

FP is a vector based program, and its native format is propriatary,
but it will export to EPS (encapsulated postscript) and DXF (data
exchange format). 

My questions has to do with EPS and DXF.  I\'m really not familar with
either format, what commonly available programs can display them? 

If I uuencode and send an EPS or DXF file to players in my PBEM are
they going to be able to view the results?  

I know they could handle raster formats like PCX or BMP, so are there
freeware/shareware/cheap programs that can convert EPS/DXF to raster?

True - they train to do it because you can never be certain to get a chance
at the center of mass.  Military snipers will aim for the center of the body
when possible but take a head shot if necessary (like taking out an OP).
Police snipers operate at much closer ranges and need the head shot to
prevent the target from doing anything after being hit (like shoot the hostages)

Yes they do - it has been type accepted as the M82A1 (a few small

Yes - a beautiful rifle but it weighs too much to carry anywhere.

Don\'t insult Uncle Jesse like that!  <g> He wus jest a good ol\' boy!

More like Boss Hogg, is Jesse Helms.  A former radio/tv commentator,
current US Senator, luddite, prig, and royal pain!  

Ok seriously, Senator Helms was one of the guys behind the CDA that
has everybody so angry down here.  He\'s well liked by certain groups,
like book-burners...and for some strange reason the voters of North
Carolina.

Of course, this is all my opinion...<g>,

Sorry to cut out on you like this Derek, but I think I have to side with the
ANIT-VIRUS crew on this one.  I don\'t see it as being possible that Virus
can be transported as anything other than code.  The code that virus
transmits would be a program that modifies the Deyo Chip that actually
"creates" the Virus in the receiving ship.  I don\'t think sensors can "pick
up" Virus and infect a ship

See above.  This information (Ping) is just data.  It can\'t make the
computer do anything.

According to SM, this never happened.  See Below

Virus used three main porst of entry: Physical contact, Transponder, and
Routine Computer controlled communications.  Virus wasn\'t patient enough to
wait around for the time it would take to infect through sensors, so it just
executed plan number two: "If I can\'t have it no one else will either!"
(Plan number one being: "I want this starship/starport/computer/whatever!")

I would have a hard time buying this possibility because of the whole
data/code issue.  BTW, Virus was only able to parasitize chips at a very
short distance IIRC.  The primary means of infection was to "convince the
Deyo chip to alter its own circuitry."  This is how Virus evolved.  If all
it did was chew up old silicon and "poop" out a chip just like itself, would
it have evolved like it did? No, I think not.  Instead, Virus convinced the
Deyo chip to alter its own circuitry thus creating a new being, not just a
clone or copy of the original.

 An obscure reference which nobody had a clue about.  This is, as
 near as I can tell, the first symptom of the disease that proved
 to be rampant in the creation of _Hivers_and_Ithklur_.

 It also shows just how complete Imperial libraries (including the

 they have had obscure references to Harry Bellafonte and Banana
 Boats?

The expected value of 1d6 is 3.5, so...

...2d6+6 has an ev of 2(3.5)+6 = 13, and a range of 8 to 18

...4d6 has an ex of 4(3.5) = 14, and a range of 4 to 24 (I know that
wasn\'t what you asked, but I included it anyway. <g>)

Now for your second method.

...4d6 (drop lowest roll) 

I don\'t know the statistical function, off the top of my head, but
*logically* it would go like this.  You have a 2d6 + [the better of 2
1d6\'s].  The 2d6 gives you an ev of 7.  The *best* the better of 2
1d6\'s could give you is 6, and that would only be (1/6 + (5/6)(1/6))
of the time..I think.  So the ev would have to be 13 OR LESS.  You\'ll
get the ev of 13 only ~30% of the time, and less than that the rest of
the time.

So, I\'ll guess, take 2d6+6.

Ok math majors, how badly did I screw it up? <G>

Are you sure?  I thought Savannah was listed as a cargo/supply ship,
not a passenger liner.  Was Savannah *ever* in truly private hands, or
wasn\'t it always under the control of the AEC?  IAC, it proved to be
non-viable economicly, didn\'t it?

This is already SOP on (US flag) commercial vessels.  They need a USCG
certified chief engineer aboard (last time I checked it was a 10+ year
ordeal to gain than rank----most of that being a requisite number of
working hours in an engineering capacity).

Which gets me wondering why the Imperium doesn\'t have something like the
Coast Guard which (with its force of 37,000 currently) does ALL the
boarding of vessels for anything other than military take overs.  I\'m in a
class with a guy who was a CPO on a sub in the Gulf Conflict, and they
needed a Coast Guard Liason officer to board ship, because the Coast Guard
official had the authority to do so.

There is no way the Imperial Navy would let itself get tied up in the
patrolling of commercial vessels, so where is the Imperial "Coast Guard".
This would solve all the fission reactor, HEPLaR, etc. regulation
problems...AND they would also cover most of the anti-piracy role, as well
as rescue ops...

Have you seen the pictures of the Legionaires in Bosnia, etc?!  They make
all the Marines I\'ve ever seen look like puppy dogs...And that\'s nothing
against the Marines, its just that the Legionaires are some tough nuts.

Has there ever been any thought given to using heavier elements to power
fusion reactors?  Using Carbon, for instance, would require a hell of a
lot more containment, but would the increased power gains make it worth
it?

For someone in the know..I recall reading that a shot above the eyebrows
will result in immediate muscle tension (i.e. shot the target, he shoots
the hostage/presses that little button--BANG,etc.), and anything along the
plane of the eyes will cause the muscles to relax immediately...?

   Being a former Navy guy myself, I don\'t have a terribly high opinion
   of jarheads either. :)

   I guess I should clarify. I meant it doesn\'t *necessarily* mean that
   marines are elite. I decine to get into the debate of exactly how
   elite any given service is. <g>

:   In point of fact, services around the world do consider the U.S.
:Marine infantry to be a cut above your standard Army infantry, on a par
:with the elite 82nd or 101st Airborne divisions of the U.S. Army.  Their

   Don\'t disagree at all, but note that the 101st is an _Army_ unit. You
   see my point?

   Note that quite a bit of the difference in defining how Marines are
   elite is based on the type of *mission* they get, so different mission,
   different training and organization. Really the biggest difference
   between Marines and Army *is* their mission - it just so happens the
   Marines have a long-standing and proud tradition of training and "win
   or die" attitude, which goes a LONG way towards a great fighting force.

:armor units are lacking however (most of them still have M-60A3 tanks,
:and what M-A1s they have were stolen/requisitioned from the Army),
:and their artillery support relies heavily on supplementation from the Navy
:in the form of off-shore bombardment, and their own aircraft (the Harrier,
:F/A-18, SuperCobra, etc.).

   I thought 1st division was all M1A1\'s?

:  In TRAVELLER terms (because I know sombody is going to complain
:if I don\'t), Marines could have a variety of roles, depending upon the
:basic philosophy of the armed forces using them.

   That\'s one of the reasons I brought this up. After the planetary
   assault commentary that flew back and forth here for a while, and
   then seeing a newsgroup post clarifying the Marine vs. Army mission,
   something clicked and my brain started whirring about Imperial marines.

:   The Imperium used its Marines as ship\'s troops and as kind of a SWAT
:team/peace keeping force, called out when the locals started getting a
:little too violent with each other.   Imperial Marines are elite--in the same
:manner that U.S. Marines are.  They strike with overwhelming force,
:secure the objectives, and then move on when so ordered.  Their tactics
:emphasize mobility and shock over battles of attrition.  While Marine
:garrisons are set up on a long term basis (like the one on Terra), such
:garrisons serve merely as bases of operations or are for show--in
:general Marine units do not spend too much time in one place, long
:term occupation duties usually going to the Army.

   That\'s one thing I started thinking about. Does the Imperium even
   have any kind of standing army, other than planetary services?

   My guess would be no, given that the Imperium is very standoffish,
   and intervenes only in extreme cases. After a "police action", the
   impies would pull out leaving the cleanup to locals. There also
   doesn\'t seem to be an Imperial Army in char-gen, Planetary Armies
   are emphasized.

   OTOH, there\'s the question of wartime activities against "nations"
   like the Zhodani, _some_ kind of Army support would be necessary.
   Does the Imperium siphon off Army support from planetary garrisons
   in time of need?

I think it was a totally wasted youth based solely on the three essentials
of the highest level of Karma attainable!

        1.  Junk Food (Includes Junk Drink for those purists in the audience)
        2.  Too much TV (Including way to many reruns of F-Troop)
        3.  Mucho excessive time playing Computer games and RPG\'s.

I think I wa only weeks away from that highest level of Karma when my wife
met me and bullied me into the semi-responsible person I am today.  :)

Geez, I didn\'t want to start a war.  Couldn\'t we avoid this if I just 
proclaim you Wizard of Mathematics All Supreme?  No?  [sigh] :)

Well, doing a quick and sloppy calculation, it looks to me like 2D6+6 
would be the preferred method.

Again, I used sloppy and quick calculations, but it looks like the 
average roll for 2D6+6 would be 13, while the other method would generate 
an average roll of something in the range of 11-12.

What\'s the correct answer?

        Well, there you go. Cut & Paste to another program that DOES support
something like WMF, EPS or DXF as being (hopefully) the most "common"
formats. And a screen capture will work for GIFs!

My preference has always been the British model:

HMS: His(Her) Majesty\'s Ship; I know the British and German forms did not
stick in any "Imperial" adjective (I think the Imperial German abbreviation
was SMS, anyone know the Imperial Russian offhand?)

Ships from subject nations not under direct control (sector forces, perhaps)
would add the owner: HMRS - His Majesty\'s Reginan Ship

Recognized foreign kingdoms would be abbreviated with the nationality: HNMS
- - His Norwegan Majesty\'s Ship.

Again, I think I deviate from canon here, but I see this as a "flavour to
taste" sort of thing: and I and most of my players have been Her Majesty\'s
subjects anyway.

    'body' => 'I\'ve had several thoughts while reading more of the TNE manual.  Since 
they can each be stated in a relatively few lines, I thought it best to 
make an omnibus post rather than many small ones.

Here they are:

1)  If I\'d bought TNE when it came out, I probably would have ended up 
sticking with the Spinward Marches (AKA The Regency) as my campaign 
location.  I don\'t think I would have used the mass destruction/starting 
to rebuild scenario that is so much more emphasized in the rest of the 
former Imperium.  

2)  That said, I thought of an adventure that seems like it\'d be fun for 
the RC/Wilds location.  A planet is contacted which has fallen back to 
about TL 7-8 in the most populous areas (lower elsewhere, of course).  
There is a large and growing democratic nation on the planet, and it is 
about to hold elections.  The faction currently in power is in favor of 
isolationism and technological stagnation (and is trying to wield its 
power in such a way as to make itself into  a TED - perhaps by use of some 
artifacts they\'ve found and cached, unbeknownst to the populace at 
large).  A much smaller faction, generally in disfavor with the 
population at large (mostly thanks to disinformation and smear campaigns 
by the majority faction), has a philosophy of working toward higher 
technology and eventual re-contact with neighboring worlds (ie, an 
attitude not unlike the RC in its Dawn League period).  Agents from the 
RC (the player characters) are dispatched to covertly assist the minority 
faction in winning the election and consolidating power.  
	I see this playing out in a relatively non-violent manner.  At 
least, that\'s how I\'d slant it if I were running that adventure.

3)   As some have noted, the sidelight quotes /are/ well-written.  It\'s a 
good way to present the flavor of the setting.

4)  Is it just me, or does it seem that a lot of skills were lost in only 
70 years?  The book talks about societies that are comprised of people 
unable to read and write.  Literacy is that easy to loose?  Hmmm.


That\'s it for now.

Yeah, it is stated.  Read the side bar in Survival Margin pg. 71.  All of
the above information comes straight from the "horses mouth."  The side bar
is a transcript of an interview with Imperial Research Station Omicron\'s Dr.
Jamys Jarrah.  (Gosh, I wish I new this many facts about important stuff)

OK, I know I\'m gonna get the royal flame treatment for this, but I got a
good laugh out of Sneaks and Geeks.  I, for one (and from what I\'ve seen
only one), was glad to have a bit of humor thrown into all the facts!

You have a touching faith in humaniti.  People can be surprisingly
dumb even when their pink bods are at stake.  Short-cuts get taken
in maintenance (even with aircraft owned by large airlines), pilots
make mistakes, do things they shouldn\'t.  I should imagine that most
airlines drug test their pilots.  Why would they do that?  Surely the
pilots would be so conscious of their own safety that they wouldn\'t
dream of taking anything that might affect their performance?  It
seems not.  One would hope in an ideal world that the captains of
supertankers filled with oil would not be alcoholics who would
attempt to command the ship when drunk as a lord.  The Exxon
Valdez disaster proves that this is not an ideal world.  The
weakest point of most technology is the people using it, and this
is one thing that I cannot see changing even 3000 years on.

Safety measures will, I\'m sure be much improved, but I\'d be
reluctant to make everything foolproof - it\'d make for less
exciting role playing.  The Traveller rules on starship
maintenance seem to indicate that even in the Far Future,
systems still need to be carefully looked after.

I didn\'t know this (mind you, that\'s not surprising.  I\'m no physicist, this 

idea of the earth going round the sun  is too much for me), and it really
cuts into what I was thinking about, which was a scenario where a ship
crashes in the environs of a city and scatters radioactive debris over
everyone\'s vegetable gardens.  If this would be as much of a potential
danger with fusion powered ships, then there would be no cause for
authorities to single out fission powered ships form particular scrutiny.
Ho hum.

Ironically enough, every so often, nuclear waste :-)

Yes, perhaps.  That and the fact that Legionaires are all essentially
special forces type troops.  I\'s *still* like to see Force Recon go up
against them on that course 8->

No doubt that the legionaires are among the best their is though.

The 4d6 dropping the lowest is a pain to calculate so I took the easy
way out and wrote a little program to roll some virtual dice 10,000
times. There are two bar charts available showing the results at

http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~pickford/traveller/dice.html

the methods are pretty similar, but the 4d6 dropping the lowest is
slightly poorer in that you can still get very low rolls. The averages
over the 10,000 rolls are very similar: 12.9855 for 2d6+6 and 12.2156 
for 4d6 drop the lowest.

Through the radar dish?  You mean, like, a SENSOR?  That darn "Survival 
Margin" book that I\'ve been waving around like it\'s a trick I\'ve learned 
says that such a silly thing cannot happen.  It also makes quite clear 
that a TL-6 agro-world\'s D spaceport traffic control computer is hardly a 
viable host for an active virus, although it could end up having an \'egg\' 
burnt into it if linked (via radio, land line, or having some nasty piece 
of machinery just stomp up and plug into it) to an \'infected\' system for 
any length of time.  Come to think of it, is it unreasonable to expect 
that a starport\'s traffic control system might include equipment for 
querying those tricky Deyo transponder suites?

Did I forget anything else?

I tried again to make sure, Visio does not have hardly any options under
the "Save As" command, only three forms that Visio itself uses.  I tried
highlighting the whole thing and Copy\'d and Paste\'d it into Paitbrush (the
only other drawing program I have at the moment) somewhat successfully.
Somewhat because Paintbrush took only a portion of the original.  I will
try to tweak it after my Holiday (American Independence Day tomorrow, for
all you far\'ners out there), but the copy and paste thing is
encouracging.  If I only had another "real" Windows drawing program I\'d be
all set.  

If I captured the whole drawing window that might work, I remember lview
being shareware right?  I\'ll go look for it.

I\'m not sure that there is any distinction made about armor values using 
the CT design system.  It didn\'t really become a factor (heh) until High 
Guard came out.  Of course, I could just be Dead Wrong...

As far as comparing MT and TNE (FF&S) armor values, I\'m gonna have to do 
some more head scratching, because I only dimly remember how space combat 
went in MT.

Basically, in TNE, if you\'ve got any armor factor over 70, you\'re doing 
okay.  If the TL*50 rule is followed as regards to laser discharge 
energy, then no laser manufactured at TL-15 or below will penetrate it 
(although nuke detonation lasers can).  I may be off by a few factors, 
but there is a point near 70 where the only thing you\'ll suffer is damage 
to your surface fixtures (which isn\'t necessarily inconsequential).  Any 
armor factor over 100 probably puts you in the One Bad Dude category, 
until you remember than particle accelerators often come in sizes large 
enough to punch through such a skin.  In fact, many capital ships will 
carry spinal mounts (PAWS or MG) that\'ll have a damage factor somewhere 
in the hundreds.

This answer probably sheds more heat than light, because many factors are 
not taken into consideration, such as other defensive systems 
(sandcasters, meson screens, etc.).  In other words, it\'s probably not a 
good idea to arbitrarily rate ships depending on their armor factor.  As 
I recall, most system defense boats have mind-bogglingly high armor 
factors relative to other ships their size simply because, not lugging 
around a jump drive, they can carry lots of extra stuff.  Still, you 
wouldn\'t go about calling a 400-ton Dragon SDB a battleship just because 
it had an armor factor in the 90-120 range, would you?

Darnit!  After all that, I still didn\'t provide a meaningful comparison 
between MT and TNE armor values.  I need to be slapped...
 
> BTW, who is "Jesse Helms"?  Any relation to Uncle Jesse from Dukes of

It\'s possible.  I believe the quote (shamelessly lifted from Bill 
Griffith\'s "Zippy" comic strip) refers to the honorable Republican 
senator from ... oh, heck, I forget -- some state south of the 
Manson-Nixon line (North Carolina?).  He\'s also notably for being/having 
been the chairman for the National Endowment for the Arts during the time 
when they wanted to sponsor all of those nasty Mapplethorpe exhibits.  
Kinda like having a pit bull in charge of the chicken coop (which is 
somewhat better than putting a fox in charge of it).

Besides, any one who knew of their true nature, and had the authority to 
publicly admit it and therefore guarantee their protection, would have 
rather gnawed on rusty razor wire than do so.  If word had ever gotten 
out, it\'s certain that more than a few lawyers (either paid by people 
who\'d like to see the transponder system defeated, or pro bono) would 
petition for the little Deyo chips to receive their full citizenship 
rights and be freed from an existence which forced them to have thermite 
charges permanently wired to their little foreheads.

Oh, right!  First, it starts out with something innocent like burning 
books, and then the next thing you\'ll know they\'ll be arguing about who

Okay I won\'t argue with you on active sensors.  It\'s just way to 
difficult an there are easier ways to infect a starship.  But if Virus 
can infect a ship through radio communications.  Remember in the New Era 
all Communication systems are seperate systems not in anyway connected to 
the computers, why could Virus not infect via passive sensors?  All 
passive EMS is, is a really sophisticated radio system.  In fact if you 
think about it this is probably how the initial infection occurred.

Dulinors strike team, breaks into the facility and beams the info out to 
Dulinor\'s ship.  Assume the Strike team is using the cheapest radio 
system available, why?  No one know\'s who\'s going to survive the battle 
so get the info to as many ships as possible.  They beam this info out on 
a broad band transmission.  What are the odds that all of Lucan\'s and 
Dulinor\'s ships are listening to the same radio frequency?  Unless it\'s 
top 40 I\'d say the odds are slim and none, and slim just left town.  

	According to the tome "they began spewing high-speed data 
transmissions which were picked up by several of Dulinor\'s ships as well 
as Lucan\'s."  Okay let me revise what i\'ve just said in light of this new 
evidence.  Tight Beam Transmissions, only picked up by ships in a certian 
area of the sky.  But again what are the odds given the vastness of the 
radio spectrum that both Dulinor and Lucan\'s men were listening to the 
same radio frequency?  If I though they were good I\'d run out and start 
buying lotto tickets now.  So how did Lucan\'s ships get initally 
infected?  Passive EMS, it\'s the only plausable explanation.

I agree with you for 90% of the Virus infections out there, but it is 
clearly evident from the passages in "Survival Margin" that the initial 
infection of Lucan\'s and Dulinor\'s starships did not involve the standard 
starship transponder unit.  They involved radio communication.

All it takes is one generation.  And when that generation\'s primary 
concern is trying to stay alive in a hostile envrionment and trying to 
figure out how to plant and grow crops, something most Imperials haven\'t 
done for a 1000 years, I can see how literacy would become something of a

Only if you read your map upside down.  Try that, it makes the planet 
look really strange.  We\'re so used to north being up it takes our brain 
a few seconds to figure out whats going on.  There\'s another really neat 
map where someone reversed the topographical features, land became sea 
and vice-versa, that\'s pretty wierd to look at too.

Whoops.  Looks like we\'ve been hit with the "Virus = Data" thing, with a 
side order of "Virus = Program."  Although FF&S says that, in a pinch, a 
passive EMS system could be rigged to act as a radio receive, this is not 
its default operating mode.  If you broadcast the Junkie MBR virus (to 
cite a contemporary example) over a digital radio link and a passive EMS 
picks it up, it doesn\'t go "Oh, hey, let\'s download this incoming radio 
transmission."  It merely notes the bearing (and, given time to build up 
a target track, distance) to a source that is emitting EM radiation in 
the radio wave spectrum.  Receiving, demodulating, and decoding that 
emission is nominally the job of the ship\'s communications suite (which 
was typically all too happy to lock in the signal and eventually get 
kaboshed by the Virus-infected equipment effecting the transmission).  In 
"Survival Margin" it is admitted that it is slightly conceivable that a 
Virus infection may have been transmitted by modulating an EM source 
until a receiving EMS sensor was affected, but also states that such an 
infection had never occurred.

This is probably the paradigm you should be using when considering 
Virus.  It does no good to consider Virus to be a wierd chunk of data or 
a malicious program, because it is neither of these things.  Any 
Virus-infected computing device of sufficient power becomes your meddling 
eight-year-old nephew or younger brother, who will attempt to gain access 
to your computer and play hob with it while you\'re not looking, until 
such time as he\'s gained complete control of it and everything hooked up 
to it, at which time he uses it to massacre you, your entire family, and 
anyone else who happens to be around.  When any other explanation or 
hand-waving falls short, I prefer to use the above "Virus = Death Monkey" 
paradigm.

Now, if it\'s to a Virus-infected computer\'s advantage to use a wierd 
chunk of data, or cook up a malicious program, it\'ll probably do so.

It\'s very true that the priorities shift in that situation.  Plus, the 
mortality rate would be worse, so those who had been trained to read 
prior to the collapse would be mostly dead after 70 years.  I guess 
I didn\'t think it through.

Yes - it is only in the movies where someone will take a shot at someone
holding a gun at the head of a hostage because of the problem of muscle
tension (and any good terrorist will have a deadman switch on the
explosives).  A sniper (or more usually in a hostage situation a team of
snipers) will wait until the target(s) relax before engaging.  Snipers have
waited for days to get the "right" shot.

Quite all right.  Just don\'t let it happen again or I\'ll be forced to 
drop a rock on your head.  8)

Seriously, its just something that all of us on the Internet take for 
granted, Literacy.  Remember even today there\'s a huge chunk of the 
earth\'s populace that are totally illiterate (and then there\'s the rest 
of us who can\'t spell worth shit so we may as well be illiterate 8)   ). 
 Imagine how much the mortality rate would have climbed during the 
collapse, it\'s a pretty staggering thought.

Well, yeah, that\'s off. at TL15 you get a 750MJ laser.  That does

You\'ll want some more to do internals.  It\'ll still critical hit a small

No Battleships should have FFS/BL AVs of between 2000 (light) and 4000

Sorry, you\'re right.  The code and data instances above should actually be
something along the lines of discussion when referring to the other Deyo
chips.  Survival Margin states that Virus convinces the Deyo chip to alter
it\'s ofn circuitry, so I guess rather than code it should be referred to as
communication.  However, in the case of Virus infecting through radio (or
any other means of communication) I think it would be more like a program.
My take on this is that Virus immitates the Deyo chip (something it can do
that humans can\'t) in order to convince the ship\'s systems to listen to it,
and then transmits a program (in the guise of a landing program, or docking
program, or just a navigational program) that is loaded and runs(executes).
The program really tells the computer to perform certain commands that
eifther alter the Deyo curcuit or it\'s own curcuits that then become the
receiving ground for Virus.

Yes, this is a bunch of hand waving, but do we really understand what makes
a zygote begin to grow and prevents the sperm and egg from growing?  Without
getting into eternal debates over abortion, do we really know what makes a
zygote (or new born baby) a living being.  How are these things possible?
We are talking about the reproduction of a living being.  We know that our
reproductive system works, and we can give pretty good explanations of how
they work, but we can\'t tell why they work the way they do.  Why should we
be able to tell this about Virus?

I would guess that they were most of them were scanning the radio
frequencies to find anything pertinent.  When the data transmission was
begun, I\'d immagine that many of the ships found that data, but in reality,
all it would take is one, as most of the fleet would share the battle data
after they had jumped.  When virus was dumped, it got on all of them who
were listening.  I doubt Dulinor\'s strike team bothered to encode the data,
they were in a bit of a hurry as I recall.  ;)

This radio/comm unit transfer would be (IMHO) the main method of entry in
the RC as well.  I doubt the RC still uses the Deyo transponder!  (Shame,
shame if they do!)  So all New Era infections would either be through
physical contact or communications!  Now I\'m beginning to see the trouble
the Anti-Virus side has with this concept.  I still will keep the Virus as
long as its part of that C word we all love to hate.

Actually, Sen. Bob ("I\'ve never used a computer") Exon, Democrat from
Nebraska, was the brains (?) behind the CDA.  Jesse is another sort
entirely.....

Jesse Helms would strip the basic protection of law from homosexuals.  He
believes that the United States is a Christian nation, and that no other
religion has any place here.  He advocated a nuclear first strike against
the Soviet Union.  He comes from a tobacco state, and has been the leader in
keeping this cancer causing killer on store shelves.

When I first found out I had cancer, I put together a list of the people I\'d
like to take with me.  Jesse Helms was second on the list, right behind Rep.
Bob Dornan, who is like Helms, only *worse*.

    'body' => 'To bring the discussion back to Traveller, let\'s examine what roles the two
ground pounder services would play in the Third Imperium.

A quick disclaimer.. I\'ve based most of my work around the British forces of
the Victorian period.  The similarities are marked (far-flung colonies
months from the seat of government, huge Navy), and makes my job a little
easier.

The Planetary Defense Force:

Each world of the Imperium is responsible for providing for the defense of
its surface and near-orbit.  Depending on a planet\'s placement and needs,
this may range from hundreds of divisions trained to a razor\'s edge to a
handful of show battalions, more suited to showy "changing of the guard"
ceremonies.  Some LowPop worlds may simply contract with mercenaries to
provide training for a militia type force.

The Subsector Army:

Each subsector in the Imperium raises a permanent force of ground troops.
These are generally equipped to the highest tech level found in the
subsector, or in a nearby area.  Each world provides a number of
regitmental-sized units, based on the population.  By the 1100s, many of
these Regiments have long histories and traditions.  Entry into some units
are so sought after as to cause duels between young officers seeking platoon
leader slots.  (The 4th Jewel Rifles, "The King\'s Guardsmen", date back to
the settlement of the planet.. each vacancy in the regiment brings hundreds
of hopefuls forward.)

The Subsector Army equips and trains based on the perceived threat to the
safety of the subsector.  The Regina subsector makes sure that its equipment
includes psi shields, for example, an addition that makes no sense to a unit
on the Solomani line.

Subsector forces are considered Imperial.  The proper name is "Imperial
Army, (subsector name)".  Large units are organized on an as-needed basis.
Divisions, Corps, and even Field Armies will be brought together only for
large scale training or actual operations.

This structure has the strengths of tradition and being able to select only
the best for service.  Weaknesses include regimental snobbery, and a shaking
out period whenever large units are brought into being.

The Sector Command:

Normally the highest level of Army authority, the Sector High Command
oversees the Army for the entire sector.  It controls no actual force, but
instead holds the purse strings.  SHC also sets the standards for training
and doctrine.

SHC is sometimes referred to as the "Officer Back Shelf", since many
officers unable to find posistions sutible for their rank in their Regiment
come to SHC\'s huge pool of staff officers to wait for a command.

The Naval Infantry Force, aka the Marines:

The only true Imperial ground force, the Marines are tasked, as part of the
Navy, to keep the Imperial peace.  Marine Regiments may be scattered in
platoon strength formations throughout a subsector, but when brought
together represent an almost unstoppable military machine.

The NIF gets the best of everything available; battledress, fusion weapons,
battle robots, etc.  The Marines always are on the cutting edge of Imperial
technology, some Marine raids have even included experimental tech being
sent on its "smoke test".

The NIF, in theory, assigns one Regiment per Regular Fleet.  In practice,
the frontiers tend to get more of the crack regiments, leaving the "lesser"
(in Marine eyes!) groups to patrol the Core.  NIF Regiments are self
contained, and get support from the Fleet to which they are assigned.  The
Marine Regiment is *not* under command of either the Subsector Marshal or SHC.

Well, that\'s my view.. your comments will be met by falling, Virus-infected
rocks looking to set up a feudal technocracy where they can train forward
observers to use overly long quotes in their replies.

So there.  :P

Your answer really depends on your height.  Being a couple inches over six foot 
and more than 250 pounds of strapping manhood (oh lord, that sounds great), I 
find that I can wear a good-sized XL T-shirt, but the things are usually not 
long enough.  To get a decent length, I find myself getting a 2XL, or even a 
3XL as often as not.

Thanks for mentioning the shirts; I\'ll need to get one.

Paper I did on the Solomani military.  Sorry for all the text, but hey; its the 
start of a four-day weekend.  Besides, if I have to sit here and reorganize my 
hard drive, you should all suffer along with me.

Solomani Ground Forces Doctrine
There are 4 major ground force components in the Solomani Confederation;  the 
Confederation Marines, the Confederation Army, the Party Guard and the armies 
of the individual member worlds.  

Unlike the Imperium, the Confederation does maintain a standing army, which is 
used for large-scale ground operations for the Confederation.  The 
Confederation Marines are an elite raiding force, and is rarely deployed in 
units larger than a Regimental Combat Team (equivalent to a Imperial Marine 
brigade).  Party Guard units are used to guard Confederation political 
facilities, and to ensure loyalty in Confederation Army units and those of the 
Confederation\'s member worlds serving their Federal Duty.

Nearly all Confederation member worlds have their own standing armies.  There 
are incidents of fighting between Confederation worlds.  In these cases, if 
Confederation mediation does not succeed, the parties are allowed to fight it 
out, with certain restrictions;  The combatants must restrict their fighting to 
each other\'s worlds.  Attacks on neutral worlds or property will bring 
Confederation intervention, as will the use of atomics or biologicals.  Also, 
the combatants are prohibited from damaging each others economy or environment 
too thoroughly.  Finally, any such war must be formally declared, with at least 
three month\'s warning, and the war must be settled either militarily or 
politically within three years.  After three years, the Confederation Security 
Council will impose a settlement, enforced by Solomani Army units.

These independent militaries can be drafted for Federal Service, by 
three-fourths vote of the Security Council and majority vote of the General 
Assembly.  Such forces are generally assigned Party Guard advisors and security 
units to ensure loyalty.  Party Guard units are assigned to Confederation Army 
forces at one battalion per division; more so for Federalized forces of worlds 
with questionable loyalty.  Confederation Marine units rarely have Party Guard 
units attached, outside of a few security advisors in the headquarters units.

While member world organizations are flexible, the Confederation Army and 
Marines follow a fairly typical Terran-style pattern;  three platoons and a 
weapons platoon per company, three companies and a support company per 
battalion, three battalions and supporting units per regiment, three regiments 
and supporting units per division, etc.

Confederation Army units are uniformly equipped to TL14 standards.  
Confederation Marine units are uniformly equipped to TL15 standards.  Party 
Guard units are uniformly equipped to TL15 standards.  The military of members 
worlds have widely-varied technology, but will only be federalized if TL8 or 
better.  The Security Council classifies member world militaries by tech level; 
First Line is TL14+, Second Line is TL12-13, Third Line is TL10-11, and Fourth 
Line is TL9-.  Units are federalized in order of Line standing; Fist Line will 
be called up long before Fourth Line is alerted.

Tactically and operationally, Confederation forces are expected to show high 
levels of initiative.   Solomani NCOs and both junior and field-grade officers 
are arguably some of the best-trained military in known space.  Confederation 
operations are marked by their lightning strikes and deep-penetration raid 
tactics.  However, this competence does not extend to the strategic level.  
Confederation and Party politics are major factors in the selections of 
generals, and overall Confederation strategy is controlled by the Security 
Council, with the General Staff acting merely as advisors and expeditors.   
While many such appointees are career officers,  good commanders and planners, 
many more are merely adequate, or worse.  This makes Solomani strategy very 
subject to political whim.  This is  especially true in the logistical and 
support areas, where nearly all of the generals are political appointees.  Many 
Solomani attacks have failed due to bungled logistics or communications.

Notes: The Hunter-class gunboats were designed in response to the
increased threat of piracy accompanying the rapid growth of interstellar
trade in and around the Federation.  Few, if any, corsairs can survive a
one-on-one engagement with a Hunter.  Although the price of the Hunter
is comparable to a Type-T Patrol Cruiser, the increased combat
effectiveness offsets the lack of jump capability.  The Federation Navy
has investigated modifying large bulk freighters to "piggyback" a
squadron of Hunters.  The only significant deficiency in the design is
the sensor ranges.  Since additional sensor data is usually available
from ground/orbital or capital ship sensors, this does not pose an
operational handicap.  The ready capacity and control ability of the
missiles are listed per battery, so there are 30 missiles total, and up
to 12 can be controlled at a time.  The cargo hold is a magazine
carrying one complete reload (30 missiles) for the ship\'s missile
barbettes.  The command crew have small staterooms, the remainder have
bunks.

Well, according to *canon* and other sacred writ, the Imperial did have 
something called the Imperial Army, but outside of the 5th Frontier War you 
never heard anything about it in any adventures or other source material.  Its 
units showed up in the FFW board game, as well as Invasion:Earth, and a few 
sourcebooks mentioned Imperial Army Intelligence\'s rivalry with Naval 
Intelligence.

In my campaign (my own version of holy writ and canon), there is usually no 
such thing as the Imperial Army; it is a construct that appears when the 
Imperium or its agents "imperialize" planetary defense forces.  For the sake of 
acceptable command and control, the Imperium does maintain a command and 
support structure for the Imperial Army, but the actual fighting forces come 
from the member worlds (kind of like a feudal levy; called when needed, 
diismissed when done).  Here is the longish White Paper I wrote up on the 
Imperial ground forces for my players.  Remember that this is written for the 
1110-1120 period, so the tech levels are a wee bit inflated compared to Mileu 
Zero.

Imperial Ground Forces Doctrine
The Imperium\'s ground military is divided into two organizations; the Imperial 
Army and the Imperial Marine Corps.  Both organizations share a similar overall 
structure; 3 squads to a platoon, 3 platoons and support to a company, 3 
companies and support to a battalion, 3 battalions and support to a brigade, 3 
brigades and support to a division, etc.  On Vilani-worlds, different names are 
used for this structure, but 3 children plus a support to the parent is usually 
the rule.

The Imperial Army does not normally exist below the corps level.  In general, 
it consists of corps- and army-level support and headquarters units, equipped 
and organized to Imperial Marine Corps standards.  The bulk of the Imperial 
Army forces are made up from the military of Imperial worlds in the area.  The 
Imperial Army is made up of Army Districts, roughly analogous to subsectors.  
Some subsectors do not have enough population or military forces to create an 
Army of four to ten divisions; in these cases Army Districts may encompass 
multiple subsectors.  Also, some high-population subsectors might support two 
or even three Army Districts, but this is fairly rare.  The support and 
headquarters units are known as Regular Army units, while the rest of the fo
rces are called Colonial Army forces.

Imperial Army units are given one of three ratings.  Tier One units would be 
TL14-15 units, including the Regular Army forces in the headquarters and 
support units.  Tier Two units would be TL11-13, and Tier Three would be TL7-10 
units.  No units below TL7 are used in the Imperial Army, and Tiers are not 
mixed below the divisional level.  In addition, tech levels are not mixed 
within Tiers below the battalion level.

Imperial Army units are activated via orders from the Emperor, Domain Duke or 
Sector Duke.  In most cases, no more than 20% of a planet\'s military would be 
activated into the Imperial Army, and usually this would be no more than 5%.

The Imperial Marine Corps is the Imperium\'s main source of full-time ground 
forces.  It is uniformly equipped to TL15 standards.  All Imperial military 
facilities are guarded by Marines, and many Imperial Navy ship carry Marines 
for security.  Each Fleet has Marines assigned to it for ground combat; smaller 
fleets may only have a brigade or division, while larger fleets may have two or 
three corps.  The Marines are divided into three groups:  Fleet Marines are the 
marines assigned to Imperial Navy ships for security, boarding actions or 
raiding, or who are assigned to guard units for nobles or embassies.  Line 
Marines are those Marines assigned to larger combat units that are often 
transported by Fleet ships, but are not permanently assigned to those ships.  
Garrison Marines are those marines used to guard Imperial facilities.

There is also a separate grouping called the Imperial Guard, a division of 
Marines assigned to protect the Emperor and the Royal Family.  These marines 
are better trained than most Marines,  and  better equipped (to TL16 
standards).  They are rarely found away from the Royal Family or Emperor.  Many 
Fleet, Line or Garrison Marines who win high honors in battle are offered a 
chance to get an Imperial Guard assignment.  Most Imperial Guards are only 
retained for a few terms, but some particularly good members serve a full 
career in the Imperial Guard.  Marines leaving the Imperial Guard are assured 
of prime assignments and rapid promotions upon return to their old unit.

While there is little consistency to the doctrine used by various Colonial 
Imperial Army units, the Imperial Marines (and the Regular Imperial Army) have 
consistently adopted a doctrine of battle in depth.  An enemy attacking or 
being attacked by Imperial Marines can expect to be met with large volumes of 
heavy weapons fire and air attacks on all parts of its forces.  Its rear areas 
will have numerous small commando units roaming around destroying supplies and 
communications assets.  Its front-line units will be attacked repeatedly by 
combined-arms teams mixing infantry, armor and battledress-equipped shock 
troops.  Strongpoints will often be bypassed and surrounded by infantry, who 
will secure the perimeter while the strongpoint is bombarded from orbit.  The 
tempo of operations is maintained at a very high level, with the hope of 
breaking the enemy forces early in the campaign.

In defense, the Marines will keep as much mobility as possible, using ambushes 
and raids to weaken the enemy in expectation of a counterattack.  If the 
Marines lose a world, several commando units will remain behind to harass enemy 
forces, using numerous equipment stockpiles placed there during the original 
attack as a hedge against failure.  Imperial doctrine requires that civilians 
be spared as much as possible, but that the mission is the primary objective.  
Marines will take prisoners, but only when feasible and convenient.  Marines 
who are captured are deemed killed in action, to reduce their usefulness as 
hostages.  The prisoners may be rescued, or the areas they are held in may be 
bombed, but the Marines do not leave their comrades in enemy hands unless there 
is no other alternative.  This attitude extends to other Imperial personnel; 
Navy, Scouts or government personnel, or even civilians.  In the case of 
civilians, the Marines will usually try a rescue, but the overall philosophy is 
the same in either event.

As a matter of Imperial doctrine, if the Marines are used in an operation in 
which a noble has been taken hostage, or in which illegal nuclear weapons have 
been involved, the Marines will not only take no prisoners, they will in fact 
try to cause as much damage and terror as possible.  This activity will be 
carefully recorded and used in Imperial propoganda, to discourage such 
activities in the future.

Very true.  Actually, I got caught up in the same misperception when I 
was running a BBS from 90-95.  I\'d see these 11-13 year olds come on line 
and they\'d be capable of carrying on a conversation...typing and all.  So 
when I saw reports of rampant illiteracy in American schools, I thought, 
"Not from what I can see!"   Of course, that was just it:  what I was 
seeing was a self-selected group of people who posted /because/ they were 
literate.

So, I fell for the same fallacy twice.  Sigh.

I shudder at the thought.

I\'ll design an aging table for those years.  It will have one Interval, 
and the roll to avoid aging effects will be 13+.

Oh, no! :)  You\'re not even going to provide the correct answer?  You\'re 
going to force me to do the whole calculation the proper way?  Eek!

Hopefully some kind soul will figure out the average score for "4D 
subtract the lowest die" so I won\'t have to. :P

    'body' => 'Here\'s a TL12 tank design I\'ve been working on using FF&S, it has two
different variants: the Fusion/HEPlaR variant and the High-Bypass
turbofan/fuel cell variant.

This design started out as a smaller design, but I ran into problems
with the minimum fusion plant size, so I switched to turbofans as the
thrust agency. Unfortunately, b/c of the limited space available
turbofans didn\'t work very well either (no range). I ended up enlarging
the design considerably to make them fit. In the process, fusion plants
again became viable.

Because there are bean-counters in every organization, I felt that it
wasn\'t unreasonable to keep the HBT design. It has much inferior range/
speed performance but is CONSIDERABLY cheaper to buy, and somewhat
cheaper to maintain as well. Other than thrust agency, the two designs
are identical in crew, sensors, armour and armament. The HBT variant has
a supplementary fuel cell as the jet doesn\'t generate enough power to run
all onboard systems, and also has a battery sufficient to run electronics
for quite a while so you don\'t have to run the powerplant, and provide a
backup in case the fuel cells fail.

The combined stats for the two follow, note I\'ve used _actual_ mass, not
the slop rule, to determine thrust ratios and speed.

I will post all of the designed when I have finished updating them, along
with explanations of how things are supposed to work on a tactical sense.

Here are my questions from those that actually found the time to play BL
or BR.

1. How useful are area jammers?  I want to design Wild Weasel craft to
spoof and destroy enemy sensors, and to cover attack fighters while they
close with other ships.

2. I know that ships can "hand-off" sensor locks.  If so, then could a
AWACS type craft lock on to craft, then hand off the signals to Ladar on
fighters?

3. How will missiles work, are they Detlasers like in TNE, or are they
HE/Nukes like CT/MT.

4. How many sensor locks can a ship maintain?

Lastly and most importantly how will these fit into the "new" space combat
system?

Also I have updated my web page to include a MS Excel spreadsheet to
design craft.  It is based on Dave\'s form at the end of the SSDS.  Let me
know.  DCB

Can be useful.  Optional sensor rules help with any sensor stuff since
BL/BR is broken in this regard (no real penalty for going active, so
actives dominate).  Might be interesting to put \'em on missiles carried
by the WW.

Sure.  A good idea.  With house sensor rules where passives do better
vs. actives (I suggest at least allowing the passives to use the
combined SRs of the passive sensor, and the one "gone active") the AWACs
would be asking for an Anti-Radiation Missile (ARM) :-)

I think T4 will support all types, though missiles requiring physical
contact would be much less likely to survive anti-missile fire.

> 4. How many sensor locks can a ship maintain?
 
As far as I know from BL/BR, infinite.  An interesting question though
when swarms of missiles come into play in fleet battles...

Hopefully very well.

30Ktons, with mother ships in the 500Kton range.  CAs were anywhere from
50Ktons to 100Ktons (AZH was 60KTons), escorts were in the 3-5000 ton
range for close escorts, and 5000-10000 for Destroyer Escorts.  Carriers
ranged from the TL-15 Pocket carrier (10 or 30 Ktons) to the Book 9 Fleet
Carriers at 100 Ktons.

That of course was 3I circa 1100.  Circa 0 the ships will most likely be
smaller.  I would still expect a BB to be the largest thing on the Space
Lanes.  At least 50-100Ktons.  Cruisers might be 10-50Ktons.  Escorts
would still be in the 2-10Kton range.  One reasons ships could be smaller
is that at J-2, much less tonnage is required for fuel (most c 1100 ships
were J-4 or 5) so 20-30% of the ships would now be available for
weaponry.

With the lack of small fusion at TL-11-, how about the use of Large Boat
Tenders.  I still think a design say TL-11 of a 10Kton craft carrying 3
1000 ton craft (kind of like a battle rider system only smaller scale). 
Another idea would be for 30 100 ton craft.  The 1Kton craft might be able
to mount a spinal weapon thus making them small ships of the line.

Really !?!  That much?  So... by my estimates (based on "Fighting Ships of
the Shattered Imperium", correct me if I\'m wrong), they should be about:

Dreadnaughts...3000-4000
Battleships... 2000-3000
Battle Rider Tenders... 1000-2000
Battle Riders... 1500-2500
Heavy Cruisers... 1800-2600
Carriers... 1300-1500
Escorts... 1100-2000

Of course, FSotSI gives three different armour values... ending in either
"E", "F", or "G".  I am again clueless to what these mean.

I am simply trying to rebuild some of these "canon" vessels using FF&S.
I\'m not looking at trying to create another Bismark (that will come later
when I am more familiar with the rules  8-)

I have Campaign Cartographer...  Haven\'t used it much though.  You 
can definitely set up a hex or square grid behind the maps.  Most of 
the things you typically see on a Traveller deck plan are included as 
predefined objects, although you can definitely create your own.

The thing is that FFS does armor better than the old rules did.  In
the CT stuff, armor was a fixed % of ship regardless of
displacement.

FFS has you make a skin of some thickness with an armro rate per
unit thickness.  A meter thick hull might be a tiny % of a megaton
ship, but it would take up a huge % of a lifeboat a few meters long.

Armor then, gets cheaper (displacement wise) as size goes up.  Also,
remember that my figures were for TL14-15 ships!  I\'d expect them to
be about half at TLs12-13 and about 1/4 at 10-11 due to materials
changes (toughness of armor drops by half, then a little less than
half again).

For a wedge shape:

AV-FFS		Ship	%
(BR)		Size	of ship
- ----	----	----
500(10)		100T	11.48
500		1000	5.36
""		10000	2.49
""		100000	1.13
""		1MT	0.52

4000(20)	100	91.83
""		1kT	42.86
""		10kT	19.9
""		100kT	9.03
""		500kT	5.3
""		1MT	4.19

15,000(30)	100kT	33.87
""		500kT	19.86
""		1MT	15.73

The BR rating in parenthesis is multiplied by 10 to get the T4 Armor
Rating (which isn\'t really important for designing stuff since
weapons are scaled to the FFS/BL values anyway).

Flame and lurking skills are either cascade skill under communications
(1980s rpgs), or independent skills related to communications (1990s rpgs).
Either can be role-played, of course, but in some situations a task roll
should be made.  For example:

Guanxi is Chinese; I think Mandarin.  It seems to be pronounced more or less
"gwahn shee", with the first syllable rising and the second short and flat.
I don\'t speak either langauge, so I\'m not sure how it\'s pronounced.

I\'m not sure that exact nuances exist, but here\'s my understanding of the term:

Guanxi refers to one\'s total network of contacts.  The bigger and better
placed your network, the greater your guanxi, and, thus, the more effective
you are.  Guanxi varies geographically and by subject.  For example, I have
a pretty good guanxi in the Bay Area plaintiffs\' complex litigation bar.  In
Los Angeles, much less guanxi.  In the Bay Area Republican Party, even less.

A PC\'s guanxi could develop during character generation.  After five terms
in the Navy in the Spinward Marches, e.g., even as an NCO, one would know a
lot about who was who, and would have contacts in certain places, and not
only in the Navy establishment.

I\'d have to disagree with this.  In a situation where civilisation has been
dramatically knocked back, and where many citizens (many of whom
were perhaps office workers, or teachers, or architects, or computer
programmers) have to survive by trying to \'figuring out how to plant and
grow crops\' literacy could be a vitally important skill.

Got a bunch of former city dwellers trying to work out how to run an arable
farm? I\'d have thought that an expedition into the nearest ruined city to
check out a library would be a good idea.  Technology crashed to the
extent that holographic teaching tapes, CD-ROMs, even VCRs are
not a practical source of information?  Don\'t need very high tech to
transmit information via the printed page.

I would have thought that many adults would be determined to teach their
children to read and to write, as vital skills that would be necessary if 
the
children were to have a better life than their parents, and if they were to
have any hope of rebuilding a shattered society.  In such a society those
with Real skills - farmers, doctors, engineers - might be in very short
supply, and as a consequence hard to find or expensive to use.  Most
people would have to learn to do these things themselves.  I\'d have thought
that the written word would be a useful and efficient way of doing this.

Standards of literacy may well fall as formal teaching disappears, but
I don\'t think that they would disappear, or become as bad as USENET.

Only if you read your map upside down.  Try that, it makes the planet
look really strange.  We\'re so used to north being up it takes our brain
a few seconds to figure out whats going on.  There\'s another really neat

Whoops.  Looks like we\'ve been hit with the "Virus = Data" thing, with a
side order of "Virus = Program."  Although FF&S says that, in a pinch, a
passive EMS system could be rigged to act as a radio receive, this is not
its default operating mode.  If you broadcast the Junkie MBR virus (to
cite a contemporary example) over a digital radio link and a passive EMS
picks it up, it doesn\'t go "Oh, hey, let\'s download this incoming radio
transmission."  It merely notes the bearing (and, given time to build up
a target track, distance) to a source that is emitting EM radiation in
the radio wave spectrum.  Receiving, demodulating, and decoding that
emission is nominally the job of the ship\'s communications suite (which
was typically all too happy to lock in the signal and eventually get
kaboshed by the Virus-infected equipment effecting the transmission).  In
"Survival Margin" it is admitted that it is slightly conceivable that a
Virus infection may have been transmitted by modulating an EM source
until a receiving EMS sensor was affected, but also states that such an
infection had never occurred.

This is probably the paradigm you should be using when considering
Virus.  It does no good to consider Virus to be a wierd chunk of data or
a malicious program, because it is neither of these things.  Any
Virus-infected computing device of sufficient power becomes your meddling
eight-year-old nephew or younger brother, who will attempt to gain access
to your computer and play hob with it while you\'re not looking, until
such time as he\'s gained complete control of it and everything hooked up
to it, at which time he uses it to massacre you, your entire family, and
anyone else who happens to be around.  When any other explanation or
hand-waving falls short, I prefer to use the above "Virus = Death Monkey"
paradigm.

Now, if it\'s to a Virus-infected computer\'s advantage to use a wierd
chunk of data, or cook up a malicious program, it\'ll probably do so.

I am now transfixed by this irregular, though round, shadow which is
steadily growing larger and larger.  What\'s that whistling sound?

It\'s very true that the priorities shift in that situation.  Plus, the
mortality rate would be worse, so those who had been trained to read
prior to the collapse would be mostly dead after 70 years.  I guess
I didn\'t think it through.

Yes - it is only in the movies where someone will take a shot at someone
holding a gun at the head of a hostage because of the problem of muscle
tension (and any good terrorist will have a deadman switch on the
explosives).  A sniper (or more usually in a hostage situation a team of
snipers) will wait until the target(s) relax before engaging.  Snipers have
waited for days to get the "right" shot.

Quite all right.  Just don\'t let it happen again or I\'ll be forced to
drop a rock on your head.  8)

Seriously, its just something that all of us on the Internet take for
granted, Literacy.  Remember even today there\'s a huge chunk of the
earth\'s populace that are totally illiterate (and then there\'s the rest
of us who can\'t spell worth shit so we may as well be illiterate 8)   ).
 Imagine how much the mortality rate would have climbed during the
collapse, it\'s a pretty staggering thought.

Do recall that any port supporting HEPlar, and other reaction drives is
going to need a *lot* of space. More than your average airport, just
for noise control. And by the time thruster plates come in, there\'ll
still be things like the sonic booms from departing ships, and the
(small but real) chance of a crash. And lower tech ships will still be
showing up. 

So I\'d say that all ports have a section for such ships, and frankly,
given the space required, and theextra security that such berths
provide, they\'d probably just do it for all the berths. 

Airframe vessels would use runways (possible restricted to one section,
more likely laid out in the space between berths for the vertical
takeoff ships). They migh have hangars, more likely, they\'d just park
next to an assigned berth, if not *inside* it.

VTHL ships *would* have to be parked in a berth, as they\'d need to be
set on their tail for takeoff anyway. 

A berth would consist of a blast pit, with a water deluge cooling
system on worlds that have lots of water. Otherwise, it just gets
relined as needed. The berths come in various sizes, and the ship\'s
landing legs easily straddle the blast pit.

Around the pit, but at a distance, is a berm several meters tall. It
may be in one section, or in several offset sections. It serves several
purposes. First, it helps reduce the noise of landing and takeoff, by
absording and deflecting the sounds that would otherwise propogate
across the port at ground level. It almost complete handles the noise
from any static tests the ship\'s engineer may run while on the ground
(a not infrequent part of even minor engine maintenance).

The berm also serves as a blast shield in case a ship crashes. Most
landing and takeoff trajectories are such that a ship that loses power
at an inconvenient moment will crash fairly near the berth. It also
protects the ship inside the berth if someone crashes *outside* the
berth. 

The berm also acts as the first level of security barrier around a
ship. Both the port and the crews like this function. The crew can put
their locks on the gates thru the berm and have some assurance that
they\'ve restricted access to the ship, likewise, the customs
authorities can lock the larger gates and only have to worry about the
personnel gates. (Each gate has provisions for up to a dozen padlocks
on it).

The berms frequently contain and protect such things as refuling gear
and cargo handling gear. They also have provisions for storage in
compartments inside. It is possible to "rent" a berth if you visit a
port frequently. This allows you to store spare parts, unsold cargo,
etc inside. Again, this keep both ship owners and customs happy, as
items don\'t have to be cleared unless they leave the berthing area.

Since even normal berths are likely to have people do ing some
maintainence work, there are some minimal living facilities inside
(showers, bathrooms, minimal cooking facilities). While these are
intended for use by crew or maintence personell when working on a ship
that has such systems shut down, most ports will look the other way if
the crew uses them for living quarters while on planet, as the berthing
fees more than cover the power and water use. Most crews would rather
find a hotel, but the option is available. Think of it as a barracks
with a kitchenette...

Berths intended for major maintenance "drydocks", will not let the
players use the quarters unless the players have rented the berth,
rather than just contracted for the overhaul. 

The offsets in the berm segments on segmented berms are usually large
enough to get a VTHL type craft into the berth. (Segmented berms are
built like a pair of concentric partial circles, aligned such that
the gaps in one circle are more than covered by the next circle)

HTHL craft use "hangar" space that is essentialy squared-off standard
berth (segmented berm) with a modified blast pit set into one side of
the berm and anchor points for static motor tests. Otherwise it\'s much
the same as any other berth. You just taxi (or tow) the ship thru the
gap in the berms.

All berths have provisions for *some* sort of weather protection for
the ships. It may be merely sectional tarps and tiedowns along the rim
of the inner berm section, or it may be an elaborate retracting segment
dome. "Hangar" type berms usually have solid, if flimsy roofing with
vents around the edges (think corrugated aluminum or the like). It
depends on the port, and how expensive the berth is.

Berths are *widely* seperated. At least 500 meters, more likely a
kilometer. Large berths are more widely seperated than small berths
because of big ships are noisier than little ships. There are wired
comm links to the berth. Linkage to the port switchboard is part of the
fee. Calls outside the port (ie to the surrounding "startown") or extra
lines cost extra. 

There are shuttles available between the berths and the port offices
and other facilities. But they tend to stick to the areas used by the
larger passenger ships, and the big commercial lines. if your ship is
off by itself, you\'ll likely have to call in for a special run, and get
cxharged accordingly (think of it as calling a cab).

Or you can use your ground vehicle or airraft.  Air-raft operation
within the port is *very* restricted due to safety concerns. You must
always contact the tower and get approval of your route. Failure to do
so, or deviating from the route will result in fines, and confiscation
of the vehicle. It\'s usually simpler to rent a wheeled or ground effect
vehicle to get back and forth if you don\'t have one.

Anybody have any comments? Or should I just polish it up, add drawings
and send it to JTAS? :-)

Well, I forgot "Lucifer" a *large* black unicorn hand puppet with red
eyes (how large? Well my *entire* arm is his neck). And as for minerals
I have a green malachite pryamid on top of the modem.

I have one for you. I was asked by a friend who was writing his own FRP
(it was kinda fun, even if it nevergot to the publishable stage), to
design a *possible* mineral that met certain criteria. What I came up
with was Uranyl Silicate crystals. Beautiful yellow crystals. And
radioactive as hell! On his world, if you aren\'t a member of certain
races, you leave glowing gemstones *alone*!

For that matter, SF is full of neat gemstones, most of them at least
*plausible*. Thermo luminesence seems popular. Zarathustran sunstones,
for example.

If you have some sufficiently odd races in your campaigns, you\'ll get
*really* weird gemstones. Consider a race that lives on outer planet
moons at about -100 C. They may have gemstones that are nothing more
than impure ice or amonia crystals. Won\'t it be fun transporting
*those*.

The Legion has a some interesting attitudes. "March or Die" for
instance. 

And given the nature of Legionairres, even these days, I have to wonder
if they ones that turned in that 45 minute time knew a few "shortcuts".

So where do I get it, what does it cost, and what hardware/OS does it
require? I can\'t easily use it if it take Windows, a 386, or VGA. On
the other hand, if it supports DeskJet printers or even better, HP
Plotters, then I\'m *real* interested (I have a 7475A I\'m not using for

EPS is Encapulsated PostScript. And I have yet to see anything cheap
that will convert *from* EPS to another format. You should be able to
view EPS files with GhostScript, but I don\'t know where to get a copy.

DXF is a new one for me. Never heard of it.

Well, considering how print had been supplanted by holocrystal and 
magnetic media, once the Collapse happened and everything went bonkers, 
there wasn\'t much to read except road signs.  In a different scenario, 
like the Long Night, which is more of a gradual slowdown rather than a 
sudden collapse of society, and from a lower average tech level, more 
text was still in print form and even that which wasn\'t might have only 
suffered a power failure, and just needed some wattage in order to be 
accessed (and read) again.

Therefore, literacy would be much harder to maintain in the aftermath of 
a sudden, watershed event like the Collapse than it would have been 
during an interregnum such as the Long Night.

Then, of course, there are some hicks and crackers who never bothered to 
read in the first place, civilization or not.

This presumes that tight beam communicators were used.  Nothing in the 
text says this is the case.  I\'d hardly say that an assumption that you 
yourself made proves your case.  You also make some assumptions about 
Passive EMS sensors that are difficult to support.  Your eyeballs are 
passive sensors.  Granted, they don\'t pick up anything outside of the 
visible light spectrum, but if I took an audio transmission of, say, 
American Top 40 and used it to modulate a visible light source, would you 
hear the week\'s #1 pick?  Would a video camera, even a high speed one?  
Given a high enough speed camera, one could conceivable demodulate the 
visible source and get the broadcast, but now we\'re assuming that a great 
number of steps have been taken.  True, it says that a passive EMS sensor 
can function as a radio receiver in a pinch, but it is never stated that 
this is a standard mode of operation.  A passive EMS\'s normal mode would 
note the location and strength of a source emitting EM radiation in the 
radio wave spectrum, but not much more.  Demodulating it under routine 
conditions is someone else\'s job, namely the communicator\'s.

It\'s already stated that Dulinor\'s ship\'s actually took the step of 
downloading the transmission directly into their computers.  It is not 
stated that none of Lucan\'s people did the same thing, nor is the 
possibility that a transponder set could have soaked up the transmission 
disallowed.  It\'s a given that Dulinor\'s fleet actively took on Virus 
infestations, and it\'s also stated that Lucan\'s fleet was not spared the 
effects of Virus.  The exact method of infection occurring to Lucan\'s 
ships is open to a slight amount of conjecture (transponders or 
computer-controlled communication systems), but there is hardly fertile 
ground for proving that any type of sensor could have served as a viable 
vector for Virus infection during that incident.

No, probably not.  I think that there\'s a point about all sorts of 
speculative phenomena peculiar to SF and/or Traveller where 
overdiscussion and overdefinition of them can actually make the concepts 
less lucid.  We\'ve gotten into the same trouble before about FTL drives 
and feudal technocracies.  I suspect that if I\'m not too careful, I\'ll 
soon cross this same Sanity Line on the Virus issue.  I\'m much more 
comfortable discussing what it is not rather than what it is.

Especially when they\'re travelling significant fractions of the speed of 
light.  Say, I hear that they\'re pretty hard to stop once they reach 0.1 C...

I understand it breaks down into something not too awkward for a pair
to handle. And if we were up against high-tech troops, I bet we\'d be
using them or worse. 

As I recall, someone figured out that the Finnish 20 mm Lahti, and the
Soviet 17mm ancestor of the SKS could both nail even troops in
Battledress. 

Such a surprise those troops will get when they invade the "low tech"
world. 

(BTW, if you haven\'t read it, David Drake\'s "Forlorn Hope" has a fun
version of this where a merc company finds themselves excluded from the
ceasefire and amnesty because they managed to take out a starship being
used for a surface bombardment run with their anti-armor weapon. They
have to find a way back to the starport lines before the winners find them)

The pictures I saw sure looked like a passenger ship to me.

I know the AEC had a lot of control/supervision because of the reactor,
but I do believe it was privately owned. Anybody got a copy of Janes,
or the Lloyd\'s registry?

> IAC, it proved to be non-viable economicly, didn\'t it?

Yep. Because before it could pay off, folks started getting nervous
about nuclear power. So bookings went thru the floor.

I also suspect that while it had cargo capacity (most liners used to
carry some cargo, usually stuff that requires a bit more speed than
regular frieeghters, but don\'t merit air cargo prices), they may have
tried fort a compromise between cargo and passenger and gotten the
worst features of both. Also the drop of air cargo prices in the 60\'s
pretty much killed the idea of having cargo capacity in excess of
passenger needs on passenger ships.

Passenger liners in general were doing bad in the 60s until the new
generation of cruise liners came into existence, where the point was
the *cruise*, not getting from point A to point B, however comfortably.

I think the Savannah was a victm of bad timing. If it had been built in
the early to mid 50s, it might have done ok. 

These days, even if the financing looked ok, I doubt you could get a
nuclear powered civilian ship built easily. Passenger ships wouldn\'t
get the business, and nuclear power really doesn\'t "buy" them anything.

Freighters and tankers get the axe for a couple of reasons. Partly
because of anti-nuclear protesters and partly because of the fact that
some of the better runs for such ships go into places like the mideast,
where we just *don\'t* want to risk the ship getting hijacked. Just
think what Iraq would do if they got their hands on such a ship.

But by the time of the Imperium, nuclear power is as old as *iron* is
now. People aren\'t going to be *unrealisticly* worried about it, and
they\'ll have several *thousand* years of experience tell them what the
odds of various sorts of accidents are.

It\'s also likely that an active, expanding society is going to be a lot
less "safety at any cost" than our current society.

The trouble is, the power avialable from fusing elements drops rapidly
as the atomic weight goes up.

Fusing helium to carbon produces a *lot* less energy than fusing
hydrogen to helium.  And it gets rapidly worse after that.  To figure
the energy release, just add up the atomic weight of the starting
nuclei, and subtract it from that of the resulting nucleus.  That\'s the
mass converted to energy.

The usual fusion chain in a star is fusing 4 H-1 to 1 He-4, then when
the hydrogen in the core runs out, the core compresses and the temp
goes *way* up. That allows fusing 3 He-4 to 1 C-12. I think the next
step is silicon, and the final stage is when you get to Fe-56.

The thing is, the Imperium is more like an archipelago, rather than an
island or continent. Plus, there\'s no "high seas" once they run into
other territories. 

These two factors taken together make the navy vs coast guard roles
strike a *very* different balance. So I\'d say that things break down
like this:

Some spacefaring planets have "planetary guards" that handle things
from the limits of the atmosphere to some Imperially defined "limit of
planetary sovereignty". Others don\'t.

Some planets claim large portions of their system as their territory.
These are mostly planets that got that far *before* contact. They may
have joined the Imperium under terms that left the control of these
portions of their systems. In exchange for this, *they* are responsible
for patrolling the system except in emergencies.

Both of the above are like sort of like "state police" with some extra
duties. I\'m basing some of this on Oregon\'s quite serious threat to
set up a state *navy* using some surplus vessels if the Coast Guard
didn\'t start doing a better job of enforcing fishing restrictions in
our territorial waters. 

I suspect that the "coast guard" is *part* of the Navy, much like the
Army Air Corp used to be part of the Army. They\'d have the right to go
after things clear down to the limit of planetary sovreignty, and
possibly beyond. (Sort of like how both the Sheriff\'s department and
the Coast Guard *both* patrol the Willamette and the Columbia).

So the coast guard would be responsible for a lot of search and rescue
vessels, "cutters" (several hundred ton armed vessels used occasionally
for S&R, but mostly for customs and patrol work). They\'d also be
responsible for the SDBs and their tenders. In fact, I\'d say most
"normal" system defence stiuff would be theirs. 

The "real Navy" would have the battleships and battle riders and all
the "escort" type ships.

So just as Coast Guard units served in Vietnam and the Gulf, the
Imperial Navy would grab such units as they might need for system
defense and patrolling duties for the units normally assigned to such
things. 

I expect that there\'d be some intense rivalry between the two halves of
the Navy. Both would look down on the other side.

Once the true nature of the Deyo transponder suite was discovered, they 
were scrapped.  Any pre-Collapse ship which still has one within its hull 
has probably had the plug pulled in order to activate their auto-fry 
mechanisms.  Also, post-Collapse ships don\'t have anywhere near the 
systems integration that earlier models did; the more \'dispersed\' 
architecture was necessary to prevent the possible spread of Virus 
infestation.  It\'s also stated that communications are now done by hand.  
It can probably be a pain in the butt when you\'re trying to maintain a 
tight-beam link during violent maneuvering, but it beats being the ball 
in a game of Grav-Pong.

They\'re great if they\'re not on your craft.  Any craft carrying an area 
jammer is much easier to pick up on passive (well, duh!), but they do 
make sensor tasks that trace a line of sight through their area of effect 
twice as difficult (I don\'t want to go into details, suffice it to say 
that I\'m *really* simplifying things here.  Twich as difficult = "one 
additional difficulty level") for each HEX that the line of sight passes 
through.  If you\'ve got several area-jammer drones in a line, you can set 
up a barrage of EM noise that\'s very hard to see through.

Yes.

They\'re them nuke-u-lar det-o-nation x-ray laze-ur thingys.  Apparently, 
the guys who designed BL/BR had a hard time accepting that a missile 
would survive the last 30,000 km to the target without getting fried by 
defensive fire.  They made a pretty darn good case for their argument, too.

> 4. How many sensor locks can a ship maintain?

As many as they\'ve got sensors for.  Typically a ship\'s main array(s) 
will get the initial target locks, hand them off to the dedicated EMS 
sensors of master fire directors, and then go look for more.

I\'ve got absolutely no idea.  I suspect that they won\'t matter as much, 
if at all, in the simplified combat system.

Imperial Naval Doctrine
The Imperium has the largest fleet in known space, with more than 1,000 
squadrons organized into 50-plus fleets and independent entities.  Imperial 
fleets are made up of 1 or more Groups, each of which is made up of 3 or more 
squadrons.  In smaller or less-populated Sectors, there might be a small fleet, 
made up of one Group with three Squadrons.  In Sectors that are likely to be 
attacked, there are often 3 or more fleets, each with 3 or 4 Groups of up to 10 
Squadrons each.  Each Sector has at least 1 Fleet assigned to it.

A Squadron generally consists of 8 to 12 ships.  Some of the ships are support 
or communications vessels, and the rest make up the \'line\' of the Squadron.  
For example, a typical Heavy Battle Squadron (HBatRon) would consist of 1 
Dreadnaught, 2 Battleships, 4 Battlecruisers, 2 Fleet Couriers and 1 Squadron 
Tender.  The Fleet Couriers and Squadron Tender would be the support element, 
while the Dreadnaught, Battleships and Battlecruisers would be the Squadron 
line.

A Group is a collection of Squadrons, usually organized around some large ship 
or important Squadron.  For example, a Battle Group would be formed around a 
HBatRon, while a Carrier Group would be formed around a Fleet Carrier Squadron 
(FCarRon).  The Imperium also has Assault Groups, Raid Groups, Patrol Groups, 
Transport Groups, Support Groups and even a few Recon Groups.  Each Group will 
have its own Group Support Squadron in addition to its component Squadrons; 
this unit would have a number of couriers, tenders and perhaps troop transports 
or hospital ships.  Squadrons are often reassigned to other Groups at various 
times, or even other Fleets.

A Fleet is a collection of Groups, usually organized along mission lines as 
necessitated by the needs of the Sector the Fleet is based in, or on the 
conditions around the Sector.  In some sectors, the Fleet might consist of a 
Patrol Group of only three Squadrons.  A Fleet generally has a few Squadrons of 
attached elements, with couriers, tenders and some troop transports, but this 
varies by Fleet.

All Imperial Depots house a Reserve Fleet, made up of overage and reserve 
vessels stored there.  Reserve Fleets are generally used for training 
activities and to support Depot operations, but in the event of a crisis they 
could be used to provide replacements for regular Fleets, or could be mobilized 
into action as a Regular Fleet in its own right.  

Many worlds of the Imperium field military starships.  These ships are all 
subject to mobilization in the Colonial Navy, an ad-hoc organization formed 
when the Sector or Domain Duke mobilizes non-Imperial starships and mercenary 
warships.  In general, most of these ships tend to be patrol ships or smaller 
combatants, so mobilized Colonial Squadrons are most often used to form a 
single Sector-wide Colonial Fleet, which would usually be used for rear-area 
security.  Those mobilized ships which are stronger combatants will either be 
used to support Colonial Fleet operations, or may be combined into Colonial 
Squadrons attached to combat-oriented Imperial Fleets.

Imperial doctrine has changed over the past 200 years.  Formerly, the Imperial 
Navy was geared toward offensive actions.  Imperial fleets were configured for 
rapid raiding operations, with enough heavy firepower to tie down defenders 
while the raids were undertaken.  The goal was to cripple an enemy\'s economy 
and military infrastructure to the point that it collapsed, leaving the enemy 
frontier defenseless.

This began to change in the face of wars with the Zhodani Consulate and other 
foreign powers.  The Imperium had been successfully attacked in the past, but 
these were minor raids by pirates and small splinter groups within the 
Imperium.  The new situation was that the Imperium had an active, hostile enemy 
on several borders (Zhodani, Aslan) and rebellious elements within another 
border region (Solomani Autonomous Region).  This new reality caused the 
Imperial Navy to realign itself towards a more defensive role.  The Imperium 
did not give up its offensive capabilities; but offense was no longer the focus 
of Imperial design.  Large, high-jump vessels were replaced with large, 
high-firepower vessels.  Lighter raiding ships remained part of the Imperial 
Navy structure, but these were no longer supported by larger ships in their 
penetration raids.

The Solomani Rim War caught the Imperium in the midst of this change.  The 
Solomani fleet, made up of former Imperial personnel and equipment, shared a 
similar doctrine, but was more oriented towards offense due to Solomani 
cultural biases, and due to the inability of the Solomani economy to support a 
protracted attritional defense.  The Solomani sphere was badly hurt by 
small-scale Imperial raiders, but the rimward portions of the Imperium were 
even more devastated.  The result was a tie; both sides withdrew in the hopes 
of rebuilding enough strength to finish the job, but the horror of the conflict 
made the armistice a more permanent treaty.  To the Vilani-dominated Imperial 
Naval Staff of that time, this only proved the need for a more defense-oriented 
military structure, and spelled an end to the Solomani-influenced emphasis on 
raiding tactics in the Imperial Navy.  Thereafter, raids would be but minor 
sideshows in Imperial Navy thinking.

The modern Imperial Navy philosophy is to use overwhelming firepower and 
numbers to break any attack, and to then counterattack against the 
now-disorganized enemy forces.  This is made possible by the fantastic 
logistical advantage of the Imperium.  The Imperium is three times larger than 
the other interstellar states, and has a huge industrial and manpower potential 
the other states can only dream of.  This means the Imperium can send fleets 
from quiet Sectors to trouble areas, and rapidly build replacement ships or 
even fleets.  Obviously, the Imperial Navy cannot be at all border points at 
once, so the philosophy envisions a defense in depth, buying time until 
sufficient forces are gathered to make a stand, after which the lost territory 
will be regained (with possibly more territory being claimed in the process).

Note that the ships listed below are nearly all TL15 ships.  Lower tech ships 
can be found in Imperial Navy Depots and in Colonial units.  There are also a 
number of experimental TL16 ships, but these are largely found in composite 
Experimental Squadrons (XRon) in Depots.  Final decisions on TL16 fleet designs 
was scheduled for 1120, but that has been interrupted by the Civil War.  
Existing TL16 ships have been activated with other Depot forces.

Ships of the Imperial Navy
Dreadnaught
Range from 750,000 to 1,000,000 tons displacement.  Rated at Jump 3, with 2G+ 
thrust.  These ships carry up to three wings of fighters, and up to a division 
of Marines for security and assault duties.  These ships are named for Emperors 
of the 1st, 2nd or 3rd Imperia.  They serve as the core of a Heavy Battle 
Squadron (HBatRon)  There are three classes in active Imperial service:
Cleon class, 1,000,000 tons displacement
Plankwell class, 850,000 tons displacement

Solomani Naval Doctrine
The Solomani Navy is a well-trained force, equipped to TL14 and TL15 
standards.  The Solomani emphasize Blitzkreig tactics in their naval doctrine.  
Assault units and heavy battleships will break the main line of resistance, 
pinning down heavy enemy forces.  While the enemy heavy forces are neutralized, 
the raiders will move into the enemy rear areas.  This is an embodiment of the 
Solomani \'Total War\' concept; the raiders will move against headquarters areas, 
supply depots, starports, shipyards and merchant ships, with the intent of 
paralyzing the enemy\'s military and economy.  These raiders will be accompanied 
by Confederation Mairines, who will land on planets to destroy important 
military and economic facilities and to carry off loot and prisoners.  Priso
ners are questioned for data on other raid targets, and are then generally 
released unharmed, unless the prisoner is an important person politically, 
socially, militarily or scientifically.

A Solomani naval attack will either be a raid, or will have raiding elements 
attached to it.  In a full multi-fleet attack, half og the commited fleets will 
remain in the reserve.  In each attacking fleet,  the two assault groups of the 
fleet will engage the enemy\'s main line.  An overstrength raiding group, with 
twice the number of squadrons as an Assault Group, will generally split into 
four to six task forces, each with 1 to 3 squadrons.  These will zip into the 
enemy\'s territory, with the intent of raiding for four to eight weeks before 
returning.  At that time, the entire fleet will go into the reserve,  returning 
to base for repair and replenishment.  It will be immediately replaced on the 
front line with another fleet from the reserve, which will do the same.  This 
doctrine is very rough on the fleets; the first set of attacking fleets will 
generally suffer 50% casualties and be forced to combine with other damaged 
fleets to build a full-strength unit.  However, the effects on the enemy are 
immediate and devastating; the enemy\'s main line will suffer some casulaties, 
but the main damage will be apparent when supplies stop reaching the beleagured 
defenders.  As the bases, depots and starports are hit, supplies will dwindle.  
The losses to civilian shipping will prevent supplies from reaching the 
defenders, and needed reinforcements will be pulled away to chase down the 
raiders.  And, as the economies of the worlds near the battleline begin to 
falter, the defenders may be faced with insurrection or desertion.

The Solomani also have some other unique unit types in the navy.  One is the 
Interdiction Task Force.  This is a unit made up of typical escort-type ships, 
with one or more Interdiction Squadrons as its main force.  These squadrons are 
made up of Interdiction Cruisers, which have a low Jump rating but are 
configured for long stays in orbit interdicting ship traffic and acting as a 
bombardment platform.  This sort of unit is used on worlds suffering from an 
Interdiction Edict from the Confederation Assembly or Security Council.  This 
may happen due to disease, rebellion or disobedience of Security Council 
regulations concerning war with another Confederation world.

Another unique unit is the Customs Squadron.  Employed in especially-busy 
systems, this consists of an Escort Carrier and a number of Customs Cruisers.  
These ships are small and fast, with moderate armor and armament.  They are 
used to carry a squad of troops to perform inspections on ships entering or 
leaving the system.  These units are used in systems with piracy problems, or 
in systems that have been given some form of economic sanctions from the 
General Assembly or Security Council.

As with ground forces, the Confederation Navy may call upon the naval forces of 
member worlds when necessary.  The procedures are similar to that described for 
the ground forces, but it is rare for a world to field large naval forces, so 
such units are generally consolidated into Subsector or even Sector Squadrons, 
and are generally used for patrol and escort duties.

I also use Corel Xara for more "freehand" computer art.  This is
a smart package that Corel had to purchase \'cos it\'s so much

Note that it doesn\'t have the vast scope of Corel (3d rendering or

I think that Corel are charging about $100 for it (not sure of

IIRC, the Imperial Army organization seems to resemble the US Army in
Pre-Civil War days. That is, units are raised in a specific area, and
you tend to stay with a unit the whole time you are in the Army. And
the Army units tended to double as state militia units. 

So you\'d have things like the 57th Army (the Efate Eagles). Smaller
planets would have divisions or even companies. If a planet needs more
Army presence, but it isn\'t a revolt against Imperial authority, the
Imperial troops will serve as a cadre for training the local troops.

I\'m not really familiar with the FFS-style rules but in
HG (and I assume MT) terms this is not really the
case.  Most people seem to think that higher tech =
bigger ships, however if you play with HG/TCS long
enough you see that in fact higher tech ships become
smaller (just like calculators ;-).

This is because
1. power plants get more efficient (smaller/more power)
2. armour becomes more efficient (smaller)
3. weaponry becomes more efficient (smaller/less power)
4. any ship hit by a medium size spinal meson gun
is dead anyway (despite 2nd bridges etc). Thus it
makes sense to have as many targets for the enemy
as possible. 

In HG etc the optimum size for a capital ship is in the
40K to 20K range (depending on TL).  This is unfortunate
as many (in fact most) of the published designs are big
turkeys.

the basic book, provide designs to go along with ALL the spaceships in your

This certainly is NOT the place for political discussions.  I will say 
as an American that it has less to do with living in the cold war than it 
does with silly US pride.  Cuba ceased to be a threat to us years ago.

That\'s how they got the *data*.

Sure. They intercepted the transmissions. They they tried to figure out
what it was. "Looks like some *very* sophisticated computer code, sir".
And when they couldn\'t figure it out quickly, *some* bright lad said
"Let\'s load it into an isolated system and see what it does." 

Either it managed to infect that system and hide until it was relinked,
or they figured out enough to go "Gee, this looks like it might be some
sort of code for running on a transponder unit". In which case they
take a spare out of stores, and let it look at the code, Shortly
thereafter both that transponder *and* the ship\'s transponder are
infected. Oops!

Ah, so I was off in my back-of-the-napkin calculation.  The two methods 
do yield similar averages.
Still, I\'d use 2D6+6, since the minimum you\'ll get is 8, whereas with 
this method you can end up with lower scores.

Ahh...I wasn\'t so far off after all.  I\'d figured somewhere between 11 
and 12.  So, 2d6+6 /is/ the better method, all around.

Thanks!

Geez.  You guys make me feel out of place.  :)  All I have on my monitor 
(a top-of-the-line Commodore 1802, if you really must know :)
is a plastic Rambo-style guy with a keyboard instead of a gun and a CPU 
as his backpack (part of a line of plastic computer-programmer toys put 
out many years ago, with punnish names - I think this one was called "The 
Exterminator," a reference to bug-finding in programs).  

The only other item is an old Dilbert comic (1992).  Wally, Dilbert, and 
some other guy are in the lunch room.  The other guy says, "When I 
started programming, we didn\'t have any of these sissy \'icons\' and 
\'windows.\'  All we had were zeros and ones -- and sometimes we didn\'t 
even have ones.  I wrote an entire database program using only zeros.", 
to which Dilbert replies, "You had zeros?  We had to use the letter \'O\'."

Not only that, but it would be a hell of a job to bring literacy back.  
You\'d have to import instructors from any worlds that had retained their 
literacy.  The RC has its work cut out for it.

What the heck is this doing on the Traveller Mail?

Mr. Lindsay, why are you so upset at the tobacco Industry to begin with. You smoked on 
your own account, neither Mr. Helms(who I dont care much for either), Mr. Exon( whome I 
also think is a butthead), or Mr. Dornan Held you down and forced you to smoke. Tobacco 
May Cause Cancer. I say May because if it did cause cancer then everyone who somkes it 
should then be inflicted with cancer. But that is not so other wise there would be a 
catastofic proportion of lung cancer in todays society.

Sir I just think you are tryin to put the blame on others for your own problems( done to 
often as a whole in todays society in my opinion). I am sorry that you have cancer sir, 
but I do not know how long you have been smoking. But there were warning labels on the 
sides of the cigaret packages and yet you still smoked them or continued to smoke them 
if you started before the warning.

Also If I were you I would retract your coments about Taking certain someones with you 
when you found out you had caner. As those are Viable threats and may be taken as such, 
wether or not you met them as such. Also as I stated before it is not there fault  that 
you have cancer.

I apollogise to the rest of the Thread subscribers for this but since a statement such 
as this was posted it deamed a responce.

I must concur.  I have some very strong feelings about Jesse Helms,

286 or better...  2MB RAM, 5 MB HD Space, MS-DOS, Mouse or other 
plotting device.

Although it will work with a 286, they recommend a 386 minimum.  I 
run it on a 486-66 Mhz.  I have a feeling it would be SSSLLLOOOWWWW 
on a 286.

As to where to get it, I got it from 1 of the local game shops, so I 
wouldn\'t have a clue where to send you.

I picked it up from a local game dealer (he deals some computer 
software, mainly computer wargames, along with the usual CCG\'s, 
RPG\'s, Wargames, etc).  I picked it up for too much.  I think I spent 
about $40 or $50 on it about 8-10 months ago.  It has a very nicely 
bound manual, with plenty of examples, and a very detailed tutorial.  
I just haven\'t used it much in recent months because I haven\'t had the 
need to draw deckplans.  Maybe I\'ll play with it a little over the weekend, 
and see if I can\'t do a few of the standard Traveller ships with it...

   Sure, some of the background is iffy but the system itself is very
playable using any other milieu. The ship design (FF&S) has some
assumptions about crew sizes based upon the RC era but there are fixes for
those in beta form right now. Also, in char-gen the ship-DM\'s aspect would
have to be looked at (it assumes collapse), otherwise it\'s one of the
things I really liked about TNE.

   Alternatively, you could just do a little handwaving and ignore Virus.
Just say 3I collapsed b/c of the Civil war and gloss over why.

I like this idea.  I like it alot.  The only thing is it relys on human 
input trying to "crack Dulinor\'s Code."  It\'s probably more likely and I 
have revised my own ideas about the initial infection if you assume the 
following sequence of events:

1) Passive sensors detect transmission.  Because the sensor operator is 
busy at the moment, they begin storing the data and alert the computer.

2) The computer analyzes the first few miliseconds of the transmission, 
says "Hey this could be important."  It in turn alerts the radio which 
continues recording where passive sensors left off.  While the radio is 
recording the transmission it alerts the Reo that there\'s an encoded 
transmission eminating from the research facility.  It also alerts the 
computer when it\'s finished recording.

3) The computer immediatly begins running the received data through a 
series of de-scrambling program\'s not realizing that this is really 
"VIRUS" not an encrypted message.  The computer not wanting to disapoint 
the Reo does this automatically because it figure\'s he\'d rather look at a 
message than a screen full of video vomit.

This way the computer automatically executes the code by attempting to 
descramble it unwittingly subverting itself.  The Virus quickly subverts 
the transponder and begins beaming copies of itself to the other ships in 
the fleet.  It\'s all automatic, no human interface at all the ship 
infects itself by doing what it was programmed to do.

With the decline in medical technoligies, the emergence of harsh diseases 
like the plague etc.  I\'d imagine that a huge chunk of the population 
died in the years immediatly after the collapse.  50-60% would not be 
unlikely.

I wonder if during the collapse it might be better do begin character 
generation at 14 instead of 18...or is it 17?  Can\'t remember.  This 
would reflect the younger age at which people would become responsible 
for their own well being.  Sure when you\'ve got toaster ovens and 
microwaves it\'s easy to keep your kids around till their 28 but when 
survival means getting everyone into the feilds as early as possible and 
making them self sufficient.  You can get my point.

 Vland, Terra.  But what about all those poor people on TL-15 worlds that 
use holographic crystals etc.?  Those guy\'s are screwed in the biggest

Imagine if Virus hit the StarTrek universe.  Most of those settlements on

of nifty gadget.  Getting a book from someone is a really important gift.

The Coast Guard falls under the direct command of the Department of

Not necessarily...The Coasties, or Planetary Guardsmen, or whatever, and
the Navy would have vastly different roles.  The Guardsmen would enforce
commercial shipping regulations, search and rescue stuff, etc.  The Navy
would fly around with huge guns and shoot stuff.

MegaTraveller Armour Values are simply striker armour values... same table
(with 3 entries being different... I\'ve checked!) the AV is a semi-log or
log measure of armour toughness, in comparison to cm of steel. The letter
tells what type of armour it is: E-Crystaliron, F-Superdense, G-Bonded
Superdense.

I second that, and would add this: give the ships a reference point.  I,
for one, think it would be real cool to see a human, standing next to a
human in battle dress, standing next to a grav tank, next to a modular
cutter, next to a scout ship, next to an escort, next to a cruiser...etc.
The biggest problem I have with my players, in terms of describing a scene
are numbers.  Instead of saying, "you estimate the ship at (big number)
tons displacement", I would rather be able to say, "take a look at this
picture.  This is you in your scout ship, and THIS is the thing with which
you wish to tangle."  It might just prolong character life (I play with
some real low watt bulbs now and again).

So they fire up an interstellar Peace Corps.  How many people could an
instructor reasonably teach to read/write in a year (and were not talking
college level here)?  Also, in 70 years you would probably end up with a
written language that had regressed to symbology...how much effort would
it take to bring that back on line?

For crying out loud!  Get your facts straight before opening your mouth and

Check out the "Uncle Jesse" thread if you want to find out who wrote this
and how it esclated to your necessary response.  I deleted my copy
yesterday.  Maybe if you stopped replying to everything via "Re:

accurately aim your remarks.  If your going to flame someone, go back to
the source and get your facts straight before you make a fool of yourself.

Now perhaps you will retract the damaging things YOU said about myself so
that this stops here and now....

Good idea!  And another one:  Start a chain letter!  That way, the 
populace would HAVE to learn how to read and write, or suffer the 
consequences of "breaking the chain!" :)

I just saw Independence Day, and it does indeed contain elements VERY

ruin it for others (sigh).  Hope everyone sees it soon! :)

That\'s sort of stadard fare in the after-the-big-whoops books I\'ve read.  
So, that wasn\'t mentioned in TNE?  Interesting.

Hmm.  Maybe the parents won\'t let the kids get away because they\'re 
needed on the farm.  Perhaps, adventurer types would be extremely rare...

speaking of chain letters:

for some reason)

	This message is not good news.  It contains no stupid ASCII "art" to
complement it.  It is true.  If you don\'t forward this to 25 people
in the next 2 hours, your mother will fall deathly ill.  She will
linger a few, agonizing months, and then die. The same will happen to
your father after your mother\'s death.  Then your siblings will be
stabbed by bandits dressed a mideval knights and will bleed to death
over the course of hours.  The hospital bills for your parents will
fall to you to pay.  Also, it will be discovered that your parents
have not paid income taxes for their entire lives, and you will be
accuesed and convicted of stabbing your siblings.  After you get out
of jail 25 years from today, you will have to pay the staggering
debt and interest which has accrued on your parents\' hospital stays.
You will be unable to finish your college education and will have to
work at a minimum-wage job.  Because of the debt, you will be forced
to be celibate since you can\'t afford condoms.  The day after you
have paid it off completely, you will win the Publisher\'s
Clearinghouse sweepstakes and meet the most beautiful, charming, and
intellegent 18-year old who will swear to love you for the rest of
your life.  The next day you will be taken into a bizzare time vortex
and crucified next to Jesus.  You will promptly decend into hell and
live out eternity in unimaginable pain.

Look, I know Traveller is going to cover the beginning of Earth going into

    'body' => 'BTW:  All that follows is IIRC, I cannot find my reference book...

The term "Ship of the Line" (from Napoleonic British Naval History) was
given to any rated ship (1-6) that would enter the line of battle and sail
against the enemy line.  The rating system was used to determine the pay
of the captain and officers of the ship, and was based on the number of
guns a ship carried.  

First Raters were three or four deckers with 90-100+ guns.  They were the
battleships and flagships for the fleet.  From which Nelson and others
directed the overall battle.  

Second Raters were also three deckers, but with 75-90 guns.  They were
also "ships of the line", and were the mainstay of the English, French,
Spanish, and Dutch Navies.  They would often head up task force in foreign
waters.

Third Raters were 64+ guns two or three decks, and were the smallest of
the "ships of the line".  

Fourth Raters were the cruisers.  Not large enough to withstand the
punishment of a third rater, they mounted guns that could hurt them.  They
often operated in foreign waters, and headed up groups of frigates.  They
usually mounted about 50 guns about half and half 24 and 32 pounders.

Fifth Raters were frigates, and were used for commerce raiding.  They
carried about 30-40 guns, some as large as 24 pounders.

Sixth Raters were the smallest ships in the British Navy.  They were often
sloops, and sometimes were two masters instead of three.  They were used
for coastal defence and blockades.  They usually had about 30 guns in the
12 pounder range.

OK, now all of this is interesting to ME, but how can you relate to
Traveller.  In Traveller ships fall into 5 basic categories.

1 Ships of the Line (BBs, and CH), 2 Carriers, 3 Cruisers (CA/CL, and
variants), 4 Escorts, 5 Auxiliaries

I do not include any non-combat vessel in this breakdown.  The Ships of
the Line are supposed to for just that (the Line of the Battle), and fight
the best the Enemy has to offer.  They have to be able to destroy another
Ship of the Line, and take the punishment dealt out by one.  Cruisers can
enter the line of the battle, but even though they can deliver the
punishment of a BB, they cannot take it.  (BTW) I would put Battle Riders
in this class also.  Cruisers are more effective fighting the other sides
cruisers, and conducting commerce raiding, and fighting Escorts and
Auxiliaries.  The Escorts and Auxiliaries are there to show the flag, and
prey on and defend Merchantmen from commerce raiders and corsairs.  Their
other function is to protect the capital ships from smaller ships
(fighters/PT boats/etc.)  To this end, Ships of the Line, and Cruisers
will mount Spinal Weapons, as these are the weapons most likely to hurt
other ships of the line.  Escorts and Auxiliaries will mostly mount
smaller turret style weapons to fight off these smaller vessels.  Even a
fighter mounting a laser should be able to handle a Far Trader or such as
it will be able to pound on it from outside its sensor range.

BTW Escorts would be in the 3Kton to 10Kton range, and auxiliaries in the
100-2000 ton range.  (e.g.) Close Escorts, Patrol Cruisers, etc.

Lastly the reason ships of the line need to be protected from smaller
ships is that even though the primary weapons of these ships usually
cannot harm a capital ship, they can carry special ordnance that could
harm them.

        Most programs I use on Windows can read EPS; once you\'ve got it in
as a picture, converting it should be relatively easy.
        DXF is Drawing Exchange Format ... a standardized format for
exchanging vector and CAD-type files. Again, there\'s decent support under
Windows at least for using this as a standard.

Possibly the largest PAW ever built.  But nice effect though, everytime

Didn\'t we just have this discussion a few months ago?  I don\'t think that we
had consensus, but the following stick in my mind:

INS Imperial Navy Ship
ISS Imperial Star Ship or Imperial Space Ship (i.e., any non-navy ship
registered to a member world of the Imperium); non-navy ships could also
follow the conventions of their registry worlds:  ESS Efate Star Ship; M/V
(I don\'t know what it means, but it looks cool); shipname Maru; etc.
IISS Imperial Interstellar Scout Service ship

Yep, even on normally hospitable (terrestrial) worlds, people died in 
droves where the population was above the planet\'s ecological carrying 
capacity and/or the infrastructure didn\'t support them any more.  There\'s 
some thoroughly lurid and descriptive text in the TNE rulebook regarding 
this phenomenon.  Basically, all them keen, uppity, cosmopolitan city

[the idea of beginning \'careers\' one term earlier for people DURING the 
Collapse is postulated]

That\'d hardly be a fun time to roleplay, but if you\'re going to do a 
detailed NPC, 13 years old is a good place to start (one term earlier 
than the traditional starting age, 17).  Naturally, the list of available 
career paths would be somewhat shorter...

I intend to see it, but I\'m already wincing from what they told us in
the TV special earlier this week. 

They use *braking rockets* and then *hover* over the cities? Yeah,
right.

A quote from the "Special" earlier this week:

"They\'re the new tenants, we\'re the cockroaches."

In other words, I must assume that they want the planet intact.

Besides, given the howlers that they were practically *bragging* about,
it\'s a bit much to expect them to even *realize* you can throw rocks.

You got lucky. I\'ve been on systems where the barely literate kept
showing up. In *droves*. And not only were their messages almost
impossible to decipher, but they got upset if you tried to suggest
ways to make their messages more intelligible.

Of course, I\'ve been BBSing since 81....

Remember, this is just how the infection *started*. You do need an
explanation of how these highly trained people made the goof. After
that the virus can handle it by itself.

A real world example:

The particular outbreak of bubonic plague that most think of when you
mention "The Black Death" got "started" when the folks beseiged in a
city (or perhaps it was the beseigers) used their catapults to throw
some dead bodies over the city wall. From there, it spread on its own
in the crowded conditions (both a beseiged city *and* the camps of the
beseigers had *appalling* sanitation back then). Once some cases turned
into pneumonic plague (you get infected when an infected person
*breathes* nearby) the seige fell apart. And the people departing
spread it all over Europe.

If nobody had had that bright idea about the catapult, it\'d have been a
minor outbreak. 

Likewise if nobody had the "bright idea" of trying to figure out the
code *now*, the virus wouldn\'t have gotten such a rapid initial spread.

AN halibut.  I picked him out of thousands.  I didn\'t like the others-- 
they were much too flat.

Oh, I\'m sorry, I\'ll come in again...

INTERREGNUM n., pl. -REGNUMS or -REGNA [ L < inter-, between + -regnum, 
REIGN ]  1.  an interval between two successive reigns, when the country 
has no sovereign  2.  a suspension of governmental or administrative 
functions; period without the usual ruler, governor, etc.  3.  any break 
in a series or in a continuity, interval  (from Webster\'s New World 
Dictionary)

And I still can\'t do crosswords worth a damn.

Right!  If it weren\'t for such petty planetary squabbles, we\'d already 
have gone into space!

Actually, here\'s the real tragedy:  This list is subscribed to, read, and 
posted to, by many of the minds that have either been large influences on 
Traveller in the past, are now, and/or will continue to be in the 
future.  As such, I can\'t help but fear that the very game itself has 
been irrevocably tainted by the foul, malignant influence of this whole 
shameful Jesse Helms thread.  The seed has been planted, and it cannot be 
dug out.  We\'re going to suffer it again and again on down the line, ad 
infinitum, ad absurdum, ad nauseam, just like those darned Hiver corn 
dogs, now that it\'s already received such treatment.  Mark my words:  
Jesse Helms will surface in a way we least expect.  We\'ll be darn lucky 
if he only resurfaces as one of those vile annelids that the Hivers use 
in their "corn dogs."

I, for my part, am darn sorry to have been one of the instigating 
influences, and I wholeheartedly, and without reservation, apologize for 
my involvement.

I\'m probably not going to change my .sig, though.

I\'m probably jumping on a bandwagon here, but doesn\'t the term 
\'auxiliary\' refer to support ships such as tankers, transports, and the 
like, which are typically NON-combatants?  Or is there perhaps a separate 
term for these non-combatants (such as "Support Ships")?

Primarily rules-wise, but also background-wise? Instead of saying that 
the virus wiped out technology and the Imperium how hard would it be 
to change the background to say that the more powerful sides simply 
beat each other into the stone age and that the Reformation Coalition 
formed in order to defend its members  from fragments of the Imperium raiding
their planets for resources?

Not really.  Coast Guard is also responsible for Navigational Aids --
clearly a concern of DOT.  Canada Coast Guard was transferred from DOT to
Fisheries and Oceans this year (I shall not speculate on why).

Question: Are there orbital navaids in traveller? Who maintains them --
planetary authorities (Orbit Guard?), Starport Authorities?.  Also, in
Canada (IIRC) Coast Guard coordinates search and rescue for Canada\'s SAR
areas, even if other resourses (Navy, Merchant Ships, etc.) do the actual
rescue.

US Merchant seaman picked up by CG Destroyer in North Atlantic after torpedo

offered to "throw him back until the Navy gets here".  Was restrained...

Yes: the aquatic Schalli.  They\'re covered in the main TNE rulebook.  TNE
also gave much more detail (which revulsed some, amused others) about the
Ithklur, the race providing the bulk of the Hivers\' military (see "Aliens
of the Rim: Hivers and Ithklur").

(BTW: This is coming from a guy who has all three series of StarBlazers on
      videotape, and all of the Space Cruiser Yamato movies I can find)

The PSG (Pseudo-Scientific Gobbeldygook) explanation for the Wave Motion Gun
is that it\'s the largest tachyon acellerator ever built (not counting the
ones in the Andromeda-class battleships, of course).  Presumably, it fires
some type of tachyons that have a relatively large cross-section for
interaction with normal matter.

Back before the "Laser Limit" was established, I worked out that the best
Traveller model for the Wave Motion Gun was a laser.  In FF&S, there\'s no
limit to the discharge energy you can have for a laser, and as the energy
increases, so does the penetration.  A laser sized for a battleship\'s main
weapon would have enough damage and penetration to pierce a small moon.
It would also require a crew of only one to operate the laser.

I\'m not sure.  Were the Ithklur and the Prt? in the origianl books?  I\'d 
imagine so but probably in more of a passing reference than they got 
treated in "sneaks and geaks."

The Schalli are probably better detailed in Path of Tears.

Regency source book has decent, not extensive but decent, information on 
Vargr, and Aslan\'s, they also do the Joes and the Darin\'s but lets face 
it both of these are just human sub-species.

If you\'ve got a sence of humor "Sneaks and Geeks" is an excellent source 
book.  Unlike the old Traveller alien supplements where they told you 
everything in "Sneaks and Geeks" there\'s still a certian amount of 
mystery about the aliens, which I think is better.

2)  Curiosity:  Involved in one of the largest space battles over one of

Well, they did write a lot about the Ithklur, a minor race within the 
Hive Federation.  The 1 and only alien book written prior to GDW\'s 
demise was Aliens of the Rim, Vol. 1 Hivers and Ithklur.  The Ithklur 
had been mentioned previously in CT Alien Module 7, Hivers, but the 
new book expanded on the Ithklur.  Aliens of the Rim wasn\'t one of 
the better TNE supplements though.  A lot of what was written 
contraadicted other sources on the Hivers, and I thought the Ithklur, 
as portrayed were a bit silly...philosopher warriors.

As I recall, there was a really dumb joke about corn dogs running 
through it...

Oops...forgot about the Schalli...

The Schalli are actually most heavily covered in Path of Tears, if 
I\'m not mistaken.  Count me amongst the later on Ha-Has and Idiocy...
I\'m not a big guy on \'canon\', but it seems kind of silly to 
contradict previous sources just for the sake of a few jokes...which 
is what Aliens of the Rim did...

Derek,

I usually see eye to eye with you but not on this one.  I have no 
problem with somebody not fleshing out all the details of a universe and 
indeed prefer it that way, but how do you portray an alien race if you 
don\'t have a lot of detail about the race...

Actually, as I recall, someone from GDW (maybe Dave Nilsen?) 
explained their outlook on Sneaks and Geeks by saying that TNE wasn\'t 
about being able to play aliens (other than Schalli, which is an inherent 
contradiction).  They thought that the previous alien modules had 
allowed players to gallavant all over the map in the other stellar 
empires playing K\'Kree, or Vargr, or such.  (I personally don\'t see 
why this is a bad thing, but read on)...

Well, gee that\'s great, but first of all GDW wrote the first set of Alien 
modules, and started the trend in the first place.  Second of all, if you\'re 
not going to offer details about the aliens in the "canon"-ical 
universe, then why have aliens at all...  If Sneaks and Geeks is the 
only source 1 has on the Hivers, they\'re going to wind up playing 
them as humans in really funny suits...  Finally, who gives a rip if 
players aren\'t playing anywhere near where GDW was developing the RC 
section of the universe in New Era...  What\'s wrong with playing an 
alien as a significant NPC or PC?  It\'s more challenging than playing 
a human (at least to do it welI), and can add a lot of science 
fiction flavor to a campaign...  And finally after all, it is the 
players game...

IMNSHO, 2 of the best books ever written for any version of the game 
were DGP\'s alien modules for MegaTraveller.  It gave great detail 
about the race, their background, their history, heck even examples 
of how to role play them in various situations...  IG would do well 
to look at the DGP books as an example of how to write future books 
or supplements about particular aliens, or contract with Roger Sanger 
to finish the series...

Brilliant Lances is fun, and really quick to play once (a) you figure out the
rules, and (b) fill out the data sheet.  Shalom & I solved (a) by repeated
rereading, and I\'ve solved (b) by saving all the sheets I fill out (and
filling out sheets when I\'m bored).

This is an excellent game in terms of game mechanics.  The editing is
terrible, but once you wade through it the game plays fast.

Oh yeah, the visual appeal of using Rafm\'s spaceship miniatures is hard to
beat.  I\'ve also made little planets and \'bogey\' black blobs.  And if you
don\'t like using miniatures (or can\'t afford it) the counters look good.

I found Battle Rider a good game, but less fun than Brilliant Lances. 
Probably because I was less involved with a fleet than with my little
crippled scoutship.  However, it plays fast.

I\'ve bought and played every Traveller product since the game was first
published.  (Yes, I _do_ have gray hair.)  These are the best space combat
games I\'ve played, ever.

See my take has alway\'s been give me enough that I can use and after that 
I\'ll take it myself, this way there\'s something non-canon about the 
alien, all it takes is one mischevious player to peak through the book 
and say something and the aliens darkest inner secret is ruined forever. 
 Ie. If a player read the Aslan source book and determined the Aslan 
refuesed to fight between 4 and 5 on weekdays because it was tea time.  
The\'d use that to their advantage, if they just never saw the Aslan 
between those times they might never figure out somethings up.

I agree with you here.  I never had a problem with day triping across the

I think aliens have a great potential for comedy, of course when I gm we 
usually spend 1/4 of time with tears rolling out of our eyes from 
laughing.  But beyond that aliens should never be humans in funny suits, 
they\'re, well, alien.  But if you can\'t publish a book with a little 
humour in it people are taking it to serously.  I\'ve read the Digest 
Group Publications, "MT Vilani and Vargr" module, I don\'t know if there\'s 
an earlier source book on this material but really it\'s so dry and stale, 
I\'d have looked at the author and said, nice try, the deatils are there 
but can\'t you make it more interesting and less like a text book?

There\'s lots of great infomation contained within these pages but it\'s so 
friggin boring that you need someone to duct tape you to a chair and keep

Related to navigational aids, there are also functions like icebreaking. 
As for why we were transfered, there were a number of reasons, but the
driving one is a rationalization of Marine resources and the resulting
costs savings.  There isn\'t going to be much left of Transport Canada
(DOT).

The Canadian rescue coordination centres are staffed by both Department of
Defence and Coast Guard personnel.  We (the Coast Guard) do indeed
coordinate all marine SAR incidents.  As for resources, pretty well all
the air resources deployed will be military.  Most of the marine will be
ours.

I\'ve seen ISR somewhere (Imperial Ship(?) Registry -- was it part of 
the PBM?

Incidentally, M/V stands for Motor Vessel (hereabouts anyway). Now 
there\'s an idea: a diesel-powered starship. Anyone care to try 
designing one of those?

Granted...although when a lot of the canon is written to set up jokes 
about corn dogs...there\'s a problem.  If I want a book of humor, I\'ll 
look in the humor section of the nearest Waldenbooks...where I can 
get better and more humor for a lot cheaper than I bought Aliens of 
the Rim for...

I don\'t think there are any such dark secrets.  Even if the players 
know the basic motivations of a race as a whole, they aren\'t going to 
know what the NPC\'s motivations are in the immediate context.  About 
the only 1 I can recall was the hints that the Aslan are a minor race...in the 
original CT module, later confirmed by DGP\'s Rats & Cats.  And if 
you\'ve got a "mischievous" player digging through your sourcebooks, 
that\'s a different problem.  I do think that game companies need to 
be more careful labelling section for referees only though, as I\'ve 
commented in the past.

My problem is that this is a main justification given for being vague 
about the Hivers and Ithklur...

I guess what I\'m saying is that any GM with any imagination at all 
can come up with a half fleshed out alien.  Give me 1 that seems 
living and breathing and I\'m a lot happier...

Granted, it doesn\'t do to take yourself so seriously, but at the 
price that RPG supplements run nowadays, I want fairly hard 
information, not jokes about corn dogs...

As for me, I don\'t mind interesting and I don\'t mind humor.  Cliches 
and puns priced at $14, I do mind...

The Vargr yes, Vilani no...

I guess I didn\'t find it to be all that dry reading, but maybe others 
do...

Perhaps the best approach might be a dual approach.  Give a little 
bit of detail in something like the upcoming Alien volume...and give 
exhaustive detail on the major races in future supplements.  Some 
people like the detail of Rats & Cats or Bogs & Dogs, apparently you 
don\'t...  

I\'ve seen a lot more complimentary comments about the DGP volumes 
than Sneaks and Geeks, on the list in the past though...even amongst 
TNE devotees...

Stu,

I agree.  Give me lots o\' detail on the background stuff.  I\'ll take it 
or leave it, change this and that, but if I had my druthers the starting 
point (the material provided by the publisher) would be comprehensive.

Oh, God, no!  We don\'t want people getting outside of the published areas 
of the game setting!  Then people would stop buying our products!  That 
would be horrid! 

Ugh.  Instead of responding to the market and providing the desired 
material, they\'d rather discourage people from pursuing a legitimate use 
of the far future setting.  Sigh.  I\'m sorry to hear that was their policy.

Neither CT, or MT allowed players to be aliens, or at least didn\'t
have any rules about it.  YOu had to buy the Alien modules, where
they gave the rules for generating aliens.  I think GDW would have
released more books about aliens, except they went out of business.

I think IG is planning on releasing a book o.f Aliens, which hopefully
will be good.  

I had mixed feelings about Sneeks and Geeks, I liked the Hiver part,
I thought they presented them quite well.  It gave several different
view points, and the GM could pick the one  he most wanted, or 
thought was best.  The Ithklur kind of annoyed me with some of the 
jokes.  It wasn\'t that they were jokes, just that the refered to 20th
Century Americal life too much, of course I wouldn\'t have
understood any references to 11th Century Vilani life. :(

I thought their basic output was kind of intersting, really violent,
but without all the hate and rage that humans require to get violent.
They were violent because they liked it.  

Well enough rambling.

You know, such standards-setting is very much a part of the real world, 
and, as you point out, often is bungled.  This would explain why the 
Imperium is still using silicon-based computers. ;-)  

"ISO (Imperial Standards Organization) Policy 5400, Section 435 clearly 
states that all computers must:
1) use silicon chips as their basis,
2) operate using the ISO-686 Processor as the main CPU, and
3) contain at least one communication channel capable of accepting data 
and running it as code without human intervention, and regardless of the 
logic behind such action."

This explains a lot! :)

See this is where you\'re wrong.  I liked the detail, I didn\'t like the 
way it was presented.  Perhaps it was because I was in university at the 
time and I hated reading text books.  I think that if you\'re going to 
present material that is that serious you have to do something to lighten 
it up.  Humerous stories, things that happened when they were first 
encoutered, you don\'t have to do this, lets face it the people buying 
traveller supplements are reading them because they want to not because 
they have to.  I guess what I\'m trying to say is detail is fine I like 
detail, detail with out substance (entertainment) is not.

When I went to university I had a number of Prof\'s.  Some, the ones who 
could liven up the class with personal tales, pictures and humor were 
extremely popular.  Hell it was damn near impossible to get into their 
classes and as a rule their students learned and remembered more of the 
knowledge they had been imparted.  Then there were those other Prof\'s the 
ones who took their disipline as if it were the most important thing on 
the planet, a course that if you didn\'t take god would cast you out of 
heaven and condem you to an eternity in hell.  These prof\'s had no 
stories, no pictures and nothing to relate about the subject other than 
dry facts.  These were the guy\'s who 1/2 the class was sleeping and the 
other have was putting the finishing touches on their suicide notes.

I\'m not saying GDW was right with "Sneaks and Geeks" and I\'m not saying 
DGP was wrong with "Dogs and Bogs."  They both are extremely valid 
studies of alien races conducted by different people who wanted to 
emphasize different points.  And the both give you enough information 
that you could play the alien races involved.  Well with the possible 
exception of the Hiver\'s but they\'re just to weird anyways.

I think the only publication that should never have been put out was 
"Secret of the Ancients."  But that\'s a personal thing that involved 
destroying a really good traveller campaign.

I should have been a little clearer on the ammunition.  The fin-stabilized
flechette is 5.5mm in diameter and is fired in a discarding sabot with a
diameter of 15mm.  Barrel length is 1.2m and is not rifled.  Length of the
projectile is unknown, nor is overall weight of each round (the flechette
itself is 36g and made of tungsten).  Recoil is supposed to be equivilent
to a .358 sporting rifle.  The 40mm penetration at 800m is in "armour
steel".  Steyr also makes something called the 5.56mm Steyr ACR which fires
a 1.6x41mm flechette in a discarding sabt from a standard 5.56mm-style
cartridge.  It has a similar muzzle velocity.

The AMR is relatively new and is currently under evaluation in a number of
countries.  I found it in "Military Small Arms of the 20th Century-- 6th
Edition" by DBI books.  The AMR is actually listed in the Automatic Rifles
section and not in the section entitled Anti-Tank Rifles (this is scarey).
Its primary purpose is for the destruction of sensitive enemy equipment at
long ranges.

This is a pretty good book for those with an interest in modern battlefield
weapons.  It has an exploded view of a G11 on the front cover, right next
to an actual photograph of the weapon and its 4.73mm caseless ammunition.
According to the book, the G11 is currently in its 15th prototype stage and
nearing perfection.  This weapon is absolutely amazing!

No kidding.  I think it would be really nice to be able to show

Yeah, well, I just read a science update that says the Big Domes at MIT
are trying to make a laser out of excitons, you know the space that is

Wait a minute...what about the Andromeda (you know the computerized one
everyone hated----watch THAT get taken over by Virus through its passive
sensor array)?  It had TWO wave-motion guns (course they would be parallel
mounted).

Is it really supposed to be only in the past?  I haven\'t even finished 
reading TNE /once/ let alone many times, nor have I read any of the other 
published TNE materials.  Yet, it seems to me that such things would

Really!  I had no idea.  So, for instance, getting your kid apprenticed 
to (for example) a cobbler would be seen as a good thing for the family, 
even though it would take a pair of hands from the field?  I guess things 
don\'t change too much after all.

They have not died down.  Everyone\'s still recovering from their 4th of 
July hangovers.  Actually I\'m still recovering from my 1st of July

I grant you that...  A few more sidebars, a few more 1st person 
experiences...  Personal opinion, remembering my days in college 
back in the middle ages, having to read textbooks turned me off of 
reading anything heavier than the comics for about 2 years after I 
finished college.  But I grant you...more examples, more first person 
narrative, a less dry writing style (not necessarily as over the top as 
Sneaks & Geeks).  I found it an interesting read, but I can see where 
somebody might find it dry reading...

On the other hand, Sneaks and Geeks seemed to be more about telling 
stupid jokes than describing aliens, so I think somewhere in the 
middle is probably best...

I think it was nice for Marc to actually flesh out the mystery of the 
Ancients, but I have to admit that I\'ve never run this 1 with the 
group, and probably never will...  I could see where it could wreak 
havoc with an existing campaign if you tried to run it well into the 
campaign (particularly if your campaign includes a lot of mysteries 
re. the Ancients)...

Unless of course, somebody decided not to be so worried about

   One of the worlds designed by a member of the TNE-Pocket list included
a world with a tainted atmosphere.  When the collapse took out the filter
factory, the population didn\'t die off.  They just started dying much younger.
Death usually occured around age 30 due to massive lung failure.

  The US Coast Guard is technically part of the Transportation Department.
It is *transferred* to the DoD in time of war.  It can also \'loan\' units
to the US Navy for limited engagements.  Coast Guard units saw action in
Viet Nam.  They they provided a \'Blue Water\' Navy with experience in coastal
and river actions.  This included lessons in how to board and search small
vessels.  US Coast Guard units again saw service prior to the Gulf War.  
Once again, they provided instruction in how to board and search vessels 
for hidden contraban.

  The Sector Admiral sez "Go There!", and you go!  Such smaller vessels
could easily be pressed into fleet service as tenders, scouts, and of
course, boarding and searching smaller vessels.  You don\'t send your 
Battleship over to investigate a trader that may be packed to the airlocks
with nuclear warheads, just waiting for a capital ship to get close...

>I expect that there\'d be some intense rivalry between the two halves of
>the Navy. Both would look down on the other side. 
  Of course.  The local patrol units would see themselves as doing "The Real
Work", protecting the citizens.  They would probably see more action than
a \'Ship of the Line\', except during war.  
  The Captital Ship units would view the \'coastal\' units as \'kids playing
around in toy boats.\'

   Of the top of my head, sure.  The Rebellion got really, really nasty.
Several factions said, "If I can\'t have it, neither can you."  Then the various
alien groups, Vargr, Aslan, K\'Kree, smelled blood and attacked.  The various 
post Imperium groups decided that they wanted the aliens having it even less,
so they joined forces just long enough to attack the invaders.  Major butt
kicking took place *all over*.  All sides fought till they were forced
to throw bags of BBs out their airlocks in path of attacking ships. :-)

That\'s what happens when you forget books and use hand computers, which
require a power source!

Seriously, one of the problems I have with \'online\' resources is that I
haven\'t found a decent reader that I can curl up with beside a campfire.  Too

True..

True again.  This gets off the topic of the effects of the collapse, but 
I think in the future computers for such purposes will better emulate 
their non-virtual counterparts.  Computers for use in getting 
white-collar work done (ie, work at a desk) have come to emulate the desk 
to some degree.  In the future, especially the Far Future, I believe 
there will be computers available that will better emulate the 
human-magazine and human-book interfaces.  That\'s the only way I can see 
them replacing books and magazines, anyway.

"Hand Computers" as described in Traveller just won\'t work for that.  
Maybe IG or someone should come up with a pseudo-design for such a thing 
and include it in the Catalog or a JTAS article.

Actually, we aren\'t really obsessed with safety at any cost.  Just look at
the daily traffic carnage!  Look at how people react when lower speed limits
are enforced (which _do_ reduce injuries when everyone obeys them).  Look at
th reaction to Alar, lead miniature figures, BT...

People tend to get worried about big splashy disasters, or \'hazards\' that
some national TV reporter has chosen to publicize.  The day-to-day hazards
are ignored (or even encouraged).

I would say that we are going through an avoidance of responsibility phase. 
(At least, I _hope_ it\'s a phase).  Why else would a pack-a-day smoker
campaign against nuclear power?

If you like, I\'ll try to dig up some material on relative risks.

There is a big difference between the useful, insightful, and useable alien
modules of DGP, and the slapstick, irreverant, slap in the face of GDW\'s
_H&I_.

I had a player who bought me a copy of H&I so he could play hivers. (He\'d
encountered some NPC hivers, and liked what he saw). He read through H&I,
and found that he didn\'t have any real feel for hivers from it... and he
then read Alien Module _: Hivers (too lazy to look up the # right now)and
understood what it meant to be a hiver. My other players who have read both
have had the same problem. All of them think the CT alien modules were a
little dry. Those who\'ve read H&I and Hivers find contradictions.

***All my players were offended by the San*claws religion of the Ithklur...
it turned out to be just too "non-travelleresque" for my group. ***

Alines need to at least feel like they are more than men in suits. Those
who can\'t make an alien feel like more than a man in suit don\'t get to play
one. Even part vilani characters require the player to read the player\'s
section of V&V, if they are to play in my games. It adds to the
versimilitude of the game. Something the later GDW attempts at aliens
lacks. The Ithklur concept was ok, but the handling, symbology, and bad
puns did no favors for traveller. Even the old JTAS article "Contact:
Virush" had more on how to play a virush than H&I had for EITHER.

Navaids would be maintained by the IISS and/or local authorities. SAR,

About the two ideas above...From my friends who are/have been in the Navy
and the Coast Guard, Navy ships are required to have Coast Guard liason
officers who conduct all boarding/search and seizure type stuff, because
the\'re the ones who have the authority to do so.  The navy stops the
vessels, and the Coasties go aboard it.

Also, I haven\'t seen much animosity between the two services from the
people I know in them.  The Navy and the Coast Guard simply perform
different functions, and that\'s how all the people I\'ve talked to see it
(I\'m researching both, with the intent of joining one or the other).

Cool!  It\'d be neat to have a fully-fleshed-out hand computer such as 
this for use in the game.  I\'m sure you know all about them, but I\'d like 
to hear more so I can add your idea to my Imperium! :) (If IG doesn\'t do 
something like this, perhaps you could write a JTAS article?)

Are they notebook-sized, and you do something similar to flipping a 
page (perhaps, touching the upper-right-hand corner?) to get it to 
display the next page?  Or do you say, "flip page?"  

Would you say the display is very much like ink-and-paper in the way it 
looks, or is it more like a LCD?  

Can they download information from afar, or do they need a physical link 
to the computer being accessed?  If the former, can they be used as 
communicators?  Can you link them together into a temporary network, 
allowing every user to see what is on some sort of shared display, which 
they can all interact with?  What sort of range do they have?

Are they expandable at all?  Can you hook in stadard sensors so they 
become multi-purpose for exploration parties, for instance?  Any other 
optional add-ons (ie, translation programs)?

Of course, it\'d be nice to have the exact weight and dimensions (plus, 
weight dimensions and price of optional add-ons, if any).

Geez, I\'m just full of questions tonight! :)  Sorry if I\'m overwhelming 
you, but I think this is a technology which can be explored a lot 
more...even without a lot of hand-waving over how things work.

I\'ve never read H&I, but I have read the CT stuff and the MT stuff 
(though I no longer own the MT/DGP stuff).  Personally, I\'d like to see 
somethin along the lines of the CT Alien Modules, but with much more 
information.  As for writing style, making it come alive would be nice.  
I don\'t mean the copious use of humor.  I mean that it would be nice to 
have some anecdotes from humans who have experience with the race, as 
well as some stuff written from the perspective of the race in question.

They were offended by the fact that religion was included, or were they 
offended by the way the religion was treated in the book?

Them poor Aslan.  They probably have designators based on the owning

I still find that the DGP sourcebooks are the best resources for the 
first three races you mentioned.  The Regency Sourcebook is, 
unfortunately, my only resource (besides library data) on the Darrians.

It really helps to not take it, or yourself, seriously while reading 
"Aliens of the Rim."  For all of the bad jokes (with which life is full 
of, unfortunately), it is still a good resource if for no other reason 
than the player-readable sections give your PCs just enough rope 
(information) to hang themselves with.  I also like the way they treated 
that darn original text on Hivers (Hiver Mechnod Photo Hello) which I 
first saw as MT library data, and could never really stomach as 
originally presented (no offense intended to the original authors-- how 
am I to know that they didn\'t intend it that way?).

Actually, I\'ve found that the \'bad jokes\' can serve to keep PCs on their 
toes, or trip them up.  Imagine the looks on their faces when you tell 
them that they\'re having their butts kicked by Santa Claws.

What?  And start a new round of us arguing?  We\'ll be disagreeing about 
what we agreed about!  I mean, has it been settled, and is their any true 
agreement on what common points, if any, were reached?  For my part, I\'ve 
totally ignored the Rocks debate, instead focusing my energies on the 
Virus debate.  Although being pro-Virus, I have found some points of 
agreement with the anti-Virus crowd, or perhaps they\'ve found some with 
me.  Who knows, and who wants to commit something like that to record?  
Since we can\'t get agreement in either camp on even what exactly Virus is 
(some people have no idea what the canon is, others aren\'t sure, and 
still others ARE sure, but only accept it with certain personal 
reservations or modifications), how can we logically draw up a list of 
conclusions that have been reached?

I\'m not really sure that either debate has been solved, or is even 
solvable, considering all of the variables.  Or perhaps I\'m just being 
defeatist.  If I were to write the FAQ entry, I\'d say that the anti-Virus 
crowd dismiss the possibility of the Virus phenomenon because it does not 
obey conventional wisdom in computer science.  The pro-Virus crowd 
supports the possibility of the Virus phenomenon on the basis that it is 
something that the paradigms of "Program" or "Data" cannot be applied to, 
and therefore the conventional wisdom of computer science does not apply 
to it, as it actually has its basis in silicon-based life rather than the 
artificial systems which it subverts.  The anti-Virus camp, extrapolating 
from the evolution of contemporary computer systems the probable 
properties of such devices in the 57th century, and citing laws of 
mathematics and computer science which are immutable (or at least don\'t 
seem likely to change even over such a long span of time) and therefore 
applicable to 57th century computers, argue that even such capable 
systems, extensively integrated with other devices and manufactured 
according to widely adopted standards (the Imperial Data Package) are so 
unlikely to even execute, unexamined and without human input, the program 
code or data which comprises the invading Virus, that the possibility of 
such a Virus causing the Collapse is not worth considering.

The pro-Virus camp, proceeding from the argument that any assertion on 
the nature of future technology cannot be proved with sufficient 
certainty to dismiss the possibility of Virus, argues that the computers 
of the 57th century are actually an ideal environment for the 
development and sustenance of Virus which, even in its primary 
generation, had a deep and intimate working knowledge of all Imperial 
designed computing systems (derived from the IDP) and the ability to 
learn to subvert those systems not manufactured in accordance with it.  
Such a phenomenon inflicted on the societies present in Charted Space, 
whose infrastructures were primarily high-tech with massive computer 
integration, could easily have caused such a massive, destructive event 
as the Collapse.

Of course, if I were to write such an entry for the FAQ, I\'d be darn sure 
to note that I\'m ultimately not speaking for anybody but myself on this 
issue.

"Somebody STOP me!" :P

Never let it be said that I discouraged others from coming up with new 
Traveller material. :)

Seriously, I think a lot of the basic equipment for Traveller could 
benefit from an article-length treatment.  The Travellers\' Digest and 
Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society did some of this, but there\'s 
still more to be done.  Plus, I think what has already been covered 
(including hand computers, which were covered in a Digest issue) can be 
re-done in light of changes in real-world common technology (ie, PDA\'s, 
electronic organizers, etc.).  Technology has been changing so fast that 
the "far future" ideas of just a decade ago seem hopelessly dated.  

In addition, a lot of items and technologies need explanation for those 
unfamiliar with them.  I don\'t mind the occasional hand-wave about the 
underlying theory of their operation, but the human-machine interface 
should be explained, as well as the range of uses it can be put to, what 
happens when you activate it, etc.  A good example of this is the recent 
discussion of missile effects.  If that stuff could be nailed down, I 
think it would be as useful to Travellers as the (also recently 
discussed) comparative size chart.  
 
In summary, I\'d like to see Traveller equipment detailed in such a way as 
to assist referees in their task of making the Traveller universe come 
alive - become real - for their players.

I\'m willing to do work on this where I have the required knowledge.  But 
there is a lot of stuff (like, oh, just about any weaponry you care to 
name) that I can\'t say I fully understand.  :(

hours, the jacket executed the "return to master" program upon which

Or Canadian enough.  I hear it was imensly popular down under too.  
Sechelt is about 30-40 minutes North-West of Gibsons, Gibson\'s is about a 
35 minute ferry ride from Horseshoe Bay and Horseshoe Bay is about 30 
minutes out of North Van.  Which, due to the construction work on the

again in a month for some fresh peaches.  How did this trip come about?  
I asked my wife on Friday morning if she\'d like some fresh cherries, she

SC isn\'t so much a relgion as a prophet.  SC is the enlightened warrior 
who founded the Four Fold way.  If you sit and read the four fold way 
it\'s actually a practical and interesting thing.  The gag is that 
San*claws (?) wore a bright red pointy cap with a white pom-pom on the 
top and white fur around the edge.  See the classic "Coca Cola" santa 
claus suit for an idea as what this thing looks like.  The Ithklur are 
absolutly delighted that we "humans" know who their enlightened warrior 
is.

"San*claws!  You human\'s know about San*claws!?!"

"Of course, red hat, jolly fellow Santa Claus."

"Remarkable!  You human\'s truely are a wonderous race."

The name and the hat are a gag explained away as remarkable coincidence. 
 The four fold way is a philosophy that governs the lives of all Ithklur 
and honestly there\'s something in there that\'s incidiously likeable.

Trillion Credit Squadron rules state: that once a system\'s navy has been defeated, 100 weapon points will force a surrender. The 
terms are; each citizen pays an annual tribute, and the navy gets access to the starport. The world gets to keep their laws and 
culture. The trade off is that, the populaton does not face extintion or the invading navy is\'nt destroyed by Barbarians flying crop

Any relation to the eight-fold path of Buddhism?  (Is that right?  I may 
be getting religions mixed up....did some study of religions a while 
back, but I tend to get my wires crossed on them (sigh).)

Oh, gawd!

[sigh]  I liked this sort of thing in the game Paranoia (which had a 
section titled "Insanity Clause" and sub-titled "As in, "Don\'t you 
believe Insanity Clause?""), where it was appropriate and in the spirit 
of the game.  I have no objection to using humor in Traveller (it\'s a 
dry, dry campaign that has no humor), but there are limits.

Hmmm.  Could be worth checking into this supplement.  Perhaps IG will 
take the best of the material on that race, and do something more 
appropriate with it.

I dont think the ALiens playe TcR Squadron, and besides, a planet
surrenders when it surrenders, not based on an arbitrary number of weapons
in orbit.

Depends on whether the aliens want to repopulate the planet or not, 
doesn\'t it?  If you fly in with a massive technological advantage and 
wish to claim an occupied planet as your own, it seems safer to me to 
render the occupants as helpless as possible before moving in rather than 
trying to keep a relatively undamaged populace under control after you\'ve 
moved in.  Destroying all major cities, centers of production, and 
military targets seems like a good way to accomplish the goal to me.  But 
then, I\'ve never actually planned an invasion of another planet. :)

I guess a case could be made for a treaty, given that the indigent 
population would agree to cooperate with you to the extent of giving up 
land and rights, and policing their own population for those who would 
break the treaty.  It seems to me, though, that it would be difficult for 
any government to control all its people and keep them from making 
offensive moves against the invading force.

A situation similar to Isreal/Palastine would occur, or so it seems to me.

How would this work?  Would electrical pulses (or heat/cold?) sent to 
various areas of the object cause expansion or contraction of the 
materials present at that location, causing a form of movement similar

A canadian company is currently developing a flexable microchip for 
computer id-cards (ie. visa, driver\'s liscence, etc.)  These computer 
chips would store money in an electronic format.  You\'d swipe the card 
put in 100 buck and go out and spend it.  You\'d need a pin code to put 
money into the card not to take it out.  I\'m not sure how far along this 
project it though.

On the map of Core Sector, it identifies 25 worlds as Sylean.  These worlds
are all on a j2 route.  Other than Capital (which, oddly, is the furthest
Spinward of the SF worlds), the SF has three Hi-Pop worlds listed: Khuir
(2513, Starport B), Ispumer (2615, Starport E), and Markasher (3115,
Starport E, no water).

There is, however, a high population world just two parsecs rimward of
capital (Ase, 2219, Starport B, no water).

I feel the need to point out that these starport and population levels are
from the Second Survey, but they provide a fairly good guide to the
conditions at the birth of the Imperium.  Something presented the Sylean
Federation a real problem to spinward, preventing expansion in that
direction until the TL12 breakthrough.  Perhaps some of the other
interstellar governments Mr. Miller teased us with in his request for
insignia are sitting in the region around Fornal (1715).

I also wonder about two worlds with hi-pop and type E starports.  If this
was the case at the year 0, It leaves the industrial output of the Imperium
in the hands of two worlds!  This would make acquiring more industrial
worlds a priority.  There are five hi-pop worlds in the immediate Imperial area.

Also, the Imperium would want a "buffer zone" around Capital, to insure that
an unfriendly force would not be able to penetrate in on jump.

Any thoughts?

A neat idea!

Here\'s an interesting power-related tidbit from the latest Business Week 
(July 15, 1996, p 86):

Fill \'Er Up - With Sugar and Enzymes
====================================

Pour sugar into a car\'s gasoline tank today, and it\'s sure to gum up the 
works. But tomorow, dumping sugar into the gas tank may be just the 
ticket for cleaner air and cheaper fuel.  Sugars and starches, from 
glucose and dextrose down to the cellulose in grass mowings and other 
plant waste, would be converted into hydrogen, perhaps the least 
polluting fuel of all.
The secret to this magical transformation: two deep-sea enzymes.  They 
come from bacteria that live near the volcanic vents in the deepest, 
darkest abysses of te sea.  Unlike enzymes that evolved under normal 
conditions, the new enzymes have unusual properties.  For example, one of 
them can donate an electron to a chemical reaction.  As a result, the 
enzyme pair can pluck atoms from glucose molecules and reassemble them 
into hydrogen molecules.
If the process can be scaled up, "we could obtain large volumes of 
hydrogen fuel from renewable resources," says Jonathan Woodward, a 
researcher at Oak Ridge Natinal Laboratory.  He works with biochemist 
Michael Danson at Britain\'s University of Bath.

===============

Does anyone see any application for this in the Traveller universe?

   Myomers. Electricity makes them contract just like muscles.

Very true.  But, I still find it useful to have "book" prices to use as a 
baseline.  Then I discount or increase the prices from there.

Something I\'d add, but perhaps it is too obvious to mention: an expansion 
port for additional accessories.

So, it has 4 chip ports.  Not unreasonable.

Nice options, too.

Thanks for putting this together.  It\'s going into my ever-growing file 
of TML posts. :)

If I may, I\'d like to list some accessories which may be purchased and 
hooked to the expansion port (each has an expansion port in turn, so may 
be "daisy chained," but that just makes the unit heavier and more bulky 
to lug around if overdone), and also some chips, briefly: 

[note: this is all completely off-the-cuff, so isn\'t going to be too 
detailed no too accurate in effects]

- - Sensors (as you mentioned)
	- Bio
	- Metallurgy/Minerology
	- Energy
	etc.

- - Mapmaker (uses ultrasonic waves or somesuch to give a rough topographic 
map of the surrounding area; maps may be edited by the user; the unit 
will update the map as additional data becomes available, for instance 
when it is moved closer to an object that could not be mapped properly 
from a distance).  This would possibly be a chip/sensor combination.

- - Expert Systems Chips (provide a person with a skill level of one or 
greater in a given subject (and computer use skill of 1 or greater) with 
access to level 6 knowledge for knowledge-based tasks?)  

- - Language/Translation programs - perhaps specific ones for each known 
language, and an expert-systems style one that would try to extrapolate 
meaning of an unknown language based on known languages (if such is 
possible, given the diversity of life in the Traveller universe).

- ----

I can see such add-ons being a great source of material for a Ship\'s 
Locker-style article for JTAS.

What do you think?

I think similar efforts (vis-a-vis a migration to a cashless society) are 
under way in some european countries as well.  

My Imperium used an ID card-based system for transactions.  Cash still 
existed (in the form of coin, not paper money, thus making it much less 
convenient and encouraging use of the ID card and therefore 
traceability), and the PC\'s tended to use cash because of their many 
shady dealings (grin).  But use of cash was "frowned upon" in polite society.

Anyone else use this sort of system in Traveller?

Thanks for posting that.  I learn something new every day. :)

Man, with all the technology already available, it\'s amazing to think 
what could be done already...let alone in the Far Future.  Sure, if new 
technology was deployed at the maximum rate possible, people would be 
even more overwhelmed and confused than we alredy are.  But it gives 
interesting food for thought.

Yes, indeed, the idea that there is a strong pocket empire there is a 
likely one.  Unless there was a purely technolgy-related reason for the 
lack of expansion in that direction, of course.  Hmmm.  This could make 
for an interesting first T4 board game. :)

I wonder about the two high-pop, type E starport worlds, too.

Yes, that would be an additional factor in expansion.  I hadn\'t thought 
of that aspect.  Another restriction on the rate of expansion would be 
the resources necessary to bring a world into the Imperium.

  Shadowrun has a neat system. "book" prices rarely apply in the game,
they have a street value index that represents the items value "on the
street". For example, military (or just plain rare) stuff is much more
expensive than it\'s list price, while things like food and shelter are an
index of "1" (same value).

  In Traveller terms, an FGMP-15 would have a street index of 3 or 4
(possibly higher on low tech/high law worlds) representing the result of
Imperial controls on very powerful military weaponry. A PC could pay
Cr400,000 for one in char-gen or they could pay MCr1.2 (or more) to get
one "on the street" after leaving service.

  The guy I play under for SR also modifies these based on the "contact"
you use to get the stuff. In Traveller terms, this means if you have a
(TNE) contact that\'s military, for example a supplies officer, you could
get one for only a small additional fee to grease the works.

   Only on a Planetary basis. Interplanetary commerce used offical bank
drafts (Imperial Credits being, for the most part, and abstraction and
legal fiction implemented to facilitate interplanetary commerce and
Imperial taxation) that are VERY VERY VERY difficult to forge, practically
impossible, relying on a combination of physical manifestation (thin
polymer drafts) with a data representation (single-purpose computer and
read-only datastore similar to CD embedded in the draft).

   Drafts are converted to local currency at the starport, and are usually
deposited at a local bank where the PCs can withdraw cash if they need it.
Imperial law states it is illegal to charge for such a transaction, and
fair value is given. (the Imperium subsidizes the transaction)

Yeah, Joe.  Sounds a lot like modern day Canada.  We replaced our
one-dollar bill with a coin back around 1987 and just replaced our
two-dollar bill earlier this year.  The government\'s excuse was that coins
can last over twenty years before needing to be replaced while the average
life expectancy for paper money is much, much less.

Coins aren\'t currently worth the effort in counterfeiting.  They also make
it easier to pay for parking or buying cigarettes from coin-operated
machines (I think a pack of cigarettes goes for about five bucks Canadian
when bought from a machine, but I could be wrong).  But with inflation
going the way its going, my own father thinks that the measly "penny" may
eventually dissappear ("they\'d just round out everything to the nearest
dime", he said).  By the time we have a five-dollar coin, chocolate bars
will cost about $2.00 anyway  8-)

OTOH, the coins tend to add up pretty quickly.  I saw ID4 opening day
(night) and payed for my admission and a mox of yummy Junior Mints with
"pocket change".  I tend to use Interact (ie: direct withdrawl or debit
cards) quite frequently.

Hmmm.  \'twould be an interesting house rule to introduce.  Many referees 
already adjust the prices, but it would be nice to bring some 
standardization and quantification to it.  

Then again, most of the time I "wing it" during actual sessions. I have 
memorized the rules I find important, have handy any important tables, 
and the rest of the rules generally get ignored.  :)  Still, I always 
figure more rules available means more choice for the referee....

You really thought it out!  Sounds like a workable system.  Funny how 
such minutia can grow in importance, eh?  I guess that\'s because such 
small things add believability to the setting.

The sticking point of my ID-card/cashless concept was the lack of 
subspace/faster-than-jump communications.  On a planetary basis, the idea 
works well.  But in the Imperium, a lot of handwaving must be done.  I 
still used it, though, because I invented it before I realized that 
Traveller limited communications to the speed of Jump.  It was an 
artifact of the campaign, so I had to keep it.  Besides, I liked it! :)

This is an aspect of Traveller I never explored, but which I wish I had: 
local currencies and exchange rates.  I just made the Imperial Credit 
the monetary standard for all member worlds.  Lots of missed 
opportunities there.

If I recall correctly, the US Government talked of doing something 
similar recently, but there was a negative reaction from the populace.  I 
remember there being several commentaries about the convenience of paper 
over coin.  Personally, I like coins better.  I\'d rather not have to use 
something the size of the U.S. silver dollar, but if they made something 
about the size and weight of the U.S. dime, I\'d be happy to use it.

[further discussion of benefits of using coins vs. cash snipped for brevity]
> "pocket change".  I tend to use Interact (ie: direct withdrawl or debit

While I like the idea of debit cards, I guess I\'m just too paranoid to 
use them.  I don\'t like the fact that purchase information is collected 
from credit and debit card usage.  

Just recently, I started dividing my purchases into two types:  Major and 
minor.  Major purchases are all done on the credit card (ie, furniture, 
major appliances, electronics, etc.) and paid off the next month.  Minor 
purchases are all done with cash (groceries, drug store items, etc.).  
No checks are used, except for mail order purchases that cannot be done 
on credit (and of course, checks are used to pay the monthly bills!).   

After years of experimenting, I find I like using cash best.  The 
anonymity is great, for one.  But for major purchases, credit works best 
so long as your issuer gives you one month interest free on your 
purchases...because that delays the time you have to pay for the 
purchase, during which you can earn interest on the money you\'ve already 
spent! :)  

But enough of real-world finances....sorry to have digressed. (Hey, 
there\'s not been much activity on the mailing lists, and talking about 
this is better than starting a flame war, I think! :)

Okay, to do the requisite tie-in with Traveller:  I was surprised when I 
came upon references within Traveller material to paper money.  It seemed 
so anacronistic to me.  But, perhaps there was a good reason behind it.  
Anyone have any ideas?

I\'ll stick to coin and ID cards in my campaigns, though.

Coins exists and are still widely used (the Imperial Credit has an image

I thought I read somewhere that Traveller used "hard currency" designed
around the old Play-Doh press you used to see on TV.  The theory was that
you take a number of different coloured polymer fibres (about 0.5mm in
diameter) and form them into a block (maybe 2" by 5"), whose overall length
is dictated by the length of the individual fibres (maybe twenty feet or
so).  Bond the fibres together using heat and shove the whole mess into a
baloney slicer that turns the block into a bunch of thin sheets.  The
pattern of the fibres would be identical from sheet to sheet and the
different colours of the fibres would form the pattern on the sheet.  This
would require counterfeiters to use more expensive and extravagant
equipment than your average, legal, everyday $25,000 colour photocopier.

Of course, I could have read this somewhere else, but it was quite a
lengthy description so it had to belong in a system that used hard currency
during everyday life.

have a few comments to make.

One I think Joe Walsh talked about thin polymer computers you could roll 
up.  That\'s nat all that far fetched...there was an article in Scientific 
American a few months back, regarding organic conductors. On of the (far 
fetched at this point) applications mentioned was exactly that, or rather 
a display that could be rolled up.

Second,I read in possibly another source, possibly Sci Am, again, that 
some researchers had developed paper white, high resolution LCD\'s... low 
power devices that could replicate quite well the printed page. The 
advantage was that the backing was actually a reflective surface, hence 
the paper white part, producing a display that could be read just about 
anywhere a printed page could be.  I\'ve wanted one of these for a loong 
time...nothing complex, just a display, a lot of memory, and some way of 
dumping text to the thing, sort of an electronic book.  Even with today\'s 
technology it could be set up to run on a couple of C-Cells, and be 
reasonably cheap, I think. It\'s just that everyone\'s marketing manager 
wants to pile in handwriting recognition, spreadsheet calculations, 
internet connections, transponder circuits..;-) 

	My personal belief is that a \'hand computer\' will be actually a 
number of different devices each with different niches...more appliances 
than general purpose computers. You\'ll have your HP 635445323z 
engineer\'s pocket tool, with lot\'s of graphics and calculating 
horsepower, with probably handwriting recognition input.  The StenoTab, a 
text manipulator, probably dual voice and handwriting input. The Atari 
80000 XXl, hacker\'s tool extraodinary (That\'s for you Joe ;-)

	I seriously doubt, in fact that general purpose computers will be
widespread (and if they do, they\'ll never need more that 640 k of memory
;-), but most of the functionality of what we use computers for will be
subsumed into more specialized devices: communicators ( a sort of
cell-phone-fax-video-e-mail-network browser device), calculators,
writing/graphic design tools (much like a notepad, the paper kind, today, 
but with a lot more built in smarts), etc. 

	This comes from supporting a lot on novice users through a lot of 
stuff, like the people who start Word Perfect to find, copy and duplicate 
files on their systems, then wonder, when we told them to navigate to a 
file, and double click on it, it doesn\'t start the program. To these 
people, this isn\'t a Intel P5/75 general purpose, programmable device, 
it\'s a Word Perfect machine, which sometimes doubles as an e-mail 
machine.  I\'ve had people ask me if they could get their e-mail with WP 
instead of this other program.  

	As more sophisticated computer users, we laugh at them, but what
is truly wrong with their approach? Once useful computing power on the
order of the size and weight and price of a 8 1/2 x 11 notepad, why not have 
your word perfect machine up on the shelf next to your mailing list?

	Now, of course, that has some pretty severe implications for the 
game...what then, is Computer skill good for?

It could very well be that such a system was written up for Traveller.  
There was so /much/ written for it!  :)   The paper money reference I 
mentioned was from something I read (or re-read) recently.  I\'ve been 
reading TNE, JTAS, and Signal GK, among other things.  Could have come 
from anywhere.  I should take notes when I read this stuff. :)

Anyway...

whistles).

So, it\'ll be something like the current calculator market, eh?  Makes 
sense if that simplifies the interface.  And, that\'s what Tom Ellis has 
been saying is the case in his campaign.

Then again, maybe the interface will be so simple and logical someday 
that the users won\'t even worry which application they are using...maybe 
they won\'t even have to know what an application /is/!  They\'d just say, 
"Get my mail," and let the computer worry about how to do it.

;)  True.  If computer skill is simply skill in using applications, then 
there may not be much call for it (except in those darned legacy Cobol 
systems that will still be around in the year 1114 of the Third Imperium, 
only they\'ll think its 1014 because they only use two characters to store 
the date[G]).  But, if Computer skill is used in programming, it\'d still 
be useful until computers are smart enough to program themselves.  I\'m 
still waiting for the programming platform that will allow me to describe 
what I want in vague terms which it will then use to program the 
application for me. :)  (By vague terms, I mean, "Make a fun game.":P)

Tom,

hehehehe.  Now THAT would be a nice situation for some "civilized" 
adventurers to find themselves in.   "No, see, these things are 
redeemable for goods and services throughout the Imperium!  They\'re much 
more valuable than that water you\'ve got there."  Probably not the best 
of times to have to explain monetary theory. "Uh...plus, they have this 
nifty picture of Emperor Strephon!"

Speaking of things economic, I\'ve always used the rule of thumb of 
real-world prices wherever I could.  In essence, I tied the value of the 
Imperial credit to the American dollar.  It worked for us, anyway.  
(As a baseline.  Prices varied with location, economic conditions, the 
weather, and the mood of the seller, as usual, of course.:)

Incidentally, I used the old "guns or butter" example literally as a part 
of the setting of one adventure.  One country produced a lot of butter 
but few guns, and another found it better to produce lots of guns and 
little butter.  It worked fine unti a third country began buying up all 
the guns, which left the butter country feeling vulnerable.  Enter the 
intrepid Adventurers to solve one of my patented schooling-based 
adventures (no, this wasn\'t the most boring one - that would be the 
infamous Ecology series I did in Champions:).

Such as...?  Just wondering.

The number of forms of money seem to increase over time, though, so I 
don\'t doubt something very much like that could come along.  Especially 
given the nature of communications in the Imperium. 

I imagine any world on which one does not have a bank accunt would 
require the use of cash or cash equivalents such as cashier\'s checks or 
money orders (or the future equivalent thereof).  Otherwise, one could 
spend the same money twice - once on each of two different worlds - and 
skip out before word of the deceit got around.

Probably not.  You could *try* but it would be tough.  It is a matter of
getting the equiptment used to, which is strictly controlled.

Nobles stockpiling "real" money. Gray market transactions, not illegal per
se.  Still harder to track than credit transactions, as in notes of
credit or other bank notes or debit mechanisms.

Yes.  Very true, hence the need for "foolproof" (only fools trust that
word) money.

I just don\'t keep up with the Sci-Fi world like I used to.  Like my 
tagline says, I kind of stopped getting new stuff for my hobbies after 
the \'80s.  It\'s all new to me...

Is myomer now a well-known term throughout sci-fi fandom, or is it only 
used in MechWarrior stuff?  If the former, it\'d be OK for use with 
Traveller, but if the latter...

Check Traveller Chronicle #6.  It has articles on the Gralyn Union, located
in Reavers\' Deep.  The planet I mentioned was an out of the way, little
mining world called Kamloops.  It was detailed by TNE-Pocket member
Mitch "Ted7" Schwartz.

  Absolutely. (I have some _very_ intelligent types in my group, and they
always ask questions like "How come nobody forges Imperial money? It can\'t
be THAT hard." Said character usually a "street" type with forgery. ;->)

  I tend to think about such stuff anyways. Games like monopoly and stock
ticker have always fascinated me. <g>

   Well, not *that* much handwaving needs to be done, your players ship\'
is, after all, no faster (and frequently slower) than the propogation lag
of the communications medium. You could just assume that *all* ships
operate (to some degree) as x-boats and carry computer data between
systems as a courtesy, and some of that data is Bank Transactions. ;-)

   The sticking point, in my mind, is the security of such a network.
That\'s why I went with the "bank draft" method. 

   You could just as easily say that the bank drafts ARE the currency, and
that\'s what Imperial currency _is_. Un-forgable because each bank-note is
an ultra-cheap polymer computer that "knows" how much it\'s worth. The
notes are encoded with a one-way key, known only by the Imperial bank but
all banks in the Imperium, indeed any consumer/merchant, have access to
the public half of the key to validate the note. In addition, the physical
manifestation of the note, the polymer "body" of the computer/note, adds
another layer of forgery protection, much like the paper is a secret
weapon of modern treasury departments. It could have all sorts of neat
seals and holo-art to identify the note.

   There was a real neat chart in one of the earlier JTAS books that
mentioned exchange rates (this is actually what got me started thinking
about this). You should try and find it. If you can\'t find it/don\'t have
it, let me know and I\'ll post the bare-bones chart. It makes all sorts of
things makes sense.

   For example, how come a TL15 weapon is no more expensive than the same
weapon manufactured using TL10 tech? Simple answer: it IS! <g> Use the
exchange charts between a TL10 world and a TL15 world, and you get a real
nice inflation. Naturally, TL10 worlds WOULD pay more local currency to
acquire advanced tech. The weapon could very well be cheaper to make (in
TL15 credits) but inflation between TL\'s will insure that the lower tech
world will be paying what the item is REALLY worth. (I hope I am being
clear enough here)

  EMP is a direct result of nuclear activity, like the radiation. In fact
it IS radiation. ;-)  Not sure how effective shielding is, some of this
stuff is pretty heavily classified by the DoD.

  EMP will propogate like any other EM, using the inverse square law.

   They exist, but there are problems. Future prostheses will use these
extensively, for obvious reasons.

Changes to the table using these corrections:

Scratch the TL8 missile: it doesn\'t exist.

The TL14 SIM missile has a rating of 7/7 (instead of 8/8)

1)  SmartCards.  Down in Australia, MasterCard has rolled out a thing
called SmartCard(tm).  It is something like a debit card, but it is
supposed to have an on-board CPU to let you make debit purchases without
having to query the bank.

2)  Street index.  In Shadowrun, they modify price via the street index
some things are cheaper on the street, some more expensive.  Additionally,
they have an availability rating.  It is the target number a player has to
roll to be able to purchase the item (along with a time frame (e.g.)
Availability 4, 3 Days).  One of the best parts is that in character
generation, a player cannot acquire an item of higher than a 6
availability.

3)  I was working on some ship designs (fighter craft of course), and I
noticed that the listed values in the SSDS for electronics do not match
what I compute for a smaller package.  I also noticed that the PEMS arrays
need a certain hull length (BEFORE configuration modifications) meaning
that the std civilian package would not work on any ship less than 300
tons (Antenna Diameter is 20).  Are we going to drop this?  Lastly the
power requirements seem to be all out of whack, along with size and
weight.

Am I missing some errata about size weight and prices.  
I did not include 
1 x 30 Mm EMS Jammer          4.4             2.2            .44          
   22                  8.8
as it drew too much power.

I did design an external pod for use on a space craft.  It comes in two
varieties (Fuel Cell and Batteries).

Area Jammer Pod (1hour duration)
45 Mm Radius (Standard Area Jammer)
                       Vol        Wt            Price
Fuel Cell       41.85     46.035       16.74
Batteries       21.6       38.61        16.2675

15 Mm Radius (1 hex only)
                       Vol        Wt            Price
Fuel Cell       13.95     15.345       5.88
Batteries       7.2         12.87         5.4225  (Incidentally this would
fit on a std missile launch rail)

3 Mm Radius (less than 1 hex)
                       Vol        Wt            Price
Fuel Cell       2.79        3.069        1.116
Batteries       1.44       2.574         .0845

The weight is + 10% of components for the Shell.  I figure the batteries
could be recharged from excess power from the small craft until needed,
then it could be dropped from the craft with the momentum of the craft,
which could then hide behind it using it as a shield.  If a formation was
using them, they could switch on/off on various turns.

Do we have any designs for larger than standard missiles?

Lastly what is the duration of a standard missile, and could a fighter
mount them with "docking rings" for a .5 ton craft?  This would enable the
mounting of other types of ordnance (larger missiles) by mounting less
total ordnance but the same Td.

Also small craft might mount even smaller weapons then the standard ship
lasers if they are meant to fight either smaller craft, or
interface/ground troops.  IIRC, the Victrix or was it Fury mounted a
Plasma Cannon.  And does 40 armour seem a little high.  Maybe for
performance reasons we could use only 10-20.  After all if a 20 ton
fighter gets hit by a Ship Laser it is most likely toast, so it needs to
make sure it isn\'t hit.

In australia we HAVE traveller currency! All of our notes are made from a 
polymer which is clear then prointed on. This means security features 
like see-through windows makes it hard for forgers.

I have seen Greg Porter\'s vision on the cashless society (via his draft 
equipment chapter for T4). He has thoughtthis through, and his solutions 
are elegent. Transaction will now require (At TL12) data packets, with a 
huge network streamlining financial transactions.

Why should you bother. All transactions would be computer based, so that 
you will buy in YOUR currency, a bank will do the conversions and give 
the retailer THEIR Currency. It is a seamless system.

So what is it exactly about an electronic device that would make it
suseptible?  If it was related to silicon, even fibreoptic computers would
contain silicon in the transistors that make up the CPU and memory
circuits.  What\'s to prevent damage to things like dedicated jump drive
circuits, CG, sensors, and workstations?  I would think there is a lot more
aboard a space craft other than just the computer that would be suceptible
to an EMP.

	I\'m not one of the list\'s resident physics people, I\'m just an
economist, but since no one answered you the first time around I\'ll take a
crack at it. 

1)  Conductors
2)  Conductors (like your computer)
3)  Probably
4)  An EMP is short for Electro-Magnetic Pulse.  Light is 
electro-magnetic and it propagates just fine through a vacuum.
5)  An EMP is the product of charged particles moving very rapidly 
through a magnetic field.  One way to get this is to explode a nuke in 
the Earth\'s upper atmosphere.
6)  Just cuz.

Now anyone got any economics questions? :-)

Literally, "a period between reigns". It\'s more often used to describe
the time between the fall of a goverment and the rise of a new one.

You\'ve discovered the terrible secret. 

All of it, the assassination, the cival war, even the virus...

It was all due to Strephon throwing out a chain letter that\'d started

It\'s probably still occuring.

Actually, it depends on the circumstances. Mainly on whether or not the
area has a subsistence level economy, and how far above subsistence it
is, if it\'s above it.

By definition, a subsistence level economy is one where you *cannot*
spare any labor from the task of producing food and shelter. There
won\'t be any cobblers or tailors. You\'ll go barefoot if the climate
allows, or you\'ll wear homemade shoes.

The SKS action is scaled down from a WWII era anti-tank rifle, and I

I think he\'s saying that the bullet is 15mm, but contains a 5.5mm
flechette. Remembere, he says "DS" that\'s "discarding sabot", so it\'s
essentially a 15 mm APFSDS round.

Last time I looked, the DOS PDF reader was too big to run on an XT or
low end 286 system like this one. I have *no* XMS (and no way to add
it). I can add EMS if I ever track down a board that\'ll fit. And I have
an "enhanced CGA" video.

I\'m taking this partly from things like the way "battleship admirals"
felt about carriers, and the way the rest of the Air Force feels about
the ground atytack support squadrons (ie the guys who provide air
support to ground units). In case you didn\'t know, most of the AF would
just as soon get rid of these guys or at leasat stick them in planes
that can shoot down other planes, or do bombing runs. The Gulf War got
the Warthog drivers a repreive. The AF *was* going to phase it out for
something "sexier" (but not nearly as good in a ground support role).
The Warthog drivers don\'t think much of the rest of the AF.

Well, sort of. A quick MetaCrawler search on Myomer came up with the 
following (along with lots of BattleTech stuff, but I ignored that. Actually, I 
also got a hit on a \'female problem\', but I assume that wasn\'t 
relevant either. ;-)

A search on Nitinol turned up 47 hits. Most about robotics and shape 
memory. So, I think I can say, that, yes, myomer exists. Sort of. ;-)

And if you want to buy some, I\'m sure the guys below will only be too

As the major powers exsusted their crew reserves to fight in the
Rebellion. The navies had to rely on more autonimous ship systems. This
resulted in computers gaining a rudimentary self awareness. When the
war was fought for logical objectives and means, the semi-selfaware
ships were "happy" to blast other semi-selfaware ships.

The "Black War" changed that! The War had degenerated to outright
revenge and cruelty. Many computers suffered a nervous breakdown.
Some commited suicied. Some decided to wipeout the true virus: mankind.
Still others decided to control the technology that mankind could have.

        EMP, or electromagnetic pulse, is a pulse of radiation caused
        by nuclear explosion. While a nuclear explosion causes radiation
        in wide spectrum, the term "EMP" generally refers only to the
        electromagnetic radiation in radio frequencies.

        The effect of strong radio-frequency pulse is to induce current
        in conductive wires, that is, conductive wires act as antennas.
        The resulting current pulse may damage any sensitive electronic
        devices, and computers appear to be highly vulnerable. Note that
        even weak radio-frequency pulses can be dangerous in certain
        situations. Modern passenger airplanes have many kilometers of
        wiring around the passenger compartment, and a GSM telephone can
        induce false signals in flight control data bus if the phone is
        used within the plane.

        Some electronic components can be protected against RF noise
        using RF shielding, but it is very difficult to defend against
        nuclear EMP. The only real defense against EMP is using non-
	sensitive components. These can be either "hardened" electronic
	devices or optical devices. Hardened electronics are specifically
	designed to withstand EMPs, but only fairly simple devices (such
	as radios) can be hardened, and hardened devices are generally
	larger and heavier than corresponding normal devices.

	Since optical circuits contain only small amounts of conductive
	materials, they should be fairly immune to EMPs. Theoretically
	modern ORM processor (Optic RISC Machine) should be immune to the
	effects of a EMP.

We must be talking about two different SKS\'s then the one I\'m refering to 
is a first generation automatic rifle, 10 round magazine, integral 
bayonet designed in the late 40\'s early 50\'s.  Sold very heavilly to 3rd

to the AKM.

According to Brilliant Lances a Nuclear Detonation in space is not 
sufficient enought to do any harm to a computer, a PAW on the other hand 
does double the crew hits due to radiation and all computers, except 
fiber optic, automatically suffer as System Reset result.  Which I can\'t 
find for some reason but I\'d imagine it means you lose all sensor locks 
etc.  Can someone clarify please.

In an atmosphere the effects are far more devestating.  Within the 
primary burst radius all space ships have 5 major electronic hits rolled 
and all spaceships in the secondary burst radius have 1 major electronic 
hit rolled.

The sky is blue because the elves ran out of purple paint and there was a 
 special on blue that day.  8)

I always though this was silly - it couldn\'t happen. In this case
(something that can\'t be taken over), the Virus will either leave an "egg"
(a dormant Trojan Horse program) or just bomb the place. A TL-6 D-class
\'port doesn\'t take much destroying. 

2. Potted review of TTC #10

Well, I did wonder why Harold had been quiet for so long... 

I want to congratulate Harold on a sterling job on the Solomani Rim. In
*The Traveller Chronicle #10*, Harold has taken a reasonably dull area
(for me) and made it both alive and interesting. Richard Biever has
created yet another great cover, and the surrounding marbling effect is
striking. My only quibble is that the dual system stats are reversed from
other publications; 1201 first and 1117 second (I kept looking at the
stats and wondering why the map was wrong - duh!). The explanation of the
Known Star List for the Rim was detailed and interesting, especially the
quirks such as the placement of Alderbaran and the replacement of Alpha
Crucis by Alpha Leonis (Regulus). 

I hope that IG uses these sort of detailed player contributions in their
various product releases. We have seen that they heed the voices of their
players by their attitude to the work on starships. They would do well to
retain this attitude when writing their pseudo-historical backgrounds (I
only sound this pompous because I can\'t spell "Milieu" <sp?>). 

[Aside - I\'m using Leroy\'s dot map as a Windows .bmp at work - when will
the Marches be included?]

Finally, the adventure is intruiging and makes a change from the typical
"all guns blazing" smash\'n\'grag scenario (although I detect too much
influence from *The Magician\'s Nephew*, perhaps?!)

Overall, I highly recommend TTC #10 as a worthwhile addition to your
Traveller library. 

3. Beyond

For Joe\'s sake, the Beyond and Vanguard Reaches were declared "non-canon"
by their authors (not GDW, AFAIK), and then Chuck Kallenbach re-released
both sectors. For full details, try:

4. Quoting

William said:  
>I need quoting to call up what people are talking about.... 

My earlier plea was not to scrap quoting, just to quote the relevent bits
rather than entire paragraphs. I don\'t have usenet access (at least, I
don\'t *think* I do ?!), so don\'t know how bad it is over there. Over here,
I like reading people\'s opinions (and I quote myself here ;-): 

>The above is not intended as a way of saying people\'s POV\'s are
unimportant. 

I just didn\'t want to hear them three times in a row, that\'s all. ;-) The
reduction in cross-posting has been a BIG help here, and I want to thank
you all for your restraint. 

There you go, a bouquet in the midst of all the flames! 

5. Imperial Marines

When I and my group read about "The Big Stick" (Imp Marine Grav APC) and
the accompanying attitude ("just level the damn block"), we all said, "Oh!
we see, they\'re *Americans*!"  - did we miss something? 

6. AD&D Die Rolls

James asked: 
>...4d6 (ignore the lowest die result) Now... which one of these methods
>will mathmatically produce the better (ie: higher) result?  The gauntlet
>has been dropped 8-)

Definitely 4d6 rolled *seven* times (eight if you used Comeliness), and
drop the lowest die from each stat roll, and the worst stat roll. This
skews the stats to above average characters. 

...and before anyone says this is too much of an advantage, my opinion is
that: 
1) this doesn\'t confer that much of an advantage; 
2) the DM can always make it tough for the PC\'s, even 17th-level ones; 
3) this is a cheap way of letting the players *believe* they are getting
an advantage. Not that it helps any, mind... 

7. PC Ornamentation

I have Snoopy asleep on his doghouse, a wooden silhouette cat trying to
reach down and claw my mouse, and a small stuffed dog (used to clean the
dust off my screen - my wife gasps when I do that, though ;-). BTW,
Leonard, I\'m afraid we *do* get the pink-bunny-Energiser ads "down here".

How does it work?
CBTM is a long sheet of computer material made of multiple 
layers; here is a simple cut-away picture of the actual working 
computer!

Protective Layer        Transparent Skin
                        ----

                        ----

*Note: Picture has been simplified for marketing purposes;  power
connections and signal busses not shown.  They make up several 
layers of their own.

An explanation of the layers is in order:
The Photomer layer is the video interface to the computer, it
can display FULL-COLOR images (infrared and ultraviolet layers 
extra) on its whole surface.  Photomers are special polymer 
fibers that change colors when an electric current is applied.  
They also work the other way - shine a light on it, and electric 
current will result. (author note: I don\'t know wether this is 
true or not)  
So you can use light pens as an interface.  You can also buy the
ultra-sensitive Photomer layer that can actually act the eyes of
the computer!  (note: bright lights will damage the ultra-sense
photomer layer - for everyday uses, simply add a stick-it-in 
video camera peripheral!)

Computer layer:  This layer is actually millions of tiny 
microprocessors with a limited instruction set - For example, it 
can perform all the mathematical functions, and also redirect 
power to the other layers for video display or power management. 
A single neuron cannot do much, but together they are almost as 
powerful as the human brain!  The key to harnessing this power is
the Stick-It-In Controller Capsule, a 10-credit-sized round 
processing unit.  Simply plunge the needles on the processor deep
enough into the CBTM sheet and it will take control of the whole 
computer!  It will assess the computing power at its disposal, 
and actually teach the computer how to use its neurons for the 
uses YOU require. Other software caps are just as easy to use, as
well as all the Stick-it-in peripherals.  This is the MOST 
USER-FRIENDLY computer you will ever use!  Handwriting and voice 
recognition are just a few thumb-pushes away!


Power layer:  This layer is a very powerful battery that is 
entirely flexible and like every other layer, it can actually be 
cut in half and keep on giving power.  This shiny metallic layer 
is worth a lot of Recycling Points, bring it back to a service 
center and you will get a credit on your next purchase of 
Computer-By-The-Foot! (The ACEP battery is being devellopped by 
a Canadian, at one of the Hydro-Quebec research center.  Damn 
we\'re smart. :)  It makes you wonder why the aliens would land 
in the US instead of here. :) What about recharging, you say?  
Read on further! 

Myomer layer:  Myomers, (from the latin "myo" meaning muscle - I 
believe muscle fibers are known as myosin) are much like 
photomers, put in an electric current and the fiber will change 
shape!  What happens is that electrons will attach themselves to 
certain sites in the fibers making their molecular shape change.
The opposite is also true!  So you can exert some force on the 
fibers and they will create a current!  What does this mean for 
you, the buyer?  Well, first of all, you don\'t need to recharge 
the computer!  Just move it around a lot and it will recharge 
itself!   Strap it on your pets or purchase one of those archaic 
TL6 clothing washing-tumbling machines!  The CBTM is actually 
completely washable, with our special non-abrasive detergent! 

* Purchase now and you will ALSO receive a 200 gr box of CBTM *
* Detergent, absolutely free!  A bonus of 20 credits!         *

The myomer layer is actually sensitive enough to respond to 
human touch - it can be used as a touch-interface to detect 
finger-sized objects. (Get the texture-sensitive layer, half 
price with the extra-sense photomer layer!).

The other use of the myomer layer is of course, as the muscles 
of the computer!  By itself, the computer can learn to crawl on 
the floor like a snail and do simple things like push and pull 
objects.  (Equivalent to a very light tentacle - about 2 kg of 
strenght max for a 8.5*11 sheet - beyond that the power supply 
isn\'t enough and the sheet might rip apart).  For more complex 
actions, the CBTM Mech-Anno skeletton kit can be bought, 
allowing the computer to actually walk around and lift things 
like a true robot!  The computer can be attached to any
object you require with our special CMBT Shear-Less Sure-Grip

   Use a folding array if the AD is greater than L.

  I do. ;-) I have a couple for both EAPlaC and HEPlaR.

  For EAPlaC the benefits aren\'t spectacular, but HEPlaR is really nice.
The general ruling on the beta list is you build a HEPlaR missile the same
way you design a ship. (eg, shell, avionics, computer, etc) except it\'s
unmanned.

> Lastly what is the duration of a standard missile,
   
  The duration, in g-turns, is listed on the standard missile list. (I
can\'t remember if TNE has such a list, but FF&S and BL both have one)

   IE, a TL12 errata-modified SIM standard missile with a 500kt warhead
has a performance of 9g9 - that\'s a 9g performance with 9 g-turns of fuel.
(IOW, one turn at full thrust)

   HEPlaR missiles are great fun, getting performance numbers like 11g67.

  Use hardpoints. There\'s a list of mounts on page 152 of FF&S, but you
can just wing it. I would use grapples for larger than standard missiles
and simple fixed mounts (no mass, vol, or cost) for standard missiles.

  Dunno about that. Fighters are hard to hit. (VS, agile, etc) but TL12
MFD\'s ignore 4 difficulty levels and high ROF\'s get you another 5
difficulty levels. That\'s a total of 9. Ouch!

  I\'d just armor it to the point where it\'s diminishing returns (mass and
cost vs. protection) and not worry about it. Fit the fighter with an
escape pod (the flight deck, essentially) and build as many of the cheap
suckers as you can.

  I use fighters as mobile 300 MW hole-punchers. ;-)

  The "handwaving" about fiber-optic computers is that they exculsively
use optic switching, instead of electronic switching. This makes them
immune to all sorts of stuff electronics are vulnerable to.

Okay James I\'ve done some preliminary work.  On this, hell I\'m pretty 
much finished it.  At TL8, Using DS you\'ve got a damage of 13 a 
penetration of 1-1-2 and a range of 255 (ironsite).  This means that at 
800 meters you\'d be able to penetrate an AV of 6 which translates to 3cm 
of hard steel, or 2 cm of Titanium alloy, or 1.5cm of light composite or 
1 cm of composite laminate.

The problem is the weapon weigh\'s in at, 87.74 kg loaded, with no bipod 
or recoil supression gear.  Though it only has a recoil of 5.  My problem 
is because I don\'t have exact dimensions on the cartrage case I\'m having 
to interpolate the size of the ammunition through the gauss rifle tables, 
we know the muzzle velosity and weight of the round, creating an actual 
muzzle energy and then using this to come up with everything else.  Now 
unfortunately much of the inital design relies on average muzzle energy 
not actual.

Statistically speaking it\'s pretty much a mirror of the "Crunch Gun" 
except the "Crunch Gun" is considerably more portable and has a better 
range by 15 meters.

I\'ll post the whole thing including the design sequence when I\'m 
finished.  It\'ll be a long post so keep your eyes open.

   Good books! I\'ve always liked Drake, but I especially liked COE.

   On the same subject, the Exordium series (Sherwood Smith and Dave
Trowbridge) has a nifty item called the Boswell (well read types should

get into your head via neural induction. Essentailly the perfect

  In Traveller terms, this would be a plasma weapon. IIRC, the glass was
fired at such high velocities it turned into plasma.

All quite true, though electronic computers are more sensitive to EMP 
than electric motors and other "high-power-density" devices are.  The way 
an EMP causes damage is by inducing voltage across components; in effect, 
it rolls along through space, touching the leads of a powerful virtual 
battery to various parts of the objects it encounters.  A device built to 
carry a kiloamp at 50,000 volts will barely notice; a chip designed for a 
milliamp at 5 V will *definitely* notice.

Those of you who have dug around inside your computers will be aware that 
circuit boards and individual chips must be handled with some caution; 
they\'re shipped in anti-static bags, and computer technicians (and smart 
home users) go to some trouble to discharge static from their hands 
before working with them.  That\'s because even the very low power of a 
static discharge (relatively high voltage, but tiny current) can damage 
chips.  EMP eats \'em for breakfast.

You\'re entirely correct in your suggestion that even a "fiber optic" 
computer (and the ship around it) will contain electronic components.  
The key here is that the induced voltage across a component is (partly) 
related to the size of that component.  Long conducting wire runs suck up 
EMP, and transfer the voltage to the chips they\'re attached to; tiny 
chips and other electronic devices linked by non-conducting fiber optics 
are much less vulnerable.

To demonstrate the power of EMP, a few years back (as I recall, details 
are hazy in my mind), there was a severe solar storm, pumping lots of 
charge particles into the Earth\'s magnetosphere.  These were channeled 
down into the atmosphere over the magnetic poles, causing spectacular 
aurorae.  The Canadian power system had a 400-km stretch of high tension 
wires running from (relatively) near the north magnetic pole directly 
away from it.  The atmospheric EMP caused by the stream of high-energy 
charged particles zapping into the inonosphere "grounded out" through 
this conveniently-placed, *very* long conductive medium -- and blew up a 
power substation at the far end.

Kinda makes you think, don\'t it? :)

>What exactly do EMPs affect?

EMP produces a potential voltage that travels wave-like, that is, it\'s
directional. I cannot remember exact numbers (is there a nuclear weapon
physicist doctor in the house?) but lets suppose, for example, that the
potential is 1000 Volts per centimeter. (I think this is low.)

That means, a conductor (a piece of wire) 10 inches long has a
potential across it of 25,000 volts DC. So a device normally seeing 5
or 12 volts (our PCs) across power terminals 2 inches apart would be
subjected to 5000 volts across those terminals.

Fortunately, the pulse has a finite duration, so the potential for
destruction is only so great.

Notice that unlike electicity of popular coneption, EMPs are
directional. They will travel along a wire in a certain direction.
Sharp right angles can *throw off* an EMP, depending on the conductor.
However, the EMP path does not need the classic conductor. At very high
voltage potentials, most materials will conduct, even insulators.

Using a susceptibility analysis, EMP-resistant electronics can be
designed by providing channels for the EMP to move through. The
combination of geometry and insulation an provide reasonable protection
against EMP effects. Stuff like shielded opto-isolators which have
sharp right angles can provide protection from antenna-collected
EMP-energy on the outside of a spacecraft to the electronics inside.
(Current technology). Some protection can be gained by making circuits
resistant to large transients, really large. I suspect that highly
improved insulators are also present at high tech level as well.

What\'s effected? Anything electronic (current technology), that is,
anything relying on electricity for operation. Without shielding and
good designs, any system on a spacecraft that meets this requirement is
susceptible. Things designed to collect energy are more susceptible
(sensors). Long conducting channels (meson tunnels) would also be
susceptible.

My canon is that *any* fighting vessel designed to be used in or around
nuclear weapon warfare will have EMP protection built into the design.
Newer current-technology military weapon systems have EMP-protection
required.

Even the TL6 stuff of the \'60s had some limited EMP protection.

Finally, the sky is blue because the Queen-Mother Goddess only had blue
crayons left when she colored in the world.

Myomers shure do exist;  contraction coefficients are armoun 2-5%, IIRC,
data from SciAm, about 3 years ago. Not viable for any major useage yet...
fragile, and not too strong.

>Any thoughts?

Well, I\'m not sure those worlds are representative of the Sylean Federation
at Dawn.  Other, old library data implies that the SF had control of much
of the Core (formerly Ukan sector) by President Zhunastu\'s tenure.  I got
the impression that those are the "Sylean Home Worlds" that were ruled by
the Emperor directly in the modern era.  Remember, at this point the Sylean 
federal government is 650 years old, which gives it much time to expand.
I know there was an incident at Fornol involving a 90000 ton starship on
diplomatic duties and an assassination with a robot, but I forget details.
Maybe there\'s more useful information there.  Does the _Atlas_ say anything
about the nature of the "Sy" allegiance code?

There are also some references that indicate active Sylean/Vilani contact
before Dawn, which may indicate a wider Sylean reach than some people may
be expecting.

Force Recon might be another story.

Reputation, sense of history and extreme levels of Espirt go along way to 
building the concept of marine eliteness, not to mention a damn tough

Much of this, I suspect, has to do with the style of training and high

I would expect that any Sapce Naval Service \'Marines\' would build very 
much on similar traditions and attitudes as their missions would be similar.

True.

Nope.

The PTRS-41 (Protivotankovoe Ruzh\'yo obr 1941g) was a 14.5mm anti-armor
rifle used by the Soviets in WWII.  It had a gas-operated semiautomatic
action that turned out to be pretty reliable under combat conditions.  The
design of this action was copied - scaled down, of course, to rifle calibers
for the SKS.

The 14.5mm cartridge that was used in the PTRS-41 later had a machinegun
designed around it.  That\'s the KPV.  But the KPV does not use the same
action design as the PTRS-41 (the PTRS-41 was an overgrown infantry rifle;
the KPV is a heavy machinegun).


ObTraveller: The "Crunch Gun" in the Path of Tears and RCES Equipment
Guide books is really a PTRS-41.  I know it for a fact, because I did
the design.

I\'ve posted the design sheet to the TML previously, so I\'ll not re-post.
If you\'ve got one of these in your campaign, it _is_ worth noting that FF&S
overstates it\'s mass quite considerably - the real thing was only about
22kg (including ammo) instead of the over 50kg given by FF&S.

At the correct weight, it\'s a very effective weapon for low-tech troops
to use against high-tech invaders equipped with Battle Dress and plasma
or fusion weapons.  Particularly if you can get in a position to
do long-range sniping.

You gave an excellent summary of why Virus can succeed. One more
important thing to remember is that it was a *plot device* used
to precipitate the sudden fall of an empire (admittedly already
on the brink of utter catastrophe anyway), so perhaps could be
allowed a bit of leeway. (ducks for cover...)

The only problem I detect with Virus is that there are allegedly
rules for its infecting *any* system it encounters (disclaimer: I
don\'t own TNE). Certainly there would be *some* systems that are
impervious to Virus. For instance, my home thermostat contains an
embedded controller, but there is no way to reprogram it. You may
be able to *physically* alter it, but that is a different issue.

One would hope that military systems in the far future would be
designed (with the aid of powerful computers) to repel virus
attacks. Certainly they need more powerful/complex computers,
but one would hope that only "trusted" computers would have the
last word on whether to decimate a planet. The same technology
that makes a sentient Virus possible would have been used to
verify that these computers are safe. And when all else fails,
there\'s always the big "OFF" switch.

That being said, it is feasible that the main Imperium, Solomani,
Zhodani, etc. fleets would all be vulnerable to Virus. The reason?
The "safe" mode of operation (let\'s call it "manual" even though
computers are involved) would have at least a slight disadvantage
versus a fully-integrated, fully-trusted system without security
precautions. Once a "fully automatic" ship has been compromised,
it may not be possible to eliminate the virus without a complete
computer shutdown and overhaul.

It is also possible that the government doesn\'t completely trust
the military and want to keep some back doors into their systems
(e.g., the access codes used in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan).

However, I still believe that ships implementing proper security
precautions should be safe from virus attacks (other than those
involving meson guns :-). For example, pirate ships should all
be virus-free :-).

The first is not true. I haven\'t proven it, but I doubt that the
thermal sensor on my thermostat poses a security risk.

The second is very true. If there is a way to control a system
externally (and electronically), Virus can probably use it.

Actually, plenty of large business, government, and even military
computers *have* been compromised by enterprising hackers. Very
few institutional computers are safe. Even firewalls, designed to
isolate whole networks by tightly controlling outside access, are
not completely safe.

Worse yet, many of the systems which we rely on every day could be
vulnerable to a concerted attack such as that of Virus. Phone and
electric companies are prime examples, as are banks, streetlights,
even car computers. Find a back door into these systems and you
could seriously upset a society overnight.

Yet systems on today\'s instruments of war (planes, ships, tanks,
etc.) are not likely to be vulnerable to virus attack. This is
due to the "trusted system" approach I already mentioned. If there
were a vulnerable system, the virus would be confined to it. In
addition, the pilot/captain/driver usually has the last word (and
the option to "pull the plug").

This, Derek, actually IS the Crunch Gun...that design was based on the 
Russian anti-tank gun (actually developed in the late 30\'s) and shows 
how badly flawed the small arms design sequence of FFS is, at many 
points.

These guns actually weighed in on the order of <30 kg max, WITH bipod.  
The Crunch gun IIRC had a BIPOD that weighed in at almost 30 kg! 
These are allegedly single man portable weapons...87.74 kg is just 
way too much.

	The problem lies in two places, with one cause...the designes are 
waaay over-engineered resulting in extremely heavy barrels and 
receivers, that are both too long for real-world checkable 
designs like this.

	I compared the Crunch Gun to it\'s nearest real world competitor that 
I could get the stats on, a Barret Browning .50 sniper rifle.  The 
Barret is 12.5 mm x75 mm, not 14.5 x 100 like the crunch gun, but 
with a bipod, minus scope it weighs in at <12 kg. A rifle only 
marginally larger in caliber, is supposed to weigh over 60 kg???

Warning...these numbers are off the top of my head, with neither 
Survival Margin or Janes Infantry Weapons in front of me.

OTOH, Gauss weapons seem way too light for the damage they do.  I 
know they\'re higher tech, but we don\'t use cast iron to make firearms 
anymore!

This is were we got off.  The message I replied to said nothing about the

Ya, I kinda figured that.  I\'ve got RCEG and when I first saw the rifle I 
thought, "Hey, I know that rifle."   Took me about three days to figure 
out what it was though.  I wasn\'t looking heavily.

NO KIDDING!!!  I\'m converting the Steyr AMR and it\'s got a weight of over 
80 kilo\'s.  I\'d convert parts of it to plastic but there\'s no weight 
savings.  Technically speaking the Crunch Gun is a better weapon while 
they\'re both hitting targets at an equivelent distance and the AMR has 
slightly better punching power the weight is rediculous.  It\'d take three 
guys to pack that sucker.

Part of me want to congratulate you for creating such an effective weapon 
and part of me want\'s to smack you upside the head for making something 
that got one of the character\'s in my team wacked. 8)

Well there really aren\'t rules.  The thing is the Virus was designed to 
be able to figure out and subvert any computer system it came across.  It 
was an adaptive living entity (according to the rules).  

See in the case of your thermostat the Virus would simply write it\'s code 
on the chip and leave it there waiting for someone to come alone and 
reactivate the system or caniblize the chip.  Technically speaking a 
Virus in a thermostat would never attain sentience and it\'d be dumb as a 
post if it did.

and make it really uncomfortable in here."

See in theory those computers systems would be next to impervious to a 
virus, I say next to because someone would figure it out.  But the thing 
is this Virus wasn\'t a program it was a spark of conciousness that 
expanded through the computer subverting all the program\'s contained 
there in, including engineering, lifesupport, weapons control etc.  The 
Virus could also subvert handheld diagnostic units and reprogram them to 
give false readings.

As for throwing the off switch, well that\'s kinda like throwing a plastic 
bag over someone\'s head, they\'re not just going to sit there and take it. 
 Because Virus is described as an entity, a conciousness, self 
preservation is one of the highest items on it\'s itinerary and if it has 
to play grav-pong with the crew that preforms maintenance then so be it. 
 There\'s plenty of people out there who can be coerced into doing 
maintenence.

In theory you\'d think this to be true however, because of the amount of 
time figuring out what the hell was going on.  And then transmitting that 
message along lines that had been long since compromised.  I beleive that 
if you look at Survival Margin p63 we see that the Virus is released on 
079-1130 Dulinor\'s fleet and many of Lucan\'s ships jump out of system 
immediately there after carrying the infection with them.  The final TNS 
bulletin, possessing no date but surely post 312-1130 (that\'s Noris\'s 
last transmission and the Virus bulletin comes after that).  Strephon\'s 
announcement comes 268-1130 and it\'s already compromised.  

That mean\'s that on the absolute inside, before any warnings are 
announce, Virus has had 189 days or 27 weeks to spread freely thoughout 
the Imperium.  From core sector at jump 4 that\'s enough time to cross 108 
parsecs.  Coreward that would put the Virus wave front on the farside of 
Meshan sector, Rimward that would but it just entering the Solomani Rim, 
Spinward, assuming the rift wasn\'t there it\'s already be at the border to 
the Trojan Reach, and Trailward it\'d be off the map.  Of course this is 
assuming the ship just jumps in and jumps out.  

Not likely to happen but even if you assume the ship to spend one week in 
system fooling around the distance that Virus would have travelled is 
immence, not to mention everytime an infected ship jumps in it infects 
everyship that it\'s transponder talks to, the downport and any 
communication points.  What this means is by the time Strephon\'s warning 
is posted 268 it\'s already spread so far it\'s too late, then when you 
think that warning has to be transmitted back through the system the 
carnage would be beyond the scale of human imagination.

Getting back to the orginal point.  You can\'t implement proper security 
measures against something you\'ve never encountered before or never even 
dreamed in your worst nightmare would come true.  When D.B. Cooper 
hijacked a plane in the 60\'s no one dreamed that someone would do 
something like that.  Now aday\'s they implement all kinds of security 
measures and at least once a year a plane is hijacked and once every five 
years a plane is blownup.  By the time the warning came it would be to 
late.  The messages you\'d been receiveing through the x-boat would start 
comming from closer and closer to home, with nothing but darkness behind 
that line until eventually the event would pass over your world and 
your lights would go out and the worse thing is the Virus had been there 
for months learning everything about your systems and how to best use 
them against you.

The problem that the Third Imperium had was it trusted it\'s computer\'s to 
be there for them, and one day they weren\'t and everything just fell 
appart.

Aaahh, not to start up a flame war or something, but could you please expound 
upon or clarify what you meant by this?  I have noticed that people with little 
or no military experience seem to think that the military and its individual 
members get some sort of thrill out of killing and destruction.  Beyond the 
normal teenage bravado of the young soldier (I\'m gonna kick their asses, cut 
their heads off and s**t down their throats), there is very little to support 
this belief.  

The US military, largely thanks to an uninformed and occasionally biased media, 
seems to have gotten this reputation in a larger way than other militaries.  
This is patently false.  For an excellent example of typical US military 
restraint, you need only look at the footage of the Serb-manufactured incident 
from the past weekend.  The US forces involved were clearly in danger, but bent 
over backwards to avoid unnecessary violence.  This was also the case in Iraq, 
where the vast majority of Iraqi losses were prisoners peacefully taken and 
humanely treated by US troops.

Sorry to get on my high horse here, but this sort ofthing tends to really get 
my goat.  I served four years as a commissioned officer, and many of my friends 
are still in the service.  What seems routine and ordinary to me is a relative 
unknown to many others, and because of that it is far too easy to fall into 
prejudices, stereotypes and outright lies.

Based on your previous posts, David, I don\'t think you\'re trying to attack 
anyone or anything, but I feel it necessary to rebut these sorts of statements 
whenever the opportunity arises.  The military (US or otherwise) are not 
perfect, but for the most part they are not ogres either.

I was thinking along the lines of some economies not having free-floating 
currency.  Perhaps put some on the gold standard (or somesuch) and make 
others with state-mandated exchange levels.  Still others could have 
exchange going only one way (from other currencies to theirs, but not 
from theirs to others).  Exchange can be a fascinating study, I just 
never took the opportunity to apply it to play.

That\'s weird, but it works!  :)  Geez, this sets up all sorts of

Not to mention that the pulse itself could fry humans if powerful enough.
The (modest) 24-nm radar onboard my boat boasts huge warnings about being
too close to the emitter.  Imagine being _inside_ one (i.e. your ship).

Perhaps, but the great expansion began with the widespread use of TL 12 by
the Imperium.  In the years before dawn, traders were probably scattering
throughout Core and Fornast Sectors.  But if you look at the MT Imperial
Encyclopedia, inside cover, the "Wars of the Imperium" map shows the Vilani
Pacification Campaign to be a huge affair.  I\'m curious though, where do we
see pre-Dawn contact between the SF and the Vilani?

HEPlaR missiles.  I still have a problem with the cost of the electronics
for even a relatively useful fighter.  I would like for them to be cheap
and deadly, but to put in any electronics at all costs LOTS of MCr.  Also
folding arrays are not supposed to be used when maneuvering, and a fighter
would be maneuvering all of the time if it wanted to live.

I could see fighter being used in a sleep mode.  Turning off all
unnecessary electronics, and coasting up on the enemy ships.  Then
blasting in when they are detected at high accelerations, then firing
large "torpedoes" into the enemy battleships.  I would see a "torp" as a
5Td missile with something like a 20G5  acceleration (meant to be launched
relatively close).  The last turn would spend something like 10G on
evasive maneuvers to get in close then either use a HUGE HE warhead, or
let loose a cloud of bolts.  This would maximize the ability to get on
target and get a hit, and 5Td is not all that much larger than .5Td in the
space combat.

BTW: this makes a fighter a "Ship of the Line Killer", so defending
against them becomes more important.

Also what I was thinking was to mount a smaller main laser that has a
higher ROF, but is designed to take on smaller ships, and vehicles.  It
might take multiple strafing runs to really hurt that Far Trader, but then
again from a corsair standpoint that may be just the ticket.

That\'s the problem!  I\'d rather spend my $250 buying all those T4
modules. If it were $100, it might be worth it.

I tried to play with the demo this weekend, but didn\'t get very far.
The interface isn\'t intuitive.  I couldn\'t seem to find a way to draw
to scale, and the objects available for placement in the demo weren\'t
the sort of thing you\'d use for deckplans.

I\'m pretty sure CC is an adaptation of an old version either FastCad
or EasyCad. Maybe it\'s very powerful, but not for somebody like me
that isn\'t familar with CAD type programs.

I\'ll keep playing with the demo...maybe it\'ll grow on me.  

>It seems like one would need two of the modules for completeness,
putting the pricetag over $100, but I can\'t be sure.

Or more.  I\'m not buying *today*, but like I said maybe it\'ll grow on
me.  There was mention on their webpage about a windows version
coming, that might be easier to deal with.

Actually, the problem is worse than that.  The equations in FF&S are just a
rough (and probably linear) fit, while the reality is a lot more complex.
For large, high-energy weapons, FF&S gives results that are far too big and
heavy, while for small, low-energy weapons FF&S gives results that are far
too small and light.  Try running a Colt Detective Special (a very small,
concealable .38 Special revolver) or even worse, a High Standard .22LR target
pistol, through FF&S and see what you get.

If it\'s any consolation, I originally submitted the design to GDW as an
examble of how badly broken the FF&S design system is.  They published it
instead.   The design is a reasonable response to a threat presented in the
game world.  Relatively lightly-armored infantry are vulnerable to
anti-armor rifles, and in a guerilla or insurgency type of operation,
slug-throwers can be very effective.

I _think_ it would be possible to play min/max rules with FF&S and
design a more effective weapon: you could optimize the energy by taking
advantage of barrel length and the energy-to-DV conversion\'s breakpoints.
Leave off the bipod (and perhaps fit it with a tripod instead - while the
bipod mass is based on muzzle energy, tripod mass is based on weapon mass,
and would probably come out _lighter_ than a bipod for high-energy rifles).

I\'ve never gotten around to doing this, but it might be fun to try.

I also noticed that the RC Equipment Guide published a set of battle dress
that was specifically armored enough to withstand the ball ammunition from
the Crunch Gun.  While that makes sense, it also means that the DS
ammunition will start showing up, with results that aren\'t very pleasant.

I meant to write, but never got around to it, an adventure scenario
outlining all of the truly nasty things a low-tech force could do against a
RCES-like invader.  While it might not be enough to win any battles, it
would certainly be possible to make occupation and pacification ugly and
unpleasant for the RCES - hopefully enough that they would just give up and
go home.  Then again, I never liked the RCES.

Myomer fibers are basically long strings of polyacetylene.  They do 
expand and contract depending on the amount of electrical current flowing 
through them.  I\'ve got no definite information, but I doubt that the 
current myomer technology is mature.  Of course, in the Far Future, it 
probably will be.

There WAS that unfortunate incident at Twentynine Palms a while back...

I\'m in the Army myself, so I\'m not qualified to comment on the entire 
body of USMC tradition, mindset, etc..  However, I have worked with them 
during joint exercises, and did notice that they were just about 
fanatical when it came to accounting for their people.  Naturally, all of 
the services, Army included, work personnel accountability into their 
training and operations just so that nobody gets left behind, but the 
Marines suffer the least "It Can\'t Happen to Us" mindset of all of them.  
Hell, they took better care of a couple of Army pukes than the Army 
often does.

Considering that, in the Traveller universe, Marine operations have the 
highest risk of personnel loss (taking a planet is a heck of a lot harder 
than keeping one), this higher degree of importance placed on personnel 
accountability will probably still exist.  Probably the only time that 
Marines (in the Traveller universe) will be left behind (wounded or not) 
is when there is nobody left to pick them up (the entire force has been 
destroyed).

My .2c on the matter.

The Impirium in year 0 will be imposing a new callender for all member 
worlds, as well other Imperial standards. One of which will be th value 
of the Imperial credit. 

The situation with member states using this new monetary system will be 
chaotic, mainly because of communication lags. The system we have now 
(where currency is speculated on in terms of percieved supply and demand 
of different currency) is truely unworkable (news that can have influence 
on currency prices will be a minimum 7 days old, progressing longer as 
you leave Capital/Core). 

So, a compramise must be reached. We know that Cleon and his successors 
got a kick out of Iridium, so why not make  the Imperial Credit = 1 gram 
of Iridium?

Local currencies can either be pegged to the Imperial Credit, while 
others can be based on the demand for thier currency on the open market. 
As long as the Imperial Credit is locked, the free wheeling of member 
states can continue, but Interstellar trade can be compared to a standard.

They don\'t help with the induced voltage. The reason for lots of turns

Actually, there\'s a lot of gear that will hardly notice an EMP.
Thermionic devices (aka "tubes" or "valves") will at worst just
equalize potential vias a spark and then continue working.

Semiconductors are vulnerable because the juntions are equivalent to a
capacitor with a *really* low plate seperation. The high voltage
destroys the junction. It require almost no current to do this (thus
the precautions against static electricity).

Not true. For example, the ignition in an automobile is not afected
noticeably if it is the old style coil-condenser-rotor type. Modern
units are vulnerable, because the parts are susceptible to high voltage
at the wrong places. An old fashioned electric stove would still work,
but the clock might not. Etc..

One little known technology developed specifically to be immune to EMP
was TIMMs (Thermally Integrated Micro Modules). They used "old"
technology. Specifically tubes, resistors, inductors and capacitors.
The tubes were flat cylinders about the size of a dime. The outer rim
was the anode, the center was the cathode. Any grids were circles of
"bars" between the anode and cathode. There was no filament. The tubes
were made of things like tungsten and tantalum. Ditto for the inductors
wiring and capacitors. Insulation was ceramic. 

These things were constructed as solid blocks, in 3D. The only empty
spaces were the vacuum in the tubes. And they were pretty small. They
were extremely rugged. They dispensed with the need for filaments to
heat the cathodes of the tubes (that\'s how most tubes fail) by heating
the whole module to a dull red heat! This wasn\'t that hard as on
shipboard you can afford the insulation and slight extra power drain.
And onboard airplanes, you have a ready source of both heat and power
in the jet engines.

These things are actually *less* bulky than pre-IC semiconductor
circuitry. While there are limits on how small you can make them (due
to limits on tubes), they\'d still be capable of being small enough to
let you replace a lot of electronic gear with them without much of a
penalty. (I suspect an IBM 360 equivanet could be built into something
the size of a refrigerator)

BTW, If you managed to create a computer capable of hosting the virus
using TIMMs, the virus couldn\'t infect the normal way. TIMMs operate at
a temp that\'d *kill* the virus. So it\'d have to re-write itself to run
on that processor, and trick the CPU into running it.

It\'s unlikely that these would be common, but some lower tech
civilizations might use them. They\'re a lot more resistant to radiation
than semiconductors, and for early ships they might be used instead of
semiconductors for the "dumber" parts of the system. They\'d go great
with the fission powered ship with the NERVA type engine.

I seem to recall reading about some polymers (or something like that)
that contracts under electrical stimulation. But it\'s way too delicate
and doesn\'t contract by all that much.

So we have something that might develop into myomers, but we don\'t have
them right now.

Tghe fibres would have to be a *lot* smaller than .5 mm. That\'s
equivalent to 50 dpi. And 50 dpi printing is pretty damned ugly.
Heck, my old RX-80 does .3 mm dots!

That\'s the rifle. I used to own one, but had to sell it. You forgot to

the action originally being developed for an anti-tank rifle.

I would recommend Corel 3. It iis currently listing for about $100, but
I have seen it for $69. If you can run the CD version, the fonts and
the vector-based clip art are worth it. They have included symbol fonts
for military symbols for those interested.

I would be willing to send *.cdr files of the deck plans symbols I have
made. Corel 3 also features layering. 

It is not as intuitive as Visio, but the ability to move points on a
line around is worth it.

Perhaps we could come up with a *library* of sorts. I also have some of
the TNE forms reproduced in Corel format. (I do not have ready access
to a copier, but I do have a laser printer.)

Good luck.

   In reality, a corn dog is prepared as follows: a hot dog or sausage
is shoved onto a wooded stick, dipped in batter (usually made with corn
[maize] meal), and then baked or fried.  The result is a meal (if you can
call it that) on a stick.

I\'ll trust you about the action.  I\'ve seen the rifle but I\'ve never 
owned one and I don\'t have a copy of Jane\'s to say either way.

The point I had a problem with was someone misidentified the SKS as 
firing 17mm ammo and "being" a wwII antitank rifle.

I\'m not sure about the barrel sequence.  90% of the Steyr AMR (that\'s 
what I\'m working on not the PTRS) is the receiver 81 KILOGRAMS!!!  I just 
about cr@pped my pants when my calculator spewed that one out, the bipod

pounds for a receiver and bipod.  I practically fell on the floor.

Let me tell you once you\'ve reached TL12 throw away all those old rifles 
and ETC weapons and switch to gauss.  I created a 4mm SMG with a 2.5cm 
SA-GL for TNE.  It weighed in a less than 8 kilo\'s with 100 rounds.  It 
was a brutal weapon.  And a 10mm Gauss is capable of preforming "Crunch 
Gun" penetration at a mere 17kg a trooper in battle dress could use that 
as a main weapon.  It had the integral 2.5cm SA-GL and a 25 round clip.  
This thing would tear through light battle dress and LSP PR-317 like they 
were wearing paper.

I beleive you\'re right about the Bipod / Tripod for heavy weapons.  I 
wonder, in light of earlier comments which I snipped out, if it to 
modifiy the receiver weight formula based on the muzzle energy.  IE if 
you have a muzzle energy of 30,000+ (use the same break points as the 
penetration values for ease of conversion) multiply the weight of the 
receiver by 0.33, or something like that.  Unfortunatly you\'d have to 
modify the recoil tables too, to account for the lighter weapons and not 
have a corosponding increase in recoil.

No shit.  We were wearing light battle dress at the time, when some 
goomba opened up on us with that thing.  

I think the thing is at shorter ranges the ball is a capable round, and 
at longer ranges the DS is capable of penetrating a Phyrus Support Sled. 
 It\'s a very capable weapon, a lot hefty, but still a very capable 
weapon.

Hey buddy your invader is my job!  Actually I\'ve only been involved in 
one serious smash and grab in over a year of gaming, we attacked a prison 
compound and retreived the crew of one of our ships.  Beyond that all of 
our missions have been intelligence gathering, survailence, and hearts 
and minds kind of missions.  I really think the whole smash and grab 
mission profile is over blown, it\'s something that gets press but most 
missions are low key.

Personally I think that the smash and grabs were put in to give all 
these Arnold movie action junkies something to hook onto.

Cool.  I\'m running Corel 4, actually more tinkering with it really.  I\'m 
trying to make some maps with it but if you\'ve got examples.  I\'ve 
received one example from chris cox but he\'s using Corel 6 and I can\'t 
take it appart and see how it was made so thats a bit of a problem.

Which forms have you got?  I had all of the map scales, planetary, 
continental, and  single hex.  Unfortunately I had my hard-drive go down 
and I lost them all.

Actually the Hiver Corndog is a parasitic worm that through pure 
conicidence when prepared looks just like a corndog.  A number of human\'s 
ate the things and when the Hiver\'s explained what they were, well you 
can guess the natural result.

1. The "Savannah"

The Encyc Brit says that the USSR built a civilian nuclear-powered
icebreaker, the *Lenin*, in 1957 (also the first nuclear-powered vessel,
ever). The next civilian nuclear-powered ship was the *Savannah*, built in
1962 (sponsered by the US AEC and Maritime Commission). It was a "modern
shelter-deck ship of 12,220 gross tons" (compare this to the *Queen
Elizabeth* liner at 83,673 tons).  It carried 60 passengers and made about
20 knots. However, it couldn\'t compete commercially. 

Another nuker was
the *Otto Hahn*, "operated in Germany by the Society for the Evaluation of
Nuclear Energy in Shipbuilding and Navigation" in the 1970\'s. The article
stated it had a smaller and more compact power plant, reducing the dangers
if a collision occurred. 

The section of the article concludes that the high initial cost and
difficulties in crew training have prohibited commercial usage of nuclear
power in shipping. 

All quoted text from: 
"Transportation", _The New Encyclopaedia Britannica_, 15th Edition (1993),
Vol 28, pp 854-5, Chicago, USA.

And of course they have _NukeAway_(tm) - wasn\'t our lack of this the
reason Mork wanted to leave Earth? 

2. Virus (again)

Another possible explanation for the rapid initial spread is to say that
more than one strain was released in the initial data transfer. Presumably
the strike team sent everything it could find. Certainly, if only the
Suicider had been released, the infection would have rapidly died out. How
about saying that a few strains were released, including the TNS version
to corrupt news broadcasts... 

3. ID4

>Patrick Stewart was watching it in the same theatre that I was in. 

You name-dropper! (BTW, I hope to meet Don Perrin this weekend!)

4. Orbital Navaids

These have been mentioned before in Traveller. Some are put up by the home
planet, some are maintained by the Imperial Starport Authority, some by
the Scouts, some by the Navy... 

"Canon" seems to suggest that the IISS sort of "fills in" if no-one else
is around, or for Scout-interdicted worlds. The Navy only worries about
Navy-interdicted worlds.  Home worlds can have a multiplicity of
satellites (eg our Earth now);  maybe one set is a standard Imperial
navaid network. 

5. Re: Humour

>The characters may have to deal with some worlds that are in the midst of
>a pneumonic plague or somesuch... 

Do you mean a mnemonic plague (causing loss of literacy - see that
thread), or a pneumatic plague (where people keep blowing up)? 

6. Hand Computers

These have been fully detailed in a number of DGP publications, including
one of those detailed handout equipment sheets. They do all the things Joa
wanted them to do.  Actually, I saw (and kept) an even better full-colour
pic for a hand computer, that was in an "Intel Inside" ad. I thought
someone from Intel had been reading Traveller. 

7. Money (was Hand Computers)

In Australia, the one- and two-cent coins have been phased out totally,
meaning that all the shops must round to the nearest five cents. The one-
and two-dollar bills have both been replaced by coins, and the five-dollar
is next. The two dollar coin is thicker than the one dollar, but
*smaller*. Weird. All our "paper" money ($5, $10, $20, $50, $100) has been
replaced with polymer notes that have the following features: 

- - denominations are coloured differently from each other;
- - clear "window" panels are incorporated into their design; 
- - micro-writing (writing with a resolution too small to be photocopied) is
used; 
- - the text and pictures are embossed on the note; 
- - a star with 3 points on one side of the note and 4 on the other, making
the complete star only visible when you hold the note up to the light; 
- - each denomination is 5mm longer than the next. 

The Reserve Bank boasts that ours is one of the most secure currencies in
the world.  Apparently the US has great problems with forgery. I\'ve seen
their notes, and I think that a photocopier could almost duplicate them
(apart from the green backs)! How do blind people tell them apart? all one
size, all one colour.  Mind-boggling! I\'m sighted, and I reckon that I\'d
pay $50 for a $1 cup of coffee, and not even notice until much later. 

And we have the largest number of ATM\'s per capita in the world. OK, all
you conspiracy theorists, is Oz a great social experiment to test out a
cashless society, or what? 

The reason for paper money (polymer money!) in Traveller is just as a plot
device;  it is the "McGuffin", the dilithium crystal, the gimmick, the
thing that everyone wants and that is tangible and easy to steal. For
example, the Amber Zone "Aces and Eights" states that merc units are
traditionally paid in hard cash.  However, the best reason the scenario
has for this is so that there is "hidden treasure"  that the PC\'s must go
and find. 

And James is correct; the "play-doh" polymer currency used in the Imperium
is described fully in the _Imperial Encyclopedia_ for MT. 

Bruce said: 

>My personal belief is that a \'hand computer\' will be actually a number of
>different devices each with different niches

Last year I saw a program where a computer exert said he had 6 chips on
him at that moment;  pocket calculator, cellular phone, pocket organiser,
pager, and two I can\'t remember. He stacked them on the desk and said; "In
two years, all of these will be in one device.  It will then take us
another two years to work out if they SHOULD all be in the one device, but
technology does allow us to integrate them". 

BTW, Joe, I hate to tell you, but my COBOL progs include century (had to,
needed to print a seven-year-in-the-future destroy date on certain
financial reports).

Now what did I mean by that? <thinks> This hearkens back to the "Yanks in
Space" theme of a few months ago. It\'s all stereotyping, BTW, due in no 
small part to a biased media (eg. Walter Kronkite in \'Nam during the Tet 
Offensive. This was actually the worst thing, militarily, that the VC 
could have done. After all, exposing themselves meant they made 
themselves targets - "all the better to shoot at, my dear". But Walter 
saw it as a failure on the US side).

However, there are also the following few things:
- - my grandfather-in-law, in the RAF in WW2, trained with his unit and 
some US units.  The US guys saw a bush move and shot at it (yes, using 
live ammo). Turned out that one of their guys had snuck off for a pee, 
and they had shot him dead. Yes, this is in *training* (seriously, even 
training is dangerous - just look at our Blackhawk crash a few weeks ago. 
Military equipment is not a pile of toys).
- - tactics in Vietnam were to split the unit, with each side executing a 
pincer movement. However, often the ends of the pincer, when closing, 
fired at themselves, thinking they were VC. Dangerous.
- - one US encampment practice that annoyed the locals was to camp in the 
centre of a village. The Aussies, meanwhile, camped half a mile *outside* 
the village. They reported that you didn\'t go *anywhere* near the US camp 
at night - they would shoot first and ask questions later.
- - then there was that whole thing with the village that was almost wiped 
out (sorry, can\'t remember the name, saw a US documentary on it years ago 
and was horrified). One poor soul remembered shooting a woman in the 
back, then realising that the round had gone through her and also killed her 
son that she had been running away with. This ex-soldier now takes bulk 
anti-depressants, etc, and can\'t live with his guilt.
- - and in Iraq, many people (including some Brits in an APC) discovered that 
version of Murphy\'s Law: "Friendly fire... isn\'t".

I\'m glad that the forces in Bosnia showed restraint. I think that is 
great (not to mention showing great courage in adhering to rules of 
engagement, even if you put yourself in danger). I guess all I was trying 
to say was that the attitude attributed to the Impy Marines is a lot 
like the stereotyped view of US forces.

Can we create a better view? One thing missing from the Impy forces is a 
surgical strike force (as opposed to a blunt - sorry, Big - stick). I 
think we need an SAS-style force. Or is that what the 4518th was meant to be?

In fact iit is (all but) beaten into you in bootcamp - the living are not 
left, and the bodies are not if there is any choice. There have been 
(recollection hazy since it has ben 20 years ....) instances where the 
number of casualties was increase significnatly by this attitude.  It was 
used against us in the Pacific WWII and Veitnam.  But the bonding effect 
is alomost unbelievable.

I believe that the legion has similar attitudes.

Add that to a training progarm that makes you do things that you KNOW are 
not physically possible and you get elite mindset.

That would be the way I would play it.

Also I would have Marine fighter jocks  have a skill level in ground tactics
to simulate the equivalent to the current requirement (at least as of 1970\'s)
that marine piolts had to take the marine platoon leaders training course.

Theory was (and anecdotal evidence seems to support it) that people who 
have been in command on the ground are more attunned to the mudfeet needs 
when flying cloase air support.

Many Marines I knew who were in Nam had horror stories about close air 
flown by non marine piolts -- esp Air force (not so much based on the 
rivalry issues -- one of them told me it was not due to lack of skill or 
desire on the AF part it was lack of training for that role and a lack of 
mudfoot perspective which caused them to dump their l;oads from as high 
as they could get away with.  In contrast I heard a story (maybe even 
true) about a navy phantom jock who burned out a bunker complex  by 
flying a low pass and going nose up and dumping afterbuner on it.

Hope it\'s not to off topic.

A corn dog is just a hot dog on a stick, covered with corn batter and fried.  
Really nasty things, but every now and then an uncontrollable urge comes along 
and I am forced to buy and eat some quantity of the things.  I\'ve seen them in 
Mexico also, but not in Europe anywhere.  What other countries have these 
things?

BTW - In case you need to know, a hot dog is sort of a non-spicy sausage.  It 
is usually boiled or broiled, and served on a bun smothered in condiments like 
mustard, ketchup, relish, etc.  Since you have never done anything to offend me 
or hurt my friends, I will be kind and not mention what they are actually made 
of.

Presumably he was referring to the reputation the US armed forces have.
They tend to be seen as over-zealous, with a fondness for excessive
violence.

Very true. However, it\'s also true that the US military caused as many
Coalition causalties as the Iraqis.

We\'ve got Corel 4 at work, and I bought a copy of Corel 3 for home use
sometime back.  It was for work purposes, but I never did much with
it.

I\'m definately interested!  I\'ll pull the Corel CD back out and
reinstall it.

This is the problem, from the limited playing I\'ve did with CorelDraw,
it\'s as bad as any CAD program I\'ve tried.  I\'m sure it\'s perfectly
intuitive for people that are used to it, but for me anything more
complex than Windows Paintbrush is over my head.  <g>

It seems to me that Visio, Corel, and most other programs can import
and export to the same basic formats..isn\'t that right?  Symbols,
forms and backgrounds could be put into transportable formats and
shared.  Frankly, if it\'s in a format that can be displayed on the
PC\'s screen, it can be captured and converted.

I polled a number of folks that might be in my pbem and they *all*
prefer raster formats:  BMP, GIF, JPG, PCX.  Well actually, one poor
guy prefered ASCII.  <g> Nobody said they could handle vector
drawings, so no matter what I use to draw maps and deckplans, I\'ll
have to convert them before sending them out.

Last night I spent a couple of hours playing with a friend\'s hand
scanner.  He got it from SAMS for under $100.  With a scanner I could
draw the deckplans on paper and *scan* the darn things in!  Finally
finding a use for that \'B\' in drafting I got way back in high school.

It wasn\'t Hiver larvae that looked like corn dogs: it was an annelid which
was a major and economical food source for Hiver client species (and
Hivers? Do they still eat only fungus?), which the Ithklur particularly
enjoyed fried in batter.  Corn dogs were thus welcomed as a "slice of home"
in the midst of a long diplomatic excursion through foreign parts.  The
Ithklur felt so comfortable they even tried to participate in some combat
ballet....  :-)

Well, I could get out my economics book and give you the technical reasons
why most countries are off the gold standard, but....

Look at it this way.  What happens if the fledgling Imperium suddenly makes
a major iridium strike in some planetoid belt, causing the price of iridium
to plummet?  What happens if the supply of iridium is too restricted for the
needs of the economy?  This is even more likely to hurt a small Imperium than
a large one.  Bad news.  Let the credit "float".

I agree with this.  If we look at the Bretton Woods/gold standard, when
you pegged one currency to a metal standard, all of the other currencies
were then pegged against that currency.  So, though trading, arbitrage,
and balance of payments, a smaller trading partner could actually ask
for a significant amount of metal (since gold and silver notes are
eligible for a one-to-one exchange).  This severely depreciates the
pegged currency and can cause severe depressionary effects.  This is
especially true if the trading currencies don\'t hold their peg against
the "standard."

Okay, so I\'m an econ major--sue me!  8)

To put it in really simple terms, the amount of money running around is
way more than what any country has in it\'s metal reserves (both gold and
silver).  This is because many times countries need to print more money
(even though this is inflationary).  It\'s much better to just stick the
the comparative value of the currency (2 dollars = 1.6 pounds = 2 DM)
etc.  With electronic banking, there\'s no need to physically exchange
anything, and you\'re basically exchanging on the value of a country\'s
economy and not how much they have in the bank.

This probably wouldn\'t happen.  Look that the diamond cartel.  If the

being held back to create an artifically high price because of demand,
cubic zircona would be more expensive than diamonds (well, this is
stretching it a little, but you get the idea).

Actually, the concept behind the Imperial hard currency comes from
an ancient Roman technique for mass-producing "junk" jewelry.
The artisan would make a bundle of colored glass rods in a particular
pattern, fuse them together and slice off dozens of identical brooches
or whatever.

Marc or Frank or me (I forget who after 12+ years) thought this was
a novel approach to currency. I don\'t recall ever specifying a .5mm
thickness for the individual fibers...that\'s a lot thicker than I had
in mind. Perhaps the typesetter\'s slipped a decimal place or two.

Hmmm...when I asked Dave, he said that the consumables in question were

I believe there are better ways of handling currency besides pegging them 
to a rare metal.  There are so many disadvantages to that...

Neat!  Thanks for sharing that with us.  It\'s always nice to know the 
thinking behind the decisions (large, small, and in-between) that shaped 
our favorite RPG. :)

If you can spend a few more moments with us, I\'ve a couple of questions 
for you.  First, in reading JTAS I have noticed that a great deal of the 
material was produced by a small number of people (JTAS remains one of my 
favorite RPG items to re-read).  Did the articles produced by the main 
contributors (including yourself, of course) tend to reflect the nature 
of the campaigns they ran?  For instance, one article in particular that 
I enjoyed very much was "Speculation Without a Starship," which was 
written by you and appeared in issue 5.  Did your campaigns have an 
emphasis on trade?  Or were the articles done in a more systematic 
fashion? 

My other question is one that I\'ve wondered about for quite some time.  
Who wrote the Traveller News Service section?  How far in advance were 
TNS-announced events planned?  And, did the folks at GDW play the events 
announced out before writing about them (for example, the events leading 
up to the Fifth Frontier War)?  [Oops...I asked more questions than I 
said I would...sorry!:)]


Thank you in advance for your time,

- -Joe

I agree a floating Imperial credit is probably best, but I also like
the idea of putting some Iridium in each Imperial Credit.  It makes a
nice touch, what with the Iridium Throne and all.

However, there are complications in relation to the Imperium scenario.

First, there\'s communication lag.  Transactions in one part of the
Imperium are tied *very* loosely to the rest of the empire.  It would
be impossible to float the credit across hundreds of parsecs and not
have its value vary from place to place, and time to time.  The cargo
of boojam you bought at Lois IV for 14cr/ton is worth 14cr/ton on Lois
IV...on Johnson III it can be sold for 21cr/ton.  Is this a difference
in the *worth* of boojam...or is it a localized and transient
difference in the *worth* of the credit?  Are there too many credits
piled up on Johnson chasing available goods?  

Second, the Imperium is modeled (it seems to me) on mercantile empires
rather than capitalism.  Similar empires in our past where strongly
tied to a centralized authority working on a gold standard. Their goal
was to exploit the periphery pulling wealth into the center from where
the oligarchy ruled.

Thirdly, once firmly established the 3rd Imperium\'s trade was almost
all internal.  Trade with various nations was never emphasized.  Sure
there was some of it, but I don\'t think it was major.  Because of
this, the Imperium might have thought it could afford to fix the value
of the credit.

Therefore, I theorize that the Imperium didn\'t float it\'s currency,
but rather based it on a \'gold standard\'..although iridium is
tempting.  <g> Perhaps the "long night" can be explained as a massive
economic depression brought on by the contact with the Terran
Confederation.  Certainly, the "long night" didn\'t hit for hundreds of
years after contact, and after the Solomani takeover in fact, but the
Imperium is HUGE and it would take centuries for the effects to spread
and rebound.  Even the conquest of the 1st Imperium could be blamed on
sweeping economic destabilization brought on when the inflexible
Vilani ran into the Solomani.

Folks, if you want to know the truth, I doubt an empire the size of
the Imperium could be put together and endure very long.  Travel and
communication times are just too long.  It would have to *very* loose,
more Commonwealth (if not Common Market) than Empire.  I\'d say a few
sectors would be about the largest *maintainable* size, maybe a couple
of months to travel from an edge to the center.

How\'s this for a new topic to discuss? <g>

I\'m not sure if either model is very accurate.  I think the best way to
think of the Imperium is at a trade union (similar to the EU/EC).  It\'s
many smaller economies that are treated as one big on when dealing with
other large economies.

That\'s true, and this is why I was saying that communication lag doesn\'t
matter.  Trade takes place between worlds.  Each world has it\'s own
currency and economic strength.  Now, the basis of how strong the local
world\'s economy is is what\'s pegged against the Imperial Credit.  This
is similar to the EuroDollar.  The Imperium creates a common currency
that makes transactions between member states easier.

So, an Imperial credit is an Imperial credit is an Imperial credit.
It\'s there and it in effect is the standard.  It\'s just a standard of
accounting.  The real pegging and floating comes from the member worlds
who want their currency to buy more Imperial credits and thus be worth
more when trading with other worlds.

The reason for this is also quite simple.  You start withn 11 worlds and
then work your way up to 11,000.  That\'s a lot of iridium that you\'ll
have to find.  8)

The Third Imperium was only partially centralised. Each Grand Duke was a 
king in his own right, taking cues and vuage directions from 
Capital/Core, and implememting them in his Domain. If there was an 
oligarchy, it was a 2 tiered one.

Remenber that a floated doller is based on perceptions, not facts and not 
figures. Someone percieves that a currency is changing value, he acts on 
it, making a change in its value. How can you do this when even in Year 
0, there is up to a six month timelag on communications? The perception 
one would get about a value for a currency is based on assumptions, 
guesses and infomations that _must_ be obsolete even when it was sent via 
the x-boat system.

IMHO, the Imperium is based on three empires, two of which are fictional. 
1) the Roman Empire, was established in a blaze of glory, then took 1000 
years to completely collapse. They too had communication problems (which 
they solved by roads), and they too had a currency based on the gold 
standard (which was easier then, as mercantile science was just passing 
the barter stage).

2) Asimov\'s Impirium. The Trantor Empire was barely touched on by Asimov 
himself, using its rise and collapse as a plot device to tell his story. 

3) Niven & Pournelle First and Second Imperium. Again only a plot device 
(we do see more on its creation with Pournelle and Sterlings "Prince of 
Sparta series" 

Since a lot of inspiration for Cleon\'s Imperium was fictional, 
the game designers could put together any explanation on how the empire 
worked. Because they would only be concerned with telling a story.

Isn\'t that interesting!  Over here in the USA, a Dagwood is a
extraordinarily thick sandwich...so thick you can\'t get a bite of the
whole thing at once.  It\'s named after a comic strip character,
Dagwood Bumstead.

That\'s just it, there really *aren\'t* other large economies that the

I\'ve always had more fun when I divide an area up into smaller

military competition, economic competition is just as good..gamewise.

It didn\'t help that just about every system was wired into computers 
somehow (just look at the massive computer integration that was built 
into pre-Collapse starships), and almost everything was built according 
to widely-disseminated design standards (the Imperial Data Package) which 
were also built into the Virus program.  According to "Survival Margin", 
the first-generation Virus basically had the blueprints on everything 
from mechanical pencils to jump drive relay governors.  Of course, I 
don\'t even want to BEGIN to theorize about what the hell a Virus-infected 
system could do with a mechanical pencil...

There doesn\'t seem to be any injunction in the Brilliant Lances rules for 
maneuvering with your passive array extended, but I could have missed 
it.  I definitely wouldn\'t allow a ship to enter any sort of atmosphere 
with the array extended, though.

I haven\'t done too many finished fighter designs, but the one\'s I\'ve put 
a little bit of work on had room for plenty of missiles.  My idea of a 
heavy fighter would have a good electronics package (which does tend to 
drive the price up), one high-output, high ROF laser, and an internal 
rotary missile launcher (kinda like in B-1 and B-2 bombers).  The key to 
effective fighter ops would be getting close enough (probably while the 
enemy\'s capital ships are being distracted by your own cruisers and 
battleships) to launch a whole slough of missiles and get the hell out as 
you\'re guiding them to their targets, while not giving the enemy a lot of 
time to defend against the incoming warheads (or evade them).  Even with 
the good old High Guard rules, building massive carriers (like the ones 
presented in the Fighting Ships supplement) didn\'t seem like such a keen 
proposition given the low survivability of fighters in the face of other 
capital ships, especially when some of them could pull just as many G\'s 
as a fighter could.

Unless fighters can get close enough to capital ships using their smaller 
sensor cross-section (being smaller and, therefore, harder to spot) to 
where their weapon systems and maneuverability make up for the fact that 
they\'re within the killing range of a larger and slower target, there\'s 
no point to having them.  Sure, you could use standoff weapons that don\'t 
require the fighters to get close but then, considering how much they 
cost, why have them?

In order to make fighters worthwhile in the Traveller universe, you need 
to find a niche for them in the space combat spectrum of operations where 
they are actually a better alternative to larger, more heavily armed ships.

But, then again, so would a more heavily armed trader, in order to make 
the piracy operation worthwhile.  Of course, that\'s a whole other can of 
worms that I\'d rather not open right now.

It\'s no sillier than the foods of a lot of human cultures. I\'m told
witchety(sp) grubs are delicious. Ditto for well aged eggs, and guinea
pig. But I\'d rather not be told what I\'m eating until *after* I\'ve
tasted it.

BTW, the Chinese consider cheese to be "rotten milk". So be careful
about your food prejudices.

   Who to blame: U.S. Grant, Phil Sheridan, but most of all, Clausewitz,
who\'s writings on how to conduct warfare were studied extensively
by the two aforementioned gentlemen.

   Americans believe that by acting swiftly and violently, you actually
save the lives of many of your soldiers who otherwise would become
victims of a war of attrition.

   I think if there seems to be a bias, it is because you have people who
are patently ignorant about a subject, trying to report it from a
perspective that they think people back home can understand.  Imagine
a hard news reporter trying to write a review of a play at the local
theatre, or trying to cover a horse backriding event.  I don\'t recall seeing
an on-camera reporter who didn\'t look or sound as though they were
totally out of their element while they were doing their bit for the camera
from the airbase/ship/war zone/front/etc.

   For truly biased reporting, you have to look at 60 Minutes, or other
``so-called`` weekly electronic news magazine type programs.  I no
longer watch 60 Minutes, but if you believed them, the M-1 main battle
tank was a piece of crap (it turned out to be the best tank in the world,
perhaps the best tank ever), and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle was a
death trap (again, wrong).

>Very true. However, it\'s also true that the US military caused as many
>Coalition causalties as the Iraqis.

   You\'re missing the point.  It wasn\'t that the number of ``friendly fire``
incidents were that high, it was that the number of causalties the Iraqis
could inflict on US and Coalition troops were so low.

  And if we\'re going to do a body count, let\'s count the number of
Coalition (and Iraqi) troops that are still alive today because the war was
brought to a swift and decisive end by Schwarzkopf (American
general), and not allowed to drag out month after bloody month.

   I\'d follow-up by giving everyone a complete analysis of Operation
Market-Garden by way of contrast, but I sense the total boredom some
of you are now feeling and will conclude the Military Science lecture for
today.

Harold

Once you wade through the technical hand-waving, the REAL reason 
most countries are off the gold standard is so that they can rob 
the populace through inflation and deficit spending.

No, I imagine he means "pneumonic plague", the extremely 
contagious respiratory-infecting variant of The Plague (the 
ever popular "Pastuerella pestis", repeat engagements throughout 
the Middle Ages, opening act "Dying black rats"...) 
 
There are three known forms of plague, in order of increasing 
rarity and lethality: bubonic, pneumonic, septicemic. Bubonic 
plague is named for the black swellings, or "buboes" that are its 
classic symptom.  This form is spread by flea bite only.  
Pneumonic plague is respiratory infection, and is an airborne 
contagion--if you cough, you spread it around.  Septicemic 
plague attacks the bloodstream, IIRC, and is lethal very fast. 
I don\'t know about contagion with this variant.  All caused by 
Pasturella pestis, and IIRC, an individual can manifest a 
different form of the disease than the one he was infected by. 
 
Aren\'t you glad to know all this?

have at 35km/s. I thought the numbers looked *way* too high, but only had
the "5km/s equals the equivalent weight in TNT" *rule of thumb* to go by.
I finally looked it up, and here are the numbers:

o 1 ton tnt = 4.173e+9 joules = 4173MJ
o 10g wing nut at 35km/s = 6.125MJ kinetic energy (KE) (this was correct)
o 6.125MJ = 0.00147 tons TNT = 1.47 kg TNT

I think the numbers given were in tons (or was it megatons?) of TNT,
rather than 1.47 kg (just over 3 lb). A 500 ton (metric mass) ship would
be equivalent to a little over 73 kilotons of TNT (about 3e8 MJ) at that
speed (try it--KE=0.5mv**2). At 0.1c (30000 km/s), the ship\'s KE is over
2.25e14 MJ (54 gigatons TNT), but let\'s not bring that up again! :-) :-)

The rule of thumb seems to be off by a factor of 3--I guess meteors at
that speed tend to be 2/3 gone by the time they hit dirt. For those of
you playing around with anti-matter bombs, note that if 1 kg of matter
were *completely* converted to energy (i.e., E=mc**2), it would produce

No problem, Eris, I agree.

I still have an interesting q that arose from this: in your opinions, 
what does a high-tech surgical strike team consist of? Is it:
- - a bunch of guys in battledress (a la _Starship Troopers_);
- - an elite infantry commando (to take out Navarre, for eg.);
- - an elite mech infantry force, that glides in using grav APC\'s, busts up 
the target, and glides out again?

Are there other options?

Also, I\'ve noticed that the US government is concerned 
that the smart weapons from the Gulf War may have been more expensive 
than their targets (although are the factoring in the benefit of making 
their ground forces safer??). Is the economic line a major factor when 
weighing what forces to use against what targets?

As far as I can see there\'s no way you can solve this problem if you stick
to Real Science. Fortunately I\'ve never been too hung up on Real Science.
It\'s a nice thing in its place, because it helps create consistency in
your game (and consistency is something I consider _very_ important). But
if sticking to reality is going to mess up my game, sod reality. And
really, with what I hear on the radio each morning about the bevaviour of
some of my fellow human beings, I\'d sooner believe in some Unreal Physics
than believe that "Well, people just don\'t do that sort of thing...". My own
suggestion would be to retroactively invent some TL 11-12 force field that 
(Rubber Science alert!) used sub-space (the underlying whatsit that thruster
plates "thrusts" against, you know) as a heat sink. Make it so expensive
that only high-population worlds can afford it. This has the added 
benefit of cutting their much too big naval budgets down to a managable size.
Perhaps down o a level where they fit in with what we\'ve been told about
the sizes of various navies.

All wars have "friendly fire" incidents.  The Gulf War ones stood 
out because there were so few casualties caused by enemy fire. 
Face it, you\'re in a environment where people are running around 
with loaded weapons and shooting them at each other!  War zones 
are dangerous places to be.

Well, my husband keeps quoting pieces of "A Bridge Too Far" by  
Cornelius Ryan at me as he re-reads it, so I don\'t think I need 
the review.  I\'m sorry, but they should\'ve let Patton run things,

Well, Rome actually stumbled into empire, first struggling for survival
against the Italian city-states, then against the last of the Greek
successors nearby, then against the Carthaginians, then the Gauls,
then...well, everyone else. (Sure, this is simplified. But you get the
idea). In this respect, I saw Rome as more of an Asimovian Foundation than
Empire. :-)

Up to the middle of the second century AD, the Roman state was still plenty
strong. The collapse of the Western empire took three centuries following
that. The Eastern half still had glory days up until the middle of the 11th
century (the Nikephorian Byzantine army was perhaps the finest of the time,
and is VERY underated by non-historians).

When Traveller first came out, I certainly based my campaigns on the Asimov
Empire. Well, that and the Star Wars one, of course. As more info came out
in the JTAS and (in particular) the Fifth Frontier War era of publications,
it became clearer that this was not the case. With a relatively benevolent
Imperium, I found adventures harder to come by.

But the whole point of the Imperium was to protect the member states
from the turban-heads, toons, doggies, ponies, and starfish.  You could
argue that the Imperium may have set guidelines for trading with their
neighbors, but I think that\'s the main point of the Imperium is that of
a  unifying force that protects the members that support it.

Rarity of a commodity that can be traded is the dictionary definition of
money.  The economic one simply states that it has to be regulatable and
widely acceptable.  Hence the reason little green pieces of paper with
dead mens\' faces have value.

But that\'s exactly what Traveller does.  Look at how the Marches get
picked on for being "backwater?"  What about Margaret\'s domain where she
was looking at expanding trade into regions not in the Imperium?  Or how
about the Aslan (they really must get better real-estate agents)?

Gee, once again Loren saves the day.  No, to answer Loren\'s question, Dave
didn\'t change his mind.  The Hiver "corndog" is a sea cucumber used as food.
I don\'t know where all these other ideas come from, but the sea cucumber
idea is from Sneaks and Geeks.  The reference to "corndogs" in SM is from
the Hivers tour of Diaspora before the collapse.  The Hiver had some food
they were served that they brought with them and when the humans saw it they
thought they were "corndogs."  At one of the next stops on the Hiver Tour,
the humans prepared some real corndogs for the Hiver which, when they ate,
made them very ill.  Apologies were offered all around and the Hiver
explained the true nature of their "corndog" and, well, you can immagine how
the humans that had eaten some of them felt!

This brings me to another point, though.  I\'ve been reading a number of
complaints about the "corndog" joke that ruined an already bad alien module,
namely Hiver & Ithklur.  Then I read the few posts of the "experts"
explaining the "corndog" issue to others.  I personally enjoyed Hiver &
Ithklur very much.  I don\'t have any DGP material to compare it with, so I
can\'t comment on the comparison, but I can comment on H&I.  I get a little
irritated at people who discount a plot device (Virus) or a book (H&I) or
anything else without really understanding what they are talking about.  It
amazed me how few people knew the subtleties of Virus as illuminated in SM,
and again I am amazed at how few people understand the "corndog" issue that
they complain about.  H&I presented the life of both Hiver and Ithklur.
"Corndogs" are a part of that life.  Life is funny if you know where to
look.  I think some people just take this game a bit too seriously.  If I
took the game too seriously, I would see H&I as a slap in the face, but that
is not at all how it is intended!  The hiver were designed to be mysterious
and untrustworthy, and yet they are the very ones humanity must trust in to
help it back to the stars.  I find this incredible, and very realistic.  I
don\'t think the Hiver section is intended to be chocked full of jokes, but
the distruse of the person writing the comments is humourous at times, but
just think about the comments he makes.  They Make a lot of sense!!!  The
Ithklur section is a funny section.  I think the ithklur are there to
provide a bit of humor if it is needed.  Not all Ithklur are going to be
exactly as detailed in the book, but I find nothing in the book impossible
or even improbable.  I think Dave did an excellent job on this work, and
just because some people take the game too seriously, they are offended by
the humor that is there.  Sorry, but this is a childish reaction.

Please don\'t misunderstand, I\'m not intending to imply anything about the
issue of cannon.  I just am referring to H&I as a part of the TNE library.
I have very little MT material and even less CT material (not choice, just
devine intervention) so I con\'t really comment on the "cannon" issue.

> Honestly I\'ve never considered the Marines (bunch of guy\'s in 
battledress) a surgical strike team.  No offence to any Marine\'s out 
there.  The Marines are an elite beachhead assault force who\'s primary 
focus in traveller is ship board duties including boarding actions and 
primary DZ securing.  Along with this you could potentially throw in 
pacification campaigns.  Not wanting to start the flame war again but the 
Marine\'s are the Imperium\'s "Big Stick" of ground combat.

I feel that a surgical strike team is probably best exemplified by your 
second example.  Commando\'s.  These are guy\'s who get in, get out and no 
one know\'s they\'ve been there untill the powerplant or whatever explodes. 
 In TNE these guys are known as Special Forces, the Surgical Strike team 
would be point laser designators infiltrated on a planet months before 
the strike occured, these would be the guy\'s in charage of insuring that 
"Mortimer Crane, Supreme Dictator of Gault and Generalisimo for life" has 
an unfortunate accident on his way to the prom.  I think the main point 
of a surgical strike team is if they can get in and get out without 
firing a shot they\'ve done their job correctly, if they get into a fire 
fight they\'ve screwed it up royally.

The doctor has just eaten a corn dog and things that the Hiver\'s were 
pretty inventive for putting cheese inside the dog.

"Did you enjoy it?"
"Yes, I did, thank you."
"How surprising.  Most humans profess to find them disgusting."
"What\'s in them?"
"Nothing toxic, I assure you.  It is simply a variety of parastic 
segmented worm, much like your terran leeches, batter-dipped and fried."
"Ungh."

Well the conversation goes on from there to describe the life cycle of 
the worm etc.  Its on pages 77-78 for those of you who are interested.

Precisely. This explains how Virus could exist and could quickly
destroy advanced societies. However, there would be some systems
that Virus could only infect by physically altering them, no
matter how well it understood them. For example, military hand
computers would be designed to resist electronic intrusion.
Although most may still be vulnerable (Virus is very smart), one
or two manufacturers may have "gotten it right". If I\'m using
one of these computers (and I know it hasn\'t been altered :-),
it should be Virus-free. Of course, it is *possible* that nobody
"got it right" and it will be vulnerable to the next strain to
come along, but that\'s another story. :-)

I\'m not claiming that Virus-safe equipment would be common,
especially not at high tech levels, only that some should exist.
Some of the pro-Virus remarks imply that Virus can literally
infect *anything* (I\'m not talking about rewiring it, which would
require physical contact). This is the type of thing that really
bothers the anti-Virus crowd (as well it should).

The other thing that certainly bothered many old-timers was the
throwing away of the stable campaign background. Of course, that
was a done deal even before Virus (and when I stopped buying new
Traveller stuff, BTW).

My concern here was the fact that the incidents mentioned, especially the Gulf 
War friendly fire problems, were accidents.  The statement about the regency 
marines was a statement of government and military intent to do as much damage 
as possible to the target *and everything around it.*  Even when we targeted 
civilian infrastructure targets, great efforts were taken to avoid collateral 
damage to the surrounding non-targeted area.  Accidents are terrible things, 
but unfortunately they happen.  However, if the government were to make a 
policy of wanton destruction like that suggested in the Regency guide, that is 
a wholly different story.

As for excessive violence, that is usually in the eye of the beholder.  What 
seems excessive today was pretty limited in light of what could have been done 
at the time.  The US used the effort it felt was needed to accomplish the goal, 
and the goal was accomplished.   Anything beyond that is merely a matter of 
interpretation and Monday-morning quarterbacking.

In any event, I\'m still not trying to flame, only clarify and defend.  To say 
there have never been excesses would be a pthetic lie.  To say the excesses are 
part of everyday US military policy and methodology is equally untrue.

That being said, we return your TML to the regularly-scheduled Rocks and Virus 
Show.

The Solomani aliens book by GDW had very little about Terra at the time of the 
Third Imperium.  The Solomani & Aslan book by DGP had some more, but one of the 
best sources of Terra info wound up being the Invasion:Earth board game by 
GDW.  This game was a simulation of the invasion of Terra at the end of the 
Solomani Rim War in 990.  In addition, I believe there was a DGP adventure 
(from the Megatraveller Journal?) set on Terra.

One of these books specifically mentioned the New York was still around, 
preserved under a dome.  Apparently, Washington DC also survived, as the 
Smithsonian was mentioned in one of the two Solomani courcebooks in passing.  
The ruins of ancient Egypt were also still around; the adventure was actually 
set in that area, IIRC.  The GDW Solomani sourcebook had an adventure which 
gave some info about Terran history, regarding the restoration of an Indonesian 
(?) royal family that was exiled after some sort of global vote around the time 
of the 1st Interstellar war.

>From Invasion Earth we get some overall details.  There were three major 
starports;one each in Australia, North America and North Africa.  The one in 
North Amreica, Starport Phoenix (located near present-day Phoenix, Arizona) was 
renamed Paolo by the Imperium during the occupation, as it had too many 
connotations with the Solomani Phoenix Project (an intended anti-Imperial 
guerilla campaign).  The starport in Africa was called AECO Downport.  I recall 
reading somewhere that AECO stood for Africa-European Cooperative Organization, 
which would imply some sort of political or mercantile union between Europe and 
Africa.   

This game also gave us some indication about the big cities; really these were 
big megacities.  Not surprisingly, western Europe, the East and West coast of 
North America and Japan were all shown as vast city complexes extending for 
several hundred miles.  In addition, there were large blobs of megacity 
scattered in central China, Australia and Central America (Mexico City, I 
imagine).  I seem to recall that Africa was relatively clear of city blobs in 
the middle, but there were some in North Africa and in southern Africa.

In addition, there were some global changes.  The Mediterranen was larger, and 
the coasts of Northern Europe and the Americas were slightly changed; it looked 
as though the average sea level had increased.  This might imply some global 
warming and melting of icecaps, but I don\'t recall any specific statement.

I think the Terran of the 57th century would know far more about us today than 
we know about ancient Mesopotamia.  Unless there is some total breakdown of all 
Terran civilization (not just a drop back to TL9 in the Long Night) many 
records of nearly all facets of life will still be around centuries from now.  
Even if such a collapse were to happen, the sheer bulk of these records makes 
it much more likely to have a significant portion to survive.  Of course, this 
will still be the purview of scholars rather than the "average joe," but even 
the average guy will learn something in school.

Are you sure it\'s Virus safe?  Maybe Virus is just letting you think 
it\'s Virus free.  There would be reletively safe systems, perhaps Virus 
couldn\'t control the system properly but it could probably lay an "egg" 
in there.  This would mean that the system though uncontrolled by Virus 
is still infected.  For example fiberoptic computers would be darn hard 
for a Virus to control, not impossible because there has to be chips 
somewhere in the system, even if its not actually in the computer itself. 
 In theory due to the high degree of automation on Imperial Starships, a 
Virus could hide in the communications gear and run the show from there. 
 Living in the main computers main CPU is just asking for trouble, it\'s 
too obvious.

I agree, I\'ve always had a problem with the chips being able to rewrite 
themselves.  But hey that\'s what imagination is for.  I like to think of 
Virus as something of a chess game against Kasperov, everytime you make a 
move to get rid of it, it\'s making a move to block you, while it may not 
know what you\'re thinking it can sure as hell figure out your stragie 
pretty quick.  As for Virus safe systems, I beleive that the Regency is 
working on these, and as yet they haven\'t built one.

To paraphrase Jeff Goldblum from Jurasic Park.

"You were so busy trying to figure out how to do it that no one bother to 
stop and think whether they should be doing it at all."

It\'s the classic big stick theory.  I was watching a program on the 
atomic bomb a while ago and they were intervewing one of the guys 
involved in the Manhattan Project and the research that followed.  He 
said to him and his partners no one bothered to stop and think what they 
were doing, it was just a bunch of "boy\'s with toys" building a bigger 
and better stick not even thinking that the big stick they were working 
on could vaporize 2 million lives in a heart beat.

I see Virus as the same thing, they were so busy building a bigger stick 
that no one (okay there were a few in Survival Margin) bothered to sit 
down and say, "Whoah just a minute Frank!  Do you have any idea as to 
what this thing is capable of?  Maybe we should just think about what 
we\'re doing."

Its too bad the Terminator didn\'t show up at these guy\'s door steps and 
tell them what their project was going to do to the universe.  


What I don\'t understand is those guys who had second thoughts, why didn\'t 
some of them stay behind and try to destroy the project?

I think that this is many long time Traveller player\'s biggest problem 
with Virus.  Subconcious all of them had invested many hours building a 
stable campaign with interesting sub-plots etc.  Imagine their shock when 
they picked up, whatever, and found out that it was all destroyed.  
Suddenly all that work ment nothing.  They\'d have to start all over 
again.  It must have been horrible, I was just a player at the time.

gravity is required.  The ship has no artificial gravity, which is seen
by the designers as a waste of power.  Simulated gravity is obtained in
the outer wheel by rotating the ship; rotation is stopped in combat
situations.  
    Crew accomodations consist of 4 large staterooms for the senior
officers, 26 small staterooms for the junior officiers, and 87 bunks for
the crew.  Two large staterooms and 5 bunks are provided for flag
officers and their staff.  All crew members and passengers have
appropriate G-Tanks.  A sickbay is provided for the medic.
    The drive systems consist of three 500 MW fusion power plants with
sufficient output to operate all onboard systems.  In addition, the
60,000 ton thrust fusion drive provides 1200 MW of power.  If the ship
is maneuvering, one or two of the power plants can be put into warm idle
to reduce fuel consumption.  The fuel tanks provide for two consecutive
Jump-1\'s, 1 local year (0.9 std. years) of power, and 8 local days (27
std. hours each) of maneuvering at maximum acceleration of 3 local G\'s
(1.5 standard G\'s).  Contragravity lifters provide 20,000 tons of thrust
for near-orbit maneuvering where the fusion exhasut would be considered
dangerous.
    The electronics suite contains the Military communications/sensor
suite from the Standard Ship Design System.  Standard automation
(semi-automated systems with limited system interconnection) is built in
for combat robustness without overly large crew requirements.  
    The weapons array consists of three 500 MJ, ROF 100 laser bays
supplemented by twelve 67 MJ, ROF 100 laser turrets.  The missile
batteries are composed of three 8-tube missile bays, arranged in eight
batteries of three tubes (each tube has 12 reloads) to properly match
the capabilites of the Master Fire Directors.  The missile batteries are
provided with a magazine which can replenish all of the lauchers once
(312 missiles).  Six sandcaster turrets are also installed for defense.
    Three 30-ton displacement ship\'s boats are carried in minimal
hangers.  The engineering section also contains a workshop.  
    The price listed above includes the 10% discount for
semi-standarized constuction using the SSDS.

The effect of tech level on warship performance under the new rules has
just been hammered home like never before.  I\'m confident that a
five-boat squadron of my TL 12 Hunter-class gunboats (posted several
days ago) could handle this beast (with less than 1/3 the displacement
and cost).

I don\'t remember who made the argument that one-man fighters had been
done to death by Star Wars and huge ships by Star Trek, so he wanted to
see something new for Traveller.  I think the relative performance of
the Steadfast and the Hunter supports the "PT-Boat" theory of naval
warfare, at least when the agressor has a TL edge.  I\'ll have to design
a jump-capable frigate along the lines of the Hunter to see how this
argument holds up.

If anyone is interested, I\'ll gladly mail or post the design worksheet
for any or all of my ships (so far: TL 12 Hunter 200Td Gunboat <QSDS>,
TL 10 Steadfast 3000Td Armored Cruiser <SSDS> ).

	Remember, however, that the Imperial Marines will be the only 
Imperial ground forces available in a large majority of cases.  Due to the 
amount of spcae and length of travel time, to expect to be able to wait for a 
\'specialized surgical strike team\' to arrive is unrealistic.
	Because the Impy Marines are the only available forces, they *have* 
to be trained and used in a variety of military methods, including starship 
boarding, surgical strikes, facilities guarding, etc.

You were right about GDW\'s intent for the 4518th; they were supposed to be a 
mobile fire brigade for the sector duke.  As for what makes up an elite strike 
force, I\'d say all of the above.  It really depends on your goal.  You want to 
sneak in a small team to destroy an Ine Givar - held Deep Meson Site without 
altering the locals to the danger and without altering the Ine Givar inside?  
Send in the commandos (Navarone in the Imperium!).  You have a situation where 
all the foreigh nationals have been seized on an independent world, and you 
want to secure those hostages before the fleet begins full-sclae combat 
opertaiosn against the bad guys?  Send in the Marine jump troops.  Or you\'ve 
got a situation where a local warlord is preparing a major ground attack a
gainst a neighboring country on a balkanized planet, and while you want to stop 
the war you don\'t want to use your fleet and get called a bully?  Send in the 
4518th to smash the gathering forces and leave.

The Imperium (and the Regency thereafter) would have access to all of these 
options.  Each would be a separate unit, with its own traditions, organization 
and training.  In the organization scheme for the Imperial Marines in my 
campaign, each Marine Assault Force (reinforced battalion) would have a Drop 
Company.  The Marine Assault Force would serve as an elite MEch Infantry force 
as well, as the troops were equipped with Grav APCs and AFVs.  At the Brigade 
level, I had a commando company attached, serving as a combination of Force 
Recon/SEAL/Green Berets for the Marines.  These would be the guys who get the 
commando jobs.

This is an overall dilemma that would be even more marked in the Traveller 
universe.  Figure you have a company of 200 men.  To equip each with a 100,000 
CR battle dress and a 200,000 cr Fusion Rifle would cost 60 MCr, and that does 
not include any other equipment or spares.  When you go up against and opponent 
with battle dress and fusion weapons of its own, there is no question that this 
is 60MCr well spent.  However, what about sending the Marines in to pacify a 
Vargr pirate base or a low-tech warlord or a secret rebel position?  In those 
cases, many of the enemies would be armed with a variety of small arms (and few 
energy weapons) and maybe combat armor for some of the luckier soldiers.  A 
Marine force equipped with 20,000 Cr Combat Armor and 1,000 Cr Gauss Rifles 
with RAM GLs would be more than enough firepower.  Maybe each marine has both 
sets (battle dress and combat armor) assigned to him for maximum flexibility.

Again in my campaign, most of the marines (except for commando units and drop 
troops) were equipped at the combat armor/gauss rifle level.  Marines that were 
assigned to starships (not just carried by starships) were the ones who got the 
battle dress and fusion weapons issued to them.  The Marine Assault Force would 
be in Battle Dress, but the three divisions of marines carried in those brigade 
transports over there would be in combat armor.  

Gee, I\'m actually glad I responded to David\'s first post, as it seems to have 
started up an interesting line of thought.  Thanks.

Okay, I looked at this, and it\'s muddy.  MT materials indicate that by Dawn,
the SF had "extended control to what is now the edge of Core sector" (in
_Imperial Encyclopedia_).  DGP materials state that Vland was the initial
target of Cleon\'s Campaign, joining the Federation in -30, and that long-
range scouts had reached there as early as -495.  Trivia: Cleon would be
27 years old in -30.  The Pacification Campaigns of Artemsus on the map
show a clear, fighting-free route between Sylea and Vland, but I\'m not 
sure how the area jump routes work.

Messing this up further, _Imperial Encyclopedia_ also says on page 8, that
Cleon "succeeded in forming a government that controlled, with a velvet-
gloved fist, nearly 100 subsectors".  That\'s substantially more than Core
sector.  Furthermore, there\'s some signs that even in a game context, some
of the early Imperial history is not clear to the citizens of 1100; for 
instance, the situation with Cleon the Weak and Artemsus Lentuli, the early
history of some megacorporations like Tukera Lines, and so forth.

The "velvet-gloved fist" comment I found particularly interesting....

Now that you mention this, I remember it.  Does it specifically state that
the worm is a corndog, or is that just implied?  I seem to remember that H&I
said that Hiver were herbivores.  I don\'t know how much certainty of trust
can be placed in the novels.  I enjoyed the novels as books, but I found
some things that I didn\'t think fit with the TNE universe.

Not really.  *Real* libertarians don\'t support *any* government-imposed 
monetary \'standard\'.  You want to trade in gold?  Fine.  Some 
enterprising company want to make standardized gold coins?  Coolness.  
Major banks like to issue currency based on their assets?  More power to 
them.  Just keep the damgubment *out* of it!

Interestingly, in the early years of the U.S., most currency in
circulation was issued by private and state banks, not the federal
government.  Folks doing inter-regional business would have large books
containing information on how to validate an alleged note from some
distant bank -- and, of course, forgery was rampant.  It wasn\'t until
after the Civil War that the federal government restricted money
production to itself.  At first this was not pegged to any metal, leading
to the \'greenback inflation\' of the 1870s.  The federal notes were called
\'greenbacks\' as the punchline to a joke -- "What are they backed with? 
Green ink!"  Finally, the feds went to a gold standard, and then a
bimetallic standard of gold and silver, in a fixed value ratio, and with
silver coinage limited in extent.  When massive silver lodes were
discovered out West, there was pressure from Western interests to allow 
free coinage of silver, and to increase its value relative to gold...this 
would have led to a freer money supply, helping out farmers during a bad 
midwestern depression in the 1880s and 90s.  Hence William Jennings 
Bryan\'s immortal "Cross of Gold" speech.

Ever wondered why those cents-off coupons are always marked with a 
monetary exchange value (in the USA)?  Because they\'re dangerously close 
to currency -- no intrinsic value, but exchangeable for things that *are* 
valuable.  They\'d be illegal -- competing currency -- if they weren\'t 
pegged to the value of the US dollar.

The relevance of all this to Traveller economics is left as an exercise 
for the student. :)

Sounds good to me. :)  I hope it doesn\'t become a flame war, though.

It\'s hard to say what size of a maintainable empire can be sustaind for 
a good length of time.  The only real examples we have are the Roman 
Empire and the empire largely created by Genghis Kahn. At least, those 
two seem most relevant to the discussion, IMO.

In both cases, transportation was a great factor.  And, again in both 
cases, great pains were taken to ensure as speedy and reliable of 
transportation (and, therefore, communication) as possible.  

Can someone provide figures for the time lag from the seat of these 
empires to the furthest reaches, at their greatest?  

Any other relevant examples spring to mind?

Anyway, that should get us started on the discussion. :)

Untrue...  Whether 1 bases their currency on the gold standard or 
not, inflation and deficit spending are still bugaboos...most 
countries went off the gold standard when it became obvious that it 
was restricting the supply of currency to the point where it was 
causing deflation...which it did a lot of in the Depression...  Any 
economist with any brains will tell you that deflation can be as 
ruinous as inflation...  It\'s just that we have more experience with 
inflation in recent times...

The Roman Empire in part was wrecked by a ruinous inflation in later 
centuries...they never left a standard based on precious metals...

As for deficit spending, governments have been doing that for 
ages...it didn\'t just magically start happening in the 30\'s when 
everybody went off the gold standard...  Remember Louis XVI?  
He lost his head because he spent the French treasury into massive 
debt financing the American Revolution.  Britain nearly went bankrupt 
in 1910\'s because they\'d spent a good chunk of money on social 
programs, and didn\'t have a whole lot left to finance that little thing
called World War I...

Hell, there\'s not even a real good correlation between inflation and
deficit spending...the US economy is a good example of that...  The 
deficit amounts to about 10-15% of GNP, but inflation hovers at about 
5%...

Regardless of what a currency is based on, whether it be faith, gold, 
salt, or ivory (all of which have been used at 1 time or another by 
somebody on Earth), the people still have to believe its worth 
something...  If somebody had found gold nuggets by the ton on say for 
example Australia, economies would have been wrecked wholesale in the 
18th century...

Actually, an interstellar empire is even less likely to base its 
currency on a precious metal of any kind, when you consider there\'s a 
great chance that the system 2 parsecs over might have enough of your 
**precious** metal to the point where they use it in thin foil sheets 
to wrap candy bars...

Sorry to spout, but this is just not an economically sound 
argument...

Maybe my mind has shut down for the night already, but: Why would this be 
a problem so significant as to require a currency that is not free 
floating?

Hmmm...if I recall correctly, the Imperial ruling family has a bit of 
stock in a number of megacorps.  Then, there\'s taxation.  I don\'t see the 
Imperium laying waste to the frontiers in order to satisfy wants and 
needs at the core.  The stated goal has always been the facilitation of 
trade between member worlds.  If you want a monetary reason for that, I\'d 
say the increased tax base that comes with increased trade would work.

This is a good point.  But then, I never bought the idea of member worlds 
having their own currency anyway.  I figured, one Imperium, one currency.

No kidding!  I did the same thing (though, sadly, we don\'t have Der

Mine? Not especially, although since the PCs were the crew (and
hanger\'s-on) of a free trader, merchantile operations were always the
backdrop against which the adventures took place. My campaign did not
last long, but a lot of stuff from it ended up as part of the Imperium
in one form or another.

> My other question is one that I\'ve wondered about for quite some time.
> Who wrote the Traveller News Service section?

Numerous people. Marc, Frank, myself, and other GDW staffers wrote the
lion\'s share of them. We got a lot of TNS stuff in the mail, and we
ran some of them (some intact, some edited). I can\'t say about the
rest of the staff, but in my case, ideas would occur at odd moments,
and I would jot them down. When it was time to put an issue to bed,
I\'d take the "required news" from the pre-written FFS stuff, and fill
in with other stuff. I would ask for news items from the office in
general, and if there weren\'t enough to fill up a page, I\'d write some
at the last minute.

>  How far in advance were TNS-announced events planned?

The FFW stuff was worked out a year or two in advance. Other itemslaid
around for a few weeks, months, or days. Some of them I wrote as the
issue was going to press.

>  And, did the folks at GDW play the events announced out before

Marc and Frank had a time-table for the FFW, but it wasn\'t the result
of any game-play.

Darryl Adams

More than you know. Imperial Rome is a special interest of mine (some
would say a fixation), and both Marc and Frank were widely-read in
history. We looked at the Persian and Chinese empires also, but Rome
of the Caesars was a major inspiration for how the Imperium worked.
> 2) Asimov\'s Impirium.

Asimov admitted that the Foundation trilogy was partially inspired by
Gibbon\'s _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_. We had all read the
trilogy, of course, and it formed part of the SF literary background
we drew Traveller\'s Imperium from.

> 3) Niven & Pournelle First and Second Imperium.

We were all Niven fans, and Known Space was part of the same
background mentioned above. Frank likes Pournelle slightly less than
Marc and I do, but he was also part of the background.

Some of those changes were intentional, some of them were simply a
rush job tracing the map. : )

There were a couple of big inland seas that we added to reflect
climate control Terra-forming: I don\'t have the map handy, but there
was a large sea in Siberia added to provide a heat reservoir to warm
the place up. I can\'t remember anything else. People wrote us letters
asking if there had been global warming, or nuclear accidents, or
meteor strikes...

As far as I\'m concerned, you shouldn\'t sweat it about being unable to 
pay.  Look at all the stuff that is presented here for free!  The sad 
thing is, although the digests are archived, the material is generally 
lost to the casual web denizen.  I\'d like to see a central location where 
the best material produced by the Traveller mailing list participants 
would be available for all to see.

Not really all that amazing.  A lot of people don\'t have Survival 
Margin...

I own it, as well as Hivers and Ithklur...and have read them, so I 
feel that I do know what I\'m talking about.

OK, granted, the "Corndogs" idea is an interesting study in culture

Some people do, but not because they take it seriously.  They bought 
H&I for the reasons I did.  To get a better development of the races 
to use in a future RPG session...not for humor, and certainly not to 
trash a great deal of what had been written before about the 
Hivers...

> is not at all how it is intended!  The hiver were designed to be mysterious

This is generally not the point of ANY alien race in a WELL-DEVELOPED 
story or RPG session.  The Hivers should have very good motivations 
for why they do, what they do...it shouldn\'t be dark and mysterious 
to a referee.  It will often be different than what a human would do 
in the same circumstances, but if its a mystery to referee, its just 
plain not a well developed alien...its a cardboard cutout caricature 
of an alien...this is my biggest beef with H&I...it contradicted 
previous references, and it didn\'t really develop them all that well 
in the direction it took it (other than wrapping it in mystery)... 

Actually, looking back at this aspect of it, it gives me the feel of 
a lot of the old cold war propaganda films made in the US about the 
Communists.  Wrapping them in an aura of mysterious evil, that made 
them less than human, and therefore more acceptable as an enemy.  
There should be so much more than that to an alien, and in the older 
alien modules (including the original GDW ones) there was.  There 
wasn\'t much of that in H&I though.

And dismissing somebody else\'s considered opinion of a book as

Great...then you have NO reason to bash those of us who were here 
before and do have a lot of old stuff, for disliking H&I...

There are a lot of things I like about TNE...H&I is NOT 1 of them...

Yes.

The opperation defines what you are going to use.  If the Imperial Marines
are raiding a pirate base, then it\'s BD and fusion time.  If a small team
needs to infiltrate a secured perimeter, Combat Enviroment Suits and Gauss
weapons.

Your third option describes a classic air-mobile "Mike Force" attack.  A
recon unit on the ground (probably only 3 or 4 men) reports contact and the
Mike Force choppers in to pin the enemy down while more assets are gathered.
This might describe the future of grav warfare: a series of meeting engagements.

>Are there other options?

The Imperial Marines probably have specially trained boarding parties,
trained especially for taking enemy ships away from their rightful owners.

Hehehehehe.. I knew the Air Farce was lying about the smart bombs.  If you
are the United States, no.  The US Military has a tradition of overwhelming
force applied with a certain childish glee.  (Before anyone flames, please
remember, I was in the US Army, and saw it for myself.)

The Imperium will probably be in the same circumstance in regard to the Navy
and Marines.  Training can really be defined by how ofton you get to fire
your weapons, and I think the Imperium will make sure that the Emperor\'s own
troops are the best.

The same sort of stuff that\'ll be going into JTAS.  Wouldn\'t it be

Get this all approved by MM and IG before you start.  I doubt they\'ll
have a problem if you aren\'t charging/paying, honor MM\'s and IG\'s
copywrites, AND get approval in advance.

I love it!  One of my early suggestions to MM about T4 was to support

The real question is, would this matter?  Anyone on a particular planets
stock/whatever market would hear news at ostensibly the same time----that
is, minimum jump time from the news source.  In essence, everyone will
hear the tree fall at the same time.  It doesn\'t matter that the
information happened six months ago, those on the same planet will learn
this information at the same time and act on it.

I see, then, trading within the Imperium not as specific and absolute
blocks, but more like a bunch of pebbles tossed in a pond (to wax
philosophical for a moment).  Trading based on this system would be very
complex----it is concievable (and probable) that the market crashes on
the spinward side of the Imperium and booms on the trailward side, etc.

I also see a ton of possiblities for adventures for trading characters.
And a stronger role for more organized corsiars.  Two ideas based on this
line of reasoning: Corsairs delay a(n) x-boat and then make a killing on
another market with the information only they have.  Or, enterprising
characters set up an arbitage system, and try to make a killing...

Granted this doesn\'t have much to do with the currency discussion...

Well, I just read _Ringworld_ by Larry Niven (liked it so much I added it
to my tagline), as I\'m sure most of you have.  Niven does portray much
about how a civilization is decimated by Bacteria (so it isn\'t Virus, sue
me----no don\'t, I can\'t afford it).  I would imagine Virus is along the
same lines...as the bacteria ate away at the superconductors necessary to
sustain life on the Ringworld, the populace squandered valuable time doing
nothing, like using their dwindling power supply for freezing food and
floating cities, and then everything went tits-up when the power ran out.

It is POSSIBLE (don\'t throw any objects at your computer, I\'m just
theorizing) that this is what happened to the Third Imperium because they
did not have the guts (for lack of a better word) to regress to a stable
TL of (what 7?) that could have weathered the Virus by reverse-obsoleting
it (i.e. making their systems, and even daily life, incapable of
supporting Virus by means of stupidifying it).

Remember that a good portion of the smart weaponry used in the Gulf
Conflict didn\'t do quite as well as it could have (because it missed,
etc.), which would factor into the price.  (But they didn\'t show the ones
that missed on CNN)

Of course, one problem with this is that the doctor was Aubaini, 
which is a waterworld, and the local diet would resemble  
Japanese cuisine far more than American. And whatever meat 
(if any) is in the dogs, it likely isn\'t any medium- to large-land-animal, 
not enough land-area to support them. 
 
Aubaini would be the *last* people in the Coalition to 
get disgusted at the idea of eating sea-slug-thingies.

Fine, Fine, but the real question is (running for cover): What\'s the

...it was *very* unlikely huge quantities of gold nuggets would have
been found anywhere by the 18th century, and everybody *knew* it.
Economies were predicated on gold\'s relative rarity, based on
thousands of years of experience.  Gold is still valued more for it\'s
rarity than it\'s commercial use, even if economies don\'t peg their
currency on it anymore.

I can\'t quite buy this either.  Elemental distribution isn\'t likely to
vary *that* much from system to system.  Sure system X, may contain
larger quantities of **precious** than system Y, but California also
contained larger quantities of a **precious** than New York or
England, and in fact so did Australia.  New York and England were
still the centers of power.

Pegging the credit on gold, probably isn\'t the most economically sound
system.  However gold, and many other elements, will continue to be
rare.  Rare enough to be used as money, if a government so chooses.

IMHO,

The British Empire, of course. The loss of the North American colonies is,
in Britain, in *part* explained by the huge communications delay (four
weeks at best, I believe, but that\'s only from vague memories of "AO" level
History, courtesy of Millfield School, Street, Sommerset).

Better yet is the battle of New Orleans, fought by the Britsih Empire
*after* the peace was agreed upon, simply because word hadn\'t arrived yet.

My own beef with the Corn Dogs comes from the sheer number of 20th century
referrences found in later Traveler material. Would a civilization
X-hundred years from now *really* still be obsessed by late 20th-century
junk (read "pop") culture? It struck me as being damn culturally
self-centered. For me, the whole mystique of the Imperium broke down on
such pieces of pop-centricism. Especially the Monty Python referrences. And
I\'m a Monty Python FAN!

How much popular culture from even 150 years ago is still around on this
island Earth?

Just my particular niggling opinion.

Ah, but would they?  You\'re assuming a level playing field, and with
money on the table nobody plays all that fair.  If I can get news/info
about outside conditions a few days, even hours, before more
competition then I\'ll have an advantage.  On X-boat routes that might
not be possible, but not every planet is on those routes, and the
X-boats weren\'t there throughout the entire 3rd Imperium.

I see it as waves of information rolling back and forth across the
Imperium.  I also think the crash of a company or major system on one
end of the Imperium might propogate across the whole Imperium, perhaps
petering out as the precieved importance of the company or system
declined.

I know this is way off topic, but I think this is one(probably second) of my
all time favorite lines from a movie.  BTW, I think it applies incredibly
well to Virus.

As a side note, those of you who have kids will appreciate my favorite line:

Romans built their roads, and the Mongols had, what amounted to, a
pony express network.

Two months?  <g> Ok, I\'m guessing, but once the road system was in
place Roman couriers on horseback or chariot could cover at least 50
miles a day, and 50*60=3000 miles!  The Mongols really did have a pony
express system setup, and rapid movement was one of their hallmarks.

>Any other relevant examples spring to mind?

Actually, I think the British Empire is relevant.  During the 18th
century the British had possisions all over the world.

These Empires all gave a good deal of control to local governors
rather than trying to govern from the center.

I seem to recall some SF book (an E. E. Smith?) in which a fledgling
empire, or one that had just survived/avoided a major upheaval, went
on the Energy Standard - ie. a credit would be worth x amount of
energy, and rationally all goods would be valued in terms of the
energy spent to create them.  Of course, in reality, goods and
services would be priced according to the market, as affected by
protectionist policies, taxes, scarcity (real or artificial), etc.
However, the credit would still be pegged to the rarity of energy.  I
don\'t think this is at risk from advances in fusion technology, and
anyway it could just depend on the cheapest way of making energy (in
the Imperium).  Of course, I think widespread anti-matter powerplants
may have caused problems.

Any one with some idea of economics (reflected sounds of underground
little people) care to comment on the viability of this?

    ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/trav/qsd.WK4

The WK1 is for all of you with spreadsheets that only support
the ancient 1-2-3 format. Those who support the latest 1-2-3
format can get the proper sheet by looking at the WK4 file.
  I\'d like someone else to proof it. Seems OK to me.

Notes:
  I don\'t do incremental crew. The logic is that the ship should
be designed for a normal crew. During normal operations you may
put less on, but it is designed for full capacity.
  I only support the basic hulls. The WK4 has the huge-list-of-hulls
table in it but it isn\'t linked in (yet).
  The trade analysis stats convert the currency to TL15 imperial
"norm".

Additional:
  I\'ve encoded this spreadsheet as a generic C++ class. Once I\'m
sure that works I\'ll make it public to anyone who wants to write
a UI around it for an operating system of their choice...

What, you eat them?  Ahh, it\'s all clear now.  I thought from the
original description of what was in them that they were some
kind of weapon designed using that chapter of FF&S that I

Remembering that that was a different war.

I\'ve seen the point made that the telegraph is what KILLED the Empire.

Antimatter p-plants consume antimatter which presumably has to be
manufactured in a fusion plant. Antimatter is simply a way to pack more
energy into fuel for vehicles et c.

There\'s a great line from the journalism industry. I forget who said it,
and this is a paraphrase:

"Many times, people confuse what they HAVE a right to print with what IS
right to print."

Now substiture "electronically engineer" for "print," and *voila*! :-)

Weird. In the US a "Dagwood" is a sandwich made up of many layers of
all sorts of different meats, cheese, whatever. The name is from the
comic strip "Blondie" where the husband (Dagwood Bumstead) is always
building these *huge* sandwiches. To the best of my knowledge he\'s been
doing this since the strip started in the 30s!

It occurs to me that if fighters are *not* common (as in Millieu 0)
there\'d be a tendency to build *big* heavily armed and armored ships,
even though they\'d be slow. This\'d be the old "battleship" approach.
You may not be fast, but when you get there, there are only two kinds
of enemy ships. Ones that can get out before you pound them to rubble,
and the ones you are about to pound to rubble.

A few fighters could ruin your whole day. They\'d have to be able to sit
there quietly, concealed by something (I have a few ideas :-), and then
do a quick run in, fire, and get the hell out of there.

One thing that occurs to me is that most folks seem to be designing
ships to run all the weapons at once. Given that power *distribution*
isn\'t terribly expensive, and that most weapons can be operated at
lower power, the likely designs would be for ships that can fire the
main weapons at full power only if they aren\'t using much of the
secondary armament.

Hell, depending on the energy requirements, I could even see reasons
for designing ships that can\'t use full *drive* power and fire the main
guns at the same time.

Remember, you are going to have conflicting requirements, and limited
funds. So you make the best compromise you can.

If you design a ship that can do everything at once, and I design one
that costs the same, but can put out more firepower by not manuevering,
or by not using the secondary weapons at the same time, I can pound on
you at ranges where you can\'t get close. If you *do* get close, then I
can run like hell, or pound you with secondary weapons. But I\'ll have
some words to say to the captains of the ships that were supposed to be
making you keep your distance!

In a world where these sorts of choices get made, suddenly things like
fighters *do* have a place. Fighters and missiles can firce me to waste
power defending myself instead of attacking you.

Nope. The "rule of thumb" is that *3* km/s give you the energy of an
equivalent amount of TNT.

Reading this, I just flashed on a bunch of old "Mission: Impossible"
episodes. 

That would be an interesting sort of campaign to run. Being an IMF for
the Imperium. On lower tech worlds it\'s *easier*, but not necessarily
as easy as the players might think. I don\'t care if you *do* have
1990\'s technology, going up against (say) the Gestapo requires being
*very* careful.

It\'s actually *very* close to what\'s taught here, when it\'s covered in

I was hoping not to have to remind people of that. :-) But it was still the
same Empire. In many ways, it was a stronger Empire. And the time lag still
affected the war of 1812.

Well, this is a cute line but the cost and carnage of the First World War
did far more to destroy the Empire in reality and (perhaps more
importantly) in people\'s eyes...

Still, to get this thread back on track, I think the Roman administrative
system is closer to the Imperium than the British Empire is. The system of
Provinces and Governors and their relative power to the "throne,"
unfortunately, allowed the Rebellion to happen in the first place. (Or at
least allowed GDW to use that to rationalize the Rebellion...)

Maybe publish material to support new product releases from IG.
For example, when Starships comes out, publish a bunch
of starship designs using the new system. When Aliens comes
out, publish some adventures with aliens to stimulate interest
in buying IG\'s products. Be proactive towards supporting IG.

Get someone with artistic ability to help out. A few good graphics

Actually, in defense of "Cynthia" (Steve, right?) (though I disagree wth
him), I must point out that part of the "problem" for Rome _was_ the
precious metal standard: by the later empire the coinage was so debased
(adulterated with less valuable metals in order to be able to mint more
currency with the same amount of metal) that it caused widespread
economic difficulties.

Other folks have claimed that elemental abundances shouldn\'t vary much
between stellar systems, and thus a Gold/Iridium/Unobtainium standard
would be workable.  But, while the abundances wouldn\'t vary much, the
_exploitation_ and hence _available supply_ would.  There used to be
places on Earth where you could pick up copper nuggets off the ground...
but not after the Bronze Age got going.  Gold deposits were few and
far between in the Old World after centuries of mining... and then the
New World gave a bonanza of riches to the Spanish (which wrecked their
economy in just the way people are supposing!  I don\'t think they\'ve
ever quite recovered... though problems like Franco have also intervened).

Terra, Vland, Sylea, Zhdant, all have long histories of mineral
exploration and exploitation.  The discovery of a virgin, uninhabited
planet with untapped veins of precious metal could cause a significant
blip in precious metal supplies throughout the young Imperium, or at
least through a Domain in the full-sized jumbo version of 1000+.

That may be the true sinister intent that motivates those evil, villaneous
"they", but what gives them such a perfect excuse is that pegging the
wealth of a society (which is actually the sum total of the goods
produced by its inhabitants (and their ancestors, if durable)) to an
arbitrary (and uncontrollable) supply of some rare substance with
little intrinsic value is such a silly thing to do.

I\'ve always been impressed by the currencies used in Jack Vance\'s books,
where the unit is the amount of money paid for one hour of unskilled
labour. No doubt there would be practical problems with this, but it\'s
a wonderful way to make equipment lists for one society useful for a
different one. In my campaign one credit (lower-case c) is a sociological
term for this amount of money. It varies from low-tech, low-population
society to high-tech, high-population society, of course, but that\'s what 
exchange tables are for. One Crimp (Credit, Imperial) is the imperial 
currency and is equivalent to the credit of a high-population, TL 15 world 
with a Class A starport. This accords well with many of the prices 
published in various Traveller publications, though not perfectly. In
any case the salary tables and costs of living in Traveller are badly
broken anyway.

[Incidentally, I\'ve had to skip a huge amount of messages over the last
months. Did Imperium Games ever answer those questions they solicited
a long while ago, and if the did, can anybody mail me a copy? I posted
a question about wether they intended to mend the economic system for T4
and I\'d like to know the answer.]

Yes. In fact, I once noticed that the Imperial family has 2% or more stock
in all LIC corporations detailed in any Traveller source I can find (with
the exception of one single megacorporation). Sometimes they have more, but
at least 2. I therefor decided that the lone exception was a misprint and
that in my campaign the "price" of a LIC charter is giving 2% of the company
to the Emperor. This share cannot be sold or otherwise transferred.

I don\'t know about the first part, but the thousand years of experience
included the virtual ruining of the Spanish economy by the huge amounts
of gold they brought back from the New World.

Or concealed by nothing...a fighter with minimal power systems running

Sure.  Why do you need 4 G\'s of acceleration to sit at 300000kms above a
planet and pound the snot out of it?  Assuming planetary defenses had been

Oop.  That brings up something I should have mentioned when I replied to 
Jeff\'s query before:  make the page accessible to text-only users as 
well.  There are those of us who use text-only because it is very much 
faster to download text than graphics.  I hate it when I go to a web site 
and the text-only version looks like garbage because the person 
maintaining it didn\'t bother to see what it looks like without all the 
pretty graphics.  It doesn\'t take a lot of effort to make sure it looks 
good for all users.

I\'ll admit that the Hiver are shrouded in mystery in the Players section,
but I felt that every part of the mystery that needed to be resolved was
resolved.  Sure, GDW didn\'t come right out and say that the Hiver
manipulated the collapse, but I don\'t immagine the original Droyne manual
declared the secrets of the ancients either.

I\'m sorry if you misunderstood my point, but what I intended to refer to as
childish was peoples opinions that were stated without direct knowledge of
the book.  If you have the book and have read it, I don\'t think your opinion
(whatever it is) is childish; however, to discount a plot device (Virus) or
a book (H&I) without knowing the facts is childish.

Again, I\'m not bashing anyone who knows the material.  I\'m a bit perterbed
by those who don\'t know the material and yet continue to bash TNE and its
supplements.  I regret that I didn\'t get involved with Traveller earlier so
that I could have had the opportunity to gather the CT & MT material.  If I
had the CT & MT supplements on the Hiver, I might be less inclined to like
Hiver & Ithklur.  I don\'t think that apart from the "cannon" issue there is
any problem with Hiver & Ithklur.  If the previous stuff had never been
done, Hiver & Ithklur would be a wealth of information, enough for any
referee to run a Hiver or Ithklur PC or NPC.

I\'ll buy that, as long as by "probably" you mean because 99.9% of the
technology *happens* to be vulnerable in some way or another. In other
words, future engineers continued down the path of thinking that their
puny attempts at adding security into basically unsafe systems actually
did any good. This is believable because its happening now.

But...

Suppose there is a culture that does not trust computers to make their
decisions for them. Computers that did exist would only *recommend*
actions to be taken. High-tech equipment can still exist, but it would
not be programmable, nor controllable from other than the console or
other manual controls. Sure, Virus-infected machines might be able to
physically modify the equipment (each one individually!), but they
should otherwise not be vulnerable to infection. Nor could Virus "lay
an egg" in them other than by physically modifying them.

You can certainly argue that this culture would always be lagging in
tech level, but so what? Many planets did--this could explain why a
planet in an otherwise "advanced" section of the galaxy did.

By the same token, future technology has always given us a much greater
understanding of past technology. Using TL8 technology, I could *prove*
that a piece of TL6 (or maybe even TL7) technology is safe. No amount
of knowledge would allow you to break into that system. Is this done
today? Certainly. Unfortunately, many people (especially modern weapons
designers) like to have the most advanced computers at their disposal,
so we are forced to use the less-powerful "trusted" systems as a form
of gateway to the more powerful systems, which may be vulnerable to
more subtle attacks like your "egg". However, if modern technology is
not used, the system need not be vulnerable. For example, many of the
ships in the U.S. Navy still use 1940\'s technology (vaccuum tubes!) and
make up for the lack of automation with a larger crew.

Finally, even modern technology, if well-understood, can be designed
in a "safe" way. Early microwave ovens, for example, did not have any
microchips inside. Undoubtedly, many are still being designed with
tried-and-true (read: Virus-safe) hard-wired microcontrollers. Sure,
many of them are probably being built with more advanced controllers
that *might* be vulnerable if there were some way of communicating
control information to them. But even if you claim that the latter
are all vulnerable, there are still millions of microwaves that are
not.

Do you see my point? Virus-free technology does exist. My mechanical
pencil is not vulnerable, nor is my electro-mechanical watch. Given
time, I could prove to you that my electronic watch is not either.
I\'m certain that my Sega Genesis is safe even if Virus had access
to the joystick ports (although I\'d rather not go through the proof).
Of course, I can\'t prove that my PC and UNIX workstations are safe
(I\'m quite sure they\'re not). I think that this will be the trend in
the future. The more modern computers will tend to be networked and
integrated, and vulnerable to a sufficiently advanced attack. Older
computers would be thoroughly understood using current technology,
and tend not to be vulnerable.

Note that I\'m not talking about making physical modifications. Of
course, any equipment that can be physically altered is vulnerable,
regardless of whether it uses silicon, optics, or gears to operate.
I\'ve heard claims that the Deyo transponders provided a way for
virus to do this (they had to be given a "silicon conduit" to the
main computer\'s memory). Of course, if I were paranoid about such
things (e.g., if I were a pirate or a non-Imperial), I would at
least spoof the transponder by connecting it to an isolated "main
computer". In any event, this does not help give Virus a foothold
into hand computers and other non-transponder-equipped equipment.

There is no need to make grand claims about seemingly impossible
actions that Virus can take. Plenty of technology that is vital to
us is already likely to be vulnerable this type of intrusion. For
example, phreakers have long made use of knowledge of the phone
system--Virus would simply use this knowledge to control it. It
could easily take over commerce, air-traffic control, even the
electrical grids from there. With increased computer control and
networking in the future, it is easy to envision a society that
would crumble easily before Virus.

> I agree, I\'ve always had a problem with the chips being able to
> rewrite themselves.

We have chips that do this now. Self-modifying code is a simple
example, but there are even chips that essentially *rewire*
themselves. But not all of these are vulnerable to Virus, nor
does *all* equipment use them. This will still be true in the
57th century.

> As for Virus safe systems, I beleive that the Regency is working on

This is illogical. I would buy that they have not been able to
build a Virus-safe starship computer, perhaps. But they certainly
can build safe hand computers. I\'m certain (but don\'t intend to
prove) that we have these now. I could certainly *design* one and
*prove* that it is safe if I had to.

Yes, and part of why Virus is such a powderkeg (especially since
Rob has encouraged XTML\'ers to use the TML for T4 discussions).
Actually, the campaign background destabilized during the MT days,
so much of the blame is misplaced.

	Howard Scott, the owner of a paint and floor-wax company in 
Greenwich Villagy in New York proposed such a system in the early 1930\'s 
(just after the depression hit.)  He urged that people get pain in ergs 
and joules acording to the amount of energy the machines they operated 
produced.
	This "Technocracy" was to change the structure of society, where 
the ruling class would be composed of scientists and engineers.  
	Scott became and overnight celebrity, and was given space for 
research at Columbia U.  For months in 1933, his theories were among the 
most discussed topics in America, til the cult of Technocracy faded away.

	Of course, this didn\'t stop me from using his ideas on a couple 
of planets in my Traveller campaign.

You know, I\'ve never even thought about this. I just logged into my shell
account and looked at my own page with Lynx, and it looks horrible (only
tested it with Netscape). On a hunch, I checked out my company\'s page,
which uses frames (http://www.ahpc.com). Looked even worse (no, I
didn\'t write it, but I do know who to blame). I wonder how many other
commercial-type sites totally disregard Lynx users?

Thanks, Joe, for clueing me in. I think Jeff should definitely try to support
all web users with his WebMag.

Well, nothing in my school!

Incidentally, a common reference point in CT for the way in which a
big empire operated were the empires of the 18th and 19th centuries,
ie. the European holdings in America, Africa, and Asia.  These all
operated under tremendous communicatino lags, and local governors had
tremendous latitude.  The main difference is that the progress of
technology and politics in the Imperium hasn\'t resulted in a) instant
comm or b) widespread independence.  As a result, the "independent
individual on the spot" method of management has had far more time to
develop.

Well, only at the begining.  In an anti-matter economy, anti-matter
plants could be used to run your Creato-Anti-Matter (tm) machine.

I\'m not sure what I\'m getting at with the "Energy Standard", but I
think the idea is that the credit is pegged to how effectively an
energy-dependent economy can generate the energy it needs.  Would this
work?  Perhaps a credit could be called a Joule?  "I want 10 MJ to
fight for your side, President".

a few more examples: the British Empire in the 18th and early 19th 
centuries, when it spanned the globe in the Age of Sail, but 
before telegraph cables were laid across the Atlantic and 
to India. Also, the ancient Persian Empire was quite large, 
as was the Incan Empire at it\'s height. 
 
In the Roman, Persian and British Empires, we see regional 
governors/satraps/etc. give a great deal of power locally, 
as time/distance to higher authority prohibited close management 
from "home".  The 3rd Imperium seems to have aimed at a 
similiar setup with the Sector & Subsector Dukes. 
 
I\'ll leave for further discussion how well this works...

The power of the Archdukes varied depending on what era of the Third 
Imperium they ruled in.  From reading "Survival Margin," and much of the 
MegaTraveller material that gave background on the Rebellion/Final War, I 
inferred that the pre-Strephon archdukes weren\'t truly kings in their own 
right, but served more as administrators of the Domains.  It\'s been 
theorized that Strephon\'s reemphasis of the powers of the archdukes, 
while taking some of the administrative strain off of Capital, was one of 
the factors that lead to the increasing factionalism that led to the 
Rebellion after his apparent assassination.

No offence taken :^) -- That is basically the rol eof any naval infantry or

Special Operations, I believe.  The term noiw allpied to any Elite of 
the Elite type forces that have missions that fall into clasifications 
which are outside th4 main thrusts of the \'conventioanl\' war fighting.
Commandos suits as well - basically all services/nations have them as 
even in NonConventional/ "Low-Intensity" (Unless you\'re in the middle of it)
conflicts, the services and even nations have different foci and objectives.

In the US -
Marines -- Force Recon, and Recon Sniper Teams
Navy    -- Seals
Army    -- Rangers, Special Forces, (veitnam and _non_ elite) LRRP
Air Force -- Air Commandoes (primarily IIRC mission airfield capture 
airhead establishment.

British SAS, French Forign Legion Paras, USSR Spetznatz etc etc etc

All usually true especially the last, although sometimes the job is to 
make as much ruckus as possible as a diversion.  The military, esp. US, 
has an unfortunate tendancy to forget the above and think they have super 
soliders and use them incorrectly or ineffectivley.  Check out the 
coareers of the Rangers in WWII.

For a much better discussion than I can give, esp in an RPG perspective 
check out GURPS Special OPs, even if you hate the system there is alot of 
great info and flavor there. 


The Imperial marines would tend to have their own such units although 
many smaller ships complments might need to be a bit more trained in this 
respect than we would see today.  Tho\' these guys tend to  not make great 
spit-n-polish soldiers!

Jo,

Thanks for putting that up there!  I downloaded the WK4 version.

One problem I found (and perhaps it was caused by the transfer-such 
things have been known to happen):  If you try to build a ship with no 
missiles, this produces an ERROR result in several cells, which dribbles 
it down to cargo space, hull, power plant, and all sorts of things.  
Makes it impossible to do a design without having a misile launcher.

I look forward to when this list will be linked in.


Thanks again for sharing your work,

Yup. You saved me the trouble of pointing that out.  A gold 
standard doesn\'t prevent inflation, but it does make gov\'mnt 
finagling of the money supply a *lot* more obvious.

Spain\'s economy collapsed for the same reason the Reform Coalition\'s 
economy was going to collapse: they were looting so much wealth from 
the New World, that local industries back in Spain couldn\'t compete, 
and went under.  With no local industry, when Spain lost control of 
its overseas possessions, the local economy went into a tailspin 
from which it still hasn\'t recovered--in part due to socialist  
or fascist economic policies like Franco\'s.

As did the gold strikes in the U.S... And what did discovering

as a semi-precious mineral?

BZZZZT!  I\'m afraid that you\'ve hit one of my Hot Buttons.  Sorry!

The TNE novels can hardly be considered an adequate source of Traveller 
canon.  In fact, one of the things I found most offensive about them 
besides the author\'s writing style (Addicted to the Subordinate Clause) 
were the frequent "facts" presented that were contrary to established 
canon.  Among them:

Firing \'warning shots across the bow\' with a laser.  Stop giggling!

The continuous operation of a jump drive while in J-space.  No, I don\'t 
think he ever read DGP\'s "Starship Operator\'s Manual," either.

The \'true nature\' of Hiver \'corn dogs.\'  Whoops.  Already touched on that 
one.  Sorry.

For the record:  Lacking pig-derived frankfurters, or even pigs, the 
Hivers chose an aquatic annelid species (sort of like sea cucumbers) to 
be the frankfurter substitute.  They are quite palatable, even to humans 
provided that they don\'t know what they really are.  One possible source 
of confusion might be that terrestrial leeches, which are bloodsucking 
parasites, also happen to be annelids (segmented worms).

I know somebody who is very good at that sort of thing, but

Despite the IDP standards, there\'d always be non-standard, and even 
\'one-off\' designs for such equipment.  It\'s not unreasonable to expect 
that items designed for military applications will be somewhat different 
from the civilian models, besides just being sturdier.

Applicable canon indicates that Virus can indeed \'rewire\' systems by 
burning new patterns into their circuitry, but this typically doesn\'t 
occur until it\'s been successfully \'infected.\'  If Virus was just a 
program or an errant chunk of malicious data, then such behaviour should 
not be ascribed to it.  Regarding Virus as a program or as data is one 
common mistake made in efforts to \'debunk\' it.

Also, there have been examples of Virus-infected systems giving rise to 
small carriers that would actually, physically move to other uninfected 
systems in close proximity using electrostatic fields, just like their 
great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers back on Cymbeline.  Commando 
chips, anyone?
 
Naturally, there were always systems that Virus couldn\'t reach due to 
isolation.  There were likely instances where the infecting Virus system 
might have been confronted with a stubborn potential host and, due to 
some reason, didn\'t have enough time to figure out how to invade it.  In 
most of these cases, the infecting system, if it had the proper 
resources, would render the uninfectable equipment useless to its owners, 
or to competing infected systems.  That would explain any smashed 
military hand computers that might have been found after the Collapse.

There are a lot of people in the New Era, many of them ideological 
wingnuts of one stripe or another, who assert that the people who caused, 
and fought in, the Final War richly deserved the Collapse.  Of course, 
there were many things NOT to like about the stable pre-Rebellion 
background, but that\'s a whole \'nother thread.

I think Dave Nilsen said something to the effect of "It now gives the

Of course, the problem with the guys who developed the Virus weapon was 
that they were employed by Lucan who, in addition to being a harsh guy to 
work for, had a knack for getting rid of people who didn\'t see things his 
way.  If he wanted any opinions from his staff, he\'d give them one.  And 
maybe a bullet, too.  There were some people who had second thoughts, but 
one of them was an informer, and his tip led to the assassination of the 
others.

I do all of my deckplan using CorelDraw!.  The ones on my web page (The
Draconis Cluster http://users.aol.com/yanbeck/trav.htm) were all done using
Corel 5, but I\'ve since upgraded to version 6.  I\'ve used Visio 2 and never
liked it for any thing other than org charts.  Visio if fine for a drawing
that only uses pre-built objects, but when you need something that dosn\'t
already exist the Visio drawing tools pale in comparision to illustration
software (i.e., CorelDraw, Illustrator, or Freehand). Also with Visio
costing about $250 while version 4 of Corel can be had for $100, I would
recommend getting Corel.  As far as ease of use is concerned I think once
you learn to use a decent illustration software you will be glad you took
the time to do so. Should you have a questions regarding CorelDraw please
feel free to ask me (I have Corel 5 & 6 here at home and use Corel 4 at work)  

>I polled a number of folks that might be in my pbem and they *all*

As far as what is a good file format for deckplans I recommend using .GIFs.
Nether .BMPs or .PCXs use compresion to make files smaller and while .JPGs
use compresion there is some information loss and for deckplans .GIFs tend
to compress better than .JPGs anyway.

This is also a good way to do deckplans.  If you, or any one, has ship
designs with deckplan (either computer of paper formats) and would like them
on the Web the let me know and well see what we can work out.

A whole new problem there, J-space pollution! Leftover Hydrogen molecules

They might have if they\'d have had time.  Many of those who survived, 
especially those who lived in artificial environments, probably patched 
up the systems that Virus had killed with equipment that was easier to 
build and install, given the death of their previously integrated, 
computer-controlled infrastructure.  If they survived much longer, it\'s 
probably because those quick-fixes also had the nice side-effect of not 
being Virus-infectable (or -controllable).

Of course, those who survived, knew what had happened, and were able to 
apply the lessons learned, wound up building new equipment that was 
\'dumbed down\' just so that Virus couldn\'t play hob with it.  That\'s where 
the high shipboard crew requirements for TNE vessels comes from, for 
instance-- who wants to rely on automation that can be compromised?

Keep in mind that most surviving societies (the Regency, and the 
resurgent RC) sought to increase their TL while avoiding the integrated, 
computer-controlled architectures that were typical of pre-Collapse 
systems.  Of course, other survived long enough to be recontacted because 
they \'dumbed down\' their entire technological infrastructures, not just to 
avoid the possibility of Virus interference, but because they were easier 
to sustain.

Well, so what if it\'s culturally self-centered?  All we\'ve really got to 
draw on is contemporary culture, or that which has occurred earlier.  I 
find, in running my campaigns, that I must often explain future cultural 
phenomena by citing contemporary (or historical) examples.  Most often these 
serve as touchstones which aid in understanding the environment I\'m trying 
to describe, rather than irrelevancies which undermine the players\' 
suspension of disbelief in that environment.

Besides, in three thousand years, who the heck is going to care?  I\'ve 
got more serious things to worry about than whether or not the people of 
the future are going to dig up my bones and slap them around because I 
made some assertion about them eating corn dogs.

Seriously though, we don\'t know what effects it\'ll have on j-space.  For
all we know, it may have none.  I\'m not saying that it was a perfect
solution, I\'m just saying that it didn\'t break "canon."  Technically,
every version of Traveller says that the most recently published
material supercedes any prior version when there\'s a rules or

Compared to the energy required for running the drives, the drain from 
energy weapons isn\'t all that much.  Of course, that\'s if you\'re not 
overpowering them all to get a really high rate of fire.

Also, if you don\'t have secondary batteries to spare, which aren\'t busy 
engaging capital ships when the fighter/missile wave shows up, that\'s 
guns that you have to take out of the Big Fight in order to defend 
yourself from what was considered a minor nuisance.  That gives the 
opposing line some breathing space, and they continue firing on you.  
There\'s another choice that I\'d not want to have to make.  Then people 
have to start working smaller, secondary weapons systems into their 
designs to aid in the defense against missiles and fighters (CIWS, 
anyone?) while the Big Guns continue to engage the Big Targets.

A laser does not scatter in a vaccuum, if it doesn\'t hit you

True. However this particular change is quite easily shot down
from a practical engineering aspect. Besides, the engineer has plenty
to keep himself occupied in J-space. The only systems that are shut down
that are running in N-space are the thrusters.  I would say that the
time immediately prior to a jump is exceptionally busy for the
engineering department, and the slightly lower workload in J-space is
just business as usual (maintenance for the thrusters, weapons and
other out of use systems).

I\'ve found that they\'re useful primarily as recon platforms.  They can be
flown out from a fleet to the edges of detection range to try and spot the
enemy before the enemy finds the core ships of the fleet.  Then fighters
may end up fighting each other as each side tries to knock out the other
fleet\'s "eyes".  They also can be used in a pinch to try and clear small
escorts such as missile corvettes.  The capital ships are not their main
problem, and in TNE they can\'t do much against them anyway.

In this sense, having a lot of small fighting ships with good sensors is
useful.  Sensor drones have their place, too, but fighters can be pressed
into a few more uses (such as ortillery support).

It\'s not a misprint, it\'s an adventure hook!  :-)

I\'d also suggest that (legally speaking) the Imperial Family\'s stock can be
sold or transferred ... but that doing so is considered to be such an
indication of Imperial displeasure with the company (or a sign that the
Emperor believes the company\'s failure is imminent) that most non-MegaCorps
would find it hard to do business afterward.

How much of the \'purchase price\' of a starship is materials/labor and how much 
is profit?  If a government owns a shipyard outright, it seems that logically 
they would be able to build ships for less than \'blue-book\' price.

Also, any thoughts on how long (in man-hours) it takes to build a starship, or 
what facilities are needed to do so?

Oh yeah, and is there a canon figure for the price discount for a 
"standard-design" starship?

This is NOT QSDS/SSDS compliant.  I haven\'t gotten WordPerfect to translate the

The spreadsheet was built with the first printing of FF&S, and I haven\'t been

things are implemented (If anyone with Challenge #75 can email me the relevant

Any problems you do find, I need to know about so that I can fix them.  The 
project is large enough that there are bound to be things that were missed or 
that I thought I corrected and didn\'t.

Aside from that, it does seem to be able to cover most types of ship design 
fairly well....

I am particularly interested in whether it is comprehensible to

Nothing at all, if you buy it. I just find I need a little more "zap" and

their own taste. (Again, no pun intended). I just prefer more mystery and
less corn dogs. :-)

My correction stands corrected. That explains the factor of 3
difference (BTW, my calculations show the break-even point at
2.89km/s). The 5km/s "rule of thumb" was given in Grolier\'s
encyclopedia. Considering that energy rises with the square
of velocity, that\'s one heck of a rounding error. :-)

I was thinking about this and found something I think I will use in my campaign.
Since fuel is needed during the jump, I assume it is needed to hold the ship in
J-space. That means that to stay in J-space, "real world" matter needes a stable 
bubble, lets call it a J-bubble. I would think that going to "real" space from
J-space would involve some kind of radiation outburst. Therefor why not let fuel 
used during jump be ventet out of the ship into the J-bubble. As the ship moves 
so will the J-bubble and eventually the hydrogen molecules/atoms will reach the 
border of the J-bubble and leave it. As it leaves the J-bubble it is "thrown"
into "real" space, where it radiates a distinctive pattern, calles J-radiation.
A special sensor could then be designed to pick up this extremly faint (I quess
we are talking a few atoms per meter) radiation as a trail after the ship travelling
in J-space. 

Any comments????

A defensible point of view, although I do not exactly agree.  My
Traveller-related point is that the collapse of the European empires was NOT
related to poor communications: in fact, they expanded most rapidly at the
same time in which their communication was at its worst.

My own 2c. on the collapse of the European empires has more to do with the
We vs. Them attitude which that particular breed of Imperialism promoted:
The high minded civilized trustees of the poor benighted savages/colonists.
The American put up with it the longest -- they revolted first.  Canada had
two rebellions before Victoria had her throne properly warm, and two more by
the Metis later on.  The Indians tried to evict them, so did the Chinese.  

Interestingly, the wide lattitude local governments in the third imperium in
determining local afairs suggests a very different attitude on the part if
the Imperial central government.  Unless you are really intent on nuking
your neighbours, the Third Imperium is more like a ticket taker on the front
door of the universe then a conventional goverment.

Ah.  In one of the intrerviews Marc gave he mentioned that Traveller:

I\'ve never read a piece of fiction by Niven nor Pournelle (though I do 
enjoy Pournelle\'s column in _Byte_).  My wife likes their stuff, though.  I 
should probably read some of the book she has that are by them.  Might

Right.  And those on every other planet will hear it at the same time as 
well.  Example:  

Week 0:  Sternmetal Horizons, LIC\'s corporate headquarters is rocked with 
scandal.  On the HQ planet, the stock price drops like a rock.  People 
caught unawares suffer heavy paper losses, as the value of the stock they 
hold decreases dramatically.  Some sell at the lower price, others hold 
on hoping Sternmetal can redeem itself.  The original traders that sold 
and started the freefall in price made out OK, though.

Week 1:  A Free Trader carries the information to Dumbo\'s World, which is 
one parsec away from HQ.  The people there hear about the scandal and the 
drop in stock price, and they sell like mad as well.  Assuming the stock 
exchage on this world doesn\'t update its prices based on other worlds\' 
trading prices (an unlikely thing given communications lag and the number 
of worlds involved!), all this means is that the same stock price 
scenario happens here as on the HQ world.

Week 2:  The same Free Trader carries the information to Windex World, 
which is two parsecs away from HQ and one from Dumbo\'s World.  The 
information is relayed, and the same scenario happens.

Week 1(again):  A Fast Trader (capable of Jump-3) gets to a world three 
parsecs from HQ, one from Windex World, and two from Dumbo\'s World.  Even 
in this case, the same scenario reoccurs.

So, I can\'t see the communications lag affecting anything in a 
free-market economy.  Currency exchanges, boards of trade, stocks, 
bonds...it would all be treated the same way.

Good thought!  The old scam of holding up the telegraphed information

In regimental strength, the Imperial Marines represent the Imperium\'s main
striking force, but there had better be some 500k-ton transports filled with
the Army to back them up.

If you drop a squad or so, however, the Marines are a dagger.  They can hit
fast and hard, taking out Grand Poobah for Eternity Fred before the first
bite of breakfast has passed his lips.  Or, scout out probable meson sites,
or try to seize the starport traffic control center.. The casulties are
high, but the glory is great, and the uniform really helps pick up dates.

Sniper teams are assigned to the regiments.. used on a situational basis.

Point of order:  The Rangers were mis-used by the higher levels of command,
especially at Anzio, where the 2nd Ranger Battalion was all but destroyed.
Rangers are not light infantry, they don\'t carry enough support weapons to
fill that role.

In other actions, Point du Hoc most notably, when Rangers were used in their
Special Warfare role, they performed with distinction.

In the Gulf War, *12* Navy Seals raised such a ruckus in Kuwait City as the
ground phase began; that the Iraqi general in command radioed Baghdad in the
clear that he was being overrun by at least two USMC Divisions!

I think that the "dirty tricks brigade" would be mostly Scouts, who are
skilled at infiltrating.

Also, the Merc: 2000 system had a Special Operations handbook, can\'t recall

to be Richard Marchinko\'s -Rogue Warrior- books.  This guy *is* a Traveller
character.

Navy).  Since Marines tend to see themselves as an elite, they tend to try
to out-do everyone.  My image of Imperial Marine organization is that every
numbered Fleet has two Regiments assigned to it.  The regiments trade off
between training and fleet cycles.  At changeover, ships turn over their
Marine compliments.

Some people will therefore have "insider information."  That is true 
today.  It is illegal in the US, nevertheless it happens that people 
trade on insider information - and I don\'t doubt that most go uncaught.  

Perhaps, in the Far Future, acquiring trading information prior to its 
public release, then trading based on that information, will be illegal 
as well.

When I learned of the psuedo pony-express network the Mongols used, I was 
delighted.  It\'s one of those tidbits that should be taught in basic history 
classes (to whet the students\' apetites), but aren\'t (at least not in the 
ones I took).

Until someone provides better figures, we can go with 2 months.  So, the 
size of the Imperium was governed by how far the fastest ship could 
travel in two months - if we take our assumptions for fact.  That would 
peg Imperial expansion to new developments in jump drive technology.  
During times between those developments, the Imperium\'s borders would 
stay relatively stable.  Expansion beyond the two-month area would be 
short-lived at best.

Unless, of course, there were local governments which were given wide 
latitude in ruling.  In that case, you could have 
2-month-travel-time-diameter circles of power all over the place.  Sorry, 
I don\'t recall whether this was the case with the Sector Dukes. Were they 
petty much autonomous?

Ah, yes!  That must be it, then.

Hehehee.  Well, I don\'t eat them frequently.  But, like cotton candy and

Liam,

I have a theory about that.  I\'ve noticed that the more complete the 
post, the fewer the replies.  Of course, the more useless the post, the 
fewer the replies as well. I guess it is a bell-shaped curve.  Ask a 
really thought-provoking question, and you\'ll get tons of replies.  If 
the question is at all controversial (and few good questions aren\'t!), 
the replies will get replies.  And so on.  That\'s the top of the curve.

But if you post something like we\'ve all seen members of this list do... 
something so complete and useful, that there is nothing to say but "thank 
you" or "good job," and you won\'t see many replies.  Few want to fill up 
the list with nothing but posts consisting of a quote and "Great Job!"  
That\'s the stuff for email.

Anyway, that\'s the reason I see for your ship designs, weapon designs, 
etc. getting hardly a reply.  They\'re useful posts, very necessary and 
welcome on the list.  But they\'re complete...nothing can be added to them.

So, when you make such a post, be it a ship design or an exhaustively 
detailed study of some aspect of the Imperium, and you get no response:
consider that a standing ovation. :)

PS:  I try to remember to email the folks who post stuff that is 
particularly of use, but I must admit I often fail in this.  I see 
the post, think, "whoo hoo!," export it to the server, download it, and 
print it out.   By the time I sign on again, I\'m afraid I\'ve often 
forgotten about my benefactor.  I apologize to those whose work has 
enriched my gaming but who I have not thanked.

Very good point, Joe...

Actually, there\'s a very good example of this on present day 
Earth...DeBeers...they own the majority of the diamond market.  If 
anybody else discovers diamonds, they buy them out, or expect them to 
fall in line.  DeBeers artificially regulates the price of diamonds 
by limiting supply...

This sort of thing could be even easier on an interstellar scale...

Actually, I was a bit cranky about it earlier.  As a result of a 
reread (more like a reskim really) I take back a little bit about 
H&I.  I didn\'t particularly like the writing style, and there was a 
great deal of departure from the way in which the Hivers were written 
in both earlier JTAS articles, and the previous CT alien module...  I 
guess that bothered me more than anything else.  They took a good, 
well developed alien, rewrote, and added way too much weak humor...

No...I guess not, for someone who doesn\'t have the old stuff.  But I have 
enough problems with it being a departure from previously published 
stuff, that I can\'t get over that fact.  There is definitely enough 
stuff to run them as a race, but it would be a different enough alien 
as to bear little resemblance to the CT Hivers...

I\'ve thought about this sort of thing a number of times while reading 
science fiction.  It IS a quandry, isn\'t it?  The author can either have 
the characters speaking in what, to us, would be gibberish (which the 
author would then have to, rather laboriously, explain) most of the time, 
or the author can sprinkle the text with gibberish (which can be 
explained here and there) and keep the rest to what a 20th century reader 
can understand the referent for immediately.

The first is very realistic, but not too fun to read.  The second is less 
realistic, but is fun to read.  It\'s obvious why authors tend to choose 
the second. :)

Still, that doesn\'t make it realistic.  

I guess, as usual, it depends.  What you are doing will determine which 
method you use.   In a sourcebook for a game, the main text should use the 
second method.  Introduce new concepts and terms (such as jump drive, 
HEPlaR, etc.) as needed, but explain them in 20th-century terms.  You\'re 
trying to impart knowledge to the reader, after all.  But the 
"sidelights" or local color bits (like those used in the Starship 
Operator\'s Manual) can use the first method - without explanation!  Have 
the characters talk like they would if they were real. Sure, that much 
will be total gibberish to those who haven\'t read the main text.  But 
that\'s OK, as you WANT them to read the main text. :)

I don\'t have H&I.  But if it follows that rule, then the reference to 
corndogs wouldn\'t bother me.  If not, it might.

Why, are you planning on opening a shipyard?  :)

Seriously, that\'s a good question.  Knowing the /cost/ of the components 
(including labor) would open up all sorts of interesting activities to 
players...

Hmmm.  T\'would take someone more knowledgeable than me to say how 
difficult it would be to sort out a few atoms per meter in deep space, 
and at what distance it would be possible (in the Far Future) to do so.  
Nonetheless, it sounds like a really neat gimmick.  Something I would

This is what I was getting at in my earlier post...I imagine that this
type of system would be much more fun to play.  After all, what\'s the fun
in playing in a perfect environment.

Also, this presents a vast number of lucrative enterprises on worlds off
of x-boat communications lines.  Look at all the information services we
have today...For some price (in direct proportion to the speed with which
the information is presented), one could subscribe to an offworld news
provider.

I am interested in hearing about those ideas...I have a couple of my own

>From: "Andrew Wardell" <wardell@m1.sprynet.com>
>Subject: Ship Construction Costs

These questions are of particular interest to me.  Aside from the small
group that thinks Starship construction and operation is more akin to
airplanes, I think everyone agrees that ocean going vessels are a much
better model than most others.  This pleases me, since I have been working
in a ship yard for the past 17 months, and my dad has been in the business
for the past 15 to 20 years.  I\'m glad when the discussion comes to an area
where I feel I have some expertise.


>Does there exist, or has anyone given any thought to the COST of ship 
>construction, as opposed to its PRICE?

Now, to answer your questions.  First, I\'m in purchasing at the yard I work
at, so I don\'t get involved with a lot of the accounting, but IIRC we
typically shoot for anywhere from 15 to 25 percent "profit" on a first
vessel.  If the job is a multple vessel job, the subsequent hulls will
naturally bring home more profit.  So, to answer your question, 15 to 25
percent cost for a first or single hull, and about an additional 5 to 10
percent for additional hulls (up to about five when the profit margin gets
even higher).  In reality, it would depend on the company that built the
ship with influence as to the location of the ship yard, and the tech level.

>How much of the \'purchase price\' of a starship is materials/labor and how much 
>is profit?

As a rule of thumb, a surface vessel will split cost evenly between
materials and labor.  As I said before, the price to cost ratio will vary
with the number of hulls in the job, as well as other factors.


>  If a government owns a shipyard outright, it seems that logically 
>they would be able to build ships for less than \'blue-book\' price.

I can\'t speak for the Imperium, but the US (and many foreign countries)
don\'t build ships themselves.  Much of the high-tech outfitting is done at
the naval shipyards, but the actual ships are constructed by another
facility (Trinity Marine, Ingles, & Bollinger to name a few).  We are
working on a navy project right now, and because of the "Buy American Act,"
the "Small/Small Disadvantaged Business Laws," & and other legislation the
price we charge the Navy is actually higher than a civillian would pay for
the same exact product.  I think many of the larger governments have their
own repair facilities, but purchase their ships from a private company.  One
of my companies primary customers (aside from the US Navy) is the Phillipine
Coast Guard.


>Also, any thoughts on how long (in man-hours) it takes to build a starship, or 
>what facilities are needed to do so?

During the last discussion on construction times, I worked out the example
from the navy contract we were working on at the time (the same one we\'re
doing know).  With a little bit of research, I found the original post...

I would expect to see Starship production times to be similar.  Yes, the
technology has improved, but so has the material that is being worked with.


>Oh yeah, and is there a canon figure for the price discount for a 
>"standard-design" starship?

I know the 10 percent for a "standard hull" is mentioned in MT, and I think
it is included in FF&S as well.  The new systems (QSDS & SSDS) both include
a standardization discount based on the amount of standardation used by the
hull.

I hope this helps answer your questions, if you have any others, let me
know.  BTW, I figure someone else will bring up the 747 analogy soon enough,
so I wont burden an already long post with the details of that!


>"Aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the play?"

I\'m sure someone (probably a son or daughter) really asked this question too.

This is my very arguement for the necessary use of hydrogen in J-drives
(preventing an all Antimatter J-drive).  Hydrogen is used because its
simplicity allows it to interact with the J-universe without causing too
much trouble.  In my universe (and I hope in MMT) the hydrogen "pressure" of
the bubble surrounding the ship must be kept up or the effects of J-space
encroach upon the ship.  This is where one of my MAJOR problems with SOM (an
otherwise excellent supplement) was.  We are told that if by some chance
Jump space gets too close to the ship, it can cause severe damage and
possibly destroy the ship, but the engineer has nothing to do with the jump
drive during jump.  In my universe, the Astrogator and the Engineering crew
take turns on "Jump watch" more to be present if a problem occurs than to
watch for a problem.  The computer moniters the "tumble" of the ship, the
energy trickle to the hydrogen bubble, and the "pressure of the bubble
itself while in jump, and the crewman on Jump Watch keeps a check on the
computer.  If the computer detects a slight variation, alarms go off, and
the crewman attempts to correct the problem if he can.

The governments of the French, Dutch, Italians, English, and Germans
of the 17th and 18th century still did everything they could to
maximize the amount of gold they had.  Did *they* think the gold
brought back from the new world destroyed the Spanish economy?  I
doubt it.

Did the English and Dutch privateers who stole shiploads of gold do it
to save the Spanish from themselves?  <g> Nah!  They did it because
they believed gold was wealth, and they wanted it for themselves and
their countries.

The ruination of the Spanish economy had more to do with a long
seccession of poor leaders, their support for the oppression and
expulsion of the Spanish jews, and their military mis-adventures all
around the world...IMO.

It might be Joe, but that won\'t stop people from trying, and as you
say most go uncaught.  OTOH, this isn\'t really "insider information." 

If you pick up the paper this morning and notice that Intel reports a
drop in earnings, and you place a sell order with your broker you\'re
perfectly legal in doing so..right?  Well, I don\'t *see* the paper
until tomorrow afternoon, and when I place my sell order you\'ve
(contributed) caused the price to drop already.  So, can I sue you for
my lost in value?  Can the government get you for insider trading?
Nope, the information was available to everyone, if you happened to
see it before me that\'s your good luck and my bad luck.

Now let\'s say you hear that Megacorp Mining has struck the motherlode
here in the Aster belt, and you hop aboard your Jump 4 ship and hop
over to Sucker III 4 parsecs away.  Arriving there you notice that
Megacorp Mining is trading at 8cr/share, so you buy 50,000 shares.  A
couple of weeks later the news of MM\'s good fortune reaches Sucker and
the share price goes up to 12cr.  You sell out clearing a cool
200,000!  Was this illegal?  Unethical?  Maybe.  I\'m sure the current
US government would say it was, but I\'m not so sure.  Personally, I
think it\'s just plain smart trading. <g> I\'m positive local exchanges
(and governments) would find ways to blunt this type of thing though.

Where? Survival Margin indicated that Strephon reemphasized the
Domains in an attempt to *counter* increased factionalism (presumably
by bringing Imperial Government closer to the people).  The Archdukes
were supposed to make the government more responsive, and more
concerned with the local situation.  Of course, he may well have been
wrong, especially given that Dulinor\'s idea of "Power to the People"
became "Power to Dulinor\'s People".  Imperial history indicates that
prior to the Civil War, Archdukes were more powerful and independent,
and that their powers were greatly reduced following the war
(presumably because they predominantly sponsored the pretenders to the
throne, or at least did little to hinder them.)

There are two entry points for Missiles. One is the Number of Missles,
the other is the Type of Missiles. The Type of Missiles _must_ be 1 or 2.
If you set this to zero you get the errors you report.

If you want a ship with no missiles set the Number of Missiles to zero and
leave the Type of Missiles at either 1 or 2.

That should work fine.

But let\'s say that Megacorp high tech goods is negotiating with government
officials to build a new line of starships for the Imperium.  This
contract will be into the Trillions.  Magacorp and government officials
know that this is coming down the pipe, so they start to buy up stock
(through spouses, relations, what have you) prior to the announcement at
which time MegaCorp high tech goods stocks sky rocket.  

Or let\'s say the reverse, the contract is going to be cancelled and prior
to that official release, government officials and MegaCorp company
officers (or their wives, relations, etc.) start dumping stock.

I suspect that these activities will be illegal.

Hiver & Ithklur on this list (and the person who came up with the 
nickname "Sneeks & Geeks"), I think I set the tone for subsequent bashing 
of this product.  As a long-time Traveller player (since 1979) and owner 
of almost everything published for the game, I was offended by the 
juvenile humor of the Ithklur section, and was rather lukewarm about the 
Hiver section.  In comparison to GDW\'s original Aliens modules and 
especially DGP\'s Cogs & Dogs and Rats & Cats, Sneeks & Geeks was poorly 
organized, repetitive, and forced in its humor.

  I want to make clear, however, that I like The New Era in general - 
more than Megatraveller, certainly.  Path of Tears got me interested in 
playing Traveller again after a several-year hiatus, and I thought (and 
still think) that Virus was a cool idea with lots of implications for 
adventures.  I reviewed a number of products negatively - Sneeks & Geeks, 
of course, as well as the novels (talk about turgid writing!) - but 
overall I like the RC and the Regency as settings.  I especially liked 
the Regency Sourcebook - if Sneeks & Geeks had been done that way I\'d 
never have objected.  Much of my reaction to TNE was conditioned by the 
rather depressing nature of MT and the gradual collapse of civilization - 
Hard Times is one of the most depressing gaming supplements I\'ve ever read.

  As for corndogs, this was not just a Sneeks & Geeks joke, but a 
long-running gag in the Traveller News Service.  As a minor background 
joke, I thought it was rather funny. 

  It will be interesting to see how well Imperium Games does - I plan to 
keep collecting, and I\'m looking forward to reviewing their products as 
well.

1, and I\'ve noted the continuing improvement in quality with pleasure.  
While still not up to the production values and content of JTAS, 
Challenge, or Traveller\'s Digest, the last few issues of TC are quite good.

  As others have noted, the primary focus of Issue 10 is the Solomani Rim 
in the New era.  16 subsector maps with data for systems for both 1117 
and 1202 occupy 16 pages, with another 10 pages of text describing 
significant features of the sector, are very well done - certainly as 
good as any of the sector supplements produced by GDW and others.  With 
an index and other information, the Solomani Rim section makes up 36 
pages out of 56.

  According to the editorial, future issues will detail the major polical 
entities of the Solomani Rim and provide equipment and ship designs for 
Classic, MT, and New Era settings - it looks like this will be Sword of 
the Knight\'s pocket empire for the near future.  The Terran Republic, a 
pocket empire centered on Earth, seems especially interesting, as a 
non-fanatical religeous empire.  I\'ve always thought that religion was 
one of the most neglected aspect of Traveller - I\'m looking forward to 
the next issue.

  One interesting piece of information is in the writeup for Arcturus 
Subsector on the planet Cymbeline (the source of the Deyo chips used in 
Imperial Transponder circuits and Virus).  This mentions that Vampire 
ships make "pilgramages" to Cymbeline (to visit their ancestors?) and 
come away with altered programing, an "Evangelical Doomslayer" strain 
that wants revenge on Lucan for nuking Cymbeline in the late stages of 
the Wars of the Rebellion.  The altered Vampires then head Coreward to 
try and find Lucan.  This explains the "Vampire Highway" from the 
RC material.  I have not seen this explanation in print before, though I 
may have missed it, and I rather like it.

  The remainder of the issue is an adventure.  One nice aspect is that 
the setup provides three settings - Reformation Coalition, Regency, or 
the Traveller Chronicles own Far Frontiers.  A typical rescue scenario, 
the adventure is well written, though the final resolution of the mystery 
brings those naughty Ancients in again.

  Overall, a solid effort, though the interior art is still substandard 
(nice cover, though) - well worth the purchase price.  Most useful for 
TNE GMs, though for folks without the old GDW Solomani Rim supplement 
this is a cheap way to get that data.  Two thumbs up.

Actually, it\'s unlikely that there are *major* fluctuations in
elemental abundances in the small area the Imperium covers. But if you
are mining asteroids, it\'s not that much extra trouble to seperate out
*everything* rather than just leave the "tailings" sitting there. 

Assume that gold or iridium occurs at 1 part per billion (1e-9) in
nickel iron asteroids. That means that a cubic kilometer of such
asteroid will have around 8 tonnes of them. They are more likely to be
in parts per million, which gives you *thousands* of tonnes of them.

When you get right down to it, all *any* currency really is, is
bookkeeping. An organized system of IOUs. 

Before currency, you had to use barter. And if what I had to trade
wasn\'t what you wanted, I had to trade it to someone who *did* have
something you wanted, then trade that to you. 

With currency, I can sell my goods to whoever wants them, and get
currency in exchange. Then I can trade the currency to you for what I
want.  The currency amounts to a *generalized* IOU.

This is a tricky concept. Currency really *doesn\'t* have any "backing"
except the people\'s confidence that they can get things in exchange for
it. This *can* be considered to be "backed" by the strength of the
economy, but that\'s not a view I agree with.

Given this, interstellar trade and currency are a bit easier to figure
out. Imperial currency is spendable almost everywhere because everyone
knows that all traders will accept it. Planetary currency is probably
spendable on planets that do a lot of trade with the planet of origin.
Otherwise, it\'s of little value.

The USSR provides some good examples of the complexity you can encounter.
They had several different rubles. The internal ruble, which was not
convertible to any other currency and wasn\'t worth much anyway. It had a
fixed exchange rate (this was what they made tourists convert their
currency into) but that was only for converting foreign currency into
rubles. And the official exchange rate was nowhere near the buying
power (the foreign currency was worth a lot more than the rubles you
got). There was also a foreign exchange ruble, which was exchangeable
for gold, but not allowed to be used internally. And of course, there
was the "real" ruble. That\'s what you could *actually buy for a ruble
on the black market (which wasn\'t much). There may even have been a
difference between the rubles they gave tourists and the ones they gave
citizens. The tourist rubles were worth more because you could by
things in special shops that didn\'t take regular rubles, and normally
sold only to tourists and high Party officials.

Also consider the value of the dollar inside the USSR, officially it
had a low value, so they\'d only give you a few "tourist rubles" per
dollar. But, citizens would give you a *lot* of rubles for one (if they
were sure they wouldn\'t get caught with them). On the black market a
dollar was probably worth a few hundred rubles.

Because of this, many companies doing business with the USSR resorted
to barter, because their sales were in internal rubles, which couldn\'t
be taken out of the country. So for example, Pepsi worked out a deal
where they got a liter of Stolichoynya vodka for every liter of Pepsi
they sold.

So you can see how complex exchange rates get. 

The tech level differences in exchange rates are reasonable, as a lower
tech planet has less to sell. But they may try pegging the exchange
rate at 1-1 so as to maintain a favorable trade balance. In such a
case, the trader will probably try trading his goods for other goods
rather than selling them for local currency and then buying goods with
that.

I rather expect that normal practice will be to take any local currency
and exchange it for goods or Imperial credits before you lift out.
Otherwise you may wind up with a lot of worthless pieces of paper. 

I expect that the Imperial credit\'s value does "float" from place to
place. But given travel times, it\'s easier to treat it as having a
fixed value.

Heinlein noted that the way he and his wife compared the economies of
the many different countries they visited was to find out how many
hours a journeyman carpenter had to work to buy a kilo of the local
"bread".

It equates equivalent work with an equivalent good. Otherwise you get
into situations like the one in "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur\'s
Court" where you have someone saying he\'s better off because he gets 10
dollars an hour and you only get 5, but ignoring the fact that he\'s
paying 3 times what you are for food and shelter.

It doesn\'t matter if hamburger is $100/lb as long as there\'s plenty of
hamburger *and* you get paid enough to afford it.

As an example, here in Oregon, we have had a lot of folks move up here
from California, and they willingly paid housing prices that natives
wouldn\'t. The result is that in the last 5-10 years rental prices have
*tripled*, but wages haven\'t gone up near as much. The result is that
many people live in *lousy* housing.

It\'s not the amount of labor that counts. It\'s what you can *buy* for
that much labor.

It actually didn\'t do as much as you might think. For one thing, there
are *two* minerals known as "jade". Jadeite and Nephrite. The find was
nephrite which isn\'t as valuable.

The other major factor is that a lot of semiprecious stones have a good
part of their worth being due to their *appearance*. So while the price
of nephrite dropped, it can only drop so far because it still looks good.

This resembles the "utility" theory of worth. (ie a thing\'s worth is
based on was use you can make of it).

Slight problem. If we are in a vacuum (or at least as close to one as
you get in most systems), you won\'t *know* that a laser beam missed
you. It\'s not like you can *see* the beam.

With a PAW you could probably detect the effects of this huge charged
particle beam going by. With an NPAW, you couldn\'t even do that.

This *really* needs to be considered in many combat situations. Tghe
first thing you may know about an attack is when they get their first
*hit* on you.

To fire a warning shot with a laser, you nail the target *dead on*, but
at reduced power. Not enough to damage, but enough to send quite a
flash over any optical sensors it hits.

Heck with that. I want to know what kind of atmosphere will bounce

If you want the pilot to "live" it has to be radiating at *at least*
300 K. That\'s *way* above the 3K background. 

My though it to try enclosing the fighter in an non-reflective
"bubble", big enough that the rate the *bubble* radiates at is
reasonable for a hunk of rock at that distance from the star. You have
cheap, throwaway passive sensor arrays as part of the bubble. They\'d
just be the antennas, the electronics would be on the fighter.

So it just sits there, looking like a rock (a big one, but a rock
nonetheless) and waits for you to get close. 

Such a bubble will be expensive, but not terribly so. I don\'t have the
formulas handy so I can\'t calculate the size required, but let\'s say
it\'s a kilometer in diameter. You dump a little bit of gass to inflate
it, possibly even use some extra to give you some *convective* cooling.

I get about 10 million m^2 of material, and 524 million cubic meters. 
Assuming the material weighs one gram per square meter (doable), it\'ll
mass 10 tonnes. If it weighs more, the weight goes up linearly. If you
fill it with gases to 1 gram per liter (about 1 atmosphere) it\'d take
524 tonnes of gas. If you fill it to 1/100th of an atmosphere, it\'ll
only take 5 tonnes, but that oout to both fill it out, and give some
help with evening the heat load. So we get a 15 tonne *mass* package
that can be deployed to hide a fighter. 

You *could* put more in it, but you risk making it too warm.

Not for long. It *takes* more energy to create antimatter than you get
back by "burning" it. So unless you have access to a "natural" source
of antimatter, antimatter is merely a means of *storing* energy, not of
*producing* it.

Don\'t forget Calvin & Hobbes (Oh the glories of playing Calvin Ball!).  Oh,
yeah, don\'t forget the references to 2001!

Really, these things don\'t bother me a whole lot.  I think part of the
reason that we don\'t have a more intimate knowledge of what happened in the
mid and early BC culture is primarily because of the lack of documentation
of cultural events (compared to modern documentation).  With all the items
being saved on CD-ROMs and other hi-tech medium, I don\'t think a knowledge
of our culture would be too difficult to obtain.  Also remember that the RC
(TNE\'s main area) was at one time a Solomani world, and as such would have
many Solamani influences.  Just look at what many third world countries term
American Imperialism if you have any doubts of the Solomani taking their
culture and instilling it into the culture of worlds they find.

While I wouldn\'t dare to argue that this is probable, but I will stand
behind my belief that it is possible!  I had a history teacher who, through
the course of the semester, showed us how many ancient cultural things we
still do.  Many of them surprised me.  I don\'t think that this influence
from our culture is all that impossible.

Actually, I agree with you here.  Personally, I enjoy the humor in the book,
but I KNOW that it is the type of humor that is not enjoyed by everyone.
When I was reading the book, I\'d read a paragraph or two and laugh at the
contents and then I\'d show it to my wife and she would just look at me with
that "how stupid" look.  It occurred to me then that not everyone would
enjoy H&I because of the humor in it, but I did like the development.

Out of curiosity, are the changes such that they can be attributed to the
imperium not understanding the Hiver, or are they completely incompatible?
IIRC, MT said that little was really known about the Hiver because the area
of space they lived in wa so far from the main areas of Imperial Operations.
Remember the RC are intimately familiar with the Hiver and their culture.
Is it possible that the differences are things that were thought to be true
of the Hiver, but now with the RC being so closely involved with them we
know are not true?  (Remember, I don\'t have any of the CT stuff other than
Research Station Gamma.)

This is a BIG (Read: HUGE, ENORMOUS, GARGANTUAN) assumption.  First off, you
wouldn\'t be using what Traveller calls Engineers (at least not what we first
think of).  The only real place we have for these guys in our ship yard is
in the Maintenance Dept, and they rarely work on ships.  Some of your cost
is going to people who in Traveller would best be described as Business
Professionals (could be Engineers) with a high Starship Architecture skill.
Starting pay for these types IIRC is $25K with top levels being as high as
$50K to $75K.  Most of your cost is going to go to Construction workers.
These fellows make $6.00 to $13.00 an hour.  We typically work the yard
48-60 hours a week depending on how far behind we are.  In our ship yard
(and I think as the norm) we have welders, fitters, painters, and helpers
(the yards that do vessels as opposed to jus barges add electrical and
mechanical).  The experience of the worker is going to determine how much he
makes.

>Second lets assume 100% loading. Ie. that the administrative

This is not true at all.  The software industry must have a high overhead
rate!!  In our shipyard, we have about 200 employees whose pay is charged to
the job, and about 25 "overhead" employees who don\'t charge their time
directly to a job.  As I\'m in purchasing, I don\'t know the actual pay
figures for people, but my guess is that our overhead pay is close to $70K
to 80K per month.  Our job direct employees would be in the neighborhood of
$450K per month.  Of course, since I\'ve been here we have never had fewer
than three hulls in the yard, and about every other job is a multiple hull
job.  A typical contract is for $8 to 10 Million (8,000,000) per hull.  This
is for a barge with no propulsion or crew quarters.  Just a bunch of cargo
space and painting and , depending on the type, we also add piping, pumps,
and generators or engines to run the pumps (for cargo handling).  Anyway,
the point is, that I would consider a typical ship yard to have overhead at
20 to 25 percent of job direct labor.  Of course, I wasn\'t including Labor
in my figures the other day, and whil they were slop figures and very
conservative, the excess wouldn\'t be enough to cover the entire overhead
figure.  Also, most yards would probably be part of a corporation that had a
main office that charged overhead.  That overhead wasn\'t in my figure
either, and I have no idea how much that number would be, but I do know that
it would be split between at least two yards (although only two or three
yards centralized overhead would probably be run from one of the yards.)

These figures are all costs, the price would only be 15 to 25 percent of
that, and you should use the price figure to come up with the accurate labor
numbers.  Also, I\'m curious what the "cannon" time to build these other
ships is.  I don\'t think I agree with the 9 month figure to build a Std
Scout.  I would probably list is as at least a year and consider it a quick
project.  I mentioned in my post that it was going to take almost 3 years to
build a 600Td hull (Barge only, add at least 6 mo for a ship).  This is a
typical time for Government jobs.  Civillian Jobs take a bit less, maybe two
years.  This time is pretty standard for hulls from 250Td to 900Td.  The
smaller hulls would take probably a year and a half on average.  I\'d be
interested to see how your figures match the current norms based on what I
believe to be a more accurate construction time.  I\'ll get with the
Production Controll guy here and get some numbers on manhours for different
size hulls, and post that later if the interest continues.

Shipyard workers are very migratory.  For example, Down here on the coast,
many of our yard workers quit during shrimp season and go out to run their
shrimp boat until the season is over, at which time they come back and hire
on again.

The shipbuilding community usually runs on a three to six year cycle, that
is every three to four years there is more work than there is yards.  The
idea is to get work lined up for your yard to last throughout the coming
slump.  Its not easy, but that\'s what makes the estimators hair grey.  ;)

This is true to some extent, but I\'ve never seen a shipyard at 100 percent
capacity.  Naturally, you want to make the most of every inch of your
facility, but this really isn\'t practical.  I\'d expect the average to be
around 55 to 60 percent capacity.  Of course, often a good 25 to 35 percent
of your capacity is taken up by repair jobs.  Repair jobs are a different
story altogether.  The fariance in repair jobs is so vast, that it is
difficult to even set a standard.  For example, a simple job, like blasting
and repainting a set of deck barges is usually a cash cow for yards.  Other
jobs, like re-outfitting a barge, can take your shirt along with all your
money.  It is an art to know which jobs to bid on and shich to refuse.

The reality of the Shipworkers unions is much less dramatic than that of the
United Railworkers Union, the United Autoworkers Union, or any of the other
"highly visible" Unions here in America.  In reality, the Union does the job
it is supposed to, that is working with management as a representative of
the employees as a whole to improve working conditions.


Sorry to those of you who aren\'t interested in this stuff, but finally the
topic has come around the circle to something I know about and can talk
somewhat intelligently about.  Hope this helps folks better understand
Traveller shipbuilding.  When I find the time, I\'m gonna try to work up an
information type document on my take on Traveller starship construction.
I\'ll post it to the list for comment

I went out with my wife to eat last night, and the resteraunt was a bit
crowded and we were led to our table.  I sat down in the straight back chair
and we started talking.  Not long after I sat down, I realized that I was
uncomfortable with the position of my seat.  Not how I was sitting in it,
but it\'s location compared to the rest of the room.  This isn\'t the first
time this has happened, and I told my wife I didn\'t like the seat.  We
talked about it for a bit, and I came to realize that the only problem was
that my back was towards a substantial part of the resteraunt!  I got to
thinking about it, and whenever I was uncomfortable with a seating like
this, it turned out that I was in the same predicament, with my back to the
room.

I laughed as I told my wife about how in one of my first adventures (Role
Master for what it\'s worth), I went into a bar, and took an empty table,
sitting down to watch the group outside.  Little did I know that our Ref had
graced this bar with a bully and his buds!  Needless to say, while I was
supposed to be keeping an eye open to be "assistance in hiding" if the rest
of the group needed it, I was busy getting the fire beat out of me because I
got jumped from behind by the thugs.

I guess this just goes to show you that Role Playing can have an effect on
how you live your life!!

Just out of curiosity, I recently made some rough estimates of the equipment
value of the Gram "Mechanized Infantry" battalion from _Broadsword_.  They\'re
a lift infantry unit equipped to tech-11, which probably makes them fairly
representative of the average planetary army unit in the Imperium.

The battalion has two lift infantry companies and a "combat support" company
that is basically cavalry -- tanks, air/rafts, and artillery.  MegaTraveller
rules were used to equip the unit.  Vehicles were selected from DGP\'s _101
Vehicles_; the GCarrier and Air/Raft were tech-10 vehicles chosen based on
resemblance to Book 3 designs.  Troops were assumed to cost on average 
kCr 30 to equip.  Everyone gets kCr 20 for combat armor; personal weapon for
most is assumed to be a kCr 1 ACR, which leaves kCr 9 for survival kits,
commdots, radios, entrenching tools, miscellaneous electronic gadgets like
hand computers, and their share of squad weapons and miscellaneous gear.

This came out to:
  Gram Grav APC x 43            ==  MCr 266.8
  Gram Grav Tank x 5            ==  MCr  66.4
  Tarsan Kariku G-Carrier x 40  ==  MCr 182.6
  Traveler Air/Raft x 6         ==  MCr   5.7 
  tech-11 troops x 311          ==  MCr   9.3
                                    ----
                                    MCr 530.8  

This is in the price range of a small naval escort -- the _Vigilante_ costs
about MCr 600, and has a naval crew of 10 or so, plus landing boat crew and
its\' troop complement.  I think a merchant could buy a 2000 ton TI for this,
admittedly at tech-15.

My economic estimates of the entire Imperium, circa 1100, using WTH, came
up with the astounding figure of about 146 million army battalions in the
entire Imperium, circa 1100.  That comes to 14000 per world, or about 
167000 per HiPop world, which I think is near Rebellion Sourcebook.  Now,
lets assume that all ground forces in the Imperium cost this much per 
battalion.

Total equipment cost for 146 million tech-11 army battalions:  TCr 77500.

Wildstar got an annual figure of TCr 2237 for planetary army budget.  Now,
lets assume that this figure must support all the army units above, and 
that we don\'t need to worry about air force or wet navy units.  Ignoring
perishable supplies and ammo, bases, and salaries, it would probably take
at least 40 years for an entire equipment replacement cycle.  This gets
worse at higher, more expensive, tech levels, or if larger or more expensive
battalions are assumed.

        Frankly, I have to say I\'ve never liked the Virus.  (As a plot
device, I make no statements as to how possible it is.)  Mainly, I thought
of it as GDW selling out the Traveller universe to the fashionable \'dark
future/cyberpunk\' fad.
        Anyway, I\'ve been thinking along the lines of an \'alternate
history.\'  Everything is the same, until the aperance of the Virus.
Unfortionately, while I have lots of neat ideas, materials are lacking.
Notably, thanks to consistent cash problems, the main MT set is all I have
for that era (and what I\'ve seen discussed here).
        Is there anyone who feels the same way, and would like to work out a
\'dim future\' version of the events of 1120+, or am I alone in this?

I just calculated the numbers and came up with 

   4.33 x 10^15 
   3.82 x 10^13

molekyles per cubic meter. For the first number I used the central density of the sun,
and the second is the mean density of the sun. I first calculated the number of hydrogen
molekyles used by my falcon systemjumper (look at http://www.ifi.uio.no/~tommyg/Trav/falcon.html).
It is a 200 dt TL10 starship with jump 1 capabilities. I used

number of molekyles = ((280 m^3)* density of liq.hyd.)/(mass of hydrogen atom)

this number is then divided by the volume of a rectangle made by the dimensions of the ship 
times the travelling lenght. I used a height of 10 meters and a width of 20 meters. 1 parsec
equals 3.857 x 10^16 meter. 

looking at the numbers above this is a large numbers of atoms and I would guess that the
trail is high visible. The density of this hydrogen trail will be 
 
   7.25 x 10^-12 kg per m^3
   6.39 x 10^-14 kg per m^3
 
which compared to interstellar gas and dust with a mass density of 10^-23 kg per m^3 it is 
very large. The track of the ship would be highly visible I guess, but something about this 
calculation is not right, I think. I can\'t se any clear mistake but my brain flashes a small
red warningsign in the background. Anybody agree with this calculations.

Hey, Mark,

I agree completely. I thought TNE was wonderful - for the first year or so,
before the quality of the products started to drop off. Then the level of
writing and humor started bugging me. Then the art became so awful, I
couldn\'t even look at it anymore. (As a graphics person, I felt
particularly sad about this decline. Good art was always, for me, a
hallmark of Traveller). But I still *enjoyed* TNE\'s setting, and especially
the rules overall...Even if I am mathematically challenged, and shuddered
ever time I\'d pick up FF&S.

Originally, I assumed TNE would blow everything else away. The fisrt few
releases were simply great. But early on, it seemed as if the project was
too ambitious for GDW. Remember the encyclopedia FF&S was *supposed* to be?
(My main fear, after seeing Imp. Games\' tentative schedule, is whether
they\'re trying to leap at the project in an equally overly ambitious way.
But that\'s the subject of a whole \'nother thread.)

The bottom line is: I *really* liked TNE a lot, but was driven away by
releases like Hiver & Ithklur (graphically an ugly, UGLY book as well, by
the way). To me (I realize others\' opinions will vary), I thought it - and
other latter releases - were just substandard.

Hmm, big red warning sign:

  N-space objects leave J-space unpredictably. There may be a generally
higher density of hydrogen along jump routes using this method, but
it would not be possible to trace a ship by them.

 I still prefer the original explanation, where the fuel is burned
all at once, and the regular power supplns the jump field integrity.


Ah hah! Since N-matter leaves J-space upon leaving the Jump field,
it would not be practical to maintain the jump field by pushing 
N-matter out into J-space...  It makes much more sense that the
jump grid must remain energized the entire time.

However it still bugs me that with all the other advances, a TL9
J-1 drive is exactly the same size and uses the same amount of fuel
as a TL15 J-1 drive.

Man-hours is probably best.  Remember Liberty ships?  Check the 
speed records in churning those out--but it was with the yards 
working all three shifts and extra workers and war-time  
mobilization. 
 
The Liberty Ships give us a clue how fast it *can* be done, if 
you have to.  Also, allow for advances in construction methods 
over the years and tech levels... How long does it take Lockheed- 
Martin to put together an external tank for the space shuttle?

Sure, if you catch them at it.

I was talking about publicly available information.  Remember
Rothchild used carrier pidgeons from harbor to his office to get
information a few hours before his competition.  That\'s smart, and
shouldn\'t be illegal.  

Take a different tack, let\'s say your scenerio about the government
contract is right, but instead of insider information you have 
enlightened speculation.  You, the smart trader, hire a team of sharp
investigators and analysts who advise you that the rumored contract is
about to blow up (or actually go through).  Based on their advice you
*speculate* in the Megacrop\'s stock...isn\'t that perfectly legal?  The
information *you* used was private, but it was gathered legally, and
you don\'t have a propriatary interest in the corp or a position in the
government, so what\'s wrong with that?

The point was not to follow the hydrogen trail but I stipulated that the hydrogen gave
of distinct radiation as it left J-space and entered N-space. By being in the vicinity 
a ship could pick up this radiation and track it. This way a ship in J-space going past 
an outer planet where a SDB lies could be detected by the radiation the hydrogen atoms 
produce as they enter N-space from J-space.

I\'m only speculating and at the same time developing a Jump theory that I want to use
for my alternate setting, the Terran Confederation (see my sig.). I use TNE and FFS and
want ships in J-space to be trackable even though the "tracker" didn\'t see the ships 
going into J-space (he could then have calculated the destination from the entry-vector).

I was think along the line of the jump drive using the liq.hyd. and because it was no 
longer useful just venting it out into J-space (where it wouldn\'t do any harm). A ship
that didn\'t want this would have to route the used hydrogen (now in gas form) into huge
tanks where I quess he could pressurerize it to liquid again. (not my field so I\'m just
theorizing. I then se a problem with what the JD wants with the liq.hyd. as all it does 
is heating it to gas form. The answer I quess is cooling.

As all it needs is to create a J-bubble and keep it up, why would a higher level
drive be any different. They could be, but shouldn\'t necceseraly be. Any explanation
works for me.

Unfortunately the PTRS , Steyr AMR, or the Barrett .50 cal sniper

<very> interesting variants on this round available.

Here they are:

#1
FRANCE (SFM)
The Societe Francaise de Munitions (SFM) manufactures a unique
piercing round known as PPI. This has a steel core fitted into a
self-tightening non-discarding sabot of brass. The hardened steel
makes no contact with the barrel, the brass sabot engaging with the
rifling; it has a special profile which reduces friction and this,
together with the lighter bullet, admits of a higher velocity than is
attainable with conventional AP bullets. In 12.7 x 99 mm calibre the
bullet weighs 47.82 g and has a V_25 of 890 m/s, with a penetration
of over 25 mm of armour steel at 300 m range and better than 13 mm at
1200 m range. The .50 PPI round is in current supply to the French Army.

#2
NETHERLANDS
Eurometaal manufactures the `API 2000\' cartridge with an improved
armour-piercing capability. It is ballistically identical to other .50
AP rounds and no modification to either weapons or sights is required.
It is also possible to mix it in belts with other types of ammunition.
There is no reduction in firing rate nor any increase of the normal
barrel wear. The API 2000 round will penetrate up to 40 mm RHA or
20 mm HHA plates at various angles and ranges. Post-armour effect is
significant.

Gotta love that dry Jane\'s Humour...\'Post-armour effect is
significant\' Probably whatever\'s on the other side of the armour is
swiss cheesed by fragments.

Raufoss A/S (RA) manufacture Multipurpose rounds with unique
advantages. The projectiles combine the properties of insensitive
incendiary and explosive charges. In addition to a significant
incendiary effect the projectile produces about 20 effective
fragments. Improved penetration is achieved by a heavy alloy core. The
combined effects of the projectile are effective against conventional
as well as sophisticated targets. Against helicopters the effect is
increased several times. Light armour (such as the BTR-60) can be
defeated at ranges in excess of 1000 m, while the general suppressive
effect against infantry, due to the flash, fragments and sound of the
explosion, is excellent.
  The good accuracy of the round makes the ammunition very suitable
for use in heavy sniping rifles. The exterior and interior ballistic
properties are equal to those of the US standard ammunition for the M2
heavy machine gun.

Hmmmmm...it would seem that effective AP rounds are available at
lower TL\'s, after all....:-> 

I can post (or e-mail) all the info if people want.

No, most of the blame was laid on the gold, or rather the distribution of the 
gold.

Although history class was a few years back (OK, ten) I do remember some of the 
particulars of the Spanish situation.  The problem was not the gold per se, but 
the distribution of it when it came home.  As you would expect, the crown got a 
good-sized pile of it (but less than they wanted) and the Church got a goodly 
amount oo.  However, the captains and troops/crews of the returning expeditions 
came home with a lot of gold.  No individual had a whole lot, but taken 
together it dwarfed the royal/church share.  The problem was, they came back 
with enough gold to live it up for a few years, but not enough to retire on.  
They would come home, celebrate (spend money) buy a new home (spend money) buy 
new clothes (spend money) etc.  The demand for things increased (good) but only 
in spurts as expeditions returned.  The increased demand also increased prices, 
but the demand did not last long enough to force an increase in production.  

The common folk (well, what passed for a middle class) soon found themselves 
being increasingly "priced out" of the market for luxuries and properties, and 
slipped into a more lower-class lifestyle.  As the buyers began to drop out, 
the merchants and tradesmen began to see their businesses fail and also dropped 
out, which basically eradicated the middle class.  BY the time anybody managed 
to figure this out, it was too late; easy sources of gold were now dried up, 
the royal taxes were shrunken away, and the treasury and other prominent 
expedition-backers could no longer fund new expeditions to find new sources of 
wealth.  The merchants and tradesmen whose tax revenues would have allowed the 
kingdom to thrive had gone out of business.  The royal treasury had been 
largely wasted on things like a fleet that didn\'t perform and attempts to annex 
other European stetes and colonies.

Kind of like the Seattle property value story somebody posted a few days back.  
Peopele came in and flooded the local market with money,a dn drove prices up.  
The newcomers stopped flowing in, but the prices remain high.  Soon, nobody can 
afford a new home, until the market readjusts itself.  But if the adjustment 
takes too long, all of the homebuilders will move away, making it that much 
more expensive to buy a new home.  A viscious circle.

I thought the whole Reformation Coalition storyline was being set up for a sort 
of Armada storyline, with the RC playing a rich but economically-screwed Spain 
and some other state (Terrans?) playing England.  When the Regency eventually 
showed up, the RC would have been knocked down in stature, and allowed the 
Regency to move in more easily.  Maybe the Regency could have played Napoleon 
and set up a puppet kingdom.  Of course, we all remember how that one turned 
out, so maybe not.

Very, very true...

Sounds reasonable.  

The question that comes to my mind now is, how far does the Imperium let 
this sort of stuff go?  I mean, they\'re pretty hands-off, but trade is 
their main concern.  Is it a total capitalistic society, where those who 
have special access (ie, being a member of senior management, or having 
enough money to buy information before it is made widely available) are 
allowed to use it to their advantage (and thus, to the disadvantage of 
others)?  

Or is the Imperium interested in at least attempting to create some 
semblance of a level playing field?

I think adventuring in a purely capitalistic environment would be 
interesting, to say the least. :)  But too it\'s too cyber-punkish for 
Traveller, IMO.

My supposition is that the Imperium treats economic matters similar to 
how it treats war between its\' member worlds: certain abuses are 
off-limits, but other than that, anything goes.  

Does this sound reasonable?  Has there been anything published which 
clarifies the issue?

If we\'re going to assume an Imperial Rules of Trade, does anyone have any 
ideas as to what the rules would be?

True, it\'s not.  I\'m just trying to figure out at what point the Imperium 
will draw the line as to what is and is not legal, given the 
communications lag.

Right.  And if you lived far away from civilization, and were only able 
to have your copies of the Wall Street Journal delivered once a month, 
while I lived in NY city and received it every morning, there would be 
nothing wrong with my acting on the information I received before you did.

But how will the Imperium treat this issue?

The issue I see is that some governments (and lots o\' not-so-wealthy people) 
take a dim view of those with wealth using the increased opportunities 
their wealth provides...to make more wealth.  Is the Imperium likely to 
agree with this?

I can tell you that MY Imperium wouldn\'t.  Free trade would rule the day 
every time.  

But the official Imperium?  I dunno.

Then there was that little thing called the Royal Navy, which along 
with inclement weather, broke Spain\'s naval power...don\'t forget that 
little thing called the Spanish Inquisition...which set back Spain\'s 
culture when Britain, France, and other European countries were 
entering the Age of Enlightenment...

1588 was a red letter date in European history...it was the last time 
anybody in Europe had a colonial empire without at least the tacit 
acceptance of Britain, until the late 19th century.  When Britain assumed 
control of the seas, Spain\'s days as a colonial empire...

Your comments on the gold are very enlightening Steve...

Problem is that there is 3600 years of culture in between and we see 
none of them.  There wouldn\'t be that many references to the culture 
of ONE nation, on a balkanized world, that frankly was a backwater 
world in the 20th century...

Last I remember, none of these happened 150 years ago.  Far longer in

what was happening a 150 years ago...

Questionable whether much of what you mention above is 
"Pop" or "Junk" Culture, in any case...If you think Shakespeare 
is junk culture, I may be gravely offended...especially since I acted 
in many of his plays... :-)

Gee, this is all true as far as it goes, but do people quote things from 
comic strips, that happened 25 years ago?  Not all that often...  That 
was my point.  How many people quote lines from Homer\'s the Iliad...  
which BTW, would be about 1200 years younger than the age difference 
between TNE & 20th Century Earth...

We are fortunate to drink from the well spring of 500 years of 
historical progress...made possible by the discovery of Greek, Latin 
and other texts from an earlier period.  There has been no cultural upheaval 
to rival the Dark Ages in 500+ years.  When the Dark Ages did happen, 
we lost a massive amount of information relative to what has been found from 
the eras of Rome, Greece, etc...

In the Traveller Universe, there have been 2 dark ages Since 2000 
AD...1 of them lasted about 1-1/2 times as long as the Dark Ages...  
The other was a destruction of civilization (Virus) so complete, that 
it would make the Vandals and Huns look like a few grade school 
toughs...

And yet we\'re supposed to believe that Calvin and Hobbes, and Monty 
Python made it through all this intact...  Never mind that the  
published works may never have come within 12 parsecs of the Old 
Expanses...

Exactly...Has anyone given any thought to the myriad of private x-boat

information I posted earlier.  He has been in the business for as long as I
can remember (almost).  He agreed with the numbers that I posted earlier,
but said they were more typrcal of a Barge than of a Ship.  You learn
something new every day.

So, discount all of what I posted earlier unless you are talking about a
barge.  Here is the breakdown for ships:
                
Retail Price:  100%
 Price Breakdown:
             Cost -  80% to 95%  (Avg: 85%)
  Profit/Overhead -  20% to  5%  (Avg: 15%)

   Cost Breakdown:
            Labor -  25% to 35%  (Avg: 30%)
         Material -  75% to 65%  (Avg: 70%)

Average Dollar value per Manhour:  $12.00 to $15.00 (Avg: $13.00)


    ******HELP!!!******


Using these numbers, I came to the conclusion that the Starships in
Traveller cost too much, or people don\'t make enough.  I than looked at the
100Td Scout and figured out how long it would take to construct one with the
World Tamers Economic Model.  I came up with a figure of 8.83 years for 100
workers.  This is an incredible amount of time.  I think the Starship costs
are broken!

I agree with you here!  I Think that using man hours to determine
construction times is the best approach.  In our shipyard, we usually spend
3,000 to 4,000 manhours on an ongoing project a week.  This number rises as
delivery gets closer, and lowers in the early stages of construction.  In
the case of a rush job (like the liberty ships) many more manhours would be
spent, but there comes a point where adding anothe laborer is
counterproductive because he just gets in the way.

Sorry, Cynthia, but I have to disagree here.  The advancement in
construction methods is going to be paralelled by the advancement in
material.  I think these factors would just about eliminate any advantage or
detriment provided by either advance.

That\'s my opinion of things Travelleresque.  It would be a monstrous job
to micro-manage trade within the Imperium.  IMHO, the Imperium would do
best to take the long shot on these matters.   They would have to prevent
the hugies (megacorps, etc.) from dominating the field, and at the same
time ensure that the small-time operations don\'t destroy the biggies.

As has been said before, the Imperium has neither the time nor the
resources to create a completely safe trade environment.  The Megacorps,
with their resources invested in a few fields would have far greater
capability to ensure the safety of their own tradeships, and the small
time players would have to be fast and SMART to survive.

I imagine a certain amount of pirate activity would be tolerated, perhaps
even endorsed (not publicly or directly, by any stretch of the
imagination) in order to keep the traders in check.  One must consider
that a huge trade megacorp has the potential to effectively supplant the
ruling power.  Something along the lines of: Gov\'t Official "We\'d like you
to lower your outrageous prices, or we\'ll break up your
monopoly"...Megacorp "Ha.  You remember the Long Night?  You wouldn\'t want
THAT to happen again, would you?"   The Imperium would have vastly greater
control over the bit players.

Well, obviously, anything that subverts the ideals of the Imperium would
be straight out.

If the Imperium rulers were smart, the would RESERVE alot of rights to
interfere/regulate trade, and exersize those every once in a while (very
publicly) so everyone is quite sure who the sheriff in town is, but other
than that, be pretty hands off.

It would make PC-traders much more interesting if they not only had to
avoid the dark side, but also avoid getting their heads publicly chopped
off by the Imperium for doing something "untoward".

I\'d say that line pretty much says that the worm is the corndog.  Jez, 
why don\'t they just ferment it in Mezcal and be done with it.

Yuck!  I\'ve never been one to place much trust in novels either, these 
though appear fairly accurate and they provide more information on a 
number of Coalition worlds than anything else we\'ve seen.  Useful, neat

Having just watched a program on the U-boat war in the atlantic the 
record for producing a Liberty ship is around 3.5 days.  The American 
ship yards were generally producing 40 or something like that a month.

If it works this way, with all the fuel consumed at once, why not include 
all your jump fuel in external collapsable bladders,  By the time the 
field is formed the fuel is consumed and the ships volume is exactly what 
it was before.  On a Midu Agasham this would give 10,500 cubic meters in 
which to place weapons, power plants, etc.

I still have a problem with the instantanious consumption of 10,500 cubic 
meters of hydrogen, well unless of course you simply explode it in place, 
if you\'ve got to feed it into an engine through constrictive valves this 
is completely impossible.

This I have to question you on.  You mean in DGP\'s "SOM", I\'ve never seen 
it, you activated the Jump Drive, established a Jump Feild then shut the 
sucker off?  Personally, if this is what it says it strikes me as 
strange, if the Drive is off it can\'t consume fuel and wouldn\'t need 
anykind of coolant thus upon activating a Jump Drive for a Jump 4 trip a 
Midu Agasham Class Destroyer consumes 10,500 cubic meters of fuel 
instantly???  Does this strike anyone else as strange?  Please clarify if 
I\'m missing something important here.

Personally, although Its a bit of creative licence I\'m sure, I like the 
idea of "jump fire."  It gives you something to stare at while in 
J-Space.

Many of you I\'m sure.  I\'m in the process of desiging a ship in FF&S 
using the basic layout of the ship on the cover of "Fighting Ships of the 
Shattered Imperium"  Its a modular component jobbie, A 10 ton detachable 
bridge section, basically a 10 ton shuttle and a 95 ton PAW engineering 
module.  At TL10 I\'m pretty cramped for weapon space so I placed 10 
magnetic slings on the exterior of the PAW module to support standard 0.5 
displacement ton missles.  

Now here\'s what I\'m wondering and how it relates to 2300.  A number of 
you have been designing HEPlaR Missles, with an incredible duration.  I 
want to know if sticking with 0.5 displacement tons if anyone has thought 
about magnetically slinging a pair of smaller warheads to the hull of an 
undersized missle with an extensive passive sensor array?  And having a 
single large warhead built into the missle.

With this system the missle acts both as a sensor drone, a missle and a 
sub-munitions delivery vehicle.  See the whole point is if you didn\'t 
want to waste a missle on the target you\'d simply let go of one of the 
sub-munitions alter the missles course slightly and detonate the 
munition.  The nuclear white-out would give the missle enough cover that 
it could excape the scene relatively unharmed.  By incorporating multiple 
warheads on the missle suddenly you never know what to expect.  Will it 
let you have it with all three, just one, or is is just passively 
scanning you.

If anyone has done work on this kind of system, please send me a copy.  
If this inspires anyone to make one of these beasties in FF&S please send 
it too.  I don\'t have time right now as I\'m in the process of developing 
four seperate starships for a pocket empire I\'m developing.

Here I agree if you don\'t trust your systems, or your systems are 
mechanical you really don\'t have anything to worry about.  Conversely if 
your computer\'s are tied into every aspect of your life, controlling 
everything that there is that surrounds you, you\'re screwed in the 
biggest sence of the word.  

Virus can\'t spontaniously cause a computer to grow an egg.  It has to be 
in contact with that computer somehow, either, physically, through phone 
lines, or via radio waves and Virus can only affect things with silicon 
components, if it doesn\'t have silicon you\'ve got nothing to worry about, 
unless it\'s contolled by a computer.

As far as the transponder is concerned.  Well I don\'t think that the 
Imp\'s would let you wire the thing in and if it\'s tampered with it\' 
starts screaming.  For 99.9% of the traffic this is not a problem, 
however for those of us engaged in extralegal activities we\'d be thinking 
twice about the alternatives.  Of course when the alternative is you 
can\'t land and repair at any legitimate Imperal facilities you\'d better 
have a good solid system of contacts already worked out and you\'d better 
bloody well know where every black port is in the sector.  Of course if 
you run into an Imperial ship, remember ships without transponders were 
routinely shot first and asked questions later.  The only people who 
didn\'t have transponders were the people who didn\'t want to get into any, 
"Imperial Entanglements."

See I don\'t think a hand computer would be safe.  The problem is, as long 
as you didn\'t attach it to any infected system\'s it\'d be safe.  THis is 
the same with modern computers, as long as you don\'t access unknown 
computers you\'re safe, but even accessing supposedly safe computers 
you\'re assuming that they\'re not interacting with unsafe computers.  It\'s 
kinda that, "when you sleep with someone not only are you sleeping with 
them you\'re sleeping with everyone they\'ve ever slept with," thing.  Sure 
you\'re being 100% safe, but is everyone else?  If it\'s got silicon in it 
it\'s suceptible to Viral infection.  It may never get infected, but you 
never know.

Anyway the Virus Safe computers of the Regency are actually already 
infected in the first place.  They\'re just infected with a domesticated 
strain of Virus that sit\'s there quietly waiting for another strain to 
enter the computer.

 One way of solving this problem is to make all ships (electronicly) carry
mail and news, much like the free-trader network in TNE (I think). OTOH,
undeveloped worlds with crappy starports and/or low tech levels might not
be able to read this news - but how many of them will have stock exchanges
that deal interstellar?

 Problems of people tampering with the news can probably be delt with by
use of public-key cryptography, but again this depends on a certain
minimum TL at the receiving end.

 OTOH, the Imperial government might be perfectly happy with the situation
above, and may even take advantage of it. After all, those type TJ
frontier transports have to have _something_ to do, and it\'s already been
noted that the Imperial family owns an awful lot of stock... I can easily
imagine a situation where the Imperium is partly funded by taking
advantage of secret government communications channels. OTOH, this
situation probably wouldn\'t last for long, as traders would soon notice
that the Imperial stock agent is phenomenally successful, and start
following hir leads...

Exactly!

How many pop-cultural references do we have lying around from 1600 BC?
What\'s left is mostly in the form of Myth and Legend, not people quoting
Euripides (which isn\'t even 3,600 years away)....

I remember a science fiction story of a future civilization (the remenants
of an After-The-Bomb type affair) worshiping the image of Micky Mouse,
because they had no connecting context to put it in. In that case, the
contemporary pop cultural referrence worked (for me, anyway - even though I
didn\'t much like the story).

Corn dogs and Python? Love \'em both. But I don\'t think they\'ll survive
4,000 years. The latter Traveller publications did. And a lot of other 20th
century Anglo-American institutions. It just broke down my suspension of
disbelief.

Along the same lines just 150 years ago chewing the fat from a cow or pig
was a popular snack...  By fat, I mean the stuff that nowadays would be used
for suet and fed to the chickadees as chickadee pudding. I don\'t remember
what the snack was called, the closest modern equivilent I can think of is
pork rinds.

The Gazelle uses ridged external tanks to give it better insystem 
preformence (more G-Turns) according to all the TNE write ups, I don\'t 
recall any of the Classis write ups.  The problem is that with the tanks 
attached the Gazelle\'s jump preformance degrades from a 5, bare hull, to 
a 3, external tanks.

>And if I recall correctley, even FFnS states it.

FF&S, having just looked at the page tells you how much fuel is required 
but doesn\'t say how the fuel is consumed.  TNE doesn\'t say much more, 
p224, "Starships tned to have large fuel capacities due to the need for 
coolant and jump discharge mass..."  Which doesn\'t tell us anything 
really.  Brilliant Lances, Technical Booklet p4 says, "Jump Drives 
require fuel, dispacement mass, and coolant, all of which are 
collectively called jump fuel (liquid hydrogen being used for all three 
functions)."  

None of these sources really tell us how much fuel is consumed during the 
initial formation of the jump-field.  However, two of them refer to 
coolant, if the jump-drive is simply turned off after the establishment 
of the jump-field why on earth would you need coolent?  My theory is that 
the jump-drive remains active thoughout the lenght of the jump, most 
of the fuel is consumed during the initial activation of the drive, but 
the active drive maintains the jump-fields integrity.

If this is not so the most economically viable thing to do with a 
Far-Trader would be to move all the jump-fuel to collapsable external 
bladders and convert the fuel tanks, 420 cubic meters, into cargo hold.  
Thus the ship would displace 230 tons upon activation of the drive and by 
the time the field was formed, because the collapsable tanks would be 
drawn back into the ships hull, it would only dispace the original 200.  
This way you maintain your original volume during transit in J-space but 
you gain an extra 420 cubic meters of cargo space.

Of course the ship would look something like a feeding humpback whale 
with these tanks full.

I figure on getting my third one from the local games retailer who I have

material.  After bugging him about it, I figure I\'d better give him some 
of my money. :)

I\'ve spoken to her (the receptionist/order taker) so many times she 
actually remembers my name, I\'m embarassed to say. [G]  More embarassing, 
I never asked her for her name...

Anyway, I recently placed yet another order, this time for membership the 
Citizens of the Imperium club.  I haven\'t been a member of a fan club 
since...well, since I joined the Atari VCS/2600 game machine\'s fan club 
in 80 or 81!  I feel kinda silly joining Citizens of the Imperium, but what

I\'ve found her to be thoughtful and courteous as well.  An excellent 
liason between IG and their customers.  I hope they realize what a great

Speaking as one James to another, I have to tell you that it\'s already
been done. Not by me but by Bertil Jonell, one of our very own TMLers.
He sent me an article back in 1991 that found its way into the 6th and
final issue of the Guildsman, an online & paper fanzine I was running
at the time. Since I\'m currently working on asciifying some of those
old articles, I figured I might as well send this one to the list.
Personally, I think it would have made a much better history than
the Virus, but that\'s just my opinion.

                  How the Imperium Really Fell

                  Copyright 1991 Bertil Jonell
                   d9bertil@dtek.chalmers.se

     Editor\'s Blurb:
     ----
     It all started late last year when Traveller players
     across the net heard an ugly rumor. The Imperium, GDW\'s
     extraordinarily comprehensive setting for the Traveller
     RPG, was going to fold because of a computer killing
     virus so that the gaming company could launch its new
     product, called "Traveller: The New Era", in a future,
     lower-tech extrapolation of the current and well-loved
     setting. Players, referees, and computer scientists
     alike were amazed, astonished, dumbfounded, and
     otherwise cranky about the news, not doubting GDW\'s
     willingness to smash it all (ala the assassination of
     Strephon) just to stir things up. Despite the injury,
     however, players seemed angrier over the affront to
     their intellect. "If they want to destroy the Imperium,
     why use a computer virus?" Why indeed? In his article,
     Bertil introduces a more creative and somewhat more
     believable explanation concerning how the Imperium
     really fell. We all hope that GDW will read it and use
     it!

It was 1116 on a cold planet in the Swordworlds. Emperor Strephon
and The Chairman of the High Council for the Zhodani Consulate
met in the utmost secrecy at the request of the Emperor. Two
years previously, the Consulate had sent a secret delegation to
Capitol/Core to inform the Emperor of the result of a test
several centuries in the planning.

In -7959, Imperial time, twenty years after their first orbital
flights, the Zhodanis mounted an expedition to their planet\'s
moon, Viepchakl. On the moon they found an extensive system of
underground tunnels dating back to the time of the Ancients. It
was still inhabited by Chirpers (regressed Droyne) similar to
those found on Zhdant itself. There were also a small number of
artifacts, among those a psionic booster. This was a device that
enhanced and focused the innate psionic power of teleporters so
that one person marginally skilled in teleportation could
teleport himself with full equipment or up to five other 
individuals (or warbots) over interplanetary distances.
Furthermore, the device automatically compensated for differences
in vector and potential energy between the two locations [1].

   Footnote #1: This artifact was the reason for the devastating
   plague that hit Zhdant after their first moon landings: the
   meeting between Viepchakl and Zhdant Chirpers (the latter
   members of the expedition) activated the tailored plague sown
   by the Ancients as a part of their final war. During its
   incubation time, it was brought down to Zhdant by humans and
   Chirpers testing the device. Even though they knew what the
   device did, the Viepchaklite Chirpers had lacked the technical
   skill to energize the device themselves before the Zhodani
   landed.
      When the first Chirpers began to die on the moon, it was
   already too late. The plague had spread to the Zhdant Chirper
   population and soon it targeted the humans on both Zhdant and
   the moon. All life on the moon was destroyed, and on Zhdant
   all Chirpers and 90% of the humans died. It took the Zhodanis
   nearly a thousand years to drag themselves out of the dark age
   resulting from the plague.

By 1114, however, in a manner similar to when the Imperium copied
the first black globe screen from artifacts found on Knorbes/
Spinward Marches, the Zhodani had succeeded in producing crude
but working copies of the teleportation enhancing device. The
Zhodani delegation to Core informed the Imperium of this highly
secret development. They assured that it would be used in the
case of an Imperial attack upon the Consulate or upon states
allied to the Consulate, and they asked the Emperor to scrap all
strategic fleet assets and only keep the anti-piracy detachments.
Their claims were proven in a demonstration where a volunteer
Zhodani and five warbot dummies teleported from a Zhodani cruiser
to an Imperial cruiser over Jewell/Spinward Marches while both
ships were engaged in heavy maneuvering at an interplanetary
distance from each other.

The Imperial High Command was terrified. Their age-old nightmare
of Zhodani commando warbots suddenly appearing in strategic
locations inside Imperial ships had come true. With just one
teleportation enhancer and a load of warbots, a lone Zhodani
teleporter could immobilize scores of frightfully expensive
Imperial ships.

For several centuries, both nations had been locked in a deadly
arms race, and with more area to protect and more enemies to
defend against, the bloated Empire was on the losing side. To
avoid alerting the Zhodani and other enemies that the Imperial
economy was on the verge of collapse, a policy was undertaken of
artificially inflating planetary GNP figures and underestimating
ship costs. Official figures claimed that the Imperium spent
around 1% of its total GNP for defense while the real figure was
actually closer to 60%. The Zhodani had penetrated the facade,
but it still fooled the Solomani, the Aslan, and the Vargr. While
creative accounting by IISS, the Department of Finance, the Navy,
and several Megacorps could hide the reality, it couldn\'t
overcome it.

Emperor Strephon immediately ordered that a countermeasure to the
Zhodani teleporters be found and installed on all Imperial
warships. Navy scientists informed him that a countermeasure
already existed: additional psionic shielding, but it was
ridiculously expensive. The already existent shielding in the
ships was one of the secret posts in the Navy budget. Repair and
maintenance of the frail and experimental electronics sucked up
immense amounts of money. Economists at the Imperial Department
of Finance then revealed to Strephon that the Imperial economy
simply couldn\'t handle the strain of equipping all or even the
most important ships with this new, expensive, and even more
frail and hard to maintain shielding.

Forced into a corner between the militant faction in the Imperial
Nobility led by Archduke Dulinor of Illelish ("The Zhodani will
attack us. It is just a matter of time. Any peace-treaty on their
part is a scam, so we must have this new shield") and the
economic realities of the situation, Strephon had no choice
except to start playing his trump cards.

The first was the Darrian Option. A sizable fraction of the
Corridor fleet was ordered to transfer to the Solomani Rim while
a similar number of ships in the Rim were transferred to
Corridor. This was officially called a "unit exchange maneuver".
In reality, however, the fleet that should of traveled rimward
traveled spinward towards the Darrian worlds in Spinward Marches,
gathering reserve units to boost its size along the way. Just
outside the Darrian border this combined fleet stopped in deep
space. A fleet courier continued on and delivered a message from
Emperor Strephon to the Darrians.

The message was an ultimatum. It asserted that unless the
Darrians attacked a long list of Zhodani systems with their
"Maghiz device" [2], elements of the Imperial Corridor Fleet
would sterilize all Darrian worlds with nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. The Darrian response was that unless certain
coded and outwardly normal messages continued to be transmitted
over the Imperial Xboat Network from Darrian to certain places in
the Imperium, preplaced Maghiz devices would be triggered on
several strategic locations in the Imperium.

The fleet left.

   Footnote #2: The Maghiz device, also known by non-Darrians as
   the Star Trigger is a semi-mythical weapon that can induce
   sub-nova flares in a star. These flares will travel outwards
   at the speed of light and destroy all types of electronics
   within twenty light-years in a manner similar to nuclear EMP.
   Its accidental discovery set the Darrians back two thousand
   years.

The second card was the Ultraviolet Option, an extension of the
old Project Blackheart. Several Imperial deep penetration fleet
intruders equipped with enormous deployable solar arrays would
enter the Consulate. They would use their solar arrays to charge
their jump drives. In conjunction with sporadic wilderness
refuelings on cometary nuclei, this would enable them to travel
deep into the Zhodani Consulate without ever straying close to a
system. Once at their planned locations, they would use the
element of surprise to bombard Zhdant and several other core
Zhodani worlds with nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
Hopefully, this would disrupt the Zhodani deployment of the
teleportation device long enough for the Imperium to invade and
crush the Zhodanis once and for all.

Just a few weeks after the five ships had departed, a new
delegation from the Consulate arrived at Regina bringing proof
that all five ships had been intercepted and destroyed before
even leaving the Spinward Marches sector. The Zhodani message can
be paraphrased as follows: "We expected about as much from you
untrustworthy Imperials, and we will overlook it. But try
something more, and we will be forced to invade and crush you for
our own protection."

Strephon had secretly been on Regina to direct first the Darrian
option and then the Ultraviolet option while avoiding the usual
time delays. He now requested an immediate summit. The location
agreed on was the Swordworlds, allied to the Zhodanis but almost
inside the Imperial sphere of influence. Emperor Strephon
traveled there to try to cut a deal not too unfavorable to the
Imperium, but at least one person in his entourage viewed this as
a capitulation and spilled the beans. Word about what was
happening spread with a jump 6+6 fleet courier across the Rift to
Illelish where Dulinor put in motion the plan he had prepared on
the off-chance that Strephon would "chicken-out".

During the negotiations on that small, cold planet in the
Swordworlds, Emperor Strephon tried every trick in the book. He
promised a removal of all Imperial laws banning psionics. He
promised a total demilitarization of Spinward Marches and Deneb.
He promised the return of the areas the Imperium captured from
the Swordworlds during the 5th Frontier War. He promised a
cut-off of Imperial military support to their tenuous allies, the
Darrians. He promised to open all Imperial military installations
to Zhodani inspection teams. All these things demanded by the
Zhodanis and refused by the Imperium in past negotiations. But
every promise was dependent upon the Zhodanis not deploying their
teleportation enhancer and that Imperial inspection teams would
be allowed to ascertain that the Zhodanis held their half of the
agreement. And the non-deployment of the teleportation enhancer
was the only issue upon which the Chairman refused to negotiate.

In the end, Strephon had to yield. The enhancers would be
deployed, but he managed to cut a much better deal for the
Imperium than the original Zhodani proposal would have been.
According to the final version of the agreement, the Imperium
would permanently give up all claims for any area spinward of its
current positions in the Marches, coreward of Deneb, and spinward
of the Windhorn rift. The size of the Imperial fleets would be
cut by 50%, and the Spinward Marches would be transformed into a
demilitarized zone.

However, while Strephon and the Chairman of the High Council of
the Zhodani Consulate signed the agreement, Archduke Dulinor
traveled towards Core to perform the now infamous coup. Strephon
got wind of the assassination when his ship was attacked in
Corridor on the way back. He diverted to his retreat position in
Gushemege to rally his forces and strike back. Meanwhile
Dulinor\'s coup had run into trouble.

Lucan, nephew of Strephon, third in line for the throne after the
Grand Princess and Varian, his own brother, had promised to help
back Dulinor by preparing incriminating evidence of Strephon\'s
"treason" in exchange for the position as Archduke of Deneb.
Dulinor\'s plan, as Lucan knew it, was that Dulinor would request
an audience with the "Emperor" [3], the Empress, and the Grand
Princess and then he would shoot them. The Illelish Guard would
then secure the throne room while Dulinor and Lucan presented the
"proof" that Lucan had prepared. Dulinor would then denounce
Strephon as a traitor to the Empire, assume the throne by Right
of Assassination, and declare war on the Zhodanis before they
could declare war on him.

   Footnote #3: Strephon maintained a secret policy of using an
   actor surgically altered to look and sound like him to cover
   for him when he didn\'t want his absence from Capitol/Core to
   be known.

Both co-conspirators had planned to double-cross each other from
the very start. Dulinor planned to have both Lucan and Varian
murdered after he had received the evidence, because as
legitimate heirs to the throne they would be threats. Lucan, also
aspiring for the throne, planned to have his brother Varian and
the real Strephon, returning from the Swordworlds, murdered. He
would then rally the Imperial Marine Guards to crush Dulinor
after the assassination of the "Emperor", the Empress, and the
Grand Princess. Lucan would thus emerge as both the legitimate
heir to the throne and the hero of the Imperium.

So while Dulinor shot and killed the "Emperor", the Empress, and
the Grand Princess in the throne room, one of his aides went to
fetch Lucan and the data-files containing the evidence. Lucan was
prepared for his arrival and had arranged it so that Varian would
be there at the same time. When the aide arrived, Lucan
personally shot him, Varian, a friend of Varian, and a Marine
guard stationed in Lucan\'s apartment. He then alerted the Palace
Marines that he had discovered a coup in progress.

When Lucan and the evidence failed to turn up, Dulinor\'s plan
fell apart, and he had to invent some other justification for the
assassination on the spot. The alerted guard units meant that his
own Illelish guard couldn\'t hope to secure the palace. Dulinor
was thus forced to leave the palace for Illelish to rally his
fleets. First he had to deal with Lucan. The war with the
Zhodanis would have to wait.

During the intense civil war that followed, both Lucan and
Dulinor squeezed every last quarter-credit out of every world
they could lay their hands on. They needed the money to prepare
their fleets for the expected Zhodani attack, an attack that
never came. When the Imperium fragmented, the Consulate decided
that the danger from the Imperium was gone for the foreseeable
future and sent a messenger to Archduke Norris of Deneb where
they told him that if he\'d feel like breaking the signed
agreement and fail to implement a DMZ in Spinward Marches, they
would have nothing against it since they wanted their flank
protected. But if he ever tried to move against the Consulate...

The Imperial Economy that had a hard time supporting the enormous
military spending normally, couldn\'t hope to survive the Civil
War. Military expenditures increased to over 80% of the GNP, an
insurmountable load for any economy. It broke down as the
Imperium fragmented. Lucan was hit least, because while he had
raised the secret taxes like everybody else except Norris, he had
left the actual economic management to the experts. Dulinor, on
the other hand, had tried to control every last credit with
disastrous results. Production everywhere fell through the floor,
and the navies started to cannibalize commercial shipping when
they couldn\'t afford to repair their frightfully expensive
warships.

The destruction of commercial shipping led to even lower
productivity, even lower tax income and a greater need to seize
commercial shipping and so forth. This fateful chain of events
continued until vast regions of space which had formerly been
part of the Third Imperium lay without naval protection and
outside the routes of the merchant lines. And this, gentle
reader, is the concise history of how the Imperium really fell.

Unless, of course, the Imperium guards the Xboat network like the US 
Government guards the US Postal Service.  Did you know it is illegal to send 
1st class mail through any other carrier?  You can send Priority-mail or 
Express-mail type stuff through another carrier...you can send parcels 
through another carrier...but something considered 1st Class-type mail 
MUST go through the post office.  Businesses have actually been 
fined, according to the _Mail: The Magazine of Communications 
Distribution_.  Amazing, is it not?

The Imperium might even more jealously guard the Xboat\'s market.  They 
might decide that a certain class of communications may only be delivered 
via Xboat to any worlds along the official Xboat routes.

Then again, the reasoning behind the US Post Office\'s sole claim to 1st 
Class mail traffic is that the cost of delivering mail to remote/rural 
areas is so great that if all 1st class mail did not go through the US 
Postal Service, a uniform price to all locations could not be maintained.
Since the Xboat doesn\'t go to all worlds, perhaps the Imperium has no 
reason to guard it as jealously.

Still, it\'s something to think about.

Agreed.  I think something along the lines of your reply to my other post 
(I\'ll reply to that in a minute, soon as I\'m done catching up with the 
rest of the List mail) would be best.  Not so loose as to evoke images of 
the Cyberpunk genre, but not so contrained as to choke the life out of

Only if the government is - relatively - laissez faire(sp?). To use a 
historical example, I don\'t think - um - Zil had much of a chance of 
supplanting the USSR gov. Or, for that matter, VolksWagen to supplant 
the Nazis. (Buying enough government officials so that they could do 
whatever they wanted, now, that\'s another matter. ;-)

In *my* Imperium, the Govt Official would then smile back and say, 
"Ha. You remember the Imperial Navy? You wouldn\'t want it to 
nationalize your assets, would you?" Or, if I were in a nastier mood, 
"Ha. You remember the Imperial Marines? You wouldn\'t want us to send 
a few companies of them to pick up the board, the major company 
officials and every major shareholder and dump them on Exile for 
treason, would you?" (Actually, the second option would probably be 
better, even for the corp. It would probably run a lot better once it 
got rid of it\'s top brass and their ridiculous perks. ;-)

In my book, threatening to destabilize the Imperium would be treason. 
Governments seldom tread lightly when dealing with treason. 
Especially not governments controlling *huge* fleets with lots of 
well-trained people just aching for a bit of clean, wholesome war. 
;-)

But, realistically, I doubt either side would let it get that far, 
there *is* a bit of a terror balance there. (Also, any Board that 
started a war with the government would get thrown (at .1c or more 
;-) out of the corp as soon as anyone could manage. Not much profit 
in a war. Unless you sell the weapons, that is. ;-)

True. But then, being smaller, they could also get away with more. Of 
course, a Big Corp that gets caught is far more likely to get away 
with a \'slap on the fingers\', while a small corp would most likely be 
destroyed.

Like threatening Imperial collapse. ;-)

Doing stuff that *obviously* hurt trade would probably be frowned on 
as well. (Like fixing the starport docking fees at ridiculously high 
levels for everyone but members of certain cartels, selling nukes (or 
relativistic rocks ;-) to the Ine Givar, etc.)

Right. They could most likely do a lot of it semi-covertly (everybody 
knows they\'re actually punishing a corp, but everybody can pretend 
it\'s just business as usual) with things like subsidies, research 
grants, granting or withholding major contracts, tax breaks/hikes, 
and, of course, actually *applying* laws that everybody mostly 
ignore. ;-)

For the Aslan, I\'m sure that clan based ship designators would be no
trouble----after all, they grow up in a very factionalized society.  I\'m
sure they would be expected to be able to recognize all sorts of clan
related designators at a very early age.

Maybe a law against interference with lawful trade?  This would include 
the obvious things like piracy, but also things like intimidating the 
purchaser into not buying what s/he wants to buy.

I\'m sure the costs listed in Traveller were never meant to stand up under 
the kind of scrutiny we\'re giving them.  But, it would be nice if 
Traveller had an economy that was more realistic.  I don\'t know how 
popular it would be with the gaming public in general, but I\'d like to 
see a supplement for Traveller that dealt with all of the economic issues 
raised on the lists - and more.  "Economics of the Imperium" or something 
like that.

Gaak.. How to find some traveller related to discuss this.. Unk.

Look, the defeat of the Spanish Armada was important in terms of its impact
on English history, and it was a big help for the Dutch Revolt, but I don\'t
think you can hang the whole collapse of the Spanish empire on it: If it was
that important, why did the process take 400 years?

As for British naval domination, that was really a product of the Napoleonic
Wars.  

There is a hell of a lot of political agenda in any British history touching
on Parliament or the Navy; both British agenda and American agenda; and I
think that that has warped a lot of our view of events like the Armada.

I agree that it makes a great history.  If the Imperium had to be

Gulf...

This really is on Topic, I will splain at the bottom.

The US forces in the Gulf may (I am not sure but would believe even w/o
facts) have been responsible for the largest number of "Friendly-Fire"
casualties, but there are two basic reasons for this.  One the vast
majority of the front line units involved in direct combat with the enemy
were US, and second the other units were not entirely integrated into US
tactics and doctrine, and many were using the same equipment as the
Iraqis.

As for why this is important from a Traveller POV, here we go.  An
effective military in modern times has the job of defeating the enemy by
whatever means necessary.  When involved in high intensity combat there
really are no rules, and you do whatever is required to win.  This means
using overwhelming force in an effort to induce your opponent to
surrender.  War is not boxing or football (US or European), and you do not
have to play fair.  The Imperial Marines have a rep of leveling their
opponents.  This rep means that they are rarely messed with. When they
show up, they mean business, and the kid gloves are off.  The US military
has a similar doctrine once high intensity conflict has begun.  Do
whatever you can to destroy the enemy as quickly as possible with the
minimum loss of friendly life.  One only has to look at the Air War in the
Gulf to see that this philosophy works.

You raised a great point about how in Traveller, there may not be a place
for fighters.  My main point is that in a game that wants to emphasize the
individual character, that fighters seem to be a great way to let
individuals decide the game.  Another point is that fighters are VERY
SMALL.  They should be much harder to hit as they are more maneuverable,
and harder to lock onto anyway.  Lastly Capital Ships really should not
easily be able to hurt little ships.  This has been the case for most
large ships throughout history.  Now can a  small ship hurt a large one? 
That has not always been a requirement, but it has been the case for a
while.  Fighters and other aircraft are hard to hit because they usually
move so much faster.  Traveller\'s problem is just like Wes said, the
Capital Ships can often move just as fast as the fighters.  Oh well.  

For Eris\' benefit, I will refrain from discussing how a fighter with BB
missiles could take out a Virus infected Silicon Asteroid moving at .1 C
towards the Carrier group I am designing.

OK, more clarification.  The Labor percent (Avg: 30%) includes Overhead
(Both Corporate and Yard), Engineering, and Actual Construction Crew.  Each
of these four divisions use about 7.5% of the labor cost.  This fixes the
problem I refered to in my last post.

Also, using the Starship Salary rates from the TNE main book, and
considering someone with skill level one as a laboror, and assuming the pay
listed would be 1/3 of someone not serving onboard a ship (with free room
and board) the average dollar value could be converted directly to credits.
I have the calculations if anyone is interested.  (It actually converts to
the low pay in the yard, and the higher skill levels would be payed higher.)

I\'ve figured out the problem.  Most of it came from the fact that Iwas using
the entire 30% for yard laborers working on the vessel rather than the
overhead, engineers and all.  Anyway, I came up with the following figures
for the standard ships in BL.

The Construction Time Column is for a single shift (48hrs/wk, 52wks/yr).
Add 2 Months of Engineering lead time at the beginning of the project.  Add
1/4 of the time for "sea trials" at the end of construction (More for
military vessels).

I\'m working on the rules system to explain Starship construction Costs and
Times, and I\'ll post it as soon as its done.

 Why would you say that?
 This was certinley not the case during the 1920s, which is about as close
to Traveller combat as we can get. Armored ships of the line with huge
main guns(in Traveller, missiles are generalley a secondary weapon). This
was also the same era that big battleships ruled the sea. Wooden warships
to a lesser extent(no armour) but that was still basicley the same deal.
 Modern warships are another story, but that\'s simply because most ships
today aren\'t even armored(Rember, modern waships are built with the
expectation of nuclear cruise missiles. Not enoufgh armor can be carried
to stop those...), and the ones that are armored can\'t be armoured enoufgh
to stop modern air-to-surface missiles or surface-to-surface missiles(they
would sink, duh<grin>)

 That\'s not true. In real life water ships, the drag goes up squared whiel
the volume goes up cubed. Hence, a larger ship can have a bigger engine
porportionatley to the drag produced on thie ship while still using less %
of the displacement then a smaller ship. The same is true for traveller
ships, as the larger ships can get the same armount of armour for less
displacement % of the ship.

Heh. Here in Sweden the (former state monopoly) Post Office *bought* 
it\'s main (and pretty much only) competitor after it\'s competitor was 
about to go bankrupt. It did this \'in order to maintain competition\'. 
See, if there was no competing company, then there would be no 
competition. Never mind if the Post Office owns it\'s main competitor.

Hmm. Now, I don\'t know enough to do this myself, but what happens if 
one factors in things like exchange rates due to TL differences? Or 
automation (presumably one could use the factors from SSDS?)

Take it a step farther. Consider the attitude of the Postal Service
towards UPS and Fed-Ex. They are attacking on several fronts:

1. it\'s *illegal* for anyone but a postman to put something in your
   mailbox. Also, the postal service controls the *design* of
   mailboxes.  If it isn\'t approved, they don\'t have to put mail in it.
   This results in a fair amount of inconvenience in delivering if you
   are competing with the Postal Service.

2. it\'s *illegal* to send materials via any sort of courier service
   unless they are *urgent. The USPS has started taking companies to
   court over this. They have to pay the USPS charges on any
   "non-urgent" mail sent via Fed-Ex or UPS. And guess who gets to
   determine "urgent"?

3. The USPS is *really* pushing the fact that their "overnight" service
   is cheaper than Fed-Ex and UPS, but they don\'t mention that that
   they do not *guarantee* delivery on time (or even at all!)

Given that the xboat service is run by a branch of the Imperial
government, I\'m willing to bet that they won\'t be any more open to
competition.

This leads to some interesting scenario possibilities.

So do I (in fact, I _know_ they didn\'t). What has that got to do with it?
There are lots of things that can only be properly understood in
retrospect. It\'s not what they thought that\'s important, but wether or
not they were wrong.

>Did the English and Dutch privateers who stole shiploads of gold do it
>to save the Spanish from themselves?  <g> Nah!  They did it because

Under a gold standard getting gold is good for the individual, but bad
for the economy. Think about why printing more money is bad: Say you
have 1,000,000 bank notes representing the total wealth of a society.
Now the government prints 250,000 more notes. Straightaway the other
notes are worth only 80% of what they once was. But the government gains
from it (in the short term, anyway); they\'ve suddenly acquired 20% of the 
wealth.

Now say you have 1,000,000 gold coins representing the total wealth of a
society. Now someone finds gold enough to mint 250,000 more coins. That\'s
a good thing for him, since he suddenly owns 20% of the total wealth. But
it\'s precisely the same effect as with the previous example. Everybody
else looses. There are only two differences: 1) With bank notes it is
much easier for a government to do this, since you can\'t do it under a
gold economy unless you find more gold; and 2) under a gold economy this
theft/"redistribution of property" happens _automatically_ if more gold
is found whereas with bank notes it takes a concious decision from someone
to do it.

The driving force for the time is a combination of the Book Price and
Displacement Tons.  I assumed (for simplicity) that all the ships prices
were listed at TL15 StarportA prices.  I would guess (although I don\'t know
for sure) that using the exchange tables this number would rise at any lower
combination.  As to automation, You could use it, and it would affect the
price, but not affect the number of bodies (warm blooded or mechanical) that
can actually _fit_ on the ship at one time.  BTW, I did fix the problem, and
posted another list for the std ships.

As a request, would the person or persons who developed the Yugo line of
starships please send a copy of the unadjusted price and displacement tons
of the vessels in this group.  I would think that these ships would be quick
builds, and want to check my "construction rules" against these ships.

Thanks!

July 13th.

Character Generation stuff:
1). during character generation, players will have the option of 
picking a a target age, and generating to that point.
2). Characters can automatically enlist if both relevant stats are at 
least 2 higher than the minimum required.
3). aging is done in 5 year blocks starting at 30
4). the INT+EDU limit on skills is gone
5). Career changes during Character generation are possible
6).  the Target # for skills will be STAT based, and the number of 
dice rolled will depend on the difficulty of the task
example: formidable task= 3D6 roll
7). new option for stat generation
A). roll 12 D6, place the dice as wanted

Combat stuff:
8). Leadership now has an effect on Initiative
9). there are no longer interrupts
10). Multiple actions are now possible depending on Dex, extra 
actions will affect the target numbers.
11). Combat goes back to the range band system
12). Ambushes last 1 round, then it goes to normal initiative

Yup.  :)  I\'m running into the same problem many others have...something 
you know and care about not being treated with the utmost realism, so you 
want to see it fixed.  It\'s the disease du jour of the Traveller mailing 
lists. :)

If we made Traveller as realistic as possible - meaning that there were 
no obvious holes in the setting, technology, etc. - would it still be fun?

OK, point taken, but it definitely was the high water mark for Spain. 
 After that time, they didn\'t add a whole heck of a lot to the 
empire, and their navy was never the same.  

I stand by my original statement.  Before the defeat of the Armada, 
Spain was THE preeminent naval power.  Afterwards, they were just 1 
amongst many.

Actually, Britain dominated the seas from about the 18th century on.  
Occasionally combinations of powers could interrupt this domination 
(Chesapeake Bay during the American Revolution for instance...), but 
British naval domination was a factor in other powers\' thinking long 
before the American Revolution...

I don\'t see anything I could disagree with here.  History is 
inevitably written by the victors, after all... :-)

I would anticipate a day when this may cease to be true about the 
USPS...  But I suspect that this will be true in the 3rd Imperium.  
Especially since an Imperial FedEx might offer Jump 6 service, and 
canon says that the Imperium has a vested interest in making sure 
that communications to the public stay at Jump 4...

  Ah, at long last, a version of the Imperial Collapse that makes the 
Virus look logical and straightforward.  Aside from the rather 
out-of-character actions by the Zho, as well as a version of how psionics 
works that would be out of place even in a Space Opera universe, this 
scenario makes the Imperium out to be a sad copy of the late-stage Soviet 
Union (economy in shambles, military spending out of control) and the 
Imperium\'s leaders out to be utter dolts (perhaps the one somewhat 
reasonable part of the narrative).  

  Well. it least it was good for a laugh - there just isn\'t enough humor 
in Traveller these days.

My main point, in my earlier post, was: Who distributes
news/information/mail/etc. to those backwater worlds that are not on
x-boat communications routes?  Would the Imperium have a few dinky ships
running an arbitrary schedule, or would they open those routes up to
private competition...?

political/military.

I\'ve a few alternative recommendations for folks to look at, for a 
different view.

George R.R. Martin: 

Dying of the Light, Tuf Voyaging, Sandkings, and Nightflyers (the later
three being anthologies).  Dying of the Light, and Tuf Voyaging, as well
as most of the stories in the later two books are set in a mileau which is
*remarkably* similar to the Imperium (mostly human dominated space
recovering form a prior collapse...).  Martin\'s culture\'s and worlds are 
very rich and imaginative.  Each world, and each culture is strange and 
wonderful.

Elucki Bes Shahar: 

Hellflower, Darktraders, and Archangel Blues:  These books are in a
setting which is almost *identical* to the Imperium, however, the plots
involve theft, trade, and intrigue more than war and politics.  Also,
culturally, (and in the details, technologically) this setting is very
different form the modern day, wonderful stuff). 

Joan Vinge:

Snowqueen, World\'s End, Summerqueen:  Wonderful books in a setting which 
has some similarities to the Imperium, and would be great to borrow from. 
Once again, the level of rich detail is wonderful.

Enjoy!

There was a rule for drop tanks for jump fuel, I believe it
was a book5 rule. And the description wasn\'t that the consumption
rate was instantaneous, but that the jump capacitors had to
be charged in a certain period of time, which was beyond the
capacity of standard Fusion reactors.  Pretty hokey, but it
was the explanation used. Of course the J-drives were using most of
the fuel for cooling, I always wondered "Why not just carry
water tanks for all of this cooling? after all- it is MUCH
cheaper than pure H2 per Kg."  The same goes of course for maintaining
a Jump bubble with it. It is quite elementary to keep the water
in seperate tanks. And it can absorb a lot more heat than H2.

	Uhhh...and people say they have  trouble suspending their disbelief 
regarding VIRUS! 60% of the Imperial GNP going to support the naval 
fleets, and no one catches on...Riiiight! Doomsday weapons everywhere, 
and no one has a clue, and NONE of them get used during the black war 
...Riiiight! 

	With their teleportation system, the Zhodani don\'t have to
negotiate with anyone.  Imperial ships just start blowing up whenever they
get close to the Zhodani sphere. Why waste a warbot, when a TacNuke will
do just as well? The isolationist policies of the Zho\'s, as laid out in
the Rebellion Sourcebook, would guarantee that the Zhodani would not
threaten the Imperium unless there was a buildup on the Zhodani border,
and since the Fifth Frontier war cooled off, there hasn\'t been. 

	If 60% of the Imperial GNP is going to maintaining and building 
the fleet, I\'d think that the Solomani and Aslan MIGHT have noticed the 
build-up, just a little bit. To do this, no matter HOW the Imperium cooks 
it\'s books, it\'s gotta be taxing everyone at nearly 100% levels; we 
\'Murricans whine and piss about a lousy 4% added gas tax. I can just 
imagine what the actual economy looks like at these kind of rates. 
Inflation will be running at double, perhaps even triple digits...since 
the only way for the Imperium to raise that kind of money, while hiding 
it, is the old-fashioned way...they gotta print it, by the ton.

	Strephon is so stupid, that he threatens the Darrians.  That\'s 
like walking up to someone in a tank, with the main gun pointed at you, 
aiming a .38 at it and saying \'You\'ld better do what I want, or I\'ll 
shoot you!\'

        Sorry to be so sarcastic, but after the ViralFlames, people are 
going to have to expect that non-Virus explanations of the collapse will 
be examined for rigorous adherence to reality, since, essentially, that 
is the main point of the Anti-Virus argument.

	If you don\'t like Virus that much, all you have to do is extend
the rebellion a few more years. Even in TNE, they very carefully say that
Virus did not cause the Collapse, merely hastened it along; the Rebellion
had started the inevitable slide into darkness all by itself. Once
sufficient civilian manufacturing and trade assets have been destroyed,
interstellar trade becomes absolutely economically infeasable.

	All those high-tech low-survivability worlds crumbled (you know,
those Atmoshere 0 through 4 worlds, the tainted atmospheres, the asteroid
belts with millions or billions of people living on them) when the spare
parts ran out, and Joe the airlock parts salesman no longer made calls to
your part of the universe, and everyone dies gasping for breath.

	All those high tech survivable worlds collapsed when they realized
that you need more than factories to support a 9 or A Pop, you need food,
and Joe the food distributor no longer makes calls to your part of the
universe, and 70-90% of your population starves to death or is killed in
the food wars before you learn how to farm again. 

	All those low tech survivable worlds collapsed when they were
overrun by the giant shiploads of refugees from the above worlds, and you
had the choice of letting them land, or shooting them out of the sky, so
that you and your children might live (and sleeping with your nightmares
at night).

	TNE is not a \'Dark Future\' game...MT was. In TNE you actually 
have the chance of rebuilding. T4, I hope, is equally optomistic. A game 
of expanding horizons and and a glorious future, instaed of one of war 
and destruction. 

	What I\'d really like to see in Mileu 0 is a big de-emphasis on 
weaponry and a bigger emphasis on exploration. The Long Night has been 
going on for a thousand years, and the Syleans haven\'t a clue of what 
they\'ll find...star-spanning empires, wierd cultures, new aliens...why 
fight when exploration can be so much fun?

Thanks for posting this! :)

And now, on to comments:

Hmmm.  I assume this means the target age is picked prior to character 
generation, then once that age is reached, whether the career is going 
great guns or not, the character musters out.  Hmm.  Not bad.

Oh boy, D&D-like pre-requisites.

Wonder what the reason for this change was.

> 4). the INT+EDU limit on skills is gone

Hmmm.  No limit to the number of skills a character can have, eh?  Well, 
no artificial limit.  There\'s still the usual limits (what can be gained 
during generation, and (presumably) what can be gained in the adventuring 
career).  I like this change....though it was never something that 
bothered me.

> 5). Career changes during Character generation are possible

Realistic.  Another AD&D staple, the multi-classed character.  
Nonetheless, it\'s a reasonable change.

YAY!  This is a GREAT change.  I like this a LOT.

What about 3D6, discard the lowest?  :)

This is something I liked about the Hero System...I\'m glad they added it.

Doesn\'t bother me....might bother others, though. :)

> 12). Ambushes last 1 round, then it goes to normal initiative

Hmmm.  I assume there\'s some way to keep the initiative.  That is, to 
keep the enemy reacting instead of acting...or make it harder for them to 
act.  Something like that.

yeah, you wouldn\'t want the "little people" having access to all the

I believe I remeber it being stated somewhere in the literature that 
communications service to worlds off the xboat routes is handled by the 
subsidized merchants....but I could be mis-remembering.

    'body' => 'At work (US National Archives, Alaska Regional Officer), we are constantly
loaning or recieving documents. Over half of our routine office support
(payroll, etc) is sent via UPS to St. Louis from anchorage AK. Almost all
loans go out via US Snail to other government agencies, but come back via
FedEx or UPS. Most loans are in the 1-3 Cubic Foot range; Large loans (10+
cu ft.) are picked up by the agency at our front door, and returned the
same way, using the other agencies personel. In three months there I have
seen daily loan returns from FedEx; I have seen two returns via USPS, and 4
returns  via UPS. Even with "free" government USPS service (we don\'t take
USPS out of our local or agency budgets, according to the boss), we still
send 3-10 pcs via FedEx per week, and recieve 1-3 pcs per day via FedEx.
Most from within state. (Most of our outgoing FedEx is to DC or St Louis
MO.)

Why? Guaranteed delivery, and time critical materials (paperwork); loans
are sent back via FedEx because of Guarnteed delivery, maximization of loan
useage time, and accountability.

This kind of situation will probably exist in the Imperium, as well, as
each planet has local mail services; Each subsector will have routes that
will accept mail and GUARANTEE delivery (for a charge), and most agencies
will either have internal mail handling ala the US Navy, or will use the
most effective means for critical materials.

Also, mail (as opposed to letters and data), is handled by contractors (cf:
CT, MT) who are mostly indepenant or subsidized merchantmen, at 5 times the
cargo rates.

2) The idea that stats get you in automatically doesn\'t bother me.
3) 5 year terms makes things a little less anthropocentric.
4) INT+EDU limit gone.  Good, never used it myself.
5) Changeing careers is possible.  Good, but I hope it doesn\'t lead to 
munchkinizing like in TNE, where if you changed careers constantly you 
could make "super character".
6) Where do skills factor into the task system?
7) Hmm, very AD&D-esque, but okay...

Regarding the combat stuff, everything seems fine except the range bands 
thing.  I _really_ think this is a bad idea.  I don\'t know why they 
decided on this, but I don\'t like it.  I guess it\'s easy enough to make 
your own movement systems, but I think this whole idea is bad for the 
game\'s popularity.  It\'s too unrealistic.

the external fuel is used to get more G-turns (since that\'s the major
limiting factor), while in CT/MT it is used mainly for increasing jump
range and actually reduces the G performance for the craft.  One could 
have external tanks for either purpose in either game, but they\'re most 
useful for maneuvering in TNE and jumping in CT/MT.

Don\'t know if this last part is realistic, though.  Could they get oxygen

...something about Starships consuming all the jump fuel on the
instant of jump...

>>This is cannon, 

How I hate that term! 

But if you must use it, use it correctly!  A cannon is a large mounted
piece of artillery.  Canon is a law or body of laws...generally of a
church.  The Church of Traveller?  <G>

Now back to Jump Theory....the following is not CANON, it is ERIS! <g>

=================================================================

                    How Jump Drives Work

Jump Drives have two separate components, the Jump Coil and the Jump
Grid.  Both are required for a ship to complete a jump.

The Jump Coil is a large device located somewhere inside the ship.  It
rips an opening between normal space and jump space large enough for a
ship to enter.  The opening persists for less than a minute.  Creating
an opening is an electro-mechanical action that requires a huge amount
of energy in the form of electricity.  Even so this uses only a small
portion of the fuel a ship carries.  Capacitors (or other storage
mechanisms) are often used to build up the required charge needed to
energize the Coil.  Preparing for a jump normally takes several
minutes while the capacitors are charged, the Coil is set in the
correct configuration, and the engineers make sure the electrical and
mechanical components are all working correctly.  Once a ship has
entered jump space the Coil is shut down, cooled and often serviced by
the engineering staff.

The Jump Grid is built into the ship\'s hull.  Its purpose is to
maintain a barrier between jump space and normal space.  This barrier
is required because, as you know, humans (and all known aliens) suffer
madness and death if exposed directly to the effects of jump space.
The Grid is energized before a ship enters jump space, exhibiting the
trademark violet and blue shifting patterns as the ship moves into the
opening into jump space.  The Grid runs continuously while a ship is
in jump space.  The Grid uses a substantial portion of the fuel a ship
carries.  Loss or reduction of power to the Grid is very dangerous,
and its function should be continuously monitored.  Most ships are
built so that the Grid overlaps to compensate for hull or Grid damage.
As you would expect, warships incorporate much more overlap than
civilian ships.

                   Why a Starship Needs Coolant

Starships produce huge amounts of energy as they travel through space.
Most of this energy eventually turns into internal heat that must be
removed to keep the internal temperature at acceptable levels.  Ships
generally regulate internal heat by circulating coolant through large
radiators.  A good deal of this coolant is inevitably vented into
space. Ships in jump space continue to produce heat internally, and
while in jump space they must continue with heat regulation.  In jump
space, as in normal space, the most effective method for cooling the
ship is venting heated coolant.

=================================================================

Like I say above, this is ERIS, ie. it\'s the way I do things.  If you
belong to a different church, feel free to do things differently. <g>

1) The Imperium would allow private and competitive message carriers (in
fact they already do effectively, since private merchants can presumably
carry info as cargo), but would not allow them to have greater than jump-4
ships.  They at least would keep J5+ ships tightly controlled.  This would
maintain their monopoly on rapid message transport. 

2) Messages to worlds not on x-boat routes could be handled by three 
different sorts of carriers: private (FedEx, UPS, etc.), independent 
(Subsidized merchants with the ever-popular mail contracts.), or local 
government vessels of myriad configurations.  

3) An interesting business opportunity might be cut-rate but relatively
slow/unreliable transport of messages by non-subsidized merchants or
private craft just passing through in the right direction.  Basically, the
Haphazzard Message Company would pay people 250 Cr a ton to transport
letters and stuff in their spare space.  Merchants would only carry such 
parcels to fill a few leftover tons of cargo bay space, while scouts, yachts 
and so on could use this to make a little side cash with their tiny cargo 
bays.

Human nature, Hans, human nature.  Given similar circumstances people
will react similarly.  As a rule, we don\'t learn much or easily from
our mistakes, and sometimes the lessons we learn are wrong.

And cultural differences can change what *you* think is right and
wrong from what *I* think is right and wrong.  Even about the same
historical event, even if we have the exact same references and
sources.

History is NOT immutable!  A specific culture\'s experiences color
their understanding of events, including past events.  Anything
historical, beyond basic facts (and even then more often than you\'d
suspect), is always an interpretation.  And as, over time, a culture\'s
basic memes change it will re-evaluate the past to reflect its *new*
beliefs.

I agree....how about, "it\'s in the literature" or something like that.  
Not as elegant, but it doesn\'t give the impression of perfection, divine 
inspiration, and inflexibility that "canon" does.  Any other ideas?

I belong to the church of "Use What Works," and this fits with the 
doctrine thereof. :)  In other words, thanks for posting it.  That\'s the 
best explanation of the jump process I\'ve come across.  Very usable, and 
gives the players who choose an engineering character an idea of what 
sort of things their character might be doing just prior to and during a 
jump.  Plus, the stuff in there about the jump grid and possible 
damage effects gives me something to torture the players with out in deep 
space after a particulary nasty battle.  "What do you mean we can\'t 
jump?  Our drives never took a hit!"  "Ah, but you do remember the 30 
holes that opened in your hull during that barrage, don\'t you?" :)

I support the TNE Virus (yes, it does require a suspension of disbelief) but
this I found a bit weird.  I mean how did he know that the mother ship (and
a mother of a ship it was) was going to execute that stuff he uploaded?  And
how did he know what their programming language was?  I\'d\'ve bought it
except for the line by Data...um, I mean the Area 51 chief scientist about
how none of the systems had been operable until the aliens arrived!!  BTW,

This is a bit of an exaggeration.  Particularly since a miniatures

I can live with a range band system.  I\'m not super excited about it, 
but I can deal with it.

I didn\'t say I like it, but even according to CT, it is canon, but remember 
there is no x-boat system until after the Civil War...so I suspect it will be

Sure!  There would be difficulties, but given a normal system and a
good starting level of technology, population, knowledge/skills, and
avoiding major upsets (war would be a big one) a space civilization is
very viable.

You don\'t even need gas giants, just run of the mill asteroids and
comets.  Split water for hydroden and oxygen.  There\'s everything else
you need in rocks and frozen gases.  Heavy metals are available from
certain classes of asteroids too.

Quite so!  More than enough energy is available from the local star. 
And you don\'t even need soil, aeroponics and hydroponics works just
fine.  

You could sustain a viable civilization at a lower level of technology
than you might think.  You don\'t *have* to have gravtics or even
fusion.  You do have to have access to minerals, energy, and the tools
to produce the things you need.

Thank you, Sir! <g>

Absolutely.  <g> I have a whole set of procedures for the engineering
types to go through preparing for and during a jump.  I didn\'t post
any of my Astrogation or Piloting stuff (it relates to Jump, but not
really to fuel use and that\'s what was being discussed), but I have
task lists for them too.

You got it!  <g> I\'d still let them jump, but they\'d better get to
work on that grid or they might be mad as hatters when they arrive in
the next system...if they arrive at all.  

There was one game where the PC\'s were forced to huddle together in a
couple of compartments for the entire jump.  They left only to make
quick runs to the bridge or engineering to check on things...and
suffered various hallucinations when they did.  None of the PC\'s
actually died that time, but one NPC did committed sucide, cycled
himself through the airlock into jump space, buck naked, screaming
something about bugs.  <g>

There\'s also the possibliity of sabotage or accident during the jump
leading to emergenecy responses and repair tasks.  Or a ship can lose
coolent or have compenents running hot, and have cooling problems. You
have to find some way to reduce the heat or you\'ll have roasted
travellers.  <g> I don\'t usually *focus* on in-jump sessions, but
having all these possibilites is quite useful.

I\'ve only finished the first book, "Mathmematician," and I\'m curious if

Second, how does the Foundation universe compare and relate to the Traveller

Methods of Construction

Typically there are three methods of construction in shipyards within the
Imperium: Frame Construction, Hull Construction, and Modular Construction.
While each of these types of construction affords certain benefits for
different construction facilities, perhaps the most popular is the Modular
Construction Method.

Frame Construction:  A shipyard using the Frame Construction method
generally will begin construction with the creation of the internal
structure and framing of a starship.  After the basic frame structure is
created, the various components are added in place, and where necessary
floor, wall, and ceiling plates are installed.  When all, or the majority,
of the components are added, they are all connected and the remaining floor,
wall, and ceiling plates are installed.  Finally, the hull is added to the
outside of the structure, and any external components are added.  This
method of construction is particularly useful in the construction of open
frame hulls, small hulls, and hulls with few exterior components.

Hull Construction:  The Hull Construction method is typically used with
military and other government hulls (*1), odd hull configurations, and hulls
with specialized internal designs.  The basic process in this type of
construction is to start with the basic structure of the hull, and add the
internal structure and components as necessary.  With the aid of
anti-gravity technology, the actual hull is held in place until the
appropriate internal structure and armor plating can be added.  Once the
internal structure and additional armor are added, the internal plating
(floor, wall, and ceiling) and the components are added.  Finally the
components are connected and initialized.

        *1 - Typically only military and government hulls that will require the
             installation of components that have been developed secretly for
             the government.

Modular Construction:  Modular Construction is used profitably for any type
of hull, but extremely reduces the cost of standardized hulls.  In Modular
Construction, the base of the hull is laid out, and modules are added as the
hull is built up.  For example, in a simple design, the bottom of the hull
would be manufactured, and teh engineering modules would be added to the
bottom deck, then as the fore and aft hull was being added on, the second
level floor would be added, and on top of it, the quarters modules.
Finally, the hull would be sealed, the components would be connected, and
the hull delivered.  While it is typical for the hull to be created from the
bottom to the top, it is not necessary that it begin with the bottom.  In
fact, some shipyards will only begin a modular construction from the aft.


CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

Welders:  The welder is the worker who adds the final securing to the hull
and internal structure.  After a fitter (see below) has placed the building
materials where they belong, the welder comes in and attaches these
materials with a permanent weld.

Fitters:  Fitters are responsible to place the plate, angle, channel, and
other structural and hull material in the proper place.  Typically the
fitter will secure these pieces with a few plasma welds until the welding
crew comes to finish the welding and secure th peice in place.

Electricians:  Electricians are responsible for running the electrical
cables throughout the ship.  These cables provide both power and data
transfer to and from the systems of the ship.  In addition, the electricians
are responsible for installing the electrical components onboard the ship.

Gravtics:  The gravtic crew is responsible for installing the gravity
systems (both contra gravity lifters and ship gravity) on board the ship
and, in some cases, the maneuver drive.  This crew is also responsible for
connecting these systems to the power and data cables provided by the
electricians.

Engineers:  The engineering crew is responsible for installing and
connecting the remaining systems.  This includes jump drive, power plant,
life support, quarters, hanger, and, on civillian ships, weapons.

Weapons specialists:  On military ships, this crew is responsible for
installing and connecting the weapon system.

Painters:  This crew is responsible for coating the hull (interior and
exterior) with the appropriate color shceme as well as the proper protective
paints.

Material Handlers:  This is the crew that actually gets the material from
its location in storage to the place wher the installation crew needs it.

Foremen:  These are the supervisors.  There are two groups in this heading,
the job foremen and the yard foremen.  The job foremen are assigned to each
hull and responsible for coordinating the construction from start to finish.
The yard are usually assigned to multiple hulls at once and are responsible
for overseeing the various crews in the yard (ie, welding foreman, fitting
foreman).

Laborers:  This crew is assigned as needed to assist the other crews.  Their
responsibility varies from getting welding material to unloading material to
mixing paint.  Typically this crew is responsible for the final clean up on
board a vessel before trials begin.

Architects:  This is the crew that actually designs the ship based on the
customers specifications.  They are responsible for determining the best
system to fit the customers requirements as well as designing the location
of equipment within the customers guidelines.  This crew provides the yard
with the blueprints with which they construct the hull.  This group also
include the specialists who help the customer determine what will work and
what will not work.

Office Employees:  This group includes the purchasing, accounting,
personnel, and management departments.  Also included in this group is the
sales and marketing staff as well as company laywers and project management.


CONSTRUCTION PRICES

Price:  The price listed for starships in most packages is the actual final
price for the vessel.  Typically shipyards will offer a ten percent (10%)
discount for customers willing to use standardized products rather than
specialized equipment.  Many shipyards have also implemented a standard
practice of allowing a twenty-five percent (25%) discount for ships built
using "off-the-shelf" components, that is components that are either in the
shipyard inventory or standard items available within weeks from a vendor.

Cost:  The cost of a starship typically runs between 80% to 95% (Avg: 85%)
of the actual sale price with 25% to 35% (Avg: 30%) for labor and overhead,
and 75% to 65% (Avg: 70%) for materials.  The 30% average for labor is
typically divided evenly between actual yard workers, designer/architect,
yard office, and corporate overhead (each getting 7.5%).  Here is a simple
breakdown of the starship cost:

     Cost Breakdown:
             Labor                      
                         Job Labor -  7.5%
                  Design/Architect -  7.5%
                     Yard Overhead -  7.5%
                Corporate Overhead -  7.5%
             Total Labot                        30%
             Material                           70%
                                              ----
             Total Cost                        100%


CONSTRUCTION TIME

In a typical shipyard, working 48 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, operating
only one shift, the construction time for a starship can be calculated using
the following formula:

        Tc = (.208 * P)/(D^0.5)

        Where:  Tc = Construction Time in Years
                 D = Displacement Tons
                 P = Price in MCr

To this figure, add .16 years for typical design time.  For civillian ships,
typical trials time will be twice the displacement divided by one hundred
months.  Military ships use the same formula only using four times the
displacement.  The formula for the number to add to construction time is:

        Tt = ((F * D)/100)/12

        Where:  Tt = Trials time in years
                 F = Multiple factor (2 for Civillian, 4 for Military)
                 D = Displacement Tons

The final time from contract signing to delivery of a starship would be:

        T = .16 + Tc + Tt

        Where:   T = Total time in years (contract to delivery)
                Tc = Construction time in years
                Tt = Trials time in years

These formula assume a single shift 48 hour work week and an average pay of
13Cr per hour in the yard.  It also assumes a 52 week per year schedule.  If
additional shifts are added (up to three shifts), simply divide the Tc
(Construction time) number by the number of shifts used.  Trials and Design
are not effected by additional shifts.

If any of the other factors are changed (ie, hours/work week, weeks/year, or
average hourly rate), the formula will not work.  As these are the averages,
this will be the typical time throughout the Imperium; however, if any of
these norms change, the following extended method can be used to determine
the construction time:

Step            Action                                  Result

 1.             Multiply 90% (or cost percent) by 
                 7.5% (or labor cost percentage) to
                 determine Job direct labor cost 
                 factor.                                Labor Cost Factor

 3.             Divide Labor cost factor by 1,000,000
                 then again divide by 13 (or average 
                 yard hourly rate) to determine man-
                 hour factor.                           Man-Hour Factor

 4.             Divide man-hour factor by 48 (or
                 number of hours worked per week) to
                 determine man-week factor.             Man-Week Factor

 5.             Divide man-week factor by 52 (or
                 number of weeks worked per year) to
                 determine man-year factor.             Man-Year Factor

             This number is:  the number of years it would take one man, or
                              the number of men it would take one year
                to build the ship, and must be adjusted based on the number of
                workers able to work on the ship at one time.

 6.             Determine the square root of the
                 displacement tons.                     Crew Factor

 7.             Multiply crew factor by 10 to
                 determine the maximum crew able to
                 work on the ship at one time.          Max Crew

             The initial formula for Construction Time is the Price of the
ship times the man-year factor divided by the max crew.  Again this is for
one shift, for more shifts divide the construction time by the number of shifts.

If you\'re using most of the fuel for cooling purposes why is it 
disapearing?

In theory you\'d think that the imperium would run the cooling system on a 
closed circut much like the cooling system on an internal combustion 
engine.  Liquid Hyrdogen is extremely cold and would make an excellent 
heat dispursur, if you pumped the hydrogen through a cooling jacket on 
the exterior of the jump-drive and through specially designed cavities in 
the center of the jump-drive you\'d be more than capable of cooling the 
drive.  As the hydrogen heated it\'d turn in to a gas, the gas is then 
collected pumped through radiators, re-compressed and used again, if the 
entire system was highly pressurized it\'d never even turn into a gas.

The problem with this theory is any moisture in the atmosphere, inside 
the ship, would freeze to the outside of the jumpdrive.  This could 
become pretty messy.

Really?  You\'re lucky, my store up here in Canada knows nothing about T4, 
he\'s on his suppliers butts night and day, because I\'m on his butt night 
and day.  I\'ve told him more than his suppliers have and half of them are 
in the States.  None of the suppliers know what\'s going on, in fact he 
was worried it\'d be an internet available game only.

You bet!  I grew up on RC cola and Yahoos, got sick on (and of) moon

But there was nothing better than salted peanuts in a bottle of ice
cold coke!  You pulled the cokes right out of the water in the big red
ice cooler at Rex\'s General Store.  You could tell it was a coke just
by the feel of that curvey little bottle.  Pop off the bottle top on
the side of the cooler, tear open the bag of roasted peanuts, and pour
\'em in...Ahhhh!

      My main point, in my earlier post, was: Who distributes
news/information/mail/etc. to those backwater worlds that are not on
x-boat communications routes?  Would the Imperium have a few dinky ships
running an arbitrary schedule, or would they open those routes up to
private competition...?

I think that\'s what those subsidized merchants are for. They will =
establish a route for those backwater planets where they are the only =
starships to make regular runs. If those planets can\'t afford to =
subsidize a merchant, they might subsidize a lone scout for mail =
running. I think Imperium doesn\'t care for communication to those =
planets which doesn\'t attract trade.

Depressing. If the canadians dont see the fliers, what chance will us 
Aussies have?

Maybe you should contact IG yourself, see if the Commonwealth Countries 
are on the list. If not, we may have to go to war again with the Yanks :-)

At least you are reading it. I am eternally greatfull for Mr Mcdonald

The Imperium was formed after the collapse of the spacer worlds (see 
Robot Series), and the distruction of Earth. Many small states competed 
for dominance, in the end Trantor came out on top. In the end, The 
Imperium started to collapse. Hari Seldon, a mathematician , postulated 
that you could use equations to map history (sort of chaos theroy with 
masses of people). He realised that the collapse of Trantor would lead to 
an Interigum of 10,000 years. If he took steps , the piriod would be 1000 
years. So he formed the Foundations, who where to herald the new 
civilisan.

The easiest way to read it:

1. Foundation
2. Foundation and Empire
3. Second Foundation
4. Foundation\'s Edge
5. Foundation and Earth.
6. Prelude to Foundation
7. Forward the Foundation.

Tie in books (Asimov tied in a lot of his stories in his later books)

1. The Robot Series
2. Galatic Empire Series (A look at the start of the Impirium)
(sorry, I cant think of the names of the books)

Actually, the problem with this example is that it wouldn\'t work.   :-)

Yes, liquid Hydrogen could be used to absorb radiated heat from the jump
drive.  As a liquid absorbs heat, it will eventually vapourize (at -253 C
or 20 Kelvin).  Once the Hydrogen gas has absorbed a specific amount of
heat energy, it must be pumped away from the drive.  The problem now
becomes, what do you transfer the heat energy locked away within the
hydrogen gas *to*?

Space is void of any matter to which the heat energy can be transferred to.
True, the gaseous Hydrogen can be transferred to radiators mounted on the
hull which would eventually radiate as infrared, but it wouldn\'t be enough.
Additionally, the act of compressing a gas back into a liquid transfers a
great deal of heat into the pump itself (ie: to reduce the temperature of
something, something else must absorb that energy).  Now the pump must be
cooled as well  :-)

This is where the idea of heating up LHyd and ejecting it from the
spacecraft came from.  Apollo missions relied on this technique and so does
today\'s space shuttle.

We seem to be discussing two different thing here. I was arguing about
the factual effects of various monetary systems and the true nature of
money. I thought you were too. Now it appears that you are arguing about
what people thought/will think about money. That\'s something entirely
different, something we may not even disagree on. (Although I\'d like to 
think that there\'s at least the possibility that future generations 
_might_ learn a bit from the mistakes of past ones. After all, this is 
Science _fiction_ we\'re talking about here ;-)

>and sometimes the lessons we learn are wrong.

True, but sometimes they are right. I admit that economics is still an
immensely fuzzy and badly-understood subject, not nearly as clear-cut
as the simplified examples I gave in the previous post, but surely it
is at least a little better understood today than it was 300 years ago.

But in factual matters at least one of us will be wrong. (There\'s always
the possibility that we will both be wrong, of course).
 
>History is NOT immutable!  

As a social phenomenon, no, but as a reflection of reality it is. We may 
never be able to determine the truth, but there is one. If an event took 
place at a specific time then there\'s an objective truth about when that 
event took place. No amount of later editing of history will change that. 

>A specific culture\'s experiences color their understanding of events, 
>including past events.  

True, but it dosen\'t alter the events. And sometimes the events can be
deduced from their effects.

>Anything historical, beyond basic facts (and even then more often than you\'d
>suspect), is always an interpretation.  And as, over time, a culture\'s

But reinterpretation is of limited use in affecting the real world. If you
kill someone you may be able to change the historical record to make believe
you didn\'t, but no amount of reinterpretation will bring that person back to
life. History isn\'t quite as fluid as you make out. Reality has a way of
limiting the plausibility of the more imaginative reinterpretations.

And, of course, when it comes to economics, history is simply a mass of
data from which one may attempt to deduce economic facts. If those data
are valid there\'s an increased chance that the deductions will be valid
(so if the deductions turn out to be valid that\'s evidence (though not
proof) that the data was valid too).

Of course Shakespeare *was* junk (or at least pop) culture, to a large
degree, when it was written.  It is only centuries of perspective and
changed ideas that make it "classic", or whatever other label of
respectability you wish to assign it.  Much of Shakespeare was smutty,
or needlessly violent, or racist, or anti-semitic, etc., which are all
the charges thrown at much of junk/pop culture today.  However,
somehow it survived, and now we put it on a pedestal.

About the Gazelle.  This was originally a CT/High Guard design (from
Traders & Gunboats).  The external tanks were drop tanks - the fuel
was all used prior to entering jump to open the way into jump space,
and the tanks were dropped to reduce the vessel\'s displacement, so
increasing its range.  J-5 with tanks dropped, J-4 with tanks
retained, and J-2 (!) without the fuel in the tanks.  Fuel bladders
didn\'t work in the High Guard/MT designs because you couldn\'t use the
fuel directly - you had to pump it into more permanent tanks first.  I
think under MT you could design it with sufficient jump fuel to have
good performance without the tanks, but the tanks added to its
flexibility.

Why can\'t you just enjoy a movie without worrying about reality. I can 
point out lots of problems with being able to hack into an alien ship\'s
computer system too if I wanted to . 

However I am content to say "Its a summer movie" and simply enjoy it.

Canon in CT was that you burned up the jump fuel "charging" the drive
for the jump. And if you are "burning"(fusing) that much hydrogen in
that short a time you *will* need coolant!

Remember the Annic Nova? It used solar power to charge its drive for
jump. It took it a good long while, but it did it. (and yes, I know it
is no longer considered canon).

So the way I see it is the drive burns all that fuel quickly, and then
pushes the ship into jumpspace with the right vector. A week or so
later you drop out as the "charge" dissipates.

This goes with the rules I remember regarding having only a limited
period of time when you could be ready to jump instantly. You could
charge up the drive, but it could only sit there charged for so long
before you either had to jump or had to dump the power somehow.

And this *doesn\'t* leave the engineers twiddling their thumbs while in
jump. Jumping is a strain on the drive, especially the modified power
plant that burns all that hydrogen. So they\'ll need to go over it
carefully, to make sure it came through ok. If it didn\'t, they\'ll still
come out of jump ok, but they\'d be stuck. Most engineers and ship
owners would rather have the drive available when they come out
*especially* if they have the fuel to make a second jump.

You can\'t do that, because you can\'t make collapsible bladders for
liquid hydrogen. At liquid hydrogen temps, not a lot of things are
flexible. Plus, you have to insulate the LH2 against sunlight or most
of it will boil off. Finally, accelerating at only *one* gee will put
some pretty severe stress on the bladder. In case you haven\'t noticed,
bladders are always laid out on a *horizontal* surface, not just
because they need the support, but because the *pressure* exerted by
the liquid inside depends on how *deep* it is. Something streching from
the nose to the tail is going to have *real* troubles with the
pressure at the bottom end.

Bladders can be used to convert cargo space to tankage, because they
have the walls and floor for support.

But for carrying fuel externally you need *rigid* containers, these are
known as "drop tanks". You can charge the drive from the fuel in them,
drop them, and jump.

BTW, even if you could use external bladders, there\'s the matter of
what they weigh, what the gear to stow them weighs, and finally, their
extreme vulnerability to everything from micrometeorites to weapons
fire. Would *you* want to have your jump fuel be the first thing to go
in a fight?

Remember, back then myths and legends *were* "pop culture". This was
true right up until the Renaisance. 

So the fact that we know the epic of Gilgamesh and similarly old
stories (the Iliad and the Odessy refer to *events* OLDER than 1600 BC
as I recall).

Hell, those bits of "pop culture" have been re-worked over and over
again in the myths, legends and ballads that have followed.

Hey, you\'d be *amazed* at what bits survive. We owe beer to the
Babylonians, for example. Or for a *weirder* example of how things
carry over in unexpected ways, take the width of "standard" gauge
railroads. 

Why are the rails spaced the way they are? Because back when the
railroads started in England, the wagon wrights built the first
railroad cars. They already had jigs and tooling set up to produce
wagons with that wheel spacing.

So why were the wagon wheels spaced that way? To fit the ruts in all
the roads (if you made them a different width, you were likely to break
axles a lot more often due to the mismatch).

So why were the ruts spaced like that? Well, they dated back to the
"built in" ruts in Roman roads. They were built to match the wheel
spacing of the standard Roman chariot. 

It may be possible to trace it farther, but that much is certain. And
that makes standard rail guage based on a "milspec" over 2000 years
old!

"Car" is a term that goes *well* back into the middle ages if not
farther. Refers to a sort of wagon/chariot. That one has survived
multiple *language* shifts!

What was neede was the sort of thing that even *Star Trek* did halfway
decently. You refer to a few things that people recognize from ancient
history and contemporary history. Then you tack on some extra
references to events in *their* past, but our future. Like mentioning
the a list of important legal documents... the Magna Carta, The
Declaration of Independence, the Mish\'nim of Sylea...

Or "evil" conquerors: Gengis Khan, Hitler, Kahless, ...

You get the idea.

Frankly I think Star Trek goes too far in the *other* direction, they
have too *little* pop culture surviving. Babylon 5 does better, with
references to things like some cartoons that will probably survive
until the culture becomes unrecognizable, and references to things like
"rock" and "heavy metal" music the way we would refere to baroque or
Renaisance music. 

Also, do recall that one reason we *don\'t* have large amounts of "old"
pop culture is that it didn\'t survive. The Greek plays that survive are
still watchable. The tales like the Odysey, Iliad, and epic of
Gilgamesh are still good stories. 

Likewise, while there\'s no way of knowing *which* will survive the
"test of time", there *will* be contemporary music that is still played
in the 47th century. Ditto for other forms of entertainment. Monty
python? Maybe. (Me, I\'d put my bet on Warner Bros and Disney cartoons
as being the most likely to survive. Heck, many folks don\'t get half
the jokes and cultural references in them *now*, yet they still enjoy
the humor when Bug nails someone)

Gee, I bet I know where the expression "chewing the fat" (colliquialism

Given the diet at that time, it might not have been all that unhealthy.
Remember, it is possible to *die* if your diet is too *lean*. An all
too common (and unpleasant) way to die among people surviving by
hunting game. Especially folks in "survival" situations who are having
to live off things like rabbits).

Meat was not as frequent an item in the diet, neither was milk or
butter unless you were well off. So your fat intake was way down.

If we did it *right* it would be.

That means that we get all the phsyics, economics etc worked out so we
can stick in "reasonable" costs and performance figures, but we don\'t
have to beat the players over the head with the details. It\'s like the
multi-level design system, as long as the simplified stuff is
*compatible* with the complex stuff, the only problem is that you lose
some "subtle" possibilities.

Whatever it is, it *isn\'t* a laser. 

But I\'d say that wrecking the output end of anything sending out
nuclear level amounts of energy is going to result in the energy being
deposited in the ship, rather than the target. 

Me, I\'m surprised that there was that much *left* of the ship,
considering what they did to the cities.

ps. Assuming we can recover enough data from the wreckage to build our
own, one would hope that all involved have the brains to make our
vessels look as *little* like theirs as is practical. :-)

Not quite true. Modern anti-ship missiles are designed to go after
modern ships. The Exocet that badly damaged the HMS Sheffield wouldn\'t
do much of anything to the New Jersey or the Iowa.

It *is* possible to carry enough armor, simply because air-to surface
missiles have a restricted payload.  Ditto for surface to surface. They
trade payload for *range*. There aren\'t any anti-ship missiles with the
penetration of an 18-inch shell! But we built ships that were expected
to survive multiple hits from such. 

At some point it\'s going to sink in that we are far more likely to be
fighting people with Exocets than with nuclear weapons. And thus, we
should go back to armoring at least *some* ships well enough to survive
such.

But fighters (aircraft) are *much* faster than capital ships. For that
matter, PT boats are faster than capital ships! They trade speed for
range, and agility for armor.

The really big problem in Traveller is that there\'s nothing to hide
behind. No horizon, no clouds, and it never gets dark. It\'s one *hell*
of a lot harder to "sneak up" on someone to make that quick dash into
firing range.

    'body' => 'Hi there

Well, as someone posted his theory, I\'ll try mine.  If you haven\'t
seen Survivial Margin, I\'ll try and make sense of this without that.

All references to the existence of the Virus prior to Dulinor
releasing it were in secret documents.  Thus, I keep much of the
public information as is.  My idea goes like this:


Dulinor\'s Victory Fleet, instead of being wasted by the Virus, reach
Capital, and beats Lucan.  I think this is plausible, as Dulinor was
always the better leader and politician than Lucan.  To assist in
this, I assume that Lucan\'s forces are so riddled with people who look
out for themselves that not only is Dulinor able to beat Lucan and
take the Imperial Palace, but Lucan is actually captured and executed
personally by Dulinor on a world-wide hololink.  Unfortunately for
Dulinor at this point, a group of Aslan assasins, assisted by remnants
of the (disbanded) Aslan Guard, gain entry to the Throne room (where
Lucan was executed), and while the Guard hold off Dulinor\'s troops,
the Emperor is killed in an Aslan challenge, which is broadcast
world-wide, and carried out-system by Lucan-loyal escapees.

I had this chain of events because Dulinor and Lucan, whom I consider
the villains of the Rebellion get their just desserts, but their
importance as the leaders of what are still the two strongest factions
meant that their deaths would also prevent the reemergence of the
Imperium - I think pocket empires without the Virus are a far more
fitting end to the Third Imperium.  Lucan\'s realm would shatter, as
all the ruthless members of his armed forces attempt to survive,
escape, or remain in control.  Dulinor\'s Domain would collapse more
slowly, as his government try to conceal the fact of his death, but
ultimately are unable to hold things together without his charismatic
leadership.  Perhaps his daughter would rule a large pocket in
Illelish.  I think by this point, Antares is already in chaos after
the death of Brzk.  Thus, there is a band of chaos across the Imperium
from Illelish to Antares.  The only real problems with this are what
would the other factions do?  However, by this point everyone is so
commited to their faction that it would be difficult to attempt
reunification.  The Solomani are bogged down in internal politics.
The possibility that trade with the Imperium was important to the
Confederation may result in its further decline.  Indeed, for many of
its more independent member-states, the demise of the Imperium means
that the reason for the Confederation has gone.  Daibei would look on
the chaos with alarm, and perhaps be able to act to stop some of it,
but it will always be wary of opportunists from the Confederation, the
Hierate, or the Reaver\'s Deep.  Margaret will probably develop her
links with the Hiver, habouring hopes of expanding her "domain" to
something akin to the Imperium, but then she is not a "great leader"
in the mold of say Cleon I.  The Vilani suffer from internal problems
which preclude them expanding.  Strephon is too weak to counter the
encroaching chaos, although his worlds may from the nucleus of a
Scout-led resurgence at a much later date.  Norris has major worries
with his neighbours, and is "keeping the flame" - a decision made
before the emergence of the Virus, he had already decieded the
Imperium was dead.  Perhaps some minor war with the Sword Worlds will
keep Deneb off-balance.  Essentially, as of 1150, I see numerous small
states, independent worlds, and barren areas across the core of the
Imperium; the Ziru Sirkaa battling on, but becoming increasingly
insular (damned unstable Solomani, destroying our empire!), Margaret
expanding into Spica via trade with the Hiver, Daibei and Deneb
holding their own against their respective neighbours, and the
Solomani Confederation falling apart.  Vargr roam freely as far
rimward as Core Sector, contributing to the ongoing chaos, and
Strephon despairs as never before.  In fact, I may even postulate that
the "real Strephon" really, really was an imposter, who believed the
lies of his "advisors" (puppet masters); the only evidence we have of
his authenticity are in his own diaries, which may be the product of a
mis-informed clone.  The clone, for various reasons, hasn\'t the
ability to lead as Strephon would have done.  One reason for this is
that I realy don\'t believe that the loving father and husband Strephon
is portrayed as would have kept the existence of his clones secret
from his wife - Iolanthe would have known where the real Strephon was.
Finally, the real Strephon wouldn\'t have fled to Gushemege, and
wouldn\'t have advisors who were that stupid.  The Strephon portrayed
in Survival Margin should not have been on the throne - whether this
lead to his failure to forsee the assasination, or this was because
the "real" Strephon was an imposter isn\'t clear.

My aims here were:

1) to minimise changes to published material (which reduces the work
needed)

2) generate the death of the Imperium without some bizarre mechanism
(ie. the Virus.)

3) set up numerous minor empires.

Gushemege: The Imperium (what else could Strephon\'s realm be?), a
functional government with a view to helping the surrounding chaos to
abate, and ultimately form a new government - handicapped by a lack of
power, and Strephon\'s lack of faith in his own abilities.

Vland: The Ziru Sirkaa, an insular government, trading internally, but
avoiding external trade which has been "proven" to be unprofitable
(after being burned in trade with the Vargr, and being unable to find
stable trade in the chaotic Imperial Core).

Deneb: A stable government, which is spends its time trying to ensure
stable Vargr governments at its borders, staving off Aslan clans, and
keeping a woried eye on its traditional enemies, the Zhodani.

Daibei: Another stable government, but much more damaged by the
collapse in the Imperial Core.  I see this small federation growing
culturally by the influx of refugees, especially many aliens
(eg. Vegans), and perhaps Aslan as a result of hiring mercenaries to
assist in protection.

Margaret: The self-styled Empress rules her Empire (Maggie\'s Empire -
sorry, UK reference there) as a trading nation based on slavery and
external trade with the Hiver.  On the core/spinward edge, raids into
the surrounding chaos provide slaves which allow the citizens of the
Empire to live a life of leisure.  On the trailing/rimward edge, trade
with the Hiver brings prosperity.  Ultimately, these two aspects come
into conflict, and Tukera and Hiver "advisors" compete to control the
Empire.

Solomani Confederation: Still exists around Terra, and the coreward
Solomani Rim, where most worlds have never belonged to other
nation-states.  However, beyond the Solomani Rim, few worlds retain
allegiance to the Confederation.

Right.  If they\'d said, "Yeah, we\'ve been studying the alien\'s systems 
for the last 30 years, so we know how to create a virus that will affect 
them," I would\'ve believed it.  But they made a point of saying the

Yup.  I\'m not a fan of Will Smith (didn\'t like his TV show, didn\'t like 
his music), but I thought he stole the show in ID4.  When he started 
kicking the alien because he was tired of dragging the alien across the 
desert, I thought, "That\'s exactly how I\'d feel." :)

Stewart, it is never stated, but I always thought this was how the Star

person\'s allocation to be very high...  let\'s say each is equivalent of a

   I tried to pattern the stats as closely as possible after the work done
in The Regency Sourcebook (with one notable exception, see below),
the gold standard IMHO (if only they hadn\'t tried to cram 112 pages of
material into 96....eeech!), and previous classic GDW Traveller
publications.

   The concept here is that we\'ll give you enough stuff up front to get you
started, then continue to present material down the road.  The
concentration initially will be on the New Era setting, but other additional
material for the Second Solomani Rim War, Year Zero, etc. will also be
included as time/space/Kevin Knight\'s budget permits.

   Mechanics-wise, the vehicles and equipment will be FF&S based.
As Imperium Games publishes modified design sequences for T4, I\'ll
endeavor to convert everything to the new standard, and present new
T4-based designs as well.

   It was a concept I felt strongly enough about to continue developing,
even as GDW slid into oblivion.

   This explanation is the one presented in the Vampire Fleets
sourcebook.  I of course expanded upon it somewhat in creating the
description for the remainder of the subsector.

   I\'m glad you enjoyed TTC #10.

   For those of you who are interested in meeting the author of Children
of Earth, I\'ll be at Gen Con this year checking out the Imperium Games
booth and participating at many of the Traveller events.  I hope to see
you there, even if the whole convention is controlled by the Evil Empire
(tm)  (aka TSR).

   Also, someone has pointed out that the 1202 world UWP stats appear
above the 1117 stats, and that in other GDW publications (most notably
the Regency Sourcebook), when dual stat listings were used, that the
1117 stats appeared above the 1201 stats.

   While I apologize if there was confusion on anyone\'s part, this was
an area where I departed from the RSB standard.  IMHO, ergonomically
having the 1202 stat on the same line as the rest of the UWP information
makes it easier to read, particularly if you are interested in what the stats
are *now*, and the 1117 stats are of secondary interest/importance.

It may have been closer to what we call pop culture, but seldom junk culture.

Even though the theater-going experience was quite different than it is
today, Shakespeare was already on a pedastal in the late 1500s. Heck, it\'s
said Queen Elizabeth wanted him to write "The Merry Wives of Windsor"
because she wanted to see Falstaff in love. The
violence/racism/anti-semitism are what WE label aspects of his works, not
what they were labelled in his day. I doubt if many Londoners boycotted
"The Merchant of Venice" because of its portrayal of Shylock.

Well, I\'d probably put the Carry On movies on the same level as corn dogs,
but then, I\'m a vegetarian. :-) Will "Carry On Doctor" become the "Hamlet"
of 2500 AD? Lord help us all. But at least something like a "Carry On"
referrence in TNE would have ballanced some of the other 20th century
American referrences.

(Yes, I know the Python referrences are British. But I think - if they HAD
to include them - they should have found something as obscure to us as corn
dogs are to many other cultures).

Now, If they had included some GOON SHOW referrences, I\'d have been
impressed. :-)

Actually Twinkies are a form of plant life from another planet.  They are 
eaten live, which would explain why Twinkies seem to last for years.  
When King Tut\'s Pyramid was unearthed, they found a corpse, tons of 
jewelry and ornaments, and a box of Twinkies.  They were labelled 
"Sell By June 4, 446 BC."  The explorer happily pulled open the box 
of Twinkies, found them to be fresh, and ate them...

There are rumors that Grandfather actually geneered Twinkies, as he 
wanted to have something to eat that would not go bad under any 
circumstances...  

When the Final War began, Grandfather launched the first blows not 
with nuclear devices, or with warbots, but by orbital bombardment.  
He took 0.1 cm twinkies out of the wrapper, and dropped them on 
several of the homeworlds of his children...those not killed by the 
resulting impact were left with nothing but Twinkies to eat...

Yum...think I\'m going to go buy some Twinkies and corn dogs right 
now... ;-)

Granted, it was popular culture at the time...but remember that 
popular culture of the 16th-17th century is not quite the same thing 
as that of the 20th century.  There would have been tons of people in 
Britain who\'d never heard of Shakespeare when he died, let alone seen 
1 of his plays...  However, the bulk of your points are valid.

I guess I\'m truly afraid that the only thing the 20th century is 
going to be remembered for is Calvin and Hobbes.  I\'d like to think 
that our century has more to offer...maybe I\'m kidding myself.  

Not certain that Bach was ever pop culture though.  He wrote a lot of 
the stuff for the cathedral that he worked in, and was a court 
composer, if I\'m not mistaken...hardly work for the masses, although 
many may have heard

Other than that which makes it to the other side of the pond, I\'m not 
likely to...

Just as I\'m sure that there are elements of American pop culture that 
may be incomprehensible to you...  Hell, to be honest, some of them 
are incomprehensible to me... ;-)

Kind of leads me to another interesting debate.  What elements of 
popular culture would survive as art from the 20th century?

Not for too many of your players.  Pretty soon you\'d wind up having 
1000 page rule books, devoting a voluminous number of pages to explanation 
of a pseudo-scientific concept that currently is impossible using present 
day physics.  It doesn\'t matter how much time, volume of pages, or 
money you poor at it, the thing is called science FICTION...

Suspension of disbelief does have to come into play somewhere.  Jump 
drive, Maneuver drive (thrusters or HEPlaR), meson guns, PAWs, don\'t 
exist...  They probably won\'t exist in our lifetimes...if ever...

If you don\'t suspend disbelief somewhere...think about what you have 
left...  present day guns, missiles, vehicles...landbound on 1 
system...because there is no effective means currently for getting to 
Mars, let alone Alpha Centauri...  We don\'t even have the 
technology to establish a colony on the moon...

As for simulating an economic system good luck!  No 2 economists 
can really design an economic model that simulates a world economy 
effectively, and agree on it...  I remember an old joke about 2
economists trying to design a Trivial Pursuit game based on 
economics.  They came up with a game that had 3000 questions, and 
about 12,000 right answers...

As with anything, you need to write an explanation that sounds 
halfway plausible, and at some point you as a referee, and the player 
have to take the rest on faith...

As with all things, it is for the players in conjunction with the 
referee to balance realism vs. playability...  The good news is that 
the Traveller system has in the past (and would appear to be doing in 
the future) allowed you to choose to a certain extent...

    'topic' => 'Don Perrin at Phenomenon',
    'body' => 'Dear Folks -

Well, I met the man on the weekend, while he was at Phenomenon. He and 
Margaret "Dragonlance" Weis were invited over as special guests to the 
convention. Unfortunately, I only had an hour to talk to him (I think it 
may have been a new experience for Margaret. I assume that *she* usually 
gets the groupies, rather than Don! Sorry I didn\'t have more time to talk 
with you both).

I took along my *Martian Metals* tank, grav APC, and air/raft (yeah, am I 
a groupie or what?). He didn\'t remember having seen the grav APC before 
(Loren told this list that not even MM has one of these! This may explain 
the RCVG pictures). He also saw some of my grav tanks and APCs, lead 
miniatures imported from the UK (when I find the details, I\'ll post them 
here. An importer in Melbourne supplies Oz, but BITS should be able to 
get them directly). Finally, I was able to give him some reading material 
for his return flight - the results of Marc\'s "Whither Traveller?" 
survey, the 1201 Tavonni RICE Paper, and a complete list of everyone\'s 
Web pages - I\'ve saved up all of your details, guys and girls, so maybe 
some more links will appear at IG\'s link page.

Don was at Phenomenon to run demo games of his *Wing Commander* card game 
(co-authored w/Jeff Grubb) and his own *Star of the Guardians* tactical 
card game. When I met him, he was running a game of *Silent Death*, with 
lead miniatures (bet those caused excess baggage!). BTW, in the game I 
watched, two fighters took out a *large* ship each. This is one game
where fighters are useful!

I really liked the "map" - a black cloth overlayed with 
*Battletech*-style hexes, plus other spots of colour and (what I assume 
is) a nebula. This very striking battle map is available from the 
*Battletech* people (FASA?); basically, is is a space version of their 
standard map.

Don told me he is very impressed with the level of support for 
*Traveller*. He is most impressed with the amount of effort that 
_players_ have contributed to T4 - especially given the short (read 
_miniscule_) time-frame. He and David Golden are planning to upgrade FF&S 
(yay!), probably over a longer period than IG was able to allow for QSDS 
and SSDS.

The original reason for suggesting that Book2 and Book5 be used is this: 
_High Guard_ sold 200,000 copies. _Megatraveller_ sold 20,000 copies. TNE 
(including FF&S) sold 2,000 copies. Each rules set dropped an order of 
magnitude in sales! Admittedly, these were also sold in different 
role-playing eras - there was much less competition when "the little 
black books" were released. However, these figures should tell you 
something of the dilemma facing IG - they need to win over or win back a 
solid customer support base. All the more reason to encourage local games 
stores to stock T4, I say!

Apparently, everything is at the printers. Oh - and one mystery solved! I 
asked the question (previously posted on this list): "why 96 pages?" The 
answer is, yes, this *is* a magic number. Printers print multiple pages 
on large paper sheets called "forms". These sheets are then folded and 
cut along the edge to produce individual leaves, ready for binding. 
Leaves generally hold multiples of 16 pages, ie. 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. 
Now, 32 + 64 = 96 pages. Keeping the number of pages down to what can 
easily be printed on one or two "forms" saves money.

Before I left, we headed down to see the *Bridge Crew* scenario - "The 
Prophecy". *Bridge Crew* is a computer-aided RPG, written by some folks 
from _Mithril Software_ (based in Queanbeyan, near Canberra). Basically, 
a couple of fast PC\'s run a number of dumb terminals plus a TV display 
("put it on screen, Mr Data"). The terminals are set up as Phasers, 
Torpedoes, Navigation, Damage Control, Science, etc. On screen, your 
immediate surrounds are displayed - your ship, the friendly transport 
ships you are supposed to be defending, the enemy ships intent on blowing 
you up, nearby planets to run into, and so on. The software has been 
expanded so that it now allows multiple friendly ships - which is what 
this scenario was about. Two ships are sent off to a remote outpost, in 
search of a 150-year-old prophecy - and that\'s all I know! The "crews" 
were in two separated rooms, communicating via an intercom ("open hailing 
frequencies, Mr Worf!").

And finally, congratulations to Don and Margaret. They are set to marry 
later this year (September?). I think I can speak on behalf of "us fans" 
in wishing you all the best. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me.

This is also true of many of the works of Motzart!  And of course, we all

about whether the "reality" in question!  The possibility of a woman and her
child and her dog surviving an explosion coming through the tunnel without
entering her little cubby hole is completely out of the question!  I thought
the movie was excellent.  I\'m actually considering seeing it again before it
leaves the theater (something I\'ve never done before).  I will definitely
purchase the video.

My point above was just a simple question to see if that was realistic for
traveller.  I think the movie was not a traveller-esque movie, but I do see
benefits of this movie for discussion here on TML!  I\'m sorry for you if all
you do is "say "Its a summer movie" and simply enjoy it."  I try to use all
of my experiences to learn something if I can.  This movie had things in it
that I had no idea whether it was possible, so I simply asked a question to
expand my mind.  Maybe you should try this!

Sorry everyone for posting this to the list, but it really ticked me off!

Yeah, but a 100 aircraft launching a couple hundred Exocets?  There 
won\'t be enough of the New Jersey or Iowa left to send home in a 
shoebox.  The battleships were not reactivated for any purpose other 
than shore bombardment, from what I understand.  True, the Tomahawks 
make them a deadlier weapon than they would be with just the 16" 
guns...but there are a lot cheaper anti-ship platforms to operate 
than the Iowa...

As a matter of fact, the cost of building a battleship is probably 
the single biggest argument against anybody ever building another 
one.  With the cost of building a modern warship being very high, 
it\'s easier and cheaper to build a half dozen cheap unarmored 
guided-missile cruisers than to build a 1990\'s era version of the 
Iowa (and you\'d wind up with more firepower doing so as well).

The US just happened to have them mothballed, and thought it could be 
useful to use them again...  Nobody was really paying attention, but 
the day of the heavily armored dreadnought died in the 1930\'s.  It 
just took a few battles (Taranto, Cape Matapan, Pearl Harbor, Midway, 
etc...) for everybody to realize it... Its doubtful any ship could 
hold up against an enemy with air superiority...for long anyways...

Actually, there are a number of theorists I\'ve read who tend to 
believe that the day of the surface warship is almost done, that in 
an era of satellite and aerial long range reconnaissance, that it is 
going to be increasingly difficult for any warship that can\'t hide to 
survive.  Then again we really haven\'t seen a blue water ocean 
campaign in the classical sense since Japan surrendered.

Who defines "Doing it right"?  No matter how it is done, to be sci fi
liberties arer going to be taken.  Otherwise we would have a game where
the players are limited to chemical rockets, nuclear fission, and lead
slug throwers.  Realistic, but not a good setting for the far future.

Again, who defines "the right way" to do it??

Ya...  I kinda thought of that after I sent it, but the option was write 
an imediate rebuttle to my letter, which wouldn\'t make a difference 
because everyone would read the other part first, or go to bed and sleep. 

Sleep naturally won out.
 
I still think you\'d have a problem with freezing on the outside of the 
J-Drive, you know that old cold surface attracts condensation, 
condensation freezes, ice melts, lots of water.  Unless you had so little 
humidity in the air that this\'d no longer be a problem.  But wouldn\'t 
that be uncomfortable?  I live in a city where rain is the natural state 
of the atmosphere so I can\'t imagine no humidity.

Here is an example of one of the unneeded "powers" that does not need
to be attributed to Virus. Why should Virus be able to infect (or "lay
an egg in") my transistor radio simply because it has "a radio link"
and there\'s silicon in the transistors? This is just plain not needed
to make the devastation caused by Virus possible.

My point was that you *can* build a safe hand computer. You admitted
that it\'s safe if it only interacts with its owner (it *is* a hand
computer after all). I won\'t get into the provability of a safe hand
computer that also has sensors, since you already indicated that you
attribute certain "impossible" capabilities to Virus.

It was Shirley from Imperium Games  :-)

Apparently, she was having problems processing my order.  My VISA card
expired on 06/96 when I placed my order back in mid June.  After the call,
I remembered that Shirley had mentioned that IG would not be billing me
until July.  I quickly sent them some email notifying them of the change (I
had received my new card only days later) and someone replied that they had
made a note of it.

So today, Shirley calls up and tells me she is having problems with my
order (apparently she did not get my email but I quickly explained the
situation and everything is all right now).

I also mentioned that she was generating a lot of praise on the net, with
stories of IG calling up various customers to varify problem orders.  I
could hear her blush!  I was so surprised to get the call that I forgot to
ask about the release date of T4.  Doh!

So Stu and Joe, and everyone else out there that has been contacted by IG--
her name is Shirley  :-)

  Khyber pass is a reference to a battle in the English colonial period in

Yes, I realized that after I had sent my post.  That\'s what I get for
jumping into a bundle of digests midway through.  Given the relatively
loose controls in the imperium and the difficulty in enforcing equal
access to information I can see what you\'re getting at.

It would depend on what the investigators did to get that information.  But
so long as it was "legal", yes, I would say that it probably wouldn\'t be a
problem in the third Imperium.  

Do the MegaCorps and others maintain their own "private" XBoat equivalent
mail networks?  If people are competing on the basis of access to
information/news, I can see that happening - unless that is declared in
violation of some form of Imperial charter.

Giant computers. :) Mysterious, unexplained  methods of interstellar
travel. Plot above nit-picky little details.

The order they were written in. Plus, read the Robot series before
you get into the later Foundation books, as you need to know what
happened way back then too. Basically, read the books in the order
Asimov wrote them, not in the order they occur with respect to the
books\' internal timeline. The way the books tie together at th eend,
you almost have to read everthing Asimov ever wrote, in the order he wrote
it. Someone else posted a list. I suppose you could skip his non-
fiction stuff, but heck, that 3-part physics series wouldn\'t hurt either. :)

Definitely Psychohistory, as Asimov wrote his first books with these in, in

James,

Ah, thanks.  Certainly she will soon be taking her rightful place among 
the various Traveller mythos told by the afficianados thereof.  :)  20 
years from now:  "Yeah, well, I actually /talked/ to Shirley, back in 
\'96.  She saved Imperium Games, you know." :)

Yes. PLUS, when quoting from Traveller\'s "past," you don\'t focus on late
20th century Americana (with Python thrown in) to the exclusion of OTHER
past times or cultures. More Shakespeare, for example, or Euripides, or
Euro trash culture. The latter TNE releases just struck me as being myopic
in this respect.

Huh.  So you\'re saying the, in the Imperium (circa CT) it is illegal for 
an entity other than the Imperil government to purchase or requisition a 
J-5 or J-6 capable starship, without getting some sort of clearance from 
the government?  Interesting.

Good idea.  I like this better than the 5x standard cargo rates 
rule...more flexibility is good.  And your specific idea of a Haphazard 
Message Company is a good one, too. :)

  Actually, this is one of the reasons I liked GDW\'s 2300AD so much.  By 
setting things three hundred years in the future, one could logically 
postulate a linkage to present-day culture and political forms, with some 
odd changes (the French as the dominant world power!?).  You\'re right, it 
doesn\'t work as well for TNE.

  I feel the need to disagree, at least with respect to Millieu 0.  It 
has not been long since Europeans (and Americans for that matter) spent a 
large amount of time studying Greek and Roman language and history.  In 
the United States, at least, some degree of mastery of Latin was required 
to enroll in college until the late 19th Century - the rise of 
engineering is really what did that in finally.  I remember being taught 
latin and greek roots in high school so as to prepare for language 
tests, and there are some schools (mostly Catholic ones) that still 
stress latin and greek in their curriculum.

  Why did this situation come about?  Prior to the late 19th Century, 
Roman civilization and Roman civil engineering were in evidence all 
around.  As European societies expanded and organized themselves, they 
did so in the shadow of a Roman empire that had spanned a greater area 
than any one country, and that had moreover managed to build civil works 
(walls, aqueducts, roads) that outmatched anything contemporary society 
could accomplish.

  To my mind, the Syleans are in much the same situation.  As they expand 
to the stars, everywhere they are reminded that they are not the first, 
that the First Imperium and the Rule of Man preceeds them.  Moreover, I 
would imagine that engineers would study old records for a hint on what 
could be done and how to do it.  To my mind, Sylean exploration teams 
would include data-recovery specialists, trained in the operation and 
interpretation of First Imperium records.

  As a result, the history of the First Imperium and the Folks from Terra 
who Ended Their Glorious Rule will probably be a part of the average history
curriculum in Millue 0, or even later.  Of course, by the time period of 
Classic Traveller, much of that history has probably been cut out of the 
curriculum, to make room for the study of all those Emperors of the Flag.

Of course they were essentially pouring the hull.. place the fittings,
pour the hull and main decks, let dry, add necessary extras, launch.

With metallic ceramics the Imperium could get the same effect.  It
would be quite good for SDB\'s and in-system fuel tankers, more
difficult for jump capable ships (form the jump grid,
place the jump, power plant, and maneuver drives, blow rock
foam into place for structure, acdd bridge and sensors).

I\'m only going to talk about the suggestion that is germane to these lists,
but will emails those who offered ideas.

The North Pier is a big building just north of the Loop that houses a
variety of tourist-oriented shops, a food court, a couple of bars, and some
video arcades.  One of the arcades, on the second floor, is devoted to a
virtual reality simulation of Battletech.  You sit in the cockpit of the
battletech machine.  You can race through a mine in a grav speeder, or fight
each other on the surface in battle suits.  Then you can watch it on video.
I didn\'t participate (my reflexes not being what they were twenty or
twenty-five years ago), but saw some good action.  

There are also two very nice and very large miniatures on display. One is a
battletech machine, and the other looks like a grav ore carrier.

Thanks to Marc Miller for this suggestion.

Ultrarealism?  hmmm.  I guess you\'re right.  If it was taken too far, it 
wouldn\'t be fun at all.  I suppose the question is, how far is far 
enough?  How real do we want it?

But what if we did the sorts of things I mentioned above - got rid of all 
glaring holes in the plotlines/background, kept our technology without 
obvious holes (don\'t stick to what we know for sure is possible (ie, what 
we\'re able to do right now), but don\'t go so far out there that you 
threaten to suspend your audience\'s disbelief), and so on?  

Is it possible to do all of that without destroying Traveller?  And would 
the result be fun?

This is along the lines of what I was thinking of.  It seems possible to

Okay not going to argue with you one the bladder flexability thing.  57th 
century, who knows.  As for the G\'forces, who cares.  That\'s what 
artifical gravity and inertial compensators (?) are for, if you can 
manouver at 4G and wonder about the halls like nothings happening, I\'m 
sure a hot water bottle on the outside of the ship can take it.  Perhaps 
if you divided the bladder up into baffled sections... anyways.  I\'m not 
huge on the idea of consuming all that fuel so quickly.  We\'ll have to 
wait for the new and improved canon to come out on this one.  I was 
merely making the point that if the fuel is consumed before entering 
jumpspace why not make the tanks external, they don\'t have to be rubber 
but a collapsable framework or something would give you extra cargo 
space.

I think the whole point of this is reproduction.  An organizm doesn\'t 
mean anything in the evolutionary view point if it doesn\'t reproduce.  By 
depositing an "egg" inside anything it can "Virus," the organism, is 
doing all it can to insure it\'s own survival and the survival of it\'s 
species.  Plus, if the pc\'s can just pick up anything and know it\'s safe 
there\'s not much stopping any of a thousand societies from blazing their 
way back across the universe, and destroying anything they see fit.

Okay forget the sensor thing, I\'ve recanted on the sensor thing, to your 
first point I agree, it is a "Safe" system as long as you don\'t do 
anything "unsafe" with it.  Take for example the module "Vampire Fleets." 
 When we were taken aboard the Archer everything electronic we had was 
confiscated and immediatly infected, medi-comps, hand computers, etc.  
The point is, that though none of these items are sophistocated enough 
for the egg to develop it, by planting an egg in the device the second 
you hook it up to something else to download or upload data you\'ve 
infected the other system.  This is Virus\'s whole objective, propegation 
of the species.

You might know that you\'re porticomp is infected, but what if you drop 
it?  What then, some little skate punk comes along, finds it and suddenly 
 it\'s gotten completely out of your hands.

One more thing. There is no reason Virus cannot infect non-silicon
components as well. If they are programmable, understood by Virus,
and susceptible to worms/viruses/etc., Virus *should* be able to
infect them (in the traditional electronic intrusion sense). If it
has physical contact through a robot minion/etc., Virus can rewire
them as well.

True.  Regardless of the explanation, if the item in question is not 
fact, it must be fiction.  Spend a sentence or 1000 pages on it, it 
remains fiction.

Nonetheless, well-reasoned fiction is better than poorly reasoned 
fiction, if only because it serves to suspend the reader\'s disbelief in 
the subject matter.  For instance, IMO the Virus explanation in the main 
TNE rulebook is unbelievable; the items contibuted to this list from the 
Survival Margin sourcebook, however, lend a bit more credence to the 
Virus argument.  Would it not have been better to include a more detailed 
explanation of the Virus phenominon in the main rulebook?  

Ah, but you seem to be asking, "Where do you stop?"  Good question.  I 
supose you would stop when you\'ve got something that will keep the 
critics down to a minimum.  But that just begs the question.  The answer 
seems to lie with talent - some sci-fi authors have such talent, and some 
do not.  But, perhaps it can be learned...and applied to RPGs.

Yes.  But suspension of disbelief should not be an act of will on the 
part of the reader (or player, or referee).  The material should draw one 
in, never dispelling that suspension of disbelief by throwing something 
in the reader\'s face which is glaringly unbelievable.  

The most important aspect might be internal consistency - set up the 
rules of how the universe works, then never violate them.  This is what a 
good fantasy author will do.  Hard science fiction requires more.  Take 
what we know about the universe, then fill in any gaps in that knowledge 
with ideas that do not conflict with the things that are known.  That 
seems, to me, to be a good rule of thumb, anyway.  Then again, I\'m not a 
science fiction author...just a reader.

Yes.  While the game should pick an initial point along the playability 
vs. realism continuum, it should also be possible for the participants to 
choose a somewhat different point to play at.  I simply feel the basis 
should be more to the realism side than the playability side when it 
comes to background, underlying technology, and so on.

You have the tank and APC?  Cool!  Since you are "Down Under," are these things 
still available down there?  I realize that Martian Metals has been gone for 
some time, but I know in North America you could still get the stuff up to 
about seven years ago from RAFM Canada (apparently they had the license for 
Canada, and you could sometimes get them via mail order).   But do you have any 
of the Imperial Sunburst dice?  (I don\'t)

For that matter, how about other 15mm suppliers?  I\'ve got some nice 15mm 
sci-fi vehicles from Tabletop Games in England, and some 15mm "modern" vehicles 
from Yucca Miniatures for the TL7-9 lifestyle.  I have not found any US-based 
manufacturers for the high-tech hardware, though.  The UK people seem to get a 
much better domestic selection.

If anyone knows of a source of  the Martian Metals minis, or even a source for 
the old Grenadier boxed Traveller minis, posting that info to the TML would be 
a good thing (well, for me, anyway)

 The only thing I seem to recall from canonical (there\'s that

 the contractors were _required_ to be armed, to operate a fixed
 route, and to set aside 3 Td (43.5kl) of cargo space, for which
 they were guaranteed payment (25kCr, IIRC).

 So what\'s my point?  A currency doesn\'t have to be backed by
 anything except the reputation of whoever is issuing it.  It
 doesn\'t have to have any intrinsic value; only what people are
 willing to give in production for it.  Money has no _objective_
 value, in spite of anything that Ayn Rand might say.  That\'s
 why money - or more accurately, _representation_of_wealth_, has
 been made of everything from chunks of metal which don\'t seem
 to rot, rust or corrode to skins or shells of dead animals to
 pieces of rock that take two or more people to carry them to
 pieces of paper (or, recently, plastic) bearing pictures of
 living or dead national leaders or heroes or landmarks or works
 of art.

 This is somewhat simplistic - The government doesn\'t realize
 any benefit from those 250K additional notes until they\'re
 placed in circulation, usually through a government purchase
 of some extant goods or services.  At which point the government
 no longer owns the notes.

 The question is "What can those notes buy?"  Under a totally
 uncontrolled, laissez-faire economy, those notes would initiate
 a certain amount of price inflation, as there would be more
 money in circulation chasing fewer goods - at least until
 production caught up.

 Same issue - Gold has no more _intrinsic_ value than the
 banknotes do; its perceived value is due to (a) its comparative
 rarity and (b) what it can purchase (which is influenced in no
 small measure by (a)).  Well, perhaps _some_ intrinsic value,
 as used in jewelry or electronics.  But in those two cases, the
 gold is effectively out of circulation for some period of time,
 and has no real effect on the economy.

 What damaged the Spanish economy so heavily was that gold
 continued to be perceived as having a high value even when its
 comparative rarity had fallen significantly.  That led to
 _nasty_ inflation (a medieval/renaissance version of
 hyperinflation?). There aren\'t too many economies that can
 stand hyperinflation for any length of time...

 A currency need not be backed by anything to be perceived as a
 "gold standard" (_not_ literally) currency - the United States
 dollar has not been backed by _anything_ since we went off the
 metal standard - the only thing behind the Federal Reserve
 Notes (and the few United States Notes still out there) is "the
 full faith and credit of the United States of America".  Yet
 that FFCUSA is the standard against which the values of many
 other currencies are measured, and that FFCUSA is what many
 international transactions not involving the USA or a US
 company are conducted in.

 Many people claim to understand but fail to realize the
 implications of the statement that "Wealth and production are
 equivalent."  The best way to illustrate it is this:

 You have been placed on a semitropical island in its virgin
 state.  You are wearing nothing but your birthday suit, and you
 have no means of getting off the island or of communicating
 with anyone off the island.  There are no dangerous life-forms
 on the island.  There is a pile of gold bars (Fort Knox
 variety) next to you, amounting to ten million troy ounces of
 24K gold.  There is _no_ other product of civilization on the
 island.

 Are you wealthy?  No.  All you\'ve got is over three billion
 dollars worth of metal that you can\'t make into anything
 useful, and can\'t trade for anything that you _could_ make into
 something useful.  You might as well have been dropped there
 without the gold, for all the good it will do you.

 A year later, you\'ve managed to build yourself a reasonably
 sturdy two-room hut, and have some rudimentary wood and stone
 tools and work surfaces.  You\'re located near a good source of
 fresh water, and have managed to cultivate a small garden.  The
 gold mysteriously disappeared your first night on the island.
 A stranger walks up to you while you\'re foraging for some
 things that don\'t grow in your garden, or while you\'re digging
 out some nice stone to work with.  The stranger is in the same
 state you were just one year ago, except that he never had the
 gold that you did.  Who\'s wealthier?  You are - you have the
 products of your own labor, and they have made your life
 easier.  Yet there is no material on the island that wasn\'t
 there when you arrived - all that\'s happened is that you have
 used that material to produce the things that make your life
 easier.  A more graphic illustration of "wealth=production"
 you\'ll be hard-pressed to find.

Yes, the MegaCorps have their own courier service.  At least, that was the 
statement in the writeup on SuSAg from JTAS (number 16 or so).  The article 
mentioned that SuSAg and the other MegaCorps maintained their own x-boat-like 
courier services and had small fleets of company-owned armed escorts (like 
Close Escorts).  I think the Traveller Adventure said the same thing about 
Tukera, the "bad guy" in the campaign.

I just happened to think; there was a lenghty JTAS article on stock trading and 
investing.  I think it even got into one of the Best of the Journal 
compilations.  I wonder if it has anything to say about this?   I\'ll have to 
see if I can find it tonight.

It isn\'t so much a matter of realism, but of internal consistency.


If a new gizmo works on Regina, it will probably work equally
well on Core, and if an engineering advance works on PP\'s it
is likely to work equally as well in a J-drive. If you can generate
a gravity field in the absence of a planetary body, you can reasonably
assume the ability to create a reactionless M-drive.

So it\'s not so much a matter of "realism", just consistency, and
the better the background, the easier it is to maintain that consistency.

That could be the case.  I don\'t recall reading that in the CT materials 
I own, but then again I didn\'t have much information about the Imperium 
until a few years ago....I mostly had rule books, and not many of them. :)

Hmmm.  Would you mind posting them?  Or, if you prefer to wait a month, 
post them with modifications made necessary by the T4 system?  I think it 
would be worthwhile!  But then, it won\'t be my fingers typing all that 
in. [G]

Yup.  Anything can get old and boring if it\'s done too much, but having 
more potential events at hand (pirates, customs gone awry, jump sessions, 
etc.) makes things interesting for the players and the poor, downtrodden 
referee. :)

Whew!  That\'s a lot of useful information!  Thanks for posting it.  
I have aq uestion, though...

I\'ll do some snipping to make it evident what I\'m referring to...

I\'m sure it is due to my unfamiliarity with shipbuilding, but I couldn\'t 
find very much difference between these two methods.  Can you help me 
out, please?  They both seem to be saying that they start with the hull, 
then add other components.  What is the difference between them?


Thanks,

Whew, that\'s quite a difference.  I knew the numbers decreased as you go 
up in versions, but I had no idea of the amount of decrease.  Amazing.

True, less competition undoubtedly played a factor...

...although, that still indicates that more people are familiar with CT 
than any other version.  Dunno how many of those people are still RPG\'rs, 
nor how many would still like a game similar to CT.  

I guess we\'ll find out soon! :)

auxilliary craft or Marines.  Interceptors have less fuel, and thus less patrol 
time, while Heavy Fighters carry a great deal of fuel and extended 
accomodations, making them excellent spacecraft for patrol or picket duty.  All 
are equipped with a laser (two in the case of the Talon) and can carry a 
missile in an undercarriage cradle (two missiles in the case of the Talon).  
The underwing pylons may be equipped with extra fuel tanks, less-powerful TAC

Janeerir-class Assault Lander, 50 tons displacement
Astarga-class Assault Lander, 30 tons displacement

Auxiliaries
Range from 1 to 1,000 tons.  These are all non-Jump vessels, ranging from 1G to 
6G rating.  All of these ships are standardized only in size and control 
interfaces; individual fleets generally procure their own auxiliaries from 
local manufacturers.  All such vessels must be TL14, and must conform to the 
requirements for the listed classification.  Vessels may be armed or unarmed, 
depending on mission.  The standard classifications in Imperial service are:
Shuttle, 100 tons displacement
Fuel Skimmer, 400 tons displacement
Cutter, 50 tons displacement
Pinnace, 40 tons displacement
Ship\'s Boat, 30 tons displacement
Launch, 10 tons displacement
Gig, 20 tons displacement

How about me waiting to see what\'s in T4?  I\'m sure the Task System is
going to get an overhaul, and what I\'ve got are my varient of TNE\'s.
I\'ll have to get them ready to send out to players in the PBEM game

When I say we had all read the trilogy, I was referring to Asimov\'s

	My good friend Gord has just mentioned an interesting idea
regarding the problem of "how much of 20th century culture will be
remembered in 5700 AD".  The realistic answer is simply to say: "not
much".  But then you lose all sorts of cool opportunities to name ships
things like the Arthur C. Clarke or the Crazy Horse.  And you lose all
sorts of other opportunities to make neat allusions and references. 
Gord\'s suggested solution is simply to assume that when you have an
anachronistic allusion (or reference), it alludes to (or refers to) a
contemporary equivalent.  E.g., a ship named Crazy Horse is not really
named after a native american from 3000 years ago (who would probably not
be remembered by many in the 57th century), but is named after someone
closer to 5700 who falls into a similar sort of archetype and who\'s name
evokes the same conotations. 
	Of course, the ideal solution is to come up with background 
materials so rich and so deep that you don\'t even _need_ 20th century 
references, cuz you\'ve got enough from your own future history.  But 
that\'s a lot of work :-).

I grant you this...but then again, I\'ve always found Virus as

The navy, and a covert courier business that carried messages 
independent of the xboat service for use by the navy and upper 
nobility.  They went under the name of Imperiallines.  They operated 
identical looking Jump 2 and Jump 6 ships.  They were the major form 
of communication on high priority matters between the Emperor, the 
Dukes & Archdukes, and Naval high command.  They were operated 
clandestinely as a group of tramp freighter ships under a variety of 
names in various sectors of the Imperium, but their main purpose was 
as a cover for a fleet of covert J6 message couriers...

When Strephon\'s clone was assassinated, the news reached Norris and 
others by Jump 6 couriers under the name Imperiallines long before 
the message reached the plebes via xboat...

For more information on Imperiallines, check out the section on them 
in the CT campaign, The Traveller Adventure...

I would moderate my position slightly with regard to milieu zero.  My
original posting was referring to the New Era, and I would stand by
my assertions fully in regard to that.  I do feel that even in Milieu 0 the
history and pop culture of the US would be less important than you
believe.  The twin foundations of \'Western Culture\' have for centuries
been defined as the culture of the Greeks and Romans.  These
cultures are far  more important to our development on this small
world than that of one nation of a balkanised world in an Imperium
of many many others, large numbers of whom owe their culture and
history to the Vilani, not the Solomani.

Even many citizens of the Imperium with Solomani roots will feel that
they owe their allegiance, history and culture to their home planet,
not to where their gene stock originally came from.  We are all
descended from Mitochondrial Eve who bounced about the
Kenyan or Tanzanian plains at some point - how many of us owe
our sense of identity to Africa, rather than the US, UK, Canada or
elsewhere?

Simply because the US is the dominant power, and American pop
culture is to a large extent world culture at the present, doesn\'t mean
that this is what will pass on to our far descendents as representation
of Terran culture.  150 years ago Great Britain was THE dominant
world power, with perhaps greater (certainly more direct) sway over
the world than the US has now.  Now we are a small, reasonably
successful island state, with an international importance that probably
owes more to our past than our present, and a lot of mad cows.

150 years before that the Spanish and the Dutch were major world
powers, etc etc.  I would expect any Terran popular culture which
passes on into the future firstly to be mutated almost beyond
recognition, and secondly to owe its origins to a polyglot, polycultural
world.

I would still argue that any histories of Terra taught to non-specialists
would concentrate on Terra\'s role after first contact, and would be unlikely
to delve into the early presidents of one of its nations (which is where
this thread started).  Of course, future history is probably likely to prove
us all wrong. ("Few 20th century analysts could have predicted the
amazing rise to world domination of the Glorious Belgian Empire, and
the rapid Belgification of global culture..")

Nicholas van Rijn, who is one *hell* of a trader. He also has a bunch
about a team of traders (David Falkyn, Chee Lan and Adzel) working for
van Rijn. Titles that come to mind are "The Man Who Counts" and
"Satan\'s World". These two sets of stories and related ones are lumped
together as "stories of the Poleotechnic League" (that\'s the "league"
of traders and merchants that pretty much run things, they are
supposedly based somewhat on the Hanseatic League of medieval times)

He also has a bunch of stories set much later in time, involving mostly
a character named Dominic Flandry and Terran Empire, which Flandry
works for.

Plus he has lots of other stuff, much of which may be useful.

Andre Norton\'s sf is a *must*, she has a *lot* stuff that\'ll work just
fine. A fair amount of trading, exploration, and adventure. Not much
military. 

A. Bertram Chandler has a lot of stuff, though the technology is
different enough to make things hard to use.

More likely they\'ll award mail contracts to ships willing to maintain
the required schedule. A mail contract will provide a steady (if small)
income, and tend to indicate that your ship is reliable. 

I rather expect that the contract or contracts would be such that you
aren\'t spending every other week in jump. I\'d rather expect that the
contract would be more along the lines of one trip a month. 

Jump in. Spend a couple of weeks seeing if you can line up cargo, and
then jump back. The contract would pay enough to cover your expenses
and maintenance (unless you got into a bidding war with another ship),
so any cargo or passengers are pure profit. 

Of course you have to make sure that you don\'t haul anything thazt
endangers the mail, and worry about passengers (or pirates) who want to
steal the mail.

The folks with the Doomsday weapons had no need to use them. Nobody
bothered the Darrians or the Zhodani, so they didn\'t use theirs. And
the rest is no more unlikely than the fact that we haven\'t* fought a
nuclear war so far.

I was a bit young to understand the Cuban missile crisis, but I do
remember them sending us home to see how long it took, so they\'d know
which kids could be sent home and which would have to use the fallout
shelter at the school. 

When I was older, I remember seeing a *very* bright flash just the
other side of the hills (must have been heat lightning) and wondering
if it was the airbase out there being nuked. 

Real history is just as unbelievable as this scenario. Really.

A doomsday device isn\'t much good unless the other side *knows* you
have it. That way they won\'t try attacks that fail and waste your time
and resources trashing them.

As for using a nuke, I got the impression that someone has to teleport
*with* anything that is sent. And since the amplifier is back on their
ship, they can\'t port back.

I suggest that you sit down and figure out just how *much* food is
required to support a 9 or A pop. Then figure out how much shipping
that\'d take. It basically boild down to the fact that worlds with large
populations *must* be self-sufficient with regards to food. Of course,
if the recycling gear breaks....

Not easily. 

What they\'d be doing is mining moons of the gas giants, and looking for
comets, icy bodies in the outer system, and carbonaceous chonridites.

They can get oxygen from any icy body, as well as some nitrogen and
carbon if it has ammonia or methane ice. But carbonaceous chondrites
are the best source of nitrogen, carbon and "organics".

I\'m *certain* that WWII tech levels are sufficient to maintain a
civilization in an asteroid belt or airless world, as long as they had
access to icy bodies in the outer system. 

WWI tech *might* be able to do it. And mid-to-late 1800s tech would be
about the limit. 

But for work in the outer system, you really need either *huge* amounts
of fuel, or you need at least radio-isotope power packs, if not nuclear
reactors. (Radio-isotope power packs use the heat from the decay of
short lived isotopes to generate electricity)

I hope everyone found it as useful.  Working in a shipyard, especially a
shipyard that does military work, I could see incredible potential for
running a ship construction campaign.  Of course, I wouldn\'t want to run a
shipyard in an RPG, but to be on the other end, where the shipyard was
building my ship...I think that could be very enjoyable!!

The two types are basically the same.  Frame construction basically starts
with the internal structure, that is, the angle, channel, and beams, and
adds the components and the hull plating to this frame, hence (I\'ve alwayse
wanted to use that word) the name Frame construction.

Hull construction begins with the hull plating, held in place with gravtic
tech and/or minimal internal structure.  To this basic hull is added the
necessary internal structure to hold up under the necessary G\'s and the
necessary other components.  This design is particularly helpful when some
of the components (ie J6) are secret military components and will not be
added untill after the vessel is delivered.

Neither of these types of construction are really used now, I postulated
them based on near zero-G shipyards (in both cases, the frame and the hull
would likely collapse under gravity without the complete support of the other).

Most shipyards currently use a variation on the modular construction.  Most
begin with a hull and do most of the component, hull (fore, aft, and side),
and internal structure, one level at a time.  Typically the construction
begins at the bidbody, and while crews are working on the lowest level for
and aft, other crews are working on the next level midbody.  Naturally due
to delivery schedules and such, not all of the components will necessarily
be ready when the section is being worked on.  In these cases, the part or
material is simply added later.  

Hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

Exactly. And it\'s worse than that. You can\'t trust *anything* (at least
not completely) if it\'s been laying around unprotected. Suppose Virus
altered a screwdriver by inserting a silicon core and placing an "egg"
inside it. It can\'t do anything to you normally, but what if you try
to use it to pry up a chip (or the 57th century equivalent?). If it
can physically move to the chip, you\'re in deep guano. Especially if
you were removing the chip to put it in your starship.

That example is a bit contrived and pushing believability (even with
the silicon lifeform concept), but what about this: Virus similarly
infects a piece of wire so that it detects when it is on a "secure"
computer connection and infects the computers then.

I think this is the type of scary scenario you have alluded to in
the past. Virus changed the rules and people could not adapt fast
enough. Now it is not enough to have a "safe" hand computer, you
also have to be *very* careful if you ever take it apart, fix it,
change the batteries, etc. :-)

Actually, the USSR never spent 60% of GNP on their military.  1 of 
the things that was debunked when the Soviet Union collapsed was how 
much money was spent on their military...  The CIA & DOD found it to 
be a lot less than they supposed...  Then again the USSR had a whole 
lot less to spend...

or Traveller, is the prime cause of inability to maintain "suspension 
of disbelief".  As someone else pointed out, what works in Regina 
should work in Core; what works with jumpdrives should work with  
powerplants.   
     (A.1) Be aware of the implications of your technology. 
     (A.2) Human beings should act like real human beings, unless 
           you have a very good explanation for them acting abnormally. 
     (A.3) [PET PEEVE] Technology that exists RIGHT NOW should not be 
           regarded as a rare, expensive, experimental technolgy of  
           several tech levels higher! 
     (A.4) Any technology that has been in use for the last 10,000 years 
           has no real surprises left. (e.g. gravitics, jump drive, fusion,

           lasers, cold sleep) 
 
>Exactly...much more important than splitting hairs and trying to  
>break down basic assumptions.  In present day terms, none of this  
>stuff really works, after all... 
 
(B) The Defense Department projects that have been working on weapons- 
grade lasers and particle weapons for the last 20 years will be real 
surprised to hear that, I\'m sure.  So will the guys running the nuclear 
powerplants around the world... And I\'m really surprised to find out 
that the computer I\'m typing this on doesn\'t work, nor does the network 
it\'s hooked up to.  How are you reading this, anyway? 
 
Point being, a lot of the Traveller technology is based on real-world 
engineering; the main exceptions are Jump and Gravitics.  (We\'re 
working on Fusion now... I expect we\'ll have that, or something 
totally unexpected, within 30 years.) Make sure the fictional versions 
aren\'t *less* capable than the Real World versions! (See A.3, above). 
 
(C) Yes, we do have the technology to build a base on the Moon. It 
requires some engineering development, but no fundamental breakthroughs. 
Ditto for a manned Mars mission, and Mars colonization.  And orbital 
habitats. And a number of other things that someone said weren\'t currently 
possible. 
 
Note that "politically & economically feasible" are not the same 
as "technologically impossible".

Yeah, I remember you. I was going to put some of your stuff into Challenge,
but you know what happened to all of that.

Imperium Games has asked me via Loren Wiseman to write just such a TNE "Wrap
Up" project as you mention. I have told them I want to do so, but have not
heard back from them now in over a month. Do not know why.

Perhaps if enough Traveller fans pester them and make their lives miserable
until they get back to me, something will happen.

Until I hear something from them, it is premature to spill beans elsewhere.

Hi, Dave!  (In case you don\'t remember me, I sent some papers to you on
deep-space refueling for the RC in TNE, as well as some other stuff.)  I\'m
writing to say "Hi" and to see how you\'re doing.

Will you be joining onto the Traveller mailing lists (traveller@mpgn.com,
xboat@mpgn.com) ?

Remember when DGP stopped covering MegaTraveller?  In their last issue,
they gave us their insider info on the Sparklers/"Baddies at the Core".
I was wondering, would you care to do this for the Black Curtain and/or
the Empress Wave, sort of "tie up the loose ends" for those of us who  
would like to know?  If so, are you going to do this as an article for the
Traveller Chronicle or for the new JTAS?  Just wondering; I, for one,
would like to know the full story on these.

Thanks.  I hope you are doing well.

Of course this pretty much leaves your options wide open, since human 
beings are capable of lust, greed, paranoia, prejudice, etc, etc, as 
well as selfless acts of generosity, kindness, love, etc...  
Sometimes motivated by more than 1 thing...

It should be when its still at the experimental stage...which 
technology are we talking about?  Fusion?

Actually, technology that has been in use for that long does that all 
the time now.  Things fail...things break down...  Granted, a cold 
sleep capsule has to have the same sort of things go wrong with it 
consistently...it won\'t discover new and interesting ways to fail 
that aren\'t consistent with its engineering...

Yeah, they\'ve had a whole lot of practical applications in the 
field...  I remember all those particle weapons and lasers they used 
in the Gulf War after all.  Yes, we are closer to those sort of 
applications than Traveller postulates, and I will be the first to 
admit that the old Tech Level tables do cry out for an 
overhaul...which it sounds like they\'ll be getting in the new 
edition...

As far as nuclear power plants and particle weapons, they\'re not 
exactly man portage-able are they, you can\'t exactly miniaturize 
them enough to throw 1 in a Coast Guard Cutter...let alone wear 
one with a backpack on your shoulder...

And even if what you are saying is true...particle weapons and lasers 
in real world terms...ARE expensive, rare, and experimental...  
Otherwise, you\'d see more practical application of them... 
  
On the other hand, I remember hearing just the other day about 
lasers being shipped to Israel...to knock down missiles...

Are you talking nuclear fission or fusion???  If somebody had a breakthrough
in fusion, how come I haven\'t read about it???  You think somebody 
would have said something about it.  Fission isn\'t all that 
spectacular...we\'ve been doing that for 40+ years now, but its not 
quite the same thing...

As for your comments on computers, give me a friggin\' break...  Yes, 
obviously computers work...but computers that are close to 
self-aware?  We are still in the stone age as far as artificial 
intelligence goes...though not as much as a few years ago.  I don\'t think 
we\'ve come that far yet...  Maybe we\'ll reach that plain a lot quicker than 
Traveller postulates, then again, maybe not...Moore\'s law can\'t run forever...
at some point there will be diminishing returns in new computer technology...
just as there is in every field of engineering...

Obviously, the CT computer rules are a greybeard, and really no 
edition of the game has handled computers all that well...

True enough...  But even according to Traveller, fusion is the next 
big step...  This seemed reasonable enough in \'77 when the first 
edition of the rules came out, and it does now as well...

Your points about real vs. fictional in terms of capability are good 
though...

That was me...

Obviously we are close on orbital habitats, but to make such things 
long-term, you have to have a breakthrough in gravitics that we\'re 
not even approaching.  The effects of long-term weightlessness are 
well documented...

Mars, I question...  Any spacecraft we\'ve built wouldn\'t have the 
combination of endurance and life support to carry a man to Mars...  
I contend that the aforementioned breakthrough in fusion is going to 
need to happen before this does...  Actually, the space shuttle is not 
even engineered to take men to the moon...

True enough...

This might be possible if the screwdriver had a silicon core and a 
powersource and was somehow hooked into screwdriver blade, but that\'s 
going pretty far.  Virus would have to be really thinking to do something 
like this, I\'d put something like this in the 0.00000000000000000000001% 
probablity scale.

I don\'t think it could infect wire, as far as I know it can only infect 
chips.  The problem is if you need a TI 441-B chip and you know that the 
portacomp laying at your feet has one, do you trust that chip?  Is Virus 
hiding in that chip?  Or perhaps in one of the other chips in the 
portacomp.  This is where things get scarry.

See at the point in Vampire Fleets where we are I\'m still storing data on 
that Virus Infected Portacomp.  Plus I have a pocket full of Virus 
Infected CPU\'s, okay they\'re carefully stored in a pack.  Why am I still 
using the portacomp inspite of the fact i know it\'s infected?  Because I 
also know it was infected by what I consider a fairly benign strain of 
Virus, "Archer" and because I know there isn\'t anything that the Virus in 
my portacomp can do to hurt me, there\'s not enough processing power in 
the portacomp for it to attain sentience and even if it did it\'d be 
stupid to come out and say, "Hey I\'m Infected!"  Just inviting self 
termination.

Hence all the data I\'ve collected on Virus, it\'s activities and Promise 
in contained ironically in a Virally infected computer.

You might find the book "High Frontiers" by Gerard K. O\'Neill of 
interest.  It is *the* classic on the subject.  He was writing 
about building PERMANENT habitats *before* the end of the 20th  
century, and not by hoping for a breakthrough in gravitics. You 
build them large, and SPIN them for simulated "gravity". 
 
>Mars, I question...  Any spacecraft we\'ve built wouldn\'t have the

That\'s because we didn\'t build them to go for Mars.  Read 
Werner Von Braun\'s original proposal, from back in the 1950s. 
NASA has been studying the manned Mars mission problem seriously 
for some years now--it probably has a web page somewhere. 
 
In short: if you build it in orbit, you can build it as large 
as you need to do the job...

Uh, you did notice that we landed men on the Moon long before 
the shuttle was built?  :-)  It\'s just a matter of building 
the spacecraft to do the job--we know how to do it already. 
 
I think you\'re also forgetting space solar power as an unlimited 
power source inside the orbit of Jupiter or thereabouts.

Granted...  It may be more of a case of political will holding this 1 
back than technology...But I think there would be some technical 
hurdles to cross before this one would be feasible...

On the other hand, I will be truly surprised if it doesn\'t happen 
within the next 50 years...  I hope I live to see it... :-)

Saw a bit about why\\why not we can go to Mars and the moon, so I thought I\'d
add my two cents.

I basically think the reason the space program hasn\'t made that many great
leaps recently, and why the space station project is continuely being pushed
back and cut in funding is two factors:

1)  The USA is now more concerned with domestic problems that with space
exploration and scientific research.  I remember my brother doing a school
project on NASA\'s budget vs. Military earlier this year, and NASA gets
something like half a cent out of each dollar, while USA military gets 10-20
cents.  I\'ll try and dig up the exact figures and post them.

2)  The collapse of the USSR.  They were always high on doing lots of space
explorations, and sometimes basically ignoring their populace.  While this
may not have been the best of ways to explore space, they still got a lot
done, look at the various space stations, etc.  Now, they can sometimes not
even afford to get their cosmonauts down from the space stations, let alone
build new ones.

Also, with a base on the moon, a lot of people say "what\'s the point?".
Indeed, what is the point of a base on the moon?  What does everyone think?
I basically have this idea:

First of all, a base on the moon would be a major step in our exploration of
space, sort of a rallying point for space exploration, perhaps getting more
people, and more importantly, more money into the programs.  Secondly, I
think that it may be feasible to build a launch site on the moon.  If ships
were to take off from their they wouldn\'t need nearly as muchg fuel due to
the lower gravity of the Moon.  That way, less money would have to spent on
fuel, and also, as an added bonus, the space launches wouldn\'t pollute the
atmosphere of aour planet!

That\'s all I have to say, don\'t know how this relates to Traveller, but....

Thanks,

Granted, but such a habitat is going to consume a LOT of 
energy...is current solar power technology going to do it???  I can\'t 
answer this one either way...

True...hadn\'t considered the orbit option, but then again, first you 
have to build the infrastructure to build something from orbit...back 
to your comment about economic and political considerations...

Yes, but you are looking at several orders of magnitude in the 
difference in distance between the Moon and Mars...  We could have 
probably sent the Apollo lander to Mars...but the crew would have 
been dead for lack of oxygen before we could get it there...

I have to admit you\'ve persuaded me.  It\'s more an engineering 
problem than a technical problem...  On the other hand, its even more 
of a political problem than either one...

Hardly unlimited...  Diminishing with each step you take towards Mars...  Solar 
sails or panels can only be built so big in proportion to the craft, after 
all...

There are 3 fairly important factors, i think, beyond those already

first, NASA is trying to find inexpensive ways to explore space (vis a 
vis inexpensive mars robots, and so forth, built from largely standard 
parts..)  (saw some of this on discover..if i could only remember the 
program...:)

next, there is a general movement (in our society, and especiall in nasa) 
to make it nearly risk-proof...space exploration is a *very* risky 
proposition...the apollo missions were nowhere near as safe as they would 
be made today (:wonders if they would even be attempted today..*sigh*)

and last, and not the least by anymeans, is a general division amonst the 
supporters of nasa as to what the next big thing should be.  Should it be 
an orbital space station, or a moon base, or a trip to mars? should we be 
working on vtol rockets, or orbital rockets to move things into orbit..what?

Lots of great and wonderful ideas, yet no single one has captured the 
american imagination like the moon did (and well, kennedy was largely the 
force there, i believe..)

Yep. Many times on alt.gothic, I\'ve said that "Americans are 
so afraid of death, they\'d outlaw it if they could".  As it 
is, have you ever noticed the number of laws and regulations 
whose purpose is to protect you from any risk whatsoever, no 
matter the cost in freedom or trivial things like that... 
 
ObTML: So, will this trend worsen in the Far Future (tm), or 
reverse itself somewhere along the line?  I can see the Vilani 
culture being much like Niven\'s "Safe at Any Speed" era,  
and any kind of risk-taking behavior would be considered 
"abnormal", "unhealthy", or even criminal.   
I see the Terran/Solomani culture treating risk-taking as 
a normal, even desirable facet of human behavior.

    'body' => '	I was mucking about with QDS again (actually, checking to make sure
the archive copies of my other designs had indeed been upgraded to
QDS 1.1) and came up with a design for a Scout Trader.  What is a
Scout Trader? essentially it\'s a little bigger than a Far trader, and
is designed to be sent out into the \'wilds\', to poke around and maybe
pick up some interesting stuff.  These ships are typically the second
wave of exploration, after the scouts.  These are the people who
actually see what trade is out there; as such they\'re strictly
speculative ships, and are probably run at a loss by their corporate,
mercantile union, or Sylean Confederation owners.

The Van Rijn class Scout/Trader (Thanks, Leonard, for reminding me of 
Nicolas\' last name, I\'d been racking my brains for it)

Tons 300 	Volume 282	Cost 150.7 (113) mCr
Crew  6    	Pass H/M 0/4*	Low 0
Cargo 75.9	Controls Fib	TL 12

Size 8      	Jump 2		Manuever 3G
Civ. Laser 	2-0-0-0   	 	Power Plant 460
				Fuel  62 /s/r
				Sandcaster 1 (30)
				Sensors A10 P4 J10
				Armor 20
				Stucture 12 (Disc S)

Accomodations: 10 Sm. Staterooms
Workstations: 6 

	These ships have decent legs, and some (minimal according to you 
weapons freaks out there) armament.  However, their mission is to 
approach worlds, often for the first time, on a friendly basis, and 
initiate trade.  They\'ll not want to spook potential trading 
partners, so they\'ll make sure flight is their first response.

	Of course they can\'t duke it out with some of those heavily armed 6 
G SDB\'s everyones been making, but these don\'t go into systems where 
the scouts think there is a heavily armed presence....that\'s the job 
of the Sylean Navy.

	Of course, as I see it, the scouts don\'t often land on a world in a 
first survey...they\'ll pop into a system, take pictures and pop out.  
The Scout Traders will often come in next, if the natives seem 
friendly.

	The Scouts only go \'to ground\' in situations where the politics 
require it, such as when a world is suspected as a threat, and more 
intel is needed to identify or eliminate the threat.

I agree about the tech going back as far as Victorian levels, as long
as we\'re talking about the civilization staying out of gravity wells
greater than..oh say, 1/5g.  If they have to boost onto an off more
massive bodies they\'re going to need to maintain proportionally higher
tech levels.

In the inner system solar-thermal and solar-electric could provide you
with the thrust and power you need to move around, to generate
electricity, process and recycle air/water/etc.  You\'d need a pretty
good grasp on chemistry and mineral processing too.

I\'m not sure they\'d ever have to go into the outer system.  If the
system was similar to ours there would be millions of small bodies
orbiting in the inner system, and they would be about to get to an
asteroid belt too.  With all that material and the capture of an
occasional comet they would probably have enough without *ever* going
into "the great cold..the dark forever."

The outer system is a different story.  Out beyond 4 or 5AU, solar
power is *much* more problematic, collectors become huge!  For
propulsion you *might* be able to use something like Magsails, cutting
down on fuel needs.  For power I think you are right..at least
radio-isotope power packs, and very likely fission reactors.

BTW, Mars would qualify as an airless world in our system.  However,
there are *almost* surely enough volitiles locked in the soil to
support a good population..if they can mine it, crack out and capture
the gases.  Could you maintain a civilization on Mars without outside
resource input (except solar of course)...if it is a matter of life or
death I\'d guess you could.

I liked the TC #10, especially becauase of the Sol Rim stuff. I have
always liked the Solomani especially when DGP came out with Rats &
Cats.  The idea that they were the masters of genetics, and geneering
really appealled to me. 
The thought of sapient dolphins, apes, and other animals was really
cool. I have always had the picture in my head of a lowland gorilla in
battle dress with a FGMP.   I really liked the David Brin books that
use sapien dolphins and chimps.

Anyway that brings me to a question for Harold. In the introduction,
you mentioned more details about the dolphins and Vegans.  Is this
detail going include character generation rules.  I have the Best of
JTAS issue where they
talk about Dolphins, but the rules for generation, are based on animal
rules, so they aren\'t that useful for players or NPCs.

Honestly, my Imperial citizen winds up in a society much more similar to the 
Roman Empire of 200 AD than that of 1996 AD New York.  However, unless you have 
a group of players with the time, education and skills to truly roleplay people 
from such a society, you will have a PC group of 20th-century characters.  The 
reality is that cultural biases and influences are deeply ingrained in all of 
us.  Many of us can get beyond them for some period of time, but they are 
always there, waiting for the right moment to make themselves known.  I get a 
great deal of enjoyment out of playing in or running a game where people have 
the time, skills and knowledge to pull off such a "deculturalization," but that 
does not always happen.  That does not mena that playing an rpg (not even 
Traveller necessarily) with 20th-century cultural assumptions is a bad thing; 
you can still present the players with socieities and situations foreign to 
their normal assumptions, and base your adventures on their reactions.

I was talking with a role-player friend of mine about the "Imperial citizen as 
20th-Century American" issue, and he pointed out something I had not previously 
considered.  If you have a Traveller campaign where Imperial citizens travel 
from world to world and spend a reasonable amount of time at each new world, 
you get a great opportunity for an "Innocents Abroad" style of campaign.  In 
effect, the PCs are playing themselves, and are confronting very unusual, 
different and decidedly non-20th century US societies.  The reactions of your 
players are real reactions, going beyond simple roleplay assumption.

As for role-playing in medieval Japan, Glorantha or other "foreign" settings, 
the truth is that, unless you have a 15th-century Samurai in your group, 
chances are your players are playing 20th-century characters, or 20th-century 
stereotypes of what 15th Century Japan was like.   That\'s the fun part 
sometimes.  The Western aspects of Traveller are artifacts of the Western 
nature of its authors.  One thing that is sadly true in RPGs is that the 
foreign or unusual cultural backgrounds (Empire of the Petal Throne is one of 
my favorites, BTW) do not sell well in the US, and when you are looking to get 
90% of your revenues from US sales, well...

Why must the game resemble 20th century USA?  There is no requirement that it 
must; in CT and MT there was not very much about the "culture" of Imperial 
society, and you had a good deal of leeway in how you really operated the 
overall society.  In TNE this was also true; most cultural focus was on 
individual worlds in the Reformation Coalition, many of which were very 
un-American in outlook and demeanor.  There are USA-centric cultural influences 
that crop up; some of them are subtle and interesting, and some are obtuse and 
annoying.  As a student of history, though, I have seen a lot of non-American 
references in there as well.   Some of the cultures and societies seem to be 
strongly based on non-Western civilizations of the past and present, and little 
odd bits poke out from time to time even in references to Imperial society.

Basically, I just run the society as I see fit, within the bounds of the 
minimal info presented.  Some of the more interesting adventure ideas have come 
from having bits of detail from GDW appear that seem at odds with the 
established campaign; resolving it becomes an adventure or more.  When a lot of 
detail shows up and I don\'t like it, I either move the campaign elsewhere or 
ignore the info I don\'t like.  GDW and IG may have canon, but I have cannon 
(and other weapons) on my side.

Where do these numbers come from? High Guard may very well have sold
200,000 copies, but 20,000 is low for all MT products combined. The
figure of 2000 for all TNE products combined is ludricrously low.

Oh, I don\'t know.  Working in a shipyard could be fun for an adventure or 
two...depending on what the referee and player(s) want to make of it. :)  
Any job could be fun that way.  The old everyworker wish of getting back

I agree.  Heck, if they wanted to do a bit of research, they could pass 
off many Earth-cultures as alien, since most people know little about 
cultures other than their own.

Loren,

Would it be possible that what was actually referred to was the quantity 
sold of High Guard, MT\'s ship design rules (boxed set or individual 
book), and FF&S (again, in the boxed set, or sold by itself)?  The 
concern seemed to be the quantity of each set of ship design rules that 
was sold, as opposed to the total quantity of material for each edition 
of Traveller.

Does that make the numbers seem more accurate?

I\'ll bet that the Zhodani don\'t have any problems with insider trading.

This is a big problem.  Sometimes I just ignore it when I referee or play.
If all of the participants are willing to speak in the appropriate dialect,
however, role-playing is greatly enhanced.  When the dialect has to be
imagined, and has to incorporate future social and technological changes,
it\'s very hard to do (much harder than being the berserk Irish dwarf that
one friend always played in D&D).  

Alfred Bester\'s The Stars My Destination handles gutter patois very well,
using plain English words with slight grammatical twists to convey a
different dialect (Me, preaching language, is all.  Listen up, or don\'t.)
The Star My Destination has just been reissued; I recommend it.  Another
well-known resource is Anthony Burgess\' A Clockwork Orange, but he found it
necessary to include a glossary.

That precludes the Imperial family from taking profits.  The only way that
the family could profit then would be by holding only preferred stock that
paid substantial dividends.  

The market manipulation implicit in such customs would also allow the
Imperial family to destabilize the securities markets.  Maybe that\'s not a
problem -- after, the Emperor is an autocrat.  (Noble #1:  "I hear that
Strephon\'s taking a hundred million share short position in Instellarms."
Noble #2:  "Maybe he knows something we don\'t -- we\'d better dump our
holdings, too."  Noble #3:  "Well, my broker is EF Hutton, LIC ....")

Of course, we don\'t know the extent of the Imperial family\'s holdings of
debt securities.  I suspect that those holdings are comparable to the
family\'s equity positions.

This is the sort of thing I was trying to achieve with my Java page. Eventually 
(I hope to get started some time soon) it will guide the creation of the entire 
ship using the SSDS rules. It currently does the hulls - please have a look and 
tell me if it fits the sort of thing you were thinking of.

Yeah, I think I might occasionally enjoy that type of roleplay, but seeing
the way the bosses (note the plural) kiss up (we\'re talking BIG time) to the
customers, I think I could get much more enjoyment out of being on the
receiving end of such suck-up-ness from my boss!  Just think, even if you
got to tell your boss off, how much fun would it be to play a PC who did the
same thing for a living that you did?  A very short (we\'re talking hour or
two including combat) session with the boss, and I\'d be through.  Hey, come
to think of it, I might just create me and my boss into T4 characters when
it comes out, and practice the combat rules for a while!  Heh Heh Heh!

>Ah, I get it now.  Thanks for the explanation.

Glad to help.  If that was your only question, I must\'ve done a better job
at explaining than I thought.  Either that, or I totally confused everyone.
I have a tendancy to do one or the other, but I seldom ride the middle ground.

>changes you mentioned.

OK, here they are:

After the Formula for Tc, the next paragraph begins, "To this figure, add
0.16...."  replace this to the end of the "Where: Tt=" part with the following:

"Next, compute the time required for trials before delivery.  The trial time
begins with the shipyard asigning crewmen to test the various facilities
that can be tested before the actual trials begin.  This test will ensure
all staterooms are functioning, the life support and back-up systems work,
the bridge systems work, etc.  This initial phase, dry-dock testing takes up
most of the testing time, it is followed by a flight test where the systems
are tested as they actually perform during a test flight.  The total trial
time can be computed as follows:


          Tt=((P*10)/D)/12

  Where:  Tt = Trial time in years
           P = Price in MCr
           D = Diaplacement Tons"


This should fix the error in the previous formula, and should more realistic
trial times.  Also, I\'ve checked these formula against a number of hulls in
the BL book, and they seem to be right.  I\'m gonna try them against some
small (under 100 ton) ships tonight, and if anyone has large ships (over
5000 tons) please send the Disp, Price, and Name/Type of ship to me so I can
check the numbers.  I\'m not real comfortable with the numbers on the few I
have (from BL and World Tamers Handbook) and would like to try some others.


Thanks, hope you enjoy!

20th Century Fox has already commited themselves to the development of a 
"Son of ID4", or is that "Bride of ID4."  The writer\'s would love to do 
this however they say that before a serious sequel can be made they\'ll 
have to come up with a really good plot idea.  Stress on the "REALLY 
GOOD"  20th C wants it out in time for 98.  Sounds like they want to 
really tie up the Sci-Fi Market in 98.  It\'ll be an interesting summer, 
and next summer looks hot too.

Actually, this has already been done.  I recall 1 of the Keith

Personally, I think you do what Kennedy did...  Fire \'em up with the 
prospect of a Mars mission...or a moon colony...  Maybe do it under a 
UN aegis, and get a few other countries to contribute...hail it as a 
"New Era of Cooperation in Space"

And you could make the ship\'s computer be self-aware and name it 
Hal... (OOPS, I got carried away...)  :-)

Seriously though, NASA hasn\'t done much of anything since the launch 
of the 1st space shuttle that is really going to capture the public\'s 
imagination...  Right now, there isn\'t a whole lot being done in the space 
program that I find inspiring...and I get excited over that kind of 
stuff...

Heck, the Russians are doing more interesting stuff than we are...  
At least they have a station up...  NASA has basically turned the space 
shuttle into an overpriced rocket for launching satellites...or at least 
that\'s the public view of it...

Don\'t underestimate the fear of the Russians...  I wasn\'t alive then, 
but the twin scares of Sputnik and the Cuban Missile Crisis were a 
call to arms for the space program.  Kennedy just saw an opportunity 
to make hay while the sunshines with the Moon missions...

rolling in quite as inspirational a manner as he managed to...

Joe, you\'re too soft a referee.  In my universe, the PCs would breathe a big
sigh of relief that they\'d disengaged by jumping, and had no indication of
misjump.  Then instead of a quick week to wherever, they\'d have to role-play
the nightmare of alarms, electronic failures, and mysterious medical
problems, which, coupled with the zillion surface hits taken in the fight,
would lead them to conclude that the jump grid wasn\'t functioning quite
right.  Then they\'d have to trace and repair it, or at least mark off the
holes where j-space might -- or might not -- be reaching in.  

In my universe, exposure to jump space screws up electromagnetic activity.
It doesn\'t stop it, but scrambles it unpredictably.  The results are
predictable, however:  The first things to go would be the sensitive
electromagnetic processes of neural activity. This is manifested in vomiting
and cramping; then hallucinations and synesthesia; then death as the
autonomic nervous system stops reminding the lungs and heart to work.  Next,
the computers and other electronics would short out, burn, shut down, or
whatever (roll d6).  The light bulbs would blow out at some point, too (at
least on TL7 or lower ships).

I think that it\'s to make it more realistic.  Since I turned 30 (almost a

Scene:  Attorneys\' meeting at Led & Water (plaintiffs\' counsel in
above-referenced case):

Eneri Led (name partner):  What\'s the status of the In re Tukera Lines case?

Pavel Daavi (junior partner):  Defendants are producing fifty terabytes of
internal communications and such crap for our review, and I\'m sending
Smithers with some robots to go through it.  They\'ve also moved to change
venue from Capital/Core to someplace in Diaspora.  Patterjee and Shamaagin
are working on the brief; we\'ve filed an opposition to their motion to
increase the page limit to 500.  The most important thing going on, however,
is that our investigator has located Winitka Tukusagi, the former chief
financial officer, on Feri in the Spinward Marches.  Because she\'s gone to
ground on a world run by one of Tukera\'s major competitors in that market,
we can surmise that she\'s willing to talk to us.  I\'ve sent two of our
better associates to interview her and bring her back here for a deposition.

Led:  Which associates?

Daavi:  These two [gesturing at the PCs]:  Morgenstern, ex-Imperial naval
intelligence instructor, and Changling, who quit the Foreign Ministry to
work for us.  If they can\'t get the evidence out of Tukusagi --

Led:  then we\'ll have to do it ourselves! hahaaaha!

Check with Kevin Knight, who produces the Traveller Chronicle.  He sells
out-of-print Traveller stuff (all eras), and I\'ve gotten some nice
miniatures from him.

Keep an eye out for Laserburn 15mm science fiction figures and vehicles.
This was a British company, I think.  The workmanship and detail are very
nice.  Laserburn was in production in the early 1980s.

I\'ve heard that Citadel made Traveller 25mm figures in the early 80s, as
well, but I\'ve never seen them.

I\'m assuming that\'s the subject of the first sequel:  Labor Day.  Labor Day
follows (1) military units charged with hunting down the survivors and
bringing them somewhere for interrogation; (2) scientists figuring out how
to build new ships; and (3) telepaths and lawyers interrogating the prisoners.

Then:  Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving tells the story of the first human interstellar vehicle,
cobbled together from wrecked invader ships, new materials, and baling wire,
and its intrepid crew, as they boldly go ...

Followed by:  Christmas
By Christmas, earth has developed a good-sized war fleet, nominally under UN
control, but with each ship actually sponsored and crewed by one major
power.  The usual problems of economics and population cause tensions to
mount, until the aliens\' second strike arrives, and everybody has to pull
together to save the earth again.

If we\'re still buying tickets, they\'ll produce: New Year\'s Day
In New Year\'s Day, the united earth fleet, with new captured ships, looks
for vengeance on the aliens\' current home world.

I haven\'t figured out what the plots of Valentine\'s Day and Presidents\' Day
will be, but I\'m sure that someone in marketing already has.

>Do the MegaCorps and others maintain their own "private" XBoat...

In I.I.S.S. Ship Files (which is probably non-canonical) there was an
Express Packet Boat built by Blistein Yards and operated by Barracai
Technum as a private/commercial communications network.  The vessel
had similar capabilities as the Imperial Xboat, and had demountable
tanks for ease of refuelling (although I\'m not sure how this fits in
with the rules.)  Oberlindes Lines operated some Patrol Cruisers
upgraded to J-5 as Line Couriers and Line Protectors.  Neither of
these systems could really do better than the Imperial Xboat system,
because neither company could justify the investment in the support
network to ensure rapid transfer - i.e. an Xboat waiting to travel
with the mail to the next system, Tenders standing by, Xmail offices
on world, etc.  The BT system offered rapid, small cargo haulage and
private message service at a special price, but it was only rapid
compared with scheduled transport.  The OL couriers were purely for
company business.  Compare with modern day: I may not be able to use
private couriers to send certain classes of mail, but there is no law
against me sending it with my own company\'s employee, and if I\'m big
enough to employ people to do only that, who is to stop me?

On a related point, has anyone ever tried to by F-16 engines; I\'m sure
you could do it easily, especially if you were using them for
commercial purposes (a fighter-technology based superfast courier?)

 I hate to point this out, but the Iowa and New Jersey are WWII era
battleships, built with the assumptino of big guns during the dawn of
carrier warefare before it totalley took over.

 See that\'s the thing, the Iowa and New Jersey are praticley the only
ships of that type in the _WORLD_, and their being decomissioned.
 Rember, that 99% of all ASM(anti ship missiles) are fragmentation, not
armour piercing. Frag wareheads do more damage then HEAT ones to a un
armored target, if people started armouring their ships everyone would
very quickley switch to HEAT warheads and then the armor would be
pointless.

 I would support maybe having a sub class for brown water operations(like
landing ships in trav), but that\'s about it.

 Does this need to be pointed out? Fighters travel in AIR, which is much
less drag friendly then water.
 And rember, that\'s not true about alot of PT boats. Few PT boats can
break 30 knots travelled by humungo carriers and the ones that do are
likley hydrophoil or non-conventional hull and suited for brown water OPs
only.

Of course if I was cynical I would argue that the CIA and DOD, and the
government in the UK knew full well that the USSR was spending less
on the military than was alleged, but for perfectly understandable
political reasons umm, forgot to mention it.

This does raise an interesting question.  When we read an account of
Imperial history, such as the posting which started this off, are we
reading the Actual God\'s Own Truth - a step out of the game which
provides an accurate account - or are we reading the perspective
on history which the average citizen of the Imperium (and therefore
most PC\'s) would have?  I seem to remember someone arguing
quite neatly on the list once that the portrayal of the Solomani as
nasty racists was just Imperial propaganda blackening the patriotic
nature of the Solomani society.

It strikes me that it would be quite neat for players to go into a
situation with certain expectations because of what they had
read, only to find those expectations confounded by reality.

I\'m glad you have.  Here in the UK we like to regard this as the
pinnacle of our cultural achievement, just pushing Benny Hill
into second place.  Shakespeare only comes 58th on the official
list as
 a) it\'s written with funny words
b) fair enough, there\'s lots of murders, but there aren\'t enough
upper middle class detectives solving them
c)His portrayal of female characters is ludicrously inadequate as
none of them run around the garden in their underwear.

Still, you did give us Saved by the Bell.  Cheers, guys.

More to the point, what happens if we rev up an Orion class ship to its

It\'s not, nor was it intended as such. From what I understand the Imperium
was originally intended to be akin to 12th and 13th century France. A weak
or distant central authority with most of the day to day power and authority
vested in the local "nobility". What it appeared to rapidly evolve into was a
society more like that of 12th and 13th century England, a semi feudal
society with a strong central government which did wield considerable
influence on the day to day lives of it\'s citizens. Just for my Cr0.03754
(at for todays exchange rates), I think either model works well as a
setting. I prefer the French model, all those petty Counts and Dukes
vying with one another within the Imperium can give endless plots
and intrigues; and not a Zhodani in sight.

>It seems obvious that there would be a *vast* diversity of cultures in the
>Imperium and most of them would look very foreign to us.

True; and despite some efforts to this end, this was sadly neglected by
GDW et al. Much effort was spent on making suitably alien alien cultures,
but very little was spent on ensuring a believable variety of human
cultures.

I see it more as marketablity. They made the culture to appeal to it\'s
primary target audience; i.e. the US and to a lesser degree the UK
and other English speaking markets.

My sincere hope for T4 is that it avoids the "It\'s another Ancient site
(or Rule of Man site)" syndrome which CT (and to a lesser extent
MT and TNE) fell into.

Speaking of the warehouse, whatever happened to whatever stock was left?
I\'m still missing a number of TNE books I\'d like to get (Vampire Fleets,

I also discovered a Challenge credit voucher (after the final day for

The Nth Interstellar War(s) and the beginning
if the Rule of Man would make an _excellent_
game setting.

The players would be mostly Solomani, giving them an
easy frame of reference to play from, for
a start.

But then - I don\'t have the book right with me,
but to paraphrase "Lieutenants were given control
of whole worlds, officers who one might have 
commanded a light crusier were put in charge of
entire fleets..." Now that would be great!
The players represent a group of solomani officers
sent to take control of some Viliani world out in
the middle of nowhere. 

I think that most of these instant military governors
would have done next to nothing - again, the "history"
states that most of the Empire was still run by the
massive Viliani buraracy (sp?), which worked fine
until society collapsed and everything ground to a halt.
Anyways, this sort of position, combined with the
real lack of anything to do could open up a lot of
cool adventure possibilities.

Anyways, the Nth Interstellar war has given me some
thoughts on the Collapse, but that\'s for another post.

I just recently loaned a copy of 2300AD but it does not have near star 
list (or what ever it is called). It has a GM book, player\'s book and star 
map. So it is quite difficult to play the game without that list.
     
I\'d like to know if some of you kind souls would e-mail me that list 
(excpesially if it is not too long to type) or a site that possibly has 
that information.
     
Thanks in advance...

I\'m glad you agree with me on that. My point was that one way to infect
new computers is to make things that *look* like wires (or more likely
connectors) which, when connected at a certain place in a computer,
infiltrate the computer and make it susceptible to an outside attack
(otherwise they work normally). People who think twice before putting a
new chip in their computer might not hesitate to connect a "wire".

You see, I never thought the Virus doomsday scenario was unbelievable,
as long as you require physical contact or a particular type of chip
on the target computer to spread the *silicon lifeform* itself (by
"physical contact" I mean touching; by "type of chip" I mean "Deyo
transponders" or "fully-adaptive silicon", not just "silicon" or
"gallium arsenide"). You also do not need to spread the lifeform to
take over computers (thus non-silicon computers may be vulnerable).
This is my "self-consistent" view of Virus.

I don\'t really want to debate the Virus issue any more. I have never
used and never intend to use Virus (or even the devastation of Hard
Times). For many, Virus was the last straw, after which they stopped
buying new Traveller products. For me, it came earlier than that.
Virus was a *good* thing, allowing GDW to rebuild a bright future
(though why they didn\'t just move the timeline forward is beyond me).
Right now, I\'m waiting to see how T4 turns out. I *am* throwing in
the occassional "Keep it consistent!" and "Don\'t try to overexplain
things that don\'t exist!" type comments, though. A corollary to the
latter is: "If you can explain something using modern-day knowledge,
don\'t make up new laws of physics instead!"

*snicker* That "30 knots" may be the "official" figure that\'s 
listed in _Jane\'s Fighting Ships_, but I\'ve heard stories that 
indicate the real "top speed" is much, much faster than 30 knots 
for the big nuke carriers.  Remember, the Jane\'s figures are jiggered; 
governments release the numbers they want their *enemies* to know.. 
One of the pecularities of hydrodynamics is that the most "efficient" 
speed is higher for a longer hull than a shorter one.  "Hull speed" 
for the USS Nimitz is a *lot* higher than the hull speed of the 
PT-109.

My Dad is an accountant for Pratt & Whitney which makes the F100 engine
which powers the F-16.  I always told him that the company should offer
employee discounts.  :)
I\'ll ask him if private individuals could purchase an engine.

And we won\'t mention the similarities between the Aslan and Shogunate 
Japan, nope, we won\'t.  Or the Solomani Confederation and the old 
Soviet Union... (the same power triad: Party, Military, Secret Police). 
I find that foriegn Earth cultures are more often thinly disguised 
and used in fantasy than in scifi, though.  Either that, or the  
scifi authors disguise the source of their cultures better.

Since it\'s a 10,000 ton ship, it would hit with the force of 1200
GIGATONS of TNT.

However, you are wrong about the ship being a 0.1c craft. I found
references to it on the web, and it was never intended to reach
those speeds. In fact, the upper limit to the velocity gain per
explosion was found to be about 30 m/s, which means it would take
at least 1,000,000 detonations to reach that speed (1,250,000 is
probably more realistic). It just can\'t carry the fuel.

It might be able to carry enough fuel to reach 0.01-0.02c, though
(gaining the energy of 10-40 gigatons of TNT!). It\'s a good thing
this is too big to be a strictly civilian venture (besides, with
10,000 tons of nuclear weapons, why bother accelerating the ship
just to create a big boom?).

I think you\'re probably correct with the latter statement...  What I want to

   AvLeak is a better source than Jane\'s. The only reason you see CVNs
cruising around at 30kts is because they have conventionally fueles
escorts. ;)

   And PT boats are only faster when they trun up the wick - which
shortens range tremendously. Even assuming PTs *are* faster, all the
CV has to do is turn around, pull the rods from the reactor and wait for
the PT to run out fo fuel chasing it.

If I remember correctly, a few months ago when I first e-mailed Marc Miller
asking whether or not the Shattered Imperium would be supported in T4 he
said yes, and also answered my other questions (Would there be an
INterstellar Wars era) with a resounding yes!

Or, players represent those Solomani scouts sent to explore the rest of the
IMperium, stumbling upon Vland, and investigating Viliani culture.

Players are Traders, and hired by the Confederation to bring Solomani goods
and people to worlds deep in the Viliani Empire.

Lastly, what if players were caught on the wrong side of the decision to
supersede Terra and the Confederation (brought about my some Admiral, name
escapes me), and had to work (albeit unsuccessfully) to bring him down.

I don\'t know about the absolutes above, but I do know that MegaTraveller,
sold less than 100 units in anchorage AK, TNE sold less than 30, and CT
Sold over 200 (I\'ve met that many people who\'ve bought it up here, courtesy
of conventions. CT still outsells MT or TNE up here. By units, I\'m
referring simply to basic sets/rulebooks.

 BTW: I account for 3 copies of MT, and 2 of TNE, and 4 of CT (Basic,
Deluxe, Traveller Book, and spare Basic). All I need now is a copy of
Starter, and a few adventures...

And what about the "infamous" Hamster cage? Use cetrifugal force to
simulate gravity. Been done since TL5-6. Really simple. Can be scaled up
easily. Set it spinning in orbit, and any cylindrical; body provides lots
of wall space to utilize as flooring. make it squat enough, and wide
enough, and you get relatively low revs, too.

Another good suggestion, although not directly adaptable, that can be good
for tech: _Mobile Suit Gundam_. There is an english translation of the
novels. Lots of TL9 colonies and ships.

Joe asked Andrew Wardell: 
>Why, are you planning on opening a shipyard?  :)

Actually, Joe, I came across this problem years ago in MT/Striker. There
is a company called /trendi/ (Tavonni Research, ENgineering and Design,
Inc) in my campaign that makes vehicles, and a PC-owned shipbuilding
company. Both are based on Tavonni (SM 1520). In trying to get a profit
figure for /trendi/, I built a TL 12 air/raft using Striker. It came out
at about Cr150,000 - 200,000. The "real thing" sold for Cr400,000 (Bk2). 
Now, over 50% profit is not bad. 

The starships were a lot closer to their listed prices - presumably the
Bk2 vechile prices were guesses, wherease the ships were built using the
relevant design rules. 

Steve Charlton asked: 
>Since you are "Down Under," are these things still available down there? 

I wish. I can\'t even remember where I bought them, it was so long ago ("in
a galaxy far, far away", just to continue the quoting thread ;-). It was
probably _Mind Games_ down in Sydney, but they\'ve been shut for 10
years... boy, does that make me feel old! 

...And I even have the Cardboard Heroes. I\'ll have to see if they are cut
or uncut, but IIRC I have the Adventurers, the Zho military and the
Imperial military packs. Just call me a fanatic - but I\'ve yet to get a
copy of Rog\' "Fanatic\'s Guide..." 

Loren asked: 
>>...200,000 HG... 20,000 MT... 2000 TNE... 
>Where do these numbers come from? 

They were gleaned /en passent/ from Don. Essentially, Joe is correct; we
were discussing the _shipbuilding_ rules only when the figures came up. 
Maybe he meant "the main MT rulebooks" for MT. Certainly he was referring
to FF&S _only_ when he referred to the TNE sales. Sorry to cloud the
figures with bad reporting. %-(

I do just about the same, the effects on devices is more muted than
yours I suspect, but the effects on people is about the same.  

One reason electronic devices are less affected in my games is that
electronics are much less high-tech.  Gravtics shortens the MTBF of 
micro-electronics so much that everybody uses vacumn tube level tech.
(That\'s also why Virus wasn\'t an option in my games.<g>)

I used to have a copy of that list and it\'d be faster to photocopy and 
mail it to you.  At close to 10 (?) 14(?) pages of stellar data, 3d 
co-ordinates, etc etc.  That list is a monster.

I remember programming the French Arm into my 3D animator at the time.  
Turbo Silver for those of you who had Amiga\'s in the 80\'s.  It took me 
hours just to program in that one arm.

I\'d send it if I had it still, lent it to a friend and he\'s in 
Saskatchewan on manouvers for the summer.

We have a beer commercial up here in canada with these two explorers, 
1600\'s time period, Martian and Jaque.  Anyway they paddle across the 
country and Martian keeps talking about this great beer we\'ll make in the 
future and what the future will be like.  In one of the episodes he says, 
Martian:
"One day this will be the longest undefended boarder in the world."  

Jaque:
"Undefended against who?"

Martian:
"The people to the south of us, lets call them American\'s will flock here 
on their holiday\'s marvel at how clean it is and how great our beer is."

Jaque"
"What will these American\'s give us in return?"

Martian:
"Something called, \'Baywatch.\'"

Yes, Baywatch the high point of American TV culture.  And the brilliant 
point of the show is it\'s people running, that\'s it they run, what more 
do you want to see.

I always though this was a brilliant add.

Definitely the best commercial around, I even look forward to seeing th next
\'installment\', kind of unusual considering it\'s a commercial. :)

A good rule of thumb for the upper-end speed capabilities of a large
displacement hull (lie a freighter or a carrier) is the square root of its
length on the water line.  I don\'t know why it works, it just comes pretty
close...

        A couple of points to add: length at waterline to beam is also a
factor, but hull speed is irrelevant if the hull is of the planing type...
which fast smallcraft tend to have, and behemocarriers (I suspect) don\'t.
And hydrofoils are brutally cool; I usually get a close look at the Hong
Kong-Macau jetfoils every AM on the ferry in to work; you\'ve got to have
respect for a boat that has the Boeing logo on its side...

        But wouldn\'t the Nimitz planing be a sight to see :)?

Not really.

FF&S had sold out well before GDW went under, which means that we had
gone through at least one print run (typically 10-20K units for an
initial printing, 2-10K for a second) of FF&S (and IIRC, FF&S had two
printings...maybe I\'m misremembering). I forget which book the MT ship
design rules were in (Ref\'s Com?) but since the book also contained other
material, I don\'t see how it is possible to tell who was buying ship
rules and who was buying something else. There are reasons for buying
High Guard other than ship design.

IG can go with whatever basis they want to for ship design. I\'m sure
Marc/Ken/Don/et alia have other reasons than sales numbers (and I\'m
not sure what value there is in comparing total CT to MT to TNE
numbers anyway CT had a tremendous head start and total sales of all
titles were in the millions of units).

FWIW --
_My_ Zhodani (the ones Bill Keith and I wrote about lo these 15-20
years ago in JTAS) would consider using psi talents for personal profit
to be a form of theft. if the idea occured to them at all.

I have a few (they were hard to get over here), and they are first

Frank and I loaded it onto trucks. The vast majority of these trucks
were headed to various distributors in other states (presumably for
resale...distributors are funny that way). Some of them went to the local
paper salvage company. No TNE products (no Twilight products, no DC
products) went into the shredder.

I\'d try at the local hobby shop, and mention Berkeley Games and
Chessex.

Nobody, that I recall. Bill Keith and I dreamed them up, but I can\'t
recall a coherent influence (other than the theories of Konrad
Lorenz).

Not yet.  I\'m in the throes of an upgrade here at home (my Amiga
of 10 years has been replaced by an Intel box); on top of that, I\'ve
been taking extra work to try and get the new PC paid for.  Unfortunately,
Traveller doesn\'t pay, so it\'s at the bottom of the priority list.

The basic fix is that HEPlaR drives should use 14 (yes, 14) times the power
listed.  That hurts, and will probably break a lot of HEPlaR ship designs.
Hopefully tomorrow evening I can finish getting the new PC set up, and get
Excel to generated the new HEPlaR table for me.  That is, if my clients are
happy with their scripts and don\'t want me to change it.  Again.

Currently yes, but that treaty (I think it\'s a test-ban treaty rather
than an international law) doesn\'t ban the use of nuclear reactors or
radioactive isotopes for power in satilites.  I also think the ban is
limited to a certain number of kilometers/miles above the surface.  I
almost positive a Nerva style rocket would be OK, both legally and
environmentally *above* the atmosphere.

Frankly an Orion style craft wouldn\'t be something I would want to see
used except as a last resort anyway.  There are *many* good
alternatives that don\'t have the problems of an Orion.

(in high pitched frantic voice with much arm waving)
"  ME... ME... ME... SEND ME !"

My further thoughts on the discution thread...

Reguardless of the tech level, I think that the biggest \'problem\' is a cheap
\'earth-to-orbit\' means.   Once in orbit, it is low cost but time consuming
to go where ever you want to.  The long transit times, at the lower tech
levels, should not be a hinderance to growth.   Look at 15th thru 17th
century travel to the far east from europe.  With travel times of 2-3 years
round trip, spain built an empire.
(and they didn\'t have \'nintendo\' games to pass the time.)
(and we can make in-system phone/lasercom calls home.)

Once a society developes routine use of local plantary space, sprawling
across the solar system would only be halted by unlikely situations such as:
  no where to go -- (you are at the only planet in the system, drat the luck.)
  enemy action -- (those nasty Martians, they don\'t want to share the system.)
  religious doctrine -- (God said he would come back to Earth, to take everyone
                         to heaven, you don\'t want to be off visiting Jupiter
                         when this happens, do you ???   If you answer yes,
                         we will toss you in the loony bin, so behave, or else.)
  idealogical indoctrination -- (out there cold, dark, dangerious....
                                 down here warm, well lit, safe...
                        If you perfer out there to down here, your crazy and
                        we will toss you in the loony bin, so behave, or else.)

The point I am trying to make is that the hurdel to be crossed is
"earth-to-orbit" travel on a routine basis. not some benchmark of
engineering design and/or fabrication capibility.   This viewpoint would
factor in such effects as the \'will-of-the people\' to achive dispite the
costs, even with less then suitable tech level.  Or a society not so willing
to pay high costs, but with engineering solutions that are less costly
and/or safer.   This point of development may be crossed at tech level 7
thru 10 or even higher if one of the unlikely situations is present.

I\'m afraid that we must take responsibility for "Saved by the Bell."  
Then again, you can blame the Canadians for all those funny coins we

I think it\'s a funny ad, but I\'d like to think we\'ve contributed a 
little more than that to world culture...

You could start with music, for one.  Virtually every major musical 
movement of the 20th century saw its origin in the US...  Ragtime, 
Jazz, Blues, Rock, etc...

I don\'t think things would be nearly as interesting without Hollywood...  
(OK, so the world could have probably lived without Friday the 13th, 
but still...)  :-)

Ironically enough, it says something about Baywatch that Canadian 
ad execs are commenting on it... not sure what it says about 
Canadians...they must be watching it if they find this funny... :-)

On the other hand, I have no illusions about the quality or total 
lack thereof in Baywatch... :-)

Derek,

I\'m not saying your wrong, but I don\'t think you could accuse the 
Japanese of the fear of technology and change so typical of the 
Vilani...

I can see the resemblances in cultural conservatism, but there is 
cultural conservatism to a greater or lesser extent in all cultures, 
including Western civilization...

If you\'re refereeing a game for which background material is published, you
should treat all of the published material as something other than the AGOT,
and decide for yourself what the AGOT should be.  That way, your players
can\'t figure the universe out before you.

It\'s just like real life.  We all know that Neil Armstrong was the first man
on the moon because, well, it\'s a historical event, and he says he did and
Buzz Aldrin says so too, and there isn\'t much real controversy over it.
None of us actually saw it, however.  I saw something on TV that the
announcer told me was our astronauts on the moon.  I\'ll never really know,
but the world works ok for me if I assume that that\'s true.

Likewise, my players all know that Grandfather wiped out all of his Droyne
descendants and retired into a pocket universe to contemplate whatever.
None of them have ever been there; they\'ve just read Secret of the Ancients.
The universe works ok for them if they assume that it\'s true, until they run
into facts that suggest that it isn\'t.

You remember those submarine movies where the crew are walking around with
boards held in front of them, looking for steam leaks?  I\'m thinking of
something like that.  Maybe the board would have a piece of sensitive
electronic equipment on the end -- or a beaked monkey from container DL-22

I expect Year 0 vending machines (TL11-12) will analyse the coin, do a

these parts...  Unfortunately, I wasn\'t able to attend until Sunday, 
and the Traveller related gaming was on Saturday... :-(
The good news is that I was able to pick up a couple of Traveller 
related items for a reasonable price...  :-)

1 of them I picked up I already had.  I bought it with the intention 
of giving 1 of you fine folks an opportunity to add it to your 
collection for what should be a fairly reasonable price...  :-)
The item in question is the CT campaign, The Traveller Adventure, by 
Marc Miller...

The book itself is in good to very good condition.  The only visible 
wear is a bit of fraying along the edges of the spine...  The binding however is 
intact, and I suspect that somebody used it a few times to run the 
campaign, then resold it...

My intention is to put it up for auction.  I am not here to rape 
people though, so I intend to conduct the auction in the following 
manner:

1) I will be accepting 1 bid and 1 bid only from each person!  Make 
your first bid the most you would be willing to pay for this 
wonderful campaign...

2) Minimum bid shall be $10 US (which is what I paid for it...)  Bids 
shall be taken in $1 intervals only.  If you don\'t want to pay $10, don\'t 
bother sending e-mail to me...

3) Bids will not include shipping.  US customers can expect $3 for 
priority mail, maybe slightly less if book rate or something of that nature.  
International customers, I\'d need to find out at a later time.

4) Payment may be by money order, or check (US customers only).  
Money orders I\'ll ship out as soon as I receive them, checks will 
wait 2 weeks to clear...

5) All bids should be sent to me at: 
sdollar@goodnet.com

Please include the word \'auction\' in the subject line...so that my 
mail filter will send it to the right place...  

For the sake of bandwidth, absolutely NO bids will be accepted 
that are sent to the mailing list...

6) I reserve the right to change or modify the rules to this auction 
at any time...(but it would be very unlikely for me to do so)

7) Bids shall be accepted until a week from Saturday, July 27, 1996...

8) In the unlikely event of a tie, I will e-mail the parties 
involved

If you have questions about the book, or about the auction, e-mail me

Believe it or not, Rock and Roll is considered to have started in Ontario,
Canada.  I don\'t remember who the artist was, but some Canadian is credited
with cutting the first Rock and Roll song.  Lame when you can\'t remember
who it was to support your argument, but Canadian musical contributions
(such as they are) mustn\'t be ignored; else we\'ll send hordes of ravening
beavers at you.

It says something about Baywatch when P.Anderson/Lee/whatever, the epitome
of the American bouncy blonde, happens to also be Canadian (from
Vancouver).  So, in effect, we are watching an American show starring our
own exported cheesecake.  That\'s really weird.

BTW, Keanu Reeves (the male equivalent of ms Lee?) is also Canadian, as are
many others in Hollywood (more than you\'d think!), but I think that it\'s a
profession requirement that you hide this fact if you want to get big in
the U.S.

No, none of this means anything or has anything to do with Traveller, but
it beats working by a long shot.

True enough. You don\'t see a bazillion posts on reg.games.frp.ad&d
saying "Black Sun is logically inconsistent and a crappy setting!"
Imagine people criticizing "Vampire: the Gathering" - 

Player: Hey, that\'s not the way Vampires suck blood at all! They
use an elaborate enzyme reaction with parasitic microbes that
help filter potential disease threats, combined with a powerful
sleep-inducing phereomone released from sweat glands around the
neck... I have several journal articles detailing the chemical
process involved in the enzymes breaking down heloglobin while
preventing coagulation...

GM: huh?

Too many people treat Traveller as some sort of dogmatic religion,
not as the game that it is. Well, parts of it anyways. (though I will
be the first to admit that contradicting previously written material 
isn\'t a good thing to do.)

Wow. The demise of GDW may be the best thing to happen to
TML - now Loren can answer all our questions about the evolution
and development of Traveller from an inside viewpoint. Cool.
Not that I think GDW going bust was good, but you\'ve got to admit,
Loren answers questions a lot more now...

So, what I want to know is, were the Alien modules developed in the order
they were released in? The Vargr existed in modules well before their
Alien module cam out, right? Were most of the races detailed in JTAS
before they got bumped up to "full module" status? Not that this is important,
just curious...

And as to the Trav. Aliens resembling other Earth cultures, I think 
it\'s true to an extent, but the authors seem to have gone out of their
way to be too indirect about it. There are considerable examples of influences
from Niven\'s \'Known Space\' Aliens (right down to the line in \'Hivers\' 
that says \'The Hivers are not the Puppetters!" Aslan, Solomani, Hivers
and the Ancients all have fairly visible influences from the Kzinti,
Niven\'s future Earth, the Puppeteers, the Outsiders and the Pak
Protectors (at least I think...).

   Dammit, figures his name would drop from my mind just as i hit the "r"

Michael J. Fox, and Harry Dean Anderson are Canadians as well...  The 
late John Candy, and most of the cast of what used to be the cast of SCTV...  
Kids in the Hall

You\'re right...  It don\'t have a lot to do with Traveller...

IMHO, Probably the Mongols... The mongols ruled russia for over a century;
they didn\'t bother with direct control... but the punishment for
non-conformity to their government was the death of the "rebelious"
subjects. So who are the Hivers modeled after?

Yo,
  Have a look on "http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~jaymin/chview". There is
a list of several thousand near stars plus a 3D PC viewer. I\'ve had
very appreciative comments back from 2300 players about the utility
of this tool.
  If you just want a list, poke around on 
ftp://ftp.maths.tcd.ie/pub/jaymin/chview
and look for *.lst. These are just ascii listings of the collected stars.

Cheers,
Jo

  I wouldn\'t be positive that this was necessarily Cleon\'s view at the time.
It may have been more of a political convienence for short term benefit.
Of course history re-wrote it all...

The best source of "slang dialogue" I\'ve seen has been in Steve Perry\'s
books (no not the Conan books he wrote). No one can argue that he writes
anything but breezers, but he has a really neat set of slang. "Cools" are
cops and such, can\'t remember the rest but I\'ll try to jot them down on my
LONG flight back home.

Which brings me to another topic, I\'ll be relocating and although I know I
don\'t generate a lot of traffic I sometimes like to believe that _somebody_
out there might get in touch with me so it is with much ernestness that I
announce that I\'ll be moving very shortly. I\'ll be offline probably until
the end of the month when I find out where I\'ll be living. Until then, happy
Travelling!!!

Well, I disagree about it all originating in the US, but it was certainly

those are one and the same..).

Neil Young?

In the 58th Century, Canada will be (mis)remembered as a country with two
official languages -- English and French -- so at war with one another that
the country needed a German national anthem:

   Yeah, that\'s the guy I was thinking of. 

   After I posted, I started thinkingh sbout this. I think the original
poster is wrong (unless he wasn\'t thinking about Young), b/c Neil couldn;t
possibly have published stuff before Elvis. 

   I guess it depends on what you mean by Rock & Roll. ;)

I don\'t recall the exact thrust, but you\'d be surprised I think how low
it is, the Orion was a big ship as I recall. And it was *multiple* bursts

You might follow the trail blazed by other magazines and take your name 
from some game element (ie, HPG/FASA\'s "High Passage"): "Free Trader News".  
Or you could go with a name that is reminiscent of some present-day 
publication: "Traveller Times," "Travellers\' Quarterly," "Imperium 
Today."  Or, you could do something simple and straight-forward, like 
"Traveller E-Zine." :)

Suggestions:

Fiction section:  "Travellers\' Diary," "Tales from the Front."
Rules variants: "Another Look At...[rule name here]"
Weapons: "Lock \'n Load"

Nasty, nasty!  Then again, once this happened to them the first time, 
they\'d hopefully make checks of the grid prior to jumping.  (Unless, of 
course, you have someone in hot pursuit, and they don\'t have time for that.:)

Yeah, but it\'s a lot prettier framed in the reticle of a periscope. ;)
Of course, a torpedo might have a little trouble catching her if she were running
fast enough plane, but if you did get her, Rock and Rolll!!

There\'s just subs and targets.  (of course, some targets shoot back! :)  )

Not really. Design of each race kind of proceeded in parallel, as we
(Marc, Frank, me, John Harshman, John Astell) worked on other stuff.
We had skull sessions, during which we proposed, discussed (and
sometimes discarded) ideas about each race. JH, me, and Bill Keith
would discuss the biology of an individual race, Bill would make some
sketches, and we\'d send the whole thing through another round of skull
sessions.

Aside from the Aliens handout, a race would appear as a JTAS article,
then would be expanded to a full-sized module (by which time things
began to harden), but details were available as notes (and Bill\'s
drawings) for use in modules. Each author along the line added
details.

Substitute "_every fiber, joint, ligament, and muscle in my body_" for

Mongols never entered my mind when working on the K\'Kree, and I think

either.

Damfino. Why does _every_ race have to have a single inspiration?

Interesting view.  I pictured them as culturally more like the
13th-14th century Chinese:  highly structured, rigid classes, very
traditional, bureaucratically governed, long history of past glories,
and rejecting of expansion and innovation (as dangerous and
unbalanced).  Doesn\'t *exactly* fit the Vilani, and the Vilani don\'t
exactly match the Confucian Chinese, but pretty close.

This might be a nice twist, let us pick a culture, and come up with a
\'Traveller\' alien race based on them to some degree.   The fun part is when
you change the setting the culture developed in by ploping it down in some
differant physical enviroment. (example: nomadic hunter tribal/clan type of
...   let us say Eskimo...  put in a resource rich enviroment, like say,
south west pacific island chains.)  Then develope the story line of why this
is so. (insect swarms force movement from island to island, and are
attracted to any settlement\'s food stockpile.)   Modify for any odd physical
characteristics there alien bodies have.

This will give you the base personallity arch-type of the culture.  Now
expand to intersteller scope and one possiable view is a enviromentally
minded people that don\'t understand the concept of land ownership. (any
empty building is fair game to move into and use until they move on.)   Very
friendly and helpful to distressed travellers, (if they have a spare manuver
drive and yours is broke, they will prob. sell it at a low cost or give it
to you), except in areas relating to life support, (they will fight you over
table scrapes of food.)

This concept works best if you know the subject culture only in passing.
(The facts won\'t get in the way.)
My only knowledge of eskimo\'s is what I read in comic books.

The scarey thing is that they ALL had to leave Canada to become famous. 
We also had this thing, where you did not make it unless you made it 
oversees. Fortunately this has resulted all the bimbo\'s and himbo\'s from 
our soaps to go to england to wear strange clothes at pantomines and pass 
out at American pubs.

But dont forget famouus Australians : Mark Miller! Bill Clinton! Albert 
Einstein! Prince Charles!....(Stop that! You are Getting silly...WACK!!!)

I think it\'s already been accepted by those who support the Virus plot 
device and who are familiar with the applicable, canonical material (as 
if that horse didn\'t have enough of my marks on it!) that there were/are 
devices that did not/could not serve as viable hosts for Virus 
infection.  A Sega Genesis (or the Traveller tech equivalent), if not 
used for a dormant \'egg,\' would make for a very stupid Virus, which just 
happened to be able to manage flashy videogames pretty well.

Transponders were merely one of many means of infection, and a darned 
convenient one that the early strains, especially, were able to put to 
good use.

Virus countermeasures, as instituted by those societies which survived 
the Collapse, involve minimizing the opportunities for Virus to infect 
the \'protected\' system, and minimizing the damage that said system could 
do if infected.  Conventional wisdom holds that rendering a system immune 
to Virus infection is impossible.  Post-Collapse starships, for example, 
do not have anything near the level of system integration that previous 
designs did.  Making a starship a viable Virus host requires physically 
connecting all of the systems with data cables.  The first documented 
example of such a travesty can be found in the "Lady Elise" adventure 
that comes with the TNE Referee\'s Screen.  Even so, this \'infection\' was 
barely viable, not only because it was of limited function to begin with 
(having been purpose-built by another virus to carry out a specific 
mission) but because the dispersed nature of the infected starship\'s 
electronic architecture did nasty things to its personality, not to 
mention its ability to respond quickly to a given situation.

Someone getting 150 Mj of photons shot across their bow in space will be 
oblivious for the same reason that I\'d be oblivious to the beam of my 
pocket laser pointer travelling across the room.  If it doesn\'t hit 
anything, you don\'t see it.  Whoever thought that you could \'fire a 
warning shot across the bow\' with a laser must have been hearkening back 
to those dogfights in "Star Wars", where sizzling green bolts of energy 
from "lasers" would fly about.

Well, if there had ever been a TNE re-release of the "Starship Operator\'s 
Manual," that might have been okay.  As it stands, barring some error 
during the transition to J-space, or the destruction of the ship, nothing 
that happens on board will change the duration or destination of the 
voyage.  Besides, in my campaign, at least, the engineer doesn\'t get to 
sit and twiddle his thumbs -- there\'s too much routine maintenance to 
do.  Having the chief engineer chasing the rest of the crew around with 
paint cans and brushes has led to some interesting roleplaying situations.

Well, according to the SOM, the fuel was not consumed instantaneously.  
The central part of the J-drive, according to that resource, was merely a 
fusion plant that had only one rate:  "Very Very Fast".  Part of the 
\'jump-fuel\' was actually used as coolant while the rest was fed through 
the J-drive\'s reactor, with the resulting energy pumped into a 
high-capacity energy sink (In SOM, these are exotic, superconducting 
\'zuchai crystals\').  At the end of the \'burn\' which, if memory served, 
took at least several minutes (or more like thirty), the stored energy 
was then pumped through the jump relay governor into the lathanum hull 
grids in the proper sequence over a comparatively short period of time (a 
fraction of a second).  At the end of the entry process, the ship was 
sealed in a \'bubble\' and was \'tumbling\' merrily through J-space with all 
of its jump fuel allocation expended.

Actually, pre-TNE-novel canon holds that staring at the jump field can 
be a Bad Thing.  In my campaign, almost all viewports are sealed to 
prevent passengers and crew from suffering hypnogogic hallucinations and 
the like.  I can\'t remember exactly what SOM says about jump exit, but I 
do believe that there is some warning offered by the jump field soon 
before the return to normal space.  What it might be, I couldn\'t say 
right now, though.

You\'ve probably already been \'zinged\' for this, but:  It was the RC, not 
the Regency, that adopted \'domesticated\' (Peacemaker) virus strains for 
their own shipboard computer systems, as detailed in the "Vampire Fleets" 
sourcebook.  That same resource also, quite unmistakably, points out the 
Regency opposition to such an action.  Check out the quote about "pacts 
with devils" if you\'ve got it.

I think I\'m being *badly* misinterpreted.

What I am saying is essentially this:

1. Stick to the laws of physics, and other "known reality" if at alll
   possible. This lets players extrapolate from whatever fields they
   *do* know, without running into trouble.
2. When it isn\'t possible, be consistent. 
3. have as *few* "new laws" as possible. (ie, if you keep having to add
   more rules to handle "side effects", then maybe the original change
   wasn\'t so hot)
4. consider the *consequences* of the new laws. For instance, thruster
   plates lead to near c missiles, unless you can find a way around it.
   (There is a *simple* one, but it won\'t give you thruster plates that
   work the way people want)

Traveller only has *two* main areas where you need to change the laws
of physics. Jump drive, and thruster plates. Antigravity/contragravity
don\'t really break anything. Psionics doesn\'t follow the rules, but
they are generally too limited to be a major consideration.

Jump drive isn\'t a major hassle. The two big problems with FTL are the
simultaneity problems, and time-travel. With jump drive working as
specified, you need unreasonably high real-space velocities to create
any problems.

We already know the problems with thruster plates. The energy
consumption won\'t fit as long as they operate more or less as
described. Which means you get near c rocks. <sigh>

>> Suspension of disbelief does have to come into play somewhere.  Jump 
>> drive, Maneuver drive (thrusters or HEPlaR), meson guns, PAWs, don\'t

Jump drive isn\'t a big problem. You specify its behavior and forget it.
Thrusters are a problem because the consequences of their behavior are
a problem. Reaction drives we already *have*, just not that good. So we
know how to figure for them, and any "problems" are a reflection of the
way the real world works. Meson guns have been done to death, but the
basic principle (it only goes off at a set distance) is *workable* (ie
it doesn\'t cause contradictions). PAWs? We *have* PAWs. They just
aren\'t fit to be deployed.

Or that leads to a glaring inconsistency. Ever sit down and figure out
what things would *really* be like if the typical FRP game rules were
the "reality" of a world? It *wouldn\'t* resemble the middle ages very
much.

Actually, the difference between SF and fantasy is a bit more subtle.
Either way, you are postulating a world with different rules. For a
story to be SF, the changed or added rules must be something that is
*thought* to be possible (or else be of a limited set of "not possible,
but time-honored" ideas like FTL  or time-travel). With fantasy, the
rules are *not* thought to be possible.

With "hard fantasy", you set some rules and stick by them. Poul
Anderson\'s "Operation: Chaos", Randall Garrett\'s "Lord Darcy" stories,
Heinlein\'s "Magic, Inc" and even Modessitt\'s Recluce stories all work
this way.

With Hard SF you try not to add any rules at all, and the story may
depend on the the details of the science. With more general SF, the
general rule of thumb is to take one change and see where that takes
you. Like Niven\'s transfer booth stories. The change there is "what if
somebody came up with a cheap teleportation device with this set of
properties". The consequences took him something like ten stories to
cover.

Not true. We *have* the technology. We\'ve had it for decades. It\'s just
not something we want badly enough to *pay* for. Give me the money, and
we could get to Mars, or establish a lunar colony, or even send a probe
to Alpha Centauri! (the designs for the Alpha Centauri probe were done
up 20 years ago by the British Interplanetary Society, and before you
laugh, please note the the BIS did some plans for a lunar rocket back
in the 20s or 30s. It\'d work.)

Hell, there are tons of designs for *improved* technology floating
around. Some get built, some just sit there. It all depends on whether
you can find backers.

Economics has the same problem that weather forecasting does. It\'s not
*possible* to have exact knowledge of all the variables, and the
functions are *highly* chaotic (ie minor changes in inputs lead to
large changes in the output). 

This just means that exact predictions are out. And you won\'t get exact
matches between historical data and the output of a model. But if the
model presents "reasonable" outputs (ie you get the same "climate", and
the frequency of "extremes" is similar to the real world) then you have
something good enough to work with.

With a "realistic" game in the sense *I* mean it, the game *design* is
what needs the realism. Then if the players never examine anything in
detail, it doesn\'t matter. But if they need details about something
they don\'t wind up with something "impossible" (like the 70 kilo crunch
gun).

When was the last time you heard of a bridge or building failing due to
improper design? When they do it makes nationwide news. Failing for
lack of maintenance, yes. Due to sabotage or natural conditions
exceeding design parameters (earthquake, flood, etc), yes.

Last bridge failure I heard of was the Tacoma Narrows bridge(suspension
bridges are only about 150 years old). Last buliding failure was that
"skybridge" thingie in the hotel 10 or 15 years back (and that was
technically not a design failure).

Particle weapons are *lousy* in an atmosphere. That\'s why you don\'t see
them deployed. Lasers are better, but not a lot better. Again, that\'s
why they aren\'t deployed. We aren\'t doing SDI, so we don\'t have the
space based systems deployed.

You can\'t put an 18 inch naval rifle on a Coast Guard Cutter either.

I assume you are *not* using a CRT to read this? Thast\'s a practical
application of a particle beam. So is ion implantation in the
semiconductor industry and in some metal treatment setups. Both lasers
and particle beams are used to "etch" (cut) ID numbers into some types
of part. I used to work with a laser that burned ID strips into silicon
wafers. This was not photolithography or the like. I\'m talking numbers
and letters a couple of mm high.

Lasers are used to cut cloth and metal patterns. There are a *lot* of
industrial uses of lasers and particle beams. They just don\'t have a
lot of (obviuous) *household* uses. And such weapons uses as they have
at the moment are the type that you have to dig for in the literature
(or else have a *high* security clearance and "need to know")

You don\'t hear about it because the Energy Department doesn\'t want to
publicize "breakthroughs" in a research area that they decided to shut
down. We had "breakeven" several years ago. But since then the budget
cutting dropped all but the most promising line of research. Then they
they dropped that since it was just "one item" in the budget.

The heck with "self aware". We\'ve got systems that can do anything a
ship\'s computer would be called on to do, and take a lot less space.
Hell, unless you are running a *massive* "remote computing" type setup
(airline reservations, banking, credit cards), there are actually good
reasons for *never* having a computer over a cubic meter or so. 

You can trade speed for processing power, and for speed you need to
have the computer be *small*. Remember, a nanosecond is less than a
*foot* (ie light travels less than a foot in one nano-second). Since
current flows in conductors are considerably *slower* than light (30%
or so), that means that for really high speed systems, all the RAM and
CPU stuff *has* to be close.

> at some point there will be diminishing returns in new computer technology...

Sure. We are almost there for IC technology. We can\'t go too far into
the sub-micron level before we run into quantum effects.

On the other hand, we are also starting to investigate computing
circuitry that is *based* on quantum effects. Things like quantum well
transistors. 

And when considering just how far things can go, consider that the max
density for *storage* may well be individual protons in a block of
metallic hydrogen. That\'s something like 10e60 bits per cc!

Nope. No need for gravitics. Spinning for gravity works just fine if
you build the habitat large enough to avoid inner ear problems from the
spin (UI think that requires a radius of 100 meters or so).

Among the many other prospects, one suggestion is to just send up some
Salyuts (the Russian space stations that preceeded Mir). We *know* that
given enough supplies, they can be used more than long enough. And
attaching enough supplies is *not* that hard. As I recall, it worked
out to something like one launch of one of the larger Russian boosters
to get the supplies and main vehicle into orbit, and one shuttle flight
to carry the crew *and* their Salyut module (it\'ll fit in the shuttle
bay!)

That\'s because it was never *intended* to do that. It was specifically
designed to haul cargoes into low earth orbit. Something to go to the
moon would be designed a lot differently.

Not true. Unless there is *no* firewood, and no rocks on the island, I
*can* make use of the gold. It\'s too soft for tools, but I can pound
some of the bars into a drinking cup (trust me, unless you have a saw,
you *don\'t* try making a cup out of coconut shell). 

I might even manage to work up a mirror, or even draw the gold into
wire. And I can make a battery....

Actually, unless there\'s some accessible obsidian on the island, stone
tools will be a *bitch*. Stone tools require some rather specific sorts
of rock, and obsidian is the most likely to be found on this sort of
island. 

On the other hand, if it takes you more than a couple of *months* to
get to the stage described above, you aren\'t trying. Especially since
establishing a garden is rather pointless for the *native* plants. And
you don\'t have any "non-native" ones.

Sorry, but if you made that island one with nothing but drinkable
water, and some sort of food supply that doesn\'t require or provide
tools, you won\'t be any wealthier than when you got there.

*Resources* count. Without them, there\'s nothing to produce wealth
*from*.

The framing is the stuff that looks like ribs AND ALL THE GIRDERS ETC
ATTACHED TO THEM. The hull is *just* the "ribs" and the plating that
attaches to them.

To put it a different way. If you\'ve ever seen a house being built, it
uses frame construction. If it used "hull" construction, they\'d only
put up the frames for the outside walls and fasten the plywood
sheathing to them. Then they\'d put on the framing for the roof and add
the plywood to *that*. Then they\'d start putting in the framing for the
floors and internal walls. 

Yet a third way is to look at "framing" as building the skeleton, and
then hanging everything off of it. "Hull" builds the "skin" then starts
filling things in.

Is that not just about exactly what I said?  A recap:

I say:  The Aslan probably have designators based on the owning clan.

To which you respond:  No, I don\'t think so.  Each clan would have its 
own prefix.

Funny, and here was me thinking that Jazz and Blues owed their
origins in turn to the work songs of the Africans brought over to the
US, and the polyrhythmic drumming and percussion that crossed
over from Africa to the US and to Central and South America.  So
you could argue that the foundations of virtually every major
musical movement of the 20th century originated in Africa folk
music.  Just to be ethnomusicologically pedantic.

Hell, how to get this round to Traveller.  One thing that isn\'t mentioned
very much is popular culture in the Imperium.  We\'ve talked about
elements of pop culture surviving into the Far Future, but what about
the culture of the Imperium?  What does your average Imperial do
to unwind?  What TV/holovid programmes are the people\'s favourites?
(Orbitwatch, set in the search and rescue department of a large
spacestation where the sun\'s rays have unfortunately turned all the
vacc suits transparent?)

Doubtless there would be an infinite variety of sports, but I should
imagine that there would be 3 or 4 contenders which have at least
sector wide popularity, if not more.  I wouldn\'t think, (contrary to
much sci-fi) that any of the most popular would be along the lines
of Rocketpack Zero-G Jetball kind of stuff, as virtually all truly
popular mass sports are playable by the average kid in the park,
jumpers for goalposts etc.  It\'s interesting to speculate whether
these sports would cross state/species boundaries - can you
imagine a tournament involving the Imperials, the Zhodani,
Vargr and Aslan?  Wars have been started over less.  I would
think that the Hivers probably wouldn\'t take part, but would
control all the betting...

Could be an interesting episode for PC\'s arriving on a new world.
They come across some extremely complicated event that is
obviously of deep significance to all taking part and watching.
Is it their most holy of holies religious festival, or is it the
championship decider?

Anyone have any thoughts on what Mr and Mrs Average Imperial
might do on their days off?

Better yet, compare the NASA budget with the various "Health and Human

*height* of the space program, they were spending NASA\'s annual budget
every *hour*.

Yep. To do a V-2 type rocket engine (or later) requires a type of pump
patented around 1905.

Funny thing, *given* the radio-isotopes (even if they still didn\'t know
*why* they were radioactive) they can be used at fairly low tech
levels. And seperating them can be low tech, if you are patient.

I suspect that the Belters would be able to trade an occasional "drop"
of ice and other items for an occasional launch of seeds or other items
easier to produce on a planet. It\'s not like you need a huge payload. :-)
