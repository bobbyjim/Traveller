"new" game system (RuneQuest:Traveller however might <g>), but for the
prospect of new CT suppliments (I\'m with Hitchikers: Leaving the trees was
a bad idea). The idea of the new alternate timeline is very exciting. So
neatly sidestepping the issue of alterations to canon by attrition, just what
does this new timeline have in store for us? I seem too remember right at the
end of the CT era a plotline developing in the TNS regarding someone surviving
contact with jumpspace. Can we expect this enigma to be resolved? Then we
have the aftermath of the 5th Frontier War. What is going to happen in the
Spinward Marches? Will Strephon actually make Norris Archduke? What is going
to happen with the Aslan? Remember the Aslan have pretty much run out of
worlds to expand into in the Trojan Reaches and Reft Sectors, so the Ihatei
incursions are still on the cards. Then there\'s the actual outcome of the FFW
itself. If one looks at the previous wars you can\'t help but get the feeling
of a slow Imperial retreat in the face of the Zhodani (in every war before
the 5th, the Imperium lost territory to the Zhodani); but in the FFW they
actually made up ground! Sure, not a heck of a lot of ground, but I can see
Imperial propaganda blowing this all out of proportion leading to all sorts
of expectations in the population. Then there\'s the Sword Worlds question.
Just how long will the artifical construct that the Imperium carved out of
half of the Sword Worlds last? and just how far is the Imperium willing to
go to preserve it?

Any how, I can see lots of potential here (the vexed question of Norris\'s
sexual orientation may even be finally answered <g>). I\'m not about to
dump my curious T4/CT hybrid or my non-canon Greater Magellanic Cloud
campaign setting; but I will be buying T:GURPS and ruthlessly ripping out
any thing I find useful. And I certainly will be looking forwards to some
lively discussions on the course of the alternate timeline (Loren, if you
need anyone to help, my hand\'s up) on the TML.

OK, I\'ll throw out the diamond approach and use the other gemstones.
Thanks.

By the way, at what depth would one expect these gemstones to exist,
especially the opals, which is a very beautiful stone? I was thinking of
making it a planet, dominatedby a mining corp that specialize in a special
type of opal only yet found at this place.

Well, like I said I just picked a large number to make its days really
long. On the basis of your arguments I\'ll tone the number down but still
keep it large, to like you said make it an anomaly that scientist would
want to study.

This is mainly for plot reasons. The mining operation is very high
security, and with a scientist research station on the planet this
security would be harder to maintain. I\'m tinking of getting the
characters involved in some way between this research station and the
mining corp.

I know. I was thinking Mercury, but of course if its covered in ice, which
it should be, the albedo will be significantly larger. I\'ll change that
to, thanks.

As i see it, 1107 and a 1116 where Strephon isn\'t killed shouldn\'t be 
that much different from each other! So why contradict MT and TNE, 
when you can produce the same products, set 10 years earlier, and 
consistant with Traveller Canon?
I\'d favor a setting that remains consistant with Traveller Canon, as 
would most TML-members.

I think this is very unlikely. What I think (and HOPE) is more likely is
that IG will learn a thing or two about editing and the game industry in
general from the experienced staff at SJG, and improve the quality of their
products. Right now, IG has a split personality; if CORE writes it (and IG
doesn\'t mess it up too much) it\'s  generally excellent. If IG themselves do
it, it often isn\'t very well put together. (FF&S2 is more like CORE; the
authors did a good job, IG messed it up.)  One thing that would help would
be if IG follows SJG\'s lead; prompt errata, and fixing mistakes in the next
printing. But T4 (or 4.1, as it will soon be) is not going to die. I myself
love GURPS, but for nostalgia sake if nothing else will continue using the
Traveller system to run Traveller .

Let\'s try this again; the GURPS Traveller background is an ALTERNATE
TIMELINE. it does not inavlidate anything! In the OFFICIAL Traveller
timeline, the Rebellion and the Collapse and the Virus and all that still
occur on schedule. This is a "what-if" scenario designed, among other
things, to make GURPS Traveller material  separate from IG\'s stuff.

Maybe because the current setting is 1,105 years before the "classic" one?
maybe somewhere along the line someone said "Y\'know, let\'s call nonpowered
battle dress "Combat Armor"...less confusing that way..."

All it takes is a little imagination...

Axtually, I was stressing over the damn small arms sequence.  It lists 
all these really cool ammo types (DS, HEAP, Hollowpoint, etc.) and

The solomani ARE relatively minor players in the published backgrounds.  Just
the way it is.  There was a book published on the Solomani called "Solomani &
Aslan" also called "Rats & Cats" for obvious reasons.

Sure, they conquered the 1st Imperium.  Big Deal, that was a long, long time
ago.  Rome once conquered all of the known world.  Italy is now a relatively
minor player in world affairs (no offense intended to our Italian readers).

No, 3G3 is the standard weapons design system for _eleven_ (plus) game
systems. (At least there\'s eleven systems in the conversion section) It
was originally concieved as a game-independent design system. At the time
this was announced, IG had NO products. Strictly speaking, 3G3 is also the
design system for TNE...there\'s seven pages of conversion information for
that game in there. Will it create an identical weapon to FFS? No, for the
same reason that it won\'t produce identical results to FFS2, they\'re
different systems that use different assumptions and equations for their
designs.

You can, except that since the equipment in the supplements was designed
with other systems, since FFS2 _didn\'t_ exist when the supplements were
written, the stats might be different. Also, sometimes, as in the case of
ships and vehicles in the T4 rulebook, they were simply made up out of
whole cloth.

The problem of course, comes about when we start talking about TL -12 5 mm
caseless ammuntition...there\'s no way we could say which if any of the
designs are accurate...all we can try to do is make sure that internally,
each system is consistent.

Yes and no.  From what I understand (its made clear in the 2300 AD books, I
believe), the background was a joint effort of many people all who played a
massive simulation to build it.  In addition, I bet it was pretty unrealistic
in the mid 1700s to say "In 200 years, the American Colonies are going to be
a world leader", and most would have said that that was pretty unrealistic.

Its a game, and a game that\'s been out of print for like 7 years or something
absurd like that, relax.  If America was involved in WW3 with limited nuclear
exchange, the U.S.ed be in a heap of trouble.  That\'s the way it goes.

America\'s already falling behind in a number of ways, and we haven\'t had a
WW3 yet.

The system has been out of print for like 7 years, why beat a dead horse?  In
addition, there is a 2300 AD mailing list you can subscribe to and read and
write to.

As far as the background, keep an open mind.  There was a time when Romans
thought the Roman Empire would never end.  There was a time when the sun
never set on the British empire, and so on...  Everything collapses
eventually.

For whatever it\'s worth, John, _Emperor\'s Arsenal_ was written by the author
of 3G3, and it was written before FF&S2 was published.  In his place, I\'d
consider either one to be sufficient reason for using 3G3.

That being said, I do stand behind FF&S2.  While you\'ll get slightly
different results from FF&S2, both 3G3 and FF&S2 will produce results in the
acceptable range for modern-day and historical firearms.

The results diverge when projecting into the future, but on one hand the
FF&S2 results are arguably more "Travelleresque" in that they\'re consistent
with previous Traveller material.  On the other hand, 3G3 doesn\'t provide
design sequences that cover Traveller-style PGMP/FGMP weapons (you
design them in 3G3 as small particle acellerators), and 3G3 doesn\'t work
for Traveller-style long-range starship lasers or meson guns.  Providing
all of this in FF&S2 means that you get a consistent weapon design system
for Traveller, from your hold-out laser pistol to your starship\'s main guns.
On the third hand (at least, if you\'re a hiver), FF&S2 doesn\'t provide for
binary-propellant weapons.

Since we couldn\'t include 3G3 in FF&S2, the only other alternative would
have been to leave weapons design out of the book.  In my opinion, this
would have been extremely frustrating (not to mention expensive) for FF&S2
designers.  It\'s hard to design many vehicles (like tanks and warplanes)
without having the weapons they carry already designed.  Imagine your
frustration and annoyance if you\'d had to go out and purchase 3G3 in
addition to FF&S2 before you could design anything.

For small arms, either 3G3 or FF&S2 designs should be acceptable, and can be
used within the same campaign.  Any differences can be explained by a
slightly difference choice of materials and technology based on different
worlds of manufacture.

By acting early and with great shock.  The French grabbed enough territory
to prevent refugees from reaching French soil proper.  Remember, France
wasn\'t a combatant, withdrawing from NATO when the Americans and British
came to the aid of the German Army in Poland.

I think France took a few nuclear strikes, but nothing major.  By 1999,
France had the only major standing army in Europe, and it was committed to
nothing other than defending the borders.

Since Greg answers his mail about once a year, I still haven\'t heard form
him, but the way it seems to have happened follows:

Greg Porter designs very good games (CORPS, TimeLords, Macho Women With
Guns), and a few years back he designed an universal design system for
building weapons, called Guns! Guns! Guns!  Included were conversions for
several systems.. The 2nd edition included MegaTraveller.

There was much rejoicing, along with much carnage.

When the original IG team was being put together, Greg was brought in to do
gearhead things.  Since he had a perfectly acceptable (if not excellent)
system for designing weapons, he wrote up the new T4 designs using what he
had.  The very latest version of his system (3G3) has conversions for MT,
TNE, and T4.

When Emperor\'s Aresenal was written, I don\'t think the new FFS was even
being written.  So Greg cranked out the weapons, wrote some pretty good
side rules, and sent the puppy in.

Then we get FFS2, which has a similar, but *slightly* different weapons
design system.  

*Sigh*

For what it\'s worth, I prefer 3G3 to FFS2.  The results are close enough in
the end so that you could do as Rod (?) suggested, and discount difference
in performance to manufacturing variances.

Norris beats back the dirty mind-raping Zhos using big strapping ihatei
mercenaries, who wear rather smart-looking uniforms of his very own design.
Centuries of ungulate flatulence lead to runaway greenhouse effect on most
of the Two Thousand Worlds, and the Vargr, whiffing pre-cooked meat for the
taking, pour across the Lesser Rift without the protection of jump bubbles.
The Outworld Coalition collapses, and Norris is glamorously victorious.

Unfortunately, the Imperial citizenry of the Marches, stirred up by Darrian
attempts at psychohistorical, go haywire and break the armistice of their
own accord.  Snot-nosed Solomani mobs invade the Consulate and pass along
strains of amoebic dysentary for which the Zhos have no natural immunity,
and gazillions of turbaned Zhos and goateed Zhanes expire messily.
Meanwhile, the two Sword World states reunite unexpectedly and declare
themselves to be the long-dormant Teutonic Order, dedicated to fighting the
Templar Menace.

Strephon has no choice at this point but to call upon his lurking Hiver
puppetmasters to save the day.  The Great Old Ones release a cheese-based
virus in the form of a purple dinosaur that destroys interstellar
civilization as we know it, but in a nice way.  Strephon has the erring
Norris replaced by a clever biological robot imposter, and likes the idea
so much that he does the same for himself.  The two of them become Elvis
impersonators, form a glitter-rock band to tour the Solomani Confederation
incognito, and live happily ever after.

Then Grandfather wakes up and sees his kids taking a shower -- and realizes
it was all a dream.

Gemstones in general require heat and pressure to form.  Thus, they are
found near volcanic structures, or where old deep crust has been exposed
by weathering, uplift, or a combination of the two.  This is a good reason
to use Doug\'s molten-core model.  The world need not be currently
volcanically active (though it could be); Mars\'s extinct but large
volcanos would be a good model for you.

As for depth, they could be found all through the crust, though obviously
a mining operation would tend to focus on the more accessible veins near
the surface -- say 0 to 2 km down, perhaps.

An interesting idea would be to give the world a sidereal rotation period
just less than its year (like, say, 200 hours less).  This would indicate
a world which was very close to becoming tidally locked, but hadn\'t
actually reached locked rotation yet; this would also interest scientists,
but be easier to explain physically.  And it gives truly amazingly long
local days, like thousands of Terran days long.  In fact, the days would
be *much* longer than your scenario, in which the day is effectively equal
to the year length, as the planet holds one orientation while circling the
star.

Perhaps the science station has a reserved region for study, including all
the crustal zone underneath it, and the mining company has found a rich
vein down there and is trying to sneak a tunnel through to mine it.  The
players are hired/asked by the scientists to help prove this is going on
so they can register a complaint with the world\'s Imperial administrator,
who\'s due for a visit on-world in a few weeks.

No prob...world-building is one of my favorite hobbies, and I\'m enjoying
this immensely.

Although I strongly oppose the canon-breaking aspect of GT, I too will buy
it. Mostly because Loren is involved. I think he\'s written great Traveller
material in the past and I expect that his work will continue to be great.
However, I intend to metamorphose his world and scenario descriptions to
fit my TNE campaign. If my players should visit a place described in the GT
books, they will visit a place much like that described in GT, but with the
added history of the Rebellion, Collapse and New Era.

And, obviously, GURPS mechanics are out.

I was just considering this myself.  In my Traveller campain (TNE ruleset,
CT setting, Spinward Marches, *right* after the 5th FW), this is an issue.
The resistance movements, the stray SW military unit still running around,

  I commonly use life support costs to \'chase\' the PC\'s off their ship
and into a local hotel (and into the aegis of local law, local customs
and local trouble (ie adventure)) if they get too strong tendencies 
towards lets-just-make-money-by-spec-trade-and-avoid-all-entanglements.

Nope; I have one myself.  They don\'t look natural on elves though (Cirdan

I don\'t know a think about lib or DIKU based stuff; all my experience is
with MUCK and MOO.  The server code for MUCK is reasonably portable, and
even runs under NT (I think - the scarygothicbikerservercodingbatbat
might know for sure).

Certainly not every week!  The point of jumping into a new system would be
to spend anywhere from weeks to months exploring the new system, and only
when its adventure possiblities were all tapped out, jumping to a new
system.  This would give the referee(s) several weeks or months to work on
the new adventure setting.

Also note that on a MUCK or a MOO (I don\'t know about the other servers),
it\'s perfectly possible for the referee(s) to be working on creating a new
area while the players are still exploring and solving the old one.  You\'d
just have a week to change the linkages and @recycle the old planet while
the ship was in jumpspace.

You could also have locations that were used more than once: a starbase,
stardock, or a planet that was visited frequently.

Now all we need is someone who can sell us some spare time; I could use
about 20 extra hours a week, maybe more.

Not likely.  The code is a _LARGE_ MUF library (MUF is Multi-User Forth, the
programming language implemented on MUCK servers).  Porting it to something
else would be a bear, and most of the code handles people exploring the map
database (by creating and @recycling virtual rooms as people move accross
the map).  The overall technique only works on servers that support true
recycling (unlike MOOs, which just mark objects as deleted and don\'t recover
the database space).  It\'s a map-exploration program, not a map-making
program.

Great!!
I consider GURPS the best RPG system out there by far. Check out the
Vehicle design system, consistent, detailed and with RULES on how to use
all those nitty bitty details in gaming. Detailed tactical combatsystem
(heavily leaning towards fantasy swords  fights but thats OK), boring but
detailed char gen.

All Traveller referees should buy at least GURPS Vehicles (or Robots) and
Compendium II wether they will play with URPS rules or not.

Ooops - got a little overexcited didn\'t I?

I have been trying to stay out of this discussion but this makes it
somewhat difficult.

Many people respond to other people emotionally rather than rationally. 
When the government or the church depicts another group of people as
inferior they go along with this idea.  This tendancy is inflamed when
you have just been at war with these people.

Suppose you are a Terran.  You were born around the time of the First
Interstellar War.  As you grew up you heard of the wars going on.  You
heard that there was a strange human culture out there doiminating a
vast stellar empire.  You heard of older relatives dying in the wars
with these strange people, maybe you even lost a parent.  You heard that
they had already claimed most of the planets near Earth, even though
they were from hundreds of light years away.  You heard that their rigid
and repressive culture was stifling your peoples need for lebenstraum. 
This culture denied that your culture had invented the jump drive,
thereby calling your people liars.  When you came of age you enlisted in
the military, as did most of your friends (its hard to fight a war with
a culture outnumbering you by (at least) hundreds to one.  Your unit
suffered heavy casulties from these people.  These people slaughtered
prisoners of war _including_those_you_loved_, in contradiction of the
cultural "rules" of war you had grown up with.  As you grew older there
were breaks in these wars and you found time to have a family.  After
serving 20 or 30 years in the military you were getting a bit old for
such an active life and you retired to a civilian career.  Your children
went off to war with these people and some of them did not come back. 
Every night on the news vid for your whole life you heard stories of the
bad things these people did.  You lived a life that was less luxurious
than your parents or grandparents because the war needs had to take
first place.  You paid very high taxes your whole life to finance these
wars.  You accepted these taxes as the price of your freedom but it was
kind of sad that you could not even afford a simple vacation for your
family on those rare occasions you got home to see them.

Finally the wars end.  You are old and retired now.  You have lost your
family to the wars, those that have not been killed have been called
hundreds of light years away to occupy former enemy planets - you know
you will never see them again.  All you really have in life are the
memories of what these Villani have cost you and a small pension.  Then
you learn that these Villani are suffering from a plague.  These Villani
still outnumber the Terrans by hundreds to one.  They have a far
inferior understanding of medicine. They are dying right and left from
disease.  The government is considering doing something about this but
it would be hard and expensive.  You see some pictures of these Villani
dying and it sort of bothers you to see children suffering but it is
really more than Earth can deal with. 

Are you going to give up part of _your_ small pension to help save these
people who have killed your friends and family, people you have heard
bad stories about your whole life ?

Unless you are a saint you are going to say "No, we are not going to

I don\'t think you really need this, other that to say that the
Vilani socio-political system was stagnant and discouraged
progressiveness, whereas the Terran system promoted dynamicism,
personal freedom, and et cetera.  England certainly didn\'t
dominate the world in terms of population during its Imperial
heyday, yet the British Empire was certainly one of the most
successful ones in spreading British culture and attitudes over
most of the globe.

Interesting observation. And yes, this is important.  But for
measles, mumps, and rubella, there are vaccinations.  While they
are not cures, they _are_ generally useful in _preventing_ these
diseases.  Mass inoculation programs, assuming that you can get
sufficient quantities of vaccines to appropriate locations in
sufficient time, will help here.  And I expect that the Terrans
would have had provisions for dealing with this; hell, we\'re
talking about it even today, with respect to future space and
planetary probes that are expected to bring back samples.

BUT: The Vilani have been doing the interstellar thing for a
couple of thousand years by the time they start trading blows
with the Terrans.  It is specifically called out that the Vilani
are generally incompatible with their world; this suggests that
the same could _not_ be said with respect to many of the other
human races that they encountered in that 2,000 or so years.
These other humans probably _would_ have encountered viri that
can "do" them; they would have been transmittable to the Vilani,
thus requiring the Vilani to learn from their subjects.  Rest
assured, by the time they start facing Terra, they will have some
experience on this score.

I suspect that this can be mostly discounted by the time of the
wars with Terra.  If the immune system didn\'t adapt _fast_, there
would be no Vilani left to adapt, or to fight the Terrans.

I suspect very much that it may have been politically impossible.
In a situation like this, Terra may well have felt it necessary
to install a military governor on each world, even if that
governor would end up doing nothing but looking at what the
Vilani administrators were doing and signing his OK to it.  This
Terran is going to have much contact with the Vilani
administrative castes, including the military administrators
(general officers and their staffs).  What\'s going to happen if
_these_ people start dying off due to unfamiliar (to the Vilani)
diseases?  You\'re going to have some _major_ problems, due to the
unavailability of the people on whom you are _most_ dependent,
especially in the early stages of consolidation.

Actually, by now they are.  Their immune systems may not be up to
"Terran Normal" standards, but they\'re not so out of it that
their immune systems would be totally ineffective.

Not necessarily - although had you said "comparatively more
primitive (i.e., lower TL)" I\'d have agreed.  Remember, the
Vilani are administering about 10,000 worlds at the time of the
Terran conquest.  They will have had some experience, and many of
the minor races would have, too, even before Vilani conquest.

....and it becomes even more reasonable if you generally restrict
its spread to the upper echelons, who will have had more contact
with the Terrans.  In some areas, perhaps it will be more
widespread (those areas where Terrans started colonizing/
immigrating, for example), but the key is to make it difficult
for the Terrans to administer their conquests.

I wouldn\'t worry.  The GURPS TL progression is mearly the
the "default" or "suggested" and is routinely modified to
suit different settings.  Know I don\'t know where they
will come down on the differences in CT/MT/T4 tech levels,
but I am sure it will be some combination of one or
more of them.

1. warsaw pact equipment was and is far inferior [ TL 6 ] versus our
hardware [TL8]
    dureing the \'80\'s the media had built up the soviets as a major
threat when infact the basic soviet troop is not trained to read a map
and the average soviet rifle company possess\' one radio . [ I was trained
in soviet doctine and hardware in the army ] . soviet vehicles are made
of magnesium alloy [ they burn ] 

If the U.S were to mobilize and engage in world domination, sans nukes
the world would fall in under two years.

    'body' => 'Hello all -

I was driving back towards work after lunch, and thought about
last month\'s Traveller meeting.  There were only four of us,
so I decided to just do some ship combat for fun.  It took
forever, because none of us remembered how we did it last
Spring and we hadn\'t touched ship combat in the sessions
between.

What did us in was the sensor lock + to-hit determinations.
Too much stuff, and with seemingly random significance.  I
fondly remembered Classic Traveller, which didn\'t worry about
things like sensors.  But then I realized that sensor skill
and sensor packages SHOULD make a difference.  Then I started
wondering how I would design ship combat... (wavy fuzzy lines
denoting "mind\'s eye" perspective):


Dice to Roll == Range Band (VC=1, C, M, L, VL=5)
Target #     == Ship size class

And of course, an exceptional success (all 1\'s) is a success, no 
matter how low the target # is... and an exceptional failure 
(all 6\'s) is still a failure, no matter how high the target #...


SENSOR LOCK:
- ----
+ sensor skill
+ active sensor rating
- - evader\'s jam sensor rating
- - evader\'s current max G rating


Examples:
- ----
Attacker	Defender	  Range	Dice	Target #
- ----
sensor-2,A2	1000-ton, J8, 6G  M	3	9 + 2 + 2 - 8 - 6 = -1 (2)
sensor-2,A2 	1000t, J8, 6G	  C	2	9 + 2 + 2 - 8 - 6 = -1 (2)
sensor-4,A8	100t, J2, 2G      M	3	8 + 4 + 8 - 2 - 2 = 16-
sensor-4,A8	100t, J2, 2G	  C	2	8 + 4 + 8 - 2 - 2 = 16- (11-)



WEAPONS FIRE:
- ----
+ gunnery skill
+ (anything else?)
- - what?  (I don\'t have the book with me)
  (max G?  Can you outrun a laser?)


Examples:
Attacker	Defender	Range	Dice	Target #
- ----
gunner-2	1000t		M	3	9+2 = 11-
gunner-2	1000t		C	2	      11-
gunner-4	100t		M	3	8+4 = 12- (11-)
gunner-4	100t		C	2	      11-


Implications of this Unamended House Rule:
- ----
Close and Very Close range, without significant negative DM\'s,
are almost guaranteed to work.  Is this realistic?  If not,
then would a simple fix solve the problem, such as adding one
die to roll for each range band?

It is the letter "T" followed by the Roman Numeral IV ("four" to

On the subject of low tech levels, I agree with the comment that there
isn\'t much room for variation there. The Trav tech level system seems more
heavily weighted on the high end, such that historical examples of tech
variation on Earth aren\'t represented by it. Tech Level 1, which someone
mentioned was pre-gunpowder, metal weapons tech, is what the Roman Empire
was. Except that their knowledge of concrete (some of which set
underwater), for example, was only equalled in Britain in the 19th century.
In terms of construction technology, they were highly advanced. Another
example of technological abberation is Hero of Alexandria, also living in
tech level 1 times, who invented a steam driven device used to open temple
doors. My question is whether there could be larger allowances for such
"technological abberations" in Traveller. I would imagine that this would
make for some very interesting design possibilities with reference to
planetary cultures and such. It seems so basic to the game that it
shouldn\'t be seen as so arbitrary. Consider, for example, the discussion on
Solomani biological and medical technology that took place on the list a
while back...

Which reminds me. Why wasn\'t the old tech level chart from CT reprinted in
the new T4 basic book? I\'ve mentioned this before, but no one answered. A
couple of pages devoted to this, and the possibilities of "technological
abberation" in specific fields of endeavor would seem to be a useful thing
to include in any new edition of the rules.

Even if it were GURPS Traveller. :)

   For the record TNE does in fact allow jump drives on craft smaller
than 100 tons.  IIRC, the lower limit in TNE is 10 tons.  There are
examples of less than 100 ton starships listed in the Regency
Sourcebook.

   As a practical matter (not dealing with storyline or mechanics
canon), jump torpedos as a weapon don\'t exist because they are just a
really bad idea.  Lanthum is suppose to be a semi-precious resource in
all versions of Traveller.  Jump drives as a rule are not cheap.  Also,
a lot can happen in a week--like news of a cease-fire or friendly forces
capturing the target world.  It is far more economical and militarily
wise to send in a ship equipped with serious stealth characteristics, a
black globe generator, lots of conventional thrust missiles, and a crew
who has more guts than sense to take out targets in an enemy held
system.

   This would not prohibit some techie down at the nearest Imperial
naval depot from proposing jump torepedos, and perhaps talking the
Imperial Navy into constructing a number of prototypes (perhaps even
enough to equip Leviathan) to see how they work as a real weapon. 
Having proven once again their impracticality (you have to figure this
happens every few hundred years or whenever there is an increase in TL),
the jump torpedos are disassembled and the project scrapped.

   Now jump torpedos as a *means of communication* have some merit.  I
seriously doubt you could convince someone after 1130 that they are a
good idea, but prior to that they would prove a cheaper alternative to
sending an X-boat.  On the other hand, they would have the same problems
that all systems without a human in loop have--what if something
unexpected happens?  You can only program in so many "what ifs" into a
non-sentient computer.  I don\'t need to tell you the problems associated
with using them for military communications (nothing like distributing
free copies of your subsector-wide battle plan to the enemy to put a
crimp in your glorious conquest of the galaxy).  I could easily see the
Imperial Scout Service deciding that the cost saving would not be worth
the inevitable loss in reliability in communications.

   Our differences on certain issues are...well known.  Generally when
we agree on something, that something bears very close examination,
since when we agree we\'re usually right.

   As for your tendrils, I found a wonderful cream that can take care of
the problem.  See?  <patting my head> Not even a bump...

   That, and support through Traveller Chronicle (disregarding those who
through individual effort are Keeping the Flame), is sufficent to
consider events after 1130 canon.  Now would I *love* to see somebody
else be allowed to produce new TNE sourcebooks (as in TNE, not a MMT
sourcebook dealing with New Era)?  Absolutely.

>but, let\'s get real here, do you *seriously* believe
>that IG has enough of a clue to last much longer before going belly up?

   Had Marc Miller not intervened and announced a major revision of
MMT?  Of course not.  Marc\'s intervention changed the equation.  IMHO,
introducing GURPS Traveller and SJG into the mix changes the equation
back to what it was before (actually it\'s more like throwing a 250 kg
gorilla into the room who promptly eats the math book).  While I\'m not
happy with GURPS rules on principle (yes, I\'ve read the basic manual),
I\'m made even more unhappy by the implications of what comes next.

>Even if there was going to be *no* GURPS Traveller?

   Assuming no GURPS Traveller, IG continues to plod along, producing
new material for a while, never stepping on the storyline after 1116
because they never produce anything for it.  Until one day somebody pays
either IG or Marc Miller a sufficent bribe (call something else more
polite and it\'s still a bribe) and is allowed to put together something
official dealing with post-1116 events.

>You\'ve seen all the comments about how game stores are shunning IG products
>unless they have been specifically ordered by customers? Don\'t look good.

   No, things don\'t look good at all.  But as I said above, the
intervention by Marc changes things (well it did anyway).

>So, I suspect, even if we end up with GTrav being the "one, true, Trav"
>you\'ll almost certainly get more RefCol/Regency stuff *eventually* ... and if

   I do not share your optimism.  It is entirely possible that the GT
line will consist of just enough product to put IG out of business, but
not enough product to make a "GT: Rebellion" or "GT: New Era" sourcebook
possible (remember, this is going to be just one line of many they
produce).  Given the basic premise of the whole GT concept--1116 and
beyond with no Rebellion, there would have to be some *major* rethinking
on Loren Wiseman\'s part even if SJG were to devote a considerable amount
of their resources to GT production.

>Nope, I\'m like most *AUSTRALIAN* Liberals (i.e. Conservatives) and Socialists
>(i.e. liberals). We don\'t need no steenking yankee politics down under in Oz!

   The analogy still holds.  Undoubtedly there are those amongst the
Liberals and Socialists in Australia who think of certain sections of
the Australian constitution as being a bit too "burdensome" for their
political agendas and are working toward ways to circumvent those
sections through less than constitutional means.  Should they be
successful, there seems little point in having a constitution at all.

>So we probably have more in common than you suspect!

   While you look forward to GT, or at the least are hopeful that yet
another fresh start will result in a product worthy of purchase, I see
the beginning of the end of Traveller as an independent game system. 
While you see an ever expending product line that may even include New
Era material, I see a limited product line that has no room for such a
publication.  While we may both agree on the possible (probable) demise
of IG, we disagree about what will happen next.  Given what I see
developing within the new paradigm, the best course for those who wish
to see large quantities TNE material (as in multiple sourcebooks) lay in
someone being allowed to license out or buyout the TNE copyright.

things.  Lets all take a deep breath, count to 1000 slowly and breath out
(those that are still alive that is... :-)).

What was in my original message was MY personal opinion on Traveller,
GURPS, and some of the background.  Those of you who like GURPS can play
it, I don\'t care.  Believe me, the thought that GURPS exists does not keep
me awake at night and I have other things to do than to hate something.  I
have a large collection of GURPS stuff and I believe the supplements for
the game are problably among the best produced for any game.  Some days
ago, one of the posters replied to me presenting his opinion on GURPS and
describing how I was wrong (Sorry I don\'t remember your name, I destroy
most messages from the TML since I get too many).  I noticed also that my
original message created a lively discussion and for that I am happy.

One of the purpose of the message was to indicate my support to both Loren
and Marc for what I think is a good move (God knows I have complained
against IG and its policies).  Although I will not use the GURPS books, I
think the game needs any help it can get (especially after the treatment is
has been getting from IG).  Any help, including SJG, is quite appreciated. 
I don\'t know any of the two (Marc or Loren), but I hope that the support
from old timers (that is the way I describe myself) would be appreciated. 
The game does not only exist for them, it must also answer some of the
things that we want, otherwise it will die.  In the past, many games were
created (ever heard of Albedo, Cyborg Commando, Time & Time Again, or
Universe to name a few?), all these games were written by people who liked
gaming and liked their own personal system.  Traveller, on the other hand,
appealed to a large number of people by combining elements of hard science
with space opera.  This is the combination that attracted me.  

Now to reply to some of the comments concerning my dislike

I don\'t like GURPS for multiple reason.  I believe the unremembered poster
(please forgive me) did demonstrate why I was right (in my own eyes: I am
in complete agreement with everything I say ;-)).  None of the following
comments are to be interpreted in a way to be insulting or challenging to
anyone else\'s opinion.  They represent the opinion of the writer only.  Any
insult is in the mind of the reader!! <grin>

Difference in creation of characters.

As I said before, Traveller is a character generation system, GURPS is a
character creation one.  While you might consider right for players to play
the same character over and over again, I assume that the purpose of
playing is to roleplay.  It involves being faced with different
personalities, views, advantages and disadvantages.  It also overcoming
poor stats when they are generated.  GURPS is a nice system for players
with imagination to create characters.  Most good roleplayers I know would
not create the same character over and over again.  However, others don\'t
do that.  We all know the player who will complain and abuse the smaller
points in order to obtain the most.  And no, the simple fact that the GM
can be tough is not the answer.

A set of rules is, ultimately, an agreement between individuals to a set of
conduct.  It is not a distatorship that exists for the enjoyment of the GM
only.  Even house rules have to be approved by the other players.  If not,
the group desintegrates.  It is exactly the same thing about allowing
players to do things or not.  It is quite preferable to answer a question
like: Why can\'t I do this? by "because the rules say so" instead than by
"because I don\'t want you to".  One implies a reliability on the policy
established (the rules) while the other indicates a personal decision by a
dictator (the GM).  An answer by an agreed set of rules always reduces
discussions and fights. 

I find a character generation preferable to a character creation system.  I
find it imposes more on players and, ultimately, creates more interesting
characters.  This is one of the reason why I didn\'t like the TNE character
creation system (or more precisely a mix between creation and generation)
while I liked CT, MT and T4.

GURPS is not very good with tasks.  The 3d6 roll is cumbersome.  I
preferred the MT system that created a better "curve" (on this I can be
proven wrong)  I like the modifiers in MT.  I think GURPS has the same
problems with favorizing tasks that T4 does.  At least, MT favours skills. 
I have always preferred MT on this issue. 

As to tech, I don\'t think anything comes close to TNE (FF&S is a wonderful
book).  Yes I did not like the absence of thruster plates, on the other
hand, TNE had wonderful feel to it.  Everything was part of a whole (the
system for weapons, ships and vehicles) was ultimately incorporated.  The
optional tech created a wonderful opportunity to introduce other things
into the game.  While I did not like the background of TNE nor the absence
of thruster, I did like its handling of tech.  Let me just mention that I
do use GURPS for some things (Swashbuckler is an example: I am preparing
for a convention in Ottawa this weekend), but I still dislike many aspects
of it.  For example, GURPS handles armor almost like AD&D (armor teleports
you out of the way (I know this is not completely true, but this is
sufficiently close to the truth for the purpose of my demonstration), it
does not differienciate between penetration and damage.  That is one good
point for MT, TNE or T4.

Yes I will miss the Rebellion.  Norris, hero of the 5th frontier war, is
not the same as Norris, Keeper of the Flame (or the man who named himself
Archduke).  I will miss the Regency (even (once again repeating myself) if
I hated the Virus).

I will purchase GURPS traveller.  I will shamelessly rip the ideas out of
it and incorporate it in my own personal campaign.  I am looking forward to
GURPS Traveller.

One last thing, please stop SJG from substituting his Tech levels for
Travellers.

(sigh)

The reason they aren\'t setting it in 1107 is probably because that era has
already been done! And as for contradicting MT, this is an ALTERNATE
timeline. it doesn\'t contradict ANYTHING. It\'s a "what-if" scenario. By
taking the story in a different direction after 1116, they can examine what
MIGHT have happened if the "assassination" hadn\'t occured!

I think the concept of alternate timelines should be familiar to almost any
fan of science-fiction. If not, a few episodes of SLIDERS should suffice to
familiarize people with the concept...

Well CSC is right in line with Mark Miller\'s traveller in regards to CR\'s

Sorry but why would any one have a home computer when they can get a space
computer, Sorry David but that was too weak a response that I would have

As it is right know the FFS2 CSC Computational conversions breaks "serious
canon" from the T4 first book. Right now imperial intelligence can not have
a CR 5 computer at TL-5 but any starship can.!!!!!!!!

Don\'t you think SJG has used a alternative timeline so that much of the
CT vs. MT vs. TNE vs. T4 bickering can be avoided?

Oh, but now it\'s going to be CT vs. MT vs. TNE vs. T4 vs. GURPS bickering
instead. The best option would be to take what you like and keep your
flamewars to yourself everyone (please, somebody start up a TNE and
Gurps:Traveller list)... 

Now for my 0.02 $AUS - I only use TNE because it is the most consistent
version available in a small number of cheap (compared to T4) books with
clear, concise errata - I\'ve fixed all my books using a pencil and the odd
stuck in paragraph). Sure the setting is not the best, but I\'ve always
regarded Traveller by its excellent mechanics and wealth of options rather
than branding it by its setting (this is not a White Wolf Games product
everyone) which in the end can be completely ignored if you wish. The fact
is Traveller (any version) does a better job at generic SF roleplaying
than any other system. GURPS Traveller might just open a few GURP-ite eyes 
as to how SF should be played.

Well, the term is non-canon, but I use it to mean the ability to manipulate
nuclear forces in the way we can manipulate electronic forces today. I
figured this would be required to create bonded superdense armor or tunable
X-ray lasers.

Unfortunately those things show up a TL 14, not 13 as I have them. Tech
Level groups were given in multiples of 3, and technical potential doesn\'t
break down so easily. For example, I wanted to make an "Atomic" group, but
that starts at TL 6, which is at the tail end of one group. I guess a
better idea is to pick the technologies first and the groups second. How
about this:

TECH LEVEL GROUPS
	TL	Age
	0	Pretechnological
	1 - 2	Mechanical
	3 - 5	Industrial
	6 - 8	Atomic
	9 - 10	Fusion
	11 - 13	Gravitic
	14 - 16	Nucleonic

I actually like this better because it\'s descriptive and you can actually
test when a society has reached a particular group. For example, creating a
nuclear explosion will put a society into the Atomic Age, thruster plates
put you in the Gravitic Age.

True. In fact I can imagine a TL 15 nomadic society. I think the idea of
tech level groups *is* to simplify the TL progression a little, to make it
more descriptive. My mistake was trying to combine social and technological
advancement into one table. Just because a society has the technology, for
example, of interstellar travel doesn\'t necessarily mean that they\'ll do it.

I didn\'t like the proposed "Hi Tech", "Very High Tech", "Ultra High Tech",
etc. progression because it seems no more descriptive than a numeric tech
level. I think my proposed groups describe the differences in tech
qualitatively more than quantitatively. Also I think describing a planet as
"late Atomic" sounds cooler than "TL 8". Your opinion may differ.

What happens if I plot a Jump 6 route which intersects my target planet 1
parsec away. Do I get precipitated out at my target in just over 1 day?
What happens to a ship that gets "precipitated out" anyway? If it\'s not too
bad everybody will be using this trick.

On the other hand, since interplanetary space is full of hydrogen atoms, I
may get precipitated out before my ship has traveled a centimeter.

I don\'t like the idea of ships in J-space actually following courses in
N-space which somehow interacts with N-space objects; it leaves a loophole
for ships in jump to use this to communicate with, attack, or be attacked
by other objects in N-space or in jump. Jump drive begins to look like Star
Trek\'s warp drive.

I assume the "100 diameter" is an abstraction and the actual limit is
determined by a gravity gradient. Otherwise the ship could lift off the
ground and jump because the planet is just a bunch of atoms and you are
more than 100 diameters away from any atom in the planet. How about
figuring out the intensity of gravity 100 diameters away from a typical
planet, saying that is the jump limit, then helpfully noting that this is
"approximately 100 diameters" away from the planet. This fixes the \'running
into interstellar hydrogen\' problem too.

Also, what are the probabilites a ship misjumps or has drive failure? I
don\'t like the misjump figures in T4 because they make it almost impossible
for any ship or crew to survive even a single term.

>	Comm: Commercial and private ships using standard drives.

>	T&T. Trained and tuned. Military ships with highly trained crews and

>	Perfect. If the rolls produce a perfect jump +/- 0, reroll on the

>column.

These need to be defined. How does the jump drive know it\'s on a "military"
ship? Is the drive physically different? What exactly does a ship need to
be "trained and tuned"?  Is there any way for players or commercial ships
to do this? There are cases when shaving even a few hours off your travel
time would be advantageous; maintaining a "trained and tuned" ship should
be expensive or everyone would be doing it. My suggestion is to drop
special "military" drives and just say military ships are all T&T.

I like the idea of the ships in a fleet arriving within several hours of
each other; it means the admirals have to use strategy to prevent the first
ships from being picked off as they arrive (eg. sending the biggest ships
first, or jumping to a rally point distant from the actual target) and
can\'t just rely on outnumbering their opponents. It also means individual
ships can react faster than a fleet. This has good game and dramatic
potential (should the first ship out of jump chase after the bogey which
may be an early-warning scout or risk waiting for the rest of the fleet in
case they\'re outgunned?).

These jump rules are good. They just need a bit more detail.

Assume every minor-human homeworld hosts life whose genetic structure is
based on DNA -- it seems a fairly robust molecule, and we certainly
haven\'t found any counterexamples yet....  :-)

Nevertheless, I seem to recall that human DNA codes for about twenty
different amino acids (out of scores, some used by other organisms on our
own planet and others not).  Each amino acid is specified by three base
pairs on the DNA strand, in a code not based on fundamental laws of the
universe, but purely on chance and evolutionary heritage.  What are the
odds that a completely alien ecosystem, of totally separate lineage, will
have the same coding scheme and the same amino acids employed, let alone
the same cell-membrane receptors and transport systems, etc.?

Virii are going to be completely new and exotic to the Vilani in a
"hard-science" Traveller universe.  Bacteria, yes, they will have met and
dealt with.  But the prospect of an organism which can hijack their own
cells to reproduce itself and lurk inside their own genetic code, should
prove a thought unworthy even of their most fevered Eneri Allen Poe.... :-)

Oh please.  Aren\'t you paying attention?  T2300 is a game that clearly
includes a major nuclear exchange in the final years of the 20th
century in its fictional history.  You cannot compare conventional
tactics and equipment to hundreds of nuclear warheads being exchanged
between the two biggest players of the cold war (not to mention the
other nuclear powers as well).  There was no documented ground war
between the US and the USSR in the fictitious background of T2300.
The USSR was also still very much alive, since the game was released
in 1986.  If you don\'t keep your arguments within the bounds of the
game\'s history, the whole discussion becomes pointless.

> soviet vehicles are made of magnesium alloy [ they burn ] 

Magnesium only burns at temperatures that would make any other vehicle
exposed to such heat useless anyways.  Exactly what vehicles are you
talking about?

LOL!  Get off your high-horse.  You are single-handedly keeping alive
the "loudmouthed American" stereotype that so many of your fellow
countrymen hate so much.  If it ever came to an honest threat at true
"world domination" by the US, every nuclear power in the world would
very well use their arsenal to make damn sure that doesn\'t happen.

I wonder if many people are conducting Traveller campaigns via the
Internet? I have heard of play by e-mail but I think I would find this too
slow going.

There are a lot of IRC type chat programs that would facilitate traditional
RPG playing over the Internet.
ICQ from Mirabilis (http://www.mirabilis.com) is an interesting program
for linking up with people on the net.
Another is EWGIE, an IRC chat style program that is a Java applet which
has a shared whiteboard facility that can load up images from web pages
(scanned in deck plans, hex grids, perhaps?) which might be useful
for RPGs.

I\'d like hear from anyone who is involved in doing something like this.
I want to play some Traveller and I think the Net is the only way I am
going to get to.

I haven\'t had a look at T4 yet, what is the so called T4.1 stuff about?
Wouldn\'t it be nice to have one set of rules and technology design
that work well for any Traveller era? Does T4.1 and FFSv2 fit the bill or
are you better off sticking with the rules that came out with particular
Traveller time period?

>What is tidaly locked and what does it imply?

a tidaly locked world always presents the same face to the object it is
orbiting.  The most obvious example is our Moon.  For a planet, it would
leave one hemisphere eternally lit, the other in perpetual darkness, with a
Teilight Zone at the terminator.

>How does a world get tidally locked?

Age is one way, worlds naturally slow down.  There are other mechanisms,
but friction and the "drag" of gravity are the main culprits.

>You or someone else mentioned that somehow tides could somehow start a
>planetary rotation or make it stop....How does this occure.

The orbit of the Moon around the Earth produces a noticable bulge in the
crust.. This speeds up the Earth\'s rotation by a microscopic amount.  It
also robs the Moon of a tiny bit of it\'s velocity, causing the Moon to
recede slightly.

De Nada.. Craig will probably amplify on what I\'ve said here.

There are two wonderful books to look for on this subject.  The first is
"What if the Moon didn\'t exist, Voyages to Earths that might have been"
that has wandered off, so I can\'t remember the author.

The second is "World-Building" by Stephen Gillett (Writer\'s Digest Books,
1996)  ISBN 0-89879-707-1

Both of these are great introductions to planetolgy, the second is
especially useful to the Traveller ref.

In 1939 the French had the best tanks in Europe, an impassable defensive
system of forts in depth, and a large, professional army.  Their entire
military line of thought was on defeating Germany, and preventing a German
invasion of France.

In 1940, the Germans conquored France in a little less than two months.

What did France in back in \'40 was a lack of understanding of how warfare
had changed.

In the T2K universe, the Germans assumed that since the Soviets were
involved heavily in China, the "liberation" of Silesia would happen in a
walk.  Wrong!  The second mistake was pushing into the Ukraine, which
triggered the nuclear exchange.

And your point?  The brand-new M2 Bradley is made of flammable armor.
Soviet doctrine was very different than NATO on subjects like small unit
tactics, they didn\'t want radios down to the squad level.

Not when the Military Government and Civlian Government are engaged in a
shooting war.

Now, I\'m as patriotic as the next guy, but the assertation that the US
could conquor the world in two year is truely bizarre...

It is the letter "T" followed by the Roman Numeral IV ("four" to 
those of you who are Latin challenged). An alternate universe 
represented by an alternate numbering system -- qite a jest, eh what?
 I could have said it was T100 (am I getting binary for four correct?).

Note however that the switch between small arms (<30 kJ muzzle 
energy) and light support weapons leads to more than slight 
differences.  Using the FF&S beta version I designed a 20mm 
pentabarrel autocannon for TL8 aircraft.  The weapon was under 1 
tonne mass and did damage 16.  The EA equivalent is larger, fires no 
faster and does damage 8.

I have not yet checked this using the published versions but my TL8 
autocannon uses a caseless, 20mm calibre, 30 kJ round, if anyone 
wants to make their own calculation.

But I\'m only putting it in terms that the Yanks (and other USAns) on the list

   I fear that the battle lines have formed up rather quickly on the
whole issue of Traveller canon, the future of IG, and the coming of
SJG.  Like most wars, it eats its young, lays waste to the land, and
cuts down the innocent.

   My immediate sense about GT was that, given its premise, it\'s going
to be bad for TNE.  It doesn\'t help that IG is giving us
a...uhmm...*workshop* on proofreading and layout, and that GURPS is
generally of such high quality either.  It doesn\'t take a gearhead to
figure out what happens if IG is suddenly out of the picture.

   I\'m glad to hear that\'s not how you feel.  Too many on this list TNE
bash as though it were the politically correct thing to do.  The
tendency when I see it happen is to react, sometimes very strongly.  If
my fire was misdirected, I am indeed sorry.

Jim... please... remember that you are on the internet, and that your
comments go to a lot of people who are not U.S citizens, who also feel very
patriotic about their own countries, and who would be very insulted by
thoughtless statements like the above. There is no denying that US military
technology is state of the art, the origional point is that the ability of
a country to dominate both militarily and economically both grows and fades
with time. Last century it was British Empire, this century it was the US,
next century I suspect it will be the Chinese, and the century after
that... maybe an Australian led Pacfic Rim Coalition ( yeah... in my dreams
:) ). 
PLease remeber that this list is about exercising our imaginations. I found
the concept of French domination very interesting, and actually well
thought out. 

And speaking of imagination.... :)

In M0, I wander what the makup of the populations of the worlds of the
Imperium would be. There is a lot of talk of the Aristocracy (well, a lot
of hints) being mostly Solomani in make up. Just how many solomani made it
to the Sylean regions. 
Is it a situation of Solamani aristocracies ruling over largely vilani
populations? I will accept that they may not be cultural Vilani, but I
strongly suspect that there will be a lot of cultural \'baggage\' still being
carried by the ex-Vilani. What kind of tensions would this situation create?

Oh, I hope not.  I really would like to think that the \'just about\' should

Allen has it right.

It is not my intention to invalidate anything. One thing I plan on doing is

	Now this is (again!) completely off-topic, but I\'ve greatly enjoyed 
playing SubSpace, an online shoot-\'em-up game. Besides, it\'s free (at 
least for now, see http://www.vie.com/subspace). If trying to come up 
with an adventure for next session is about to drive you crazy, 
blasting away a couple of irritating little fighters will (probably) 
make you feel a bit better. Won\'t help with the adventure though. :)

either Fulcrum-A or Azhanti HL.

	"No blowthru is allowed for any damage rolls of 12d or higher" or

	Now that\'s an interesting idea. But, why on earth would the US 
conquer the world again? They wouldn\'t, simply because the US 
decision-maker (GE, MacDonalds, IMB, Microsoft, what have you) would 
be mightily pissed off if the IRS went snooping around their 
business in other parts of the culturally conquered and assimilated 
Planet America.

I mean the concering Solomani (or invading, depending on your point of
view) completly devistated the Vilani cast system, cos it was too ridgid,
told them that technological inovation and forward thinking was the way to
go, and that beeing ruthless in war was evil and bad, and that they should
be more libral in there thinking and not stagnent concervitives.

I mean having someone tell you that everything you belive in is totaly
wrong is sure to initiate a major responce, maybe to the point of open
rebellion ? (or even e-mail flame wars  .... ;-)

Amen!  I\'m a kneejerk nationalist, but this assertation is stretching 
it.  If 1)nuclear weapons didn\'t exist, 2)we mobilized every 
able-bodied male, 3)we managed to equip them all to current standards, 
4)we managed to train them all to current standards, 5)no other nation 
in the world increased or modernized their militaries one iota between 
now and then, and 6)we _never_ got bogged down in any piss-ant guerilla 
wars, then yes, we could smash every single other nation on earth, one 
after another, though it would take much more than two years.  But 
since none of the above criteria can ever exist, that puts us kinda out 
of luck.

those no-hoper colonials in the North American wilderness had of defeating
the world\'s greatest power (Britain) and becoming independent, then rising
to dominate the world. They just need the right breaks - like a major war
where they don\'t get hurt much but the great powers get panned. Brazil (I
think) manages this in John Wyndham\'s \'The Outward Urge\'.

Japan was a deliberately backward country, having chosen to get rid of
firearms (they had rather good ones) in the 18th century. Look at their
economic power now, achieved in part by using foreign aid wisely after
their industry was bombed to pieces by the Americans who then fixed the
damage better than before! (One of the captains of the Japanese fleet that
so memorably devastated the Russians as Tsushima started his career in
armor, fighting on land with a battleaxe.) Progress happens, fast, and in
unexpected directions.

And as SF writers our brief is to explore a future different to today. If
you don\'t allow for one-off long shots to come off once in a while then the
future will be the same as today. 
	
And it never is!

"The only constant in our lives is change" - Anyone know who said that?
"No generalisation is worth a damn. Including this one."


Jump torpedoes? I always liked the idea - bloody expensive way of sending a
message but sometimes necessary. I mean, an Xboat IS a jump torpedo, albeit
a large, manned one. 


Lastly - Austerlitz wasn\'t a war. The 1805 campaign was, however. Basically
the French held off, beat or neutralised everyone in every campaign (not
each battle, however) between the first Revolutionary campaign (which was a
desperate attempt to prevent Revolutionary France being steamrollered by
hostile monarchies and culminated in the famous battle at Valmy), through
the famous 1796 Italian campaign (plug: read my book when it comes out to
find out about this from a fictional character\'s point of view!) where the
young Napoleone Di Bounaparte changed his name to Napoleon Bonaparte and
defeated the Austrians, Sardinians and everyone else, through the Egyptian
campaign (4000 French beat 25,000 Mamelukes at the Battle of the Pyramids;
a triumph of the new military system made possible by higher-tech weapons
rather than the weapons themselves), the 1800 second Italian (Marengo
Campaign), and the final defeat of 1814. Even then they came back for a
second round in 1815.
	
All through the wars with seven different coalitions, the French fought and
usually beat Spain, Portugal, The Confederacy Of The Rhine, Austria
(repeatedly), Russia, Sweden, Sardinia, Prussia, the Papal States, etc etc.
For 20+ years the French beat everyone who ganged up on them except the
British, who could be contained, beaten on land (like when they were
chucked out of Spain in 1808) but could never be subjugated because of
their big moat and floating bastions - the Channel, and the Royal Navy. The
French even found time to intervene in the War Of 1812 between Britain and
America.

I\'d say that was a pretty good run, wouldn\'t you? So who knows what they
could achieve? SF is only a medium for exploring possibilities. 2300
explored this one. I once looked at a resurgent British Empire dominating
space. Unlikely, but fun.

As I am sure Loren and perhaps even Mark will attest, one of the factors
that led to the demise of GDW (ONE of them, not all of them) were the "GDW
is going under" rumors. I suggest that it is not a good idea to be starting
this up again in relation to IG, which has enough problems of it\'s own, many
of which are of it\'s own making, true, but there is no need to throw fuel on
the fire. My feeling (and this is not fact) is that the GURPS Traveller
license came about because of a desire to make money on IG\'s part, and a
desire on the part of the creative minds behind Traveller to explore an
alternate timeline that they would not logically have been able to do for
some time, if ever, through IG. I think it is premature to be pronouncing
IG\'s doom, since they have not themselves indicated any problems exist.

Well, it can be argued that the amount of energy yield from nuclear fission
is not something one can improve on.  Perhaps there is a fusion warhead
table (I do not yet have FFS2)?

Ahem, the \'canon\' xboat was jump-4, not jump-6.  Saves a lot of fuel space,
as well as drive space.

The controls are a lot more than the dashboard gauges and the steering
wheel.  My new TL8 car has variable power steering, electronic automatic
transmission, antilock brakes, airbags, etc. that my TL7 car did not.  Sure
I could get my TL8 car with a TL5 manual transmission, but the effect would
not be significant (aside from the aggravation factor in traffic) and the
auto maker would not have really saved much money, nor would the overall
retail price drop significantly.  Besides, I would still have all those
other controls at TL8.

The other time this may matter is if the crew of a disabled starship
cobbled together a replacement control system (or subsystem) out of spares
or other system\'s parts.  In this case "The Referee should determine
subsequent events" and the design system should not be expected to cover
the eventuality.

All very well if it works for you, but my PCs would insist on being told
just why living aboard a ship in port is about 10 times more expensive
than living in the nearby town. I\'m stretching things as it is by letting
crew on board a ship on the ground consume life support supplies. On planets
with a breathable atmosphere they really ought not to have to pay for 
anything other than food and water, something that would run to Cr10/day.

I repeat what I\'ve claimed before: If you can subsist in comfort on a
long-term basis for Cr200 per month (lodgings not included), then Cr2000
per two weeks is far too high an expense for life support. (And _if_
Cr2000 _were_ a reasonable price for 14 days of life support, then it 
would be 50% too much for a passenger that spent only 9 to 10 days on
board).

While the 3G3 system may not have been "specifically" written for T4,
it is conceivable that-- with Greg\'s permission-- it could easily be
ported over, word-for-word, as an official T4 weapons design system
(with a few additions here and there).

For the record, the IG contract reads as follows;

A. License Coverage. Licensor grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts
	1) the exclusive right and license to utilize Licensor\'s Game to produce
English language printed role-playing game rules based on existing material from the Game System
Materials produced by Licensee may be characterized as the authoritative
rules for the Game System. All print materials produced by all other
publishers will not be allowed by contract and license to be characterized as
the authoritative rules for the Game System. They may be characterized as
"Licensed Products."
	2) the non-exclusive right and license to commission new original material
based on the game system, and to include other materials as Licensor may
approve.
              3) the non-exclusive right and license to utilize Licensor\'s Game to produce
English language printed game supplements, adventures, and other materials as
Licensor may approve.

Further, per Marc Miller (who sent me the above);

"Sweetpea holds licensing rights (again, from me) for other publication and
media deals."

Sweetpea is a *Movie Company*.  They are currently filming a D&D movie (no,
not an animated one).   They took IG over as the majority shareholder when
they were dissatisfied with the management of the company, per a clause in
their backing contract.

IG is the exclusive publisher of the "authoritative" printed Traveller
rules, but Marc has the right to license others to print
non-"authoritative" rules and supplementary material which may be
considered "authoritative" as long as they are not rules.

Sweetpea and IG do not have the ability to "pull" the license for GURPs
Traveller.  Marc Miller licensed GURPs Traveller and has the right to do
so.  His right to "pull" the license is dependent on the contract hey have,
but in light of the above carefully worded clause, I would bet good money
Marc holds the ability to at least "not approve" materials from SJG if he
so desires.

Remember that Ken Whitman made the original deal with Marc.  He is not the
lawyer type, and maybe it would not have done him any good anyway.  I bet
Marc\'s deal with Sweetpea is similarly tight.

     CORE is also considering the possibility of pure electronic

    'body' => 'First, some background. I run a modified MT in the year 1107 set in
the Spinward Marches. 

In my last Traveller session, my characters attempted to buy some
exlusively military weaponry, like ACR\'s, grenades and the like.
They\'re currently in Glisten/Glisten, where the law level doesn\'t 
permit that sort of thing. 

However, Glisten is the economic center of the subsector (and its
neighbor, District 268) and just about anything you can imagine (up
to TL15) can be purchased there. The military weapons my players wanted
were certainly in the system somewhere.

They searched and eventually found a local branch of Instellarms, the
mercenary outfitting store. A representative of that store told them
that he could have the weapons delivered to their starship, thus
circumventing the law level problem. 

At this point in the game it suddenly struck me that if it was that
easy, every munchkin character would suddenly have military weapons
galore! So I quickly had the Instellarms rep add "I just need to see
your Mercenary Guild registration, proving you\'re a real mercenary
outfit."

That took the characters aback. They agreed to get back to him and
promptly spent the next few days (in the game, not in real life)
registering themselves as a merc outfit. That cost them Cr100,000.
Glisten being the biggest bribery-motivated world around, they had to
shell out a few thousand more to get the application processed quickly.

So, my characters are now a merc outfit and have purchased the weapons.
Delivery will occur in two game days. 

I\'m now faced with a problem. I think I\'ve made it too easy to get
military stuff. If there is a Merc Guild, there must be annual dues
and some sort of certification and registration process. Perhaps a
representative of said Guild audits the group once per year to make
sure they\'re performing merc work and are deserving of the membership.

How do you handle it? Have I totally botched it up? Will my universe
be destined to fall into the hands of every joker who has a gun?

Well, I think jtorps would be the perfect replacement for xboats.  They
both require a tender for pickup, face the same likelihoods of misjump or
problems, and jtorps are much cheaper to operate and build.  As for the
integrity or security of the data, hight ech means of encryption and
one-off passwords will prevent most jtorps from being hijacked for thier
information, and the rest will make for good adventure scenarios.

As far as military applications, I see a message torp from a scout about to
be destroyed by a previously unknown squadron being an invaluable piece of
intelligence data.  The scout may not be able to jump due to fuel shortage,
damage, or other considerations (perhaps there is a chance of success in
battle, but the torp will hedge the captain\'s bets).  Again, hightech,
relatively foolproof security arrangements will prevent the info or torp
from falling into the wrong hannds (but may prevent the info from getting
into the right hands as well).  And those situations outside the normal
course of events are good adventure seeds.

Unfortunately, due to all of this, the existence and use of message torps
is a real canon breaker and I think they should be prevented from the realm
of possibility until say (late) TL15 or TL16.  This can simply be the
requirement of a human on-board any jump-capable ship to operate the jump
drive, or astrogate through jump space in an ongoing fashion, performing
some task that would require an AI computer.

I understand how you feel about TNE bashing. So many times, people forget
that this is largely a matter of taste. For instance, I have chosen to go
with T4 as a rules set (or more accurately. T4.1) because I prefer a simpler
game, on the whole. But I ran TNE and enjoyed it. And I still like the
background. I say, play whatever form of Traveller you enjoy, in whatever
rules system suits you.

The rest of you:

To paraphrase a show I like "Repeat to yourself "it\'s just a game, I should
really just relax"...too many people are getting too bent out of shape about
"canon" as if this were some sort of religious text or something. It is a
roleplaying game. Since the beginning of RPG\'s, they have been mutable; gm\'s
always change things to suit their tastes. I routinely add things like time
travel and alternate universes to my Traveller campaign. This is not canon.
Guess what: I don\'t care! I do not expect IG or Marc to support my
particular brand of weirdness, but I have the right to add these elements if
I wish. And, bottom line, my players enjoy it, and that is what matters most
to me. It\'s good to have continuity to an extent, but holding today\'s
authors to stuff written over 10 years ago when science, or even just
creativity, may suggest a better way is short-sighted, IMO.

I\'m looking forward to GURPS Traveller, although not planning to ditch my T4
game or to quit buying IG\'s supplements. I will probably run some GURPS
Traveller at our local gaming club, just to get some  experience with it,
but I have played the "current" version of Traveller (whatever that is) for
a long time now, and have no intention of stopping.

very well use their arsenal to make damn sure that doesn\'t happen.

The South African Defence Force had a non-official motto of Cairo in 30,
meaning the SADF could fight its way to, and conquer, Cairo in 30 Days. Not
many people doubt they could have done it. The USA could have a motto of
Europe in 365, sort of. The Euros would not use their nukes on themselves,
as, other than Britain and Russia, none of them could even reach the USA.
The USA could knock them out of any war, but occupation would be out of the
question and, sooner or later, they would rejoin the war. Napeleon ran into
the same problem, he could defeat just about any comb, but keeping them down
and occupoying them proved, in the end, impossible

Now back to Traveller: The (later) Imperium is similiar to the USA in terms
of relative power to its contemporaries. It could defeat any combination of
two of them, and probably three. But to actually conquer one would take too
much of its resources  too administer.

From the files:

"A good book for planet builders is _What if the Moon Didn\'t Exist_ by
Neil Comins (ISBN 0-06-092556-6).  It looks in some detail at about
half a dozen scenarios, starting with the moonless Eart of the title
and getting steadily more exotic.  Covers everything from day-night
cycles through weather to speculations on biology and sociology.  His
biology is very conservative, to my tastes (if Earthly life has
trouble with a condition he\'ll assume all life will have trouble) but
still fun.  There\'s enough material here for a good set of planets,
and you could also try to reverse engineer his methods and use them
for cases he didn\'t consider.

In the original announcents from the newly formed Imperium Games, they
stated specifically that 3G3 was to be the design system for weapons, and
that Greg in addition, had been commissioned to write the CSC sourcebook.

And 3G3 is _not_ "Timelords" with other conversions...it has _always_ been
a multi-system book, it\'s just that it uses Timelords stats as it\'s native
units.

No it wasn\'t "made" for T4.

The poster did not imply that 3G3 was *made for* T4, he stated that T4
used 3G3\'s design sequence -- which is absolutely true, if you\'ve seen
Emperor\'s Arse or The T4 main rulebook. Greg Porter, author of 3G3,
designed the weapons for both books using 3G3, and the latest version of
3G3 includes T4 conversions.

This is a very interesting explanation. Just to throw a wrench into the
works, let me bring up the topic of interest. Your explanation makes it
clear to me how the concept of interest, especially evil compound
interest, drives inflation.

In a perfect world were coconuts are commodities and money is just a
medium of exchange, interest would be noncentsical (sp?) <BG>

In the technologically and economically advanced Imperium, perhaps the
whole notion of currency self-replication through compound interest
would be seen as incredibly backward and barbaric. Would such a system
even be viable in when information travel times are measured in weeks
and months?

I don\'t presume to speak for Marc :-) but this "precipitation" rule is
something that I\'ve advocated before, so here\'s my take on it.

The trip through jumpspace is *not* equivalent to a linear voyage from
point A to point B, at a constant "hypervelocity" dependent on length of
trip. Once the ship enters jumpspace, the trip is instantaneous. The
duration of the trip is always constant because it takes one week to
exit jumpspace, not one week to make the trip.

The reasons for it taking one week to leave jumpspace can be handwaved
away. My favourite handwave is that it takes that long for the jump grid
to discharge, and until its discharge is complete, the ship must remain
in that alternate dimension of jumpspace. Other handwaves could be the
"tunnel through the earth" analogy, or jumpspace hydrogen bubble
dispersion/disintegration theory, or "grandfather made jumpspace that
way" heresy, etc.

In any case, after entering jumpspace the ship zips along the linear
line at an infinite virtual velocity until it reaches a point in space
with a certain gravitometric potential where it becomes "stuck" until
the week passes and it precipitates into normal space. Makes sense to
me.

Please note: I advocate that the ship isn\'t actually "moving" while in
jumpspace. Jumpspace is just a "mapping mechanism" for linking two
points in spacetime. "Velocity" and "Position" only has meaning in
normal space, it is meaningless in jumpspace.

I think it should be made clear that the interaction of a ship in
jumpspace with N-space is strictly with the natural gravity of N-space
objects. The force of gravity between a few atoms is infinitesimaly
insignificant.

I don\'t see how communication or attacks would be possible if the ship
is only affected by the natural gravity of N-space objects.

A while back Leonard and I had a little discussion on what actually was
at work here. His solution was to calculate the tidal forces of gravity.
The 100 dia. rule would only work consistantly if you calculate the
"rate of change" of gravity, not the actual "intensity of gravity".

Agreed. What makes the "military" drives so much better? And why
wouldn\'t commercial ventures use them? It seems to me that interstellar
commerce is the glue of the Imperium, and any technology which made
interstellar commerce safer, quicker, and more viable would be
disseminated very quickly.

Also, we have a few different systems for designing starships, and none
have a "military" designation for their jumpdrives. How are we supposed
to design military vessels? If the jumpdrives are the same cost and size
why can\'t commercial vessels use them? Don\'t give me a lame "top secret"
explanation. After thousands of years of jump drive use, I\'m sure there
are no more secrets.

I don\'t have a problem with the "trained and tuned" designation.

Actually, neither of the above is exactly true.

If I recall reading the designers\' notes for T:2300 correctly (and it\'s been
a while), the background for Traveller:2300 (aka 2300AD) was as described in
Twilight:2000; that is T:2300 is T:2000 after 300 more years.  As I recall,
the folks at GDW took the post-Twilight:2000 world, and ran it forward for
300 years using a big wargame-like scenario.  Various people "played"
different countries around the globe, and their status and development
determined in part what the T:2300 material looked like.

Thus, there was a nuclear exchange between the US and the USSR, but it was
the limited one described in T:2000 (that still crippled - not
destroyed - both countries).  There was also a major ground war, as
described in Twilight:2000.

Remember that T2300 presents this material from a perspective 300 years in
the future, so the "average" person in the game knows as much about the
actual details as the "average" person today knows about (say) the details
of the English Civil War.

	*LOL* I\'ve heard about it, run into it in IRC and I still have hard 
times believing it!

	BTW, the listings for Finnish military equipment in T:2000 are bit 
inaccurate. Lahti 9mm pistol (a very fine version of the classic 
Parabellum) is often said to be the standard sidearm in Finnish 
military, when in fact officers and MPs are issued ordinary FN 
Hi-Power 9mm pistols. Also, AFAIK the Valmet bullpup combat rifle 
never got off the ground properly. Paras tended to knock their front 
teeth on the protruding rear sight *ouch* and the army decided to 
update their older M-62 with rifles of almost similar design.

	I don\'t know much about the Lahti Anti-Armour Rifle, only that it\'s 
big, heavy and in Jack Higgins books IRA liked it for busting 
Saladins and Saracens and what have you. :)

You have several choices at this point, and we have all faced this, so be calm.

1). Start running a mercenary like campaign.  You guiding principal should
be that "If my bozos can get this stuff then any bozo can....and will!".
The characters should be faced with situations that their weapons are
countered with equally good or better weapons.  This will turn your
campaign into a striker game, with tactical situations a high priority.

2). Arrange facts so that the weapons are taken away.  It could be that any
registered mercenary unit must post a roster and table of organization with
the Imperial Government, and can be called to active Imperial duty at the
posted rates at any time.  Mercenary units are also often required to "post
a bond", that is to give a large amount of money (Megacredits) to a neutral
agency like a bank as an insurance against unlawful damages.  This can be
in addition to any bond associated with specific tickets.

Oh, and if they "make up" a roster make sure they know they have to buy
life and health insurance and provide other benefits throught he Mercenary
Soldiers Guild (local 1098).

3). (My own Choice) First make sure the weapons we\'re talking about fall
short of thermonuclear devices and grav tanks.  Now, the plot can be a
major limiter of what weapons can be carried.  Characters who travel city
streets in civilized areas are expected to leave behind their heavy machine
guns and auto grenade launchers.  Failing to observe this can result in
things like harassment and arrest, every punk kid challenging them at every
streetcorner, citizens running in fear when they appear, etc.  If they do
bring them (say in a vehicle or something) then the environment can be a
factor in preventing said weapons from being fired ("You\'re gonna fire that
in *here*?  You know what all that smoke and heat will do to the life
support!?!  And you better not breach the hull!").  This will tend to limit
things to the more sedate 9mm pistols or SMGs and 4mm gauss pistols that
are the weapons I don\'t mind dealing with.  In this scenario there will
occasionally be the opportunity for heavy firepower, and this should be
part of the game.  Weapons that are carried are concealed.

In any situation it is important for players to carefully detail what they
are carrying.  I have held characters to the one clip in the weapon when
they failed to record what they were taking from their base or ship when
"goin to rock and roll".  It can be a source of control when the players
have to do a bunch of paperwork to casually carry around heavy stuff.

Other thoughts;

Battle Dress requires the services of a maintenance technician with armorer
skill and some specialized and expensive equiptment.  Without this service,
hardware and software errors multiply.  This applies even more to vehicles.
Remember that TL8 combat helicopters require (AFAIR) *three times* the
number of hours of maintenance as they spend flying.

In sealed areas with life support, the smoke and vapors from chemically
propelled rounds and explosives are very persistent and can cause problems
breathing, explosions cause overpressure problems like burst eardrums, and
both can raise the temperature significantly beyond the ability of life
support to counter or cause fires which can be difficult to control in the
shipboard or orbital environment.  Damage to the walls also tends to damage
sensitive electronic systems (less likely on military ships) which can
cause such effects as loss of gravity, steady decline in atmosphere
quality, secondary explosions, electrical shorts of control systems, etc.
In other words, damage is always greater than the player expects.

Heavy weapons are *heavy*.  Be sure to implement any and all encumbered
movement rules based on the weapon being carried.  Always remember that
Rambo was fictional.  Even a very strong, high endurance sophont would have
trouble handling and firing an M60 medium machine gun from the hip, or even
carrying it for any distance while running.

Count ammunition.

Good luck.

Nope, Phil, you got that right. Both sides here in the US arn\'t

They are now registered.  This means that they must show proof of
compliance to the IRW, they must have repatriation accounts listed in the
appropriate banks, or file papers saying that they do not repatriate their
members, they must buy casualty insurance, and most important:

They are listed in the "dangerous persons" directory, available to
virtually all worlds.  Every time they land, the world in question will get
notice that they have just let a group of known killers for hire land.  Now
in many cases, this is good.  It can lead to lucrative contracts, and
interesting people, but they are now on the map.  If they are trying to
smuggle something forget it!

On the other hand, locals are likely to consider asking them for help if
they have a problem.  Consider this scenario - they land and go through the
usual customs inspection, and then the extra thorough smuggling one that
all mercs face.  After this terrible process, they are all dragged before
the head of security who tells them "Guys, I need a bit of help.  Too many
people are smuggling things through my port.  Can you help me out?"

Note also that in my world, a merc band is responsible for site security,
so it someone breaks into their ship and steals weapons not allowed at the
current TL, the players are responsible for what is done with the weapons.
Merc ships stop this by posting a guard detail on the armory.

Not at all - think of it as requiring a beeper that notifies all police
within a hundred miles that you have a concealed carry permit for a gun.
This is quite fair - they have the right to carry tools of their profession
that worlds would like to regulate, and Imperial law makes it possible for
them to circumvent some local policies.  In return, they bear a greater
level of responsibility and risk.

I like your Mercenaries Guild idea, and will likely steal it for my own use.

Okay, cool. I run a TNE Regency mercenary campaign.

Good call. Though I\'m having humorous visions of the Bob Dole Visa
commercial where he comes to the lunchcounter and the cashier says, "Okay,
can I see some ID?" Bob looks at the camera and says, "I just can\'t win."
<g>

I don\'t know that it would be required to be a member of a mercenary guild,
but that\'s certainly as good a solution as any. (In my campaign, the
mercenary guild is actually an extortion outfit that preys on fledgling
merc units.)

What they *would* require are permits to use and ship weaponry wherever
they were to take a ticket. Mercenary weaponry in Traveller tends to be a
bit more than your average hunting rifle, so I would imagine that there
would be a cost associated with approving both the types of weaponry they
intend to carry and the process by which the mercenaries ensure that their
weaponry is properly stowed away. In addition, they would be required to
sign affidavits that ensure they will not sell or give away this weaponry
to any parties that come calling.

The other element that might come into play is a Repatriation Bonding
Authority. Megacorporation Hortalez et cie is said to be a "mercenary
clearing house," specializing in selling repatriation bonds to mercenary
units so that they have a means of getting off whatever rock they\'re stuck
on if they get shafted by their patron.

Agencies like Hortalez aren\'t going to bond just anyone. If they bond some
mercenary unit that goes out and massacres a bunch of civilians on some
backwater world, the bonding authority is probably going to be held partly
liable for insuring such unscrupulous mercs. Mercenaries that flout the
laws of the Imperium (or the Regency in my case) are not likely to get
bonded in the future and may find themselves either imprisoned somewhere
the next time they\'re end up on the "losing side," or they\'ll find that
their reputation is tarnished and companies like Instellarms won\'t even
deal with them in the future.

Sounds like a fair price.

I make the Bonding Authority charge them a percentage of their ticket price
every time they take a job. I\'ve also written a draft of the "Regency Rules
of War" that gives them a fairly stringent guideline on what weapons they
can use and where.

I don\'t think you\'re risking your universe, but you may want to be careful
about the power level of the weapons they\'re carrying. The more powerful
the guns, the more powerful the guns their enemies will carry. You can end
up in an arms race that results in mutually assured destruction! Establish
that the cutting-edge weaponry is reserved for the military alone except in
rare instances. Also, if they clamor for more powerful weaponry and armor,
subtly remind them that the guy in the suit of battledress, carrying the
FGMP-15 is the *first* one to get shot at by the vehicle-mounted plasma
gun. ;-)

That\'s an interesting idea. Of course, the mission couldn\'t require
firearms and armor, since the characters wouldn\'t have them yet. That
limits the possibilities somewhat but I have a few possible adventures
up my sleeve.

However, what I was looking for was a more general set of guidelines
on how all the referees out there handle merc units, or PCs attempting
to become them.

   Without question in the Real World, the NATO of 1986 (even minus
France) could have defeated (at great loss of life on all sides) a
Soviet invasion of West Germany, assuming no nukes.  We know this now in
hind sight, we didn\'t know it in 1986 (when T:2000 was written).  

   In the scenario presented in T:2000 everybody who ever had a grudge
against anybody (I\'m surprised the UK didn\'t invade France and restart
the Hundred Years\' War) started shooting it out with each other--IMHO it
wouldn\'t have come down that way, but that\'s another story.  Anyway, if
Frank Chadwick et al. were to sit down and rewrite everything, it would
come across a whole lot differently in light of the Gulf War.

   Nukes are the great equalizer, which is why the NATO strategy for so
many years depended upon them.  It made any conventional invasion of the
West a non-starter (no one wants to be king of a glass parking lot). 
It\'s also why the Israelis have nukes, why Pakistan wants nukes, and why
South Africa wanted nukes but later gave up (power changed hands
peaceably).

   The background of 2300AD was the aftermath of the war fought in
T:2000.  Civilization is nearly driven to the brink and then crawls back
further along than it was before the war.  I have a *number* of problems
with the history, some related to the way the US was handled (mostly
related to the Mexican occupation of the southwest U.S., which was
pretty bogus in T:2000 and made even less sense in 2300AD), but also
Australia and a few other places.

   The BMP is inferior to the Bradley in a number of ways, but the

>> If the U.S were to mobilize and engage in world domination , sans nukes
>> the world would fall in under two years . 

   Given the current state of the US military I would beg to differ--it
is simply too small for the job.  Now, if the US suddenly started a
massive build-up (which the Chinese and other countries would
reciprocate), when in 10 years it might have enough forces to try to do
the job.  Latin America would fall pretty quickly as would Canada, and
then Africa.  I\'d *really* love to have some nukes in the Middle East,
but since I can\'t, I take it too at great loss to civilian life.  OK,
who\'s next?  Central Asia...OK, we bypass Afghanistan for now (we\'ll hit
it later) and go directly against India and Pakistan.  Not much of a
contest.  Southwest Asia even easier.  While the Australians would put
up a valiant effort, too much of their population is along the coast,
making them vulnerable to the US Navy.  Seeing the hand writing on the
wall, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the rest of Asia minus China and
Mongolia surrender without a shot.  Pacific Islands ditto.  Where are we
now?  Oh yeah, Europe.  Hmmm.  You\'re absolutely sure I can\'t have nukes
eh?  Well ok, first Portugual and Spain, then Italy and the rest of the
Med.  From Turkey I launch an invasion into the Balkans and reach
Vienna.  My forces in Italy link up with them and drive into southern
Germany.  Meanwhile, my forces in Spain drive into France, reaching the
Rhine in less than three months.  Linking up the last of my forces, I
drive into Poland and eastern Europe, stopping just short of the Russian
border (I\'ll save them for later).  This leaves the Swiss, which like
Afghanistan, I\'m going to leave alone for a while, and the UK which I
will first have to shoot down their air force and then bring my naval
forces to bear blockading them and then bombing them until when my
amphibious forces arrive they find nothing but ruins and scarecrows. 
Scandanavia falls much quicker.  Now what am I left with?  Russia and
China.  Hmmm.  I\'ll take China out first.  Massive civilian casualities,
and almost equally massive military ones (did I mention I\'d really
*love* to have some nukes at this point?).  This leaves Russia which is
going to have to be attacked by surprise (as if that\'s possible) because
of all the nukes they have laying around.  Conventional forces drive in
from the east, since it is only fronm the east that Russia can be
conquered (seems like I read that some place).  I then clean up all
those nasty spots I bypassed earlier by basically depopulating them
first with convention weapons (primarily napalm-based weapons).

   Now what\'s the totals?  Well it didn\'t take two years, more like
twelve.  Probably slightly under one billion dead (unless the Russians
let lose with a few nukes before they fall, then it would probably be
more like a billion and a half).  Much of the world economy wreaked. 
Infrastructure ruined in much of the world.  It will cost trillions to
rebuild everything.  Now I have to set up occupation forces...

   That\'s right.  Just because you can conquer the world doesn\'t mean
that you can hold onto it afterwards.  So the US could kick the ass of
any country.  Why?  What purpose would it serve?  Kicking ass is one
thing, but would you really want to be in charge of what\'s left
afterwards?  There are places in this world where you will have to kill
most of the population to bring them in line.  What will we become in
the process?

   Confidence is a powerful aphrodisac.  Over confidence kills.  While
much of what he said was accurate, some of it bears restatement or
withdrawal.

   I seriously doubt that any nukes would fall on US soil that didn\'t
have Cyrillic writing on them, but that\'s not how we operate.  We prefer
to let our merchants do our world dominating for us.  Afterall, we are
the cultural Borg....  :-)

Turn the question around:

Name a game company that knows what "proofread" means, and then ask if they
are interested in publishing one Traveller supplement a month for at least
the next year or two.

According to Marc, a year ago, IG was the only group willing to step up to
the plate.  After reading First Survey and Starships, I am not convinced
yet that this was an overall victory, but after reading FF&S2, Pocket
Empires, and all of the Core stuff, I am starting to think there is light
at the end of the tunnel.

IG still needs to learn to proofread, but the stuff they are producing now
has intrinsic value that would be enhanced with good artwork, good editing,
and good proofing, not completely created.

I like this idea. They\'ve formed a Commando unit, on paper. In reality,
they just want to be a merc team so they can get military stuff. They
have no interest in actually running in merc adventures.

I think that good ol\' Hortalez et Cie, on behalf of the Imperial 
government, will be collecting a MCr10 deposit from them. Heh heh.

Since all the members of the merc team are PCs, this probably won\'t
work. They\'ll just agree to waive them. But I\'ll keep this in mind
in case they hire anyone.

I do this already. This isn\'t the first time that they\'ve gotten 
serious guns and armor; it\'s just the first time they\'ve gotten \'em
so easily. Usually they have to pick \'em off the dead bodies of their
opponents or go through other serious sweat before they get a small
number of weapons.

I like this idea. They don\'t have battle dress but they do have combat
armor. I\'ll assume that Vacc Suit or Battle Dress skill is required to 
maintain combat armor. Maybe I\'ll use something like this:

	To don combat armor:
	Simple, Vacc Suit or Battle Dress, Dexterity, 2 min (fateful).
	Referee: An automatic mishap occurs when this roll fails.
	Increase the difficulty one level if no skill present or if
  	proper maintenance not done.

Maintenance could be done according to the following task:

	To perform routine maintenance on combat armor:
	Difficult, Vacc Suit or Battle Dress, Education, 10 min (safe).

Thoughts?

Ya know, when Shiela-X was first posted to the TML, I saved the post.
I later used her for several sessions as an NPC passenger in the

were both attracted to her.

Planets may seem pretty solid, but in fact they can and do deform slightly
under gravitational influence.  For example, the moon pulls on the near
side of earth a bit stronger than on the far side, which cause the earth
to deform into a (very slight) ovoid shape, with its long axis aimed at
the moon.  The oceans deform this way more than the land does, which is
what causes the familiar ocean tides.

Tidal drag on rotation occurs because the \'bulge\' under the moon (or other
body, in non-terran cases) does not rise and fall instantly under the
moon.  Instead, it lags behind the sublunar point, due to the resistance
to deformation of the earth.  This in turn creates a gravitation \'handle\',
which the moon tugs \'backward\' on, slowing the earth\'s rotation.  At the
same time, the bulge tugs \'forward\' on the moon, moving it into a higher
(and hence longer-period) orbit.  Left to themselves, the earth and moon
would eventually reach a state in which the terran day, the lunar day, and
the lunar orbital period were all equal at about 60 current days...but the
sun will go red-giant long before then and make the point moot.

The same process -- pulling \'backward\' on a tidal bulge -- is responsible
for all tidal locking.

You\'ve actually got this almost precisely backward, Douglas.  The Earth\'s
rotation slows down, with the angular momentum transfered to the moon,
which hence speeds up -- which, thanks to the truly wonderful weirdness of
orbital mechanics, causes it to move into a higher, *slower* orbit.  Go
figure...

Whoa! 

You seem to have read his comment as "3G3 was designed to be the

We did some figuring a while back. The formula that caused the least
hassles with reality involved an inverse cube law (just like tidal
forces).

Roughly, you figure that the property (call it X) is calculated like this:

X = GM/(r^3)

Where G = gravitional constant (6.673e-11 N m^2/kg^2)
      M = mass of body
      r = distance from body.

Let\'s figure for Earth, both because it\'s the "standard" for planetary
size and mass, and because we have good figures.

For Earth, GM = 3.986e14 m^3/s^2
    Earth\'s radius = 6371 km 

So, at 100 diameters, X = 1.93e-13 s^-2
The unit is "actually" (m/s^2)/m, that is acceleration change per meter.
At 10 diameters, X = 1.93e-10 s^-2

Note that the difference in gravity gradient is a factor of 1000! No
wonder a jump at 10 diameters is so dangerous!

Also note that we have a nicely "round" figure to use for the official
safety margins:

"100 dia" actually means 2e-13 s^-2
" 10 dia" actually means 2e-10 s^-2

X=GM/R^3
XR^3=GM
R^3=GM/X
R=cube root(GM/X)

And this means that *density* matters. You can jump a lot closer to a
low density object. This gets around the problem of the "100 dia" limit
of the *star* being too far out so often.

100 diameter limit for Sol: 1.39e11 m (139   million km, .93 AU)
           2e-13 s^2 limit: 8.72e10 m ( 87.2 million km, .58 AU)

One way Venus can\'t be jumped to, the other way it can.

[re-mailed to you from rec.arts.sf.science]
[the original seemed to come from wwoods@ix.netcom.com]

The first equation should be:

tau = (2c/a)arccosh[ 1 + (a/2c^2)S ] -> (2c/a)ln[ (a/c^2)S ].
                       ^

For the second, I get these expressions for Vmax:

v( tau(S/2) ) = c*tanh[ (a/c)tau ] = c*tanh[ arccosh{ 1 + (a/2c^2)S } ]
v( T(S/2) )   = c*[ 1 + (c/aT)^2 ]^-0.5
              = c*[ 1 - ( 1 + (a/2c^2)S )^-2 ]^0.5     check
 
 
 
Here\'s a collection of more-or-less relevant formulas and stuff: 

  Assuming a magical stardrive which allows you to accelerate
continuously at constant acceleration a, as measured onboard the ship,

a  : ship acceleration
tau: ship time (proper time)
d  : ship distance

T: Earth time
D: Earth distance
A: Earth acceleration

Mo: initial mass
M : mass of ship

theta(tau) = (a/c)tau        : velocity parameter
beta = v/c  = tanh(theta)
            = tanh((a/c)tau)
gamma = 1/sqrt[ 1 - beta^2 ]

v(tau) = c*tanh[(a/c)tau]
D(tau) = (c^2/a)*( cosh[(a/c)tau] - 1 )
tau(D) = (c/a)arccosh[ (a/c^2)D + 1 ]
d(tau) = D/cosh(theta) = (c^2/a)*( 1 - sech[(a/c)tau] ) -> c^2/a
                      d ~ c^2/a for tau > 6c/a

T(tau) = (c/a)sinh((a/c)tau)        (a/c)T   =    sinh( (a/c)tau )
tau(T) = (c/a)arcsinh((a/c)T)       (a/c)tau = arcsinh( (a/c)T   )

Alternately, in the frame of a stationary observer,
your acceleration is measured as:

A = a / gamma^3

A(v) = a*sqrt( 1 - (v/c)^2 )^3
D(T) = (c^2/a)*( sqrt[1 + ((a/c)T)^2] - 1 )
T(D) = (c/a)sqrt[ ( (a/c^2)D + 1 )^2 - 1 ]
v(T) = a*T / sqrt[ 1 + ((a/c)T)^2 ]
     = c / sqrt[ 1 + (c/aT)^2 ]
beta(T) = v(T)/c = 1 / sqrt[ 1 + (c/aT)^2 ]

tau(T) = (c/a)ln[ (a/c)T + sqrt( 1 + ((a/c)T)^2 ) ]

A(T) = a / sqrt( 1 + ((a/c)T)^2 )^3

For acceleration at 10 m/s^2, the time taken to reach various distances
is:

For a trip which goes from standing start to standing finish,
calculate the time to cover half the distance,
then double the T and tau variables.

DistAlphaCen    = 4.3 ly = 41 Pm = 41e15 m
    1/2 DAC     = 20.5e15 m
    1/2 tauAC   = 55.7e6 sec
    1/2 TAC     = 93.7e6 sec
TauToAlphCen    = 111e6 sec = 3.5 yr
TimeToAlphaCen  = 187e6 sec = 5.9 yr
 

For a perfectly efficient photon rocket,

theta = ln(Mo/M) , so        M(tau) = Mo*e^[-(a/c)tau]

or more conveniently,        theta(Tau1/2) = ln(2) = 0.7

so the rockets halflife is  Tau1/2 = 0.7c/a

for instance, for a = 1 kgal (= 1000 cm/s^2 ~ 1 "gee")
Tau1/2 = 21e6 s ~ 8 months

TauToAlphaCen = 111e6 s = 3.5 years ~ 5.3 Tau1/2
so initially the rocket must be more than 31/32 fuel.

On the other hand, opals *cannot* take "high" temperatures. Part of
what makes an opal pretty is water trapped in the structure. If you dry
it out it looks more like chalk!

Also, because opals *require* water to form, they may not be the best
gem for this world. They form where heat and pressure allow the water
to dissolve large amounts of silica from the surrounding rocks, and it
gets deposited as zillions of tiny spheres, packed together. It\'s that
"packed together" bit that has so far prevented the production of
decent synthetic opal. The synthetics are "packed" but they\'ve been
created so "fast" that the spheres don\'t bond well. this results in a
tendency to crumble into powder under the least bit of mechanical
stress.

Opals need the lower pressure near the surface, but 2 km is "near the
surface". :-)

Slight problem. We could detect a stunt like that *now*. Geologists use
seismometers that will plot disturbances to within a few feet from
miles away. Tunneling *will* show up. Even if they managed to dig it
without making enough "noise" to be picked up, the tunnel itself will
stand out like a sore thumb whenever the scientists create "noise" to
plot the structure of the rock by plotting the echoes.

Better idea would be for the mining company to be trying to hide the
fact that they\'ve found some new type of mineral. Most likely a
gemstone (note: even "semi-precious stones" like jasper are worth money
if there\'s a lot of it, and it looks "pretty" enough). They are
(rightly!) concerned that the scientists would want to study the stuff
for a decade or two before allowing the miners to exploit the find.

This would be *especially* true if the deposit isn\'t big, and the
mineral is unique enough in appearance.

ps. to be a "gemstone" a mineral not only has to "look neat", but it
has to be hard enough that it doesn\'t get scratched in everyday
handling. That\'s why (for example) autunite, which is this *striking*
fluoresecent yellow color, *isn\'t* a gemstone. The stuff is about as
hard as gypsum, and tends to form in masses of tiny crystals to boot.
So it\'s *pretty*, but apt to turn into a yellow lump or worse yet, a
pile of yellow powder, if you tried using it for decoration.

pps. Cute idea a friend came up with once. I don\'t know if it is
possible, but it *sounds* neat. Uranyl silicate crystals. That is, a
silicate (quartz-like material), with a high percentage of uranium in
it. The part we weren\'t sure about was whether or not you could still
get a decently hard (and at least semi-transparent) crystal *and* have
it be radioactive enough to have an "inner glow" (from Cherenkov
radiation). You might need radium or one of the scarcer radioactives
instead of uranium to make it work.

I suspect the inestimable Doug has merely typo\'d above: the tides, through
friction between the oceans and ocean bottoms and between the crust and
the mantle, cause the Earth\'s rotation to _slow_down_.  The effect is
miniscule, except over geologic time.

Excellent ideas. I figure that roughly 5% of the cost of the weaponry
would be a reasonable amount to pay for bringing weaponry through
customs. What do you think? This provides the PCs with incentive to
get merc tickets quickly because those fees will bankrupt them after
a while.

Hmm does that mean that we still have to use devices like the ones the US

Wrong answer!, the TL-15 Xboat was jump-6, it is from several "canon"

I _hate_ to correct a Finn about Finnish military equipment, but the Lahti 9mm

we call here in the US a Luger.  There is a modest similarity in outward

Having fired both, taken them apart, and had each explained to me by my friend,
Col. Castonguay (who is also a gunsmith), it\'s a minor detail.
 
The Lahti 20mm anti-tank rifle was heavy and long, and had a semi-automatic

I just love this idea. They\'d be required to register with the local
authorities, file all sorts of paperwork, pay all sorts of fees and
get bogged down in administration. It cripples their ability to smuggle
and to be inconspicuous, both of which are important to these 
particular players.

These seem like small prices to pay for carrying kick-butt weaponry.

Well, yes and no.  This is real life, not a game.  The soviets had lower
tech, yes, this is true.  However, what the soviets did with that lower tech
is amazing (if you want to see what I mean, read up on soviet computer
programmers and it\'ll be clear).  However, we are pretty low tech as well,
where it counts.  Did you know that the NORAD complex (y\'know, the one from
"Wargames"?) hasn\'t had a full and satisfactory major upgrade since the 60s
(I cite last months Scientific American)?  That\'s late TL6 early TL7.  And
that\'s our early nuclear warning today.

Then again, take a look at Vietnam to see what guerilla warfare can do with
TL0/Tl1 sticks, traps, snares, tunnels, etc.

Yes, and the soviets also had the only MBT that had radiation shielding.
 Different developments on either side, and different ways of utilizing these
developments.  The soviets had a low-tech outlook on things, true.  But, that
attitude also got stuff done (Mir, first man spaced flight, only probe to
Venus, etc. etc.).  Stuff that America, with all its technology, couldn\'t do.

We in America let our technology make us fat and lazy.  The soviets combined
people and technology and got shit done.

Surely you jest?!?!?  Where did you dig up this figure?  Two things wrong
with the above statement...  Number one, never underestimate the power of
guerilla warfare vs. high-technology.  It is still extremely difficult, say,
to catch and kill a sniper with a high powered rifle in a window who fires
only one shot from each position.  Sure, we, (the U.S. that is), could
probably grind over alot of the world.  But in order to dominate, you have to
hold the territory.  Technology helps hold territory, but ultimately you need
people on the ground with guns.

Number Two:  Just because we have the most technologically advanced army in
the world doesn\'t mean that we have the most powerful.  Sure, we can bomb
everybody back to the stone age, but who cares?  So can Russia, So could
Britain and France...  The gulf war doesn\'t prove anything (desert terrain,
and WWII tactics versus super-high tech jet bombers and fighters will lose
every time) here.  Put American doughboys on the streets of U.S. occupied
London or Paris (or even Baghdad) and they\'ll be in trouble.  We don\'t have
the numbers, nor the heart to take over the world...

Not just the Guild; the Imperial Army, Navy & Marines will also require
registration & audit. The primary difference between a Merc unit and a
Pirate band is the length of time since the last pay day.

Each system under Imperial control into which they travel will probably
require they check in or register with the local Imperial Military command.

Some systems may restrict the activities of Merc units in ways different
than that for normal traders.  Extra inspections by the Customs units;
deatil review of all weapons held under the license and extra attention to
papers for any cargo. They may of shut themselves out of any \'small package
trade\' opportunties. Limitations on travel outside of the starport, the more
represive the government, the more nervious they become about Mercs roaming
among the potentially disaffected populace.

Unless they actually intend to limit themselves to Merc adventures, by
getting a Merc Guild membership under effective false pretenses; they have
effectively painted themselves bright red and donned strobe lights to draw
attecntion to themselves.

do not have a clean track record.  But there\'s a saying in the US Navy and
it goes like this:

	"YOU FIGHT LIKE YOU TRAIN."

If you train poorly, you fight poorly.  You can basically fight what you
train to fight.  etc..

We have not in the past nine years, do not currently, and will not for 
at least another decade train to do anything.  We do not practice invading
any particular nation.  Our entire navy, for example, is trained to fight
a "forward defense," which is distinct from a pure offense.  The aim is and has
been to deter conflicts and events not in the national security interests
of the US and its allies.  This may not have wonderful results all the time
but the intent is not malicious.

We defend our homes and our nation, for whatever we believe it to be worth.
"Against what?" you might ask.

Against Hitler, Stalin, and their ghosts.  Whoever wants to threaten us
next.  Its self interest, not total altruism (as you all know) that 
motivates US foreign and miitary policy.  Yet there\'s not a single sailor
that i\'ve met in my nine years of service that even thinks about 
"conquering the world."  It\'s an alien thought and an insulting one.

And we COULD NOT DO IT.  The US can DEFEND itself, but that\'s IT.  If
anyone was stupid enough to take on say, Europe, they would find themselves
in an immediate bloodbath.  The European militaries are professional and
sharp, and will soon be BETTER (if they aren\'t already) at the individual
quality and training level.  The military of the Gulf War no longer exists
in the US (but give us a few weeks)...

BTW, Harold made an interesting point about the multinationals.  long
with our lawyers, they are the ones interested in world (cultural) 
domination.  But what\'s wrong with that.

This might shed some light on the Imperium c.1116.  Fat dumb and happy
immediately after a successful, well-spun, hyped, and popular war abroad
which resulted in resounding military defeats but little resolution of 
the underlying problem.  A stagant and ever-more introspective empire
with strong divisive forces ready to rip it apart into Civil War.

All it takes it one catastrophic event...

I agree! I like this new scheme better -- more specific and descriptive.

I would like to see your Regency Rules of War. I also have several pages
of notes governing the Mercenary Guild, the Bonding Authority and the
Merc Code of Conduct. I\'ll be willing to provide such in the next few
days. We\'re on the same track here.

Hey, I could place an order for military grade weapons as long as I had
a dealer\'s license and the right export permits. And that\'s right here
in the US.

Just remember, with the right fees and permits, I could own a fully
operational *tank*. But using it for anything but rental to movie
companies, and maybe driving it out to the old miltary bomb range in
Boardman to "plink" at things with the guns would get me in big
trouble. Likewise, the paperwork for driving it out to the range would
be pretty impressive.

Having the weapons on your ship is "easy". Using them on all but the
lowest law level worlds will get your ass in a sling in a hurry. Also,
if *they* can get them, so can "the bad guys". :-)

Mercs own the heavy hardware because the folks they are fighting own the
same stuff!

That\'s what I was thinking as well, and there would probably be enough that
Vilani bloodlines might be severly diluted. The maintaining of a pure
solomani bloodline over 1000 years requires some speculation, but I suppose
it is possible, provided that there were enough Solomani administrators
imported during the breif time that Sylea was capital of the RoM. I imagine
that geneology is *very* important to some of the nobles of the Third
Imperium. 

I don\'t imagine for one minut that there aren\'t any Vilani or part solomani
nobles, I just wonder if they would be accorded any less status. The idea
that I am toying with in my campaing is that there is indeed a great deal
of prejudice against Vilani nobles, and that is the big sticking point that
the Vilani Confederation has agianst fully committing itself to the Third
Imperium. (In my campaing in year 10 they haven\'t yet joined, simply
because they are very worried about cultural domination)

But evem in a canon Imperium, I imagine that on many imperial worlds there
are Vilani "ghettos", where cultural as well as racial Vilani still proudly
live, for a long time.

Another question for anyone who\'s still reading... I seem to remember a
"solomani movement" among Imperial nobles until some emporer or other
married some vilani noble. 
Does anyone know (or for that matter think!) whether this Solomani movement
was present since day one. 

Personally I feel that this would go a long way toward explaining Solomani
attitudes, if you feel that you have the right to rule a lot of people who
are more than likely hostile, but accept your reasons for being in power,
then any threat to that power would seem to have dire consequences to you.  
hmmm... I think I\'ve rambled out loud enough now.

That may be true, but they were not the xboats that were in use.  I 
have a vague recollection a jump-6 system being studied but rejected 
- - most likely so the Imperium could keep a government/military jump-6
network with a significant lead-time over the public network.

How about if Commercial and private ships means ships whose highly paid

Conversly military ships might mean ships whose crews can be worked many
more hours per day and whose per hour per person cost is therefore
lower. It might also mean ships that are rigourously maintained,
Therefore evn if the crews of military ships are no more skilled than
those of commercial ships and their ships are no newer they may be get
higher performance.

Yes they need to be defined.  Maybe commercial means "a ship whose crew
pushes the right buttons and does whatever maintenance the manual says
they should.  "Maybe military means "a drive whose crew fiddles with it
a fair ammount." Maybe trained and tuned means "a ship whose well
trained crew is constantly fiddling with it."

> > Is the drive physically different?

If it is different it should have different specs and that will
needlessly complicate ship design so I suggest that the difference is
merely in the ammount of time the crew fiddles with it.  In this case a
"commercial" ship should be able to get "military" results if they are
willing to pay for them (maybe a 50% increase in personel costs to
reflect paying a civilian crew to work a 60 hour week while the military
figure assumes a crew working 60 hour weeks).

nukes the U.S.ed be in a heap of trouble ." 

I responded as above .

insulting some one about a view point I know nothing about . also john ,
I was in the gulf and I think I know the difference from a nuclear

My understanding was that South Africa had _had_ nukes.  I seem to
recall PT Botha saying as much.  I suspect that conventional estimates
of the number of countries with nuclear arms are somewhat understated. 
I would not be shocked to learn that there are 10 or more countries not
publically known to have nukes who do.  These countries would gain no
public benefit from admitting this as the leaders of the countries they
wish to deter presumably arleady know they have nukes.

For example if I were Canadian I would hope that my country had nuclear
weapons, as I cannot think of anything but my own nukes, or the threat
of British nukes, that would prevent the USA from conquering my country
easily. (Or at least the southern part with all the people and cities,
the mostly empty northern part might take a bit longer.) Oh sure the USA
says they are allied with Canada but nation states aren\'t what you would
call big on trust.  The USA has tried to invade Canada as recently as
1812 and might do so again.

As Tom Lehrer said:

"Who\'s Next"

One of the big news items of the past year concerned the fact that China,
which we call \'Red China\', exploded a nuclear bomb, which we called a
\'device\'.  Then Indonesia announced that it was gonna have one soon,
and proliferation became the word of the day.  Here\'s a song about that.

First we got the bomb and that was good,
\'Cause we love peace and motherhood.
Then Russia got the bomb, but that\'s o.k.,
\'Cause the balance of power\'s maintained that way!
Who\'s next?

France got the bomb, but don\'t you grieve,
\'Cause they\'re on our side, I believe.
China got the bomb, but have no fears;
They can\'t wipe us out for at least five years!
Who\'s next?

Then Indonesia claimed that they
Were gonna get one any day.
South Africa wants two, that\'s right:
One for the black and one for the white!
Who\'s next?

Egypt\'s gonna get one, too,
Just to use on you know who.
So Israel\'s getting tense,
Wants one in self defense.
"The Lord\'s our shepherd," says the psalm,
But just in case, we better get a bomb!
Who\'s next?

Luxembourg is next to go
And, who knows, maybe Monaco.
We\'ll try to stay serene and calm
When Alabama gets the bomb!
Who\'s next, who\'s next, who\'s next?
Who\'s next?

Who\'s Next is (c) 1965 by Tom Lehrer

This time increment seems a bit long.  DGP\'s MTJ #1 9pg 47 Dressed To
KIll by Tom Peters) says of BattleDress that it can be donned by the
average (skilled) trooper in about 10 minutes (a 1 minute time interval)
- - this time can be cut in half by use of an assistant or having the suit
in a mounting frame.  It seems to me that unpowered Combat Armor should
be no harder, and possibly easier than, Battle Dress to put on.  How
about a 30 second time interval.  On the other hand Battle Dress may
have power assisted closing features that Combat Armor would not so
maybe a 2 minute interval is correct.

I think that "routine" maintenance of combat armor should be Average not
Difficult (whats so hard about it ? ).  On the other hand it could be +2
Diff Mod for lack of proper tools or +1 Diff Mod if you have a Machine
shop on ship but do not have the exactly correct tools as made by the
maker of the Combat Armor (they could of course buy these tools for Cr
100,000 or so - if they can find them & get permission).

	Bravo , I agree with your post and because of your intellegent
and civil nature I will accept and bow to your obvious wisdom .
and now to the list ..
 2300Ad was a game I bought when I was a lowly 11M grunt in the U.S.Army
and it was a game I had hoped would be the answer to my gameing needs ,
disappointment can often breed resentment . I would have changed the
background but it was to ingrained into the book and would have called
for a rewrite [ if I wanted to write a game I wouldn\'t buy them . ] The
members of my gameing group lost interest and the game was filed away [ I
still have it ].
	understand one thing , when I was trying to run this game all of
the players and myself were 11M infantry men in the U.S. army and perhaps
because of the mindset we had we could not enjoy a game where ..
A. mexico conquered most of cali. and texas . and we never took it back !
B. the american arm was a bust while every other arm was full speed ahead

C. American equipment , personel and space program considered third rate.
as a matter of fact america is depected as a tired ol\'has been and pitied
by the rest of the world as exemplified by the quote in the book " Japan
looks to america as a fallen giant . " why did every nation in the world
recover better than the U.S. ?? 

call me Biased call me a liberal [ if from aussi ] a nationalist or a
rabid conservitive [ I hate rush . ] I have been all at one time or
another [ right now i am free market socialist]

IMTU mercenary units are licensed and regulated by the Imperial 
authorities.  Part of the license gives the Imperium (in the person 
of an authorised representative) the power to \'commandeer\' mercenary 
units in the case of emergency, even to the point of pulling them out 
of existing contracts.  This was used as part of the grand finale of 
our campaign, featuring the PC\'s as the only reachable imperial 
presence in a city surrounded by battling mercenary companies and 
under invasion from orbit.

The imperial licensing scheme meant that the PC\'s had good info about 
all of the merc companies around them (unit size, equipment, history 
etc), and knew which ones would respect that particular clause when 
confronted by a single imperial representative.

The other thorn in the collective sides of the merc companies is the 
presence of roving reporters from the "Mercenary! News Network - the 
Professionals\' choice".  Mercenary! keeps tabs on all imperial 
licensed merc companies, to the extent of requesting customer 
satisfaction reports from employers where possible, and on a roughly 
annual basis publishes the Mercenary! company league table.  This 
table ranks all licensed companies according to criteria such as 
training, equipment levels, discipline, adherence to the prevailing 
rules of conflict etc.  As a separate rating not counted for ranking 
purposes an overall customer satisfaction rating is given for each 
company, where available.  

The idea behind the league table is to give prospective employers a
general feel for the \'professionality\' (professionalness?) of the
various companies, along with an idea of how well they perform from
a subjective employers viewpoint.  The separation of the two rating 
means that you can find at a glance merc companies that are really 
the scum of the galaxy, but are very proficient at what they do - 
surely a staple of SF!

And it was a damn shame that Andropov had the poor taste to die, let Gorbachev
come to power, and ruin a perfectly good game background -- the 2nd ediition
"history" was just too far fetched, and that\'s why, I suspect, it has never been
(and probably never will be) resurrected.

Like many others outside of the continental US I grew up regarding the term
"American Culture" as an oxymoron. Now through exposure to numerous US
citizens (mostly naval personnel at Deep Freeze) I have learnt the error of
that line of thinking and that originating in the US does not automatically
make one a kneejerk redneck. However it would also appear from the above (and
other similar comments) that it also does not preclude the possibility.

(To the many US citizen who do not share such views, I apologise, but this
level of mindless jingoism is most distasteful and more than a little
insulting, especially since the a large portion of the allied blood spilt
in the Gulf was not US blood, just who was it who spent their time on
bombing the Iraqi runways again? and what was that Armoured unit attached
to the Marines?).

I might also enquire if you have considered that the US are firing Belgium
bullets (5.56mm SS109) from a Belgium SAW (Minimi). The US uses an Italian
handgun (Baretta M92F) firing a German round (9mm parabellum). The M1 uses
a German main gun (Rheinmetal 120mm) and British armour (Cobham), the Marines
fly a British strike aircraft (Harrier), the Coast Guard uses French
helicopters (Gazzele and Douphan), and I will only mention a few of the debts
to the RN of the USN carrier fleet (steam catapults, angled flight deck,
mirror landing system, arrester wires etc.). The list is really quite
extensive.

A yes, the Bundeswehr, the Army that makes nobody afraid. In fact the 
russians didn\'t believe that the majority of the Bundeswehr went home 
on weekends, they thought, we\'d be hiding somewhere to await their 
attack. The best time to take us on would be at about 13.00 hours on 
friday! Everybody would be on their way home, oblivious to the 
danger! ;-)

Not entirely true. You are called because your leader(s) can decide 
on taking action. We would be fully capable of doing the same job, 
could our politicians decide on a course of action. Sad, but true!

I went through a phase (about 8 years long) where I never bought a game
product. "If I wanted to play it; I\'d write it!" and that\'s exactly what I

and bought them. I bought almost everything for TNE, ran it and liked it.
Now I\'m buying T4 as it comes out, even though I\'m pretty sure that there
will be a better 2nd edition out sometime. Two of the 5 players I game with
are doing the same. That\'s 50% of our group, buying 70%+ of the material
EACH. If this is repeated elsewhere, then can you really see IG going
under? I can\'t.

Now, what IG needs is some support. Like the 101 books, but also other
stuff - as much product as possible to coming out to maintain interest. BUT
the product needs to be good; accurately proofread etc. I\'m willing to put
my money where my mouth is here and write that material, proof it;
whatever. Licensed products might be an excellent idea. They have the
advantage of not taking up IG time and being more product top grab
attention. But what do people think?

On an unrelated subject: does weaponry dictate doctrine or the other way
around? Or is it a bit of both? I think the latter. The Soviets, with their
\'TL6\' gear, had a defensive doctrine based upon the elimination of threats.
Look at their tanks: hard work to operate, but well protected, reliable
(mostly) and difficult to hit. They were designed for a massed assault,
with helicopters acting as \'flying tanks\' in support. Compare to NATO and
US vehicles. Far more comfortable and thus less tiring to operate (rumors
that the M1 has a swimming pool in the back are false. It\'s a tennis
court.), the tanks of the West are designed to give greater value \'per
tank\' but are poorer value for money - though how do you rate that? With
their higher turrets etc, Western vehicles are excellent on the defensive,
but make good targets in the massed advance - they\'re still rather good,
though. 

These weapons reflect doctrine. They could have been designed differently,
but they suit the needs of the nation doing the designing. Soviet gear was
excellent for its purpose, especially when one considers that it had to be
operated and maintained by poorly trained conscripts for the most part,
with many cultures and languages present in the army. The best tank in the
world is no use if your troops have broken it.
	
The Gulf War comparison is thus a little unfair, as are all comparisons of
this type. Warfare, by its definition, is unfair. If it\'s fair, someone is
doing something badly wrong! The Gulf saw just about the entire world gang
up on Iraq. Numbers were, just for once, on the side of the technologically
advanced side. After the initial paranoia, it became clear that my cat
could have won the Gulf War with those weapons. What the Gulf War proved
was that the Coalition could beat Iraq. And that Tomahawk really is as
deadly as we thought! But far-reaching conclusions like \'soviet gear was
crap\' should rank with \'the bomber always gets though - any war can be won
by air power alone. The army and navy are obsolete\' etc.

Imagine that the Coalition had been armed with Soviet gear, and Iraq with
western arms. What then? The strategy used historically would almost
certainly have failed, because it relied upon technological advantages. But
a massed assault, with overwhelming firepower, along a broad and deep axis
of advance... i.e. a Soviet approach? It might have worked.

Yes, Soviet weapons were inferior, unit for unit. But it never works out like that. 
It comes down to what you\'ve got, and how you use it.
The Eagle is an incredible aircraft. But bomb its airfield and it can\'t take off.
The Abrams is a great tank. Cut off its ammunition or fuel supplies and it\'s a big target.
Supercarrier groups are a tremendous way of projecting power in the
non-nuclear world. A ballistic missile would take the lot out and MIGHT not
lead to escalation.


I bet anyone, any money, that I could defend the rest of the world against
the USA, indefinitely. maybe even my cat could. I\'m not demeaning the USA -
they have the best kit in the world, and I\'m bloody glad we\'re on the same
side. But they couldn\'t take over the world by military means. Not in two
or a thousand years. They couldn\'t keep it if they did. 

There are other ways; economic and cultural conquest, for example. 
Those might work. But not military.

One other thing. Look at Mogadishu, for example. The USA isn\'t very good at
taking casualties. All that technology and firepower has led to a situation
where the taking of casualties shakes morale. It\'s unacceptable to a public
used to easy victory. That public could perhaps be manipulated into backing
a war effort. But they\'d never stand for the losses, even without the
missiles.

Hrm. . . typically, if you\'ve got some sort of central clearing house 
for mercenaries, it\'s going to largely act as a go-between between 
employers (potential and actual) and mercenaries.  So if they are going 
to register with that, they\'ll get all sorts of nosey questions about 
what sort of troops they have and what capabilities they have so that 
the guild can hook them up with potential employers.  If the PCs have 
three ACRs and Scout ship, I\'d expect them to get laughed out of the 
guildhall.  The guild would also hold the pay of mercenaries until the 
contract is completed, guarding against breach of contract on either 
side, and ensuring that if the mercenaries don\'t get home, the pay is 
distributed to their next of kin.  Remember, Mercenaries aren\'t much 
loved by their employers.  They get the shit jobs (OK, now you pin down 
the enemy armored division while we sneak around it\'s flank) at the 
lowest rates of pay the market will bear.  If the PCs expect to get 
rich, they are better off running a normal passenger route.  And since 
they are mercenaries, yeah they run around with military weapons--so 
does anyone they come in contact with.  Any employer with the 
wherewithal to hire mercenaries will be able to get military weapons, 
and you don\'t hire mercs to deal with anything but military problems.  
And if the GM is a better tactician than the PCs, they are kinda 
fucked.  Also think about the social status of mercenaries.  In most 
nations they are somewhere between doggie doo and the green stuff 
floating in an aquarium.  They will be considered a necessity, but an 
unpleasant one that has a tendency to turn on it\'s masters.  Feel free 
to have them followed by an undercover agent of the local law-just in 
case.  Also expect them to have to register with each and every 
locality they go to, answering nosey questions, (\'And which one of the 
upstanding citizens of Westbumfickia thinks he\'s hiring mercenaries?\' 
is not a conversation they want to get into as they travel from the 
mainland to an island with a history of rebellion against said 
mainland).  If they travel to another planet, and their arsenal is 
discovered (Customs Inspection!) they\'ll have to explain that, and if 
their explanation is that they are mercenaries, they could have quite a 
bit of explaining to do.  And also, a lot of opponents don\'t exactally 
consider mercenaries deserving of the same consideration as opposing 
soldiers.  If a regular soldier is captured, he may end up in a POW 
camp.  If a mercenary is captured, he\'s typically shot on the spot.  
The exception is when both sides are employing a number of mercenaries, 
in which case there are likely to have grown up elaborate traditions 
regarding surrender and repatriations.  Exactally how mercenary 
intensive are the wars in your campaign?

Let\'s be realistic.  If a _real_ starting commandoe unit couldn\'t come 
up with it. . . Otherwise it\'s jerking with the players just to be 
jerking with them.  Feel free to arrange things so that they are stuck 
with either accepting real contracts or going bankrupt, but don\'t rig 
it so the poor bastards are automatically bankrupt.  Not to mention the 
health hazards of trying to play Mercenary Guild representatives (Whose 
best friends own grav tanks) for fools, if they did lie through their 
yellow buck teeth to them.

Daily, require simple 10 minutes.  Once a week, require a difficult.  
After a fight in which the suit gets shot at (not penetrated), require 
difficult.  If someone blows a hole in it, then it requires specialized 
tools which I doubt they have.

	Thanks Victor, I stand corrected. I\'ve never handled either handgun

Are you trying to tell me it will cause problems with overloading the 
life support to move through a starship firing SMGs and grenade 
launchers?  That raises the question of what the Guild was thinking 
when it designed the Decksweeper.  (Yes, TNE.)  If that\'s what a gang 
of pirates considers ideal, then it can\'t cause too many problems.  Now 
if our heros decide to acquire high energy weapons, then I can see 
problems, or if they unload a 4cm grenade into a bridge workstation, 
but other than that.  Unless you are tossing around more WP than anyone 
ever needs, I can\'t see the little bit of stuff put out by a hand-held 
weapon to be a problem.

I suppose I should render my apologies for using non-canon technobabble 
during an earlier set of posts re: GT.  A couple of quick points, to 
assuage inflamed feelings.

* InvalidateRect is a term any Microslave programmer should be passingly 
familiar: it\'s the Winders API func that allows a particular rectangle to 
be repainted (often misused by AOL and Apple/Quicktime programmers: the 
same people?).  Hence the reference to Loren\'s T IV, which will "repaint", 
in essence, a huge segment of Traveller \'history\'.  Yeah, yeah, it\'s an 
\'alternate\' time line, whatever.  The judge and a few intellectual 
property attorneys reviewing the contract might believe that, but I\'m more 
concerned with it\'s actual RealWorld(tm) effect on the Traveller 
community, present and future.

* T IV and HIV and Virus.  The connection should be clear, but perhaps 
it\'s not to the over-sensitive/zealous (one and the same?).

Anyway, folks, I was *trying* to express a little humor and my opinion at 
the same time: what I would like to see is GT do everything from CT to MT 
to TNE.  An alternate universe, IMNSHO, will damage Traveller; a little 
healthy revision, reprinting, and new material will not.  It\'s a time 
honored practice for RPG companies to "revise and reprint" as 2nd+ 
editions.  How many has AD&D had?  And "it\'s still alive"...  I don\'t 
think anyone would have a single complaint (zealots aside) if SJG would 
begin printing MT and TNE materials as GURPS supplements.

*sigh*  I don\'t personally like the GURPS system, but I have a great deal 
of respect for SJG\'s ability to produce (I may even try a supplement for 
them; they actually like outside authors.)

Perhaps I should begin encapsulating all of my posts with <humor> tags or 
smileys, commenting my posts, in a sense, in order to preserve some sense 
of perspective/humor.

As for GT not "invalidating" anything in the sense that MT/HT/TNE won\'t go 
away (already having been printed), true \'nough, ignoring the 
"assimilation effect" of GURPS (if there is one).  Perhaps Marc and 
company look on MT et al as "failed" since it didn\'t really catch fire in 
the RPG market.  *shrug*  However, I, for one, would like to see NEW stuff 
for the Rebellion and Hard Times eras.  (Okay, no need to tell me to go 
write it...  Some of us have day jobs, too.)

Another excellent idea. I think what I\'ll end up doing is coming up

I picked two minutes because I thought (from my faulty memory) that
the MT rules used that interval for Vacc Suits. I could be wrong.
It seems to me that Combat Armor and Vacc Suits require the same time
to put on. I\'ll have to check.

The potential damage that can be caused by a merc outfit will easily
run into the millions. A MCr10 deposit does not seem unreasonable.
Granted, the group won\'t be able to come up with that number, so the
Merc Guild could loan them the deposit and use the title to their
ship as collateral. That should keep things affordable.

I don\'t agree that this is excessive. It\'s a Simple task, after all.
So, if you have no Vacc Suit or Battle Dress skill, the task is
Routine. If you are skilled, you\'d need snake eyes on the dice to
blow it. How is that excessive?

rifle based on a real life design by a company called Pauza Specialities,
which also makes .50 BMG cal rifles, and .50 cal pistols (no, _NOT_ BMG,
but the .50 Action Express round. It\'s actually a Ruger Super Blackhawk
conversion) 

Their website is: http://members.aol.com/RPauza/index.html

(For those of you who keep track, yes it _is_ a rerun...I posted this way
back last spring when I found the Pauza site) I am going to redo this in a
five shot SA version, and also do it in FFS2, just for the heck of it, to
see what I get.

Karolan Industries \'Vindicator\'AMS Rifle 20 mm TL-8

	Th Vindicator is a single shot, 20 MM infantry anti-materiel
sniper weapon. Typically employed in two man, shooter/spotter teams, this
weapon can be extremely effective at very long ranges. Slug, and DS rounds
are currently available. Typical targets include vehicles, BD equipped
personnel, fixed sensor emplacements, etc. 

	These guns can be employed at extreme ranges, a DS round has an
effective range of up to 3 kilometers, a slug up to 450 meters.

	The game statistics are as follows:

Round 	Dmg	TL	Range	Shots	Mass	Reloads	Cost

Slug	7	8	Long	1	30.3	.37 kg	8220
DS	8	8	Ex Long	1	30.3	.23 kg	8220	

	This was an effort to produce the same RL design I posted
yesterday, using 3G3 for the design system; actually I used the 3G3
spreadsheets to do it.

The physical stats are as follows:

Part		3G3	RL (estimated from the GIF, or from the stats)
Barrel		96 	96 cm
Reciever 	13 	25 cm
Stock		30 	27 cm
Weight		30.3	22 kg

There are obviously things you can do to optimize weight that aren\'t
calculated by either 3g3 or FFS. 

Put some of these things in the hands of natives, and your BD equipped
marines are going to have a real hard time of it.

Of course, since augumented BD has additional strength, it\'s possible for
them to start carrying things like this as their standard sidearm, or at
least a standard squad weapon.

Can someone post real life stats, or web or literature references to
either the Lahti or the Boys? (I\'d _heard_ of the Boys .55 caliber round,
by reference in 3G3, but I sort of assumed it was an old elephant gun
round for some reason)

	Actually, no, compound interest doesn\'t affect inflation because it 
doesn\'t affect the money supply.  To use the above "Gilligan\'s Island" 
economy as an example again:
	If you borrow a dollar from me and I say that you have to give me 
back two in a year, you have to get the extra dollar from someone else in 
order to pay me back.  So there are still the same number of dollars in 
our economy and we have not created inflation.  Now, if you counterfeited 
this extra dollar, and I didn\'t know it, or you otherwise paid me back 
with currency acquired elsewhere, that would increase the money supply 
and lead to inflation.

> In a perfect world were coconuts are commodities and money is just a
> medium of exchange, interest would be noncentsical (sp?) <BG>

	In the "Gilligan\'s Island" economy, interest would still make 
sense.  If you had one dollar, you could buy one coconut.  But say you 
wanted two and weren\'t willing to save up to get it?  Well, I could loan 
you the dollar to buy the coconut.  But why should I?  After all, I like 
coconuts, too.  What happens is that I let you borrow my dollar, but only 
if you pay me for the privelage.  So when you give me back my dollar, you 
also give me back an extra 10 cents. Since I prefer 1.1 coconuts next 
year to 1 coconut this year, I accept your offer.
	While consumer borrowing is significant, business borrowing is 
much more important for the long-term health of an economy.  If you 
borrowed the dollar to buy a coconut so that you could plant it and grow 
another coconut tree, this would increase the total wealth (cocnuts) in 
the economy.  Even if you didn\'t share your coconuts with anyone, at 
least one person (you) would be better off.  
	So to close the circle, the bank pays you interest so that you
will agree to loan the bank money (deposit it in an account).  The bank
turns around and loans the money to a business.  The business invests the
money in coconuts which it plants to grow more coconut trees.  When the
trees mature, its sells the coconuts for dollars.  It keeps some of the
dollars as profit, and gives the rest to the bank to pay back the loan. 
The bank uses the interest on the loan to the business to pay you your
interest on the money you deposited.
	There\'s only one problem.  There are now more coconuts in the 
economy than before, so we are going to get deflation.  This is where the 
Central Bank steps in and prints a few more dollars to correspond to the 
new coconuts.  Creating exactly as many new dollars as there are new 
coconuts keeps the price level constant.

I do have a few questions/comments from memory:

(1)  What design system did you use for the ships and did you give them 
any kind of "mass production" discount like that given QSDS ships?

(2)  Why did you choose 3% as the "fair profit" on the ship owner\'s 
investment?  Why does his investment get a lower return than the banks?  
The ship owner, as the entrepreneur, is taking a much greater risk than 
the bank.  After all, the bank can always reposses the ship to recover 
its money, but he will not get his 20% back.  Riskier investments require 
higher rates of return.  For simplicity, I would make the "fair profit" 
and the interest on the bank loan the same.

I might have an easier method for designing lasers soon.  I am just about
done with it and will release it probably in a few weeks.  However it will
only run on windows95 and maybe windows3.1.

However I don\'t know the answer to your question, I haven\'t gotten to the

I\'m thinking of the atmosphere in an indoor firing range, where my eyes are
watering and my nose is running, and then imagining what it would be like
if the space were half the volume, and the air was recycling in a closed
loop.  Military vessels nmay be able to handle such things, but a civvie
ship?  Yes, I think with enough gunfire the life support may start choking
on particles of burnt and unburnt gunpowder.  That doesn\'t begin to explore
what happens when a grenade goes off (I\'ve never been anywhere near such an
event, but I assume there is a lot of particulate matter expelled into the
local atmosphere...and I mean the small pieces, not the big ones).

My opinion differs.  I think that a large handgun or .45 caliber submachine
gun will cause a significant breathing hazard if frequently and repeatedly
fired in an enclosed space over the course of a 5-10 minute battle.

Ok, lets take a RL scenario.  Take this gun...go on take it.  Ok lets get
into my 747 here...watch the step...now I\'ll have the pilot take us to 40k
feet.  Good.  Ok take shot at the bottom of the cabin.  No problem right?
Wrong.  Ignoring the problems of a hull breach (The analogy breaks down at
the hull since starship hulls are obviously well armored) you\'ve just split
open the hydrolic line from the cockpit to the wing.  Or perhaps you\'ve
severed a
fuel line, or maybe just the "waitress call" button.  In any case, I have
my lightweight parachute handy during the whole experiment.

The fact is a starship and an airplane (and an orbital facility, and an
air/raft...) are complex mechanical and electronic machines.  They are not
armored on the inside (wasted weight is wasted money) so any reasonable
round will simply pass through the inner skin and hit the outer (where it
may, in fact, ricochet back in).  In the process it will part any soft
items, such as electronic control systems, coolant conduits, hydrolic
tubing, wires, lighting fixtures, etc. etc., which get in the way.  Taking
unreasonable rounds, like those from a 30 caliber machine gun and spewing
them about the cabin of a starship will have multiple such effects, which
can be both dangerous and expensive.

Now, it would take a real weapon (Armor Piercing GL, which I\'ve seen
characters waving around in ships before)to pierce the liquid hydrogen
storage tank, but I bet the feed lines are less well armored!  The point
is, bullets do things.

Unless it hasn\'t been properly maintained, in which case the character
dislocates his shoulder while trying to move, and then gets stuck in place
when the hydrolics shut down, leaving him stranded inside a half a ton of
superdense.

I believe that the other person who posted was absolutely correct.  Imperial
XBoats were Jump-4, not Jump-6.  Two examples:

"Supplement 9:  Fighting Ships"
p12

"Performance: Jump-4. 0-G (no maneuver). No power plant (and consequently no
energy points and no agility)."

"Megatraveller: Imperial Encyclopedia"
p24

"...making the speed of communication nearly the speed of jump (since XBoats
carry jump-4 drives, speeds near four parsecs per week)."

AIUI, \'man\' is a neutral term, and refers to the race (ie mankind). \'woman\' 
is feminine, and refers to females of the species. There is no masculine 
term, so we hijacked \'man\'. \'Rule of Man\' is a perfectly correct name.

Sure, I would be very interested in such things.  My source is Traders and
Gunboats, Supplement 7, CT.

Also (I Think) Starships, Book 3, CT.

I believe that the Megatraveller Encyclopedia repeated that trend, but I
may be wrong.  In any case, a jump 6 xboat network invalidates the cute
little trick in the rebellion era when Norris knew of the assassination of
Strephon before the rest of the domain.  This occurred, according to, I
think, The Rebellion Sourcebook, through the use of the Imperiallines
covert imperial courier ships which *were* J6.

I do not recall whether they were TL15.  I seem to think they were TL14
which was more common in that era anyway, especially among the scout
service vessels.  A military courier was in Fighting Ships (Supplement 9)
and that may have been jump 6 and TL15.

Is that a problem?  Sorry, I don\'t have the book and you seem to be
implying that this should be obvious.  a 2t vessel wont be very useful
since it has no passenger space, but perhaps a "scooter" for moving around
the outside of a ship could be 2t with just a seat.  I am not familiar
enough with the material to understand why this is an error.

You didn\'t say, above, that *TL5* (little boy, fat man) and TL15 were the
same.  At a certain point there is little mass or volume to be saved since
the control components are as small as they will get and the other major
component, the plutonium or other "hot stuff" has to be a certain size to
reach "critical mass".

At TL9 the whole device should be pretty small, perhaps as small as it
gets.  You did not actually post the figures, only assumed that no one had
looked at it and that the authors had simply tried to lift the table from
striker, and failed.

Personally, I cannot understand why there is a table for nukes at all.  I
cannot see implementing the game effects and making a determination other
than "target destroyed" if a hit is made with a nuke warhead (short of
starship combat anyway).  I suppose it would be nice to know how much of
the city is left (blast radius), or what direction the wreckage flies off
in, but tis all pretty moot.  I would implement the results in a less
structured way myself.  I suppose there is an argument for completeness, or
land-battleship combat (ala Bolo), but that\'s not really very
travelleresque.  Oops, got into a tangent there.

>You really don\'t know me this is rather pleasant for me, you see some of my

Actually, I know that you can draw the line between friendly argument and
downright animosity.  I was just trying to say I thought you\'d gone too far
towards the latter.

        No, but it does mean, for example, that a TL-20 internal combustion
engine has approximately the same characteristics as a TL-8 internal
combustion engine. You can reach a limit of improvement for any specific
device independent of tech increases.

Different developments on either side, and different ways of utilizing these

I agree with most what you are saying about "let us be proud of America
but not cram "America" down everyones gut" but feel the need to point
out a few points on your above statement.

One.  The Apollo missions were no small cheeze--if fact I might even say
that those involved-"got stuff done".

Secondly, seeing as there is a lot of space in space, there are lots of
places to send probes--even back then US probes went to places the USSR
probes did not.  Different space agencies probably have a different
outlook on proritizing mission destinations.

Finally, while I don\'t have any numbers, I have heard that in its
endevors the expendability of human life was not as great a factor as in
the US (space prog. for example--before challenger we had only lost
three people (in an early apollo mission if I remember correcly).  As I
said, I don\'t have any absolute numbers...but just from talking with
people from the former Soviet Union its seems their numbers mign=ht be a
little higher.)  Given the choice...whos program would you have wanted

learning about their product in this course.  It is an Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) targeting cross-platform uses on Windows and Macintosh
machines.  (The code is completely portable between them, and is run
interpretively.)

As many GUI builders go, you have to have their software, or (I assume) at
least an application presentation package, installed on each machine that
the application is to be run on, so we are not talking software that you
could easily share with friends, etc.

Listening to Rob Prior posting that his Mac software may be ported for the
MS-Win environment, and remembering how GDW (early 80\'s) had asked me if I
could port their programs (CT) to the PC environment (I held back my
laughter not wanting to embarass them), I thought about the possibility
that there might be a group with access (at work, or wherever) to the
software that would be required to use a library I could build for
Traveller software [my particular forte being centered around world
generation/development/storage].

As many companies do, OMNIS claims client/server technology, which if true
could conceivably result in the concept of a central database, that those
with WWW access, might be able to reach.  That is just one idea that comes
to mind.

Panama and Grenada are both smaller that 75% of our states, and the total
size of their armed forces is somewhat under what we give to just one of
our flag officers.  Iraq was worrysome, but the air war preceding the
ground war destroyed their C&C, devastated the armor they had in place,
and reduced the morale of their troops to the point that they were
surrendering to the ROVs put out by the USS IOWA. And while training
taught me that one of our surface ships was the equivalent to 5 Soviet
surface vessels, research showed me that in the late eighties, there was
something like an 8 to 1 disparity (over 13 when you count in the merchant
marine), a high percentage of which were attack submarines (which have a
higher \'kill rate\' against surface craft).

I am not familiar with the current state of the European military, so I
will not comment on that.  But recent history shows that the German
military is good enough to take on a large percentage of the *World*,
repeatedly, fight on multiple fronts, and do pretty darn well.

I\'m glad you mentioned brain washing, now I don\'t have too!  :)  

Seriously tho\', what else can you tell someone that is being trained to
ignore self-preservation and place themselves in a position to get
themselves killed in a variety of very nasty ways?  "We\'re second best,
but we try harder?"  I don\'t think so.  

No disrespect to your service or your training, but you are immersed in a
culture and lifestyle that reinforces your beliefs.  \'Gung-ho\' \'Ooo-Ra\'
etc.  It\'s a necessary part of your psyche to do what you do, but it
doesn\'t reflect real-world reality.

Don\'t underestimate your enemy, that\'s what I was taught.  Question what
is known, form hypotheses, based on evidence not hype, and verify what you
can.  If you convince yourself that you (and our armed forces) are the
best, then how can you possibly respect what other forces, say the British
SAS, Russian Spetznaz (sp?), Japanese self-defense forces, etc... have to
show us?

I think it is indisputable that manning levels for all the armed forces
have been cut, to what I consider critical levels.  (What is the current
multi-conflict doctrine anyway?  I know it is no longer Win/Win)

I think it is also indisputable that operational budgets have shrunk over
the past few years, while operational commitments maintained or increased.
My last year in the Nav (3 years ago) I kept hearing how training and
maintenance funds were being diverted to operational funding.

And gosh, having spent a *short* time as a drilling reservist, I saw that
the reserve forces are being called up in ever increasing numbers to
offset the shortfall of active duty units.  As a matter of fact, a friend
of mine in the Army Reserve has been called for duty in Bosnia, another
acquaintence just got back.  Again, another reservist.

Well, I certainly did.  Prospects were better in the Civilian world than

do for my family now.

The satellite in question was launched prior to the war, and contained
important meterological data.  The United States was nuked in 1997, invaded
by Mexico and the Soviet Divison Cuba, and had a three way civil war going
with the majority of its military stranded overseas.

Hardly a situation given to world domination.

Remeber the adventure "Going Home"?  The US had to scrape together a few
ships for the last evacuation of US troops out of Europe.. there wasn\'t
going to be another one!  US tropps in the Persian Gulf were stranded until
about 2005 when the French finally evacuated them.

The majot US metropolitan areas were either nuked or severely depopulated
by 2000 (ref: "Howling Wildnerness")  I think Tampa, Fl. was one of the
largest cities left on the eastern Seaboard, and it was run by New America!

I\'m a veteran and politacally active, and I find no problem at all with the
scernario as presented in 2300AD.

Go back 300 years.  In 1697, the two powers that dominated the world were
Spain and England.  They *owned* the seas, there influence was everywhere.
In Europe, Sweden was a feared military power.  There was no such thing as
Germany or Italy (as single nations).  Japan was still a fuedalist,
isolationist mystery.

To a man of the late 17th Century, the thought that in 300 years the two
greates powers would be a rebellious British colony and the post-Czar
peasents of Russia would seem to be as a bsurd as claiming that men could
walk on the Moon!

Open your perspectives a little, it really helps.

    'body' => 'I recently observed that the GURPS: Traveller announcement did not portend
well for Traveller "canon" as the \'net seems to know it.  A simple one line
comment on HIWG list lead to a whole _sh_t-storm of discussion (not flames
by the way) about "canon" replete with the usual, "If canon is out the door,
then so am I ..." and similar responses.  There were also the oblique (and
some less so) references to "what I want to do with the history of the
Traveller universe, vis-a-vis the Rule of Man Tech Level discussion
(c.\'97, Summer, TML).

Somewhat tangentially, just today in lecture for my "SOC-2462 Introduction
to Social Psychology" course, taught by Dr. Jon Winterton (UCD\'s Sociology
program is rated in the top five in the United States), this illustrious,
enjoyable, and self-proclaimed socialist, said on the subject of Human
Information Processing, specifically on messages (paraphrasing my notes):

   "Messages provide generalization. ... Information arises in the
    process of making choices (in a relationship, both sides have
    to have choice) ... Information is transmitted -- you can not,
    not [that is two nots in a row, not a typoe] send information,
    refusing to communicate _is_ sending a message"

   "Information changes the state of the organism [i.e. individual]
    When we make discoveries, everything changes, or the change is
    not believed, i.e. the Big Thompson Canyon flood from a few years
    ago."  He then relayed the story about a mountain canyon flood of
    a few years ago.  A policeman at the bottom of the canyon,
    received advance information that a flow was propagating down
    the canyon.  He gave his life, driving up the canyon to warn
    people that their lives were in danger.  These people, in some
    cases had 60 seconds to decide whether to flee their cars and
    head for high ground or not.  There were some people who did not
    flee and are not with us now.

I finally have received at least _some_ insight into why a few people on
the lists seemed to think that I was totally wacko with an assertion about
scant and slim references about the history of the Traveller Universe.

With little fact to go on, and a lot of information seemingly conflicting,
we make choices of information interpretation.  In this case, no life
was at risk, but old interpretations of vagueries were.  I shall continue
to question assumptions, look for a common unifying understanding rather
than make one assumption and then look ascance at subsequent evidence to
the contrary.

We can concoct elaborate theories about what the motivation or origin of
some source is, but it boils down to theocracy.  Bearing that in mind,
Merriam Webster\'s Collegiate Dictionary, 10th edition says:

<Quote>

A  (1) canon - (before 12th Century):

        1 a : a regulation or dogma decreed by a church council
          b : a provision of canon law (see below)
        2   : the most solemn and unvarying part of the Mass including
              the consecration of the bread and wine
        3 a : an authoritative list of books accepted as Holy Scripture
          b : the authentic works of a writer
          c : a sanctioned or accepted group or body of related works
              <the ~ of great literature>
        4 a : an accepted principle or rule
          b : a criterion or standard of judgement
          c : a body of principles, rules, standards, or norms
        5 a : a contrapuntal musical composition in two or more voice
              parts in which the melody is imitated exactly and completely
              by the successive voices though not always at the same pitch

B  (2) canon

        1 a : a clergyman belonging to the chapter or the staff of a
              cathedral or collegiate church
        2   : canon regular (see below)

C      canon law - (1552 AD)

            : usually the codified law governing a church

D      canon regular - (14th Century)

            : a member of one of several Roman Catholic religious
              institutes of regular priests living in a community under
              a usually Augustinian rule

<End of Quote>

Whoever coined the usage of "canon" to describe the language of TML either
didn\'t know just _how_ telling that was, or they set you all up.

Personally, I wouldn\'t fall in the trap of interpreting that little white
space between the words of the books we pour over to be all that filled
in.  There are vast rifts ripe for the imagination.  Just don\'t get too
set on making the "law" for those not present.  You may just find a
classic revolt in the making.

It does give rise to a whole new class of Religious Dictatorship for
Traveller. <G>

Maybe this sheds light on my earlier (paraphrased) comment, "You want canon,
you kissa da Pope\'s hand--you try to bite it, you get da wrath of heaven."

You\'re analogy is a good one, but use a submarine instead of an
airplane. Why? Because subs, like starships, have internal bulkheads
that are very solid. In MT rules, you need 250 points of damage to
one to create a man-size hole (a breach). A handgun will do squat to
one of those.

Now, I assume that pipes, cabling and other equipment would be found
either inside the bulkhead (if the components are small enough) or
generally away from the living areas (for aesthetic reasons). The risk
of firing a handgun in one of the living areas and causing serious
damage is minimal. Letting loose in Engineering, though, is another
matter.

The Soviets lost four cosmonauts directly related to missions, either in

If you are in the US, you might try contacting the local BATF office
and asking for a copy of the regulations and "tax schedule" for owning
fully automatic weapons and "destructive devices". Tell them you are
doing research for a book (close enough to reality, and easier for them
to understand than the longer explanation).

As I recall, the fees *start* at something like $1000-5000 for a simple
machinegun and go up rapidly. And the regulations are rather
cunbersome. Just the thing to bug players with. :-)
(And if they complain that your regs are "unrealistic", you can show
them a copy of the *real* laws here :-)

Interest is a *service*, rather than a good. Specificly, Interest is
the fee you get paid for the "service" of allowing the bank to use your
money. They make loans, collect interest on them, and part of that
interest gets paid to you.

Likewise, interest on a loan is the price you are paying to use someone
else\'s money.

Like I said, it\'s no sillier than getting paid for providing any other
service. 

I\'m amazed at the number of people who don\'t understand this. Of
course, most people tend to think of money as being real in and of
itself, rather than a means of "keeping score" in the economy.

I have played many games of \'general\' theme, ala Traveller and AD&D and \'canon\' is nice,

If _I_ remember right, there were two types of XBoats (in 1116).

These were Jump-6, and were (for eg) how Noris knew about the assassination

Having experienced both Naval vessels and Luxury Liners, I would tend to
disagree with you.  Naval and Scout vessels will not cover up their
piping, wire conduits, and the like (except where contact with those
components represents a safety hazard) for two reaons.  1) Access to those
components for maintenance and damage control and 2) (possibly the
overriding reason) It costs money to cover those components and these
ships are built by _the_lowest_bidder_!  Cargo vessels would be mixed, but
I\'ve yet to see a cargo ship on the ocean that looked like it had any but
the most basic of maintence performed on it.  I tend to think that, if
there is any construction/design difference, it would be that the safety
items may be omitted to save money...  Passenger-carrying vessels are
another class entirely - how they look and feel will, to a great extent,
determine how profitable they are.  The one liner I\'ve been on (visiting
from a cruiser, it was quite a shock) looked more like a high class hotel
than a ship, from the inside.

Still, from the point of damage, I imagine that the panels covering the
electrical and fluidic components are not that thick, and these components
would be vulnerable to damage on any class of ship.

On the bright side, many of the more dangerous pipes (H2 supply, high
pressure air) would be covered with an insulation which could easily be
made of a ballistic cloth.  High power conduits would tend to be waveguide
or some equivalant technology (fairly safe unless it\'s pointed at you,
otherwise think of standing in front of a high energy rf transmitter).
Most electronic systems will be redundant.

On the dark side, most insulations we use today have really nasty fumes
when they burn, as do most of the lubricants we use.  I don\'t see that
changing much.  Additionally, high pressure systems are dangerous (even
with TL 7 technology we developed 1200 PSI propulsion systems where a leak
will cut you in half), and starships will have those in abundance (for
example, landing gear).

Another interesting thought is how the ship itself will react to damage.
The computer monitors and reacts to situations constantly, and even
without anti-hijack running, there can be consequences.  Supposing a
hijacker uses a grenade in the common room.  How does the computer react
to a hull breach?  Or to fire?  Or to toxic gases?  Any of the above would
be appropriate.

An important point with any future history game is that it is very hard to
tell when a country is gong to go sour.  I personally think the excessive
emphasis on higher education for jobs which do not require it, coupled with
draining the talent which makes higher education worthwhile out of the
classrooms and into the research laboratories is going to produce ever less
trained students.  These ever less competent students and citizens are a
far bigger threat than anything else I see facing us.

Consider - the vast majority of the high school teachers have had perhaps
one physics class in college.  At most universities, that course is taught
by a graduate student who, it is presumed, does not have the experience or
the training to be a full professor yet.  Often, the grad student teaching
a course may have taught it at most once or twice before.  (TA appointments
are usually only given to young grad students.)  In many cases, the grad
students are foreign and have learned the language relatively recently,
making it less likely that the information will be transferred to the
students.  (NB nationality is not important, but total time speaking the
language is very important.  The two Japanese and the Korean I work with
here all write exceedingly well in English, but one of them speaks English
as a native, while the other two are very diffident about the language, and
do not have full speaking fluency.)

This kind of thing results in most people having never had a competently
taught science course, because the people who might have taught their
teachers are often not terribly good.  Similar tales abound in history,
philosophy, mathematics, and other subjects.  As a result, we will end up
losing a number of years of productivity from our citizens to no good purpose.

How does this relate to jingoism and patriotism?  Without the hard data to
judge from people are forced to make some rather important judgements based
on a total lack of global information.

For example - from talking with a number of European graduate students, I
discovered that a high grade school in England or Germany, followed by a
carefully selected institution for graduate work in the US can prepare one
far better _IN CERTAIN FIELDS_ than the US, English, or German schools
could alone.  (I cannot speak for Ireland, Scotland, Wales, or much of the
rest of Europe - insufficient samples.)

When I have said this to a number of people, they became very defensive
about the schools in their country, because their experience was different.
 We have different information, and without an easy way to compare it,
things get dicey.  This leads to one or both of us sounding jingoistic,
when we are merely being reasonably patriotic, and judging from a small
sample.

Traveller is, for me, a Utopian game.  I care not what the position of the
Solomani is in the 3I, but I am very interested in what kind of economic,
educational, and political decisions the 3I has made.  As a result, the
economics tend to be Libertarian, the politics half aristocratic, and half
meritocratic, and the education much more focused on lifetime learning.
This is why the average Traveller character does not go to college
explicitly, but is expected to get EDU boosts during the course of
virtually every career.

To someone who has a strong patriotic sense, it is quite silly to make the
US anything less than a full player in the next century.  This can
translate into jingoism when said person does not realize that others in
other countries will have much the same feel.  Further, many people will
have a different assumption set, which justifies their opinions.

Another example - two of the people I know in the Navy feel that the US
would have a hell of a time in a war of aggression, because we have drawn
down the force levels tremendously.  Further, their views were matched by a
 group of people I knew who were involved in exercises against current
Soviet equipment - they were not that worried about any single piece of
equipment, but there was just so damn much of it that they felt rather
concerned, were world politics to heat up.

On the other hand, the one SAS chap I have had the pleasure of meeting was
not at all concerned about the ability of the SAS, the Deltas, and various
other special forces organizations to annihilate virtually anything the
Soviets, or anyone else, threw at them.  Their training was so far above
anything he had ever witnessed in the opposition that it would be no
contest in his opinion.  This led to some terribly jingoistic statements,
but they were drawn from his experience with other, non elite, troops.

The rule I try to use is to keep my own views on "world power balances" to
myself, and limit it to Utopian statements.

One further comment:

>as a matter of fact america is depected as a tired ol\'has been and pitied
>by the rest of the world as exemplified by the quote in the book " Japan
>looks to america as a fallen giant . " why did every nation in the world
>recover better than the U.S. ?? 

Depends again on assumptions.  Five years ago, I was living in the worst
recession to hit Orange County in a long time.  P{people were losing homes,
jobs, and other things right and left.  The general opinion of the future
of the US was very grim, and the high tech fields got some of that
grimness.  You could not open a book without seeing how cheap foreign
competition was going to eat us alive.  Now, that feeling is less prevalent
with the end of the economic downturn, and the rise of the biggest bull
market in decades.

If we lost significant economic power for whatever reason, we could end up
like the Spanish as the sun set on their world power.  On the other hand,
if we turn current economic power into future economic power, we might be
able to be a dominant force for the next century.  Which one of those
outcomes you expect depends a lot on your own level of economic optimism.
Given that it takes about a generation for such effects to materialize
after the causes have happened, it is a field day for speculation.

With a bit of assumption fiddling, you can get different answers.  I
usually find those answers unsatisfying, but beware that using this model
will sometimes get you into discussion with people that seem totally
incomprehensible.  If this happens, question them about basic inflation,
deflation, and supply and demand, and see if they are using your model.

Watch this model when generalizing to a non static economy, where it is not
immediately obvious just how many coconuts are in circulation, which makes
it hard to know how much money should be out there as well.  The target of
"as much money as the economy needs to accomplish its goals" seems a good
one to me, but I am a monetarist.

Depends on the philosophy of the central bank.  Some have believed that all
you need to do to have more prosperity is print more money.  this, in
theory, causes inflation, which wipes out loans, but makes it easier for
the new group of people earning salaries normed to the new worth of money
to buy the goods and services they need, at the cost of taking the services
away from people who earned at the older worth of money.

>interest, drives inflation.

Actually, interest is not evil, imho, just interest rates out of whack with
the actual amount of goods/services out there.  Interest needs to be paid,
so that money can be used.  For example, if the economy is growing at 3% a
year, this usually means that anyone with the money can invest in "the
economy", and get back 3% more on average as a result of the investment.

If you follow the monetarist beliefs, then if the economy is growing at 3%
a year, then a given dollar invested in generic business should produce 3$
of economic growth, paid for with the $3 of new money you printed.

>In a perfect world were coconuts are commodities and money is just a
>medium of exchange, interest would be noncentsical (sp?) <BG>

Not at all - invest your money in coconut hunters, and expect that 100$
would pay enough coconut hunters to find three new nuts in a year.  To keep
your life easy, you probably would need to pay the hunters $3 for their
coconuts...

Certainly, but the rates would be low.  Low interest rates imply that one
needs to have a vast fortune at work in a lot of ways in order to produce a
comfortable living.  3% return on money implies that a noble living the
life of ten times the 10KCr average means an income of 100KCr/yr, and thus
investments of about 3.5MCr.

One point - your credit is only good at places that know you, and further,
they will usually demand that you bring in a draft from somewhere else
before they will accept your credit.  This returns us to the days when a
traveller carried a letter of introduction and a letter of credit from a
major banking family.  When they hit the new region, their new banker would
give them credit, based on the letter of introduction and the people they
knew, which meant that if they skipped, there would be either a minor
banker or a major banking family after them.  Since the minor banker will
only accept credit if they feel safe, it is usually the major banking
families that get screwed in the event of a forged letter of credit, and
thus they tend to have a lot of nasty friends to go get the money back.

	The XBoat has the advantage of one human, and a small

Let me make one point a bit stronger here ->

3G3 was Greg Porter\'s.  It was out long before FF&S2.  A wise IG would have
contracted to own that system when they asked Greg to write EA, OR they
would have contracted with him to work on FF&S2 with various others before
contracting to write EA.

IG of a year ago was not wise enough to do that.  IG of a year ago was
essentially fired lock, stock, and barrel.

Now, IG of today has a problem.  Greg\'s rules are not compatible with
anything else, save the 3g3 system they came from, and IG is not allowed to
publish his system.  They need a system of some kind.

Further, there exists a large body of work from TNE that is also invalid
under 3g3.

The decision, which took a bit long to happen, was that they finally hired
someone to do FF&S2, and blessed it as the complete and actual system.
Now, they need only find some way to fix all of the copies of EA and SSC to
use the new information in FF&S2.

If you are dumb enough to hire people to write equipment books without
being very clear about what system they should use, and that you get the
right to publish their system, you get what you deserve.  And they did -
the people who made this bonehead decision got fired.  Unfortunately, they
did not get fired before they ended up printing no less than three
supplements incompatible with the old FF&S, from which the new derived.

Read the archives from the period.  Greg Porter was originally going to be
the equipment guru.  He decided to use 3g3 for all of his designs, and, it
was expected, he would also put together sequences for those things that
his system did not deal well with eventually.  It was expected by many,
including me, that there would be a re-issue of FF&S, as well as an
official release of QSDS and SSDS that were compatible with it, and vehicle
and equipment books that matched, as various things were rationalized
between the various systems.

Turned out that either IG was not willing to pay him enough, or he was not
willing to do all of the pieces of FF&S to make a consistent set of rules.
He did contribute a vehicle design system, and a number of weapons designed
using his won rules.  Since IG did not get the rights to the underlying
rules he used in 3g3, they could not exactly publish them as part of FF&S,
thus the official design sequences ended up being a bit different.

One argument for making FF&S closer to old TNE stats than Greg\'s stats was
that this way, the results will be similar to what the old supplements from
TNE and MT had, thus there was less of a break with the past.  Had IG used
a modified 3g3, this would not have been obviously the case.

Further, because of IG\'s rather confused stand on how to design rules, they
did not push the underlying system development hard enough until _after_ a
whole bunch of supplements were released with wildly different stuff in
them.  I do think this is a yammer head system, but there is not much that
can be done, as the IG management responsible for starting this debacle was
fired long ago,and now we are trying to sort out the debris.

It is my hope that a complete VDS, various vehicles from FF&S2, and
starship design systems like QSDS and SSDS will all be someday rationalized
with FF&S2.  You need to have a complicated system working for the people
who write the simple ones, else you get conflicts.

a)	The list of materials lacking references in the database...

b)	A review of the timeline, by "concerned" individuals, especially
	anyone interested in the E21/Interstellar War discussions, or the

    'body' => '     Someone posted about their group buying a Merc license, well here\'s my
fast take on how I did it ages ago:

     First off the group needs to apply for an IMPERIAL license (which for
one means they need to live by the Imperial rules of war of course).
     Secondly, the type of license they get would depend on whether they are
a contracting group (i.e. middlemen/brokers) or an actual "mercenary" group
(and what the size of the group is, squad size, platoon size, battalion
size).
      As middlemen they can get a license to acquire any weapons their
"subcontractors" might need (up to the limits of the size of the group of
course).
      As an actual fighting unit, their size dictates what grade of weapons
they can get. For instance a squad size group might be limited to weapons
equivalent to HMG\'s or less and a light recon vehicle maybe, maybe light
battledress or combat armor depending on the mission/job. A platoon could
maybe do APC\'s and squad support heavy weapons, Plasma and/or Fusion guns. A
battallion could pretty much get anything depending on the type it is,
mechanized, armored, what have you.
     The fighting groups need to show proof of experience (i.e. they need at
least 1 term of training in armed forces somewhere).

      The above of course presumes a ground fighting unit or bodyguards or
whatever. The rules would be somewhat different for a naval unit of course
(space or wet). And different again for a COACC unit.

      In your case if you wanted to pull the license, it\'s easy, the clerk
saw this group as an obvious fraud, but wanted the money, so he strung them
along by the nose and gave them a fake license (hey they never knew what a
real one looked like, right?). On top of that he taped the deal so he can
always blackmail them to keep them quiet if they come hunting for him. And of
course when they try to turn him in, he just denies he ever saw them (plus he
just got transferred elsewhere of course).

Wow, you make one statement and everybody on your back like you committed
the original sin.  It looks people have mistaken my statement, perhaps I
should of written
"Originally a hidden design tool for the 2nd edition TIMELORDS rgp",   as
it is stated in the 3G3 pg1. 
  Yes I did read it as "3G3 was designed to be the weapons system for
T4",and I dont think that T4 and 3G3 work well together because of the
potential for player abuse, due to the wide spead in DV\'s between Traveller
penetration values.  I wasn\'t getting down on Greg, I thing 3G3 is next
best thing next to sliced bread. IMHO 

And someone else put
>"And 3G3 is _not_ "Timelords" with other conversions...it has _always_ been
> a multi-system book, 

I agree it is a multi-system but only because it comes with conversions to
other systems due to its large following. 

>"it\'s just that it uses Timelords states as it\'s native units."   

I was going to say"Its like writing a program in dos and saying it\'s not
really written for dos but all languages with conversions", but I realized
this was not correct, it was more correct to say"That Time Lords was
written to suit 3G(as I don\'t have the fist edition of time Lords to state
otherwise.)

Traveller never caught fire in the RPG market after CT because It stuck to
its guns as a hard-science, realistic (compared to most systems) RPG and
didn\'t opt for the string of fads that swept through the RPG market - like
cyberpunk, horror etc.. ...and the biggest fad of all - trading card
games. 
	Even the \'generic\' GURPS adapts to the fads to survive... when was
the last time a fantasy GURPS book came out? No its robots, mecha, a bit
of horror and cyberpunk thrown in etc.. etc.. right now. 

	Traveller also has the habit of scaring non-technically minded
folk away, each addition adding something new to play with. All my pals
see the pages of tables and freak out, while I insist that most of the
tables are for designing things and for my frustration only :). Of course
they\'ll still toss GURPS out the window in favour of MT or TNE (the two
systems I own) because they realise that a high-tech game system looks
even more high-tech with some complex rules (because complex rules are
- -supposed to be- more accurate). It also means a more balanced game
because they take a little longer to figure out how to screw the system.
	Of course if you resent complex, accurate, stable high-tech game
systems just buy Rifts instead (which sells in bucketloads mind you) :P

I used QSDS1.5 and gave the ships a 25% discount.

He dosen\'t. The 6.25% the bank gets include repayment of the loan. After
40 years the owner owns the ship (which will by then be worth 25% of its
original price, according to a TD or MTJ Q&A). I\'ve been informed that
it works out at a rate of return very close to 3% (I don\'t know how to
calculate such things, so I haven\'t checked it myself).

It can be argued either way. That\'s what I did in the first version and 
that was when I was told that the bank only gets about 3% interest.

The Rancke Jump Torpedo (tm applied for) requires a brand of jump
capacitor that isn\'t invented until around 1080 (the same capacitor that
allows drop tanks). Given the massive investment in X-boats and the
associated vested interests then replacing them with jump torpedoes
might be delayed by political factors. However, if you postulate a
slight chance of misjumping (say, occasional jump field fluctuations
that can easily be corrected by an onboard engineer, but proves fatal
to a jump torpedo), something like 1 chance in 36, then the losses will
prevent an X-torp network (35 in 36 are good odds if you are sending off
an emergency message, but the losses if they were employed on a regular
basis would make the network more expensive than a X-boat network).

Employing a Rancke Jump Torpedo entails putting it outside the ship,
unfolding the jump grid, generating a jump solution, and feeding it to
the torpedo. Doing that while you were in battle could be tricky. Worse,
the parent ship has to expend enough of its own fuel to power the jump.
A scout captain might be reluctant to do that.

Not so much late any TL, but late historically. Which would be completely in 
accord with canon (So far. I\'m waiting for the day some M:0 author or ship 
designer decides to use a drop tank. That _will_ be a canon breaker (Did
FF&S2 say anything about drop tanks, btw?)).

The three way civil war is the real killer. With that you can justify any
outcome, from a complete recovery (well, you bounced back pretty well from
the First Civil War, right?) down to the complete disappearance of the US 
as a political entity. Making the US a second rate power is just about the 
middle of the range.

Unfortunately, common sense invalidates that little trick anyway. A jump-6
courier is expensive, but only compared to ordinary folks. A number of
Imperial organisations and a number of private organisations (the 14
Megacorporations for a start) can afford to maintain a few couriers out
of petty cash. Even mere sectorwide companies and the local rulers of
high-population planets can afford them. And getting fast and accurate
information from the center of the Imperium is sufficiently valuable
that almost all of them would have such couriers on standby. Thus while
even Megacorporations may be content with relying on the X-boat Network
for regional communication, any monumental news from Capital would go out
to all these organisations by jump-6. Thus the news of Strephon\'s death
would be recieved at about the same time by the Spinward Marches heads 
of the Army, Navy, Marines, Scouts, and Civil Service, the regional
managers of all 14 Megacorporations, the General Manager of Al Morai and
I don\'t know how many other sector-wide companies, Duchess Delphine, the
Dukes of Glisten and Rhylanor, and propably several other dukes, in
addition to Norris.

Now, each of them would recieve the news in a secret, coded message, of
course, but how many of you think that all these people would be able to
keep something like that a secret? How many of you think that all of
them would even want to?

And then there\'s one kind of organisation with the money to pay for
couriers that I haven\'t mentioned above: The Traveller News Service and
any rival sector-wide information services there may be...

No you don\'t. If we assume jump torpedoes of the kind I\'ve suggested
(essentially a jump drive with an unfolding jump grid) then the type
of jump capacitor used before ca. 1080 wouldn\'t allow jump torpedoes
(though you mustn\'t ask me just what the difference is between pre-1080
jump capacitors IS; I\'ve never been able to come up with a good answer). 

>the jump torpedos are disassembled and the project scrapped.

Jump torpedoes may be useful enough, but if the earliest prototypes aren\'t
developed until around 1105, then they may not be ready for deployment to
the whole navy before the Rebellion breaks out. Remember, a jump-6 torpedo 
would take up a minimum of more than 7 T and would require a jump-6 ship to 
send it off.

Unless they have a small chance of misjumping each time it is used.

You kiss a MCr30+ torpedo goodbye. Acceptable if losses are almost non-
existent, otherwise not.

Let\'s quote the Rebellion Sourcebook, shall we?

<quote>

The standard xboat routes are travelled at jump-4 -- four parsecs per week.
A message from Capital will reach Vland in 19 weeks; it will reach the
Spinward Marches in 51 weeks.

Speeds greater than jump-4 are available, but they are increasingly more
expensive at jump-5 and jump-6 (speeds greater than jump-6 are
theoretically impossible). The cost of a jump-6 xboat network is high
enough to make a universal jump-6 xboat network inefficient. But there is
another reason. Because knowledge is power, the Imperial government
realized long ago that establishing a jump-5 or jump-6 network would mean
giving up the ability to receive information early. Knowing vital facts
before they become general knowledge is essential to a well-run bureacracy.
...

Two distinct, partially duplicated, jump-6 networks are maintained by the
Imperium: the Naval Couriers, and the Imperiallines Signal TJ System.

Naval Couriers: The Imperial Navy maintains a force of jump-6 ships which
represent the best technology the Imperium can buy. Theoretically part of
the Imperial Navy\'s force structure, Fleet Couriers are carried on the
rolls as tactical couriers which relay information between squadrons of the
fleet. ...

Naval Couriers carry dispatches fo the navy and for the Imperial
bureacracy. Couriers can carry a few tons of cargo, and maybe a passenger
or two, but their primary function, like xboats, is to carry information.
...

Imperiallines Signal TJ System: Imperiallines is a tramp freighter operator
with trade stations located in many type C starports througout the
Imperium. ...

Imperiallines is owned, through a morass of untraceable interlocking
companies and holders, by the Office of Personal Transportation of the
Imperial Household. Although a profit-making enterprise in its own right,
Imperiallines is the Emperor\'s own secret courier network.

The company\'s fleet is ostensibly composed of hundreds of jump-2 type TI
Frontier Transports. Each 2000-ton ship carries about 1100 tons of cargo.
Actually, about half of the ships are a variant jump-6 type TJ. Externally
identical to the type TI, the type TJs carry less than 300 tons of cargo
and load more fuel. ...
</quote>

I don\'t think the naval couriers are xboats, and I am certain the TJs
aren\'t. So I don\'t believe there really were any jump-6 xboats, as such.

As I recall, when the term started being used several years back it
started as much as a joke as anything.  And we ALL understood what it
meant in RealLife (tm) - our use was as a shorthand for an internally
consistent background, i.e, the Third Imperium.  The fact that you
assume we are all such dolts as to not understand what canon means -
well, perhaps that is why your posts have raised so much ire.  My
observation of the TML is that it is a highly literate bunch of folks
who are attuned to subtle shades of meaning.  Often, the condescension
in your tone is so blatant that it becomes virtually impossible to see
any of the interesting points you raise.

I was tempted to offer to produce examples of continuity glitches in any
reasonably long TV series you\'d care to mention, but I suppose that it
must be possible to come up with one or two where they\'ve managed to 
avoid them. I can\'t think of any off-hand, but then, we don\'t get them
all here in Denmark.

It is certainly something that would help a lot, and I remember that
something just like that was proposed a few weeks ago. Still, you ignored
my point: The fact that continuity control is less than perfect in
connection with the Traveller universe is no reason to give up altogether.
Quite the contary, as I said.

The fact that previous authors have introduced continuity glitches is not,
IMO, a reason to consider such glitches anything but something to be
avoided.

I totally fail to see any relevance to that. Any Traveller fan with access
to the CT material will be able to find out the canonical truth. 
Santanocheev was an incompetent. A future adventure module based on the 
publication of the biography: "Santanocheev  --  Hero of the 5th Frontier
War" would not conflict with this previously published material (the
canonical truth about the biography would just be that it was wrong), but 
an  adventure module based on the factual exploits of Santanocheev, hero of 
the 5th Frontier War, would be.

From what canonical publication did you get that interesting bit of

been a mystery.

So what? I\'ve never said that canon hasen\'t changed or even that there are
bits that should be changed. I just say that it should be changed as little
as possible and only if it actually corrects a genuine inconsistency.

Essentially it was a jump drive with a collapsible jump grid framework that 
could be extended to cover 100 T. It was energized by the parent ship and
then pushed away from it in the same grace period between the capacitors
are charged and has to be discharged that is used in connection with drop 
tanks. (Presumably that means that jump torpedoes can\'t be built until
the brand of capacitors that allow drop tanks are invented around 1080).

Look, if someone some day publishes a canonical adventure set on Tobia in 
1122 complete with arrogant _ihatei_ masters swaggering along the Tobian
streets and brave resistance fighters struggling to throw off the Aslan
yoke, then I won\'t be able to use it, because in my opinion the Aslan
_ihatei_ would never be able to conquer Tobia in a month of Sundays.
Therefor I want IG to changes those parts of canon that dosen\'t make
sense. OTOH, if I\'ve run an adventure for my players based on the 
revenge Santanocheev tried to take over Norris in 1116 and then IG
publishes an adventure that reveals that Santanocheev never existed, then
I won\'t be able to use that, irregardless of its other merits. Therefor I 
want them to refrain from changing canon unless they have a damn good
reason. No matter how good the \'No Santanocheev\' scenario is, it dosen\'t
matter, because I can\'t _use_ the damn thing. Even if the story is much
more plausible and hangs together much better and makes for a whale of
an adventure I CAN\'T USE THE DAMN THING. So changing canon merely to make
a more plausible story is a Bad Thing. Changing canon to eliminate
impossibilities is a Good Thing.

See my reply in a previous posting to this exact same point (Oh, OK, I\'ll
save you the trouble: If _Gateway_ breaks canon then it it Bad, but I\'m
arguing about whether the PoD makes sense, not whether _Gateway_ makes
sense.)

If you want to argue about _Gateway_, then argue with someone else. If you
want to argue about the Plague of Duskir then leave _Gateway_ out of it.

You could put it that way. What I like to believe is that it suits my
purpose to agree with them when they make reasonable changes and to
disagree with them when they make unreasonable choices. In which case
the argument is back to whether the Plague of Duskir makes sense or not.

>Fine, that\'s *exactly* what I am doing -- it\'s just that *my* way of 
>looking at these things doesn\'t agree with yours (or "canon"), but 
>*yours* doesn\'t necessarily do so either!

My way of looking at things most certainly dosen\'t agree with canon in all
matters, nor have I ever claimed it did. What I want from a Traveller
fact is 1) that it makes sense and 2) dosen\'t disagree with previously
published material UNLESS the PPM didn\'t make sense. Which means that 
ideally it dosen\'t have anything to do with preferrences but with
objective criteria; ie. \'Does it make sense?\' and \'Does it contradict
PPM and, if it does, did the PPM make sense?\'

Of course, things aren\'t that cut and dried, becuse sometimes whether
something makes sense depends on preferrences, and when that happens the
best one can hope to get out of a discussion is an agreement to
disagree  --  which is fine by me. If you say that you don\'t believe
in the PoD because you prefer to believe that at TL 12 medicine will
be able to cure everything quickly and cheaply, then that\'s perfectly
OK by me. But if you say that you don\'t like it because it is obvious
that at TL 12 every disease will be curable, then I feel fully entitled
to point out to you that it is not obvious to me. And if you back your
opinion with other facts that I don\'t think are true facts, then I feel
free to point that out too. Fair enough?

Really? To me it is obvious that up to T4, and with the single exception 
of rules mechanics, the authors have tried their best to keep to a consistent 
background (and occasionally failed). I\'d very much like to hear examples
of deliberate changes in the background unconnected with rules changes.
I\'m sure you can come up with examples of mistakes, even inexcusable
mistakes, but deliberate changes? Roll them out.

>And, of course, *nothing* about Traveller has been changed since the

Of course not.

Of course. I accept necessary changes that makes sense and deplore
unnecessary changes whether they make sense or not. I also deplore failure
to make necessary changes. 

>Like I said, fine, I have no problem with it -- but allow *me* to do the 
>same! Fair\'s fair!

I wasn\'t aware that I had any way of preventing you, much less of trying
to do so. All I\'m doing is to discuss whether the PoD is one of those
changes that needs to be made or not. Fair enough?
 
>So it boils down to "I accept some things that suit me and reject others." 
>Like I said, I can live with it.

Let\'s agree that we both have the right to accept what suits us and reject
what dosen\'t, OK? Good. Now, can we go on to discuss the thing I have been
discussing all along, namely whether the PoD makes sense the way it is
presented and, if not, the least disturbing adjustment necessary?

>>I hope I manage to state it clearly enough this time: _The diseases that

Yes, of course. The diseases were carried to the Vilani worlds by Terrans.
You don\'t carry a disease from one world to another if you actually suffer 
from it. That\'s what being a carrier is all about. Think of the Terrans as 
thousands of Thyphoid Marys and you may get the idea. 

>You know exactly *what* diseases constituted the PoD?

No, of course not. For one thing, they haven\'t evolved yet. For another,
they don\'t affect Terrans, so we wouldn\'t recognize then if we saw them.
For a third, it is a mistake to get too detailed about such things. It
only gives people who know something about the subject an opportunity

No, you have one less fact backing you up than I have: I have a canonical
statement of the effects of the disease. If things were the way you claim,
then that statement would be wrong. Ergo, things can\'t be the way you
claim. That\'s logic, innit?

I\'m being half serious here. IMO canon changes should be limited to where
they are unavoidable. If by assuming that things are a certain way (and
the assumptions are not themselves impossible) we can make things work out
the canonical way, then we should assume that things are that way.

(I also have the following statement taken from TD#20:) 

"...The Plague [of Duskir] was a complex infection caused by a combination of
microorganisms common to the Solomani, including yeast, staphylococci,
digestive bacteria, and veneral disease."

> 
>Assuming that this is true, then so what? Digestive bacteria, as I have

Again, if a certain assumption is necessary to explain a canonical fact,
then that assumption should be made. Digestive bacteria today are affected 
by present-day antibiotica. That is no proof that all digestive bacteria
of centuries to come will be affected by antibiotica of the future. And
if you can\'t _prove_ that they would be affected (and how in the world
would you prove that?) then you can\'t disprove that they wouldn\'t.

Actually, it dosen\'t say that it was the worst, just that it was the most
famous. That\'s a distinction that you should appreciate.

It makes good sense economically to steal if you have the strength. As for
moral sense, what of it? How much moral sense does slavery and the Spanish
Inquisition make to us? Yet they made perfectly good sense to some people
long ago.

The closest planet is four weeks away from Earth. A lot of people can die in

It\'s not a given that I\'m prepared to accept. We have no real knowledge
about Siru Zirka population distribution. In fact, my pet theory is that
by far the majority of Vilani-settled planets were of medium population.

Which should suggest to you that the actual percentage of deaths is not the
most important factor in what gets remembered and what does not. You just
said that the Spanish Flu was the worst plague ever. That means that the
Black Death was not the worst ever, yet everybody I know has heard of it.

Like the Terran popular press? "Millions dead on Dingir! Plague is killing
off all Vilani! Read all about it!"

>>

And Ebola has been known to kill 100% of a village. To have the same effect
in the Danish yellow press a disease here in Denmark would have to kill at
least one person. And who, like I said, remembers the Black Death? 
 
>>You\'re entitled to your opinion, of course, but I for one believe that the

> 
>About as big a one as the Spanish Flu is. 

What was the socio-political impact of the Spanish Flu? Did it have effects
comparable to that of the Black Death? It isn\'t how many dies or how big a
percentage, it is what the historians thinks is significant.

>Which is to say, sweet damn all for practical purposes. *UNLESS* someone 
>connected with it has an axe of some sort to grind!

Or unless it catches the imagination of people. That\'s all it takes. The
Black Death was a popular plague, the Spanish Flu wasn\'t. No one today
has any axe to grind in connection with either. Yet one is remembered
and one isn\'t.
 
>>What\'s so quirky about assuming that the Vilani immune system strengths

>So we have around 99% or so resistant, as less than 1% died? 

Yes, you are right. If the Old Vilani had had weakened immune systems but
99% still survived, then their descendants ought to have weak immune
systems too. So that theory don\'t hold water. The Vilani immune systems
must be potentially as strong as the Terran ones. But that wouldn\'t help
the generation of Vilani that encountered the Terran immigrants, because
an immune system that dosen\'t get properly excersised from birth dosen\'t
develop full strength.

>Seems like, statistically speaking, the Vilani immune system was 
>essentially the same as far as effectiveness goes ... 

Potentially as strong, yes. But not developed to its full potential at the
time.

>up, eh?

You know the old saw about white lies, black lies, and statistics? Just
because 1% of all Vilani survived dosen\'t mean that a much higher
percentage didn\'t die on some worlds close to Earth while some planets
far from Earth was scarcely touvhed. There\'s even a tiny bit of support
for that view in the fact that the Plague of Duskir is part of the
Solomani history (_S&A_) while it is apparently not part of Vilani
history (_V&V_).
  
>>>You will probably have Spanish Flu equivalents (the Spanish Flu wiped out as

I haven\'t read _Gateway_, as I said, so perhaps I won\'t accept the Gateway
Plague either, but as a general science fiction concept I\'m perfectly ready 
to believe in a weird and alien bug that by a freak of nature is far more 
lethal and far more persistent than any bug that ever developed naturally
on Earth. 

>If a single person with the Flu sneezes, how many people in a room get it?

You\'re using that figure the way the Devil reads the Bible. You would get
exactly the same figure by assuming that there was only one outbreak, on
a high-population world, that killed off more than a billion Vilani before
the Terran super-science developed a vaccine which was then distributed to
every surviving Vilani in the RoM. The canonical truth lies somewhere in
between these two extremes. Some worlds were almost devastated while
others were relatively untouched. 

>The 3I reconquered Earth -- and it\'s always a good idea to demonise the 
>enemy, it makes it easier to kill. 

It\'s sometimes a very bad idea to demonize the enemy. For one thing, it makes
the enemy demonize you, which makes it easier for him to kill you. for
another, it makes him fight harder, because it reduces the attractiveness
of surrender. And finally it makes it more difficult to make friends with
him when you\'ve conquered him. And we know for a fact that the Imperium
put a lot of effort into making friends with Earth after the war. (In
fact, one of my ideas for TNE was that Earth had really resented being 
\'liberated\' by those Solomani fanatics from Home who just muscled in and
started to throw your weight about (You don\'t believe the Solomani
leaders turned over the reins of government to the Terran leaders, do
you? It\'s much more likely that they executed them as traitors...).

But it\'s not the 3I who are telling the PoD story, it\'s the Solomani (not
to mention a game author). And they are not claiming that the PoD was a
Solomani genocide plot, they are blaming it on Vilani weaknesses.

"2300 AD" or "Traveller: 2300"?  I couldn\'t find any reference to a

                        ==========================

This is a set of tables that can be used as a springboard for working out the
history of a planet. First go through your Traveller material and note down
any events that are mentioned there. The roll first for major world events
(Table A), then for important world events (Table B), then for notable world
events (Table C). This will give you a framework to start with. Note that it
is a framework, not a straight-jacket. If the tables call for the breakup of
an empire and you don\'t want the empire to break up at that time, then just 
ignore the event or roll again or substitute something you do want. And just
because you don\'t roll up something is no reason not to have it. If you want
a war or a migration or a new philosophy, go ahead and introduce it.

Note: The abbreviation 1DD means that first you roll a die, then you roll the
number of dice shown by the first die. So if you rolled a 5 with the first die
you would roll 5 dice for the final result.

Region: A region is an area about the size of a small continent with a lot of
history in common.

A: MAJOR WORLD EVENTS
=====================

Roll 2D once per century to see if something of global significance occurs.

 2      No event       
 3      New colonists arrive from offworld. 
 4      No event
 5      Major historical figure. 
 6      World war or protracted war
 7      No event
 8      New World Order
 9      No event
10      New region settled
11      Impressive engineering feat
12      Global disaster

Explanation of events:

NEW COLONISTS: 
 
Roll 1D:
 0      Ignore this event.
 1      Small ship (1DD colonists)
 2      Medium ship (1DD*10 colonists)
3-4     Large ship (1DD*100 colonists)
 5      Shipment (1DD*1000 colonists)
 6      Several shipments (1DD*10,000 colonists)

DM -1 if during The Long Night.

A small ship is most likely a misjumped free trader, scout, or military ship.
A medium ship is most likely a misjumped passenger ship or military cruiser.
A large ship could be a misjumped troop transport or a colony ship. In all
these cases the ship itself may have been incorporated in the first settle-
ment (A ship can be a very useful tool when setting up a colony). A shipment
is a bunch of colonists transported to the world and left there. They will
often be involuntary colonists. They may on occasion come from quite far away,
but mostly they will be from a highly-populated nearby world. Several 
shipments are the same as 5), but transported there over a number of trips. 
They will most likely come from a nearby high-population world and will often 
be set up as a colony of that world.

If you roll a small number of new colonists then remember that you don\'t get
more than a footnote in the history book, if that, merely for arriving. If a  
new set of colonists are mentioned then it\'s because they will eventually grow 
into a big group of people, infect the locals with Hepatitis Q causing a 
worldwide collapse of civilization, teach the secret of fire, cause a major 
religious upset, or something else of major significance.

MAJOR HISTORICAL FIGURE: 

Roll 1D:
1-2     Prophet
3-4     Philosopher 
 5      Conqueror
 6      Empire Builder

These historical figures will have had a profound effect on the world\'s
history, though in the case of prophets and philosophers not necessarily
while they were alive.

WORLD WAR: A war involving a large part of the world\'s population, though not
necessarily all of them.

PROTRACTED WAR: A war that goes on for decades with occasional brief periods  
of peace. An example would be the Hundred Year War. Roll 1DD for the number
of decades it goes on.

NEW WORLD ORDER: The balance of power shifts from one part of the world to
another.

NEW REGION SETTLED: A continent or a large isolated area of the planet becomes 
the target of a large number of settlers. Remember that an area can be settled 
more than once by different population groups.

IMPRESSIVE ENGINEERING FEAT: At this level we\'re talking about continental-
scale terraforming, canals linking seas or artificial land bridges, or
monuments visible from space. Ignore this event if population is so small 
that you can\'t think of anything on this scale that they could manage. Or
make up something that IS impressive, but only when the small size of the 
population is taken into account.


B: IMPORTANT WORLD EVENTS
=========================

Roll 3D three times per century to see if an important world event occur.

 3      Roll twice
 4      Discovery
 5      Migration
 6      No event
 7      Plague
 8      Founding of an empire
 9      No event
10      War
11      Important historical figure
12      No event
13      Breakup of an empire
14      Natural disaster
15      No event
16      Impressive engineering feat
17      Atrocity
18      Roll 3 times

Explanation of events:

DISCOVERY: Something new has been discovered (or rediscovered). Be careful
about new scientific discoveries. Keep the overall tech levels of the
Traveller universe in mind at all times and don\'t exceed them unless you 
also plan to destroy the knowledge again before it can be disseminated.

MIGRATION: A large number of people moves from one region to another. 

PLAGUE: Throw 3D-3. If result is less than or equal to current medical TL, 
then the disease is \'merely\' serious: 1D% of population in one region dies. 
Otherwise it is disastrous: 1DD% of population in one region and 1D% of 
population in each of the neighboring regions dies.

FOUNDING OF EMPIRE: A nation dominating most of a region has come into being. 
It will last for at least 1DD decades (unless a \'Breakup of E.\' is rolled).

WAR: A war involving a good part of a region and lasting 2DD months has broken
out.

HISTORICAL FIGURE:

Roll 2D:

 2      Peacemaker
 3      Artist
 4      Liberator
 5      Prophet
 6      Statesman
 7      Conqueror
 8      Empire Builder
 9      Philosopher
10      Discoverer
11      Madman
12      Ruler

A conqueror builds large empires by conquest, but they seldom last once he is
dead. An empire builder creates something a little more lasting, propably, but
not necessarily. A statesman skillfully preserves what already exists, often
against odds. A ruler is renowned for what happens to him rather than for what
he does (Being the nominal ruler of a great statesman or the patron of a great
artist, for example. Or getting his head cut off by an angry mob... that\'s 
always good for a spot in the history books).

BREAKUP OF AN EMPIRE: If you don\'t have a handy empire to break up then ignore
this event or establish one retroactively (In the latter case it was propably
a peaceful one that never did bother the rest of the world much).

NATURAL DISASTER: Tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc. The disaster 
kills a lot of people or destroys something significant (like an armada or a
wonder of the world).

IMPRESSIVE ENGINEERING FEAT: Wonder of the World stuff. Examples are canals,
bridges, dams (lakes created), dykes (land reclaimed from sea), roads through
swamps and tunnels through mountains, irrigation systems, buildings (pyramids, 
temples), and regional-scale terraforming.

ATROCITY:  Cities razed and salted; population groups killed, enslaved, or
forcibly deported; cultures suppressed; etc.

D: NOTABLE WORLD EVENTS:
========================

Throw 4D once per decade to see if a notable world event occurs:

 4      Roll twice
 5      Atrocity
 6      Impressive engineering feat
 7      Migration
 8      Liberation of a nation
 9      No event
10      Plague
11      Conquest of a nation
12      Founding of a nation/important city
13      War between two nations
14      No event
15      Notable historical figure
16      Pivotal battle
17      Nation splits
18      Natural disaster
19      No event
20      Nations join together
21      Civil war
22      Discovery
23      No event
24      Roll 3 times

ATROCITY, ENGINEERING FEAT, MIGRATION, PLAGUE, WAR, NATURAL DISASTER, and
DISCOVERY: Same as above, but on a smaller scale.

HISTORICAL FIGURE:

Throw 3D:

 3      Artist
 4      Rebel
 5      Peacemaker
 6      Artist
 7      Liberator
 8      Prophet
 9      Statesman
10      Conqueror
11      Empire builder
12      Statesman
13      Philosopher
14      Discoverer
15      Madman
16      Ruler
17      Outlaw
18      Artist


PIVOTAL BATTLE:

Roll 1D for battle result:

 1      Overwhelming victory
 2      Pyrric victory
 3      Stalemate
 4      Temporary setback
 5      Permanent setback
 6      Crushing defeat

Note that the result is what the battle is remembered for. Waterloo is
remembered as a famous defeat, even by Britishers.

NATION SPLITS: This can be either through a successful rebellion or after
pressure from other nations or a referendum.

NATIONS JOIN TOGETHER: 

Roll 1D if sovereignity is bottom-up (A sizable number of the citizens have a
say in how things are decided). Roll 2D if sovereignity is top-down (Very few
people have a say in how things are decided).

 1      Merger
 2      Alliance
 3      Request
 4      Purchase
 5      Concession
 6      Conquest
 7      Marriage
 8      Inheritance
 9      Purchase
10      Marriage
11      Inheritance
12      Bequest

Merger: The affairs of two nations have become so interlinked that legislation
to formalize a _de facto_ situation has been enacted.

Alliance: Two (or more) nations have decided to join together. 

Request: The previous sovereign requested to become part of another nation.

Purchase: Part of a nation (possibly an empty part) has been bought by
another nation.

Concession: Previous sovereign has been forced by means short of war (threats,
sanctions, etc.) to cede territory to another nation.

Conquest: A nation or part of one has been conquered by another nation.

Marriage: Two rulers have become married.

Inheritance: A ruler has inherited new territory.

Bequest: A ruler has willed his land to another nation.


CIVIL WAR: A civil war, successful or otherwise, which causes a significant 
change in the affected nation\'s influence on world affairs.

I do not like the idea that ships in jumpspace travel in straight 
lines in normal space.  It seems too like Star Trek or Star Wars.  
In Traveller, when you enter jumpspace, you exit from the 
regular universe and are unaffected by it until you re-enter.  The 
only time you should have to worry about masses in normal space are 
when you are entering and leaving jumpspace.  The problems entering 
jumpspace are well documented.  IMTU, if you try to jump too near or 
into a planet, etc., you will be precipitated out of jumpspace 
at c. 100 diameters with unpleasant consequences for your jump drives 
and crew/passengers.  It doesn\'t kill you, but it makes you feel that 
way for a while.

I put a lot of thought into why standing jumps are standard.  Unless 
there are significant risks to a running jump (we called it jumping 
\'hot\'), everyone would do it.  IMTU, it works like this: (BTW, I have 
not tried to write this down before, but will try to make it clear.)
When a ship enters jump, it is absolutely and totally divorced from 
normal space.  It cannot be affected by any event in normal space 
until it re-enters normal space.  In order to conserve energy, it 
retains its normal space velocity as potential energy.  When the ship 
re-enters normal space, the potential becomes kinetic and the velocity 
is re-established.  The key question is - velocity with relation to 
_what_? The answer is- to the local gravity well.

In Traveller, it is a fact that gravity can affect jumping ships.  I 
have taken this a step further.

When a ship enters jumpspace, its velocity _relative to the local   
gravity well_ is retained.  Once in jump, all relation to the normal 
universe is severed.  The ship \'loses its orientation\' with respect 
to real space.  When exiting jump, the ship must \'reorient\' in the 
normal universe.  If there is a local gravity well, the ship orients 
on it, retaining its velocity in relation to it. 

This interpretation has many implications.  First of all, for normal 
merchants, etc., it makes no sense to do anything other than a standing 
jump. If you retain any \'outbound\' velocity before jump, you will 
still be \'outbound\' after jump and will have to overcome that vector before 
you can approach your destination.  In addition, the standing jump is 
less difficult to accomplish.  

The second implication is that if a ship is inbound on a running 
jump, it is hostile and should be engaged immediately.  The reason 
for this is that you really have to work at it to be inbound on a 
running jump.  You have to go past the jump point, turn around and 
accelerate back before jumping.  There are very few reasons for doing 
this (and none that I can think of right now) that are not military 
and hostile.

Another interesting implication is that if there is no gravity well 
where you are jumping to or jumping from, your velocity is 
predictable but your vector is not.  This makes it very 
d/a/n/g/e/r/o/u/s/ interesting to do a running jump in these situations.

Trash the misjump table.  Go back to the old standby, 1d6 for 
direction, 1d6 for number of dice for distance.  It is much simpler 
and more random, IMO.  And, by golly, misjumps _should _ be random!

"...the Rule of Man contained the seeds of it\'s own downfall in it\'s very

under the rule of _Law_, Vilani or Terran.

With power concentrated into an easily corruptible minority, no clear
succession procedure, and the replacement of the old Vilani social order
with chaos, in retrospect it is surprising that the so-called Rule of Man
lasted as long as it did.  Without the Rule of Law, any Law, the Ramshackle

It has always seemed to me that the Empress Irene (who actually went by
the title Emperor) would make a good noble villain for a Traveller
campaign.  This would preferably not be as Empresss of the Third
Imperium, deity forbid, (although she might make a Good Emperor of the
Flag) but rather as the head of a pocket empire, or perhaps as a TNE
TED.  Anyone who would put their own sons eyes out to hold onto power
would be frighteningly ruthless to a group of players (if you are a
really twisted GM you could make Irene a noble charecters mother).

	I don\'t think there are many banks left that do this.  
International currency and investment flows are big enough and volatile 
enough that, especially for small countries, monkeying with the 
macroeconomics leads to the flight of foreign capital and a big economic 
crash.  Look what happened to Mexico a few years ago when they tried to 
prop up the peso beyond its real value.  The same thing is happening 
right now in Malaysia.
	In Trav, I get the feeling that interstellar trade and investment 
flows are not such a big deal.  This allows a lot of local variation in 
economic institutions.

	Actually, you _can_ get the money back.  There are two ways of 
doing this.  The most direct way is for the central bank to sell treasury 
bonds.  "But wait," you say "they\'re printing money, won\'t that 
_increase_ the money supply."  No, because they are selling a bond to the 
public, the public gets the bond and the treasury department gets the 
_money_ and then sits on it, taking it out of circulation.  Furthermore, 
the treasury bonds they sold were usually ones they\'d bought on the open 
market anyway, and weren\'t just printed up for the occasion.
	The other way the central bank can get its money back involves 
raising the interest rate it charges member banks that borrow from it to 
cover short term gaps.  This gets us into territory we probably don\'t 
want to bother with, suffice to say that by changing banks\' behavior, the 
central bank can affect the overall amount of money and credit available 
in the economy.
	The other thing I\'d like to point out about Michael\'s statement 
is that inflation occurs at the _top_ of the business cycle because the 
aggregate demand in the economy exceeds the aggregate supply provided by 
the economy.  As the economy grows, businesses and consumers anticipate 
this growth by investing in new capacity, or borrowing against future 
earnings to buy a car or whatnot.  When people become too optimistic 
about future growth, they are too aggressive about this anticipatory 
investment, and they start to bid up prices.  This increase in the price 
level is inflation.  This is why Wall Street always seems to freak out 
about what the rest of us consider _good_ news: low unemployment.  When 
umemployment gets too low, they fear that employers will begin stealing 
each others employees and sending wages higher.  Wage increases are okay 
as long as they are matched by productivity increases.  If they are not, 
then inflation results.

It all started with Anglo-Saxon (aka "Old English"). In it there were
*three* words. "Person, sex indefinite" = man. "Person, sex female" =
wifman. "Person, sex male" = wefman.

Since the most common use of "man" in reference to strangers or groups
of strangers, and strangers were almost always *male* (women didn\'t get
to travel much), "wefman" got adsorbed in "man". Leaving the less
commonly used "wifman" to stick around. 

And thus, in our time we have "man" filling *two* roles ("sex male" and
"sex indeterminate") while "woman" fills only one.

The *true* feminists have more important things to worry about (like
wage inequities, and unequal treatment). The ones that just want to
make a fuss about things like this "sexist usage" tend to be the
radicals and the crackpots (hint, any "feminist" who claims that only
women can be feminists, or merely acts that way, is *not* a mainstream
feminist!)

Any life support system that can\'t handle gunsmoke from a small battle
can\'t handle the smoke from a stateroom burning. And that would be a
suicidal design decision. After all, even if the furnishings were 100%
safe (which would have to include not giving off fumes when exposed to
high temperatures) you can\'t force passengers to use "safe" luggage and
clothing. 

CO2 recycles fairly easily, though high levels do cause discomfort.
What\'s mostly causing the trouble in firing ranges are sulfur and
nitrogen oxides. Luckily they are *very* soluble in water, thus likely
to be removed easily as part of the normal treatment of the air. They
also react with the chemicals used to extract CO2 (if you are doing so
chemically) so that "handles" them too.

It\'s likely to trigger the fire suppression systems, or at least trip
the ventilation sensors to run the airflow at "high". (BTW, I have yet
to see an indoor firing range that meets the standards for airflow in
places like offices, much less industrial work areas)

The analogy also breaks down because weight is so overwhelmingly
important on aircraft. Remember, they\'ve had problems with damage to

"Wasted" weight is one thing. But Traveller spacecraft are more likelt
to be built like *ships*. For one thing, like ships, and unlike
airplanes, if there\'s a problem you generally have some time to do
something about it. Except on landing and takeoff you *can\'t* "crash". 

Starships *won\'t* be as fragile as aircraft. Given the power of a
typical drive, it\'s *worth* the extra money to run things in conduits
and to use thicker wall and floor material. Aircraft tend to get metal
fatigue in as little as 10 years. Starships are (according to the
books) still fine after *40* years. That *requires* that they be built
more along the lines of a seagoing vessel than an aircraft.

According to the Referee\'s Manual, it was someone named John Harshman
(Loren played New America, Germany, and Indonesia).

On a related T:2300 question, is there much difference between T:2300
and 2300 AD besides the title?  This might have something to do with
the fact that in my copy of T:2300, the only text regarding WW3 was:

  "At the end of the century, the tensions broke and the world was
finally engulfed in the long-anticipated World War III.  It settled
nothing...
  "The devastation of World War III was global in scope, and did not
end with the fall of the last bomb."

That\'s it.  There is very little else related to WW3 and whether there

The background history for 2300AD was developed over the course of
1985-1986 using a grand social-political-economic-military-diplomatic
simulation known as The Game. The future course of history depended
not on just one person\'s ideas of what the future would be like, but
on the interaction of many people\'s ideas - the ones that survived
were the ones who understood the conflict and diplomacy of The Game.
Beginning with the conduct of World War III, players manipulated their
nations on 5- or 10-year turns to bring them into the future of the
year 2300. Players in The Game were:


John Astell (Mexico, Romania, and India)

Rich Banner (Russia, Zimbabwe, and Canada)

Kevin Brown (Cuba, the Ukraine, and Australia)

Timothy Brown (United Kingdom, Algeria and Manchuria)

Larry Butz (Venezuela, Italy, Iran, and Angola)

John Harshman (France, Argentina, and Israel)

David MacDonald (Milgov of U.S., Poland, and Canton)

Marc W. Miller (Azania, Japan, Bolivia, and Egypt)

Matt Renner (Civgov of U.S., Sweden, and Nigeria)

Wayne Roth (Brazil, Spain, and Turkey)

Loren Wiseman (New America, Germany, and Indonesia)

Frank Chadwick (referee and kibbitzing player)

	Sounds pretty much like the .50 BMG sniper I got to play with 
yesterday. Didn\'t get to fire it, unfortunately. The rifle was about 
1.4 meters long overall, with about 90cm barrel (and a 5cm recoil 
compensator), and weighted about 20 kg. It too was a single-shot 
weapon. However, using ball ammunition the rifle is accurate out to 
1600 meters, DS increases this up to 2 km.

	I also saw a photo of that rifle fired in the dark. A pretty
impressive sight, the muzzle flash was a fireball around 5\'
across... I may get to try this one out later, will post the results
(assuming I don\'t get my shoulder dislocated or anything).

Am alternate universe? What on earth do you call TNE? Historically there was
continuity, but *technologically* the replacement of Thruster Plates with HePlar
*completely* stuffed every previous product. *EVERY* previous product. To a
greater or lesser degree. Of course, *I* would argue that TNE did more than
damage Traveller a little.

This seems to be a case of "if *I* like it, its \'healthy revision\' if I *don\'t*
like it, its \'damage\'."

>editions.  How many has AD&D had?  And "it\'s still alive"...  I don\'t 

Yep, but even AD&D is basically the same as OD&D ... even the magic system is
more or less the same. TNE\'s replacement of Thruster Plates was like AD&D
announcing that they were limiting Fighters to firing a number of arrows per day
equal to their Level -1 in order to reduce the lethality of Bows vs. Mages.

Sorry, I have bad news for you. Depending on what you mean, there will certainly
be complaints. All those people who hated the TNE background (like me) will
object to the waste of time and effort involved in reprinting that; all the TNE
lovers and MTrav haters (and they exist) will similarly object, but in reverse.

If you mean as far as *game systems*, I would object to anything like the MTrav
game system being reprinted, preferring the TNE game system -- but lots of
people love the MTrav system, and would object if the TNE system was reprinted.

No, I think Steve is wise in heading off all this and cutting off both the
TNE\'ers and the MTravers at the knees by doing a Dallas.

>of respect for SJG\'s ability to produce (I may even try a supplement for

So, by all means see if they will take TNE related background stuff -- *I* won\'t
buy it, but a *lot* of people on this list would!

    'body' => 'NOTE:  WHAT FOLLOWS IS PURE SPECULATION ON MY PART, AND IS NOT BASED ON ANY
KNOWN FACT.

        Discussion about GURPS Traveller has included comments about how it
is bad for them to be doing an "alternate timeline" because this may damage
Traveller. Along the way, it was stated that TNE was itself an "alternate"
timeline, and that it damaged Traveller.
        Well, I disagree. Game retailers I talked to (about 7 all told,
admittedly not a representative sample) said that their problems with
Traveller began with MegaTraveller, which at the time was high-priced ($30
for a boxed set was a little high for 1986) and errata-laden; five printings
before it was completely debugged. MT stuff simply did not sell for them,
and this served to taint their opinions of the Traveller line as a whole;
this carried over to TNE.
 As for an alternate timeline, TNE is not. I\'m sure that when and if IG or a
licensee gets around to publishing materials related to that mileau,
thruster plates will be retconned back in, perhaps with a handwaving
explanation of why the RC can\'t make them. But that does not invalidate the
storyline. 
        I think GURPS Traveller is being done the way it is for a couple of
reasons; first, I know that Marc is not overly fond of some of the things
that were done with Traveller during his period of non-involvement. This is
a chance to have a timeline where these things did not occur. (By the way,
just because Strephon doesn\'t get killed doesn\'t mean there\'s no Civil War;
the pressures are still there, and a war could still break out. it wouldn\'t
be the Rebellion per se, but could be just as interesting.) Secondly, I have
many times read that Steve Jackson is very fond of classic Traveller. IF
there is going to be a GURPS Traveller, it would make sense to me that it is
either going to be set in the "classic" era (which might be tough because a
lot of that has already been done and using that material might be legally
difficult ) or it would be what it is going to be; a continuation of classic
Traveller PAST 1116 into unwritten and therefore original territory.
        I don\'t think "alternate timelines" are going to hurt Traveller.
There will be crossover in the sales, but fundamentally, those who prefer
the original Traveller universe (and yes, I do prefer it) will continue to
play there. Those with a strong nostalgia bent will like GT; there may be
those who will use the GT background but the T4 rules, and those who use GT
rules but the current universe at their favorite points along the timeline.
I think GURPS, for example, would make an excellent system for TNE gaming.
It has  many of the same elements as the TNE system, but does it better in
many respects ( i do not and have never cared for the GDW House System all
that much). For my tastes, much as I love GURPS, I intend to continue
running T4.

What kind of question is this? REMF? Methinks the Gulf War was a bit
diffferent than Vietnam. Many combat types have this nonsensical idea that
support troops are useless. Iraq probably has a better appreciation of their
supply troops now.

Remember that the last war America fought on it\'s own, we lost.  
WHAT? I mean that. WHAT? This is a gross insult to the very brave South
Koreans, Thais, and Australians that joined America in the Vietnam war.

Palace above Capitasl/Code.  Archduke Dilnor of Illelish attempted to
assasinate the Emperor, but the attempt was thwarted by the bravery of the
Aslan Terlyaruiwo ambassador and the resourcefulness of the Imperial Guard.

The plot only became known to Imperial security forces shortly before the
attempt, who acted swiftly and decisively to prevent the assasination.
Archduke Dulinor did managed to fire off several rounds at the Emperor, but
these were intercepted by the Aslan ambassador, who was mortally wounded in
the exchange.  Emperor Strephon returned fire, killing the Archduke and his
aide.

Capital has been placed under martial law.  Off-planet transportation has
been suspended temporarily.  A few minutes ago, an Imperial spokesman
confirmed the assasination attempt, and stated that further arrests have
been made.

The body of the Aslan Terlyaruiwo lies in state in the central Hall of
Nobles beneath the Moot spire.


Capital/Core (2118 A586A98-F)	133-1116

Emperor Strephon appeared briefly in public this morning, and read a short
statement:

\'An assasination attempt against our person and our family has been
thwarted by bravery and quick thinking.  Despite all preparations, the
attempt may well have been successful if not for the brave sacrifice of the
Aslan Terlyaruiwo ambassador.  The attempt may have been part of a wider
plot against the Imperium by forces loyal to the Archduke of Illelish,
Imperial authorities are investigating this possibility.\'

The Emperor went on to add that the Imperial Navy is being placed on full
alert, and that martial law on Capital would continue until the security
situation becomes clearer.  He ended his address with a brief appeal for
calm, and called on all Imperial citizens to pray for the Aslan ambassador.

A spokesman for the Emperor added that full details of the incident wouyld
be made available to the press as soon as security concerns permit.

I agree with just about everything you said. Just a minor tweak though.
Starships, especially the larger ones, can keep going for over a 
century if proper maintenance is done. I wouldn\'t expect to see
privately owned ships lasting that long, but the excellent work done
in Navy maintenance yards ensures the longevity of their ships.

THat would be a little sick.  But Byzantine history (and that of many 
other eras) provides a wealth of ideas for a good GM.  I mean, David 
Drake has made a career of translating the Byzantine Empire into 
Fantasy and SF milleus, why can\'t you?  Although my favorite is the 
General series.  Which provides some interesting ideas, too.  Imagine a 
culture where computor chips are sacred icons, the words angel and AI 
are synonymous, and people hope to be \'downloaded into the orbit of 
fulfillment\' when they die.  Cargo plane culture.

Excellent points. Now, how does one fit this into the game\'s combat rules?
Let\'s say X and Y are in a gunfight with each other in a corridor.
X fires at Y and misses, with HE ammo. How does one determine what
happens
to the shot?

It\'d be nice to have the combat system handle it. I\'m most familiar with 
the CT and MT rules and I know that they don\'t handle where that HE
bullet went. If you\'re in Engineering, the Bridge or somewhere else,
the destination of the bullet is easier to determine. However, if you\'re
sitting in a corridor somewhere, who knows what those mysterious
conduits contain?

The MT rules contain a chart for determining the effects, on a vehicle,
of being hit with weaponry. However, this chart is intended for 
hits from outside the vehicle. I guess we need a chart for internal
hits, with subcharts for location (living area, bridge, engineering,
life support and so on).

You remember partially right. XBoats were Jump-4, end of story.  However,
Imperiallines, a tramp merchant corporation was owned (through untraceable
stock holdings and dummy corps etc...) by the Palace of the Emperor.  They
had top-secret Jump-6 (TJ Class) disguised as their normal Jump-2 freighters
(TI Class).  These ships carried equipment and Imperial agents and
information around for the Imperium.

However, these were not part of the XBoat network. They weren\'t what is
termed an Express Boat, and they didn\'t follow XBoat routes.  They weren\'t
owned by the IISS (they were owned by the branch of the palace that handled
the Emperor\'s transportation), and finally, they look nothing like XBoats and
had different tonnage.

There is no ventilation (or damn near) on most ranges I\'ve been on 
(excepting open-air ones).  However, a significant percentage of a 
starship\'s mass is devoted to this.  You are thinking modern, fragile 
spacecraft.  But TL-12 spacecraft are as far beyond the Space Shuttle 
as the Lexus is above the Model T.  It\'s a mature technology which 
means it\'s pretty robust.

It\'s a TL5 9mm SMG with an integral 2.5cm grenade launcher, typically 
loaded with TL-8 DS ammo and fitted with TL-8 laser sights.  I also 
direct you to the adventures in the Vampire Fleets supplement (TNE 
Virus sourcebook) wherein the only way to complete one of the 
adventures involved getting into a shipboard firefight using 2cm LAGs.

Part of it depends.  I imagine a boarding action to be rather brief 
(who would be dumb enough to board, if the enemy ship were not in dire 
straits) and moving pretty rapidly.

OK, I\'ll do the same thing on the QE2.  Assuming I\'m not in the 
engineering compartment or on the bridge, I will just frighten the 
passengers.  That\'s a more appropriate analogy.

Boarding with a .30 cal would be counterproductive.  You need light, 
handy weaponry to fight in close quarters.  And if your opponent is 
weaing battledress, things get really complicated.  If your characters 
are firing fusion rifles inside a ship, feel free to cause gratuitous 
secondary damage.

Well, there is that.  But my thought is that if it\'s general issue to 
every troopie, it can\'t be that hard to maintain, assuming you\'ve got 
any training.

I always wanted to see a copy of this simulation too :)

However, as to your "Who played France?" question, here\'s the rundown from
the "2300AD Adventurer\'s Guide":

John Astell (Mexico, Romania, India)
Rich Banner (Russia, Zimbabwe, Canada)
Kevin Brown (Cuba, the Ukraine, Australia)
Timothy B. Brown (United Kingdom, Algeria, Manchuria)
Larry Butz (Venezuela, Italy, Iran, Angola)
John Harshman (France, Argentina, Israel)
Dr. David MacDonald (Mil. Gov. of the U.S., Poland, Canton)
Marc W. Miller (Azania, Japan, Bolivia, Egypt)
Matt Renner (Civ. Gov. of the U.S., Sweden, Nigeria)
Wayne Roth (Brazil, Spain, Turkey)
Loren Wiseman (New America, Germany, Indonesia)
Frank Chadwick (referee and kibbitzing player)

So there you have it.  Now you know that John Harshman played France :)

What happened was after the nuclear spasm of Thanksgiving 1997, the US
Congress conviened and in an exceedingly irregular session, elected a
President.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff refused to accept the legitimacy of
the new government, and held that martial law was still in effect.

Many units defected to CivGov, and low intensity fighting broke out
nation-wide.  Add in the right-wing organization New America, which was
setting up a "Christian white peoples state", and you can see where it was
going to take a long time to rebuild.

The secret ones weren\'t XBoats, they were covert freighters with J-6
drives installed.

I guess it needs to be explicitly stated that XBoats are the
"lightbulb-shaped 100 ton information couriers of the Imperium." *All*
of them were J-4.

You\'ve just contradicted yourself.

In Your Traveller Universe, if you try to jump too near to a planet, you
precipitate out at 100 diameters. Yet while in jumpspace, you are
unaffected by normal space! So how did jumpspace "know" that you should
precipitate out *before* you get close to the planet?

I think as long as the "straight line" rule is made clear, by
specifically stating that you are not actually travelling along that
straight line in normal space; that the line is only for determining
gravitational effects, then the rule is a fine one and simplifies
determination of the 100 dia. rule.

For T4, I\'d say that a Spectacular Sucess/Failure would be a good
mechanism, depending on the circumstance.. i.e., your shot goes wild and
smacks a junction box, plunging the corridor into darkness.

On this idea, one of the silly rules that was suggested for TACS was the
"Enterprise Memorial Power Routing Rule"  All consoles, no matter what
their purpose, will explode in a shower of high voltage sparks when they,
or the ship, recives the slightest damage.

Would be nice, wouldn\'t it.  I have a large stack of IG books I cannot
imagine using, because the data contained within is so far from reasonable
that I cannot adjust on the fly, and I do not have decent errata.

Again, I really hope that IG is listening, to the extent of fixing up
Starships, EA, and CSC to conform to FF&S 2.

Not always.  The bonding authorities and guild ratings exist to let
customers know what the capabilities and trustworthiness of various mercs
are, and to let the mercs know what they are getting in to if they hire
with a specific person.  The guild does this out of self interest - if
mercs are all piratical, or a piratical merc is hired by a ranking noble
who knows no better, laws could get passed that make the guild irrelevant
or illegal.

Given the spotty information, someone might have noticed that this podunk
little player ship without a marine guard has a merc license, which means
it is either undercover and dangerous, or just a bunch of yahoos who got a
license so they could buy heavy weapons.  If the latter, this could be
profitable.  If the former, it could be dangerous, so your attackers might
be well armed.

Or, they might be revolutionaries who cannot afford to pay the mercenaries,
but are just sure that the mercs will see the rightness of their cause.
Anyone see Air Force One?

Nah too complicated  (What are you, a TNE\'er?:).

If you don\'t like "referee should determine subsequent events..." then try
this on for size.

If a round fired inside or into the hatch of a space faring craft does
*not* hit its intended target then roll 2d;

DMs
Location is;
Corridor or Stateroom/General Purpose area :     No DM
Sickbay, Laboratory, Turret, Small craft bay, Cargo Bay or other special
purpose area :   +2
Computer room, Bridge, Engineering control room (if seperate from
Engineering proper) or other systemic control room :       +4
Engineering or other area with primary systems exposed :       +6

Weapon is
Shotgun loaded with pellets, any weapon with tranq or nonlethal rounds  -4
"normal" handgun (9mm auto pistol, 4mm gauss pistol)    -2
Automatic weapon 9mm or less (SMG, Assault Rifle)         -1
High Velocity Rifle (Gauss, 11mm SA rifle) or laser weapon
0
Heavy bulleted weapon (.50 cal rifle) or medium automatic wpn or
Armor Piercing round (HEAP or AP ACR round)                 +1
Grenade Launcher, Heavy Machine Gun on auto, Large (12mm-15mm) AP rounds   +2
High Energy Weapons (FGMP, PGMP), AP rocket launcher, Crew Served
anti-armor weapon (20mm autocannon, 75mm gun)  +4

Character
Made a spectacular failure when s/he missed          +2
ascertained what critical systems the target was in front of before firing   -2
Specified that s/he would attempt to avoid hitting important components   -3

Ricochets; Each entry may have a % chance to ricochet.  If a large number
of rounds are fired, do not roll, but instead choose the number of rounds
which ricochet according to the percentage.  i.e. if 5% ricochet and 20
rounds are fired, 1 round ricochets.  Ricochets should be resolved as an
average roll agains dex to avoid being hit *only* for those in thepath of
the ricochet.  Not that bullets may damage a component *then* ricochet to
do more damage elsewhere.  Energy weapons and exploding rounds do not
ricochet, but remember their danger space.

Roll      Effect
- -2    Round Ricochets automatically.
- -1    50% chance of round ricochet
0     No Effect, 30% ricochet
1     No Effect, 15% ricochet
2    No Effect, 10% ricochet
3    No Effect, 10% ricochet
4    No Effect, 5% ricochet
5    No Effect, 5% ricochet
6    No Effect, 5% ricochet
7    Minor Local enviro system damaged, but still operates, 5% ricochet
8    Minor Local enviro system damaged, but still operates, 10% ricochet
9    Minor Local enviro system damaged, inoperable, minor repairs needed;
10% ricochet
10   Local enviro system damaged, major repairs needed, system inoperable
11   System specific to this area damaged (if sickbay, medical eq damaged,
etc.), 10% ricochet
12   System specific to area seriously damaged, 5% ricochet
13   System specific to area explodes (if possible).
14   Multiple area specific systems take minor damage, 10% ricochet
15   Local minor hull breach.  Atmosphere begins to leak from area.
Airtight doos close in 1d minutes.
16   Major System (Manuver drive, life support, etc) takes minor damage,
still operable.  5% ricochet
17   Major System takes major damage, inoperable.
18   Major System destroyed or damaged beyond repair.
19   Major System caused to fail catastrophically.  Explosions or other
effects should fall short of immediately destroying the ship itself
20   Local major hull breach.  Airtight doors quickly close as the
atmosphere vents explosively.
21   Fusion Bottle or Plasma Conduit breached, room bathed in hot plasma,
ship explodes on 11+ on 2D.
For rolls over 21 increase chance of ship exploding by the number the roll
exceeds 21.  So a 22 explodes on 10+, a 13 explodes on a 9+, etc.

Consider systems to be things like control panels, communications systems,
low berths, boat bay hatch controls, ship\'s computer, medical equipment (be
specific), galley stove/oven, condiment bar, jump drive control system,
computer cable conduit, lighting fixture, temperature regulator, air
scrubber, turret actuator (what makes it go around), plumbing fixture,
septic conduit (there\'s a messy one), elevator/lift, iris valve control,
iris valve actuator, etc.

Try to be specific and apropriate to the area and direction of fire if
possible.  Deck plans are obviously important in this regard.

Hull breaches may vent atmosphere out, or Liquid Hydrogen in if near an
L-hyd tank.  Use deck plans to determine or roll d6, 1-2 = L-Hyd, 4-6 =
vacuum.

Note; Using this system will make firing a PGMP in Engineering quite
dangerous!  Battle Dress will not save you from high pressure superheated
plasma, and probably will not help in an explosive decompression.

It is also remotely possible for a character with a gauss rifle to create a
minor hull breach.  If they are that unlucky perhaps they should find
another game.  Please ignore any apparently impossible occurances.

For laughs, I occassionally dig out the I.C.E. books which have fabulously
entrtaining, if somewhat silly, critical hit & fumble tables along the
lines of the above.  Space Law and Tech Law are most apropos to Traveller.

Woah, woah...  Slow down just a second.  I hope I didn\'t give the wrong
impression here.  I am very proud of America\'s forays into space, in fact, I
don\'t think we go there enough :)

Absolutely, positively correct.  I wasn\'t implying that what we did was small
cheese, I was just pointing out that what the soviets did WASN\'T small cheese
either.

Actually the specific situation I was talking about was a race between the
Sovs and the US to send a probe to Venus.  The American one didn\'t make it
but the Soviet one did.  There was also a race for a Martian probe, and the
Americans pulled that off and the Soviet probe couldn\'t.

Maybe then, in the late 60s early 70s we should have taken that as a hint and
worked together :)

I don\'t have the figures for whose space program killed more people.
However, the soviet space program relied more on people, and as a result, I
don\'t doubt the numbers were higher.  Whether the numbers were a little or
alot is another thing entirely.  I don\'t know.

I however, still am pissed off about the interview they had with a guy from
NASA on TV.  They asked the guy from NASA about the planned US manned space
station, and he said that they were working on it.  Then, the interviewer
said that Mir was up and had been up for awhile and he replied, "But Mir is
nothing more than a tin-can in space!"

And this was a guy that NASA employed.

Geez...

Excellent.  This was the system I calculated many years ago while working

I think I disagree with this.  Just think of the compression ratios you could 
achieve with bonded superdense engine blocks :-)


One of the things that bugged me about MT and FFS design sequences is that there 
is no TL advances for fission and internal combustion at higher TL.  One of the 
"feelings" I get from many of my favorite SciFi books is that there should be 
such a progession.  While fusion, or fusion+, may be the technology of choice at 
TL 13, I still believe that small fission-driven chainsaws or alcohol fuel-cell 
powered snow-mobiles have the right feel for so many settings.

My CSC design program (Win 3.1 or later) is coming along nicely, and will include 
optional "deviant" designs that allow you to use my view of high tech versions of 
internal combustion, fission (particularly minimum power plant sizes) and so on.

In CSC the "power plant + one years fuel" was strongly in favour of fission (in 
terms of Credits).  I have not repeated the sums for FFS 2, where fusions fuels 
seem to be (sensibly) cheaper than CSC. In a TL12 society (buying a CSC car) I 
see the fission / fusion debate as similar to the current diesel / petrol 
(gasoline) debate in current cars.  Diesel models cost more initially, but save 
you a lot in fuel costs over the years.  With such an economic incentive, the 
fission powerplant would continue to be developed, at the very least allowing 
smaller minimum sizes at higher TL.  All IMO of the future, of course :-).

I have no problem with interest per se, I understand it as a "service
fee" for use of money, I have a problem with the current implementation
of interest.

If I were to lend $100 and if interest were a fee, I would say "I\'m
giving you $100, and I\'d like you to pay me $5 a month until you pay it
back." You would know that if you paid me back in one year, you would
have given me $160 in total.

As it works now, another "service fee" in the form of compound interest
is tacked on the $5. I\'m "lending" you another $5 (that I may or may not
have) so that you may pay me, with yet another service fee for a service
I did not provide. Can some economist explain to me why (if?) it *has*
to be that way?

If I were paid according to the rules of compound interest, I would be a
millionaire by now. _Compound_ interest serves no purpose but to line
bankers\' pockets with money. Maybe I\'m being naive...

IMHO, it is the currency speculators and certain other cogs in the
economic wheel who have corrupted in some way, the original purpose of
money: they have changed it into a "good" in and of itself.

Admittedly, my knowledge of economics is superficial, but I fail to
understand how compounding interest fosters a healthy economy.

I don\'t see the contradiction. While in jumpspace, you are unaffected
by realspace gravitational forces (and everything else in realspace,
for that matter).

When you enter jumpspace, the conditions must be right to establish
a jump field around your ship. One of these conditions is the absence
of significant gravitational force. This requirement applies when 
you\'re in realspace.

When you exit jumpspace, there must still be an absence of 
gravitational force in order for you to enter normal space.

There is (must be) a difference between the jump field that you use
while in jumpspace (which just keeps the realspace bubble around
your ship from interacting with jumpspace) and the field you
use to enter/exit jumpspace. Why?

Assume we go with the model of jump drives posted to the TML a few 
months ago. This model holds that the jump fuel is constantly pumped out 
of the ship while in jumpspace and this fuel "pushes" the jumpspace away 
from the ship.

When entering jumpspace, simply pumping vast quantities of hydrogen
out of your ship won\'t get you anywhere. Something else is going on.
This Something Else (SE) requires the absence of gravitational 
forces of signficance.

When leaving jumpspace, one must either do the SE again or some
variant (like, reverse SE) to shift back to realspace. Thus, the
absence of gravitational forces is a condition here too.

Just my two bits.

Spectacular failure will work for MT as well. However, one still needs
a table to look up exactly what ship\'s component gets affected by
the bullet. 

Perhaps treating it as a starship combat hit would work. The MT
rules use the old High Guard table to determine hits. One of those
is the Internal Explosion table. A major mishap could use that one
and minor mishaps could use that one with half damage.

Naval Fleet Couriers were also J-6 (see Supp 9).

Depends.  While I was pointing out that there are many things that can be
damaged, they would mostly be out of the line of fire (above passageways, 
in wiring closets, etc). For aimed fire, I would be tend not to be lethal
in most cases...except in engineering or control spaces.  

For automatic fire, area effect weapons, toys that go boom when they hit,
plasma/fusion weapons,  etc... Well, that\'s why we are adored by our

around the main L-HYD feeds, and the repair bill for replacing 2 nodes of
the computer due to a grenade was...impressive.

All the ones they use in cheap political thrillers today...the Military
takes over to "Clean up things and save the country".

I haven\'t read the T2k stuff in a long time but the deal went like: US
gets into WWIII...it doesn\'t turn into a cakewalk but bogs down horribly.
The US mainland is nuked, the military declares martial law for the
duration. The war drags on, things are getting bad in the US. The tatters
of the civilian government decide to declare military rule over, so the US
can just walk away from the war in Europe that isn\'t going anywhere. Part
of this involves essentially abandoning the remnants of the US military
overseas because we just can\'t afford to get them home. 

Milgov doesn\'t like this, not even slightly, Civgov tells \'em shut up and
obey us, Milgov says no and boom they\'re off and fighting. Meanwhile the
New America, folks, declaring that neither Civgov (remnants of the old
Washington government) or the now revolting Milgov (de facto military
dicatorship)  are the legitimate government of the US. If you think this
is far fetched, you haven\'t spent _any_ time listening to what is going on
in the \'heartland\' of the US.  Both Civgov and Milgov try to supress the
\'rebels\' and we have a three way civil war. In reality, in the wrecked
country that exists in T2k, there really isn\'t much of a _war_ going on as
much as a country divided amng three factions, with some skirmishing going
on.

Never underestimate how much a "limited" nuclear exchange can wreck a
country, since that exchange will almost certainly take out major
economic, governmental and military targets.

If only Washington, New York and Chicago were hit, things would really
bite in the rest of the country for quite a while...what happens to your
lovely stock portfolio that forms the basis of your wealth when Wall
Street gets vaporized?

What happens if Washinton is nuked with everyone in town?

Answer...first, the military takes over, since they have the only
well-dispersed command structure immediately available. The various State
governors can _try_ to mobilize the Guard, but since we\'re in a big war
with the rest of the world, most of the Guard units are on active duty.

So we\'re left with state governments, the military command structure and
some bureaucrats, and Congresscritters who happened to be out of town.
Quick! who\'s 34th in succession to the Presidency?

Depending on the political climate, a number of states might well take
this as an ideal time to redefine the relationship between the central
government and themselves. This is,in fact, the probable origin of the New
America faction.

Also, the invasion of the Southwest by Mexico is not as far fetched as one
might think...Most of New Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California _were_
parts of Mexico that the US took by force of arms or force of economy. A
chance to sieze these areas back, along with the economic assets (imagine
Mexico\'s economy if they suddenly acquired much of Motorola\'s and Intel\'s
fab capacity to name only a few of the goodies)

Thankfully!  It is a great way to destabilize an economy.  On the other
hand, i have heard this used as a means of social change - if money is
worth a lot less than goods, which can happen if there is high inflation,
then people are encouraged to save little, and buy lots of durable goods.
If, on the other hand, you have a relatively stable currency, then money
tends to pool a lot more.  High inflation discourages borrowing, which
means that those with the means of production will try very hard to keep it
from spending any real amount of time as actual money, and instead will try
to use the means of production directly to make more goodies.

For example, if you are extremely wealthy, then you own means of producing
wealth.  To the extent that you own factories and other means of production
that move in lockstep, how many dollars something costs is not nearly as
important as that the dollars you pay and the dollars you get be near the
same value.  When you need to sell something, or you need more money for a
factory, you have a problem, because the loan is written in todays dollars,
while the money paying it off is in tomorrows.

I have a different approach than many - I have ruled that high tech goods
require a certain population to be contributing.  I feel that it takes
about a million people to support a functioning TL7 economy, about 10
million to support a TL9 economy, a hundred million for TL11, a billion for
TL13, and 10 billion people supporting a TL15 economy.  If your culture is
into increased automation, then these numbers can be reduced, while a "hand
built" culture will need more than these.

These people do not need to be on the same planet, and in fact, usually are
not.  As long as ~5-10% of the needed goods are coming in, they need only
local supply.  This means that off world trade is not terribly critical to
the economy as a whole, but it is very critical for the long term survival
of the economy.

This is also how I explain the long night.  The Vilani had a masterful
administrative and cultural structure in which someone weeks away could
ship goods, knowing that they would likely be needed.  This allowed them to
both keep planetary populations fairly low and to use J1 drives for most
commerce nets.

I think they would enhance the utility of this kind of system.  The letter
of introduction then becomes an elaborate coded message to others in the
know.  The delivery of keys and trusted serial numbers would be a bit
problematic, but data is awfully small - a single CD ROM today can contain
650,000 keys that are 8096 bits long, which could well be enough for quite
some weeks of billion credit transactions.  Smaller transactions, I assume
should be handled locally.

If they have a keyed encryption scheme, which would be difficult to break,
then they might well have a whole array of one time pads or dual key
encryption schemes, which could them provide near absolute proof of
validity for important documents.  I have something like this in use on all
Imperial star craft - a set of validation codes that are attached to nearly
every important communication, and which are kept updated at and by Naval
bases.

For this to work, the entity doing the credit management needs to have the
highest technology available, which I assume the Imperium has for a very
long time.  The techniques are likely known to those who want to find them
out, because someone would have defected.  Thus, you need a scheme that is
robust, even knowing the algorithm and some of the keys.

I was assuming that Doug was refering to The U.S. Civil War (not

What\'s good about the M0 background? I\'d say it\'s the \'wide open\' feeling,
the fact that three guys in a scout can make a difference, the challenge of
exploring the unknown (Yes, I loved Leviathan for that reason) TNE was in
many ways very similar to the M0 background. Trying to rebuild the Imperium
after the Long Night? Or after the Collapse? What\'s the difference? 

I have played and loved every version of Traveller. I\'m not biased. I
created a different rules system to run games with, but used the Trav
background. Later I reverted to using the printed rules. It was still
Traveller, even though I changed the combat system every week. MT was still
Traveller, TNE and M4 are still Traveller. So why do some of us spend so
much time slagging off each other\'s preferred version? Why not acknowledge
the difference in taste and get on with it. I know people who complained
that GDW was trying to sell the same game three times when TNE came out but
who then went out and bought T4!

What\'s going on?

Does anyone know why the Imperium fell? 
Strephon was assassinated? Big deal. 
The Hivers did it? Maybe.

The real, simple reason why the Imperium fell, why Rome fell, was this:

THEIR CITIZENS LET IT HAPPEN!

The good citizens of the Imperium were too busy squabbling over their
differences to see what was coming. When it happened, they were too busy
blaming one another to do anything about it.
I\'m sure there\'s an analogy there somewhere if you look for it!

My point is this: We are all Traveller fans. Why are we bickering among
ourselves about which version was good or bad? Sure, there are holes in all
of them, but the came itself is worthy. If Imperium go down, will SJG save
Traveller? Will it be what we want from Traveller anyway? Will there be a
sad succession of T5, T6 etc, gradually diluting the fandom below survival
level?

Not if we don\'t let it happen.

The table for nukes is very important, both for wargaming (because
different amounts of damage affect units at different distances from
ground zero) and for role-playing.  A role-playing example would be a
situation where the PCs are trying to figure out whether a nuke was
used, and if so, how big it was.  The reasons for the interest might be
to determine whether the Imperial rules of war were violated or what
level of threat they or their employer might be facing.

Thereafter, martial law is never lifted.  The central government starts
a purge of suspected co-conspirators.  There are show trials.  The best
and brightest of the nobility are killed or imprisoned, or choose to
flee to the marches or beyond the Imperium.  Imperial spies haunt their
every move, finding out who their contacts are and neutralizing all
threats to the Imperium, foreign and domestic, real or imagined.  IRIS
becomes a haven for authoritarian paranoid conspiracy theorists who
devote their lives to protecting the office of the Emperor -- without
regard to who holds it -- from their own fevered imaginations.  

Role-playing opportunities abound:  bodyguards for hire for nobles
seeking to escape with some wealth into a comfortable exile; bounty
hunters seeking to prove that Baron X was part of the Plot to
Assassinate Strephon, and then bring Baron X back to "justice"; Imperial
navy personnel considering mutiny against the ship\'s captain, who is a
suspect noble considering taking the ship over to the Solomani or mutiny
against the loyalist Fleet.....  I like this line of speculation.

=91An Expendable Operative=92
An Excerpt From The IISS Mission Files (Darvli Ga)
MJ Dougherty

My first job, right out of basic training, was Detached Duty with SDC. You
know; Sylean Development Corporation. They contract out to the Imperium to
open up and develop important worlds. The usual barbarian uplift: make
contact, bring in a seeder colony, build a little spaceport and raise
native sepoys to guard it. Show the locals the benefits of offworld trade
and membership of the Imperium, and by the time the Imperial border catches
up you=92ve got a world full of  enthusiastic would-be citizens.=20
	That=92s the plan, anyway. SDC gets the exclusive rights to trade for a =
few
years, and assumes responsibility for the Starport. Ultimately there=92s a
huge profit to be made, but in the beginning there=92s plenty of risk. The
corp bears that risk, not the Imperium. The advantage is obvious.
	SDC uses personnel from the Services to supplement its own people. Mainly
Scouts but the odd Marine or Army bod to advise on bloodshed and carnage as
needed. I was available so SDC took me on for a six-month contract. It
wasn=92t bad work - a full SDC danger salary, and half-pay piling up at the
Detached Duty office for when I got back. All the same I had a bad feeling
that I was along as dogsbody-general and landmine-detector second class.
You know; the expendable operative.=20
	Every mission has one.
	Darvli Ga is a nowhere world up in Lishun sector. Most of the locals have
Tech 3, steam-powered railroads and suchlike, but there=92s plenty of
lower-tech barbarians riding the plains or hiding out in the mountains. And
then there was the Cult.
	The Cult Of The Sword. Yeah, right. They were an enigma - social outcast=
s
treated with vast respect by everyone. Pony barbarians and townies as
equals, where normally they were at one another=92s throats all the bless=
ed
time.=20
	And they wouldn=92t touch guns.
	Not surprising really. I=92d not want to play around with those black po=
wer
muzzle-loaders, either. Not in a thin atmosphere with tons of spare oxyge=
n
floating around. A misfire is pretty dangerous at the best of times, but =
on
Darvli Ga it was usually fatal.
	I was with the contact team as sensors tech - supposedly sweeping for
mineral deposits to defray some of the mission costs. But not any more.
Instead I found myself summoned to meet the mission director - a Solomani
descent noble named Conrad Smit.=20
	Sir Conrad was blunt. =93Kyl, I want you to find out about the Cult for me.=94
	=93Uh, yes, sir. Of course,=94 I replied. =93How? We know next to nothing about
them. They won=92t even talk to our people unless we go through that hiring
ritual of theirs. Even if we do that, they=92ll hire out to us as bodyguards,
but they STILL won=92t talk about their religion or what they stand for.=92
	Smit smiled thinly, fixed me with his chilly gray eyes. =93I know,=94 he said
softly. =93That=92s why you=92re going to join their cult.=94
	I gaped at him.
	=93They=92re bladesmen. You fenced at college, yes?=94 Smit said patiently.
	=93Well, yes. Sir.=94
	=93Problem solved. Take your foil, go to their temple at Railhead and ask to
join the cult. You=92re the best man for the job.=94
	I never liked him. I couldn=92t resist it. =93You mean I=92m the most
expendable!=94 I snapped.
	Smit smiled placidly.
	=93That=92s right.=94

=09
So there I was, dressed in local outdoor clothing, foil on one hip, dagger
on the other, walking through the marshaling yards in the bitter gray of
morning. I mean, why are these meetings always at dawn? Why not just after
the pubs shut, or at a reasonable half-past ten in the morning? But no.
Dawn it was.
	I=92d done all right so far, just marching up to one of their cultists and
announcing, =93I want to join. What do I do?=94 Subtle, yeah?
	Well, it worked.=20
	=93The marshaling yards at dawn. I shall test you.=94 the cultist replied, and
walked away.
	Railhead was just coming to life; a frontier town serving the various
mining settlements in the Great Eastern Mountains. Railhead was a link to
what passed for civilization, last stop on the line for huge steam trains
with nearly a dozen wagons pulled unwillingly behind a straining, leaking
steam-powered boiler rupture on squealing steel wheels. It was a rough, all
but lawless place, where barbarians came to trade - and to take bribes not
to raid the mine towns, where hired swordslingers strutted about the
streets among the prostitutes and down-at-heel entertainers who made their
daily bread there.
	Conrad Smit must have really hated me. I hated Railhead.
	He was already there, waiting. His dress was the same as all the others;
leather jerkin and heavy woolen trews, high horseman=92s boots of soft
leather. Hair in long black braids. A dagger at his belt and a long sword
across his back. He stood in  the open, gazing evenly at me. I swallowed
hard and approached, sure that there was a black humor in his dark eyes at
sight of my foil.
	I stopped in front of him, looking past his weather-beaten features, to a
movement behind a nearby ore truck. Another figure, similarly clad but
holding a bow, ducked out of sight. I gritted my teeth.
	=93I am Blademaster Marli. I will test you to see if you are worthy.=94 my
opponent said flatly.
	=93Kyl Harvin,=94 I replied. =93So it=92s a sword fight?=94
	=93What did you expect? Marli answered.
	=93What if I lose the fight?=94 I asked nervously.
	He smiled slightly at that. =93I see that you are already defeated,=94 he
said. =93Let us pray.=94
	His right hand swept to the hilt at his shoulder. His long blade hissed
though the gray morning air as he jammed it upright in the packed soil of
the yard. =93Place your hands upon the hilt,=94 he said.
	I did.
	=93Close your eyes and bow your head.=94
	I did. His callused hands covered mine. There was a moment of silent
stillness.
	Then I felt his hands loosen on mine, move sharply away. I opened my eyes
as Marli slapped me backhand across the mouth, making me flinch back,
letting go of his weapon. He snatched it from the ground at my feet and
ran. I touched my bleeding lip, frowning in puzzled disbelief. Then rage
overcame me and I gave chase.
	Marli dodged and ducked among the shunting wagons, trying to lose me. I
dragged out my foil and tried to cut him off. Taking a lethal shortcut
under a moving train, I came up in front of him. I struck an en garde. He
sneered and slashed at my head. I blocked squarely, sure that the foil
would snap.
	It held, and I saw his eyes widen slightly in surprise. I snarled and
slashed at his throat, meaning to change lines and open his arm up when he
tried to parry.
	He wasn=92t playing. Instead of a parry, Marli leaned back out of reach,
then came back in as my foil hissed by his neck. He smacked me soundly in
the forehead with his pommel. I fell back, brilliant lights dancing before
my eyes and a ringing sensation in my brain. Somehow I kept my wits,
ramming the point out at where he=92d be if he came in for a killing blow.
	He wasn=92t there.=20
	Instead he stood a few feet away, laughing. Then he turned and ran lightly
away. I threw myself along the ground, slashing at his heels. He skipped
over the blow and ducked around the back of a coal bunker. I leaped up and
charged around the bunker after him, at the last second throwing myself
into a roll as I cleared the corner.
	Just as well. His heavy blade slashed out from behind the bunker, striking
the wall where my head would have been. I clumsily rolled into a crouch,
staying down.=20
	Another lethal strike hissed over my head as I jabbed the foil out at him.
My point punched into his boot, ripping through the tough leather and
drawing blood from mid-shin. He bit down on a cry of pain. I stood, stepped
in to attack, then remembered the archer I=92d seen earlier and moved sharply
sideways instead. An arrow thudded into the coal bunker beside me a second
later. My opponent took the opportunity to flee, hobbling away with amazing
speed. I zigzagged after him, expecting an arrow to punch into my tensed
back at any second.
	There was no arrow, but a second cultist came leaping out from his cover,
throwing down the bow and drawing his blade. I gauged the distance with
half an eye, made a fast attack on Marli, who blocked my thrust, standing
painfully on one foot.=20
	I threw everything I knew at him; tricky feints and sudden rushes. I could
hear footsteps behind me, knew there was only time for one more attack.=20
	But I didn=92t make that attack. Instead I whirled, took two steps and
leaped at my second assailant, feet first. I had a clear image of his
astonished expression as he tried to stop. Then we collided. I fell, he
tumbled. I scrambled up, he rolled away. Marli hobbled closer, but out of
the fight for now. I knew I had chosen right, evened the odds. Now all I
had to do was hit this scrambling target. I thrust again. His long blade
partially deflected my thrust. It speared into his side over the ribs. He
fell back to the hard-packed soil. I drew my arm back for the killing
thrust.=20
	Sharp, hot pain flooded my sword arm as Marli=92s throwing knife took me= in
the shoulder, just under the scapula. I hissed. My downed opponent=92s boot
crashed into my knee. I stumbled away, weakly turning to face Marli. Behind
him, others of the cult were closing, marching towards me with death in
their eye. There were ten or more of them. I backed up, the knife in my
back a tearing agony. I felt weak and sick, knew I could not withstand a
single attack, let alone escape. I transferred by foil to my left hand,
knowing the gesture to be pointless. Marli hobbled into range, blade
raised.
	My legs gave out. I crumpled forwards, driving my foil at his heart in a
clumsy final act of defiance. He swatted it aside with his blade and caught
me as I fell.
	=93Your training starts tomorrow.=94 Blademaster Marli whispered in my ear as
everything went black.


	I reported to Smit a few weeks later, covered from head to foot in
training bruises and still bandaged from my initiation fight.
	=93Well?=94 Smit asked.
	=93I made contact,=94 I said evenly. =93They tested me, as you can probably
tell.=94
	=93You beat one of their cultists?=94

And the authors have never *ever* gone back on anything they\'ve written? Like
Annic Nova? Jump Torpedoes? HePlar replacing Thruster Plates?

If they can do it with tech, then why assume that they can\'t (or, indeed,
haven\'t -- tho I can\'t think of any examples offhand) done it with History?
Certainly there are enough *inconsistencies* with Trav history to require
*considerable* cleaning up and many changes to accepted "canon", one way or
another. When (if) this is ever done, well, the "authors" will have to change
hsitory.

And, for that matter, they already have taken that attitude. The changes between
MTrav and CTrav were quite considerable, and there were (at the time) concerns
that the changes (historical) were going to be a problem. However, MTrav lasted
long enough so that (*despite* the stuffed game system :P ) the "historical"
background was widely accepted.

However, there is evidence to show that GDW was not entirely satisfied with the
way that "history" was being written by DGP -- an "authorial" dispute, so to
speak -- the "Sparklers" mentioned in the last one or two Digests, for example,
seem (so it has been said by those fortunate few on the list who *have* such
publications), seem to have been totally rejected by GDW.

I, personally, do not entirely accept Solomani & Aslan as "canon" either, partly
because no copies ever made it into Oz (at that late point in DGP\'s existence,
their poor distribution network was effectively defunct outside of the US,
AFAIK), and partly because it is obvious that moves were afoot to dump them.
Ergo, I place about as much faith in anything published there as I do in TNE\'s
"fantasy".

Of course, that\'s neither here nor there. But if you\'re being selective as to
what parts of Traveller canon you accept, then I suppose I can be too.

But, unless you possess all the relevant Journals, you wouldn\'t know.

This is why I find it astoundingly naive of people on this list to say things
like "so what if T4 is stuffed, simply use the MTrav or TNE stuff as a
supplement" ... er, sorry, but these items are all out of print, available only
as second hand items (or, if you\'re *really* lucky, in the bargain bin at
randomly chosen FLGS\'s), so, for the *new* T4 players, they might as well not
exist. And anything that they say that is contradicted in T4 will *not* be
regarded as "canon" by the new breed of T4 players -- who are the only hope for
the survival and growth of the game -- *UNLESS* they are republished and
confirmed in new material.

Ergo, if IG allowed "Santanocheev -- Hero of the 5th Frontier War" to be
published, then it *would* be "canon" to these new players. (Of course, allowing
something like that to be published would mightily piss off all of us who *have*
the requisite Journals *mightily* ... Santanocheev the clot? A hero? Gaaah!)

Its evidently from one of the last Digest Group Digests ... or from one of them,
anyway. I\'ve seen the photocopied page in a friend\'s collection, but he only has
the page, not the reference of where it came from. However, evidently (and I\'m
taking this from him again, he has a *far* bigger collection of obscure
Traveller stuff than I) the *alphabet* is a dead giveaway ... it also was
featured somewhere fairly obscure in the DGP MTrav era, and it\'s evidently an
obvious match.

But *I\'m* pointing out that they;ve changed canon whenever and wherever it
suited them based on their own requirements, requirements that have no
discernible connections with consistency, but a lot to do with their particular
belief system (almost always severely flawed in "real world" terms) as to how
"things *should* be". Traveller computers are a case in point -- only with Greg
Porter\'s attempts in CSC have they really been brought into the late 20th
century, all the rest were presented as humongous mainframes from the "big iron"
period -- or as what seemed to be little better than dumb terminals -- or, if we
assume that they *really* did understand the PC revolution, they left out its
implications (and the reality of it) completely from MTrav and TNE.

GDW and Traveller\'s authors have always had a particular belief system, and they
have been quite free to change some aspects of it freely, but have clung
(kicking and screaming, it seems) to others way past their "use by" dates.
Consistency has almost nothing to do with it, so it seems.

Which was essentially the design I proposed. However, regardless of whether you
or I came up with a design that seems workable to *us*, it remains a fact that
it was "canon" in Leviathan (which was set pre-1080) and that it still remains
*non-canon* today.

OK. it boils down to, as I said, you accept the changes you like and reject
those you don\'t. As I said, I have no problem with that -- as long as you accept
that this means that there are going to be a hell of a lot of different versions
of what *is* "canon" out there, because not everyone is going to agree with your
particular belief system! And, for an obvious one, while I agree with the
Santanocheev one, I disagree with the Duskir one.

And, as I said, *you* decide when the changes are "reasonable" and when they are
"unreasonable" ... just as everyone else on this list (and who has been buying
Traveller for a long time) does. In other words, your version of canon is no
more "correct" than mine, or anyone elses, its just that its the version *you*
prefer.

And it is a mistake *not* to get detailed enough, as it allows people who know
something about the subject an equally large opportunity to pick holes! It would
have been easy enough, based on historical experiences on Terra, to pick a
reason for any depopulation of the Ziru Sirka after the victory of the Terrans
- -- and it would have *included* disease, but not have been dominated by it to
the exclusion of all else. Since it would have been based on real world
historical experience, it would have been defensible on the basis of "its
happened before" and, since history isn\'t science in any acceptable sense,
there\'s really no way of refuting it.

For example, the easiest way to explain the depopulation that seems to be
desired would be something along these lines --

At the time of the Terran victory, the ZS had been barely viable for years.
Inherent Vilani conservatism had both preserved the existing, but fragile,
structure *and* had been the cause of that same fragility. As long as it had
been expanding and victorious, it was viable -- at least in the sense that its
long term problems could be papered over -- but it was already becoming too big
and complex to be expansionistic in a large enough scale to survive when it met
the Terrans.

The fight against the Terrans increasingly diverted resources from maintaining
the vital infrastructure that kept the ZS staggering along to a wasteful and
unwinnable war.

At last, it was not so much advances in Terran technology as it was complete
exhaustion of any economic surplus within the empire that led to the collapse of
the ZS. At this point, internal social stability was put under great strain, and
even Vilani conservatism was not enough to prevent great social upheaval and the
consequent breakdown and/or disruption of industry and transport, of government
and social welfare operations, and of the social fabric itself.

People began to starve as food rotted in the fields because of the collapse of
the local transport net for want of vital offworld produced spares. The collapse
of the Vilani restrictions on internal travel led to widespread population
movements and the attendant disease and social problems -- also leading to
increased death rates. In some sectors and subsectors the rule of law collapsed
either partially or wholly and the chaos resulting led to further deaths -- and
these were ongoing when the first handful of Terran representatives arrived.

The situation within the whole ZS was so precarious that it is a wonder that the
Terrans were able to stabilise it and keep it operating for several hundred
years more. In fact, the Terrans can truly be regarded as the saviours of the
ZS, as otherwise any collapse would have been sooner and much more devastating.

(This is based on what happened -- or what we now understand to have happened --
to the Roman Empire)

The PoD could be included in the above, but only as a bit player as much an
accident of almost unopposable and inevitable social problems as anything else.
And, since the numbers seem to show that the Vilani and their populace were 99%
or more immune to it *anyway*, this position of virtual irrelevance seems far
more fitting.

So, a 0.3-0.5% or less die back supports the position that the disease was
"devastating"? A 99% plus survival rate supports the claim that the Vilani
immune system couldn\'t handle Terran diseases?

I think not. Logic seems to be on my side, when you look at the numbers, eh?

And it killed 0.3-0.5% of the populace. The Spanish Flu *all by itself* was
worse than this -- and the Spanish Flu is the worst disease/plague ever recorded
(it killed 1.5% of world population in around 12 months -- the Black Death
killed 1/3rd of Europe\'s population, sure, but took over a century and repeated
outbreaks to do it.)

Which means that even if the ZS population was only 10% of what it is in M0,
then the "die back" is only 1%. Miniscule in the scheme of things.

And, gee, if we\'re talking pet theories, we\'re not talking "canon", are we? And

Err, sorry, I don\'t get the point! Most people don\'t know about the Black Death,
either. I teach High School level history (Senior and Junior) and I can assure
you that even the brightest students don\'t know about these things -- a few
might have some vague inkling of the BD existing and what it is, but no better
than that. Even Year 11 students, where we study WW1 and its causes, wouldn\'t
have a clue about the SF, as it simply isn\'t covered in what we teach, because
it is irrelevant to what we teach.

I would not assume that "everybody I know" has heard of the BD, either. Some of
my friends would, most wouldn\'t; probably all of my gaming acquantances would,
mainly because I have occasionally mentioned it, and because diseases, including
the BD, are part of the House System that we use. There is no reason why even
most educated people would know of it. The only reason I know about it is
because I have always been interested in history and read a *lot* of it -- even
when it was outside the actual course of study for my degree and diploma
courses.

Well, where does this come from? And, in any case, how do we know that it wasn\'t

So? Apart from a few scaremongering journo types ("The Hot Zone" et al) and one
reasonably stupid recent movie, why would anyone have ever heard of Ebola? It\'s
a nothing news item, really. If you live in the appropriate areas of Africa,
evem, there\'s minimal risk. I mean, who\'s ever heard of O\'nyong \'nyong fever?
And it is supposedly almost as lethal as Ebola! It just hasn\'t had the "good"
press.

I\'d actually be more scared on a new mutation of Swine Flu -- which is what
Spanish Flu was. However, even this would not be likely to be a problem in the
ZS as the long voyage times and short incubation period would prevent much
spread.

And almost no-one knows of the BD either.

Perhaps its because you\'re European and it gets better press (so to speak) in
Danish history courses (I understand, for example, it really stuffed up Norway
majorly -- don\'t have a clue about Denmark). However, the only history we teach
in Oz that is sort of compulsory (you can do Geography *instead*) is Australian
history -- and the SF doesn\'t get a mention.

I would imagine that only those worlds that were hot by the PoD and which lost a
hell of a lot more than 0.3% of their people to it would even be aware of it.
And even there it would be a minor and mostly unknown footnote to the more
important military and political events of the Nth Interstellar Wars and the
RoM.

So 99% of the populace that encountered the Terrans had a fully effective immune

So, the PoD was an accident. The PoD never occurred much elsewhere because the
Terrans realised the problem and provided the drugs and medical care necessary
to prevent it elsewhere. So a few isolated worlds were hit badly. Only on thosw
worlds would it be likely to be an issue -- and only to the now mostly Terran
inhabitants (who replaced the dead Vilani).

It still sounds more and more like a beat up. And that the Vilani who supposedly
"cured" it was a faker.

And you have already commented that the Vilani did not take prisoners and/or
killed them because they fought wars on an economic basis and saw no sense in

else, but it certainly seems to indicate that the Vilani had demonised the
enemy, eh?!

Japan in WW2. Yes, they fought harder -- mainly because they didn\'t want to
dishonour their family or country, not so much because they were terrified of
the Allies; and, of course, Australia was always able to be friendly trading
partners with Japan both before and after the war. How do most modern day Danes
feel about Germany? Does it stop them trading? Do they spit on German tourists?

it still boils down to the fact that the PoD is a beat up, no matter how you
look at it. BASED ON THE FEW FACTS WE HAVE. Now, if T4 (or, more likely, GTrav)
publishes something that is set in the period, or which unarguably and
indisputably states support for the PoD being devastating -- perhaps revising
the death rate or whatever -- then that\'s different. However, on the facts we
have the PoD was a beat up.

    'body' => 'Ok, for months I\'ve been reading the many canon debates and have tried
to stay away from them. Now I think I\'ll throw in my .02cr just this
once.

Any time a prequel is written, and that is what T4 is, it\'s almost
impossible NOT to change something. Actions that have been written can
be accounted for in the prequel and should be, but the previously
written "history" can\'t take into account what the prequel will write,
that would mean the the authors of the previously written material could
really see into the future. Unfortunately, some glitches in continuity
will have to be accepted or IG and anyone else will just have to give up
the idea of writing adventures for M:0 for fear of causing a break
somewhere down the "historical" line.

To "prove" my point... There has been much debate about the virus
episode in Gateway, (I\'ve just purchased it and am not familiar with the
details so I won\'t comment on that), and how it breaks with the Vilani
susceptibility to decease during the RoM. However no one has yet made
mention of the biggest Conon-breaker of all in TLH and Gateway! Why, if
there is a "fast transit" gate way between an area near Core and
Gushemege, even if an unstable one, wouldn\'t this have an affect at
least in CT and MT? Now I don\'t want to hear about it was an Imperial
Secret or some such! It wasn\'t "invented" yet is the answer, and if it
had been it would have had an affect in the "later" history of the 3I,
even if only as a foot note. What I am trying to say is, that unless we
are willing to tie our hands to the point of inactivity, adventures in
M:0 will always have the possibility to twist some point of Canon.

Now, this is not to say that I am in favor of throwing out the history
of the 3I after all the effort that has been put forth to write it.
Major "historical" fact SHOULD be left untouched! A Canon Bible, such as
tv series use to promote continuity would be a GREAT thing, a truly
worthy effort! and I believe it\'s been started in Don McKinney\'s
Traveller Integrated Timeline. Prospective authors should be pointed to
that tome when developing their adventures, expansions, etc...

But "Don\'t Sweat The Small Stuff!!!". If something like a the Tl14 vacc
suits show up in a scenario, instead of griping about them for 2
months... ignore them. Change them to a lower TL with some small
advancement, or skip that scenario altogether! Point out the glitch to
the author, it may well help him or her in future endeavors, but
continuous rants, months long debates, and bashing can only serve to
make it awfully hard for those writers to want to continue writing for
this game system at all! I, for one applaud the efforts of ALL the
people involved in continuing a game I love. I have my problems with it
(IG\'s continued problem with finding competent proof readers, an
inconsistent construction system, space combat ) but a least there is a
Traveller for there to be improvements to! To say it again, in closing
Thank You to all the people willing to expend the effort to continue a
game I\'ve enjoyed for 20 years, very very few hobbies have managed to
last that long, for me, and the continuing growth of the Traveller
background has had a large part in keeping that interest!

Yup.  Though the Marines advertise a Win/Win capability even today.

I assume this means me.  I *never* stated that the US and Russia did
not tangle in "Twilight: 2000"-- my reference was to "Traveller:
2300".  I am fully aware of the background of 2TK, 1st Ed.

After a brief discussion with another listee, I have discovered that
there are substantial differences between Traveller: 2300 (which is
what I own) and 2300 AD (which I do not).  I would have thought *both*
games would be canon.  It appears that I was mistaken.  This fact does
not invalidate my other points, however.

But precipitating out of jump space is a natural event in Traveller.
As a ship approaches the 100 diameter limit, it *automatically* exits
jump space (according to canon, anyway).  For this to happen, the ship
*must* be able to somehow perceive the gravity well.  It can do this
in two ways: a) the ship can peer into normal space from jump space
and "detect" the gravity well or b) elements of a gravity well exist
in jump space to interact with the ship while still it is still in
jump.

One can *choose* to exit jump space manually at a greater distance, of
course.

The secret ones weren\'t XBoats, they were covert freighters with J-6

I guess it needs to be explicitly stated that XBoats are the
"lightbulb-shaped 100 ton information couriers of the Imperium." *All*
of them were J-4.

Correct.  I\'ve got Traveller supplement #7, Traders and Gunboats, open
as I write :

On page 9, along with deckplans of the X-Boat, it states :

Jump :     4, capable of one jump-4, four jump-1, or any combination
totalling
                four parsecs.

I think as long as the "straight line" rule is made clear, by
specifically stating that you are not actually travelling along that
straight line in normal space; that the line is only for determining
gravitational effects, then the rule is a fine one and simplifies
determination of the 100 dia. rule.

Once, while I was playing Traveller, we attempted a jump 100 feet off
the launch pad, and the GM ruled that we took some of the planet\'s mass
and atmosphere with us, and that we blew up.  :)

I just can\'t concieve of the military involving itself in politics to 
that extent.  Not since the Society of Cincinnattus has a serving line 
officer (other than McClellan-and he never contemplated mutiny) 
interfered in US internal civillian politics, other than for the good 
of the Service (i.e. trying to convince McCarthy to leave them alone, 
begging Congress for money, etc.)

That I can see.  Although they seem to be a little disorganized and

REMF.  Anyone who doesn\'t get shot at.  In Desert Storm, since the 
enemy didn\'t have aircraft, the only people not in line batallions who 
got shot at were people on the wrong end of the 
something-like-four-SCUDs that actually might have hit something vital

Compound intrest is a pretty basic economic idea. If the banker, rather
than lending the money to you, had invested the money elsewhere he could
then reinvest the interest he earned. Reinvesting his earning will
compound his money.  If you want him to lend money to you you have to be
willing to give him more than he can get elsewhere.

Example:

You want to buy a car.  You want to borrow $10,000 dollars from the
bank.  You want to wait 2 years and pay it off in 1 lump sum. (Payments
as you go works similarly but are harder to understand - this is a basic
example). Suppose that instead of lending the money to you the banker
puts it into a stock fund that earns 2% per quarter and pays him
quarterly dividends.  He than reinvests those dividends into the stock
fund as follows.

Quarter		$ Principal	$ Earnings (at quarters end)
Q1		10,000		200
Q2		10,200		204
Q3		10,404		208
Q4		10,612		212
Q5		10,824		216
Q6		11,040		221
Q7		11,261		225
Q8		11,486		230
End of Loan $11,716
Earnings on 2 year loan of $10,000 = $1716
Annual Earnings 8.24%

So if you want him to loan the money to _you_ rather than investing it
elsewhere you have to pay him the compound intrest he will get
elsewhere.  Think of it this way, when he loans you the money he is not
just loosing the money he is loosing the opportunity to reinvest what he
would be earning elsewhere and therefore compounding his money for him.

It is much more likely that, in the case of a fire, the ventilation 
system would shut down the airflow in order to minimize the spread of 
the fire.  I read that this was a lesson learned on Mir, and that the 
software which controls ventilation on the space station _Freedom_ 
was modified to turn the ventilation fans _off_ ifthere is a fire.

That\'s a no-brainer.  If your Geiger counters goes \'buzzzz\' instead of

either whoopsed with a fission plant, or tossed a baby nuke around.  
But nukes are important for those of us who are wargamer-oriented (I

Erwin is correct, there is no contradiction.  Gravity only affects 
ships as they _enter_ and _leave_ jumpspace.  Jumpspace doesn\'t 
"know" ( or care ):) how close you are to a planet until you try to 
exit.  And it is not the measured distance from the planet that matters 
so much as the amount of gravitational force which is present in 
realspace as you try to re-enter it.

   Make the right person dictator-for-life of the USA, and I\'ll bet he
or she can.  Of course the transformation necessary to pull it off would
make the US something Americans wouldn\'t want to live in.  Also, as I
pointed out in an earlier lengthy post, conquest is not the same as
being able to keep the land (unless you are willing to de-populate it).

   We more or less reach the same conclusion from different routes.

>There are other ways; economic and cultural conquest, for example. 
>Those might work. But not military.

   Americans have always prefered to send out its merchants, and until
after WW II, maintained only enough of a military to keep other people
from bothering us (with a few notable exceptions).  In some ways, that\'s
still very much true even after 1945.

>One other thing. Look at Mogadishu, for example. The USA isn\'t very good at

   Kinda of a lousy example actually.  The American people were told
that Somalia was a relief mission, and pictures taken by the mass media
of the landing of American troops (taken from cameras stationed on
shore!) did nothing to change public opinion.  Quietly the American
military was directed to escalate things, the nobody got around to
preparing the American people for it.  The results were predictable.

   During the Vietnam War, the American people kept being told that
victory was "just around the corner" by the Johnson Administration and
the generals in charge.  When the Tet Offensive was launched, it became
apparent that the war was going to take much longer than the supposed
forecasts (given the Johnson Administration policy for fighting it,
**much** longer).  Public opinion turned against the war from there on
out.

   The Gulf War represents the correct way to handle things with the
American public.  American officers giving press briefings refused to be
pinned down on how long the war would take, or how many casualties were
expected.  The Iraqi capabilities were fully spelled out (not
de-emphasized as the enemy capabilities were during Vietnam), and press
briefers repeatedly emphasized that a hard fight (thus the *potential*
for high casualties) could be expected.

   Properly prepared, and provided with a reasonable cause why blood
must be shed, Americans will accept whatever casualties are necessary to
achieve victory.  The two largest conflicts in our history (the American
Civil War and WW II) should be proof enough.

   True, a motley collection from Scandanavia and Lord knows where

I\'ve been told that a crazy gunsmith in Canada made a .50 BMG *pistol*.

I\'ve *seen* ads for .30 cal and .50 cal "machingeguns". They look just
like the classic military weaopons, fire the same ammo, and are
belt-fed. But these are legal to own, because they are only semi-auto.

Sorry, but that *doesn\'t* conserve energy. And there isn\'t a "local
gravity well". At any point in the universe you are in the gravity well
of every other object in the universe.

If you mean "the gravity well of the object exerting the strongest
gravity pull on the vessel", then it is possible to play all sorts of
games just by jumping between planets in the same star system. Consider
that a velocity of X with respect to earth is a lot different than a
velocity of X with respect to Jupiter. You could play with velocities
and jump entrance/exit points and get some rather interesting velocity
effects.

You forget that velocity is a *vector*. It has a *direction* as well as
a magnitude. Your idea only accounts for the magnitude. For a
direction, you need not just the (effectively) point source of the
planet. You need another point to tie down the vector.

Remember, the vector is *not* merely away from the planet or towards
the planet. There\'s going to be a "sideways" component. And *that* is
where you need the outside reference point. Otherwise, the "sideways"
part of the vector can be pointing in any direction, and a fleet
jumping "together" would wind up with that vector pointing in random
directions.

Consider that due to the uncertainty in jump, you could come out
"ahead" of the planet, "behind" it, or "next to" it (with respect to
the planet\'s orbital motion). So it it had a velocity vector that
breaks down into X directly towards or away from the planet, and Y at
right angles to that, the Y would be pointing in different directions
depending on the length of the jump.

With the "true conservation" method, you can *try* to get such a
vector, but depending on whether you come out early, late, or "on
time" you can come out quite a ways from the planet (remember, in one
hour earth moves around 100,000 kilometers). Thus, your vector could be
pointing in a rather useless direction. :-)

There is *always* a gravity well. The question is how strong it is.

BTW, the "preciptation from jump" bit has some problems. You certainly
can\'t *aim* the ship to *deliberately* let your destination force you
out of jump. Consider how small an angle a 100 dia circle subtends at
one parsec (about .01 seconds of arc). Pointing a ship that accurately
ain\'t gonna happen. One sneeze and you are pointing elsewhere.

   Unfortunately, this scenario also fails to take into account the
tendency of Americans to unite in the face of a foreign threat.  With
Mexican troops north of the Rio Grande (I\'m still trying to figure out
how, but...), the civil war is on hold until everything else is
resolved.  CivGov, MilGov, and even New America troops would have been
sent to kick the Mexicans south.  In fact, I could easily see a scenario
where the temporary uniting against the Mexican threat would have
resulted in a new permanent government being formed.

   A "whole" America still could have ended up lagging behind the rest
of the world after 300 years (particularly if it became isolationist and
stopped interacting on a commerical basis with the rest of the world). 
Though I didn\'t get around to running a 2300 AD campaign (I do own the
game), if I had done so, it would have been a slightly variant one in
which the US still owns southern California, etc.

You co-designed "Space Opera"?  I have some of that, the main boxed set
to be precise, and I wrote a BASIC program based on the solarsystem
charts in it.  It took me a few years to figure out a way of making
those odd charts work in a program.

I\'ll attach the BASIC program, tell me what you think?

birds for neighbors and friends than I can count) wouldn\'t touch that 
sort of work if they were offered any reward I could name.

Military can\'t do that, and to think that they would step that far 
beyond their authority is. . . questionable.  Look at what doing that 
earned MacAurther.  Besides the contempt of most of the officer corps 
at the time.

The Congresscritter with the most seniority in the party with the 
majority before the war.  End of discussion.  If not any Congressmen 
left, than just about anyone who\'s been confirmed by Congress would 
qualify before an officer.  After that it gets a little hazy.

Bullshit.  I\'m willing to bet on the Texas National Guard (read:49th 
Armored Division) against any army the Mexicans could ever throw out.  
Not to mention an ARMORED CORPS that just happens to be sitting in Fort Hood.

So, as I understand it, the \'canon\' definition of jump drives has a
contradiction. It is canon that jumpspace and realspace have no
interaction. Yet you can\'t exist jumpspace without using one of the
two methods you mention.

A confusion canonical contradiction!

So, what\'s the solution? More alliteration on my part?

Yeah!  that\'s what I meant, sure.. the Civil War, I was a Colonel, no a
GENERAL... that\'s the ticket..

No offense to the fine allied units that fought along side US forces in
Vietnam, but that was a US show under US command, and we managed to tie
ourselves into knots and completely fail to achhieve the stated mission.

AFAIK, the Australian and South Korean units in Vietnam carried out their
missions with skill and elan, and the Thai units showed their usual ferocity.

The thing is that the so-called Congress has very little legitimacy.. some
Congress-critters neverhaving seen the districts they claim to represent,
gunfights between rival claiments, and a very suspect Presidential sucession.

MilGov questioned the authority of the new government, and was promptly
denounced as traitors.. that set everything off.

In the T2K backround, there was one industrialist leader who did put

felt when we finally got home from Poland to discover what was happening in
the land of the Big PX...

   Well I know of **no** TNE fan that would object *whatsoever* if
somebody did a faithful reproduction of MegaTraveller material.  Would
we buy it?  Perhaps for the background material--knowledge of what was
going on during the Rebellion can be very important to a campaign set in
the New Era.

   As for "doing a Dallas", a lot of people stopped watching that show
as a result of what they did (I personally went from an occasional
watcher to deliberately avoiding it).  Bobby stepping out of the shower
("but it was only a dream") became a national joke.

   Let Loren do what he must, let SJG and IG and Marc do as they must as
well.  I\'m not going to lecture Loren or any of the others on artistic
integrity.  They are big boys (and girls at IG and SJG I presume) and
know what that means.  What will happen next is for God/Fate/random acts
of quantum mechanics to decide.  I for one have charted my own
course--if it happens to correspond to the others, great.  If not, bon
chance.

Speaking as the guy writing perhaps the most rules-heavy combat sequence
for Traveller in it\'s history, I have to say there comes a point where the
Referee has to *run the game.*  Not everything can have a convienent table
or hard rule.

The best combat sessions I\'ve ever had, from either side of the GM\'s
screen, are the ones where we weren\'t slaves to the rules and dice, but
allowed the GM some freedom to extrapolate from our actions, and apply
results as he saw fit.

If you have a detailed deckplan, like for the Azhanti High Lightning, you
can trace a line past the target and make a good guesstimate about where
the shot will strike, and the effects of the shot.  To try and come up with
tables for every deck and area on even the smallest ships would tax the
referee to the point of distraction!

   Why should the jump capacity of the launching ship factor into the
jump capacity of the missile?  So long as the launching vessel has an
astrogator and a computer on board capable of plotting a jump and
feeding the data to the missile, there\'s not even really a need for the
launching vessel even to have a jump drive.

   To answer the question of the economic feasibility of commo jump
torps, we need the answer to the following question: How often do
problems arise as a ship prepares to exits jump space that require an
astrogator to make adjustments (to avoid becoming space debris upon
re-entering normal space)?  If this is fairly often or even sometimes,
what percentage of these occurances could be programmed into the jump
torp\'s brain (so that it could make the corrections on its own)?  I\'m
not sure if these answers exist anywhere canonially speaking.

This is such a dark theme, and a totalitarian Imperium which was never

per se, but its pretty benevolent.

IRIS was an aberration, and I think GDW tried to debunk in its best

I think there will be plenty of opportunities even if the assassination 
never occured, perhaps Dulinor gained the support of Admiral Hutara (his 
brother) and subverted the fleets in Illelish to start a 2nd Illelish 
Revolt in an attempt to "reform the Imperial governement."
   Or perhaps, no revolt will happen as the Wavefront approaches the 
Imperium and/or the "Bad Guys from the Core" hypothesis is revived.

The state of martial law was declared by the Prez shortly before he started
a new career as widely dispersed plasma.  The military was the only part of
the government that was till feeding people by 1999.

But the JCS decided that the circumstances of the seating of Congress,
along with the election of the President, were unusual, and possibly
unconstitutional.  So they refused to relinquish authority.

The Armored Corps was, in fact, sitting in Southern Iran.  The Mexican Army
was aided by the Soviet "Division Cuba" and a Red Dawn-esque collection of
Carribean All-stars.  They didn\'t get far, bogging down short of Dallas
(damn.)

Mexico\'s greater gains in the far west are easoier to explain after the
nuking of LA removed most of the reason to defend the area.. Oddly enough,
most of California\'s NG units are in the northern half of the state.

I LOVED the Dragonlance novels.  Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weise are
wonderful authors.  I\'m waiting for Margaret to do her Traveller book.

I\'m going to buy it.

Yes.  I bought the first one and couldn\'t finish it.  What a stinker!  I

When I first read the TNE background, I was turned off because of the
rules.  It wasn\'t Traveller.  It was something else, and if I wanted to
play a different sci-fi game other than Traveller, I had Battletech,
Star Wars, or plenty of others to choose from.

The biggest bugger for me was that they changed everything that I was
used to from CT and MT--the task system,the dice, the whole way the game
was played.  It just didn\'t feel like Traveller.

It is not that I am against change.  MT was a change from CT, but when I
first read it, my reaction was exactly the opposite.  I felt MT\'s
changes were very Traveller is feel and actually improved the game.

I didn\'t like the art in TNE.  It was too comic-booky.  I had grown to
love the realistic visions that I saw in CT and MT supplements.

When I actually got around to reading the rules in TNE, I was surprised
to see that I actually liked them.  If this game had a more Traveller
feel, I probably would have thought it was the best thing since sliced
bread.

I really liked the detail put into TNE.  They thought of everything.

Then, I played it--with a huge learning curve, I might add.  And, my
opinion changed again.  Although the combat and rules systems were very
detailed--the most detailed Traveller systems to date--it is so
complicated that it is almost unplayable.

You get the detail--but you also have to pay for having that much detail
in the game by all the dice throws.

Take two people firing automatic weapons at each other. 

In TNE, you roll for every round fired.

A guy has a guass rifle.  He sets it for 5 round bursts.

Oh boy, here we go.

First, you roll initiative.  Our boy gets to go.  In one fire action,
our boy can pull the trigger 5 times, letting loose 25 bullets.

That\'s 25 D20 throws!

And, we haven\'t added in modifiers yet for range, skill, and
recoil--which, of course will reduce some of those throws.

OK, then we count up how many hits we made. For each hit, we roll on the
hit location chart.  Then, we roll damage,and these points are applied
to the target\'s hit points.

THEN we check to see what, if any, effects these wounds have on the
target.

And, I haven\'t even talked yet about figuring penetration if the target
is wearing armor.  Figuring range is different for each weapon,so that\'s
a calculation that needs to be made everytime somebody fires.  Recoil
can be different WITH EACH PULL OF THE TRIGGER.

And, let\'s not even talk about if our guy gets two actions in a
round--because all of this is just one half of his turn.  He gets to
roll the whole 25 dice again, and go through all of these calculations
for his second action.

When you are all done with that, it\'s time for the next person in the
round to go.

Sheesh.  It takes you all night to do one fight--and there\'s a chance
you won\'t get through.

I think TNE was a good idea that was executed poorly.  I\'m a very
detailed oriented GM, but there is something to be said for simplicity
and fast game play.

Since I\'ve converted over to the T4 system, albeit it is much more
simple and not as realistic, me and my players are having more fun with
the game.

It\'s nice to fire an automatic weapon and just double the damage die
instead of going through all those steps above.  Sure, T4 doesn\'t even
account for recoil, but the gains you make in faster,and more fun, game
play is more than worth it.

And, who knows, I bet we find a rule sometime down the road that will
allow for recoil in T4.  It will be something simple, like a DM to the
attack throw, and that will be it.

Anyway, since you asked, that\'s what I had against TNE.  The setting
wasn\'t high on my list, but the bigger problem I had was the game\'s
playability.  

That, and the fact that the game just didn\'t feel like Traveller.  No
D6\'s.  They changed the trademark chargen for Heaven\'s sake!

	Yes, that\'s true. I should have a picture of the pistol somewhere on

anybody\'d want to shoot one...

	BTW. That\'s not the worst. A german gunsmith has built a 4-shot

	Well, unless downtown Jerusalem is not considered anything vital...
According to Gulf War IRC logs from #peace, 121 SCUD missiles hit
Jerusalem and the surroundings. The problem with SCUDs wasn\'t the 
Patriot missiles but poor pre-strike intel, they couldn\'t hit a damn

Re: your Historical Events Generator: Cool idea. I like this. I\'ll probably

I seem to recall seeing the language on the Annic Nova somewhere else as
well.  This does not prove that the builders of the ship built the ships
special solar powered jump drive.  It is entirely possible that the
human minor race which may (or may not) have built the ship used 2 spare
TL 25 jump drives the ancients had conveniently (for plot purposes) left
behind 300,00 years ago.  The language used on the ship may be only the
language of the builders of the ship, not of the builders of the
_drive_.  Note that nowhere in Annic Nova is the ships _hull_ being
described as being made of any special material, if the hull was TL 25
it would be made of special material.  We know that some minor races
copied Ancient jump drives and we know that some Ancient artifacts still
work fine.  I could easily believe that an Ancient jump drive might work
fine.  Living metal that is self regenerating due to nano technology
(insert your vision of TL 25 technology here - this is just an example)
might last just fine for 300,000 years without preventative maintenance
and be as good as new. Someone found them and built a ship around them
- -and then died of plague but I probably should not mention plague right
now :)

How do you know that when the crew returned home they were not
debreiefed and told not to tell anyone.  Suppose none of them told
anyone - or that if they did they were not believed.  The Imperium then
sent out a (top secret) ship to try & use the transit gate.  The gate
promptly blew up, destroying itself & the ship.  When the ship never
came back some dull bureaucrat/spook wrote a report on the subject. 
This report was then filed away in a room similar to the one the US
Governments "top men" put The Ark of the Covenant in at the end of
Indiana Jones.  No a working gate could not have been kept secret, but a
gate that has been broken for a thousand years and whose only reported
history is on secret documents no one has bothered to look at in the
past millenia would keep itself secret.  Even if found the file might
not be believed.  If believed the only response might be "A pity it
broke."

It can be. But it\'s also an amusement for those of use willing to throw
away a little money to see if the long odds come up. After all, it is
*very* probable that *someone* will win. But the set of possible
winners is restricted to those who buy tickets. So we toss in some
spare change (when I can afford it). If I win, great. If I don\'t, I
still had a moment\'s amusement.

Never forget that the US *had* a space station. Skylab. And between
NASA and Congress, we piddled things away on the Shuttle program until
it was too late to reboost it. If the Shuttle funding hadn\'t had games
played with it, or if NASA had been willing to propose a "just in case"
backup program that could\'ve re-boosted Skylab if the Shuttle program
wound up behind schedule (as it did) then we\'d still have a Space
Station. 

And while the backup might have been a bit hard to sell, they could
have had a secondary purpose for it. ("If, as we expect, the Shuttle is
on schedule, then we can use this to do X")

Sorry, but even in a fusion reactor the plasma is pretty thin. The hot
plasma is low density, so *it* will cool off without seriously heating
the surroundings. That\'s one of the reasons you need to use magnetic
fields, to keep the plasma from cooling off by contacting the walls of
the reactor.

And the ship *won\'t* explode if you breach the fusion bottle.

Again, the pressure of fusion plasma is low, because it\'s easier to
raise the temp than the pressure.

A Plasma weapon is producing (relatively) high density plasma, at lower
temperatures (say a hundred thousand degrees instead of a hundred
*million*).

Old rule of cryptology. No code/cipher is secure unless it can provide
protection against someone who knows the algorithm, but not the key.
This is because it is *inevitable* that the algorithm will either leak,
or worse, be guessed. 

If a key is known, that key is blown. But again, knowledge of one key
should not compromise others. If it does, the code system is a piece of
junk.

Theoretically, one time pads will *always* be secure. The only trouble
is key distribution (well, key generation is tedious, but that\'s
relatively minor).

Public key ciphers are subject to mathematical advances. Not
*computational*, because if you have faster computers, then you can use
bigger keys. But if someone comes up with a new mathematical technique
that greatly decreases the work required to carry the mathematical
operation that "secures" the cipher, then you are toast. For example, a
whole bunch of public key schemes went down the tubes a few years back
when somebody came up with a better solution to what\'s known as the
"knapsack problem". The remaining schemes are based on the difficulty
of factoring large numbers. So if a breakthrough is made in algorithms
for factoring large numbers, they go away.

But for game purposes, we can assume that factoring is inherently hard
(or that some new trick is found). So public key ciphers would be
usable, though the keys may be a small book\'s worth of digits (stored
in a tiny bit of storage). 

Given the fact of there being higher tech cultures, one time pads will
be used for military and diplomatic stuff as well as anything that you
are afraid might be trouble if someone with higher tech shows up.

But for generic business purposes, you just use the highest TL
available for the public key ciphering gear. That way, it\'s unlikely
that anybody can crack things soon. Sure, if a TL 16 race is found,
they can crack your ciphers in weeks instead of years, but they aren\'t
likely to *bother* with most commercial stuff.

So what do you do if he pays you $50 some month? Let\'s make it $55.
That\'s the $5 fee *plus* half of the money he owes you. So he can quite
reasonably ask you to reduce the fee to $2.5 per month. 

Thus the fee is based on him paying you 5% of what he owes you each
month.

Start by considering the fact that people have to *deposit* money in
order for the bank to have something to loan. And you want them to do
so for long periods. So you pay them a fixed amount per time period,
based on how much money they have deposited. 

That\'s no different than you getting paid X dollars for performing a
service for a specific period. 

Likewise, the guy the money is loaned to pays so much per amount of
money per time period. 

Given this, as soon as you deal with more than one period, you have
"compound" interest.

For the depositor, at the end of the first period, you deposit his
payment for letting you use the money to his account. So there\'s now
more money in there, so he\'ll get more interest the next period.

For the borrower, he is paying so much per dollar per period. So if he
doesn\'t pay by the end of the period, he owes the fee *and* the money.

Now getting back to your example, what if you *have* to get the $100
you loaned him back by a certain date. And he wants the payments to be
equal. Say you want it back in a year. So like you said, he has to pay
you $160. But he wants to do it in equal monthly payments. So that\'s
$13.33 per month. Which is a $8.33 payment on the principle, and $5
fee.  

But the fee no longer matches what he owes you. The first month is 5%
of the principle. The second month, he only had $91.67, but still paid
$5. That\'s 5.45%. The last month, he only owed $8.34, but paid $5
interest. That\'s 60% interest!

By the time you\'ve done this a lot, and had to deal with things like
early and late payments, you wind up with compound interest. 

And compound interest is simply being charged a fee that\'s a fixed
percentage of what you owe. If you pay *more* than the fee each month,
you reduce the amount you owe by the difference between what you paid
and the fee for that month. So it\'s possible (though difficult) to
calculate what size payment you need to make to pay off the loan in a
given number of months.

Fission has the inherent problem that reactors have to run rather close
to the edge, and this is even truer for smaller reactors. Critical mass
is a fixed quantity, and while you can cheat a little with a bomb
(imploding it to ridiculous densities), that can\'t be done with a
reactor. 

Fuel cells aren\'t internal combustion engines. There are some very
weird fuel cells that could be sold for low-tech power generation. Like
the one that consists of one or more ceramic tubes, and generates power
by passing oxygen thru the ceramic. So you spray fuel (liquid, gas, or
even powdered) thru the tubes and ignite it. Once it reaches a dull red
heat, you cut back on the air/fuel ratio and generate power from the
oxygen migrating into the tubes to burn with the fuel. It\'s even
possible to make things like this that can generate power from a
campfire. Not *much* power, but enough for a few things.

BTW, I still think there\'s a place for some fission powered ships (like
the Rolling Stone in Heinlein\'s "The Rolling Stones") that have had a
jump drive added later. The exhaust is *not* all that radioactive. So
it\'s safe enough to land and take off from a normal downport, though
it\'d be much cheaper to use the highport. 

Sure, they\'ll be less profitable than fusion powered ships. But the
m-drive needs *very* little maintenance. You just replace the fuel
pellets every 10 years or so, and keep the fuel pumps working and check
the condition of the fuel passages in the reactor and the jet during
annual maintenance. The j-drive takes the normal amount of maintenance.

The ship would probably not boost all the way to the jump point. Just
make a burn to get on course to it, coast for some hours, then jump.
As long as you like free fall, you could likely make a living.

As I\'ve mentioned before, if I had the time and the required reference
material, I\'d do up an article giving stats for various "obsolete"
vessels that folks had upgraded with bits of newer (but still obsolete)
tech. Things like an old Space Shuttle fitted with a small fusion unit,
and being used to haul stuff around in-system. And other "junkyard
salvage" goodies that might be recognizable.

No.  All it takes is one or two accidents with a fission-driven device 
to convince a culture which has other options available that fission is 
a BAD IDEA[tm].  Hell, look at the impact Chernobyle caused, and we 
_don\'t_ yet have an alternative that\'s not eviromentally unpleasant and 
partially dependant on nations run by unstable lunatics for the fuel.

Shades of the Soviet almost-coup.  Geez, even Cromwell managed a coup

Hmph!  Third-rate barbarian!  Didja see TLC\'s series on Byzantine art?  
The Byzantines made something for him that\'s absolutely trippy.  Showed 
the Court of Heaven, and they put the Doge in there (for a small 
price).  But when the sent it to Venice, even the Venetians realized he 
was being denigrated when the Doge didn\'t have a halo, so they cut out 
the head and replaced it with one with a halo.  But they missed the

And accuracy.  When the Iraqis were aiming at *Saudi Arabia* they

SCUDs were absolutely worthless as a military weapon.  Their only value

and thus achieved 100% success.  After all, Israel didn\'t nuke western 
Iraq flat, so they can be said to have fulfilled their mission.

NASA did have the capacity to reboost Skylab (there was at least one gantry,
one Saturn V and a couple of Saturn I\'s left over from the Apollo program).
Besides Skylab was never a "permanently manned" space station. This is not
to belittle the achievements of Skylab (the first space station is a fairly
major milestone) but if it were still up there, it would probably be in
even worse shape the Mir. Remember Mir has been up there, manned for some
considerable number of years now (at least 10 I think), the first permanently
manned space station is also a fairly major milestone.

Look at it the other way around. Say you have money in the bank and the
banker pays YOU interest. One way he could do it is to pay you once a year...
Dec 31. in one lump. The way they do it is credit interest every week or day
or whenever, and then they pay interest on the interest. Wouldn\'t you feel
ripped off if they credited interest to your account and then didn\'t pay
interest on that portion?

The REAL reason the banker handles loans as you describe is because theyare
on time payments. He faces too much risk if you borrow $30,000 for that new
Lexus for four years with terms that say you\'ll pay it all at the end of four
years. The risk is that you won\'t pay and he\'ll have lost track of you
between now and then.

IF they did do loans with a due date four years from now, the final interest
payment also due would reflect the total interest they expected to get for
the life of the loan, just as if it were being compouded.

The places where loan companies and institutions misserve the public is in
not making full disclosure... quoting simple interest, or the annual rate,
but not the total percentage.

But that\'s like the airline ads that quote Europe flights for $279*

Cost of doing business.  A REAL combat unit should be able to come up with 
a measly MCr10: their gear alone should cost more.  Although you might 
want to scale it as a yearly fee based on TO&E.  There are massive fees in 
many industries today to prevent just this sort of abuse: people 
mascarading as an entity doing business just to gain some of the perks, 
foex, being able to buy otherwise unobtainable weapons, which is what his 
players are doing.  I got the strong impression that this was just a ruse 
for them, and they walked into it blindly.  As a GM, I have no compunction 
about discouraging this direction in my game in this way if it\'s not where 
I want to go...  If they wanted to be a serious merc company, I might feel 
differently about it, but investor backing would probably still be 
required.

The BATF has doing just this sort of discouragement here in the states: 
raising the cost of being an FFL dealer to put the "basement" dealers 
(private citizens who just want wholesale cost and/or the ability to buy 
"devices of destruction").  I totally disagree with BATF, but it\'s one way 
of regulating certain behaviors out of existence.

Some industries are just more difficult to enter than others: we all can\'t 
build oil refineries in our backyards, or develop O/Ses to compete with 
M$.  Another example is radio stations, which anyone could probably do, 
but the FCC requires massive licensing fees for band choice, etc.

Then there is the social concern about folks running around with heavy 
weapons...  Which I\'ve never understood.  "An armed society is a polite 
society."  If we all had tomahawk missiles, who\'d want to be first to 
launch?  (Ooops, I think I may have just started another MAD-war thread.)

I dunno, American football gear is bad enough, imagine 200+ kilos of 
battle armor, and how much it could hurt to get Mr. Winkie caught in your 
servo-powered, armored zipper while trying to "zip up".  I was thinking 
that two-minute base was a bit forgiving...  What about the 
"conveniences"?  Vac suits fall into this category.  Having never had to 
catheterize myself in any fashion (the hospital was always nice enough to 
wait until I was under general anesthetic to do so for me), I can imagine 
that this might take a while; and probably make the suit a lot more 
uncomfortable to wear if ignored and not done prior to donning it...

Ten minutes isn\'t even enough time to hose it out with 409!  I spend more 
than that cleaning my favorite .45 after use...  I must agree that the 
difficulty is a bit high for routine maintenance, though.

Related question: does battle dress "the skill" operate at an eqivalent 
vac suit level, or less?  Vac used to operate as a low grade b/d skill, 
have to look that up in T4.

Have a look at the first Traveller News Service message (originally in JTAS, it 
is currently on the Imperium Games web site.  I think it was included in the 
TNS section of the Fifth Frontier War game).:

to 1000 MW) power plants, which is TL 12 according to FFS 2 ---- I actually 
consider this to be a "reasonable" fit between FFS and real life.

Given that the authors of FFS have got the bits of technology I am familar 
with "about right" (and I ought to know more than them in these few narrow 
fields), it seems reasonable to assume that they have other areas, like 
fission and internal combustion, "about right".  However ...

I always assumed that TL 12 damper technology would let you build smaller 
fission power plants (see FFS 2 page 58) in the same way that it allows 
smaller fussion power plants.  My mental picture of the Unified Handwaving 
Theory sees no problem with TL 12+ fission power densities and minimum sizes 
to rival Fusion+.

For internal combustion, I recall various reports on (for example) the Wankel 
rotary engine where the designers bemoaned the lack of a suitable material 
for the rotor tips that would allow them to make better use of the design.  
Similarly a friend who is a superbike fan was telling me about the materials 
problems that limit the power/weight ratios that could be achieved.  I\'m not 
an expert in these fields, but I feel that improved materials and better fuel 
additives will allow internal combustion to (slowly) improve in fuel 
efficiecy, and reduce in weight and volume.


However, overall, I still like the idea of fission chainsaws (I had not 
intended that as a combat weapon, but as a brilliant trade item to sell to 
lumberjacks on a low tech world ... "this baby runs for a whole season 
without refuelling; the moving parts are easily repaired by local 
tradespeople and the power unit has a 100% money-back guarantee for two 
years."

I\'m not sure I agree with this. It\'s always been implied that jumps go 
\'around\' any obstacles (stars, planets, Zhodani battleships, etc), ie that 
objects in realspace don\'t intrude into jumpspace. There are no misjump 
modifiers for the number of systems you pass along the way. The exceptions to 
this are exit from and entry to jumpspace - you can\'t leave or (safely) enter 
j-space within 100d.

Peter,

I don\'t say it couldn\'t have been covered up. My point is that it altered later continuity. No mater whether anyone in the
later Imperium knew of the voyage, and I have doubts that it could or would have been filed away so completely. It changes
the facts about jump space. Taken from this adventure are several facts never before stated...
1) Jump gates (especially j-gates located ON PLANETARY SURFACES) are possible! Admittedly using ancient technology, but
they are possible, indicating that the 100 diameter rule is not an indisputable physical law! Now I would think that even
if the Gateway in the adventure was destroyed this would lead to some research in the 3I\'s known facts about jump space,
that would show as some impact a thousand years later.
2) Jump "ghosts", I admit my collection is far from complete, but this seems like some interesting information, that
creatures of some type "live" in Jump space.
3) If this particular set of gates were destroyed, and the adventure doesn\'t state that one way or the other, are there
more out there.

My point was that change to the CT, MT, and TNE "Canon" is inevitable when writing in that Conon\'s "past". My view of Canon
is as a guide, every effort should be made to continue the "broad sweep" of "Imperial history" but continuous bickering
about each and every point that disagrees with what has been printed in some book before is senseless and counter
productive. As several people have said before, many of the people playing this game started during the CT era and have
those books for reference, many started during MT and have those books for reference, same with TNE, BUT many (hopefully)
are starting with T4 or will start with Gurps. Unless ALL of the prior material is reprinted, or a Bible is written to
provide a guide, variances WILL OCCUR, probably even if that material is available, so accept what fits your needs and be
grateful it\'s there.

The way I see it is that many prospective authors, with many good ideas, are out there to expand this game. BUT if they
have to spend more time worrying bout EACH AND EVERY minor detail to be sure that there isn\'t an obscure reference in some
out of print book that, they don\'t have available, then actually writing the adventure or supplement, how many of those
authors are going to submit anything? Does every Ref on this list check every book, including the out of print books they
DON\'T HAVE, before writing up that adventure for this Saturday\'s game? I don\'t think so! They try to stay within the broad
sweep of THEIR OWN history, and check things when they think there may be relevance. So if a writer stays within the broad
sweep, and makes what efforts they can to meet accepted "Canon", I feel small glitches should be overlooked or adjusted by
the Ref. Those same authors should receive the praise their efforts deserve, (so they keep on working!), not constant
badgering about this and that non-canon fact, however minor it may be in the long run, or however easy it would be for a
thinking Ref to correct when he/she runs the game.

  Computer Architecture - The "Stempel" Architecture
 
 
- --The "problem" statement--
 
  This Computer Architecture is designed to allow a referee freedom
  in dealing with issues that may be beyond their ability to cope with
  all of the ideas and/or assumptions of what the future evolution of
  Traveller\'s timeline may bring.
 
  Many players are biased by the simple times in which we currently
  live, having lived through a rather phenomenal time period in which
  the development of computers proceeded at a rather rapid rate.
 
  Few could forsee, even in their own lifetimes, the limited usefulness
  of the von Neumann (architecture) machines which they were most familiar.
 
  Consider the following sample dialog:
    
    Ref: "The Zhodani seneschal has given you the integrated library
          data software/database."
    Plr: "I make a backup copy."
    Ref: "You can\'t copy the software. It is designed to grow and learn
          from its interaction with you. Besides, if you could just copy
          the software, you could pirate all the software on the ship\'s
          computer. I can\'t allow that."
    Plr: "It is all just 1\'s and 0\'s, there is no magic to the process. I
          should be able to store the program on disk, copy it, and run it
          as many times, from the beginning, as I want to. I just need to
          setup a Virtual Machine, set the execution steps to monitor the
          progress of the program, and if something changes, I\'ll know it."
 
  The point is here that the referee\'s lack of understanding of just what
  really is possible with a computer, based upon present-day understandings,
  lead to a complete and total distraction to the issue at hand, which is
  having fun playing Traveller.
 
  This gave rise to the following.
 
 
- --History--
 
  The von Neumann architecture was a very logical and popular one given
  its primary attribute:  scalability.  Its primitive memory structure
  gave rise to procedural processing theory, yet it was that very
  limitation that allowed its own failing:  the speed of light.
 
  The Stempel architecture is named not for its inventor, but its first
  Terran interpreter--Simon van Stempel--interpreted from Vilani machines
  which were probably first assembled from remnant Ancient\'s tech on
  Vland.  It was the perfect thing for Terran systems overworked, and
  overtasked for their role in the First Interstellar War.  Terrans
  eventually revised their old admonition to, "Keep It Simple, Stempel."
 
  The Hivers actually improved upon the architecture for their machines,
  thus explaining the differences in their systems.
 
  The retroteching of the Ancients, to allow maintenance at any of the
  most backward of ports, is what allowed the technology to be brought
  down to the most backward of human levels.  Some expertise is required
  to produce the lattice, but it is advanced technology designed for a
  lower tech embedded base.
 
 
- --Description/Details--
 
  Common Terran 20th century terms such as CPU were retained, though they
  are now only arbitrary measurement values, not even actual components in
  the Stempel architecture.  Even activities such as programming, storage,
  and writing programs hold their old labels, while all other similarities
  were lost long ago.
 
  Basically, the Stempel architecture does all processing in linear time.
  Where the archaic von Neumann machines were scalable, i.e. multi-processor
  and multi-programmable, the Stempel machines have a different focus.  The
  best description dates back to van Stempel\'s first papers on the subject.
 
  "While faster and faster processors, to a point, were the hallmark of
  von Neumann machines, the Stempel has run-time as its hallmark achievement.
  Of course, that is not the only thing, just the most pronounced for those
  of us in the \'old school.\'  And yes, just as run-time _was_ scalable,
  now scalability is still available, just not at previously exponential
  rates of growth."
 
  "The achievment of the super-conducting non-determinism tree stores a
  seemingly infinite amount of conclusions, the apparently non-deterministic
  infinite state machine \'processor\' is not CPU or I/O bound as our old
  ancestor was, which by the way, achieved its maximum potential in 2006 AD.
  In the Stempel architecture, for programs which require input, the answer
  is virtually instantaneous for simple problems, and the set of NP-ultra
  problems are computed in a matter of hours."
 
  "The Stempel crystal lattice (tree) holographically stores information
  rather than the old (and primitive) silicon-based feedback-derived memory
  storage systems."
  
 
- --Referee Briefing--
 
  As I said in the Introduction to the Series, Stempel architecture allows
  the Traveller Referee to even justify/explain the AI Virus.  Armed with
  the Stempel architecture, even the unarmed Referee can stand up to the
  most experienced computer expert.
 
  Most direct statements can be answered with, "Sorry, but I\'m using
  Stempel computer architecture in my campaign.  Keep it Simple, Stempel."
 
 
- --The Guarantee--
 
  As long as the user of Stempel Architecture does not "overdefine" the
  technology, _all_ assaults from knowledgeable players like myself, can
  be successfully fended off.  Computer knowledgeable referees may not
  even need Stempel Architecture, but may enjoy incorporating it into the
  campaign as an "alien" computer architecture.
 
 
I\'ll be happy to answer any questions "offline" to assist in the use of
this technique.

  "What Hard Science (or Reality-based) Gaming Means to Me"
 
My short stay on TML this Summer introduced me to a large cross-section
of Traveller fans/players/referees on the \'net.  The TML has a rather
diverse population of people that fit into no mold.  Watching and thinking
and analyzing the events of the "list", culminating with the "spreadsheet"
response, which one of my own players, uninfluenced by TML, echoed the
same sentiments about FF&S2.
 
It recently occured to me that I could try to reach a number of disparate
groups of Travellers with an approach to the status of the game that I
believe is mostly untried.  The bashing of _Fire, Fusion & Steel II (2)_
pointed out several things to me, which brings me to the "hard science"
comment above.  I lifted those words from the sidebar of the article in
Pyramid #25, which I only recently had read.  (A pleasing discovery was
the line, "So, we had to fill in the holes."  Yeeeessssssss, that\'s what
I have been saying for awhile now.)
 
Having nearly completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at
the University of Colorado at Denver, USA, I realized recently, while
playing a gaming session of Traveller, that my referee, in his latest
incarnation of a Traveller campaign c.1100, was trying to approach the
game from as much a "realist\'s" perspective as possible.  Realist is my
euphemism for "gearheading", and like it or not, "gearhead" is becoming
euphemistic.  He had even gone so far as to abandon anti-grav.
 
In the past, I have used a play on the old Traveller slogan, "Science
(Fiction) Adventure in the Far Future."  I have been rethinking this,
and have come to a _major_ realization about the problem with this
attitude.
 
Jay\'s vented frustration, while somewhat heated, was very accurate and
hit right to the point.  I won\'t condemn him on some of the language he
used attacking gearheads, partially because I know what it can be like
to be frustrated to that point, and also because it should have caused
_everybody_ to consider the reasoning behind his claim.  Anyway, onward.
 
That referee I mentioned above, is the only one of our group (he and I
alternate refereeing) without out a "hard" computer background.  I have
been in the industry back to "Jurassic" times (1979).  One player is the
IT director for a large taxi-cab company here in Denver.  Another is a
Software Engineer for Hewlett-Packard in Fort Collins, and the other
player and I used to work together, and now works on computers for the
U.S. government at the Bureau of Land Management.  Two other players
of my former campaign are also computer engineers of one sort or another.
 
We have a combined industry experience exceeding 80 years!  As it turns
out, only my character has Computer skill, derived from his Robotics
skill.  During one session, we got caught up in "what was possible to do
and what wasn\'t" and I got the motivation for this _Traveller Solution
Series_.
 
It is very likely, though he would never admit it, that our referee felt
quite intimidated by his player group.  At the same time, it is possible
that he just did not have a very well thought out "view" of computers in
a "Far Future" setting.  In any case, the level of frustration I felt,
since I was the one with the skill, and the real-world experience, lead
me to design an _entirely new_ Computer Architecture.
 
Having the undergraduate experience tucked away, and realizing that there
are not too many people "pioneering" new computer architectures for several
hundred years down the road, I could make the argument that I have a PhD
for these purposes in Computer Architecture. :)
 
See my next TSS post, number I (1/one), which will be posted to the lists
after this one is, for a Computer Architecture designed to provided a "hard
science" feel for it, and at the same time, leave all the vagueness of
what I call "Black Box Design", where a Jump drive, for example is simply
a man-made machine which weighs X tons, provides performance of Jump-Y in
a ship of Z tons total displacement.  It requires Y*0.1*Z tons of fuel
per Jump-Y.  There are other details, but it really is that simple.
 
Remember:  we can make more and more complex models, but ultimately, all
we have are models, and barely even working prototypes.  I think it would
be really cool if others on the list with areas of knowledge, expertise,
or experience, could provide similar presentations for future subjects to
be posted to the _Traveller Solution Series_.
 
The goal should not be lost sight of:  having fun.  If gearhead bashing
or too much gearheading start interfering with a campaign, it should be
done away with since the orignal goal was to have fun.
 
This post/series is not for everyone, but it may help some of those who
don\'t have PhDs or a lifetime of experience in a given field.
 
Remember, those of us in the scientific community have an obligation to
everyone else we share ideas with.  Many of those with other experiences
may not appreciate being subjected to the ups and downs of scientific
experimentation, building that hypothesis with all of its considerations
and assumptions, then going for the roller coaster ride of publishing the
hypothesis, developing conclusions from it, extrapolating the future, and
then in a few years time, revising the hypothesis given the findings from
the new experience of testing the hypothesis.
 
We _are_ only constructing models of reality, and any sufficiently advanced
reality will always be distinguishable from the models.  We may be
rationalizing our complex models on the basis of our understanding, but that
does not make it any less a "willful suspension of disbelief" than anybody
else\'s.
 
By the way, I was always an opponent of Traveller: The New Era\'s AI Virus
for many of my instincts about what computers are capable of.  Afterall,
they are just 1\'s and 0\'s and with fun things like AI, or expert systems,
or whatever the latest "craze" is, it is easy to lose sight of that fact.
Admittedley, the problem with TNE\'s Virus was not so much the Virus itself,
but its effects on the Universe.  Many of us still attacked the AI Virus
on technical grounds rather than just bellyache, give us back the Imperium.
 
Anyway, TSS#1 can _even_ be used to justify and explain the TNE AI Virus,
which I considered a good test of the feasibility of my design.  Let\'s
put the "Fiction" back with the Science and get the players of this game
back together, rather than petty squabbling about the particular version
we all have a particular fondness for.
 
It can also be used to justify/explain Book 2/High Guard computer tonnages,
energy requirements, etc. or any other computer system for that matter.
 
I invite other TSS subjects to be posted, including alternative Computer
Architectures of the same intent.
 
 
In My Opinion,

	I respect your opinion Kenneth, but I have to say that this 
position has always baffled me.  Traveller has never been about D6\'s or 
chargen.  Traveller is a sweeping future history.  Traveller is a 
remarkably rich, self-consistent gaming background.  Traveller is many 
things, but IMHO, it has never been about what shape your _dice_ are.  
	I can play the Traveller Adventure with a small group of players
and whether we use D6s, D100s, a roulette wheel, or tarot cards, we\'re
still playing Traveller.  For me, the "feel" of Traveller has always had
far more to do with science fiction adventure against a grand interstellar
back drop than the minutia of dice or auto-fire rules. 
	All IMHO, and to each his own.

By 1998 they\'re in South Korea... remember, the US is involved in a total
war when the strategic exchange occurs, and only after that happens does
the whole Civil War/Mexican invasion happen.

Also, (I just checked) Camp Pendelton and El Toro both recieved 50kt gifts
coutesy of the Strategic Rocket Forces.  Add the 1Mt drooped on the Navy
base at San Diego, and there isn\'t much left of the US Military in SoCal.

today, I think the short-term veiw (as far as profits, results, personal

done.  OTOH maybe one major accomplishment per nation per century is
part of the equation and anything else a given political entity is able
to pull off is just gravy. ;-)

	Well, I\'d like to talk to whoever gave you those figures, because
they\'re not at all what I get.  First of all, whether the return that the
bank gets includes the principle is irrelevant.  The bank is purchasing a
stream of cash flows when it makes a loan.  It puts up 80% of the ship
price and in return gets a series of monthly payments for 40 years that
carry a certain risk.  The rate of interest that makes the Net Present
Value of those payments equal to zero is very close to 6%.  You can check
this yourself using the Internal Rate of Return function in Excel.
	Since the ship owner and the bank are investing in the same ship, 
all of the same risk factors etc. apply, so their return should be 
approximately the same.  (Arguments could be made to lower or raise the 
proper return for these two parties, but lets keep things simple).
	Admittedly, this argument is mostly academic since it won\'t 
change the prices you\'ve calculated by too much.  Good job on that, btw.  
It would be nice if T4.1 or _some_ version of Traveller had a rational 
economic system.

I stand corrected, I was thinking about it and researched it. X-boats are
j-4 , the couriers are J-6.

Harold, I don\'t recall there being *any* reference to a ship *in* jumpspace
having the ability to sense anything in normal space.  If that\'s the case,
then the astrogator has no way of knowing when he has "to make adjustments
(to avoid becoming space debris...", and when he doesn\'t.  

In fact, just *how* does one make an astrogation (or piloting, for that
matter) adjustment while in jumpspace?  I thought that with traditional
jump drives once you jumped you couldn\'t affect anything at all until you
precepitated back into normal space (approx. one week later).

I\'ve posted how *my* jump drives work previously, so I won\'t go into them
except to say that I use instantanous trans-location with a week for the
jump bubble to disolve. Someone *on* the ship has to lock onto the target
coordinates, and once a ship commits to jump it\'s done and just have to
take their chances on exactly where they arrive. Unmanned jumps don\'t work
well in my universe, they are possible, but there is *very* little control
over where the unmanned vehicle will emerge in the target system, and
chances of misjump are much higher.

This is just it, and you have the same abhorrent attitude.  Yes, Mir isn\'t
the great, super-duper, can\'t wait to get it up, vaporware NASA space
station.  That much is true.  It is small, it s relatively low tech, and it
had a short life expectency when put up of only a few years before it would
break down...

But, many important experiments were performed on Mir, or with the help of
Mir.

That\'s the bottom line.

Some of the earliest Traveller News Service items. There was one about how

Well, it\'s about assumptions. If a jump drive works exactly the way _SoM_ 
claims, you don\'t even need a full jump drive in the torpedo, just the 
capacitors. Now that you mention it, if you put a full jump drive into each 
torpedo (and if you don\'t, the damn thing will be much too cheap), then the 
ship dosen\'t need a jump drive of its own. But it does need a big enough 
computer and it does need enough fuel to send off a 100 T ship.

Back when I compared these things to X-boats, I calculated that a 1 in 36
chance per jump of losing a torpedo would make an X-torp network slightly
more expensive than an equivalent X-boat network.

Yes, that\'s true.  I find very little reason to believe, however, that Fleet
Couriers were used as XBoats.  I would imagine that Fleet Couriers would be
used more to carry Naval Personnel and information around during "peace time"
and used to move orders and important information around during war time.
 There is a note or two in the Rebellion source book that says they were
sometimes used sort-of-like XBoats sometimes...

The dice are just one aspect of several characteristics that make up
Traveller.  You make a good point, but I\'d say Traveller\'s way of doing
things is one big aspect of the whole "Traveller" feel.

My point was that T4, MT, and CT all have the same "feel" in game
mechanics.  There are different rules in each system--take how autofire
is handled in each of them for instance.  But each one had a "Traveller
feel" to its game mechanics.  I have no problem seeing each of the
different rules (whether it be CT\'s roll two attacks for autofire or
T4\'s double damage for autofire) in either of the systems, because each
were designed with a Traveller mind set.  They took a Traveller approach
to designing the rules systems.

I\'m sorry I\'m being so ambiguous here, but it is hard to put a thumb on
what the Traveller feel is.  It\'s like the discussion we had a while
back on Traveller art.  Foss, while producing good science fiction art,
is just not a "Traveller" artist.  Bryan Gibson, on the other hand, is a
good "Traveller" artist.

What we are talking about here is the Traveller genre.  People get a
feel for it.  The dice--D6\'s--are part of it.  Art is part of it. 
Approach to game mechanics is part of it.

TNE just wasn\'t a part of the Traveller genre.  It didn\'t have the
Traveller feel for a number of reasons.

Let me explain it like this.  Just about everybody has a good feel for
what D&D is.  Now, lets say you play a D&D adventure module, set in a
D&D official world, but you use the Role-Aids rules.

D20\'s and multiple dice to a percentage dice based system.  Different
stats.  Different approaches to game mechanics.  Different rules.

It\'s a totally different feel that is just not D&D.  It is fine if you
want to play Role-Aids, but if you are looking for that specific D&D
feel (which is why you bought D&D instead of Role-Aids in the first
place), it is just not there.

This was the problem with TNE.  It wasn\'t Traveller.  It was a different
game played in the Traveller universe.

Maybe I\'m getting my feeling across here, and maybe I\'m not.  Sometimes
it is hard to describe what you like and dislike about something.  You
just know you don\'t.

Last night I saw an interview with Jennifer Jason Leigh on Letterman. 
My friend said that he didn\'t like Jennifer.  I happen to like her as an
actress.  I asked him what he didn\'t like about her, and he really
couldn\'t tell me.  She just did nothing for him.  At the same time, I
had just as much difficulty putting a finger on why I liked her.  I
simply saw her in some roles,and I thought she did a good job.  When you
start asking me what exactly she did good, it is harder to distinguish.

I think people talking about their preferance for or against TNE falls
in this same category.  I\'ve tried to hint at why TNE didn\'t sell with
me above.

I may or may not have been successful with that.

Kenneth.

Y\'know, embarassed as  am to say t, I had just about almost forgotten about
Skylab :)  My brother and I put a model of it together at my grandparents\'
shorehouse when I was a wee kiddie and then we set it on fire and smashed
it...  For educational reasons of course, simulating atmospheric re-entry of
an unstreamlined hull :).

However, skylab was allowed to fall.  We don\'t have a space station any more,
and Mir\'s still up there chugging along.  I am an avowed Mir lover, and will
be very sad when it finally peters out.

When the damage rating for a weapon that does explosive damage is listed

I know what it is because of the rules in Book 1.

But, my problem comes in with other damage descriptions.  The TL 6

Take a look at the TL 6 recoilless rifle.

Damage
- ----
21 (16 explosive)

What the heck does that mean.  Does the gun do 21 or 16 damage?  Or,
does the gun do 21 damage with 16 of that 21 being explosive?  Or is 21
applied against vehicles and 16 applied against personnel?

How the heck do you read that?


Also, look at the TL 6 heavy cannon.

Damage
- ----
20/25 HEAP



Again, what does that mean?


Or the TL 6 very heavy cannon.

Damage
- ----
25 (14 expl.)/37 expl.



Or the TL 6 medium cannon

Yeah, the way we design/propose designing fusion reactors today you\'re
right.  Given the strong reliance on gravitics, though, I wonder if maybe
fusion reactors might be designed to run at much higher pressures with much
lower temperatures.  Could they use gravitic focusing to maintain the
higher plasma density?  (Lower temperature is relative, of course.;-)

>And the ship *won\'t* explode if you breach the fusion bottle. 

Yeah, but if the fusion bottle is breached then the energy *extraction*
system is probably breached too, and *that* might be a spectacular
explosion. ;->

What about extraction of useful energy from a fusion reactor, ie how do you
turn all the heat and gamma radiation into electricity?  Just how will be
done with Traveller technology, and at what efficiencies?

OK, let\'s put what I do for a living out here. 

I\'m a Combat Engineer.  I conduct assault breaches, which means 
lowcrawling out into machinegun fire ahead of the infantry with 
explosives or wirecutters strapped to my ass, and then I _stop_, and 
breach the wire.  I\'ve done it on MILES battlefields repeatedly, and 
_never_ made it past the wire without that annoying \'screeeeeeeeee\' 
going of.  Which meant if the bullets were _real_, I\'d be deceased.  
And when I\'m not doing that, I\'m clearing land mines.  Now, compared to 
that, your weenie 71L-sitting-at-a-workstation-sucking-your-thumb

Sorry, but that\'s wrong. At the time they *had* to re-boost it, they
didn\'t have anything that could do it. The Saturn rockets had been
turned into lawn displays....

They bet it all on the Shuttle being ready in time, and lost.

Note the "or" up there. Triggerring the ventilation to "High" is the
"non-fire" response. I.E. the software is smart enough to realize it\'s
either a gunfight or a cigar smoker\'s convention. :-)

They\'ve made numerous mistakes over the years, but except for rules mechanics
I can\'t think of many deliberate changes (Or perhaps I should say obviously
deliberate changes; who can know for sure whether this or that inconsistency
is actually a mistake or a deliberate change?). There\'s the importance of
Kinunirs and Gazelles; in early publications they were billed as hot stuff;
later, when someone a GDW figured out just how much building capacity 15
trillion people represented, the Kinunirs and Gazelles became small stuff
compared to what else the Imperium had. That propably count as a deliberate
change (and one I thoroughly approve of, but then, the first version didn\'t
make sense, so it meets my criteria for a proper change in canon).

No reason at all to assume they can\'t do so. In fact, I\'ve mailed a number 
of suggested changes to Mark Miller myself, though much to my regret he
appears not to agree with me about them. I don\'t dispute for a moment that
he is completely within his rights to disagree, but that dosen\'t mean I
don\'t regret it. It increases the chance of IG in the future publishing 
adventures I can\'t use.

If you mean that they really ought to decide whether the _Maghiz_ took place
in -927, -925 or -924, then I agree completely (all three dates have appeared
in official Traveller publications (My preferrence: -924)).

I can\'t agree with you there. If we can\'t even agree on just what constitute
official Traveller material then what\'s the point of discussing anything?

>...and partly because it is obvious that moves were afoot to dump them.

My attitude to suspect Traveller publications is that if they introduce
inconsistencies then they should be ignored, but if they don\'t then they
should be accepted.

>Of course, that\'s neither here nor there. But if you\'re being selective as

I\'m not being selective. I have a very rigid set of standards: If it makes
sense, then I accept it, whether I like it or not; if it dosen\'t make sense
or contradict previously published material, then I reject it.

But if I wrote for IG and used Santanocheev then I\'d either have all the
relevant Journals, in which case I shouldn\'t change canon, or I wouldn\'t
have them, in which case I would introduce an error (Which, depending on
how basic to the Traveller Universe it was, would be either excusable or
inexcusable). But _knowingly_ changing Santy from an incompetent to a
hero would, IMO, be wrong.

That\'s just where you are wrong. Whenever a T4 author builds on CT and MT
and even TNE material, then the T4 newbie is affected by it. The people who 
write for IG really ought to have access to this material, one way or the 
other (even if it is only as a \'continuity sheet\'). I know this has not been 
the case, and that is a big mistake. If IG had made sure that their authors 
had a thorough grounding in Traveller lore (or had had the stuff vetted by 
someone in charge of continuity), all the previously published material
would have served to give a greater depth to the new stuff. 

>And anything that they say that is contradicted in T4 will *not* be 
>regarded as "canon" by the new breed of T4 players 

Yes, but why in the world change things if they make sense? You\'re only 
throwing away work that could have given greater versimilitude to the T4 
material.

OK, so the Annic Nova was painted with letters from a JP language. All that
proves is that it was last painted by someone from the JP. Dosen\'t prove
they built it.

But are you saying that it is a good thing that they\'ve done so (Whether
deliberately or carelessly  --  I still can\'t think of very many changes
that I believe are deliberate rather than errors, but that is really
besides the point)? If you think it is perfectly OK for canon to be so
fluid, why are you bothering to grouse about the PoD at all?

In the sense that jump torpedoes have not been mentioned in any other
publication they are non-canon, yes. But that also means that they are
canon only in the same sense that Kinunirs as Big Macho Ships are canon
and in the same sense that faster-then-light radio is canon (Ie. they 
are really a mistake).

No, it boils down to that I advocate changes to those things that are
inconsistent and accept those things that are consistent. I\'m at a loss
to understand how you can manage to twist that into "accepting changes I
like and rejecting those I don\'t". You\'re logic simply isn\'t.

But unless you\'ve simply decided not to believe in the Plague no matter
what, then it should be possible to identify those assumptions on which
we differ and either work out new assumptions we can both agree on or
agree to disagree. (or, if we agree on the assumptions, we should be 
able to spot the faulty logic on either my part or your part).

I don\'t believe reason is quite so subjective as you imply here. There
are some gray areas, sure, but there are far more places where there is
only one reasonable interpretation. And again, if you really think the
issues are so subjective, why are you bothering to argue about them at
all? If you think that your interpretation of the PoD is no more correct
than mine, why discuss it at all?

But if things are sufficiently vague, people of good will who know about
whatever it is will use that knowledge to shore up the story rather than 
pick holes in it. At least, that\'s what I try to do when I look at a hole 
in the Traveller continuity; I try my damnedst to work out something that 
explains away the inconsistency. It\'s only when I fail that I (reluctantly) 
decide that a change is appropiate.

Sigh. I really wish you would try to read what I write. "1% of the 
population" does not necessarily mean "eaxctly 1% of each planet". It could 
also mean "100% of 1% of the planets" or it could mean (and this is what I 
think fits the known facts best) "a large percentage on some planets and
almost nothing on other planets".

What objective reality? You don\'t know how diseases and cures will be in
the real world in 200 years. (Not that the Traveller universe is identical

You seem to be arguing my point beautifully: An event dosen\'t have to be
the biggest or worst or whatever in order to be remembered. It just has
to be thought worth remembering. So your point that if the PoD \'only\'
killed a measly billion or two of people then it wouldn\'t be remembered
in 1100 is wrong.

Again you\'re arguing my point beautifully. The actual percentage of deaths
are a lot less relevant than the number of survivors that hear about it.

If you are going to claim that the minuscule selection of library data that
has been published in the last 20 years\' worth of Traveller products have
any sort of relationship to what would be available in 1120 if the 
Traveller Universe had really existed, then I\'m dropping this discussion
immidiately. For all we know it IS a minor and mostly unknown footnote.

I really wish you would read what I write. It gets tedious to write the
same things over and over again. As I said in the very paragraph that you 
quote, an immune system that isn\'t exposed to diseases from birth dosen\'t 
develop to it\'s full potential. 

>And now you\'re backing down on the keystone of "canon" in the area!

What keystone? The canon says that the Vilani were affected by diseases that
didn\'t bother the Terrans. Andrew suggested that their immune systems were
inherently weaker than the Terrans\' due to 300,000 years of natural
selection on Vland. I thought that sounded reasonable. You pointed out a
flaw in the argument, and I changed my mind. But canon never said why the
Vilani were suceptible to those diseases; that was Andrew\'s contribution.

You\'re not really trying to work out a reasonable explanation for the
Plague of Duskir, are you? You seem more interested in proving it wrong
no matter what than in making it work. You yourself pointed out that the
Terrans ought to be able to save most of the Vilani. Now we tell you that
_according to the sources_ most of the Vilani did survive. And instead of
realizing that it fits in perfectly with what you\'ve been saying all along,
you try to twist it into not fitting after all.

That is one explanation that seems to fit the facts we have.

Which may be why it is mentioned by the Solomani in _S&A_ and not by the

You seem more interested in pushing your own theory than in working out

No, I never said that, though I know that it was mentioned somewhere (I think
it was in _V&V_). And I don\'t think it was as absolute as you put it. IIRC
the Vilani were less inclined to take prisoners of war, but I don\'t think
it said that they never did. I\'ll check, if you like. (If it did say that
the Vilani NEVER took PoWs, then we have a conflict).

Oh, I get it. You don\'t think that a series of plagues can really be
considered devastating even if it kills, say, 1 out of 2 billion people,
if there happens to be another 98 billion living elsewhere. Just like
an Ebola attack that wipes out an entire village can\'t be considered
devastating because there are billions of people living elsewhere that
never got infected, so the death rate is really only a millionth of a
percent.

designed a .600 Nitro Express revolver.  Wishing to at least partially
emulate his genius, and also to try and push the envelope on FF&S2\'s
firearm design sequence a little, I ran the numbers through FF&S2.  I based
the caliber, length, and rated energy numbers of the historical equivalents
table. Stats follow for those interested

	It was pretty interesting, and revealed what I think to be a
shortcoming in the reciever calculations.  Although the round itself is
only (only?) 76 mm long, the reciever\'s minimum length according to the
FF&S2 design sequence should be 53.38 cm, or 7.02 times the length of the
round, which seems disporportionately long.  This cascades into the mass
numbers, which came out to about 11 kg using standard materials.  As the
original poster (Volker?) stated that the real-world weapon weighed 4 kg or
so, I used TL-8 advanced materials in the reciever, which jacked the price
up.  However, the increased mass really helps with the recoil.  At a loaded
mass of over 10 kg, the recoil is 5.41.  At a mass of 4 kg, the recoil
would be 7.63 (!).  I now understand why nobody is nuts enough to fire this
thing :).

	I would suggest modifying the sequence so that the maximum length
of the reciever for revolvers is no more than 3 times the round length.  I
derived this number using the T.L.A.R. principle.  This would of course
cascade into the mass numbers, fixing that problem too.

surefire munchkin detection test though :).

Originally called the Stanchion gun, this weapon was renamed the Boys 
after the death of its designer Cpt Boys.  The weapon is a massive bolt 
action rifle with the magazine inserted into the top of the action.  The 
muzzle brake, heavily padded butt, and recoilling action were all added 
to the design to help absorb some of the punishing recoil of the rifle.  
Sometimes found mounted on the Bren-gun carrier as a primary weapon, the 
Boys was quickly rendered obsolete as the armor of tanks soon became too 
thick for the .55 bullet to penetrate.

<rant>
The bottom line is the Soviets put up a permanent Space Station while the
US and the rest of the free world sat on their thumbs.  Now with the USSR
broken up and Russia scrambling to find two kopecks to rub together they
are *keeping* it up and working.  Spit and baling wire maybe, have to use
"tap technology" to keep the computer, air system, etc working maybe, but
they, by the great gnu, are keeping it up and working!

What have *we* got?  We have *plans* to build a station
someday...maybe..if Congress doesn\'t cut the funding..if the shuttle
doesn\'t have another accident...if..if!!!

America has diddled away a full generation getting precious little done in
space.  We needed to establish *manned* bases on the moon, instead we
canceled the last two flights, wallowed in Watergate and learned to disco. 
We could have established a permanent station built around Skylab, instead
we let it fall all over Australia.  We needed to build a Delivery Van to
take supplies to a space stations, instead we built a gold-plated Winnebago
(the shuttle) that costs more to launch than Mir\'s yearly budget!  Then we
put all our eggs in that Winnebago and when it crashed..as much because of
Congressional and bureaucratic stupidity as anything..we grounded
*everything* for years while we "investigated" who was at fault, and never
once were the real culprits mentioned!  In the last 25 years we\'ve
*officially* been flat stuck in place spinning our wheels.  The only think
*we* can point to is that we orbited the Hubble Telescope, and even that
had the embarrassment of being nearsighted!

Oh, and the go-cart in a balloon we sent to Mars.  The bean-counters and
the unmanned-robotic crowd have just about sucked the live out of all the
manned programs to the point where, hell!  We\'ve gone to Mars with our
machines, what you want to bet America *never* actually sends PEOPLE?

I\'m no fan of the Soviet system, or Russia for that matter, but at least
they have something more than remotely generated pictures to show for all
their years of effort.  Maybe they *had* to, but they have kept *people* at
the forefront of their explorations, and I envy the hell out of what
they\'ve done with Mir!  Can you IMAGINE what they could be doing with half
NASA\'s budget?  Can you IMAGINE what *we* could do with our technology if
we had half their moxey?

We could learn much about a "can do" attitude from *them*...and that burns
me up!  It\'s supposed to be US, damn it!  We are supposed to be the
explorers, the frontiersmen, the tinkerers that push beyond the possible
and do it against all odds with a "can do" attitude.  Arrgh! I\'m going to
go kick a wall!

    'body' => 'Here\'s a quick little tweak for the list.  

Using this one, small rule change, the T4 chargen system becomes 100%
compatible with any CT or MT chargen system.  

In fact, it makes characters from any of the three rules sets (T4, CT,
or MT) completely interchangeable--including characters generated using
the CT or MT advanced chargen methods.

Remember how Mercenary or advanced Scout characters were so much better
than those created with the standard 4-year methods in CT and MT?  Are
you having to beef up CT and MT characters so that they are compatible
with the T4 characters?

Those problems are a thing of the past--and all you make is one little
chargen rule change.

======================================================================



I like T4\'s new concept of awarding one skill per year.  It gives
Traveller characters more skills and makes them more playable.  The
problem with this is that some T4 characters get to be too powerful and
end up having level 8+ skills straight out of chargen.

Another problem is the compatibility issue I mentioned at the top of
this post.  CT/MT 4-year basic characters were never compatible with
CT/MT characters created using the advanced chargen system,and neither
of these types of systems produce characters compatible with T4
characters.

To fix this, all you have to do is make skill awards the same in each
system.  Official rules state that CT/MT basic characters get one skill
per 4 years (or thereabouts--some get 2 skills per 4 years).  CT/MT
advanced characters get a chance to get a skill every year, if they make
the die roll.  T4 characters get a skill automatically, every year.

My chargen tweak, discussed below, will change all of this with one
simple die roll.

======================================================================

Ken\'s Chargen Tweak for T4

All you have to do to make T4 characters compatible with the CT and MT
systems is change the automatic 1 skill per year award to a die roll.

Each year, a T4 character gets a chance of a skill--if he makes his
skill roll.  This is exactly how it is handled in CT/MT advanced
chargen.

What is your target number?  Use the target number given in the skill
for enlistment (without using any of the DMs).

For instance, a Marine character goes 1 term of 4 years.  The GM will
give the player 4 rolls for a skill--1 roll for each year.

The enlistment number for Marine characters is 5- on 2D6.  The player
rolls 2 D6 four times.  Each time he rolls 5 or less, he gets a skill.

How did I come up with this number?  I did a weighted average
calculation for characters using the CT/MT advanced chargen
system--basically, I figured the average number a character would have
to roll against to get a skill, taking into account percentage chance of
a particular mission and the target number for a skill for that mission.

Amazingly, this comes out (for several different character classes)
close to the enlistment roll (without DMs) for each service.

So, in T4, just use the Enlistment number as a target number to obtain a
skill anytime skill elligibility comes up.

=======================================================================

Ken\'s Chargen Tweak for CT/MT Basic Characters.

Change the award from 1 skill per four years to 1 skill per year, and
roll the enlistment number just as described in the T4 section above.

This will produce characters compatible with T4 and CT/MT advanced
chargen characters.

======================================================================

CT/MT Advanced Chargen Characters.

No changes are needed.  These characters will be compatible with
T4/CT/MT basic characters using my tweak above.

=======================================================================

By using my Traveller chargen tweak, you now have several different
chargen systems for your players to choose from.

There are different skills available in different rules sets.  Also,
some careers are more generous with skill awards than other (EX: Army
characters have a higher target number than Marine characters).

This adds variety to your game.  You end up with more varied
characters--that are still compatible with each other.

You want to roll up a Marine character?  Will that be using the T4
Marine system?  Or, will that be the MT advanced system?  Or will that
be the MT basic system?  Or, do you want to use the system in CT Book
4:  Mercenary?  Or, do you want to use the basic method from CT?

Using any of these systems, with my tweak, will give you a Marine
character compatible, yet different, from a Marine character using
another system.

It\'s simple.  It works.  And it makes some of that old Traveller stuff
useful again in the era of T4.

So, what to do?

Well, email or write SJ Games and let them know what you want -- try their
general email address for Pyramid (Scott Haring, the Editor, is in charge of the
GURPS Traveller project as well) --

pyramid@io.com

And make sure that there\'s plenty of responses! Otherwise we\'ll get the same old
SJ Product which, while adequate, isn\'t all that awe inspiring to look at. And,
after the bad rep that T4 (thanks to IG) has gained in game stores, we need an
outstanding product to attract the new players that IG is unlikely to.

    'index' => 'bw069',
    'month' => '09',
    'body' => 'Let\'s consider a few pertinent "facts" that have been presented in the course of
this argument --

1)  Vilani  immune  systems, as a result of having been in what some people have
claimed was a disease free environment for several hundred thousand years, are
almost totally unable to handle exposure to even harmless Terran bacteria, let
alone actual terran *diseases*.

2) There is no game mechanism to allow of racial Vilani characters to be more
susceptible to Terran diseases.

3) The population of "known space" at the end of the RoM was around 1000 billion
people (per a rough count of the Sector population as per "First Survey")  --
certainly more than this, probably significantly more (as not all the Sectors
that were part of the RoM are covered in First Survey). Allowing for those
areas that are not covered, we can reasonably assume up to half a thousand
billion more.

4) The Plague of Duskir killed around 1 billion people before a "cure" was
discovered, and was widely (though it is never explained *how* widely) spread
through the Ziru Sirka.

5) Terrans were not affected by the PoD.

These facts make some interesting conclusions inevitable.

Firstly, unless you propose some ridiculously high birth rate under the RoM
compared to that of the Ziru Sirka -- something for which there is absolutely no
justification (even allowing for the cloning that it, perhaps, had done in
Solomani & Aslan -- something that is, in itself, contrary to technological
canon -- as that was obviously a wartime measure which would not be justifiable
after the surrender of the  ZS) -- then it is reasonable to believe that the ZS
had a population of between half and one third of the First Survey value.

This means something on the order of a minimum of 350  billion to a maximum of
around 750 billion (and, for what it\'s worth, I  would personally suggest that
the value should  probably be closer to 2/3rds of the RoM totals ... or 650 to
1000 billion), that the death rate from the PoD was 0.3% at best, to 0.13% at
worst (or 0.1% if you assume a 1000 billion pre RoM population).

Fact 6) The Spanish Flu, *the* most lethal plague known to mankind throughout
recorded history, killed around 20 million of the planetary population in 1918
... 20 million out of around 1.2 billion, or about 1.6%!

Fact 7) Most people today would be completely unaware of either a) the existence
of the Spanish Flu or, b) its relative or absolute lethality.

The PoD killed 0.3% *at best* of the pre-RoM populace. We don\'t known how how
widespread it was, but there are hints that it and allegedly terran originated
diseases at the time indicate that it was *very* widespread.

Now, it seems that we really have several options that, regardless of which you
pick, contradict some of the elements that people claim are "canon" ... in other
words, canon is *going* to be contradicted, no matter which you choose. These
options are --

1)  Vilani  immune systems were 99% effective vs. Terran  diseases -- which
means that they  were so close to being identical as to have no real
differences. This meshes with the facts that there are, and have never been,
separate rules for the vulnerability of racial vilani to terran diseases in the
game system *and* that less than 1% of the Ziru Sirka\'s population died.

Claims to the effect that it is only because *current* Vilani are the
descendants of those Vilani that survived the PoD that there are no rules for
special disease vulnerability are obviously going to run up against the brick
wall of a 99% or greater survival rate of the *original* Vilani.

And claims that the Vilani were such a tiny minority of the populace within the
re-RoM Ziru Sirka obviously do not mesh in any way with the longevity and
tenacity of Vilani elements in Milieu 0 and 3rd Imperium society. Even claims
that Vilani culture supplanted that of locals forcibly brought into the empire
does not wash -- if *that* was the case(and I beg leave to doubt it was more
than a thin facade at best), then it would have been replaced even more totally
with Terran elements than it was.

2)Terran precautions, based on the long term contacts that the Interstellar Wars
represent, to minimise the impact of Terran diseases on a basically defenceless
Vilani populace (and non-Vilani minor races would be equally vulnerable for
reasons that have also been canvassedZ) must have been almost completely
successful. After all, 99% or more of the populace of the Ziru Sirka survived
unaffected by any diseases.

3) The PoD was basically a beat-up. The fact that it appears only in Solomani
and Aslan *and* is mentioned by "the authors" is, I would contend, immaterial
here. The facts are that the PoD killed less than 1% of the populace of the
Ziru Sirka, and that this is such a tiny amount that the alleged prominence is
immediately suspect.

I would quite readly agree that this was probably because the authors either a)
didn\'t have a clue, or b) couldn\'t be bothered to think things through with
what had already been published, or c) made a glaring error.

Personally, I think the only acceptable conclusion is probably b).

Given that they didn\'t think things through, then someone has to. We *know* that
less than 1% of the pre RoM populace of the ZS died, and we are *told* that some
*Vilani* scientists came up with a cure for the PoD. Since we are *also* told
that the Vilani medical tech was so poor, this seems unlikely -- so, for a
person who wants minimal changes to canon, it seems that we would have to
suspect that the story of who discovered the "cure" for a disease (and we are
actually  told that it was a constellation of unrelated diseases) that he had no
experience with, and using technology that he had no previous knowledge of or
access to must be just *possibly* a disinformation effort. It makes a lot more
sense than believing that some Vilani dude came up with the solution!

No, the *logical* solution has to be that the PoD was a minor event that  has
been given a going over and has been blown out of all proportion by *someone*
for their own purposes; purposes that have nothing to do with "reality", but
with the *manipulation* of reality.

Who could be behind such a campaign?

Given the primary source of info on the PoD and its alleged curer is in Solomani
and Aslan, it seems that it has to be either --

a) The Solomani, or

b) The 3rd Imperium, or

c) The Vilani within the 3rd Imperium.

I suppose that we *could* include a possible psychohistroy manipulation by the
Hivers, but it seems unlikely.

Lets look at them.

a) Why would the Solomani do it? There seems, on the face of it, to be more that
they would risk than gain. Possibly, though, it was for internal political
consumption to make a point about how ruthless they were in the "good old days"
and being aimed to prepare the people for some truly ruthless and despicable
move against the 3I. Gven what we know of the Solomani party, it seems possible.

b) The Third Imperium, why would they do it? They draw legitimacy from
their alleged descent from the RoM, and would hardly want to connect this with
some allegations of terrible crimes by the RoM or *its* predecesssors.
I suppose it is *barely* possible that the RoM used this beat-up as an excuse
for Estigaribbia\'s coup -- after all, he *claimed* that he was doing it to
protect the Vilani from mistreatment by the TC, in which case the 3I might allow
as it happened that way ... you  know, the glorious founder of the 2I was
fighting against the vile acts of his putative superiors, justifying his
otherwise illegal and unjustifiable acts (the coup).

c) The Vilani? Well, we know from published material that the ZS refounded
itself after the collapse of the RoM and had to be cajoled into the 3I ... so,
perhaps it is a case of Vilani racial loyalists trying to cast doubts about the
legitimacy of the origins of the now Terran dominated Imperium (socially if not
racially)?

Whatever is the case, I think its fairly obvious that the PoD is a beat up by
*someone* with an axe to grind, and bears as much relationship to reality as
Fairy Floss does to food.

 The natives of the planet would have to wear exo-skeletons or grav

	we had a similar scene :

	After a fire exchange the players where in the engine room while
	a ling standard police robot 317 was in the cargo bay. The
	computer decidet to decompress the engine room slowly using the
	life support. Lutz managed his roll to become aware of this,

	Its a typical kind of extra tax. E.g. in Bremen we have the
	"Buergerpark Tombola" financing the Buergerpark which is quite
	large (about 10% of state Bremen). The people are buying those
	lottery tickets not because the high chance of winning a new

	a ticket anytime they are on market. A statistic sais that any
	in bremen is buying 3 tickets per month (1DM ~ 0.7$) and as Bremen
	has a population code of 5 and a modifier of also 6, this it a
	lot of money. Those money is not wasted in a tax for burocrathy
	but directly used for the park, people enjoy paing this extra tax
	much more.

Interestingly put, but yes, this is true.  Diesels run compression
ratios in the neighbourhood of 18:1 while gasoline engines are closer
to 8:1 or 9:1.  High performance motors run higher ratios, but also
require fuel with gobs more octane to compensate.  Higher compression
ratios aren\'t really a "waste", exactly-- more like "counter
productive".

Yes, but In Nomine\'s interior art, like a lot of GURPS art,is crap.

They\'ve got this great, mysterious, grabbing, somewhat mystic cover for

Sylean Federation and later 3I were bureaucratic governments ... there is
going to be a lot of paperwork,and limited rights of waiver (unless you
have the appropriate Imperial authority).

Nukes are a touchy issue in the 3I. On one hand, fission power is very useful 
at TL9-11, due to the large minimum sizes of fusion power plants
(especially in
TTA/FFS2). On the other hand, the 3I is very very big on no-one but it having 
nukes. And if you have lots of radioactive fuel floating about to power all
those fission power plants in private hands, then far too many people have
access to 
material which could be refined to weapons grade.

Oh and you can absolutely forget det-lasers or mining nukes in private
hands. If
the Imperial Rules of War forbid the possession of nukes, then *all* nukes are
forbidden. If that means some belters have a harder time making a buck or some
civilians have to rely on the Navy for protection against pirates, so be it.

In my view, the net result would be the Imperial authorities encouraging
use of
fusion and (spit) Fission Plus rather than Fission technology. The main
method of
this would be very heavy safety paperwork for Fission power plants on
Imperial territory
(eg your neighbourhood starport - maybe an Average skill roll against the
lower of Admin and Engineering each time you enter a starport with a
fission power plant, to fill in the Request for Safety Cerification
correctly), and heavy taxation on radioactives travelling within Imperial
space (about KCr80 per cubic meter sounds about right).

Next, Imperial interest rates. The Imperium seems to me to be a
zero-inflation economy, with a very very hard Imperial credit ... kind of
like the British pound in the days of Empire (incidentally, someone talked
about wage-push inflation recently. Do the math - it only happens when you
drop the assumption that business acts in order to maximize profits. Which
one probably should do if one is trying to model a 20th century economy,
but that is another issue). I think about 3% is about right for zero-risk
investments, which means your average Free Trader will be paying about 6%
interest on borrowed money.

By the way, has anyone else wondered why Free Traders tie up all that
working cargo in a starship, rather than by buying the speculative cargo
and leasing the starship on a monthly basis ?

And of course there would be no resistance [ red dawn ] and all the
reserve , guard units would be in europe and asia . the leaving us open
for invasion . did the U.S. do this in WWII ? I thought there were home
guard units and other defense forces defending the nation at all times ?

look , I should not have attempted to interject reality into a game and I
did not mean to insult the french or any other nation in the world with
my opinions and thoughts . I will never buy into the U.S. main land being
invaded by a coalition of third world banana republics [ the caribbean ]
and I will never believe that the U.S war machine could be shut down buy
nuclear strikes against major population areas and training bases .
	In time of nuclear threat the major pop. centers would be on
alert and possibly evacuated . also most of the arms producing factories
have enough supplies in stock pile for years of total war . this goes
doubly for fuel , and in addition 98% of the fuel pumped in alaska goes
to the military reserves . also we [ the U.S ] have a few different
methods of protecting itself from ICBM attacks . such as the satellites
that launch metal rods into space to intercept the ICBM in space and
destroy it . also I remember reading about satellites that bombard
incoming ICBMs with micro wave which fry the circuitry and disable the
weapon .  third is the anti missile missile .
	this is tech that is up there , you can bet on it . also the fact
that soviet missiles are known for the unreliable nature and lack of
accuracy , it is odd that in T2000 every missile hit its distinction .
and lastly the boomers would have reduced mexico and the rest of the
invading nations to slag for the impunity . 
the U.S military trains for the nuclear theater [ I  know we did ] and I
assume all militaries do .[ comments ] that means the U.S. has
contingency plans for maintaining the infrastructure , national security
, and ability to wage war into the nuclear exchange .
yet in T2000 the U.S. is caught flat footed and defenceless . right and I
got a bridge to sell you . 
  
	I would like to know exactly how much thought and research went
into the background and probability but it looks a little thin to me .
also france staying out of a major war in europe ? no way . france is a
strategically important and central nation and would be forced into the
war . either to support NATO or by the soviet mediterranean fleet and
airdrops into strategic locations  in the hopes of cutting supply to NATO
forces . or maybe to preempt NATO operations . [ ex. nuking major
shipping ports . ect . ] of course this is all theory and I could be
wrong ..:>}


anyway , not trying to bust on anyone elses country or impose american
imperialism , just trying to support my point of view .

I agree with John Macpherson. What does it matter what dice we used? I
invented a new combat system - and at one time used Laserburn. It was still
Traveller. I like the traditional Trav chrgen etc, but it\'s not essential.
So what is essential?

The background. The setting. The Fun!

By the way; a recent comment mentioned that the Imperium was never seen as
oppressive etc. Hmm... remember Adventure 1: Kinunir? References to
disappearing senators, political prisoners and civil rights violations. Of
cousre, the game setting was in its infancy, and under the influence of too
much Star Wars.
That angle quietly vanished in favour of the more open Imperium we now
remember it has always been.

This sort of thing happens when you publish a background without
playtesting it for a decade or so first - you find later on that some of
your initial assumptions are innappropriate. So you write around them,
explain them away, or quietly let them drop. 

The result is much the same anyway.

For those of you who are not familiar with this, 1001 Characters
supplement you can use to roll up a quick NPC in the middle of a game. 
The book is sectioned into chapters, and there are sections for Navy,
Marine, Army, Scouts, Merchants, and Other character types.  You random
roll, and there, at your finger tips, you have a quickie NPC with one
die roll.

There are also lists for Encounters, for GMs who are using encounter
charts.  There\'s a table for army patrols, policemen, and two tables for
thugs.  

The very last of the book details 9 NPCs taken from popular sci-fi
literature.

I use my copy of the book for my T4 campaign all the time--when I\'m in a
pinch for a quick character, and there is no real problem using this
book for T4 eventhough it was published for CT.

I bought the book for $7, and I\'ll send it to anybody who is interested
in it for that same price plus a buck for postage (or whatever it costs
if you are overseas).

Or, I\'ll trade for something I need in my collection.  

I need a bunch of things, but what comes to mind right now is the
Imperial Fringe adventure, Supplement 7:  Trader\'s and Gunboats, and the
Undersea Environment by Gamelords.

I\'m sure I can think of other things I need (Like Adjutant supplements),
so if you have duplicates of things in your inventory you are willing to
part with, contact me in private.

Sorry, but up till at least the late 80\'s NASA did have one Saturn V sitting
around unused and unallocated (and not turned into a gigantic piece of lawn
furniture). For a while they even considered selling it off to private
enterprise. But they held on to it for \'contingencies\'. What killed Skylab
was that at the time nobody understood just how dangerous a solar flare
maximium could be. Firstly nobody expected that Skylab was in any danger, then
when it became obvious that it was coming down, nobody anticipated just how
fast it would come down. There was only about three months between finding
there was a problem and Skylab splattering all over the outback. Not enough
time to plan a mission, let alone get congress to approve funding! One must
remember that Skylab was never intended to be a permanent station. I think
from memory it\'s expected life was three years, and like Mir it was a cobbled
together mismash of bits. And Skylab had its fair share of problems during
it\'s operational history (failed solar panels, a serious overheating
problem).

    'body' => 'A lot has been said about the weakness (or lack thereof) the Vilani immune
system. I was the person who apparently first postulated this so let me
expalin why the at the time of contact the Vilani immune system *has* to
be weaker than the Terran. This is not taken from Traveller \'canon\', this
is taken from hard science. If Traveller is to be a \'hard science\' game, then
the Vilani *must* have had a weaker immune system. Anything else means totally
ingoring our current knowledge on both the immune system and evolution.

It might help to give a quick run down on just how the human immune system
works. Firstly the human immune system is not in fact a \'system\' in the
strict biological sense. It is in fact a set of complex biochemical
interactions between a number of different types of cells. As we understand it
now, the immune system is comprised of 3 distinct groups of cells (Phagocytes,
T type lymphocytes and B type lymphocytes). This is how the immune sytem works:

Phagocytes constantly patrol the blood stream looking for material that is
\'foreign\' to the body (these are the cells that cause organ rejection). They
respond by attempting to \'devore\' the offending material and releasing a
chemical which causes a Helper T cell to come and investigate. Phangocytes
are perfectly adequate for most inorganic materal (though some like asbetos
can cause them problems) but are unable to destroy cells fast enough to cope
with an organic invasion, since they cannot identify what they are attempting
to \'devore\' they call a helper T cell which will activate the immune response
if a pathogen is present.

There are several million types of helper T cells, each one \'trained\' to
identify a particular disease organism. These helper T cells are one of the
wonders of evolution. As far as we can tell, we are born with the capacity to
produce helper T cells which can identify any disease organism any of our
ancestors have survived (this is the key to inherited immunity); more than
this, if none of our helper T cells can identify a pathogen, the thymus (where
the helper T cells \'live\') can \'train\' cells to identify the new pathogen (we
have not an incling how they do this). The helper T cells bind themselves to
the Phagocytes which has \'devored\' a foreign organism. If the Phagocytes has
not encoutered the specific pathgen the helper T cell recognises nothing
happens, but if the helper T cell does regonsise the pathogen all hell breaks
lose. In this case the helper T cell detaches from the phagocyte and rushes
to the spleen and lymph nodes. These release a chemical which causes the brain
to raise the body temperature (increasing the immune cells effectiveness). The
helper T cell stimulates the B cells in the spleen to start production of
killer T cells and antibodies.

The antibodies and killer T cells rush to the site of the infection. The
antibodies binds themselves to the previously identified pathogens, marking
them, slowing them down, rendering them unable to attack healthy cells (in
the case of viruses), and allowing other chemicals produced by the body to
attack and destroy the pathogens. Meanwhile the killer T cells indentify
foreign or infected cells (we don\'t know how they do this either) and attack
and destroy them.

Somehow (again we don\'t know how) the helper T cells are able to detect when
the infection has been defeated. At this point they instruct some of the
B cells to start production of suppressor T cells. These T cells cause the
B cells to slow down production of antibodies and killer T cells, allowing
the body to return to it\'s pre-infection state and preventing the a runaway
immune system from destroying the body.

Now while all this is happening the B cells will produce a \'few\' memory T
cells. These T cells remember the chemical signature of the pathogen and
continue to float around in the blood stream for years. If they ever
encounter the pathogen again they short cut the immune response and allow
the body to respond several orders of magnitudes faster. It\'s these cells
which are responsible for immunities gained after birth. The difference
between these cells and helper T cells is numbers. Whilst we may have a few
helper T cells capable of identifing measles, if we ever catch measles we
will have many many more memory T cells capable of identifing measles. Thus
while we produce a helper T cell which can identify measles, we can still
\'catch\' measles; but if we have a memory T cell which can identify measles, we
will not \'catch\' measles.

Innoculations (vaccinations) work by fooling the helper T cells into believing
that a serious infection is underway with the goal of producing memory T cells
for the specific pathogen being innoculated against. (Note: one can
innoculate against both viruses and bacteria).

Okay, so what does all this mean for the Vilani? Firstly they have not
enocuntered any pathogen that has evolved on Terran since they were removed.
This means they will not have helper T cells for virtually all current Terran
diseases, thus making their immune response slower and less efficent. Sure
they may have helper T cells for a few pathogens the Terrans have never
encountered; but nothing like the number of new pathogens that have evolved
on Terra in the past 300,000 years. However, those who survive the first
onslaught of a particular Terran pathogen or who are innoculated against it
will pass on helper T cells to the decendants. Also interbreading between
Terrans and Vilani will further spread the vital helper T cells. Any Vilani
who has a Terran anywhere in their ancestory will have access to the vast
Terran \'library\' of helper T cells.

Secondly; simple genetics means that individuals are born with immune response
systems of differing levels of effectiveness. On Terra those individuals with
weaker systems are more likely to die and thus less likely to pass on their
weaker immune system to their decendants. Thus on Terra, the human immune
response will slowly get more efficent. However on Vland, those individuals
born with weaker immune responses are no more likely to die and therefore
just as likely to pass on that weaker immune system. Therefore random genetic
mutation on Vland means that their immune system will gradually get weaker.
This ignores the fact that since the immune response system is so energy
intensive, those individuals on Vland with weaker immune responses actually
are *less* likely to die and *more* likely to pass on their genes.

Therefore common sense tells us that the Vilani have to have had an immune
response system noticeably less effective than the Terrans when the first
contacted them. Realistically no other conclusion is possible. If canon states
this is not the case, then canon is simply flying in the face of scientific
reality.

So, putting it altogether, without massive outside intervention (and I am
talking a truely massive intervention), when the Vilani encounter the Terrans
with their vast host of accompanying pathogens, there will be a very dramatic
\'culling\' of the Vilani. The only way to prevent this is a innoculation
programme unlike anything ever before. However, since the effectiveness of
innoculation is totally dependant on the effectiveness of the individual\'s
immune response; many Vilani will still fall victim to the first onslaught
of Terran diseases.

Now assuming this innoculation programme is maintained over many generations
of Vilani, the Vilani immune response will slowly increase through evolutionary
selection and interbreeding with the Terrans (this is the major factor) to
the point where it is as effective as the Terran.

Some canon points to support this are: all the CT essays on the Solomani
Terrans) mention that interbreeding has essentially merged the Vilani and
Solomani throughout most of the Imperium. Other essays tell us that the
Vilani have essentially ceased to exist as a seperate genetic race, existing
only as a cultural grouping within the Imperium.

These three items are the Seeker 25mm deck plans.  All three are in
fantastic shape and have never been used.  The plans are still stapled
inside the supplement.

I\'ve got plans for:

400 ton Lab Ship (Includes 40 ton Research Pinnance)

400 ton System Defense Boat (Includes attaching Jump Shuttle)

400 ton Subsidize Merchant  (Includes 20 ton Launch)



Each plan includes a referee\'s overview of each deck deck on a single
page, commentary sections on the craft (discussions on operating the
craft, variants, etc.), a short story focussing on the craft,outer
side/top/rear/front views of the ship, and a cross section drawing
showing deck height and relative human size.

Oh yeah, don\'t let me forget.  The main part of each supplement are the
25 mm deck plans.  The plans are highly detailed (not like those yucky
plans in Starships) showing chairs, computer consoles, hatches,
drives--in short,everything aboard the ship.

There\'s also a page that you can photocopy/cut/fold/paste for figures if
you don\'t have minitures or card board counters.

Since my group uses a Subsidized Merchant, I use my set of deck plans
all the time.  It is nice to pull them out on a moment\'s notice when you
need detailed information on the inner workings of the ship.



If you have items you want to trade for these, or if you want to buy
them, contact me by private e-mail.

I don\'t have a problem with the idea that "gravity wells" intrude into
J-space. Or that running into one can drop you out of j-space. After
all, you can\'t "see" anything outside your jump bubble. Assuming that
transit time between any two "wells" is always a week is no more of a
stretch than having jumps always be a week is anyway.

And it actually makes a *little* sense that there has to be *some*
connection between j-space and n-space. If there wasn\'t, we\'d have no
way of getting there.

Actually, you *can* get into broadcasting cheaply. But you have to be
willing to limit your range to your neighborhood. "Carrier Current"
broadcasting requires about a grand for the transmitter, and a modest
fee for the license.

Well, we have the bad example of the "mob" with tommyguns back in the

For males, you use an *external* catheter. This is essentially a
*heavy* condom with some adhesive to help hold it on. It has a tube
running from a resevoir at the tip to the waste connection. *Much*
easier to put on. 

And given lube and training, it takes all of about a minute to insert
an internal cath. Women have it a bit easier, as their urethra is a lot
shorter, and pretty much a straight shot (none of the bends that making
putting a cath in a male so tricky).

The "fun" part is dealing with the "solid waste". In space suits, the
best we have so far are diapers (disposable diapers are a spinoff of
the space program!)

That\'d take a *lot* of gravity. And then you\'d have to turn around and
negate it to keep the structure of the reactor from *flowing* under the
pressure due to gravitational stress.

And it would appear that 6 g is the most that can be generated...

Depends on *how* you extract it. Since the "topping" cycle is likely to
be MHD, breaking it won\'t be *that* spectacular.

Well, as with most power plants, you\'ll likely have several stages. the
"topping" cycle works with the highest temp "working fluid" and thus
has the highest efficiency. Then you can have one or more secondary
extraction cycles that work off the "low" temperature exhaust of the
topping cycle. 

I figure MHD would be best for running hot plasma thru. You\'d also run
some sort of coolant thru the reactor walls to carry off the heat from
absorbed gamma rays and the like. That could go thru a conventional
steam turbine type cycle. 

And the "low end" cycle could be heating the LH2 and running a turbine
off the resulting hydrogen gas.

Actually, I can see situations where the ref is *right*, but for the
wrong reasons. It\'s possible, and even *likely*, that a lot of what we
consider "software" will be closer to the ROM-paks used in games. Sure,
you can copy it. But it isn\'t worth the trouble.

Or they may have solved the piracy problem by having all computers have
a "hardware serial number" (more like a PGP signature). In which case,
your software won\'t *run* on another system without the manufacturer
"re-keying" it to the new system.

Take a combination of the two and you have the computers from S.M.
Stirling\'s "Draka" timeline. Where keeping the system from being
compromised is the single most important design criterion.

These are possible, but "simpler" answers than your "Stempel
architecture". And what little we can forsee of quantum computers makes
things *really* messy.

Finally, there are computer OSes that already exist where you the OS
won\'t *let* you backup up software flagged as "no copies allowed". And
they have access restrictions on files as well. Unlike MS-DOS, these 
are built in at the OS level. Combine such an OS with protected mode
hardware, and the only way to "crack" things is with custom equipment
built *specifically* for the purpose of violating security. 

The existing OSes that do this aren\'t on secure hardware, so by use of
some ASM trickery, you can create things like sector editors so you can
crack the protection. On hardware with "protected" mode, the OS doesn\'t
allow this. Add encryption, with the key in the OS, and you are going
to have special hardware and software such as I mentioned above.

You get any military and a civillian together, and the military will 
band together against the civillian.  

You get members of all four services together, and the other three will 
band together against the Air Force.

You get just Army personell together, and the combat arms will split 
vs. the REMFs

You get just combat arms together, and Combat Engineers are the odd man 
out.

It\'s one of my pet peeves.  But putting up a manned station is not 
something I\'d like to see done wrong.  I\'d have been much happier if 
the damn thing were already up, and it could have been.  But I\'d rather 
see it done right than done tomorrow.

One of the saddest things I\'ve ever read about was an incident a few 
years ago when one of the Apollo astronauts was given a 
NASA-cheerleading speech once, and a college student stood up and ask, 
"Sir, is there any chance of the United States achieving the goal, in 
_my_ lifetime of putting a man on the moon and returning him safely to 
Earth?"  And the answer is basically, no.

    'body' => 'I read an article a few years back about Huge Handguns (or Munchkin
Detectors if you like).

There was a feature about an Australian bush ranger (6 foot 6+ and built to
match), who carried no rifle but an Express .600 revolver. He\'d fired it
often enough to be familiar with it (and the kneeling fire position it
required) - and asserted that, \'yes, it really will stop a charging
buffalo!\' Scary.

I assume that the reason security patrols aboard supercarriers etc carry
shotguns in something to do with not wanting to penetrate the inner walls
(no chance of damaging a bulkhead). I assume spacecraft have similarly
flimsy internal partitions covering vital machinery. But CSA (common sense
applies). Small-calibre handguns and smgs, especially those firing plastic
\'safety\' ammunition designed to reduce penetration (e.g. glaser), shotguns
and such weapons are not going to do much more than damage the walls.
Consoles, however....
	
A single Gauss needle is so unlikely to do any major damage - i.e. anything
that can\'t just be left for routine maintenance - that it\'s irrelevant.

But since some boarders like to use Battledress (this is fairly uncommon
outside military actions, and I\'d imagine that heavy bulkheads in the
regions likely to be boarded, protected cabling etc would be standard on a
military hull), there might be a reason for firing LAGs, laser rifles and
heavy weapons inside a starship. Other than wanting to die, that is.

I\'d divide boarding weapons into these categories:

Negligible Risk: Spectacular failure might damage something fragile, but
don\'t worry about it.
Weapons such as body pistols, normal handguns and smgs, shotguns, bows,
rifles firing \'shipboard plastic ammunition, etc. I.e. weapons with little
penetration, or altered to have less than usual.

Minor Risk: Automatic rifles, lasers, frag grenades, gauss rifles. Any
missed shot might require a \'catastrophe roll\' if the referee feels the
situation to be appropriate. Weapons will chew up rather than destroy the
target system, thus causing less damage than:

Major Risk Weapons: LAGs, 30mm machine-guns, RF gauss weapons, explosives.
Any shot not stopped by an absorbent target (read: living body) WILL
proceed onwards and possibly break something, Whatever is hit will be at
least badly damaged. Doom-death-munchkins will note the maximum damage
rules - most of these weapons will come out the back of an unarmoured
target and THEN break something else!

\'Maniac\' weapons: Autocannon, Heavy explosives, plasma weapons.
Any discharge is going to damage SOMETHING, even if the target is hit.
Firing Plasma in Engineering or Bridge areas is just not on. But some
nutter will no doubt try it.

If you want a table, try this one I just made up:

Target: (2D)
2-3 Vital System with immediate dangerous result (Life Support, Weak Hull
Area, Fuel pipes)
4-5 Important but non-vital system (Backups controls, Computer backup
memory)
6-7 Impressive cosmetic damage (Wall paneling, Captain\'s dress uniform)
9-10 Expensive but \'irrelevant\' item (Luggage, Cargo, Ship\'s Cargo Bot)
11-12 Vital system, probably without immediate result (but bad news all the
same): (Control Consoles, Control Wiring, Drives)


Damage: Roll 1D, add number of dice damage weapon does after first
subtracting any armour value assigned to walls, etc:

1-3: Slight dent, hole etc.
4-6 System looks worryingly damaged, but is easily fixed.
7-8 System is degraded in performance and needs minor repairs
9-10 System is severely degraded (50% chance  failure is complete). Major
repairs required.
11-12 System is knocked out but repairable. Major repair job.
13+ System is destroyed. Backups may still function.

A normal partition wall might be given a value of 2?

The referee must choose appropriate system from those likely to be present
in the combat area, or along a line of fire from there. Common Sense
Applies.

This sort of thing can be great fun - Pirate Petrov looses off an ACR-10
down a corridor towards the open bridge valve. Astrogator Tim dives aside.
4D of damage (doubled to 8 for autofire by a sadistic referee) slams into
bridge machinery. Referee rolls 1D and gets a 5. That\'s 13 - something is
destroyed on the bridge.(Which could include expendable \'extras\' but not
PCs). Players tense up as the ref rolls for system hit - a 7! The captain\'s
coffee mug is shattered, the Emperor\'s portrait gains another nostril, but
the damage is cosmetic. (The effects of a mugful of Platimun Blend down the
Nav console are up to the referee\'s sick imagination). The crew return fire
carefully, painfully aware of the open Engineering valve behind Petrov
(what a bunch of idiots. Perhaps they deserve to get their Jdrive shot up!)

Now we have a problem appearing for characters - whether use heavy AP
weapons or lighter antipersonnel ones for boarding - you can\'t smash up
fuel pipes with a shotgun, but you can\'t stop battledress either.

I\'d imagine that by TL 12, propellants would be cleaner, thus sidestepping
the \'indoor firing range\' effect we all love so well. But what of a
boarding using Black Powder weapons. Now that\'s be fun! Two shots and the
ship\'s full of acrid smoke!

Alternatively, so far as normal boarding goes, I\'d say it would be possible
to ignore the effects of \'minor\' weapons unless someone messed up badly,
and only worry about heavy overpenetrating or explosive rounds. The effects
could be \'guesstimated\' by simply rolling 2D and adding the weapon\'s damage
number.Anything over about 10-12 is serious, anything over 18 is
potentially catastrophic - say someone caps off a body pistol. Ref ignores
potential damage as trivial. A Laser Rifle? Ah. Roll 2D and add damage
rating of 7. Roll is a 7 = 14: something is damaged. Referee makes
something up. Or uses my table, above.

Of course, this does not take into account deliberate close-range damage
using guns, such as firing a handgun directly into a console or fuel feed. 

Ricochets and unaimed spray fire:

In the situation where an SMG burst ricochets from a bulkhead, or someone
shoots though a partition wall with armour-piercing ammo at someone they
can\'t see but guess is there, I turn the situation on its head and ask
characters to roll NOT to be hit.

A character\'s \'luck\' is the sum of his/her highest physical stat (STR, DEX,
END), plus highest skill number. Roll luck as a task NOT to be hit -
Average for a couple of shots fired through concealment such as a bush or
thin wall, or a ricochet situation. Difficult for a burst, Formidable for
Rapid-fire. Failure means that the character has been hit for half damage.
Spectacular failure is full damage.

Thus it is possible to target someone who you can\'t see but who might be
behind that bush. He will gain armour protection from the
wall/bush/cardboard box as appropriate. The firing character can use half
his weapon or all his Forward Observer skill to estimate the shot, and
deducts this from the target\'s chance of NOT being hit.

EG: Gunner Bob dives past the open cargo hold valve. Pirate Petrov sees
him, but can\'t turn in time. Instead he guesses where Bob will be and
sprays his rifle through the internal partition. Petrov has Rifle -3, so
subtracts 2 (rounding up) from Bob\'s chance to avoid damage. Bob\'s luck is
given by his END of 9 and his Sensors skill of 3. Thus his target is 9+3-2=
10. Petrov fired a burst, so the roll is Difficult. 2 1/2 dice give a total
of 11. Bob is hit. But first the ref rolls for damage to systems within the
wall. A 7 gives cosmetic damage only - the wall is chewed up pretty bad,
but that\'s it. Bob is granted 2 points of armour for the thin partition
wall, and takes half damage from the random burst. That\'s 4-2 dice, halved
for blindfire, doubled for auto fire - 2D. Bob takes a couple of hits. He
brilliantly returns fire through the still substantially intact wall,
firing a single shot from his 2D autopistol. The ref knows this can\'t
penetrate a 2-armour-point wall, so demands a ricochet roll. Bob\'s luck is
12 (it\'s not reduced by damage). It\'s a single shot, so difficulty is
Average. Bob rolls 2 sixes - spectacular failure! The round comes straight
back and hits him for 2D (full damage on a spectacular failure, half
otherwise). Bob takes more damage and passes out.

Next round, Petrov hoses more ammo through the wall rather than leap into
the bay and be ambushed by Bob (He thinks). The ref rolls some dice but
ignores the result, leniently ruling that Bob has suffered enough, and
being unconscious, can\'t be hit. A sadist might roll to hit anyway, with
Bob\'s unconscious body being further mangled by blindfire. But this
referee, unlike me, isn\'t a sadist.

Blindfire like this can be great fun - players don\'t know whether their
target is hit or not. It\'s not so difficult to run, either. I sometimes
have players trying to set up ricochet shots using internal sensors,etc.
Anything rather than face a stand-up gunfight.

Guns, after all, are dangerous.

But only in the wrong hands (ie everyone else\'s)

Hope this might be some use:

I\'d argue that 6g is the most that can be *compensated* due to the needs to

I think most of the Atlantic Fleet Marines ended up in the Gulf, with the

Heh.  Last month when my wife and I were driving home from San Diego, we
passed through Pendelton.. I was driving when she asked me what the
vehicles at the side of the road were.  She was so thrilled to fibnally see
a real-life LAV-25, since her T2K character had driven one for years.  We
pulled over at the rest stop, approached the Marines, explained the
situation, and she got a nice tour of the vehicle and some great pictures.

Nice group of guys, for jarheads...

They probably don\'t do much walking.  I\'ve always cribbed Larry Niven\'s
travel chairs, little one man grav vehicles that keep light gravity folks
healthy on high-G worlds.

Someone who was born on Zila, of Zilanese parents, might well develop some
serious health problems if he spent a long period of time trying to live
under a higher gravity than he\'s used to.  The most obvious is heart
problems, since you\'ve just increased the level of work needed by a factor
of four.

IMTU, ships slowly adjust their internal fields to match the destination
world.  When the PC\'s land on Zila, the floor field should be set at .272G.
 On the way to the next palnet, they\'ll slowly turn the field up.  This is
a sneaky way of acclimating.  You can pull the same trick with atmospheric
pressure.

>Do the PC\'s look like supermen compared to the Zilan citizens when they
>are on planet?

Possibly, although Strength 12 is strength 12 where ever you go.  One
possibilty is that the Zilanese have developed some form of martial art
that takes advantage of the low gravity.

(Sudden image of a Jackie Chan movie made in .272G.. that would be fun!)

>Somebody get my head in the right place for this, please!

Think of how the astronauts looked on the moon.. that\'s a pretty good guide.

The target struck directly by the shell takes Damage 21.  There is also an
explosive effect of damage 16 that hits everything around the impact.

Example.  I fire a LAW at a T-72.  The weapon hits the T-72 with Damage 23
vs. whatever armor it has.  The infantry standing near the tank are hit
with the Damage 16 explosive balst.  (Remember to reduce damage for range,
being close to an explosion is a bad thing, but they drop off quickly.)

Firing a kinetic penetrator, the weapon does D. 20.  Firing a High
Explosive, Armor Piercing round, it does D. 25.. of course, there are
special armors to defeat HEAP rounds.

First is a direct fire AP round.  Second is a plain HE round with no
penetrator.

First is a kinetic pentrator with no HE component, second is a much more
effective round.

Most of the National Guard had been mobilized and was overseas.  The units

The target list for the Twilight War is over 300 sites that were
sucessfully struck in the United States alone.  Communications,
transportation nexi, major population centers.. all gone.

Go to you local supermarket, and only purchase food that was grown with 50
miles of you home.  Get around you house/apartment at night with no
lighting.  Look up what untreated tetanus, cholera, and flu do to
populations.  Call your local sanitation department and find out who much
solid human waste they process every day.

This will tell you what America was like in 2000.  The cities were empty,
because there was no food.  In the country, farmers were shooting refugees,
or just enslaving them to work the land, since there was no fuel for the
combines.  Fallout from the misslefield strikes led to a epidemics as
peoples immune systems failed.  There weren\'t enough people to bury all the
bodies!

The US war machine was the *only thing still working*.  The troops in
Europe and Asia juist kept fighting.  This is one of the most horrible
things, IMHO, the governments died and the troops keep following the last
orders they had recieved.

Evacuated??  ROTFLMAO!!!!!

Try this.  I live in San Francisco.  Population 745,000.  We have two (2)
freeways out of the city.  They are clogged every rush hour.  We also have
two (2) bridges.  Ditto.  We are surronded by tragets.  WHERE ARE WE GOING
TO GO?

If you evacuate the target areas, who\'s going to work in the factories?
BTW: I would love to hear where you get this "years of stockpiled
materials" idea.  The Colt people buy only what they need to fill the
orders they have.  They don\'t keep mounds of weapon-grade sheet steel lying
around, that would be a waste.  Ditto for the GM plant that builds M-1s..
since the production run is over, they have no need to stockpile material
they may never use.

Star Wars has never been deployed.  Also, in T2K, it was not deployed.  In
discussing the game,please keep to the relvant facts. The US and Russia had
a strategic nuclear exchange.

The SS-N-21 has a CEP of a bout 250m.  Big deal, since it carries 6 50kt
warheads.  I never said that every missile hit.. in fact, New York suffered
a near miss (Armies of the Night).

You seem to have an unbelievably naive view of what total war is.  The USAF
wan\'t home.  It was gone.  It\'s fields glowing softly in the night. What
few planes were left didn\'t have fuel.  So who in the hell is going to bomb
Mexico?  Unless you somehow think that B-1\'s can burn raw crude oil.

Yeah, and the French spent 20 years preparing for the next war with
Germany.  1918-1939.  Spent every effort to make sure that every possible
contingency was covered, every paln anticipated.  

Germany overran France in a little under two months.

Once again, the military survived, but the bulk of the US forces were out
side the country when the nukes flew.  Also, NBC training is a joke.  "put
your ass to the blast" indeed.  I suppose you think "duck and cover" is a
viable civil defence doctrine also.

The US can\'t be caught of guard?  December 7th, 1941.  The US Navy had sunk
a midget submarine, spotted multiple unidentified plames on radar, and
recieved a warning that an attack was possible.  Yet at dawn we slept.

A great deal.  GDW was best known as a wargame designer before Traveller,
and the design team made sure that the scenario was palusible.

Yep.  The support of Germany was not universal.  The US and UK went into
the fray, while France withdrew from the alliance and declared neutrality.
This was not a Soviet war of aggression, this was an attack to re-integrate
Germany (1st Edition) or too annex Silesia (@nd edition).  The Russians
were also involved in a major land war with China at the time, so they
could be bothered to waste time on a nation that had declared it wasn\'t
involved.

The Mediterranean fleet was decorating the bottom of the Bosporus, along
with elements of the Sixth US.

Your synopsis of Virus is basically correct.  I would just add that it was
supposed to be a TL17 construct, which was rationalized to explain why it
got in all the computers of all the races.  Personally, Nah! :)

True, the T:TNE Virus was a silicon lifeform, which is why _so_ many people
were against it.  The whole point of the Stempel architecture is that the
computers of Traveller are _not_ the architecture that we all know today,
so there can be no "technical" explanations about why it couldn\'t exist.

It is just a way of looking at the universe that leaves some awe and
imagination left to the game.  We are extrapolating whole tech levels in a
game that is getting more and more pseudo-science, when in _fact_ of science
and tech as we know it today, if we _really_ knew what the next tech level
had in store for us, we would be at that tech level.

I had prepared the two TSS articles in advance, and the more I have thought
about it, the more I realized that a better grounding in what it is that we
are trying to capture is needed:  Stempel architecture.  If we don\'t over-
define the technology, we can have a more consistent and playable game.

I guess one of the things I should have said in my write-up was that given
the "facts" of the Universe as presented, yeah you are right--Virus is pretty
unjustifiable.  Of course a lot of throw-away lines would have to be done
away with to make Virus tolerable.  As a Sci-Fi concept, it was a valid
"plot device."  Those who over techie analyze it can pick it apart.  They
can\'t pick apart Stempel, simply because it is not overdefined.


Thanks for your interest.

While I\'ve been critical in the past of some of the less savoury Task 
Wars, your proposed solution works, and above all, is an elegant fix.

The idea of rolling once per year for older/basic character types is 
pretty basic, but the Enlistment Roll tie-in is a great leap.  If the 
math works out (and I have little doubt of this, as there are those on 
the list who number-crunch with a passion, so I\'ll get out of their way), 
it solves the problem of all characters having a vanilla fix applied 
across-board.


Once again, excellent job.

Out of curiousity, how does this impact basic Scouts?  Compared to 
advanced generation, 2/year seems pretty strong.  Roll twice?  Roll once 
and the Heck with the old ways?

Ideas, comments anyone?

Uhhh remember DC, and likely a large part of the economic and political
infrastructure are gone at this point. MacAurthur was insubordinate at a
time when _everyone_ was in place. This is a period of total chaos.
Remember, this is after a \'limited nuclear exchange\':

T2k 2nd ed. P 12:

 "Throughout October the exchanges continue, escalaing
gradually. Fearful of a general strategic exchange, neither side targets
the land based ICBMs of the other, or launches so many warheads at once as
to risk convincing the other side that an all-out attack is in progress.
Neither side wishes to cross the threshold to nuclear oblivion in one bold
step, so they inch across it, never quite knowing they have done so until
after the fact.

	First military targets are hit (including the first decapitating
strikes at US targets) {note, don\'t tell me DC isn\'t one of those! Bruce}.
Then industrial targets clearly vital to the war effort, followed by
economic targets of military importance."

Later:

	"The civilian political command structure is first decimated, then
eliminated (almost by accident in some cases)"

And hazy it is...

Not from POLAND they aint! Remember we\'re tied up in WWIII right now, and
all those troops are kinda busy elsewhere.

I think you\'re trying to argue this from the standpoint of today, where we
have a large standing army, in residence, plus national guard, plus a
functioning economy, and physical and electronic infrastructure.

At this point in the T2k timeline, there really _isn\'t_ a United
States...there\'s a whole bunch of little isolated communities and mini
states trying to stay alive...the national identity be hanged.

Americans come together in the face of a threat, to be sure, but _only_
when their own backyards are in order. As of this point in the timeline, I
would wager that 30-40% of the US population has been killed, and the rest
are trying to become farmers, so they can eat, because, oddly enough, the
trucks that supply the local grocery store don\'t come by anymore.

THAT\'S the context in which we have the civil war described in the game.

   The bottom line is that the Russians are holding on to Mir much the
same way that a man will hold on to his prized \'79 Triumph TR-7--the
wiring is shot, the engine leaks oil, and the transmission practically
lacks 2nd gear, but by God it\'s a nifty sportcar and no one is going to
take my manhood...err I mean car away!

   The Russians have very few things to be proud of these days, and Mir
is one of the last.  If the Russians have to spend their ruble keeping
it together, they probably will.

   As for the American vaporware (aka the International Space Station),
it only proves a point: if you want people to explore, tell them there
is money in it.

   Columbus sailed west because there was money in it.

   Magellan sailed around the world (or at least died trying) because
there was money in it.

   Even Cousteau was able to go on his "scientific" explorations because
his sponors saw money in it.

   Until there is money to be made from space exploration, the most
you\'re going to see from it is the occasional penis showing contest
between national governments, demonstrating who is more potent than who.

   Apollo wasn\'t just a rocket program, it was a three stage phallus
symbol.

   Up until the Challenger blew up, the US has had _NO_ casualties
actually in a mission.

   The three astronauts mentioned above were manning the Apollo 1
command capsule in a dress rehearsal. A fuel cell shorted against the
titanium structure of the capsule, which quickly caught fire in the pure
O2 environment (and anybody who knows anything about titanium fires should
shudder at this point) and the capsule was gutted inside of 30 seconds.
One of the astronauts had the presence of mind to _almost_ get the hatch
open...

   BTW, this incident is the reason O2 is mixed with helium in current
american spacecraft life support systems.

   The USSR, otoh, has had numerous casualties after liftoff and during
reentry. Some of you may recall that the USSR recovered their capsules on
land.

1) I agree completely with your reasoning;
2) Doesn\'t the same necessarily apply to every other Ancient-relocated
human (sub)species?  Wouldn\'t the Geonee, Suerrat, Darrian, Zhodani et al.
immune systems had to have been similarly degenerated?

The artwork was too \'Paranoia\'.

Yet it was such a great setting, (implemented poorly like you say) that it
was a pity folks didn\'t like it. My own combat system (which grew out of
frustration with the CT system, ironically) is fast and dirty. And it
allows for recoil.

Any given clan has a number of names, all of which share the first two
phonetic elements?  What\'s the significance of the variation?  What\'s the
significance of those first two "sounds"?

(Or do you mean that all clan names start with one of two sounds? Or the
first two phonemes of *all* clan names are the same?)

I have to say I dislike this idea -- I much preferred the description of
Aslan society being fundamentally patriarchal and paternalistic, with the
female-run "corporations" borrowing the model of the patriarchal clan and
using bonds of fictive kinship to link their personnel.

Under what circumstances would a clan afford more internal political power
to females, and why would its members change its name to formally recognize
this fact?  Your proposal doesn\'t sound implausible, but it does beg for an
explanation.

My original view of Jump was formed when I first started playing this game in the LBB
days. Since I started on this list a little over 6 months ago i\'ve read all of the
articles concerning Jump. Some have added to my vision, others I\'ve plain ignored. If
the list doesn\'t mind.. (well since nobody shouted to stop I guess you don\'t ;), I\'d
like to throw out my view. Again this is a 20 year old view and doesn\'t fit all, or
even most of the current view.

When I formed my view there was no talk of Jump bubbles filled with hydrogen from
grids. The extra fuel was just a way to "supercharge" the power plant to create
enough energy to rip open a hole into Jump space. That was why ships like the Annic
Nova (I heard those groans!) worked as well as drop tanks/capacitors (which came
later). Admittedly the fuel usage was a grossly high percentage for just the
operation of supercharging the PP, we explained that away as "slop", in order to
"burn" the needed amount of fuel, you threw much more than was needed through the
power plant.

With this in mind and the 100 diameter limit due to gravitational effects, it became
assumed that the Jump Drive was based on gravity, something like creating a small
black hole with all that energy. (Remember please this was back when there was a lot
of talk about black holes). So any major gravity field had some impingement into jump
space, to a greater or lesser degree.

Now we\'re getting to where I\'m going. When a jump course was plotted it was plotted
to avoid Known gravitational fields, routes "through" a solar system had to avoid
gravity fields, planets, moons etc. by the same 100 dia. needed to initiate a jump. A
jump had to avoid the star of the starting system, in other words you couldn\'t jump
"through" the star of the start system to reach a system in that direction, you had
to move to a point in space 100 dia. away from any gravity source AND with a
projected straight line to the target system that didn\'t intersect the 100 dia. limit
of any other gravity field. This made for a LOT more insystem maneuvering and course
plotting. Most jumps were made from points above and below the star system, (FASA
later made this part of Battletech, I believe because it was so widely accepted in
those early days). Close planet, in system jumps, were VERY hard and VERY risky, used
only in emergencies.

With all of this said, I support the position that Gravity wells should have an
effect in Jump space. The idea of having navigational hazards, even in Jump, has a
lot of appeal, particularly in the M:0 period where they will be mostly unknown.
These hazards have always been part of my games with their location and mapping a
primary job for the Scouts, and the lack of good maps and charts being a real pain
for my players (not to mention those charts can COST if they have a little too much
pocket money for my taste!). I\'ve used a black dwarf  to "pull" a ship out of jump
early for one adventure, they spent a Long Time figuring out how to refuel for a
second jump, lucky for them the dwarf had also captured a rogue asteroid but they
still had to build a still from parts of their ship ;).

Anyway this is all just my opinion but I really favor a Jump system that includes
navigational hazards.

These sort of dohickies are usually pretty complex.  Examples include
the ex-Kirov\'s Nuclear & Boiler superheat plant and the ICR gas turbine.
The SAGT (Steam augmented gas turbine) is another complex plant.  All
have
higher effciencies but at questionable price efficiency and
engineerability.


I think you could also argue that a mere 6G\'s isn\'t enough to form
superdense matter, so higher grav focusiong capabilities must be
available
from its TL onward.  Grav focusing may generate local fields that drop
off
precipitously.

There have been higher efficiency systems proposed, one using deuteron
ions in magnetically contstrained arcs with effective temps of 1,000,000
K.
The energy extraction method seemed to be radiative in nature,
harnessing
the x and gamma raysthose deuterons would produce.  

Reference was a scientific encyclopedia, possibly McGraw Hill (sp?)

	What difference would it make if a Patriot hit a SCUD? SCUDs are ballistic
- -- once you\'ve launched one, it\'s got to come down somewhere. If the
Patriot hit one, it would just deflect it to a new landing point; and since
the SCUDs were magnificently inaccurate, the chances are that deflecting
the damn thing could be more dangerous than leaving it alone.

This is contradictory.  In order to "open a hole into jump space" and
then physically pass through that "hole", jump space and normal space
*must* be connected at some point (just as 2D space and 3D space are
linked together).  In addition, a ship travelling in jump space must
use normal space physics to separate itself from jump space, since a
jump drive is a physical device built using normal space physics.

Interesting twist :)  Unfortunately, Traveller canon still lets you
attempt to jump inside 100 diameters-- sometimes *well* within that
limit.

I\'d put the 30mm machine-guns in the "maniac" category!  After all,
the A-10 packs a 30mm cannon that can pierce tank armour :)

I\'d also put plasma weapons in with the "major risk" weapons since
much of the damage code of these weapons is in the form of heat and
\'plasma splash\'.

Change "heavy explosives" to "tapped/shaped charges" and that\'s it!

Hum, well, I don\'t love what the Shuttle was turned into, but I *do*
support inexpensive and reusable, so we need to get back more than just the
crew.  The engines are the really expensive hardware part of any liquid
fueled rocket, so you don\'t want to leave them up there where they won\'t do
any good.  So, what needs to de-orbit for reuse are the engine, the
controls for the engines, the crew, and enough of the framework to hold all
of it together, and in reality that means..more or less..the whole thing.

What *could* be left up there (given the shuttle system) is the external
tank.  Yes, boosting it on up would cut cargo by a small fraction, but it
would give you a very large airtight structure in orbit on every launch. 
There are a number of solid plans on how to refurbish those tanks, link
them together, install work and living spaces in them, and generally *grow*
a space presence in LEO.

The problem with our space transportation strategy is that we tried to
build ONE vehicle to do everything.  (Reminds me of McNamara\'s F111 fiasco,
don\'t get me wrong the F111 is a fine light bomber, but it was originally
conceived as being the *only* fighter/bomber in our fleet...that just
didn\'t work) 

IMO, what we need to do to open up space...

On the Hardware side, we need 4 *different* vehicles specialized for
different tasks, and a number of interlocking control, workspace, cargo,
and living modules:

 1.  A heavy lifter (tractor/trailer model) to put up very large modules
    that can be easily broken up.  Things like fission reactors and
    shielded core modules for a station and manned exploration vehicles.
    It doesn\'t have to be manned, but its expensive engines (and pumps,
    and control modules) should be detachable so they can be recovered
    and reused.  (30 years ago this would have been the Saturn, today
    we\'d have to develop it, but the Russians *do* have a heavy lift
    capability available for use while something better is developed)
    
 2.  A medium lifter (delivery van model) to put up smaller modules and
    bulk supplies.  A shuttle sized vehicle *without* multi-week
    endurance is what I\'m talking about here.  Its payload bay should be
    designed to recover the recoverable portions of the heavy lifter.
    Again it doesn\'t even have to be manned, for flexibility I\'d give
    it a small crew, but it should be completely reusable.  Maybe not
    SSTO, but that\'s the long term goal.  (The shuttle fits this
    role..poorly, but it does fit it..so do several of the stacked
    rockets as a current capability while we refit/redesign a more
    rational reuseable system.
    
 3.  A light lifter (passenger van model) to put up personnel and small
    special payloads, and make emergency runs to LEO.  Built small and
    light, able to get setup and up with a minimum of time or support
    structure.  SSTO is again a goal, but several two stage atmospheric
    lift and launch systems have been proposed and could be built
    inexpensively.  Nothing we have really does this, but a number of
    proposed designs, including "Dark Horse" could handle this role.

4.  A space tug designed specifically to move structures around in
   space.  Stick them on the back of workspace, cargo, and or living
   modules and boost them from LEO to HEO, GEO or the Moon/Mars for that
   matter.  Use fission reactors to power ion, mass driver or simply as
   thrust assists to H/O engines.  NERVA is still sitting in storage
   somewhere isn\'t it?  After 30 years we *should* be able to build
   something like it lighter, cheaper, more powerful.
    
We also need to develop workspace, cargo, power and living modules that
link together. The lego approach.  ;-)  Skylab, Mir and dozens of paper
designs already exist as models for them.

I\'m sorry to say that the only nation that has the money and technology to
actually do this is the US, and we don\'t have the cultural or political
will to do it on our own..not today.  However, there *might* still be a way
if several of the space-faring (and want to be
space-faring) nations would work together.

The current capabilities of the US, ESA, RSA..as well as Canada, Japan, etc
could provide what is needed to BUILD ONTO MIR to develop a multi-nation
space station.  They could also begin to put the infrastructure up needed
to put a multi-nation base on the moon.

While we are jointly building up a presence around MIR we could be
developing the needed vehicles and modules by dividing up the work:

1.  All three of the earth to orbit (ETO) lifters could use the same
    engines.  The medium and heavy lifters would gang several together
    to increase lift.  This means the engines, pumps and controls could
    be standardized and (sort of) mass produced.  This would lower
    building and use costs.  With the US, ESA, Russia and Japan dividing
    up the work the various parts could be built without breaking
    anyone\'s budget.
    
2.  The space tug\'s nuclear engine is probably sitting in a warehouse in
    either the US or Russia right now, and if it isn\'t either of us
    could build it in short order.  The same can be said for the nuclear
    power module.

3.  The workspace, and living modules are lower expense items and Skylab
    and Mir provide excellent models for them already.  Countries with
    less *lift* capacity/experience could be tasked with building them.
    This gives Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, China, India, etc
    *real* participation and access to space.
    
Could we do it?  Yes, we could! 

Is it likely?  No, it isn\'t, especially if we leave it to the current set
of politicians and bureaucrats that run things.  I still think it could
happen, if *we* make it happen.

	What you say is true only in the world of the theoretical 
economist.  And the macro models of theoretical economists that 
are en vogue right now don\'t work particularly well.  The Federal 
Reserve still believes in wage-push inflation, that\'s why they 
still use unemployment as an important inflation indicator.  Given its 
totally empirical focus and excellent record, I\'d believe the Fed on such 
matters.
	As for profit maximization and extensive rationality, remember 
that these are theoretically convenient assumptions rather than empirically 
accurate descriptions.

	Someone else asked this recently and I think that most speculative
trade is conducted by import-export companies that ship goods as 
freight on the big haulers.  Free Traders exist in the smallest of niches 
where their newer information and ability to serve very small markets 
allows them to survive.  They are by no means the main-stays of trade in 
the Imperium.
	Historically there were ships that operated as something like 
Free Traders, but they relied on unorganized buyers and sellers on both 
ends and significant transactional hazards.  With both ends of the 
transaction under the Imperial legal and financial umbrella, arranging 
trades directly without the middle-man of the Free Trader shouldn\'t be 
too difficult.
	We could imagine commercial information going out on the X-boats
or X-Web, also.  So an operation on a backwater world could use a search
program on the subsector yellow pages to find someone to sell him several
tons of foogle-blasters in odd sizes.  He\'d place an order into the mail,
to be picked up by the next mail ship, along with an encoded
funds-transfer order to be executed when a valid bill-of-lading was 
presented to the bank by the company he\'s ordering from.  If there was 
some problem with the delivery, he might have to travel off-world to 
solve the legal problem, but the uniform Imperial laws would be known to 
him and well equipped to handle the situation.  Still, the trouble and 
expense of such arrangements means that only companies that rely on 
off-world supplies or markets for frequent transactions will bother to 
set them up.  Other firms will rely on importer-exporters.  On the 
frontiers and in back waters, Subsidized Merchants probably provide the 
continuity to hold this system together.  
	All this means Free Traders try to survive by filling the cracks
in this system or going where regular trade and communication do not
exist.

Andrew, there were a number of us calling for Skylab to be boosted to a
higher orbit for years, before it came down.  It was in "no immediate
danger of de-orbiting", said the *experts* at NASA, so nothing was done. It
*could* have been boosted, it should have been boosted, and it should have
been done *years* before the flare and it became too late.

The *real* problem is that those with the power to *do* anything don\'t care
one whit about man\'s expansion into space!  For them it\'s all about funding
programs and keeping their jobs.  If Congress cuts a program back what do
they care as long as they can get some other program funded so they stay
employed.  It\'s the bureaucratic mentality in the leadership positions that
is killing us. 

I *wish* turning the development of space over to private enterprise would
turn things around, but I\'m afraid big-business has become as bureaucractic
as the government.

I believe the Soviet space program casualty list total is four
(officially, anyways).  The Soviet navy has a fleet of satellite
communication vessels named after dead cosmonauts so I guess it all
depends on your definition of the word "fleet".

And I can\'t stand the fact that the UK is *ignored* through most of 2300\'s
material, but that doesn\'t stop me appreciating the game as having a great
and different feel to anything else that\'s around. Why should the US be the
dominant power in three hundred years?  The 1WW and 2WW broke the UK\'s
economic and military dominance of the world. 	Why shouldn\'t the 3WW in
the T2000 and T2300 timeline break the US. I accept that you don\'t like it,
but that doesn\'t invalidate the timeline of the game which presents a
different and interesting place in which to entertain your players.

However, if you don\'t like it, you don\'t play it - like me and TNE! ;-)

Ahem. Bearing in mind that this all relates to 2300...

What about the French SSBNs? And they do have a couple of nice carriers...
So that is 3 sets of nukes stopping US global domination. And somehow, I
think that the French Government would have less of a resistance to using
them than the UK, as they don\'t have the same cultural heritage.

Obs: In the BBC series \'Yes minister" it was commented that the UK nuclear
deterent existed because of the \'real\' enemy. Not the Soviets, but the
French! ;-)

You\'d be surprised ;)  Actually, what is holding back the IC engine is
not any inherent design "thingies", but the demands of the people that
use them (who needs to go from 0-60 mph in under 5 seconds just to
pick up the kids from daycare).  Gas economy and emissions are also
major factors :)

I believe the reason why the Shuttle is so large is because the
military demanded that it be built that way.  If NASA had had their
way, it would have been about half that size.  The Soviets copied the
Shuttle virtually "bolt-for-bolt" (and who says that isn\'t flattery :)
but it never made it past the piggy-back tests.  The EU (French?) have
a much smaller shuttle design in the works, as do the Japanese, IIRC.

Hmm... Lets start with the Imperial Encyclopedia...
<quote>
Express Boats: Rapid communication ships designed to make optimum use of
jump technology in communicating information within the Imperium. Because
the Imperium is so large, ordinary communication must depend on ships
travelling along established trade routes, making Regina nearly 4 years out
from the Imperial Core. The express boat (abbreviated Xboat) system,
established originally in 624 and expanded to cover the entire imperium by
718, reduces this communication time by nearly 75 percent.

Selected locations along major trade routes are established as sites for
express stations, which are orbital facilities which service and refuel the
Xboats on their communications runs. As an Xboat arrives in a system, it
beams its recorded data to the express station, which then retransmits it
to an Xboat standing by for a jump outsystem; Time between jumps is almost
always less than four hours and has been recorded at under seven minutes
making the speed of communication nearly the speed of jump (since Xboats
carry jump-4 drives, speeds near four parsecs per week). In practice, this
speed is somewhat reduced by the fact that trade routes do not follow
straight lines and that not all jumps are made at jump-4. Nonetheless, the
system achieves approximately jump-2.6 per week.
</quote>

Now, Traders and Gunboats (S7) describes a jump 4 X boat.

One of the other CT supplements (FFW?) mentions the experimental deployment
of drop tanked J6 (?) Xboats to half the journey time..

Another (Twilights Peak) mentions a rerouting of the Xboat link to improve
communications to Regina (but this doesn\'t happen by MT).

MT describes a J4 network with separate J6 naval and imperial couriers.

I think the sources you are refering to are TNE with the upgrade of the
Xboat net to the Xweb??

one I mentioned. The .44 Desert Eagle was a tiny cousin comeared to some -
I remember a mention of a scope rated for .44 Magnum becoming banana shaped
due to recoil and some photos of the editor with blood running down her
face from where one of the guns had leaped up and bit her forehead with its
foresight. She normally shoots a .44, they said, and just wasn\'t ready for
this beast (!!!!!). She did, however, finish the tests, which makes her a
better man than me!

Unfortunately, I just can\'t remember the magazine - this feature stuck in

And Bill Gates (images of high c rocks dancing in my head...) has enough 
money to fund his own SSTO development program with pocket change.  His 
idea of \'man\'s expansion into space\' stops just the other side of Teledesic.

Wouldn\'t it be great though if Bill funded Boeing\'s development of the

a spacecraft that develops GPF\'s when you tell it to extend the landing gear.

The T-90 is a myth.  Also known as the FST-1, it was the product of the
CIS\'a worst case scenario.  The T-80 is the best the Soviets ever had, it
even that tank is kind of weak.

> `What are the names of the 29 in about 100 Imperial?

As a baseline, here are some notes from DGP\'s "Solomani & Aslan".  Page 55
states "of the original 29 clans which formed the Tlaukhu, 19 clans are
still members of that body."  CT\'s Alien Module 1 confirms that (p. 5),
and adds that multiple clans have occupied the ten changing positions.

From what I can tell from this figure and the written history, that means
the original (or at least pre-100) members definitely comprise clans:
Yerlyaruiwo, Khaukheairl, Syoisuis, Tralyeaeawi, Eakhtiyo.

Clan Hrawoao was one of the four major groups engaged in the Aslan Border
Wars, and signed the Peace of Ftahalr in 380.  That\'s the first time I see
it mentioned, though they must have existed for some time to be one of the
major clans.

Uiktawa, Ftawsteaoihalr, Hweolriya, Iykhyasea, and Faowaou hold extensive
presence in the rimward Hierate.  Their age is not specified.  Aokhalte
holds part of the central Hierate, and may be of some antiquity (they,
along with Sahao\' and Ouokhoi, are desperately overpopulated for their
existing worlds by the CT era).  Clans Seieakh, Akatoiloh, and We\'okurir
hold worlds far from the bulk of the Hierate, and are thus likely of
recent origin.

Two specific transitions are listed:

Hlyueawi -- replaced the Uawairlew in 652 Imperial
Ikhtealyo -- vaulted into the Tlaukhu on the strength of the dustspice
	trade and trans-Rift expansion in 380 Imperial.  The clan they
	replaced is not listed.

It\'s possible because the gravitational interaction goes both ways; if the
ship interacts with the "natural gravity of N-space objects", then those
objects interact with the ship.

Imagine a matrix of gravitic detectors, each side hundreds of kilometers
across, in deep space between two systems with heavy jump-traffic. As ships
zip by following their N-space courses the matrix is infuenced by their
infintesimal gravity the same way "natural gravity" influences the ships.
Analyzing the speed and direction of the influences will tell the jump
number and N-space course of the ship. This gives you a pretty good idea of
their origin and destination. If gravitational effects can precipitate a
ship from jump, or destroy it if large enough, you can attack ships in jump
using a large enough artificial gravitational field. Since J-space is
2-dimensional, it is possible to construct a gravitational "fence" in
J-space.

Put a gravitic device on board the ship which emits a modulated gravity
pulse. The matrix can detect these modulations and decode them as the ship
passes through while in jump. Now ships in jump can send messages. Then put
a gravitic sensor on the ship and scatter specially encoded gravitic
emitters throughout the matrix. The ship can detect the emitters and decode
them as it passes through the matrix. Now you can communicate with ships in
jump. If you can carry out electronic warfare (jamming, hacking, data
piracy) in the fraction of a second the ship passes through the matrix, you
can do so while the ship is in jump.

If you can \'plot\' jump courses to avoid N-space objects, and there is a
mapping between N-space and J-space, then you change your J-space course as
well. If you can do this, you can match your J-space course with that of
another ship in jump. Both ships in jump can use the gravitic devices to
create gravitational effects in their corresponding N-space location, and
therefore communicate with each other. If the ships travel at the same jump
speed they can communicate the entire time they are in jump.

These effects are completely antithetical to the background of Traveller.
They are the main reason I dislike the idea of ships in jump having to
follow N-space courses.

Another reason I dislike the "N-space course" idea is that N-space is
3-dimensional while J-space is 2-dimensional. Even if we assume the ship
follows some kind of 2D to 3D mapping in N-space, it seems unlikely that
course would be a simple straight line in N-space.

Any truth to a TML posting six months or so ago stating that they were
for anti-terrorist or anti-boarding party use?  (The troops using the
shotguns would storm a room and the rest of the crew were trained to
hit the deck at the same time.  The only ones left standing were the
bad guys, who became easy targets.)

FWIW, I did not right the above paragraph; Glenn Crawford did.  His

We did a great deal. Considering the time and the place (we designed the game
in the early 1980s) I think we came up with a consistent and fairly
reasonable sequence of events that took us to where we needed the game to go.
We wanted to come up with a scenario more unusual and interesting than the
standard "Commies through the Fulda Gap" WWIII scenario, and we succeeded
very nicely, I think. 

Have you read the Twilight: 2000 background (as presented in the basic rules
book and in the sourcebook _Howling Wilderness_)? The scenario is explained
in a great deal more detail than has been presented here, and covers a number
of your objections.

That would do me the most good personally.   My campain runs in the Spinward Marches,
post 5th FW.  No Rebellion, no Virus.  This should be a GURPS:Traveller
early edition.  Perhaps two seperate books.  The Vargr really deserve their
own book in a Spinward Marches campain setting.  Other good books for that
region would be the dedicated Zhodani book, and the Darrian/Sword Worlds book.

  Another book on my wish list is FF&S: The Return of Gearheads .  This is
the manual that covers some ot the vital stuff that the first one missed.
"Wet" ship design, robots, primitive transport & genetic engineering are
the topics that leap to mind.  A good add on would be "liftwood" rules for
"wet" ship design and Ether Proppeller rules.   That should please the pith
helmet crowd with only a page or two.  Just how is that GURPS:SPACE:1889
push coming along :-)

  Now on to Journal articles I\'d like to see...

   Imperial uniform designs.  This has been covered in sources before, but
could use a recap in an offical publication.  M0 and G:T books for this.

   Critters.  A few pages on some basic animals.  Herd animals, work
beasts, luxury pets, riding animals, etc.  A good spot for an artist with
sketchpad full of animal beasts to provide colour to the article.

  Standards for non-Imperial governments.  A page or two on their standards
can put the Gearhead squad to work churning out some basic equipment.  For
example, the standard Solmani Marine issue Gauss Rifle in use between years
X & Y, fired a XxYmm round and mounted a XXmm grenade Launcher.  The
Zhodani issue side armed fired a fu round and used magazines of bar
capacity.

I think we all believe... that\'s why we play Traveller!

I had an arguement with a non-sci-fi friend the other day, she was saying
that we should not increase any space programs because of the amount of
damage that rocket launches do to the ozone layer.

I tried o tell her that any damage is minimal compared to other industries,
and the returns were worth it.... but I didn\'t come out as convincing enough!

But this is part of the attitude which is going to limit space exploration
in the future.

There goes my ambition to go hang gliding on Mars!

I like this idea. It gives some variety to the Aslan and makes them not so
steriotypical.

From a dramatic perspective you have to throw a curveball to your players
once in a while, and a more female-oriented clan could do this. From a
realism standpoint I find it hard to believe the Alsan are so conformist
that they have never had any female-dominated clans. "Fundamentally
patriarchical" does not mean exclusively patriarchical. Consider all the
weird government types and social communities that have existed on Earth. I
can\'t believe that the billions of Aslan are all in utterly conventional
social groups.

If I could make one suggestion for new material on the Alsan, it would be
to play up their individualism and the mercantile aspects of their society.
This would add depth to Aslan society and make them seem less like
"Klingons in fur".

this IMHO is more probable , none of the different factions wants to lose

U.S. [ for the past couple hundred years anyway ] soil . maybe the
factions go back at each other after they deal with the invaders , thats
a whole different scenario .

also the U.S. army stock piles parts and fuel enough for years of war . I
know because I have seen these ware houses before . also in time of dire
need [ such as an invasion of U.S. soil ] every american would be
expected to fight , and most of us possess fire arms not to mention the
militias and other para military groups that would fight a guerilla war
against the invaders .

I would fight . would you Mr. Berry ? this last question is to show that
americans have not lost thier will and we could defeat and hold off any
nation attempting to invade as well as project enough power to send said
invading power straight back to the stone age . in addition to american
tech. superiority don\'t short change the american peoples fighting spirit
.. especealy when defending thier homes ,

also I should not compare the 80\'s T2000 background with 90\'s tech and
military forces . short and simple the U.S. would most probably not bog
down in a ground war as our air superiority would sweep the enemy from
the sky , our combined arms would crush any resistance on the ground and
our navy would keep the sea clear for continued supply and troop movement
.. our arms and ammo factories would be moved to hidden and hard to target
areas and the populace would be put to work as well as on food and fuel
rations . even with this adversity I am sure the U.S. would not slip
behind any other nation on this mud ball and would reach pre war levels
quickly after the war . this nation has been planning for nuclear war for
decades and I am confident we could get through it as well or better than
is depicted in the T2000 / 2300AD back grounds . on the ending note , the
majority of the worlds economic health relies on the U.S. and if the U.S.
failed so would the economies of the world .

Frederick Forsythe, the Questar 3.5" telescope (although the optical
characteristics on this thing\'s scope are different), and any number of
politicians and certain individuals who are beating off-topic dead horses
into holes in the pavement about the size of Meteor Crater in Arizona..:).

	I\'d be interested to hear what the list\'s resident sniper has to
say about this thing.


"News Item, Gauss Enthusiast\'s Weekly, 05-250

FSA releases quad-barreled Extremely Long Range Gauss Sniper Rifle.

	Today, Famille Spofulam Armaments unveiled its latest gauss rifle
offering, a quad-barreled 3.25 mm sniper rifle system designated the
"Jackal-4".  It is an unconventional-looking weapon, to say the least.  It
sports 4 60-centimeter barrels, protected by lozenge-cross-sectioned dark
gray barrel shrouds, installed in a diamond configuration around an 87.5
centimeter long f/15 175mm aperture catadioptric telescope.  An
outwards-facing bulge at the end of each barrel holds individual gyroscopic
recoil compensators.  Short 5-dart magazines protrude outwards from the
four recievers like the legs of a stubby letter "x", and the weapon,
configured with a folding shock-absorbing stock, pistolgrip, and bipod, is
entirely gyrostabilized.

	The mission of the weapon is simple; to provide extreme accuracy at
extreme ranges, and to improve chances of hitting the target from several
kilometers out by configurable-pattern multi-round bursts directed by a
telescopic computerized predictive sight.

	The heart of the weapon is the huge computerized predictive
telescopic sight, which drives four individual servo-actuated mountings,
one for each barrel.  A keypad mounted on the forestock enables the shooter
to select one of several barrel alignments, which, guided by the
computerized rangefinding sight and servo mountings, places the four
simultaneously fired darts in various patterns; close burst (all darts
aimed at the same spot), three cross patterns of varying  pre-set
tightnesses and four more user-definable cross patterns.  As well, the
weapon can also place four darts in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines
of varying spread.  The weapon can fire in both single-shot (actually,
four-shot) mode and in VRF mode (with a theoretical cyclical rate of fire
of 4500 rpm from each barrel), the latter of which will spit 20 darts at
the target, in various patterns (including expanding-cross and longer
traverse line patterns to increase chances of hitting a moving target at
extreme ranges) in a brief 0.07 second.

	This flexibility in terms of burst pattern and rate of fire, when
combined with full-weapon gyro-stabilization, 6,000 m/s muzzle velocity,
long-range sighting system, and computerized predictive aiming
capabilities, is expected to result in a highly effective precision
long-range sniper rifle.

	At the weapon\'s unveiling, conducted at the extensive testing
grounds at Famille Spofulam\'s Sylean groundside facilities, the press were
given the chance to inspect the weapon (several of which were made
available for handling) first-hand.  After its rather menacingly futuristic
styling, the second thing that strikes the observer is the rifle\'s weight;
it masses nearly 37 kilos.  However, it is designed to be transported by a
two-person team and fired resting from a bipod, which alleviates somewhat
the weight problem.  As well, the weapon\'s extreme weight helps reduce
recoil; although its darts weigh only 0.54 grams apiece; four or twenty of
them departing at 6 kilometers/second produce significant recoil.

	After initial familiarization had taken place, the weapons, set up
on range benches, were loaded by Spofulam range attendants, and several
journalists invited to test-fire them at a series of Juice Bags (Imperial
Standard Ballistic Testing Dummies) standing anywhere from 500 meters
downrange... to 5 kilometers away, on a hillside across the valley.  The
more distant ones were equipped with revolving-strobe emergency headgear
and orange coveralls in order to aid with location.

	The firing process takes place as follows; after the weapon is
powered up, the shooter aims it manually, using iron sights and a 5X finder
scope to acquire the target.  Once target is placed within the finder\'s
reticule, the weapon-platform gyrostabilization is engaged and the
computerized sight\'s binocular eyepiece deploys.  Once the target is
spotted in the computerized sight\'s field of view, the firer stares
directly at the target and blinks twice; this designates the target.  The
sight then takes over, identifying the target, highlighting it, determining
and displaying range and time to target, and slews the four barrels
precisely onto target, whose motion it is capable of tracking via it\'s
predictive function.  It then adjusts the barrel alignment to the selected
burst pattern and displays it onto the target.  At closer ranges, within
800 meters or so, on stationary targets FSA recommends a four-round close
pattern; at extreme range on moving targets, a 20-round linear burst along
the direction of travel.

	Once target acquired and burst pattern selected, the shooter then
depresses the electronic trigger.  Recoil, due to the shock-absorbing stock
and individual gyroscopic recoil compensators on each barrel, is
surprisingly light for such a high-powered weapon.  As mentioned earlier,
the bipod and heavy overall weight help with this.  Hitting targets is
ridiculously easy; selecting an ISBTD about 2 km away (which, following
Spofulam tradition, bore a suspicious resemblance to Sir Arameth Gridlore),
I chose a 12-cm separation cross pattern centered on its torso, and pulled
the trigger.  A high-pitched quadruple mini sonic boom split the air, and
after an eerie, perceptible delay of nearly a third of a second, I saw the
ISBTD jerk violently backwards.  Its mounting swung it back to a standing
position, and I saw three flourescent green splotches of ISBTD Circulatory
Fluid Analogue spreading across its chest..."*




* In order to test this, I assumed a shooter with a DEX of 8 and Rifle-3
firing under KB v.2.0., at Extremely Long range (2 km).  This gave him a
base target number of 17 for a target number of 26 with the DM figured in,
on 8d6.  Results for a 4-round burst were: 25 (hit), 25 (hit again), 27
(miss), 25 (hit).  That\'d be 27 dice worth of damage done to the target,
although there\'s a case for rolling each 9d6 damage roll separately.

T4 stats:

Name:	FSA Jackal-4 ELR-GS Gauss Sniper Rifle
Damage:	9 (9.5 HE), _per barrel_
TL: 	12
Range: 	Long (183 m)
Shots: 	5 X 4 round bursts

Reloads:6.48 kg per 4 5-round magazines
Cost: 	32,999 cr (jacked way up to reflect the weapon\'s wierdness)


	As far as using it in-game is concerned, I would simply suggest
giving it a massive positive difficulty modifier for use at ranges over
Short; in KB v.2.0 a +DM of about 9 or so would feel about right.  Other
task systems should use appropriate DM\'s.  I\'d recommend imposing a
significant negative die modifier for use at Short or shorter ranges.
Also, I would suggest rolling individually for each round fired in
single-shot mode, and applying the VRF to-hit and damage bonuses when
firing it in VRF-burst mode.

   Assuming a scenario where the US Navy is intact, the French aircraft
carriers would be lucky to make it past the Azores before being sunk. 
Assuming an intact US Navy and if surprise could be achieved, Los
Angeles-class attack submarines could sink them *in port*.  IIRC, the
French carriers would rate as light carriers in the American Navy--they
are far from being in the same class as the Nimitz (perhaps close to the
Ranger in size?), and the aircraft they carry wouldn\'t last long against
Hornets and Tomcats.

   French SSBNs are inferior to Soviet and American submarines.  I don\'t
know what their boat captains are like, but similar to the aircraft
carriers, I doubt they could get past the Azores--far from missile
range.

   I\'m getting a mental picture of what the Seawolf would do to shipping
off Brest.  Ouch....

Read a book by Dr. Jerry Pournell titled, "A Step Farther Out".  In his
book, Dr. Pournell details how to get into space cheaply and safely.  He
goes on to say how important doing that is.  He\'s done all the research,
calculated everything to the tightest details, and provides the
information and formulas for the reader to do so as well.  Nothing is
assumed.

We have 79 years left to get out into space, or we will not have the
financial and material resourves to do it.  When this happens, our
technological civilization is doomed, along with 2/3rds of the world\'s
population, which WILL die.

2-300 years after that 79 year mark, we will no longer have the
un-renewable resources in order to run our high tech society.  Without
high technology, we will not be able to feed all the world\'s population.

The time to start for space is NOW, while we still can.  If we miss this
79 year envelope, then we have doomed future generations to death.  We
have a responsibility to think for the future.

I think you did too.

What Tw2K is doing on the TML, I don\'t know, but I enjoyed (still enjoy)
the game..both versions. ;->  

I didn\'t *like* the setting...you weren\'t supposed to *like* being stuck in
WWIII and it\'s aftermath...and I didn\'t think some of the events in the
continential US were too likely, but the games that came out of Tw2K were
some of the best non-Traveller games I\'ve ever been in.  Sure you could
play them as "shoot-em-ups"..and create new characters every
session;->...but where these games stood out for me was the *roleplaying*
of people playing in what *could* very well have been their nightmare of a
future. Playing in the rubble of their hometowns. Trying to survive. Get
home. Deal with what home had become. 

Yep, Tw2K was good.

It will IMHO keep the US population occupied with other issues that

But they are not fighting openly. They are skrimishing on their borders,
and more than enough detained with feeding the population. scrounging for
supplies and so on. They are in no way equipt morally or physiacly to
prevent the invasion, again IMHO.

I think most of this stock pile has been sent overseas with the national
guard and all the other troops. Also I would suspect there not beeing
enough transportation or fuel to move any significant portion of this pile
anywhere. Remeber that only Milgov is capable of feeding the population
which now lives scattered outside the cities.

> I would fight . would you Mr. Berry ? 

I it stands between harvesting your field to give your family food on the
table and travelling to Texas to fight a battle, I think most would choose
the first one. This is the thing with nuclear strikes. They take out the
infrastructure of the nation and forces the population to become
selfsufficant. That is going to take the fighting will out of any nation.

But since most of the soldiers are overseas, the equipment not readily at
hand, the infrastructure destroyed, do the Texans really care who calls
themself rulers of the land they live on. How getting food and other
necessities is a more important question. I also seem to remeber that
Texas pulled out of the US during the civil wars, but I might be wrong.

But the air superiority is taken out with the limited nuclear strikes on
both sides. So when the Commies attack through Poland there is few
airports or fields, and even fewer ports for the ships. Also don\'t
underestimate the Soviet submarines. That is going to be a severe thorn in
the US Navys side.

How do you move them when the local infrastructure is destroyed by atomic
bombs. Moving tons of equipment when there are no roads, no gasstations
and little gasoline it gets pretty though.

In the T2000 scenario, US was the county hit hardest by both the nuclear
strikes and the ground wars all over the planet. A country where a large
portion of the young are trapped overseas is going to have a real hard
time rebuilding.

I don\'t think any government on this planet is prepared for a nuclear war.
It is just propaganda IMHO. Nuclear war would devestate to much. Loss of
most computers from the EMP is just a biginning. Can you imagine the US
without Internet and computers. :-)

I don\'t know if you are interested, but I\'ve written a few Traveller
stories myself.

If you\'d like to see two of them, you can find them on Jeff\'s Freelance
Traveller page.  You can link there from the IG link page.

Don\'t be too hard on them though.  I originally wrote them for my
players.  They are first drafts and could probably use some work in
places.

But, if you like to read Traveller, check them out and let me know what
you think.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

actually I have read numerous times including once tonight [ insomnia is
a pain ] and I must clarify some things . it seems the debate has been
dragged all over from the starting point which was my dislike of the
2300AD treatment of the U.S. 

	IN the T2000 background france was also listed as nuked by the
soviets stateing that all french ports and refineries were hit in order
to deny thier use to NATO forces . I really think that being nuked would
goad france into retaliation not to mention the french and european
economy grinding down to nothing without U.S. backing and the euros
starving with out imports from the U.S. and other nations abroad as
europe does not produce nearly enough food stuffs to feed its people .
	all of this does not stop the T2000 background from being
reasonably believable ,  unless you count the wild mexican armored
columns blitzing through texas and california [ mexico possess  no armor
of consequence at this time ] and the fact that the remainder of U.S.
forces were in texas at the time . 
	all of this did not stop me from playing the game because these
things are not important if you are some joe slogging it out in the mud
in central europe . but in the 2300AD referees must convince the players
that these events are plausible its a whole other story , have you ever
been laughed at when trying to explain to the players why thier U.S.
national could not have been born in mexico unless he were an immigrant ?
it will kill your mood to run a game in no time . If the U.S. were going
to lose the #1 rank at least they could have maintained pre war borders
or if invaded continued to fight the occupation forces , but noooo we
accept foreign occupation lose a fifth of the nation turn up a mediocre
power in the world with a laughable space program and are looked down
upon by the rest of the world . talk about getting the shaft ..
	If any nation or alliance were going to usurp the U.S. \'s
position as world leader it would be the pacific rim IMHO not france ..

maybe in the 3rd edition you guys can get it right , if there was one .

thruster-plate equipped ship, but 6g won\'t do very much for a lot of 
energy-manipulation purposes: for example, holding hydrogen plasma at 
sufficient densities to fuse, or providing \'gravitic focussing\' for laser

I suggest that Traveller technologies are able to generate much higher 
grav fields, but only for periods of milli- or micro-seconds. This means 
that you can\'t have a 2000g gravity-compensated fighter craft, but you 
can muster several thousands of Gs for a specific purpose, like focussing 
a laser pulse or pinching a plasma into fusion. 
The limitation on improving your laser focussing or fusion power 
production would probably depend on computer expertise, since a human 
being couldn\'t effectively supervise nanosecond decision processes. 
So were the old Book 4 repulsors actually devices that fire a pulse of 
gravitic energy, to smash or deflect incoming missiles?

It was their unique approach gender roles that make them unique (or
one of the things).  I you make them just another race where you
have a slightly male dominate society in which women are trying
for equal rights (just like on Earth) you loose that.

It might be that Aslan have big controversies over things they consider
crucial (but humans wonder why aren\'t just considered side issues,
like maybe whether females using artillery for direct fire
situations is permitted).  But just putting them into the same
old human gender stuggle is (IMO) more like Klingons in fur.
(After all, they have a mostly male dominated society with
some women managing positions of power too....)

describing humanoids from high-gravities. In most, the high-g humans are 
short, massively muscled specimens, because they have spent all their 
lives in a high-gravity field. 
However, the true advantage in high-g environments would go to those 
small enough that they don\'t have to spend their lives struggling against 
their own bodyweight. Natural selection would, IMHO, lead to high-g 
humanoids being short, yes, but probably quite low in mass as well. More 
blood can be directed to vital functions (brain etc) rather than being 
pumped all the way down to massive legs and all the way up again. This 
circulatory benefit alone would result in significantly reduced incidence 
of heart disorders....

However, you still wouldn\'t mess with one of these 4-foot tall 25kg dudes, 
since they could still bust you in half with their bare hands. 

Low g humans, on the other hand, would have a different set of problems. 
Large muscles would still have strength benefits, but it would be 
less difficult to carry them around. Obesity would be less of a 
disability, since fat would weigh a lot less too. 

I would expect low-g humans to appear quite plump, both because they 
couldn\'t be bothered to lose that extra flab they\'ve acquired from the 
small amount of exercise they get in their day-to-day life, and because 
of fluid retention that seems to plague persons in low-g environments (eg 
Mir). 

So let\'s have an end to the high-g \'dwarves\' and low-g \'elves\' in SF! 
They will instead be high-g \'midgets\' and low-g \'fatsos\'...!

This is how I\'m doing it.

If a skill award is given, the character gets a roll--no matter what. 
This means if he gets a skill for a promotion, he gets his roll.  If he
gets a skill for commission, he gets a roll, and so on.

In the case of the Scouts, I\'d give them two rolls per year.  This will
work out and balance them against other characters--just as they were
balanced when they got 1 skill per 4 years.

Why?  First off, the survival roll is pretty high, and this is a good
ballancer.  Second, the Enlistment throw (used for skill awards) is
fairly high too.  It\'s a 7+ as compared to the Army,which is a 5+.

Also, remember that Scouts don\'t get (in the CT/MT basic generation
system) skills for promotion or commission.  This will tend to even out
Scouts with other careers--that usually do get skills with promotion and
commission.  Don\'t forget that normal careers get two skills instead of
one if the throw for commission or promotion is 4+ than the listed
number.  Scout characters will miss out on this.

In using my chargen tweak, a player has a choice as to which Scout
career he wants to join.  He can weigh the pros and cons of the
different systems.

In CT and MT basic chargen, he gets 2 skill throws per year at the
expense of no skill for promotion or commission.  He also gets Pilot-1
automatically.

In CT and MT advanced chargen, he gets one skill throw per year (most of
the time plus a couple of skills for initial and advance
training--depending on what that training is.  This may seem like the
character will get less skills than if the player chose the above
system, but remember that the skill throw is variable under this
option.  The throw for a skill for a Scout in the Survey department
undergoing a War Mission is only 3+ vs the 7+ throw that will have to be
made using the system above.

In T4, Scout characters get 1 skill throw per year plus another skill
throw every two years, and they get Pilot-1, Exploration-1, and JOT-1
automatically.

Clearly, all three of these systems, using my tweak, will produce
compatible characters.  

As a GM, you can use different systems for different types of
characters.

For instance--

Let\'s say your player wants to roll up a Navy character.  If he uses
then CT/MT advanced methods, he gets a choice of which Navy to try for. 
Will he go for the Imperial Navy?  The subsector Navy?  A sector navy? 
A planetary Navy?

You could do something similar with the other Navy chargen systems.  You
could say that the CT/MT basic method is used for Imperial Navy
characters whereas T4 chargen characters are planetary Navy.

Or, you could just give the player a choice of systems, based on which
skills are offered in each system.  Two Scouts, generated with different
systems, have different life experiences, and thus the difference in the
characters.

For example, Perception is only offered on the T4 Scout chargen system. 
If a player wants that skill, he had better choose that method.

Then again, the GM may have the player random roll which system is used.

Or, whatever.  The bottom line here is that this tweak makes all of the
Traveller chargen systems relevant to playing with T4--and it adds a
heck of a lot of variety for character generation.

All of a sudden their is not just one way to roll up character.  There
are several choices, each with different pros and cons.

Thanks for the offer, but I\'ll find a copy of T&G one of these days. 
I\'d be glad to help you out though.

You may want to think about it before you rush into copying anything
though.  It seems like a little thing, but it can add up real quick.

The Vargr Alien Module is 51 pages.  At $0.10 per page to copy, you are
looking at $5.1 to copy the thing.  You end up with a photocopy that may
be dark and unreadable in places, and if you search, you may find the
book for a buck or two more.

And, that\'s just one book.  I have all the Alien Modules that I can copy
for you, and I have Solomani Rim and Merchant Prince.  You\'re looking at
over $50 to copy all of that.  Postage will probably cost you another
buck a book, so now you are looking at over $60.

If you do want a copy of one or all of these, I will be happy to do it
for you.  I think you\'d be better off trying to find a printed copy
though.

Let me know if you want to copy something.  We\'ll figure out the price
for copys and postage, and you can send me a check.  Then I\'ll copy the
stuff and send it to you.

I am glad to help you out if this is the route you want to go.

Kenneth.

Most of all the fun. I don\'t even use the setting, and seldom the rules.
To me Traveller is the ships, the vehicles, the weapons, the gadgets and
so on. I\'m currently running a campaign in a story teller way, dice rolls
are very infrequent. There has been evnings where there has been no use of
dice what so ever. But my players love it and enjoy themself. And no
matter what other say, we\'re still playing Traveller.

Yes, it is also an inevitabiity. At the very least none of these races would
have had helper T cells for virtually any of the millions of Terran disease
organisms. However if one assumes that most of these races developed on
worlds were the ecosystem was more compatible with Humans than on Vland (AM 5
indicates that the Zhodani were at least partially compatible with Zhodant).
Then one can assume that their were some disease organisms that could infect
humans on these worlds. However these worlds would not have had anything
like the number of human pathogens which the Terrans have faced, so their
immune systems would have also degenerated; but perhaps not to the same
degree of the Vilani, who have basically evoloved in a completely sterile
environment. However, one could also expect their immune systems to evolve
very quickly (in evolutionary terms) after contact. Disease is a *very*
effective evolutionary selection method. Plus interbreading with the Terrans
would also further strengthen the other human transplants immune systems.

Well, actually, I find it OK -- certainly better than the crap that Foss does!

If you like the general *idea* of a Hardcover/Glossy Paper version of GURPS
Traveller, but are unsure of the quality of the interior art ... then let them
know of your concerns, but push for the Hardcover/Glossy Paper version!

And they could probably get someone from the local Kindergarten who could do at

However you run it, though, Terran diseases, as represented by the supposed
worst of them, the Plague of Duskir, killed less than 1% of the population of
the Ziru Sirka.

I presume that it really doesn\'t matter whether the populace were racially
Vilani or some other minor Human race, as they *all* were cut off from the
mainstream of humanity some 300k years before, and therefore have the same lack
of T-Cell memory etc.

Ergo, *either* the Terrans *did* undertake a huge (and self-evidently vastly
successful) inoculation/antibiotic/antiviral distribution plan *or* the lessened
effectiveness of the Vilani immune system was overstated (perhaps there is some
factor here that is explainable by what we know, or by something that we will
discover in the hypothetical future).

Regardless, remember, 99% plus of Vilani and equally vulnerable minor human
races were unaffected and survived.

As for a Terran example, well, the Spanish Flu is one -- it was a completely new
disease for which none of our disease memory had any "handle" ... yet it only
managed to kill around 1.5% of the then populace before disappearing (and it
wasn\'t, so we have discovered recently by DNA typing viable specimens preserved
more or less by accident at the time, a new strain of the Flu, it was a mutant
version of Swine Flu).

According to what I have read, some diseases can be *too* lethal, and kill off
either all possible hosts too quickly (so they cannot spread) and these diseases
generally appear once (often in Africa or Asia near the huge disease/bio
reservoirs that are the rain forests) and then disappear ... and all are
basically animal diseases. Perhaps the PoD was just the same.

But 99% of the populace of the ZS did not die. So it either means that there was
a massive Terran medical effort *or* that the factors you are quite right in
describing had less effect than we would expect.

Noticeably less effective = 99% of Terran levels.

Or the Terrans spread biomedical info and resources so quickly that they quashed
most of the disease outbreaks even before they happened.

Very dramatic culling = less than 1% of the total populace? I think not!

But antibiotics and antivirals will still be effective. These are, after all,
diseases that effect Terrans as well.

There are (IIRC) at least 70 million pure racial Vilani in the old Vland Sector
- -- it was in one of the Digests or Challenges or whatever -- as per the Civil
War era. And they were not, as far as the article commented anyway, any more
susceptible to Terran Diseases than anyone else.

This is undoubtedly true to a degree, but it doesn\'t explain the 99% plus
survival rate of the original Vilani!

The thing is, to make bombs from *non*-military reactors, you have to
do a lot of re-processing of the fuel. This is messy and dangerous.
Terrorist types are most likely to kill themselves in the process of
trying. It\'s also a lot of tedious, finicky, not very glorious (or fun)
hard work, which tends to go counter to the mindset of your typical
terrorist. 

There are some advantages the high-TL terrorist would have in trying
this though. First of all, they could reduce a lot of the danger by
doing the work in space, outside the hull of the ship. But that
restricts you to some of the more tedious types of isotope seperation.

About the same way you would on a planet with a gravity of 3.68 g

Badly. Very badly. Their circulatory system won\'t be up to it for one.
They\'d essentially be invalids, and even flat on their back there could
be medical problems.

Note: the above is assuming that the Zilans *are* native, or that their
ancestors came to the planet long enough ago (millienia at least!) for
them to be adapted to the planet. If it\'s a colony that\'s only been
there a few generations, then they are *potentially* just as strong as
the players. But it may take them years of hard work to "adapt" to
normal gravity.

> Do the PC\'s look like supermen compared to the Zilan citizens when they
> are on planet?

Well, remember that they can\'t "leap tall buildings with a single bound".
While they can jump higher, what counts is their center of mass. So
they can raise their center of mass (call it the waistline) 3.68 times
higher. That\'s a lot different from the usual misconception that "if I
can jump up and touch a 10 foot ledge with my fingers, then I can touch
a 36 foot ledge here". To touch the 10 foot ledge you\'ve only raised
your center of mass from about 3 feet to about 4.5 feet. So under .272
g, you could raise it from 3 feet to 5.5 feet, that\'s a 2.5 foot
change. So the guy who could reach a 10 foot ledge with his fingertips
can now reach an 11 foot ledge....

You can lift a lot more, and win wrestling matches. But no super jumps.
Running is likely to turn into a mess until you are used to the extra
"bounce" in your step. The natives will likely be able to outrun *you*!

ps. if the center of mass bit is confusing, think about the difference
between where the fingertips were if he was just standing there, arm
outstreched, and where they are when he makes the jump. And for jumping
*over* something, consider the soles of the feet at the start (on the
ground) and in mid-jump.

In Jerry Pournelle\'s Falkenberg\'s Legion books, all of the Legion\'s

SCUDs were innacurate, but they weren\'t so innacurate that they didn\'t
actually "hit" stuff sometimes.  However, my father worked on the patriots to
make them more effectve after the gulf and Patriots don\'t "deflect" enemy
missiles, they blow them up into little pieces.  The little pieces DO have to
come down somewhere, but they are no longer as effective (at this point the
missile is no longer a big tube with an explosive/chemical warhead, it
becomes considerably smaller, non-explosive chunks).

Okay, well when T:2000 was written, the French SSBN\'s were 5 Le Redoutable
class and one L\'Inflexible class; all armed with 16 M4 missiles. Both the
classes are roughly equivilent to the USN Layfatte or the RN Resolution
class boats; and the M4 missile is roughly equivelant to the USN Poseidon
missile (these boats are now being replaced by the Le Triomphant class with
their M5 missiles, but it is very unlikely that all 6 boats will be replaced;
and the M5 is not much of an improvement on the M4). The French SSBN\'s
cruise in the Atlantic and Pacific and their missiles were (and probably
still are) targeted at the USSR. The M4 has a range of at least 2,500nm and
carries six 150Kt MIRV warheads. The French are able to maintain a minimum
of 2 boats on patrol at any time (3 or 4 is more normal). So in the *very*
unlikely event that the French wanted to nuke the US, they could hit the
coastal areas easily, but further inland would be a problem. The M5 has a
range of at least 3,200nm and carry a the same MIRV warheads as the M4.

The rest of the Marine Nationale is actually fairly pathetic. The two carriers
(Clemenceau and Foch) are roughly equivalent to the USN Midways built in the
late 2nd WW, and carry a mix of F-8E fighters (an adequate fighter in the 60\'s,
somewhat useless in the 90\'s), Super Etendard strike aircraft (an okay fair
weather strike aircraft), no AEW, and elderly Alise ASW aircraft (again,
adequate in the 60\'s). Both of these are due to be retired in the late 90\'s.
Their replacement will be a single Charles De Gaulle CVN, hopefully carrying
Rafale fighter/attack aircraft and ASW helicopters (max capacity 35 aircraft).
The French have no automated CIWS and they are extremely weak on air defence.
They have a few (12) good ASW ships but thats about it. The French have paid
a very high price for their independent nuclear deterant.

First of all; I know the canon sources you are referring too as to the die
back of the PoD. To put it simply, I think these are way too low (ie I think
canon is wrong). Given the nature of the problem, a die back of 10% to 30%
is not unreasonable. The only way for this to be avoided would be a massive
Terran intervention. The problem with this, is the level of intervention is
probably beyond the capacity of the Terrans (regardless of desire). To put
it in perspective. Here in New Zealand we immunise all children against six
common dieases (diptheria, polio, whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella).
Well actually we try to do this, but various factors mean we reach around 85%
to 90% immunisation. This involves a two vaccines (the triple vaccine against
the first three and the MMR vaccine against the second three; no prizes for
guessing where the names come from). To achieve effective immunity takes
no less than three sperate doses of each vaccine spread over 3 years. This
involves immunising approximately 60,000 children (about 2% of the population)
a year and consumes about 0.5% of our health spending. Now to protect the
Vilani against just our viral infections (we\'ll assume, incorrectly, that all
other infections can be treated with antibotics; I\'ll come to the problems
with this later). This involves innoculating 100% of the population against
(at bear minimum) several hundred infections. Even ignoring the logistics of
this feat, the cost is going to be phenominal. And you can\'t just put all
the vaccines in one syringe and squirt them in. This would overload even
the strongest Terran immune system. From what we understand the upper limit
is between 5 and 10 vaccines at one hit, with at least a month before you
can take the next one. You start to see the level of the task required.

Yep, they all lack the helper T cells. But this is not the major problem
for the Vilani. What is the killer for the Vilani is the degeneration of
their immune system due to evolving in a sterile environment. As far as we
can tell, the other minor races did not evolve in environments completely
free from the risk of infection; therefore while their immune system would
also have degenerated, it would not be as marked as in the Vilani.

This is a "dangerous" line of reasoning. We can explain things like Thruster
plates, anti-grav and jump drives as things we don\'t yet understand. But with
the immune system we have a good current working model. This is like saying
in the future, we have discovered that internal combustion engines don\'t in
fact work the way we thought.

Actually, I simplified the helper T cell process for clarity. The helper T
cells are capable of \'learning\' to indentify new organisms. The speed with
which they can \'learn\' is related to the similarity of the virus to ones
they already know how to detect. Thus in 1917, there would be very few
humans who did not have helper T cells capable of detecting many flu viruses.
Thus when the Spanish Flu came along our immune system could adapt quickly
to it. It\'s the mutant nature of the Flu which greatly lessened it\'s
viralence. Again, the Vilani do not have this advantage, due to the time of
seperation.

There are a lot of diseases which could make up the PoD. Take for instance
Pneumocytes carinii. This is a protoza parasite which resides within
perhaps 95% of the population. Normally it\'s no problem to us as it is kept
under control by our immune system. However if our immune system starts to
breakdown or weaken, it becomes quite lethal (it is a major cause of death
with AIDS sufferers). There are many of these protoza resident with in our
bodies all kept under control by the immune system and when our immune
system weakens they become killers. These are diseases which all Terrans
carry, but are uneffected by.

No, we are taking much less effective. Again this is not taken from Traveller
canon, but modern science. As we understand it a race which has spent nearly
300K years in a sterile environment will suffer much more than 1% degredation,
sure we don\'t know just how much, but we do know it will be more than a little.

Firstly, as yet we have no drug which can be classed as an antiviral agent.
Nor is their any sign of any likely to be developed in the next 50 years.
Not to say we won\'t in 300 years, but not to say we will. However, here\'s
another problem. Just how many hospital beds and doctors are there in the
ZS? Take the US as an example. In the US today there are 70 hospital beds
per 10,000 population, here in NZ we do better at around 100 per 10,000.
We know the Vilani never developed a medical \'shaman\', but it is rather
beyond belief that they never developed doctors and hospitals; after all
they still fall down and break their legs! So lets give the Vilani the same
number of hosital beds as the US. Now lets look at the Vilani doctors. These
are not like Terran doctors, these are almost exlusively trauma specialists.
Sure they have encountered the odd disease since spreading to space and most
doctors get some basic training in disease treatment, but this is a minor
factor. Now along come the Terrans and all of a sudden people are getting
sick, lots and lots of people. How do you treat disease? First you have to
indentify it, which is reliant on the doctor\'s experience and training (an
edu task); but the Vilani doctors are weak on this. Sure they\'ve got all the
lastest bulletins from Terra on what to look for, but its still not that
easy and it still comes down to experience and the Vilani still lack this.

So fairly soon the Vilani hospitals are bulging at the seams, beds in the
corridors and all that. The doctors and nurses are totally out of their
depth in treating diseases. Before you can adminster a drug, you have to
know what your fighting, then you have to know how much to administer, you
have to know what to look for to see if its working or not etc. So with
the level of infection, fairly soon the Vilani medical system collapses.
But what about Terran doctors? They don\'t have the same limitations. These
are but a drop in the bucket. Even assuming that Terran doctors are following
their humanitarian instincts and flocking to the ZS in droves, leaving the
Terran Confederation dangerously unstaffed; the shear numbers of the Vilani
relative to the Terrans means that they can\'t make a meaningful impact.

Bottom line: you can have all the drugs in the world, but they are utterly
useless unless you know how to use them.

This can be explained by a widespread immunisation program and several
thousand years of interbreading and evolution.

The Miller Milk Bottle
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
by Marc Miller

     Although the Traveller rules are rather complete, they do have a glaring
omission in the equipment section, and indeed, it has not been filled in the
"Journal of the Travellers\' Aid Society" Ship\'s Locker section either.  This
important piece of equipment is the milk bottle.
     Milk bottles are made of glass (fused silicon) containers used to hold
cow\'s milk for sale by merchants; less frequently (and depending on local
animal presence), goat or other mammal milk may be sold instead.  Milk
bottles appear at about tech level 3 or 4 (supplanting larger metal
containers) and do not occur past tech level 6 or 7, where they are replaced
by waxed-paper or plastic containers.
     Milk bottles are easy to find.  They are always found in markets selling
foodstuffs and sundries; they may be found on urban doorsteps in morning
hours on a throw of 9+.  At times, they are concealed in small cubical metal
insulating lockers, so a search may be necessary.  Milk bottles are rarely
found in restaurants, except in the kitchen, where they may be obtained from
refrigerators on a throw of 6+; otherwise the restaurant uses a bulk-storage
system.
     Milk bottles have a variety of uses.  They may be employed as clubs,
breaking to form daggers after the first blow is stuck.  The fact that they
are glass makes them excellent as cutting tools, to sever cords which bind
hands, to slice tires, or to cut cloth or leather.  Broken glass can be used
to make a simple alarm system:  The glass is spread on the floor, and if
intruders approach, the crunching sound gives them away.  If the intruders
are barefoot, their screams of pain add to the effectiveness of the alarm.
     Correctly used, a milk bottle can perform as a signal mirror for code
(heliograph) transmissions or to blind an unsuspecting enemy.  The sparkle of
a reflective glass bottle can be used to attract (or sometimes it repels)
birds, small animals, or other beings.  At times, shards of glass can be
traded to pack rats or other scavengers who occasionally accumulate truly
valuable things.  It is advisable to convert such shards to beads, however
crudely, by heating the edges to dull them; in addition, their value is
enhanced by piercing them (a laser rifle works nicely) for stringing.
     Milk bottles serve admirably for their original intended use: carrying
liquids.  They can hold water or other refreshments or can be used to carry
fuel.
     The liquid carrying ability can also be used to create weapons.  Since
glass is impervious to most acids, the acid attack comes immediately to mind.
 Throw 8+ for 5D damage; otherwise only 2D damage.  Allow DM -4 is the victim
has Dexterity of 9+, DM+3 if the attack is made with surprise.  Throw
separately 9+ to blind the victim (permanently unless tech level 8+ eye
transplant is available) regardless of other hits or wounding.  Another
weapon possibility is the firebomb.  When thrown, the firebomb will shatter
and burst into flame covering an area 15 meters in diameter.  All within the
area will receive hits amounting to 2D per turn; saving throw of 7+ (BM +2 if
Dexterity 9+) is allowed.  In addition, DM +2 on saving throw for heavy
clothing or personal armor is allowed; a firebomb will not affect the wearer
of battle dress unless an exact 12 is thrown.
     Milk bottles can be a source of income, too.  Because of their innate
value, they are generally provided as refundable/returnable containers.  At
tech level 3 the refund price for such containersis one cent (Cr0.01); this
effectively doubles at each succeeding tech level, up to 20 cents at TL7.  In
dire circumstances, a door-to-door search for bottles (empty or full) to
return can provide enough funds for small necessities.

Exceedingly doubtful.  The whole point of a SSBN is to get lost in the deep
ocean.  We are now finding out that we weren\'t nearly as good at tracking
Soviet subs as we thught, and that they could and did track Ohio class
SSBNs on occassion.

And they learn about this invasion when CNN covers the assult across the

the population, industry and commerce have stopped.  Millions of refugees
are choking the roads looking for a safe place.  The railroads are unusable
due to railyards being hit, and the effects of the EMP scrambling the
switching computers.

Nobody knows what is happening in Texas outside of Texas for months!  By
the time the two US Governments can respond, the Texas resistance has
already sent those durn commies running.

Those warehouses are impressive.  They are however, mostly placed on
military bases.  also, in the game, the US had been at war for a few years
already.

Tell me.  If you don\'t have enough to eat, just buried another family
member who died of cholera, are living in a burned out shed with 12 other
people, and are showing signs of radiation poisoning, are you going to
gladly march off to Texas because their *might* be Russians there?

In 1940, a panic broke out in Scotland over the rumor that the Germans had
landed.  A few people were shot in mistaken identity.  During wartime,
rumors fly faster than bullets.

If somebody invaded San Francisco, damn straight I\'d fight.  If the US was
nuked, and I was struggling just to eat, my priorities would be very
different.

Do you know what percentage of the French population was involved in the
Resistance?  Less than 1%.  99% of the French just endured the German
occupation.  They had guns, they had pride, but it was easier to just put
up with it.

In a post nuclear world, very few people will give a rat\'s ass about what\'s
happening in Texas.  The people in Texas, facing the immediate threat,
would organize and fight.

Ah, sweet arrogance.  We\'ve now learned that the Soviets are better pilots
than we thought.  We\'ve now had the chance to train with them.  They, and
their planes (esp. the MiG-29, -31, and Su-27) are of equal quality to the
F-15 Eagle.

Your scenario assumes a great deal, like everybody in the US agreeing to
it!  In the T2K backround, when the Soviet and American Atlantic Fleets
meet off of Norway, they destroy each other.  Only a few scattered ships
remain (In 2000, there are *two* nuclear submarines left on the planet.. a
US Los Angeles class, and an ice-bound Soviet boomer.)

You also assume that the government is functioning.  It isn\'t.
Communications are gone, Washington was nuked, most of the major command
centers were nuked.  This is why MilGov took over, and when the civilain
Congress attempted to reform, there was enough doubt to cause the
MilGov/CivGov schism.

As for the world depending on the US economy.  True, for the moment.  It
used to depend on the British economy, before that the Dutch ran the
world\'s money markets, before that the Spanish controlled much of it.  The
planet has survived all fo these changes, and now the balance of economic
power seems to be shifting to Asia\'s "Four Tigers."

Well, I was all ready to refute you on a scientific basis that high
temperatures must cause a problem.  Fortunately I decided to check my
sources (since there is an experimental fusion reactor within 200 feet of
me and I work with Fusion Scientists).   It seems Leonard is right.  If we
take our current reactor science as a prototype, then breaching a fusion
reactor at temp will cause the atmosphere in the room to rush *into* the
reactor chamber, which is held at a partial vacuum (.1 atm) while running.
The few paltry particles in there will not release a tremendous amount of
heat energy, because they apparently radiate in the wrong frequencies to
create a lot of heat.  (not that the last sentance does not make a lot of
sense to me so don\'t try tomake me explain it).

The only other recourse I can think of off the top of my head is the
opposite.  Since there is Liquid Hydrogen flowing in and around the reactor
perhaps it would be more appropriate to *freeze* the characters as they are
bathed in L-Hyd vapors.

>And the ship *won\'t* explode if you breach the fusion bottle.

Actually, I was thinking of the cascading catastrophic failure of other
systems as the power went unexpectedly off-line, or the power plant threw
off streams of superheated plasma at the other systems around it.  There
ought to be some sort of "hollywood risk" associated with events like
firefights in closed spaces.

There\'s acouple of errors here.  While Andrew\'s argument that the Vilani
immune systems must actually be inherently weaker than the Terran immune
systems is very convincing, all the sources actually say is that the
Vilani were not immune to a lot of Terran bacteria and viruses, which is
hardly surprising, since they had never encountered them. Also, the
quotes about "harmless" implies that if they were harmless to the Terrans 
then they really should also be harmless to the Vilani. That simply does
not follow.

True. But then, there are no game mechanics that deals with Vilani before the
Year 0.

Wait a minute. I thought _First Survey_ detailed things the way they are in
the Year 0? That\'s 1500 years after the _fall_ of the RoM, enough time for 
a population to grow about a million times (assuming a doubling of the 
population every 75 years, something quite possible according to TNE rules). 
In short, conditions in Year 0 is not very helpful when it comes to proving
anything about conditions at the end of the RoM, much less before and at the
beginning of the RoM, which is the time we\'re really dealing with.

Not quite. The plagues caused by Vilani encounters with Terran pathogens, of
which the PoD was the most famous, caused over a billion deaths (which means
more than a billion and propably considerably less than 2 billion, but IMO
\'over a billion\' could mean something close to 1.5 billion (native English
speakers correct me if I\'m wrong).

There are at least three stages to these plagues: The first plagues were
brought to the Vilani by Terran POWs, which means during the Interstellar
wars, and we don\'t know anything about how extensive they were. Next a lot
of plagues broke out more or less simultaneously "in the wake of advancing
Solomani troops and affected worlds from the Solomani Rim to Vland". These
are the plagues that are collectively (and fallaciously) known as _the_
Plague of Duskir and must take place shortly after the end of the last
Interstellar War. Finally a number of plagues are said to have been spread 
to a number of worlds by Solomani immigrants.

>5) Terrans were not affected by the PoD.

Not to speak of, anyway.

There is nothing ridiculously high about a population increase of 0.9% per
year (which will give you a doubling of the population in 75 years). In
fact, unless you assume that the Vilani practiced some kind of population 
control for most of their 10,000 years in space, they would have filled
every nook and cranny of Charted Space long before they encountered the
Terrans. And, given that, they could just as easily have had 10 million
people apiece on the 1000 most hospitable worlds in the Siru Zirka for
a total population of 10 billion.

My own guesstimate would lie somewhat higher, on a total population of
100 billion, but that\'s all it is, a guesstimate.

>Fact 6) The Spanish Flu, *the* most lethal plague known to mankind 
>throughout recorded history, killed around 20 million of the planetary

But not, of course, 1.6% of those directly affected.

>Fact 7) Most people today would be completely unaware of either a) the 
>existence of the Spanish Flu or, b) its relative or absolute lethality.

True, but irrelevant. The general knowledge of the Spanish Flu and any
other plague has little to do with how lethal it was. If the PoD did no
more than change the demographical composition of a dozen worlds close
to Terra then it would have earned atleast a footnote in the history books.

>The PoD killed 0.3% *at best* of the pre-RoM populace. 

If by *at best* you mean *at most* (ie. \'at worst\' ;-) then you are wrong.
If my guesstimate is right it would be 1.5% and it could be higher yet if
we make other assumptions.

>We don\'t known how widespread it was, but there are hints that it and 
>allegedly terran originated diseases at the time indicate that it was 
>*very* widespread.

All we know is that it affected worlds from the Solomani Rim to Vland and 
that in the end several thousand planets were infected and the final death
toll was over a billion. It is impossible from the text to tell whether
it alludes to all three phases of the plagues or just the PoD alone.

>1)  Vilani immune systems were 99% effective vs. Terran diseases -- 

Let\'s go with the 99% survival rate. It is close enough to the one I 
consider the most likely one that I won\'t quibble about it. Which means
that:

1% of the total Vilani population died.
An unknown percentage of them were infected but survived on their own.
An unknown percentage of them were infected but saved by the Terrans.
An unknown percentage of them were immunized before they were infected.
An unknown percentage of them were not exposed to infection.
The 1% is an average, which almost guarantees that the  figure is higher
for some planets and lower for other planets.   
The figure may or may not represent deaths in the Plague of Duskir alone,
so the deaths from first and third stage plagues may or may not be included. 

Which means that we really can\'t say anything at all about the Vilani
immune systems just based on that one figure.

About the only thing we can say for sure is that no high-population world
lost enough Vilani to make the Terrans into the majority there, but since
we don\'t know howmany high-population worlds the Vilani had, that\'s not
much help.

Absolutely true, except for the bit about being unaffected. Just because
they survived dosen\'t mean they were unaffected. _On the average_ the
Terran help must have been pretty damn effective. That dosen\'t mean they
didn\'t fail spectacularily in some instances.

No indeed. It is very much material. If it had just been the Library Data 
entry in TD#10 and the essay in _S&A_, then the only indisputable canonical
fact would be that in 1100 a lot of people believed in the PoD, which might
mean much or little. In that case, in fact, your theory would be just as
valid as the orthodox view (But, and I wish to emphasize this, not any more 
valid than the orthodox view; your theory might be true, but there would
still be no real reason why it should be). But since we have an autorial
statement about the PoD, that is no longer the case.  

>The facts are that the PoD killed less than 1% of the populace of the Ziru

As I\'ve explained before, that does not follow. How well-known an event is
depends only on how much publicity it gets. Thus, while we would expect
monumental events to be well-known, the reverse cannot be assumed.

IIRC Duskir is supposed to have used Terran texts. Unlikely is not the same
as impossible, so the minimal change to canon is to leave it at that: An
unlikely, but nevertheless true, historical event. If it pleases you to
believe that Duskir didn\'t do it, feel free; it is "only" mentioned in the
1100 data, and may therefore be untrue. I guess the first authorized
Traveller author to write about that aspect of the RoM is free to chose.

It was also in the (presumably Imperial) Library Data in TD#10. Check Mark
Seemann\'s Traveller pages for the whole entry.

The story essentially goes: "When we  conquered the Vilani we accidentally
infected them with dreadful diseases, but mostofthem survived. Some planets
were heavily depopulatedso that we became the majority on them, but that
wasn\'t something we did deliberately, it was an unfortunate accident.

What could be the Solomani\'s reason to tell this story? 1) It\'s the truth
and it dosen\'t harm our present agenda, or 2) it\'s covering up something
worse.

But there _are_ no allegations of terrible crimes. As far as the story goes
all those deaths were accidental.

What doubts? Again, the story dosen\'t cast any doubts on the Terrans at all.

What is obvious is that ignoring the authorial evidence of TD#20 the PoD
could be a total myth, but it could equally well be completely true.
Given the evidence of TD#20 it must be considered pretty much the truth,
though there is room for some degree of alternative thinking.

and were training with wooden rifles.   Red Dawn ...I hate to rain on your parade, but
after at least 4 year of full blown war I don\'t think there will be that
many young men or woman around that haven\'t been recruited or know how to
handle firearms to form an effective fighting group.  As for lower skills
of the 3rd world countries they make up for it with sheer numbers of
personal just like Vietnam and as for the like of LA street gangs with the
Hispanics. Let us remember Los Almos.  On a tour map I have it points out
that the Hispanics population in 1980 for LA was over 2 million and the
whole population of Southern California was only 13.6 Million

hmmmm... that they stop the campains of "Duck and Cover" in the early 70\'s
because thay decieded it would taken too long to evacuated citys.  It is my
belief that it takes ICBM somewhere between 5-14 mins from the USSR to USA.
On a side note  War Machine issue 2 point out the fact that Americans have
conceded that fixed locations basing concept makes the ICBM inherently
vulnerable. This, coupled with the fact that Soviet forces of ss-18 Model 4
and ss-19  Model 3 (read Moble) ICBM can distroy the majority of the US
missiles and associated command and control and communications centres in a
first strike, Plus the ability to reload these launch silos within a day
and move to a new location makes them deadly.
 
 also most of the arms producing factories

Military reserves read big targets. Let see M1 MBT range 280mph, top speed
45mp,
number deployed in USA some 3000(7058 had been produced by 1988) and this
is only the M1 not the later versons or one stationed else were in the
world or non combat support vechicles. And this is the army alone to keep a
war machine like the alive would reqiure a hell of a lot of gas (M1 uses
Gas insted of Diesel)

You can also bet that every time theres a big solar flare, that they close
the satellites up to protect them from the EMP. The America were amazed
when they got there hand on a new Russian fighter to find it had vacuum
tubes until someone pointed it out that it could survive EMP blast. As for
these satellites I don\'t know, But if microwave are relay that deadly I am
glad I dont own a mobile phone.  and as for high tech gadgets hmmm... The
Soviet plane/boat that travels on or just above the water and can carry
tanks for rapid redeployment. The Australian Radar crystal which amplifies
radar signal a 100 fold developed by the CSIRO which I have been told makes
your Stealth fighter Pointless( As for details about this I don\'t think is
a secret, it is currently been tried in the US.)

The fact that USSR has build some 1178 ICBMs since 1978 compared with none
by America. and some 2000 replacement rounds is assessed as being far above
the normal requiement for the soviets to maintain a credible deterrent
force.

You have got to be joking here because France is still pissed of  with
America about who controls the armed forces in europe under NATO. 

As for domination of space in 2300 I think it should had been Australia

HOPE, which is also cancelled (for all practical purposes) - there might be
flights of a subscale demonstrator.

The fashionable approach to spaceflight today is single-stage-to-orbit 
(or single-stage with slight modifications). Most ambitious is LockMart\'s
X-33 (a suborbital demonstrator leading to a flight vehicle to be called
VentureStar). It\'s a vertical-takeoff/horizontal landing (like the shuttle)
lifting body design, with aerospike engines; shuttle-sized payloads to orbit
but with a substantial risk of turning into something as expensive and 
complex as the shuttle.

Several less ambitous proposals are being floated around by small companies -
including fully-reuseable TSTOs, SSTO\'s that take off with empty tanks and
use mid-air refuelling before igniting their rockets, and a SSTO orbital
helicopter called ROTON. Hard to see which ones are likely to actually 
fly...but it\'s potentially very exciting.

The situation was more an involvement by default rather than an involvement
by design.  The nuclear strike and its after-effects killed the President
and Vice President, but a legitimate successor was found after a few
chaotic days.  One of the first acts taken by the new president was to
declare martial law.  Unfortunately, the successor dies (I think from a
heart attack) a while afterwards, and there were no more legitimate
successors *that is to say, there were no surviving cabinet members, the
speaker of the House and the President of teh Senate were also dead, as
were the members of the Supreme Court.  In addition, most of Congree had
also been killed, making it impossible to convene a session with a
legitimate quorum.  The martial law declaration was still valid, however,
and there was no limitation of time involved (the intent being that the
President would rescind the declaration at the appropriate time).

Later on, s small group of surviving congressmen, reinforced with political
cronies and warlord-appointed replacements, convened a session of Congress
and selected a new President.  The US military high command beleived this
is not permitted under the Constitution (presidential succession is VERY
murky, and there are very specific rules for picking emergency replacement
congressmembers), and refused to accept orders from the new Congress and
President, demanding instead new national elections to convene a legitimate
Congress.

Some Army friends of mine in the legal area were very interested in this
game scenario, from a professional standpoint.  They were all of the
opinion that the Joint Cheifs were justified in their refusal to recognize
the new civilian government.  Apparently, there is a department within FEMA
that is tasked with resolving these sorts of situations in an emergency
(sounds like IRIS), and they have a very clear list of who is in the line
of succession.

	Yeah, what James said. If you want to see what can be sqoze out of
IC engines, look at the design of a top end crotch rocket motorcycle...a
few years back, production Yamaha 1200\'s were putting out more
acceleration than anything legal on the road and most things that weren\'t
legal on the road...like F16\'s ;-)

Last I saw some of these things were running toward a top end of over
20,000 rpm!

Of course, if you want to be really insane, I mean truly insane, look at
what they get out of top fuel dragsters these days. These puppies have
higher acceleration rates than _anything_ on the planet and most things
off. What\'s holding them down, so to speak, is not engine technology, but
clutch technology...getting the power from the engine TO the wheels
without blowing the transmission and clutch into tiny little pieces.

Most top fuellies don\'t have the clutch fully engaged until the reace is
mostly over.

  Excuse me?  Alabama got its reputation not from vicious rumor, but
from fact.  I could have just as easily inserted Georgia, Mississippi,
South Carolina or any of a number of other states.  I doubt seriously
that the population of Bavaria as a whole is out to lynch Turks, yet
enough incidents have happened there to justify some comment on it.  The
situation reminded me of America\'s Deep South (not everybody there is
out a lynch blacks or foreigners, but...), thus my comments.

   As for militia "nazis" (I assume that you speak of Aryan Nation and
similar groups, not militia groups as a whole), they are pretty much
everywhere, North and South.  We are fortunate that their numbers are
are small, though one would not get that impression from left-wing
journalists, who\'s favorite hobby it seems is trying to uncover "the big
Nazis conspiracy" that is suppose to be lurking just around the corner.

   The next time you see her, inform her that volcanoes have done more

   Shall we try to plug up all the volcanoes?

Actually, I liked MT.  The design sequences were acceptable, and I have not
used a published system for combat in ages.  On the other hand, I liked
FF&S much. much more.  fit better with my gearhead ways.

Given that starships are usually most constrained by volume, it makes a lot
of sense to describe cargos in cubic meters.  How much they weigh is rarely
a concern, except for a really big ship carrying a dense cargo.

 I wouldn\'t call it training so much as aversion therapy. Anyone standing
in the way when the alarm went off Got Knocked down. Any one not
recognized in your assigned Security area was a legit target. Primary
security areas are special weapons magazines, reactor controls, cdic,
and radio rooms.
Anti-Boarding stations was fun also. All the .50 BMGs were mounted,
and all SAF members were armed and stationed at the rails.

These two aliens are significant enough that they each deserve their own

Dave and I would like to do this, and specifically have naval vessels,
robots, and personal cybernetics on the list of items we\'d definitely like
to include.  Whether or not this actually appears would depend on IG more
than anything else.

:-)  I\'ve long been a proponent of adding Ether Propellors to FF&S, but so

ether flyer into the Gilbert and Sullivan Traveller adventure he wrote
for Travellers\' Digest, though.  ;-)

I\'d say you\'ve got the main ingredient here.  As long as it is fun, it

In all this heated opinion that sticks on the TML like thick mayo, I

Possibly - don\'t stop a nuclear mine/charge on a nice quiet SS or even a
cargo ship in a US harbour. The old, famous briefcase bomb routine.

How good the French technology is would be interesting - I mean, the UK
developed its systems from US power and weapon systems., but the French
went it alone.

T2K(*) has a vehicle system - it\'s called Fire Fusion and Steel.... (or
should be if what the blurb on the second edition said about the house
system is true).

Absolutely *not*. I don\'t play TNE because I intensely dislike the rules
system (although there are some nice bits like the space combat..) I own
most (all but 3) TNE books, but I prefer the CT/MT eras and use T4.1 / T4
in them. The only things in TNE that make me froth at the mouth are the
abandonment of Thruster Plates and the way that the plot was hidden from
the Refs. And then GDW had to fold.

TNE - it is a great system if you like your games that way - personally, I
tend to be minimalist on the rules front. My comment was refering to the
complaint about the 2300 timeline which was saying it was no good with the
French dominating it. I never complained about the release of Virus on the
Traveller background - audacious and awe inspiring - and its effects. I
like both the Regency and the Reformation coalition, but prefer not to play
in them.

The crux of my point was meant to be that even if you don\'t like a
background, it doesn\'t make it invalid. You can always play in a different
milieau / background.

But in the context of the discussion the US Navy is fighting a war for

Possibly - I don\'t tend to under estimate French nuclear capacity though.

Hmmm.  The Spinward Marches was settled in the 600\'s.  My campaign is
currently in 1105.  That means that the Zilan natives have only been
there for 500 years.

So, you are saying that Zilan natives will be just like my PCs who are
going there?



I\'ve got a problem here.  Maybe it is a problem with sci-fi and real
science in general.

Zila is a major agricultural center in the Aramis subsector.  Some of
you have heard of the famous Zilan eiswein.  There are three major
wineries there who ship product all over the Spinward Marches and into
Vargr space.

Now, when you read about Zila in the module (The Traveller Adventure),
it is really just like any other planet.  It is earth-like, standard
atmosphere, lush and pretty, and conducive to growing grapes.

Then, I run the planet through the WBG, and I get all of the things it
is supposed to be except the gravity.

Now, I\'m stuck with a sci-fi planet that has really low grav.  That\'s
OK, except I\'m not sure how these people ever leave their planet.

And, there are several planets like this in the Imperium.  Communities
in space stations and on moons I can handwave away by saying that the
facility they are in have tuned grav plates to 1G.  But, of all these
low tech worlds--especially the ones who have breathable atmospheres
and, thus, aren\'t always inside a faciltiy, these people are getting
pretty used to the gravity pull of the world.

If it is such a problem for humans to live here, then why was the place
settled 500 years ago in the first place!

I need a handwave, a head thought, something to feel better about this.

Kenneth.

	Not to mention the fact the military vehicles can run on wood

nuked and involved in ground war for years . the soviets also must have
developed stealth ICBMs if they managed to catch all of the aircraft on

	Of the early 3I had its Tl12 copy protection methods.IMHO mainly
	based on public keys and signed object which where dynamicaly linked

	that we (the solomanies) have a techlevel bonus in computer, so
	we can have a clue of how Tl10 computers look like. Tl10 to 12 are
	called dynamicaly linked and in my private handwaving this means
	nothing more that there is not raw data, but dynamical linkable
	objects. If you buy them, you download them and they are certified
	by the sellers key, they install on your machine, and the copy
	you have dos only run 3 specified computers (bridge,engine,backup)
	because your computer also has a public key certificate.

	Once the tool is installed on your computers you can access them
	at any point because they are dynamicaly linked. When accessing
	them a parts of the object will be dynamicaly linked into the
	computer you use for "terminal". Hard cryptographie will constrain
	security.

	The late 3I had Tl13+ computers which are holographic linked,
	holographic linked is a prestep to automatic intelligence, you
	have with Tl16+ synaptical linked systems. But Tl16+ never worked
	as exspected (see Kinunir) so the late 3I used a living silicon

    'body' => '> Okay, I\'m letting you know. I\'m interested in seeing the HTH tweak.

Here\'s another post you may be interested in.  It\'s a tweak on stun 
damage.

Kenneth.

================================================================


In thinking about my first post on Ken\'s Combat Tweaks, I have 
remembered another tweak that I\'ve implemented since I\'ve started 
using the T4 rules.  This one has to do with Stun Damage.


Healing Stun Damage:

Stun damage.  See the rule on page 57.  It says that a character 
making a hand to hand attack can attack to stun rather than do real 
damage.

I actually like this rule, and I can see its use in combat.  But, I 
question how much control you have over yourself when you are 
pounding them to knock them our or subdue them.

It seems to me that there is a fine line between attacking to stun 
and attacking to kill.  In the heat of a fight, I\'m not sure a 
character has complete control over that.

In this vein, I have tweaked the stun damage rule.  

I do everything as written--basically running the combat as normal.  
But, after the fight is over, I make a distinction over which damage 
is stun and which is leathal.

How I do this is simple, and an example best describes it.

We\'ve got Jake, who\'s beat to a pulp after a fight--but still 
standing.  His original stats were 875.  With the damage from the 
fight, his stats are now 132.

What I do is roll in 1 D6 increments how much of that damage is 
stun (we are taking into account that his opponent attacked him 
with the intent to stun).  All damage that is not stun damage is 
leathal.

So, first I\'d look at Jake\'s Str.  He had an 8.  Now, he\'s got a 1.  
He\'s lost 7 points.  I\'d roll (or have the player roll) 1 D6 to see 
how many points of the damage were stun.  I roll and get a 3.

Then I check the next 6 point increment--but this is only 1 point 
(we\'ve already checked the other 6 points).  Rolling higher dice with 
the player, the player wins, and this is also considered a point of 
stun damage.

Looking at what we\'ve just done, we know that Jake has 4 stun 
points out of the total 7 damage points done to him.  

I\'d go on to check the other two stats in the same manner, and after 
that\'s done, we let him heal.

I heal all stun damage first because it heals so much faster.  Then, 
when that is completed, we start at that point to heal the lethal 
damage.

This procedure does not need to be done every time.  You only need to 
do it when you need to know a character\'s current hit point state 
before he is healed--like if Jake gets into another fight within 24 
hours.

Otherwise, given Jake gets proper medical attention, all of 
his wounds heal anyway, and you don\'t have to worry about it.



Reducing Damage for Checked Blows:

On page 57, where they talk about stun damage, it mentions that some 
weapons can be used to inflict stun damage.  They refer to a listing, 
but I haven\'t found it in the book.  Maybe it was on the missing 
weapon\'s chart.

I assume they are talking about blunt melee weapons--at least that 
seems logical to me.

Given this, I\'d handle stun damage in the same way.  If a player 
indicates that he wants his character to really check his blow, I\'d 
reduce his damage by one die.  That way, less damage is applied to 
the victim, but I would check the same way to see how much of it was 
stun damage.



Stun Damage from Explosions:

One last thing about stun damage.  The EA, on page 9, lists an 
optional rule about explosions.  There, it says you could put a limit 
on the maximum lethal damage an explosion can do--3 dice is suggested 
with the rest of the explosion damage being considered non-lethal 
(stun).

That\'s one way to handle it.  The EA also suggests another way to do 
this, and I like this one better.  Half the damage that penetrates 
armor is considered lethal--the other half is not.

You can roll damage and divide by two, but what I do is divide the 
damage dice in two.  For example, if 4 dice of damage is being 
applied to the character, 2 dice are considered lethal (I roll it) 
and 2 dice are considered stun (and, I roll that seperately).

This keeps with the spirit of the rule but also adds some variety and 
uncertainty to the roll--I could roll 2 points stun and 12 points 
lethal, or even vice versa.

If the damage dice are odd--say, 3 dice of damage penetrate, I\'d 
either roll the player higher die to see if it is 2 dice stun and 1 
dice damage or the other way around.  Or, I\'d decide based on the 
situation (if the character is in a fox hole and a grenade lands on 
him doing 3 dice--I\'d say that automatically it is 2 dice lethal and 
1 die stun.)

It is clear from the EA that the ref should get a good general rule 
that he likes with regards to explosive damage.  Between the EA and 
Book 1, there are three different ways to handle this type of damage.

Let me suggest a fourth.  It\'s a combination of the two optional 
rules in the EA.

The first rule I mentioned above says that the first 3 dice of an 
explosion is considered lethal damage, and all other damage after 
that point is considered stun.  The second rule above says that half 
the damage of an explosion is considered stun and the other half 
lethal.

Combining those two, consider this as an explosion damage option.  
The first 3 dice of an explosion that penetrates armor is considered 
lethal, and after that point, damage is halved between lethal and 
stun (either divide total damage points in two or divide dice in 
two--take your pick).

I think that explosions should be pretty hazardous, so I\'m inclined 
to use this fourth option in my game.

Here\'s another post you may be interested in.  It\'s a tweak on stun 
damage.

Kenneth.

================================================================


In thinking about my first post on Ken\'s Combat Tweaks, I have 
remembered another tweak that I\'ve implemented since I\'ve started 
using the T4 rules.  This one has to do with Stun Damage.


Healing Stun Damage:

Stun damage.  See the rule on page 57.  It says that a character 
making a hand to hand attack can attack to stun rather than do real 
damage.

I actually like this rule, and I can see its use in combat.  But, I 
question how much control you have over yourself when you are 
pounding them to knock them our or subdue them.

It seems to me that there is a fine line between attacking to stun 
and attacking to kill.  In the heat of a fight, I\'m not sure a 
character has complete control over that.

In this vein, I have tweaked the stun damage rule.  

I do everything as written--basically running the combat as normal.  
But, after the fight is over, I make a distinction over which damage 
is stun and which is leathal.

How I do this is simple, and an example best describes it.

We\'ve got Jake, who\'s beat to a pulp after a fight--but still 
standing.  His original stats were 875.  With the damage from the 
fight, his stats are now 132.

What I do is roll in 1 D6 increments how much of that damage is 
stun (we are taking into account that his opponent attacked him 
with the intent to stun).  All damage that is not stun damage is 
leathal.

So, first I\'d look at Jake\'s Str.  He had an 8.  Now, he\'s got a 1.  
He\'s lost 7 points.  I\'d roll (or have the player roll) 1 D6 to see 
how many points of the damage were stun.  I roll and get a 3.

Then I check the next 6 point increment--but this is only 1 point 
(we\'ve already checked the other 6 points).  Rolling higher dice with 
the player, the player wins, and this is also considered a point of 
stun damage.

Looking at what we\'ve just done, we know that Jake has 4 stun 
points out of the total 7 damage points done to him.  

I\'d go on to check the other two stats in the same manner, and after 
that\'s done, we let him heal.

I heal all stun damage first because it heals so much faster.  Then, 
when that is completed, we start at that point to heal the lethal 
damage.

This procedure does not need to be done every time.  You only need to 
do it when you need to know a character\'s current hit point state 
before he is healed--like if Jake gets into another fight within 24 
hours.

Otherwise, given Jake gets proper medical attention, all of 
his wounds heal anyway, and you don\'t have to worry about it.



Reducing Damage for Checked Blows:

On page 57, where they talk about stun damage, it mentions that some 
weapons can be used to inflict stun damage.  They refer to a listing, 
but I haven\'t found it in the book.  Maybe it was on the missing 
weapon\'s chart.

I assume they are talking about blunt melee weapons--at least that 
seems logical to me.

Given this, I\'d handle stun damage in the same way.  If a player 
indicates that he wants his character to really check his blow, I\'d 
reduce his damage by one die.  That way, less damage is applied to 
the victim, but I would check the same way to see how much of it was 
stun damage.



Stun Damage from Explosions:

One last thing about stun damage.  The EA, on page 9, lists an 
optional rule about explosions.  There, it says you could put a limit 
on the maximum lethal damage an explosion can do--3 dice is suggested 
with the rest of the explosion damage being considered non-lethal 
(stun).

That\'s one way to handle it.  The EA also suggests another way to do 
this, and I like this one better.  Half the damage that penetrates 
armor is considered lethal--the other half is not.

You can roll damage and divide by two, but what I do is divide the 
damage dice in two.  For example, if 4 dice of damage is being 
applied to the character, 2 dice are considered lethal (I roll it) 
and 2 dice are considered stun (and, I roll that seperately).

This keeps with the spirit of the rule but also adds some variety and 
uncertainty to the roll--I could roll 2 points stun and 12 points 
lethal, or even vice versa.

If the damage dice are odd--say, 3 dice of damage penetrate, I\'d 
either roll the player higher die to see if it is 2 dice stun and 1 
dice damage or the other way around.  Or, I\'d decide based on the 
situation (if the character is in a fox hole and a grenade lands on 
him doing 3 dice--I\'d say that automatically it is 2 dice lethal and 
1 die stun.)

It is clear from the EA that the ref should get a good general rule 
that he likes with regards to explosive damage.  Between the EA and 
Book 1, there are three different ways to handle this type of damage.

Let me suggest a fourth.  It\'s a combination of the two optional 
rules in the EA.

The first rule I mentioned above says that the first 3 dice of an 
explosion is considered lethal damage, and all other damage after 
that point is considered stun.  The second rule above says that half 
the damage of an explosion is considered stun and the other half 
lethal.

Combining those two, consider this as an explosion damage option.  
The first 3 dice of an explosion that penetrates armor is considered 
lethal, and after that point, damage is halved between lethal and 
stun (either divide total damage points in two or divide dice in 
two--take your pick).

I think that explosions should be pretty hazardous, so I\'m inclined 
to use this fourth option in my game.

Well if Dr. Pournelle came up with the idea, it\'s a good bet it\'s a sound
one.  He\'s an extremely intelligent man with multiple PHD\'s in various

Based on my experience, they issue shotguns to the ship\'s security
personnel for a couple of reasons.  Traveller accurately reflects one of
those reasons.  If your charactor has no skill in Gun Cbt, which weapon
does he have the best chance to hit with?  Answer - the shotgun!  It\'s
easy to learn, and once learned it does not require a lot of maintenance
to keep your skill at an acceptable level.

It also is capable of inflicting a fair amount of damage to personnel,
while minimizing equipment damage.  Of course, it\'s kind of hard to
provide advancing personnel cover with one, which is why the teams are
split between handguns and shotguns. 

And yes, on American ships (at least as of 3 years ago), if a security
alert is called away and you are in the area, you hit the deck.  We were
trained to look for movement and home in on it.  A fair number of my
shipmates spent some time secured and on the deck \'cause they were moving
when my team would go by.  (It wasn\'t nearly as amusing on my last ship
when the marines did it to me...:)

Since I\'ve driven a BMP-3, I\'d hardly call it a myth.  I was refering to
the T-90 as shown in T2K.

They\'re calling it the T-90?  I though a new name had been chosen...

I\'ve been silent through this. But after 15 years in either cav or
infantry as a US Army NCO, this _stupidity_ has to be answered. In the
Gulf, we fought against poorly trained,  even worsley equiped, and brain
damaged lead, soldiers. Even in it\'s worst place, the soviet government
would have engaged us in a war that  would have been far different. For
better or worse, they would have believed the were fighting for Rodina.
And that is _all_ that would matter to every soldat in the Red army. We
stand, as soldiers, against the fall of night; from whomever that
darkness may come.

This is starting to sound like a Monty Python bit...

Right, in addition to the American forces, some 500,000 or so, there were,
in no particular order, Australians, Canadians, South Koreans, Thais, and
quite possibly commando pygmy shrews!

I will point out that the Canadians went as members of the US military.

Struggling mightily to bring this back to Traveller, how much would

We\'ve seen here that even between alleged allies, feelings can run hot.

SPUTTER!

You\'re going to fly a F-111 on wood alchol?!?   Riigghhtt....

BTW: This is my last post on this topic.  If you wish to continue, please
email me privately.

I\'m now looking at the U.S. Nuclear targets list in T2K.

As of June 2000, the US casulties stood at 135.2 million, or 52% of the
population.  Think about it.  Every other person is killed either in the
attack, or in the immediate aftermath.  Among the targets were Washington,
Andrews AFB, and Ft. Meade; which took a combined 1.25Mt.  Also in the same
region were hits to Arlington, Quantico, and Ft. AP Hill (1.5Mt).  

The first strikes were decapitation hits.  The President was gone.

Now, the Military.  According to the American Combat Vehicle Handbook, the
following forces were in the US as of 1 July 2000:

Colorado: 100 Inf Division  5000 men, 6 tanks
          Cadet Brigade 900 men, 2 tanks
Hawaii:   29th Inf Bde 3000 men, 8 tanks
East Coast:
          78 Inf Div 1000 men, no tanks
          43rd MP Bde 1400 men, no tanks
Central/Southern US:
          194th Armored Bde 1600 men, 36 tanks
          197th Inf Bde 1500 men, 13 tanks
          49 Arm Div   3000 men, 19 tanks
          95 Inf Div 4000 men, 3 tanks
          85 Inf Div (1st Bde only) 400 men, no tanks
          98 Inf Div 3000 men, 4 tanks
California:
          40 Inf Div (less 1st Bde) 3000 men, 16 tanks
          46 Inf Div 1000 men, no tanks
          221st MP Bde 700 men, no tanks
          91 Inf Div (L) 600 men, no tanks
          49th MP Bde 700 men, no tanks
US/Canadian Northwest:
          10 Inf Div (Mountain) 1000 men, 2 light tanks
          1st Inf Bde (Artic Recon) 400 men, no tanks
          2nd Inf Bde (Artic Recon) 300 men, no tanks
          47 Inf Div  5000 men, no tanks
          104 Inf Div (L) 4000 men, 4 tanks

This doesn\'t include Engineering Brigades, who I imagine would be pretty
busy.  Civ Gov controls two Infantry Divisions along with several brigades.

Consider that a normal Infantry Brigade has 3000 men and 48 tanks.  A
division has three brigades.  Starting to understand what has happened?

China was nuked too.  In 2300, China is three seperate countries, only one
of which (Manchuria) has any sort of interstellar presence.

By the way, the flight tiome from a ballistic missile sub to target is 5
minutes from launch.

as I said above, any follow-ups on this to my personal email please.

No software above a certain complexity is ever truly bug-free.  A computer
with well documented errors is stable, granted, but is usually never
bug-free.  As a result, software will constantly have to be patched and
upgraded.  I don\'t think that a completely "read only" computer architecture
will ever come about.

They\'ll be some adaption.. the possibilitiy that Zilan natives will suffer
heart propblems on higher grav worlds is still there, simplyt because their
entire lives have been spent taking it easy, so to speak.

Given a choice, i\'d prefer to settle a lower g planet.. easier to get off
of it!  Probably, the original settlers saw the O2 atmosphere and all the
nice water and decided it was more than worth it.  Adapting to the lower g
would be simple.

Have you read kim Stanley Robinson\'s Mars triology?  A great deal of time
is spent going into the adaptations the Martian colonists go through,
especially when on of them visits Earth.

Your average Zilan is going to be tall and willowy.  Even the weight
lifters are going to have that look, since they don\'t fight as much gravity
when growing up.  They might have problems with weak bones, sinc ehte same
amount of calcium is being distributed along a larger skeleton.

The world\'s lifeforms will have similar adaptations.. impossibly high
trees, delicate structures.. all are possible.

Volcanoes don\'t directly damage the ozone layer - injection of chlorine into
the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions is pretty negligible (all the chlorine
in volcanoes gases is in water-soluable form...) Volcanoes do indirectly
enhance the breakdown of ozone by chloroflourocarbons, by (among other things)
providing small particles to act as sites for the CFC reactions to take
place. 

Harold is correct, though, that rocket exhausts are negligible compared to 
the damage caused by man-made CFCs; and even when CFC\'s are finally gone 
rocket exhausts are likely to remain negligible (rockets don\'t spend much
time in the stratosphere.)

Only skimmed FFS2 at the moment, but the drop tanks are in, and there is no
mention of their late deployment in the Imperium. So it is potentially a
canon breaker.

Superb,

and the rebellion does start because Dulinor pre-recorded the
announcement... and his daughter takes the fleet built up, knowing that it
is possibly her only chance of survival. Meanwhile, the *real* Strephon
returns from visting Longbow II and realises that the civil war needs to be
queashed to save his people. lucan is executed for attempted murder of his
brother. The Solomani mobilise in a campaign to liberate Terra (as the
Imperial fleet is fighting th rebellion).

IIRC one of the MT publications state that Lucan suppressed the news
initially, stopping all launches from Capitol. Can\'t remember where I read
that though (Reebellion Sourcebook?)

So it is possible that only the military couriers and Imperiallines J6
ships got out with the news in the first week. Unlikely though.

....which doesn\'t cause many problems if you don\'t expect gravity, which is
after all the very weakest of the four fundamental forces, to solve all
your problems.  "Gravitics" isn\'t magic -- it probably has very limited
utility beyond transportation (which is a big enough gain in itself!)

The energy costs or mass equivalencies of generating mega-gees for
gravitic focusing have led many of us to suggest the "travelling annular
confinement grav pulse" theory, which requires some suspension of belief,
but less to me than focusing at the source.  And gravity is a _foolish_
force to use for fusion reactors: electromagnetism is far, far stronger,
and thus probably more practical.

But gravitic control of this magnitude would be expected to have
_significant_ effects for other technology, weapons, etc., which we don\'t
see in Traveller "canon" as it is currently constituted.  So I think it\'s
a bad idea to "hang" too many ideas and technologies off of pure gravitics.

Beats me. But no one seems to be objecting _too_ loudly. There _is_ a T2K
mailing list, albeit not as active as this one. Perhaps those interested

No kidding. It was supposed to be bleak. You are thousands of miles from

but I _like_ hot water and indoor toilets.

Maybe not. But what would you have said had we said that within 10 years of
the game\'s publication, the USSR would be no more, the Berlin Wall would be
gone, and a MacDonalds would open in Moscow (Oh...and Poland will petition to

Which is why I treat "Jump" as an "effect", not a space. As I noted
previously, the Jump drive creates an artifical gravitational signiture that
causes the ship to displace in space time. 

Intensity changes the distance displaced.

Other, intense gravitational signitures may interfere with the effect, but
nothing less than a stellar mass should have a chance. A planet will not
induce the effect to end early; a star might. Two equally valid mechanisms
when jump is treated as an effect is 1) Stars can not be jumped \'thru\' or 2)
any star of less than a neutron star\'s mass or a Black Hole will not effect
a jump. Using the first mechanism means that a jump-1 main is traversable
only at jump-1 unless it has folds across which to cut. It creates many new
choke points, slows travel and communications. More places for conflict; you
can\'t always bypass the problem.  Mechanism 2 opens the travel speed;
enables bypassing of trouble spots, but does enable the referee to throw in
a glitch by dropping in a black hole or neutron star where the story needs.

Which you elect to use will depend on what your background story is like.

Based on the first magazine holder on the Dragon shelf. There are some
others after that, and probably some before #35, but my collection is rather
spotty prior to that.

Some of the articles I have run across in the Dragon were even by Marc Miller.

(the following was copied from personal e-mail)

This is one of those quickie posts that will teach you something new
about the game.  Our topic is skill levels.

- ----

What\'s the difference between a character with skill-1 and a character
with skill-2?  Why is a skill-5 so bad-ass anyway--it\'s only a couple of
points above a level three.



When we think about skill levels, I\'m not sure we realize just what one
little level will do for you.

As you move up the ladder of expertise, one level is an exponential
increase in effectiveness.  Success chances are multiplied for every
level change you make.

Let\'s look at one character.  We\'ll examine how well he will perform
over the range of skill levels.

Our boy has a Stat of 7, which is average for a human.

If he has no skill, he can attempt a default skill using just his stat. 
Here\'s what his success chance will be over the range of difficulty
codes.

When you are looking at the analysis below, think of the skills your
character has.  This will put you in the right frame of mind as you
figure how much experience he has in a given area.

ANALYSIS SECTION:  SKILL LEVELS



1.  Stat-7    Skill-0

Easy      Average     Difficult     Formidable    Staggering   
Impossible
- ----
58%        16%         3%             0.3%            0.02%        
..003%


Analysis:
OK.  An averge guy starts out with a 60% chance on Easy tasks, and it
goes down hill real fast from there.  That just goes to show you.  You
need some experience in an area before you attempt to do anything more
than the easiest tasks.

Skill level 0, or default skills, is no real expertise in an area.  You
are relying on the little bits an pieces of info and experiences you\'ve
obtained over the years.  Normally, this doesn\'t add up to more than

Let\'s move on to skill-1 and see the jumps that are made.



2.  Stat-7    Skill-1

Easy      Average     Difficult     Formidable    Staggering   
Impossible
- ----
92%        50%         16%             3%            .5%         .04%


Analysis:
Whao!  Look at that.  You get a skill in an area, and look at how your
chances just jump up on the low end.  You\'ve almost got a 100% chance
with Easy tasks.  Average endeavors jump up from a measley 16% to a
50-50 proposition.  And, for the first time, you have a little bit of a
shot at Difficult tasks. Anything above Difficult, though, you still
don\'t have a hope in hell of getting.

Skill level one means your character has received some basic training in
the area.  He knows enough to do Easy tasks and is fairly competent with
Average ones.  He can even try Difficult tasks, but he fails a lot with
this.  Formidable and above tasks are usually out of the question. 



3.  Stat-7    Skill-2

Easy      Average     Difficult     Formidable    Staggering   
Impossible
- ----
100%        84%         44%             15%            4%         1%


Analysis:
Well, look at that.  For the first time, our character has a chance,
however slim, across the board.  Easy tasks are bumbed to 100%.  Since
there is no Spectacular Failure possible with Easy tasks, Level-2 makes
them automatic.  We are also damn good with Average tasks--there\'s only
a 16% chance of failure there.  Difficult tasks come up as a viable
alternative with almost a 50-50 shot.  And, we still have some chance at
Formidable, Staggering, and even Impossible tasks.

Skill level two is intermediate training.  A Medical-2 skill would mean
training as a nurse or a paramedic.  Administration-2 means that you
have graduated from being a junior clerk (level-1) to a competent, fully
trained clerk.  Pistol-2 means that you\'ve done more than just taken a
class on beginning firearms--you\'ve actually gone to the range,
practiced, and how you are getting competent with the weapon.



4.  Stat-7    Skill-3

Easy      Average     Difficult     Formidable    Staggering   
Impossible
- ----
100%        98%         76%             40%            14%         4%


Analysis:
Level three means that you have reached the professionl level of
compentency in this specific area.  Doctors get their MD\'s at level 3. 
Business professionals will have a level three in their area of
specialization--Administration-3, Liason-3, Broker-3, Trader-3.

Easy tasks are no problem and neither are Average tasks.  You\'ve got a 3
in 4 chance of completing Difficult tasks, and Formidable tasks have
jumped from 15% to 40%.  For the first time, there is a real chance at
rolling a Staggering task, although the success rate is small, and
Impossible rolls are even possible--however unlikely.



5.  Stat-7    Skill-4

Easy      Average     Difficult     Formidable    Staggering   
Impossible
- ----
100%        100%         95%             70%            36%         14%


Analysis:
Level four is a major break through.  This guy is truly talented in the
area, and this is where the guy has a real shot at the harder tasks. 
Easy and Average rolls are automatic.  Difficult throws are just about
automatic-a 5% chance of failure.  Formidable rolls,even, have a great
chance of success at 70%.

Heck, even Staggering tasks have a 1 in 3 shot,and for the first time,
Impossible success has a decent shot of making it.

Skill-4 skills are the realm of the truly gifted.  This would be the
person who\'s studied the subject in depth and practiced hard.  He\'s good
at what he does, and most people can\'t match him.  The professional who
has been specializing in a certain area for a long time can be
considered a level 4.

People who are considered experts in their fields are characters with
level-4 skills.



6.  Stat-7    Skill-5

Easy      Average     Difficult     Formidable    Staggering   
Impossible
- ----
100%        100%         100%             90%        64%           33%


Analysis:
The truly gifted have level-5 skills.  Easy, Average, and Difficult
tasks are no problem at all.  Formidable tasks, even, will succeed 90%
of the time.  Staggering is at 64%, and Impossible throws are at a
whopping 1 in 3 chance of success.

Characters with level-5 skills are the people that the experts turn to
for advice.  These are the people that are at the pinnacle of their
careers.  If you go up against a person with a level-5 skill, you\'d
better watch out, because he\'ll probably eat you for lunch.



7.  Stat-7    Skill-6

Easy      Average     Difficult     Formidable    Staggering   
Impossible
- ----
100%        100%         100%          98%            86%           59%


Analysis:
People with level-6 skills are very rare individuals.  They are the best
of the best, the cream of the crop.  They are the people that the rest
of us look at in awe.

Just about any skill attempt is not a problem for them.  Easy, Average,
Difficult, and Formidable tasks are just about automatic.  Staggering
tasks are almost 90%.  Even Impossible tasks are 6 in 10.

These guys are the best--the people we aspire to be but probably never
will.  They are the rare individuals who really make it, and their
proficiency in their specialty aread humbles all around who look at
them.

I was thinking...what if when they settled it, they put grav plates into
all the buildings?  That way, when you are at work or home, you can be
in a 1G field (or something stronger than .272 G).  Then, when you are
outside, you can jump around in the .272 gravity.

I could see something like this happening.  When the colonists settled
the planet, they didn\'t want to have all of the problems that are
associated with living in a low-G environment.  Looking ahead, they did
what they could to hedge the problem.

This way, a Zilan spends most of his life, or a big portion of it, in
the standard 1 G field.  Going off planet is not a problem, or as much
of a problem, as it could be.

Zila\'s TL is TL 7, so I\'ll have to jiggle the tech in this specific area
a little bit, but the first settlers did come to the planet in the first
place.  They had the tech then.  Maybe they kept up grav-field
technology out of everyday necessity.

I can see the brouchures now.  "Come to beautiful Zila--where you can
get a good night\'s sleep in our veritble garden of eden, jump around in
our natural low-G parks, and avoid all of the health risks associated
with long term exposure to other low-G planets."

Cool.  That gives me wonderful ideas for this definitely alien world.

I try to avoid every place the PC\'s go,it is just a high tech (or even
low tech) version of earth.  Spending time like this on the details of a
world usually makes it all worth it when everyone is leaving, talking
about how vivid I made the game that night.

I read a story once, in one of the mags, of how people at GDW used to
get flak about impossible worlds being the way the random dice had
generated them.  The author of the story, I forget who, but I think it
was a GDW regular, told about how much fun they used to have at GDW\'s
main office, talking about different worlds.

Instead of bitching that something did not seem realistic, they let
their imaginations go and tried to discover what circumstances led to
the planet being the way it is.

I think this is facinating and quite fun.  Zila has been a project, and
now it is going to be an adventure.

It\'s going to be fun.  I can\'t wait until they get there.

I\'ve struggled with this aspect of the game for a while, so I would like
some input.  I\'ve a couple of theories...

  Each planet is responsible for contributing towards Sector (Imperial)
and SubSector (Colonial) units.  Imperial personell are primarily drawn
from the hi-tech worlds in a subsector (easier and cheaper to train them
to the appropriate levels), while experienced non-comms and officers from
the Colonial units may transfer up.

  - or -

  Each planet contributes to the construction, maintenance and manning of
military units in keeping with it\'s economic potential.  These units, once
manned, are \'Imperialized\', and will serve a set term at the discretion of
the Sector Military structure (made up of Imperial Nobles).  Once the term
of service is complete, the unit is returned to the individual worlds for
such maintenance and recruiting of personnel as required before it\'s next
period of service.  

With the first method, personnel would be scattered, which would prevent
the possibility interworld politics spilling over into the Imperial
Military at more than a personal level.  (Imagine this "From the TNS - the
crew of the Dreadnaught ISS Tigress mutinied today in response to economic
sanctions on their world by...)  However, it does present the problem of
getting these millions of individuals back to their homes of record - no
small cost that!

With the second method, units are tied more directly to their homeworlds -
with the attendant problems, but personnel costs are also shifted back to
the homeworlds.

There\'s a difference between the referee being tipped to the occurance of
clans where females control the clan politics (because a certain patriarch
is a ninny and his wives happen to lack a natural feminine interest in
finance and machinery, for example), and having an such female-dominated
clans be overtly institutionalized in society, which is what it sounded
like Marc was proposing.

The trick with Aslan politics and society is that, IIUC, it\'s wholly based
on kinship ties (whether "real" or fictive) -- whereas most of those "weird
government types and social communities" among you^h^h^h us humans are
based on more abstracted ideological differences.  Access to power is
contestable in any sort of setup, but access to the sources of legitimacy
in a kinship-based political system is much more restricted.  If you make
exceptions like this to the patrilineal, patriarchal system of clan and
inter-clan governance, it\'s going to have a massive ripple-down effect to
the level of kinship and, er, "family values".

The way I see it is, female-dominated clans should be about as common as
Imperial megacorporations whose stated mission is to minimize their stock
value and assets while permanently alienating their customer base through
false advertising and random chemical/biological warfare, and to embezzle
multiple teracredits from the Emperor\'s Privy Purse to give away to their
competitors. (So yeah, they exist <G>)

Why would normal clans deal with the glaring liability of a clan run by
females -- who as everyone knows, simply don\'t have the mental capacity to
handle big important geopolitical topics and diplomacy and whatnot?  What
male clanmember would be willing to negotiate with a female of another
clan, as a peer?  Who would be willing to be vassal of such an ill-fated
bunch of freaks?  Who would tolerate this sort of disorder in his clients?
What pussy-whippped male could show his face in front of Aslan of other
clans, where men are men and women go off and do... well, whatever it is
they do, the way they\'re supposed to?  What would old rival clans and new
competition do?  After all, eveyrone also knows that females can\'t figure
out military stuff to save their pretty little heads, right?  Bang!

One way to look at the Aslan clan is as a machine for producing
geneological continuity; at the same time, it\'s a machine for taking that
strictly ranked, consanguinous geneological fabric and stretching it,
through affinal relationships and bonds of fictive kinship, to connect
different clans and create "society" in the strict sense.

The "female-dominant clan" [hmm, a kink-positive new supplement for White
Wolf Games, perhaps?] is maybe the Aslan "corporation", which IIRC can be
semi-independent of their clans-of-CEO-origin, or in some cases truly
clan-independent.  This I see as being a like the much-touted transnational
megacorporation, but more so -- the chief difference, besides the fur,
being that the separation is based on a reified male/female dichotomy
within a kinship network, rather than a public/private enterprise dichotomy
in an international system.

>If I could make one suggestion for new material on the Alsan, it would be
>to play up their individualism and the mercantile aspects of their society.
>This would add depth to Aslan society and make them seem less like
>"Klingons in fur".

As folks on the TravLang list migh attest, I\'m an avowed Klingon-basher
myself... I think the biggest step towards deKlingonizing the Aslan would
be to get rid of the dueling folderol.. which isn\'t likely to happen, and I
can see why <G>.  The next best thing might be to emphaize the ritual
nature of elite male Aslan warriordom:  intensely long-winded and boastful,
fussy about ornamental trifles, neurotic over points of precedence and rank
privilege, and totally ineffectual as a military force in human terms.
"Yes, I know it\'s low tide now, but we promised the enemy we\'d stage a
landing today, and we had to wait for them to finish setting up their gun
emplacements... it wouldn\'t be a fair match otherwise, would it?" Etc.

Please excuse my incoherency... accountancy by day, pop sociology by night
doesn\'t mix so well.

Canadians?  Last time I checked, Canada\'s main contribution was to

As far as their ground combat capability goes, I\'m not impressed.  I 
don\'t know much about their navy.  And their Air Force, well, Mirages 
have the reputation as being the aircraft to buy if your politics 
aren\'t in line with the US sufficiently to be able to wrange F-16s.  
But their ground forces are more designed with neo-colonial 
interventions against lightly armed primitives in mind than with a good 
solid stand-up fight.  I mean look at the AMX-30!  I mean, yeah, the 
LeClerc is a solid tank, but it\'s ten years too late.  By the time they 
get that into every line unit, the US will have everyone up M1A2 
standard.  And their best troops don\'t drive tanks, anyway.  They drive 
armored cars.

Depends on when you are talking about.  In 1939, no.  Was small.  In 
1940, we see massive expansion, but the weapons don\'t keep up 
initially.  By 1941, weapons were catching up and wooden dummies aren\'t 
needed anymore.

You don\'t need that much skill to hit someone with an automatic weapon. 
 Partisan units have formed frequently among populations which have no 
prior training of a military nature.  Parisian citizens form Maquis, 
Ukranian peasants form entire partisan divisions, etc.  And any 
survivors from the local National Guard unit provide a cadre of trained 
leadership.

What, so Hispanics wouldn\'t fight for the US?  My (Hispanic from Los

Half an hour from launch to impact in Midwest.  Less to hit targets near Canadian border.

Hmm. . . Ten divisions, four are light, rest have five batallions of 
tanks, five times 6 is 30, 30x58 is not quite 1800.  Plus a handful of 
National Guard units are using them now. . .  I don\'t think your

nuclear war, but let\'s not get carried away.

  1) It was suggested that the referee _may_ be right, which was not the

     even having/being able to argue computer scientists, Stempel guarantees
     the referee from being wrong.

  2) You can load all the fractal-based "phage" programs up on any UNIX box

     _known_ for getting \'su\' on boxes I can\'t even log on to. :)

  3) Copy "protection" is a bogus thing of the past.  It is too effective,
     and since it is generally a free market, those without site licensing
     schemes lose out to companies that have better, less hassled systems
     for keeping managers out of the piracy zone.  Those same managers and
     companies cause us system admins a lot of problems through these 
     techniques, and I guarantee you that _we_ find ways around them.

  4) Personally, I think it _is_ better to discuss this in the realm of
     vagueries for Traveller simply because it is all still evolving so
     fast, and then there is also that little problem of Einstein, but
     then again, our jump drives do get him too. :)

BTW, I have _not_ implemented Stempel in my campaign, but it will probably
show up as an alien, and therefore superior architecture.

There\'s a lot of stupidity out there. Many gun control laws seem really

rifle. Guns with bayonet mounts are outlawed----as if there has been a rash 
of bayonettings! Then, when the bayonet lugs are removed, people get 
outraged when they see that it\'s really the same gun. You\'d think they\'d

Thruster plates are most definitely *not* "artificial gravity". If they
were, you wouldn\'t *need* compensation, as gravity works on every
particle equally. You\'d seem to be in free fall, same as falling into a
*real* gravity field.

So we are stuck with compensators and the ship\'s gravity as the only
artificial gravity type generators.

There *is* a difference between having a relatively intact SCUD (at
high terminal velocity) hit, and a bunch of *pieces* of one (at low
terminal velocity). And any sort of impact between a Patriot and a SCUD
*will* result in pieces. In fact, they discovered that a lot of the
SCUDs were so inaccurate because they fell apart on their own.

Huh? MHD tends to be *smaller* than generators with equivalent power
output. It consists of what amounts to a jet nozzle, an electrode on
either side of the plasma flow, and a magnetic field at right angles to
the flow.

I think that you are confusing MHD generators with JxB *pumps*. The
pumps are frequently used in reactors that use a liquid metal for
coolant, because they allow a sealed coolant loop.

Ok, that I\'ll grant you.

This is not so easy. The inverse-square law is a consequence of
*geometry*. You can get a field that drops off more *slowly* by
limiting the radiation to part of a sphere. But you can\'t have it cover
*more* than a sphere. So inverse square drop-off is the *limit*, you
can\'t get it to drop off faster.

ps. I finally found the formula for the gravity field of a flat plate,
so when I get a chance, I can work up what sort of effects could be
expected around a ship.

I suggest you have a talk with your local civil defense co-ordinator.
Most large cities in the US *cannot* be evacuated. There\'s not enough
transport capacity, there\'s no place to house the people outside the
city, and the infrastructure for keeping them fed isn\'t there.

Sorry, but they have no more supplies than they expect to use before
the next shipment gets there. And the shipments are *frequent*. Why?
Because they have to pay *taxes* on "inventory". Also, it costs money
to store stuff. Thus the "just in time" delivery method arose.

Where did you get *that* figure? There are published reports showing
that the "strategic oil reserves" aren\'t big enough to be of much help.
And since they are reserves of *crude* oil, you need refineries to turn
them into fuel. Likewise you need transport to get the crude to the
refineries, and the refined fuel to where it is needed.

In short, in all three of your above objections, you show a complete
ignorance of the realities of logistics.

You must be talking about a different US. We have *one* anti-missile
installation. That\'s all the ABM treaty allows us. It\'s in North
Dakota, protecting some ICBM silos. The Russian one is protecting
Moscow. 

There has been a lot of talk about spaceborne anti-missile systems. We
have *none* that are anything beyond designs on paper. We\'ve done
*research*, but even that was over protests by the Soviets that we were
violating the treaty. 

We do have a few *anti-satellite* weapons. But those require more lead
time than a missile attack would give, and they require orbital data
that we wouldn\'t be able to get before the warhead impacted.

ps. I\'m all *too* familiar with the civil defense issues. Back in the
70s and 80s I and some of my friends were trying to figure out just
what we could do to save our asses if there was a war. You see, I live
in a major target area. Deep water port, shipyards, major rail
terminal, major airport (including an Air National Guard base), and
surrounded by hi-tech industries that an enemy would rather not have
working. 

The only way to get out is to leave well before the *rest* of the
population decides to, or to have something that isn\'t stopped by
traffic jams and roadblocks. And you have to have someplace to go *to*.
Someplace that can provide food and shelter *without* outside help, and
for a *long* time. And it\'d better have a fallout shelter...

Sure, it\'s impossible to be 100% secure. But my point was that unless

The much maligned TRS-DOS. 7 levels of protection for files, with two
seperate passwords with different access levels possible (that\'s two
passwords per file!). And you could set the number of backup copies of
a file possible. Anytime you copied a disk with backup limited files,
the copies would have the limit set to 0 (ie, no copies), and the disk
you copied from would have the counter decremented.

<loud laughter>. Easy. TRS-DOS started out as an OS for *business* use,
with home use a secondary consideration. MS-DOS was the exact opposite,
and had to be "CP/M compatible" (that was one of IBM\'s "requirements").

I suggest that you have never worked with mainframe OSes or even OSes
like Novell Netware. 

I was *shocked* when I started using MS-DOS and found out that it had
*no* file security whatsoever. Hell, even Unix has file access
permissions.

Nope, not bad sectors. Just ones that the OS wouldn\'t let user programs
get at. So you had to bypass the OS and talk directly to the floppy
controller. As I noted, on CPU\'s with hardware protection, you can only
talk directly to the hardware *if* you are the OS.

Not necessarily true! The curvature of N-space can warp J-space without
the reverse being true. It\'s possible that mass doesn\'t curve J-space.
In which case there\'s no corresponding warpage to feed back to N-space.

Two problems. First, that array will have to be a *lot* more than
"hundreds" of kilometers on a side. Consider the possible course lines,
given various start and end points in the two systems. Just between the
two mainworlds givens you a spread of courselines as wide as their
orbits (a couple of AU, ie about 300 *million* kilometers). Second, not
only do you have to position the array *very* carefully, but every
sensor has to have the same velocity. And that velocity has to be such
that the array will *stay* between the systems, in spite of their
relative motions.

Next, if the gravity from an object in J-space affects N-space, you
have this gravity well going past at FTL speeds. Since gravity
*propogates* at the speed of light, things get a bit weird here...

BTW, what good does it do you to detect the ships when you can\'t get
the info anywhere *before* the ship gets there?

Excuse me? The only reason things are 2-d in the game (which *includes*
N-space!) is because 3d maps are *way* too much trouble.

First thing, you\'ll need one *hell* of a grav emitter. Second, you\'ve
got to get it close to the ship\'s course (gee, how\'d you know about it
in advance?) and finally, how do you get the message to the array
before the ship goes by?

Assuming that gravity *in* jumpspace has any effects *on* jumpspace.

And they all depend on some *assumptions* regarding gravity *in*

Again, j-space *isn\'t* 2-d.

  Then it would be up to those Los Angeles-class subs to take care of
things.  Failing that, you would have the ASW units, some of those old
modified Essex-class carriers that could be recommisioned, and of course
numerous other mothballed vessels including *real* battleships.  I don\'t

   Their forte seems to be tactical nukes.  I\'m not sure how many
neutron weapons they have in their arsenal, but its probably no small
number.  Naturally these are pointed at targets in western *Germany*.

>Seriously, any nuclear
>power is going to threaten the US more with nuclear guerilla(*) warfare.

   One would assume that the French wouldn\'t one day just decide to park
a freighter in New York Harbor to set off a tac nuke.  There would be a
period of strained relations and eventually threats and a break in those
relations before any attack would occur.  Even the Japanese gave every
indication that they were going to strike against *somebody* in late
1941 or early 1942, even if American intelligence was too disjointed and
bureaucratic to figure out that Pearl Harbor was to be the target.  It
would be a rather difficult thing to pull off.

   I don\'t even want to get into what would happen to France afterwards
<shutter>.

   BTW, the whole 2300 scenario is similar to the global situation c.
1890, except that instead of the British Empire being rather dominant,
its the French.  The Americans in that era were just beginning to emerge
as a world power and had to settle for everyone else\'s leftovers when it
came to colonies (the Philippines, Puerto Rico, etc. weren\'t added until
1898 and were seized from Spain).  Ditto Germany, which was only
recently united.

????!??!??!??!
Er excuse me, a metre is a set measurement! (it\'s measured off a bar of
something they\'ve got stored in France) Therefore a cubic metre is always
the same size of material no matter what the material is. The only
confusing FF&S (and other Traveller design systems) measurement is between
ton and tonne, where one is displacement in hydrogen and the other is
weight in 1000\'s of kg\'s (I can\'t remember which is which though). 

Traveller used the metric system because it is sooo much easier to convert
between metres, kilograms, litres and watts and their various multiples,
rather than feet, pounds, (the thing you use for volume & energy) etc.. 

But yes, MT starship combat did reek (I\'ve never seen CT\'s so I can\'t
compare but I have got MT, TNE & Brillant Lances). MT combat was
\'incomplete\' in my opinion (but I have worked out a better system), and
design could be a little confusing if you didn\'t have the errata - So
that\'s why I switched to TNE.

TNE does everything more thoroughly and consistently than MT and has the 
clearest layout of them all, the only problem being is that you have to
halve a PC\'s hit capacity to make them realistically killable (ah well,
you can\'t get everything right).

Brilliant Lances works pretty damn well in my opinion - a tad on the
complex side of course :) Striker II\'s great (Don\'t get me started on how 
much Games Workshop\'s current miniature systems suck) and can be bent into
any scale too... 


I\'m never going to buy T4 rulebooks (I might buy Milieu books though)
because:
 	a)It\'s too expensive compared to other systems (and the amount I
                                                       paid for MT & TNE)

	b)It\'s has more bugs than ever before

	c)Combat is too simple for my tastes (TNE being my limits of
					      preferred complexity)

	d)Why buy Traveller all over again? Do you want me to throw away
          all my old books (don\'t answer that)?!??! 

TNE\'s FF&S is more flexible and compact than any other Traveller system so
far. FF&S2 doesn\'t even cover all the old FF&S stuff! So much for the 
all-singing all-dancing T4, which changes it\'s rules, repeats itself and
generally forces you to buy 3 or 4 books just for all the design rules.

And if you think TNE was a canon breaker, wait till you see what GURPS
does to your beloved craft, characters and combat situations... :P

Imperium Games would have made more money republishing Classic 
Traveller (How many of you out there would die for some of the rare CT
stuff...) since it seems to be the only system that everyone respects...

Cannonically in TNE charecters from a planet with a gravity of 0.2 or
less subtracted 2 from Strength and Constitution (what other versions or
Traveller call Endurance).  If from a gravity of greater than 0.2 but
less than 0.5 subtract 1 from Str and Con.

This may be the correct medical answer but it is not the correct
_Traveller_ answer.  Many player charecters are going to be from low
gravity planets, how badly do you want to screw over their players in
the name of accuracy ?

Even if they have been their for millenia, if they are human beings,
they have had hundreds of millions of years worth of ancestors (starting
with the first amphibians) who have adapted to 1.00 g, don\'t you think
this is an important factor ?

My understanding was that as gravity decreased your ability to jump
increases as the square root of the gravity.  Thus in a gravity of 0.272
you would only be able to move your center of mass 1.92 times as far as
in 1 gravity.

The key to it is if buisinesses maximize profits, then if they *can* raise
prices, they do. Rising real wages would therefore leave prices at the
level they would otherwise have reached (becasue if businesses maximize
profits, if they can raise prices without losing net revenue by lost sales,
they do raise prices, and if they cant they dont). It may have effects on
the rate of profit or on output (as businesses go broke due to higher wage
costs), but it wont have effects on prices.

Of course, if businesses act by aiming at a target rate of profits, and
then slacking off when they get there, we are in a swamp without a map,
and any damn thing can happen.

(PS if other people can geek about American gingoism and T2000, we can

due to tech change [the payoff from all that investment in PCs] or part
of a Ponzi scheme based on the wealth affect from rising stock prices
boosting consumption, which keeps output high and boosts profits, thus
helping raise stock prices ?)

Not quite true. I\'d need to check my sources (the best one a shipping 
register for one of the Dutch ports for ships to and from the East Indies 
between about 1600 and about 1700 ... it\'s in Dutch, which is liveable, 
and 250 miles away in Sydney, which isnt), but Free Traders as we know and
love had a pretty big presence ... from memory, about half of the ships
going to the East Indies from Holland were Jan Compagnie (the Dutch East
Indies Company - arguably the first of the MegaCorporations), and half
were independant efforts. The stuff in Braudel\'s Meditteranean in the
Time of Phillip II seems to support Free Traders as a viable form of 
trade (but not the only form of trade. Again, I\'d have to go back to my
sources if called, but the Spanish in the Carribbean began to ammass
their trading ships in big convoys once pirates became a problem, even
for inter-island trade. Of course, this made the settlers more willing
to trade with the pirate/trader who was here now, rather than wait a month
for the convoy). The "commenda" contract also has a long history ... I
put up the money, and you put your ass on the line doing the actual travel
and trading, and we split the profits down the middle. Hmmm, if starship
crews get Cr36000 a year, call the rate of interest 5%, so a crewmember 
is worth Cr720 000 in rough numbers ... hmmm. Given the difference a 
good pilot or gunner makes in most rules systems, I think skilled crew
will be able to negotiate a lot better than a 10% per skill level bonus.
In seriously dangerous areas, a good starship gunner could ask for up
to 1% of the ships value per jump ... after all, one laser hit a hotshot
gunner could have put sand in front of could cost you megacredits in
repair bills.

Secondly, to me unorganized buyers and sellers and signifigant
transactional hazards
sounds just like long-distance trade between centers months apart. My view
is that Free Traders would be involved in long-haul trade, where the lag
time of a week in each port to find buyers is less signifigant. The
Megacorporations
run a blue crew/gold crew arrangement (land, refuel, load cargo, change crew, 
leave ... I think you could cut turnaround in port to under 8 hours,
assuming maintainence is not due).

Anyway, taking cargo across a sector seems more heroic and adventurous than
doing short-haul runs along a main, and thus should be encouraged.

Thirdly, there are always going to be corrupt corporate or other officials
who want a cargo moved with no paperwork, or who need something to go
*now* rather than in four days when the mail truck leaves.

This might be true, but it doesnt feel Trav ... although I am reminded 
about George Orwell\'s essay about when Whitehall began to run India by
telegraph. This is, I think, the way things work in the staid, settled
areas of the Imperium (ie nowhere in M0, most everywhere by 1100).

Oh, and I dont believe in Subsidized Merchants per se (although, given
bureaucracy and politics, all things are possible. Look at the American
CVBG groups ... a solution
looking for a problem). It is simpler just to offer cut rates on fuel or
maintainence (they are goanna carry cargo to and from the maintainence depot).
More likely is bounties on cargo carried (a negative tax of, say, Cr100 per
displacement
ton) or on the industries that make the goods (it\'s a lot harder to steal a
ruby
polishing facility).

As you can probably tell issue #51 was a special Traveller issue.

This listing does not include reviews, or any articles published after
issue #112 (I am not aware of any), otherwise it should be complete
unless the articles compilers (Jean & Wally Black, Kim Mohan - Editor)
made an error.	

Can anyone tell me if there is a list anywhere of all Traveller Articles
in _all_ gaming magazines ?

looking chickens.  Chickens were chosen because they are structurally
similar to humans in that they have two load-bearing limbs (legs) and
two non-load bearing limbs (wings).  I don\'t believe that these chickens

This experiment was writen up as a chapter of a book called _Great

for true evolution to take place.  I think what was seen was the
response of an ordinary chicken to high-G.  Taking this to Traveller,
new colonists on a high-G world would look like muscled dwarfs.
After enough time, or genetic engineering, they might end up lightly
muscled as has been suggested on the list.

Hmmm... an Imperial ocupation force consists of two armies drawn from
Imperial member worlds. But the beaucracy has forgotten that these member
worlds frequently clashed militarily before joining, and still fight
economically (and in secret, with commando raids and other nasties)
afterward. 

The world being occupied/annexed is amzed when the two Imperial armies,
after a "friendly fire" incident, start slugging it out with each other.

The players just happen to be in the starport when the fighting starts.

If you want to read how a "mistake" like this can proceed, read Tom
Clancy\'s "Sum of all fears". When the same sort of thing happens to Soviet
and US forces in Berlin, just after the wall came down!

What about using ground-based lasers to lift small cargo ship into low earth

Hmmm, I thought I had all my tables fixed but I never noticed that one!

Vehicles in MT are pretty poorly supported anyway - but my suggestion is:
count anything non-paved as \'off-road\' and use the vehicles off road
speed unless the terrain is bloody hard to cross in a vehicle (I designed
a Battletech style mech to overcome this and the players loved it).

The major glitchette about vehicles is working out a suitable modifier for
shooting at high speed targets, because using personal combat rules the
modifier runs into a wall at -8 dm, therefore making most vehicles all
impose a -8 on personnel shooting (This is all from memory guys) at them.
TNE fixes this problem but it\'s not really workable into MT as it is based
on Diff Level Mods and d20\'s.

I have the 1st sep 1990 errata and it is still missing grenade prices (ask
me for these, I have a list) and some space travel info (turned up in
Referee\'s Companion - I also have this, ask me for the info too)

    twilight2000@MPGN.COM/twilight2000-digest@MPGN.COM

To switch to a digest from a normal distribution (or vice versa),
simply subscribe to the new list and unsubscribe from the old list by
sending mail to majordomo@MPGN.COM.  For example, suppose you are
subscribed to twilight2000@MPGN.COM and want to switch to a digest, you
would send a mail message to majordomo@MPGN.COM with the following in
the body:

        subscribe twilight2000-digest
        unsubscribe twilight2000

Archives of the digests will be made available on the MPG-Net Gaming
Archive in the directory /Gaming/Twilight2000.  Simply ftp to
ftp.MPGN.COM, log on as \'ftp\' or \'anonymous\', give your e-mail address
as the password and start downloading.  Alternately, you can retrieve
message digests by sending commands in an e-mail message to
Majordomo@MPGN.COM.  For help in this process, send a mail message
with \'help\' as the body to Majordomo@MPGN.COM.

If you have difficulties with the FTP archive, please send mail to
ftp-maint@MPGN.COM and the maintainers will be happy to help.  Also,
if you are having difficulties with the Twilight 2000 mailing lists, you
can send mail to either twilight2000-request@MPGN.COM and I will assist.

Sorry to disapoint you \'old boy\' ... but the Americans didn\'t give us a
jot of help untill we managed to detonante a nuclear device off the 
cost of Australia, and then a thermal nuclear device off bikkini
island. The US then thought that a rekindalling of the \'special arangment\'
was a good idear as \'old blighty\' became a nuclear player.

Yes, a 10-30% die back may not be "unreasonable" -- but it isn\'t canon! In fact,
the figures that we have directly contradict it!

>Terran intervention. The problem with this, is the level of intervention is

<much on intervention snipped>

However, you are making an assumption that is unwarranted -- or, at least,
*perhaps* unwarranted. And that is, quite simply, that 100% of the Vilani
populace of the ZS will be exposed to the diseases. Remember that most diseases
are actually fairly difficult to get -- the methods of transmission require
fairly close proximity, contaminated food and/or water supplies and the like and
these can be controlled much more simply (and would have had to have been even
on Vland -- as the food that the Vilani eat had to be preserved, at the very
least; elsewhere, contamination, though a lesser problem, would exist).

In other words, a disease like Ebola is something like 95% fatal -- however,
this does *not* mean that 95% of a region\'s population is killed by it! It
simply means that the few poor bastards who contract it have a 95% or greater
chance of dying from it.

So, the Vilani and other minor human races have some protection right from the
start.

Anyhow, and correct me if I\'m wrong, humans have no protection whatsoever
against Ebola -- none, nada, zip. zero, null -- and any survival seems to stem
from the strain weakening with each step in transmission from the index cases
rather than any enhanced T-cells or whatever. So even with a close to 100% kill
rate disease, the number that die yearly is, what, maybe a few score or less --
unless you have an "outbreak" of a few hundred? And that\'s achieved through
careful quarantine. I know its a stretch, but surely there is a good case to
understand that just because a Vilani would have close to a 30% chance of dying
in the face of infection by a Terran virus or bacteria, this doesn\'t mean that
30% of Vilani would die! Only 30% of those infected.

In other words, perhaps the PoD *did* have a 30% kill rate -- but only managed
to infect and kill less than 1% of the populace of the ZS?

But the Vilani have, of course, been exposed to non-Vilani environments for,
what, 3000 years before contact with Terra? They would have inevitably been
exposed to the dangers of those environs for the very reason that they are not
affected at home -- they had no concept of the dangers! This means that they
would have some immunity, some treatments, and a good idea of quarantine.

I don\'t see the objection -- surely there is no reason why a high tech culture
like that of the ZS would have any trouble producing the necessary equipment for
producing terran biochemicals if they were provided with the computer templates?
And we *know* that the Terrans have occupied ZS planets for many generations
before the final collapse, so they would be a) aware of the problem and, b) have
some idea of the magnitude of the needed solution and, c) have some plans and
stockpiles to deal with it.

Unless, of course, you are claiming that the TC and the RoM undertook a
deliberate policy of genocide by neglect? This doesn\'t make sense -- despite the
attitude of the US to Japan in 1941 (was it Halsey who said something along the
lines of "When this war is over, Japanese will be a language spoken only in
Hell."? they did not either actively or passively act to let the Japanese
populace die ... there would have been mass starvation in 1945/46 as the Rice
Crop had failed, so the US imported the food to keep the Japanese alive. They
did much the same in Germany. I cannot believe that the Terrans of the
Interstellar Wars would be so brutal -- we\'re even told that the reason for the
Colonials support of Estigaribbia\'s coup was their sympathetic attitude to the
poor treatment the TC government was allegedly going to impose on the Vilani.

No, sorry. Spanish Flu was *NOT* related to normal Flu viruses -- well, in
perhaps the same way that a Chimp is *our* relative ... they have a common
ancestor. But I wouldn\'t want to have a blood transfusion from Chimp blood,
thank you very much. The Spanish Flu was a mutant direct from Swine Flu, whereas
the Flu viruses that normally affect humans are several hundred thousand mutant
generations from a mutant from the Swine Flu ... at least two thousand years
ago. That\'s why, as I understand it, it was so devastating on an individual
basis.

And how long have these been symbionts (well, sort of) with humans? Does it go
back to the time before the Vilani were taken off by Grandfather?

So we must assume that TC and RoM precautions saved them? And boosted their
immune systems effectively to Terran levels -- after all, we are told that less
than 1% of their population died. And that *is* canon.

According to the MTrav "Referee\'s Companion", Antiviral vaccinations are TL10,
well below the peak pre RoM TL12/13 level achieved *before* they conquered the
ZS.

Easy. You follow the simple instructions from the Medical Expert program the TC
or RoM have provided to be downloaded into your medical database (Expert systems
are TL8). You use your automated factories to produce the antibiotics and
antivirals on a priority basis.

>So fairly soon the Vilani hospitals are bulging at the seams, beds in the

No. You are assuming that a disease with a Kill Rate of 30% will kill 30% of the
populace. This is not the case. There is no doubt that people will be affected,
but with minimal planning on part of the TC/RoM there will be no worse an affect
than the Spanish Flu -- 1.5% of Terran Population overall, but, in the case of
US troopships en route to Europe, in excess of 30% death rates and (IIRC) in
excess of 60% so severely incapacitated that it took them months to recover.

Perhaps I am being too optimistic, but I suspect that you are being too
pessimistic!

I still reckon that there is considerable evidence to suggest that the PoD was
hyped out of all proportion to its actual effect(s).

Fair enough, but you will note that I have cut most of the "crap" down to a very
short series of points and, anyway, I think that we\'ve all pretty much said what
we have to say.

Actually, I think that the "errors", whether errors or not, are quibbles and are
irrelevant to the base argument that the Vilani were supposedly more vulnerable
to Terran diseases, which is canon.

No, but even with two thousand years of improvement and catching up, racial
pureblood Vilani would still be more susceptible to Terran diseases in M0 and
even in MTrav or TNE, and there are no rules for this.

Read the rest, I\'m extrapolating back from FS figures. And, yes, population
could have expanded geometrically, but, historically, it hasn\'t ... and it tends
to balance out between societies that have large families and those that have
small ones.

Unless you are suggesting that the Terrans of the beginning of the Interstellar
Wars, presumably with c. 5-10 billion population based on current trends all on
one planet actually *outnumbered* the *entire* population of the ZS at that
time!

Extrapolating back to somewhere around 100-500 billion is exceedingly reasonable
as far as I can see it!

OK, so the death rate doubles from less than 1% to somewhere between less than
1% and something less than 2%. This is only just barely equal to the Spanish
Flu.

Exactly! That\'s what I\'m trying to get through! On *SOME* US troopships sent to
Europe the rate was in excess of 30% dead and (IIRC) 60% long term
convalescents. Still, it didn\'t stop the US sending off enough troops to get
most through *and*, of course, it isn\'t widely known even amongst historians of
the period today ... let alone being as widely known as the PoD is!

And, ergo, known only to a handful of historians. I can assure you that after 27
years of studying the WW1 period on and off at senior High School, Graduate
University, or Postrgraduate University level -- as well as teaching it on and
off to senior HS students for much of that time, while I was aware of the
Spanish Flu, it was *only* because of what my Father and Grandfather had told me
about it ... *not* because of any coverage it gets in standard texts on the war.
In many it is not even a footnote.

that the death rate from *all* the pathogens was somewhere between 1-2 billion.
How sure are you of your facts? In one paragraph you\'re saying one thing and two

Sure, but, like the effects of the Spanish Flu some eighty years later, it would
be forgotten in the general run of history -- an obscure footnote to an obscure
period. The importance attached to the PoD in Library Data implies all sorts of

Well, actually, does the fact that the PoD is mentioned in "Library Data" mean
that it is believed by "a lot of people"? Perhaps it is an obscure footnote that
is simply mentioned in passing in most of the "real" Library Data, but which has
been mentioned here for "local colour".

Anyway, remember that the Library Data of the MTrav period was manipulated by
Norris for his own ends! What could *Norris\'s* reason be for giving prominence
to such an obscure and debatable factoid? I would suggest that Norris probably
has some reason of his own -- perhaps to keep the Zho\'s scared off ... they look
longingly at taking the Marches during the chaos of the Civil War, but are
warned off by the subtle mention of a terrible Terran-originated Biowar weapon?
Seems like that is as good an explanation as any, and better than assuming some
of what i consider to be the ridiculous aspects of the PoD ... Norris has an
ulterior motive and has more or less created it out of whole cloth!

Yep, and (2) seems most likely. (1) is clearly ridiculous given the length of

I quit making this sort of index around issue 37 of the Dragon, so I

Folks have already mentioned "The Third World War" by Gen. Hackket.
There\'s also a sequel running around. I have it, but it\'s in storage.

Dean Ing wrote a series of three books that start with the above
"history" as background and go on with some more fighting and sneak
attacks etc. The first book is "Systemic Shock". I can\'t recall the
titles of the other two right now.

However, studies are showing that excess body fat carried around the
waist (as opposed to on the legs or buttocks) is not good for you, and
it isn\'t because of the extra mass. 

So extreme obesity is still going to cause heart trouble, even on low-g
worlds. 

BTW, it\'s not so much fluid *retention* as it is fluid redistribution.
In lower g (or during prolonged confinement to bed) fluids no longer
accumulate in the lower body, they tend to distribute more evenly. This
leads to things like stuffy noses and heads. It also leads to fluid
*loss* as the body\'s regulator for fluid content is in the head, so it
gets rid of what it *thinks* is "excess" fluid. So you actually wind up
with *less* fluid (Shuttle astronauts lose a couple of liters over the
course of the first couple of days, and drink like fish when they get
back to gravity!)

It\'s like this. Object radiate energy that depends on their
temperature. There\'s a spread of wavelength, but with a *very*
pronounced "peak". 

At 3 K, the radiation peaks in the microwave band. At 800 K it peaks in
the red area of the visible spectrum (red-hot). At 6000 K, it peaks in
the yellow  (surface of the sun). At a few million K, it peaks well
into the gamma ray range, and the IR component is essentially nil.

It\'s happened in games. Some idiot manages to breach the main L-Hyd
feed line and quick freezes everybody in the compartment. The automatic
safeties cut the flow, and seal the hatch. After the crew killed the
boarders in the rest of the ship, they carefully opened the hatch (the
automatic systems have purged the hydrogen from the air in the
compartment by then). They see a bunch of frozen statues, with a nice
coating of ice. One player poked at one of them, and it fell over and
*shattered*. He got assigned cleanup detail for that stupid move.

Not exactly. They will still have the *potential* to be as strong as
the players. Just like you or I had the potential to build our bodies
to match Arnold Schawrzenagger. But in both cases it\'d take a lot of
*hard* work to reach that potential.

Also, since things still have the same *mass* even though they weigh
less, that means that it\'s just as hard to push or pull something. So
they won\'t be utter weaklings, just "wimps".

It\'s *not* a problem to live there. It\'s going to someplace with higher
gravity that\'s a pain. Think of it as being like visting Peru. You\'ll
need a *lot* of acclimitization before you can move around without
being short of breath. But you can do it. You won\'t be as good as the
folks born there, but you can survive. Or at least many folks can. Some
*can\'t* adjust.

> I need a handwave, a head thought, something to feel better about this.

The folks who live there, like 99.9% of the people on *most* planets,
never leave the place. The few who do, have worked long and hard to get
ready for it (Think of how you\'d feel about visting a 2g world).

Third World War was basically Hackket\'s plee to change NATO, and the
nuclear exchange is basically a dias ex machina <sp> to end the book
(from what I remember only Minsk and Birmimham get nuked).

One excellant book on a post nuke world is of course David Brin\'s "The
Postman", I\'m suprised nobodies mentioned it before (p\'haps its cos of
GURPS: uplift wars :*) ). Not only is it a darn good read, but it
provides an excellant backdrop and future timeline for a T2K world.

	Yikes :).  That sounds really, um, painful...  One can just
visualize the looks of horror of customers on both sides of an inadvertent
mislabelling mishap...

	Could lead to entire units getting disbanded over rumours of sexual
depravity following desperate last stands: "They repelled that Zhodani
Consular Guard unit hand to hand using _*WHAT*_?!".

	And as far as the Zho are concerned, just imagine what they\'d start
thinking of the 3I after that little incident; add unspeakable perversity

  Yes, the Patriots were _wildly_ innacurate (having an official hit
percentage of 20%, but in reality closer to 10%).  But, you\'re partially
right.  It was never a single patriot that got sent up to hit the SCUDS, they
were sent up in pairs.

As far as physical impact, you\'re right.

The damn things are equipped with. . . .proximity fuzes.

But the SCUD\'s only effectiveness was as a psychological weapon.  The 
Patriot was 100% effective in countering the psychological threat.

   Not quite true - the Mig-29 and the Su-27 (the Mig-31 doesn\'t even
qualify) are _almost_ as good as the F-15. 

   The analog FBW systems aren\'t as clean, and they still use primitive
analog instrumentation (no MFDs); so they don\'t compete with more modern
fighters like the F-16 and the F-18.

   In fact, we\'ve been discussing this on the air.power list; their have
been recent unclass accounts of american F-16s meeting up with east german
Mig-29s surfacing in various periodicals and "trade" journals. The
consensus is the F-16 can easily outperform and outfight the Mig-29 (at
least as american vs. east german pilots are concerned, anyways) _despite_
a theoretical performance advantage on the part of the Mig-29. (I\'ll give
you a clue why this is so; which fighter do you think should win? The
unstable FBW design, or the "conventional" design?)

OK, so perhaps we don\'t agree 100%. But the strange thing is that you don\'t
agree with yourself here. Just below you explain why a 10-30% death rate
dosen\'t have to mean that 10-30% dies. But in that case the canonical 1.5%
death rate is _not_ inherently contradictory.

Precisely. In addition, not all those who get ill and would have died without
help would not get help (I hope that sentense makes sense ;-).

Not even that. I don\'t believe that the Terran doctors could save all who
got infected, but surely they would be able to save some. In fact, that
too is mentioned in the TD#20 article.

7000 years or so. The Vilani invented jump drive in -9235.

Agreed. IMO it seems reasonable to assume that the Vilani would have an
immune system about as strong as any of their minor human subjects.

This dosen\'t prove that they had found out how to make anti-viral vaccines
at the time, merely that IF they had the knowledge then they had the
technology to implement it (Think about it: It is quite possible to 
concieve of a society where lenses are known, but telescopes have not
been invented (The Earth was one such for several centuries). Such a 
society would have the TL to manufacture telescopes, but they would not
have telescopes.)

And that is the one point where I still disagree violently with you. I can
find no canonical evidence that the PoD was hyped in any way. On the
contrary, the sources we have treat the plague quite low-key. THey don\'t
suggest that half the population of the Ziru Sirka perished or anything
else like that. The most extravagant claim it makes (in the S&A article)
is that on several planets the deaths led to the Terran immigrants 
becoming the majority. Since we don\'t know what planets and how many
Vilani there were on them beforehand, nor how many Terran immigrants
moved to those planets, nor just when those planets were infected (it
could have been early on, before anyone had realized the seriousness of
the problem) that dosen\'t really seem so unlikely.

What I think is that some of your opponents in previous discussions have
misunderstood the canonical sources and hyped it out of all proportion,
and you\'ve been fighting that ghost ever since.

Sigh! Well, I guess it is just a matter of time then. Drop tanks are just
too useful. All it takes is one game author who dosen\'t know about them
and another good way to make Milieu 0 different from Milieu 1100 goes out
the window...

Right. I had forgotten that. But you can\'t stop launches from outside the
jump limit. That order might stop standby couriers and prevent the small 
(small on this scale, that is) players like Duchess Delphine and Duke 
Leonard and the sector-wide companies from getting the news right away, 
but it wouldn\'t stop those with courier networks (ie. those organisations
with so many resources that they can afford regular courier runs).

I\'ll conceede that, but they would still get the news far quicker than
through the X-boat network (And they\'d be able to count and work out
that Norris got his patent of elevation _after_ he got the news of
Strephon\'s death (Incidentally, wouldn\'t official Imperial business go
by courier instead of by X-boat?)

Too bad really. Norris\' self-elevation is a wonderful idea, but it dosen\'t
quite hold water (Or rather, the trick it is based on dosen\'t hold water.
I suppose there\'s no reason why Norris can\'t do it anyway. He just has to
realize that a lot of people will have their own thought about the matter. 
Ah well, in my Traveller universe Strephon dosen\'t get killed, so I couldn\'t 
use it anyway...

You\'ll have to try to explain that again, because I totally fail to
understand how this can be true. The bank invests a sum of money and 
gets 6.25% per year for 40 years, at the end of which they own nothing
more than the money they have gotten back. In short, after 40 years they 
have recieved 2.5 times their original investment.

The owner, OTOH, invests a sum of money and gets, according to you,
6.25% per year for 40 years, at the end of which he is the sole owner
of something that is worth about 100-125% of his original investment.
In short, after 40 years he has recieved about 3.5-3.75 times his original
investment. How can the two rates of return possibly be equivalent?

Not only that, but we could put a diamond coating on it as well, and at

way with no increase in cost :-/

Oh, hell, not to interrupt the Jerry Pournelle love-fest, but a) he is
smart, and learned long ago that the best way to look _really_ smart is to
find people who know more about a subject than you and ask them ;-) and b)
I believe he has _one_ PhD, but a polymath temperament, who long ago also
discovered the secret to a fun life...become a successful author. That way
_ANYTHING_ you do can be classified as "research". (Including those 15
hour marathons of Wing Commander and the like ;-)

He didn\'t come up with the WORM drive concept, merely adapted it from his
RL experience. IIRC, the Falkenberg Legion books where he explained the
software was about the time he got one of the first generation WORM drives
himself, and proceeded to rave about them for years in his Byte column.

This is exactly my vision for the Army.  Since each subsector faces a
different defense situation, the Imperium provides funding to equip local
units to Imperial standards, and those units are subject to off-world duty.

This works pretty well, IMHO, since the local world gets improved defenses
at a discount, the locals get some good hi-tech experience, and the
Imperium has good units stashed on almost every planet.

Well, now we know what all those High and Mid passages were for...  I
wasn\'t thunk so much about the scale of entire battleships suffering
mutinies, but the more basic level.. Back when I was in, the had to
seperate me and a soldier form Dallas when we were roomates.  Seems putting
a Cowboys fan and a 493r Faithful in the same room was a mistake during
football season...

I wrote up a description of how the Army is staffed, funded, and organized
a while ago.. if anyone is interested, I could repost it.

That\'s not being pursued actively at the same level of interest as the SSTO/
TSTO designs...Plausible laser launch systems tend to be capable of 
getting about 50 kg payloads into LEO; gun-type launch systems (bigger 
versions of livermore\'s SHARP gun) have similar capabilities. There\'s no
demonstrated market for 50kg satellites sufficiently large to pay off the
big capital costs of setting up such a system. 

Personally, I find the guns more plausible than the lasers - but maybe that\'s
because I spend much time working with people here at LLNL who do big laser
stuff, so I have some idea of the difficulties involved. 

In traveller terms, gas guns, laser launch systems (and more exotic things
like big mass drivers and beanstalks) are all the sort of thing you develop
on an early TL-9 world before you have gravitics - there\'s a very narrow
technological window before they\'re all obsolete (probably too narrow for
any world to ever build a beanstalk.) Still, a TL-9- world might have a 
substantial laser launch system in place...maybe good enough to put several
hundred kg payloads into orbit, or even small ships (Traveller lasers are
better than real-world lasers.)

General note: just using information from a domain expert does not prevent
the ref from being wrong, unfortunately.  There is usually a second step
that players may take, but that the ref will not be able to handle because
of a lack of experience.  For a dramatic example of that, watch a group of
grunts playing with a REMF ref some time.  Or worse, a non military ref.
As soon as combat comes up, they know a lot more about it than the ref, and
argue from experience.  The best combat system in the world will not help
then.

I and my players are all computer adept, and so tend to treat them as
analog computers.  Hard to program, hard to adapt, but very, very fast for
certain tasks.

Your experience with current Unix systems notwithstanding, security is not
a fundamentally tough problem, if the system is stable.  Today, though, it
_is_  tough.  When the systems become stable, such that they do not change
in fundamental architecture or software for several hundred years, then the
security holes you were exploiting are far more likely to be closed.

Consider that your experience is based on a time when the machines are
changing at a fantastic rate - a doubling in speed every 2 years or less,
and thus a corresponding expansion in the capabilities people want out of
their systems.  As a result, it is very unlikely that there has been time
to figure out the impact of even adding a new server to a system.

It would not be too hard to come up with a physical key which could prevent

Not at all, not at all.

I find copy protection loathsome, and wish it would die, but I am forced to
feel that it is going to be with us whenever the systems change slowly.
Consider - recent Vaxen distribute all of the DEC software on the CD ROM,
encrypted with a key that includes the physical serial number of the
machine, which is very hard to change.  Installing that software without
the right key is very difficult, and copying it is not terribly easy.  It
can be done, but DEC figured that was easy enough to just sue the hell out
of someone with.

Once the rate of change slows, we are going to see CP come back.  It is
unpopular now because the machines change fast enough that software broke
regularly.

Note: as with all things, it is never possible to make unbreakable
security, just security which would take more time or expertise to break
than the person with she skills to do so wants to spend.  If there is
substantial legal cost as well, the market gets a bit dicey.

As a result of your post, and my resultant thought about it, I have made a
rules change.  In my universe, the versions, vendors, and keys of the
software on a ship is stored when you hit port.  If the vendor has asked
and paid for the service, those numbers are sent back to them, all without
the knowledge of the players.  This works in the early 3I, because there
are not that many high tech ports.  By the end of the 3I, I suspect the
burden would get unreasonable, and so the practice stopped.

I would tend to disagree with this.  How many decisions a year will the
Emperor make that will effect a Megacorporation a Sector or more away?
Are you going to keep a staff pilot and ship standing by year round on the
off chance something may happen?  And don\'t forget, the pilot will have to
have the liquid assets to pay for fuel for any such trip (incidental, but
it adds up).  Also, what happens if *another* decision is made while the
first pilot is making the round trip to MC HQ?  Or while the ship is going
through maintenance?  How many couriers do you keep in orbit?  Then, of
course, there is orbital/field fees...  And, of course, the Emperor may
just get annoyed at all the ships cluttering his view of his Empire...

Then, of course, there are the ships themselves.  J6 ships (TL 15 by
definition) can only be produced at a relatively few shipyards.  They are
expensive, and haven\'t a shot in hell of recouping the cost.  While it
makes sense that a major corporation would have a presence on Sylea to
promote it\'s interests, and assuming one or more ships were available, how
could they be best put to use?  

For example, there is a regulation that stifles a minor part of your trade
coming up for review, and by the way, Trade Minister Vlea\'s wife has
always wanted to visit the third moon of...  Now, there is that lovely,
hi-tech ship just sitting out there, and that lazy pilot earning his
CrImp 6,000/month sitting in the lounge and this regulation will cost the
Corp MC1 or more per year - what do you do?  

For example, you are the vice president in charge of the Core Sector and,
in addition to all your other duties, you need to meet with some
government officials on some backwater world 12 parsecs away.  Well, with
the courier, that\'s only 2 weeks of travel time...

Finally, there is the matter of actually basing them at Sylea.  You can
only stick so many ships in orbit before things start to happen, and Sylea
will have a lot of traffic to begin with.  And I wasn\'t kidding about the
Emperor getting annoyed, that will cost CREDIT!  For the local
Corporations, there will be bases around Capital, and for Corporations
outside the sector...well, that\'s one way for a local corp to make some
extra credit!   Why station an expensive J6 courier at what has to be the
most expensive orbit in the Empire, when just J4 away you have reciprical
basing rights with Brand-X Corp?  

IMHO, only the Domains will have high jump ships based at Sylea (the
closer to Capital, the less need for a J6 ship, tho).  Perhaps a *few* of
the MegaCorps that have strong ties to capital may have them based around
Sylea, but again - if you are paying for these ships, you are going to
want to get whatever value you can from them. Cost would be the driving
factor.  The only real reason to have a truely independant courier system
from the Empire is if you expect not to be able to use the system that has
been in place and reliable for 1000 years...

	Right.  I\'m familiar with the argument.  My problem with it is 
that it is too stylized. Businesses intend to maximize profits, but they 
don\'t have the perfect information that economic models of firms assume.  
Businesses work much closer to a "stimulus-response" kind of mode where 
if certain strategies or behaviors are rewarded by the marketplace they 
expand them.  All that is to say that I think there is plenty of 
uncertainty and potential for non-optimal behavior in the system.
	As far as the argument you outlined above, if the firm is in a 
perfectly competitive market for inputs and outputs, and the demand for 
labor inputs rise, driving the price up, the firm has no choice but to 
pass this cost on to its customers since it must price at MC=Price.  
Since all firms in this output market face the same input market, they 
all raise prices symmetrically.

	Break out your paddle because, IMHO, we\'re in the swamp.  
Corporate America has become very good at using incentive schemes to come 
closer to profit maximization (at least in the short-run) but most people 
are employed by small businesses which probably still fall far short on 
this mark.

	The real productivity gains can\'t be over-looked.  As far as 
anyone can tell they are legitimate.  And really, it\'s about time.  Labor 
productivity growth was stagnate for almost the last 20 years in the 
U.S.  
	I don\'t know how much of the profits from stock speculation have
recycled back into the economy to fuel the boom.  I haven\'t looked at the
numbers in any detail, but I understand that far more money is flowing
into the market than flowing out.  That\'s not to say that the market
itself hasn\'t been floating on a speculative bubble, but it\'s not clear 
that it has spread to the rest of the economy.

	Historically, yeah free traders mattered a lot, but that\'s because
there was no other way for the people on either end to trade with each
other.  Once you have regular freight service and communications (which I
assume exists in the Imperium) then there\'s far less need to do business
this way.  When new areas of trade are opened (like the Dutch East Indies
or a similarly rich new region in M0) then there will be a shortage of
shipping that serves this region and ships captains will be able to
operate like free traders until freight service and more normal commercial
relations are established between buyers and sellers on either end that
allow them to eliminate the free trader middle-man.

	Okay, but what\'s the _supply_ of skilled gunners?  If it is 
small, then you\'re right, they probably could demand better pay.  On the 
other hand, their value depends on the probability of violent encounters 
in space.  If the IN is worth a damn, these should be few.  Heck, even a 
half-dozen SDBs can effectively control the 100-d limit of most planets.

	I agree that Megacorps are much more efficient about managing 
ships in port and getting them back in j-space where they belong.  As for 
FTs making long-haul runs, I still have to wonder why you can\'t stick it 
on the freighters.  Even if they don\'t make those runs, you could still 
"check through" (like baggage) your freight all they way to its 
destination.
 
> Anyway, taking cargo across a sector seems more heroic and adventurous than
> doing short-haul runs along a main, and thus should be encouraged.

	An excellent reason!  Actually, it even makes sense for time 
sensitive goods.  FTs could serve a niche for goods, passengers, and info 
that want the additional speed of a direct trip.  Particularly for 
destinations not on the freight "hubs" FTs could make good long-haul 
direct runs.  
	I could even see a group of Free Traders learning that a company on the
world they\'re on is making a big shipment to a world on the other side of
the subsector because of a shortage there.  The Free Traders could then 
try to get a hold of some of the goods themselves and beat the big 
shipment to market.  They\'d never be able to haul enough to slake demand, 
but that just means they can charge more for what they _do_ bring!
	This idea is beginning to make more sense to me.  When I get some
time, I\'ll sit down with a sub-sector and try to think about this more
concretely. For sure though, the J-1 Free Trader would be inferior to the 
J-2 Far Trader for this sort of work.

	You\'re right that it doesn\'t feel much like Trav.  But then, who 
ever adventured in the "staid, settled areas of the Imperium" anyway?  
The Marches were always supposed to be a frontier.

> Oh, and I dont believe in Subsidized Merchants per se (although, given

	I think the deal with SMs is not encouraging shipping per se, but 
encouraging frequent, but uneconomic, contact between backwater worlds 
and the rest of the Imperium.  The economic logic might dictate that a 
big freighter call on a small world every few weeks, while the needs of 
steady commercial and political ties requires contact every few days.

In the course of cooking up more about the Sayat, I realized that their

uncordial... the Zhos being, of course, the willing puppet-creatures of the
demons of the Outer Void, a.k.a. "Droyne"...  besides being bellowing

Fair point - I am well aware of the UK efforts in this field - warhead
design and technology has been in ongoing development in the country since
the 40\'s. HOWEVER we bought both the SS(B)N power plant and launcher
(Polaris/Trident) off the USA following the cancellation of our own missile
projects. Oh, for the TSR2 to have been deployed! ;-)

IIRC it is an Ancients Artifact, somewhere between Pocket Universes and
J-Drive. It may put a twist in canon, but that could just be a better
understanding of Jump theory and an earlier reaching of J4 technology...


Or it is an artifact *beyond* the comprehension of the Imperials
investigating it (see Iain Banks\' Excession for more ideas on this)? It
doesn\'t have to have a major impact....

I think that all we know from canon sources is that "high-capacity"
passenger service was instituted at Regina in the 1100s, and was considered
nifty at the time.  We know that this high-capacity service used drop tanks,
because a drop-tank failure caused the loss of a passenger ship.

What we _don\'t_ know from canon material is whether or not drop tanks were:
1) A new innovation at that time, or
2) A new innovation in passenger service, or
3) Long-established in passenger service elsewhere, but used in the Marches
   for the first time, or
4) Long-established for special (military) purposes, but being used in
   passenger service in the Marches for the first time, or
5) A well-established practice that normally wasn\'t considered newsworthy,

   of the ship.

As far as I\'m aware, there are no canon sources that conclusively establish
that drop tanks were NOT in use prior to the early 1100s.  There is some
small evidence to suggest that drop tanks WERE used (at least by the
Imperial military) earlier than the 1100s: I believe that it\'s mentioned in
_Trillion Credit Squadron_ that the Imperial strike cruiser that misjumped
into the Islands Cluster eventually repaired it\'s drive and jumped accross
the rift to Imperial space using drop tanks.  This would have happened
before the early 1100s, but I don\'t remember when (3rd Frontier War? 4th?).

The drop tanks are included, with no TL or Milieu restrictions.  This is
only a "canon breaker" if you subscribe to interpretation #1 above as Hans
does.  I don\'t (my position is somewhere between #4 and #5)*.  FF&S2 also
does not provide for Hans\' improvement in Jump Drive capacitor technology
that enables the use of drop tanks in his interpretation.


* If you\'re curious, my position is that drop tanks have some degree of
  inherent risk - if you use them regularly, there\'s a small but non-zero
  chance of having your own Trimhanka-Brilliance disaster (note that this
  level of risk is NOT described in FF&S2).

  For military operations during a war, this is usually an acceptable risk,
  and Imperial warships are prepared to use drop tanks when a mission
  profile calls for it.

  Drop tanks aren\'t used for merchant operations because of the risk.  The
  insurance underwriters don\'t want to carry the risk (even though it\'s
  relatively small)+, so the policies on your ship either become void or
  MUCH more expensive if you use drop tanks.  This means that the small
  shippers (who invariably purchase ships with standard bank loans, and
  must carry insurance for the bank) can\'t use drop tanks.

  Tukera is large enough that it can "self-insure" (that is, they have a big
  enough bank account to pay any claims, no insurance needed).  Because of
  this, Tukera could experiment with technology that was unavailable to
  their smaller competition. 

  Tukera is used to holding a monopoly on the major passenger and trade
  routes; normally this leads to a very conservative approach.  But in
  the Marches they had effective competition, particularly from Oberlindes
  operating from Regina.  Thus, Oberlindes tried using drop tanks, knowing
  that Oberlindes wouldn\'t be able to effectively compete against it. 
  UNfortunately for Tukera, a drop-tank accident destroyed a ship and
  nearly everyone on it relatively shortly after inagurating the service.


+ Insurance underwriters - particularly for large, expensive items like
  ships and their cargoes, tend to be conservative, and react VERY badly to
  elements of risk.  In the War of 1812, US privateers (like John Paul
  Jones) operating near England managed to severaly hurt British trade.
  But not because of the shipping destroyed or captured (which was a
  relatively small fraction).

  The US privateers caused enough havoc, and the Royal Navy seemed unwilling
  or unable to stop them, that insurance rates doubled or tripled.  This
  caused the shippers considerable financial pain, since that money came
  out of the shipper\'s profit margins, at least in the short term.

The Su-27 and the F-15 are quite close, however, in performance
characteristics.  In particular, thrust-to-weight ratio actually favors the
Su-27 Flanker.

The Su-35, the new and improved digital FBW Flanker, also has additional
canards mounted below the canopy which give unparalleled manuverability.  So,
in summation, we have a fighter with a smaller radar cross section, more
power and manuverability and a modern FBW system.

The only reason the new Flanker-B/D(?) can\'t compare in a one on one battle
is due to the vastly superior training of the average Western fighter jock.
 For crying out loud, the Russian government can\'t even pay their troops, but
once or twice a year.  By the way, what happened to our good friend, Gen.
Alexandr Lebed?

convert FFS2 to CSC values also.

To make this table I used the *hard steel* standard, ie converted using the
value for hard steel in each system.

I can send a HTML version for those that might want to post it on a webpage.

Usage:
CM=centimeters of hard steel
CSC=CSC armor value
FFS2-FFS2 armor value
All values rounded to the nearest .5

Look up a armor value of 20 in FFS2, well that comes out to seven
centimeters of hard steel and a CSC armor value of 11. A CSC armor value of
20 comes to value of 103 in  FFS2 or 36 cm of hard steel.

Unlikely. Assuming you can generate a big enough gravity well, you
still have to get it in the path of the ship. And that path could pass
thru quite a wide area. Several AU across.

It\'s been discussed. But you need a gigawatt beam for about 5 tons of ship.

to anybody attacking the port (a gigawatt laser with a ROF of 60 to 100
times *per second* is gonna ruin your day :-)

No, not at all.  *Genetically*, they\'d be indistinguishable from other 1-g
humaniti (assuming that\'s what grav the first Zilan settlers came from, of
course).  Let two Zilan parents conceive a child on a 1-g world (probably
by artificial insemination...), let her carry it to term there (with
constant medical attention, and at some risk to her life), and raise the
resulting child there, and you\'ll see a normal 1-g human as a result.

However, nature is only half of the nature+nurture equation.  Human bones
and muscles develop in the ways we\'re all familiar with partly *because*
we spend our entire lives in a 1-g field.  As Russian medical experiments
have shown, bone mass, calcium levels, and muscle tone all drop
precipitously in 0-g; presumably similar though less severe effects would
occur in 1/5 gee as on Zila.  Zilans living on Zila would tend to have
thin, brittle bones, and perhaps carry too much mass for their frames
(relative to the 1-g \'norm\').  They *might* tend to be a few inches
taller, simply because the skeleton would be compressed less.

Put one of these people into a 1-g field, though, and you\'d have a very
unhappy invalid.  Have you ever been off your feet for any significant
length of time (say, due to illness or injury)?  Remember that horrible
wobbly, weak feeling you had trying to walk after not using your legs for
a few weeks?  That might approximate how a Zilan would feel in 1-g -- *at
first*, perhaps for as much as a year or two.  Following that, they\'d
probably be more or less acclimated, though the bones might remain a bit
weaker than average permanently.

I certainly share your concern about this...my \'pet\' world, Quopist in the
Marches, is a size *1* world with a thin atmosphere.  Just explaining how
that can be is hard; answering your questions is still harder.

This gets into the broader issue that Trav worlds are all too often
described by refs or adventures without really taking into account their
UPPs.  A dense, tainted atmosphere (for example) would be the first thing
you\'d notice about a new planet on arrival, and would affect *everything*
about daily life, city design, settlement patterns, transport, and so
forth on that planet.  But one frequently sees world write-ups that just
ignore this.

Anyway, here are some handwaves you might try out for the low-gee-natives
problem:

* A miracle drug becomes available at highish TLs which helps the
  body acclimate far more quickly and easily.  A nanotech or viral
  agent would work best here.  A likely side effect would be voracious
  hunger for high calcium and protein foods, as all the added bone and
  muscle mass has to come from somewhere.  The Imperium subsidizes
  production and distribution of this drug as part of its trade
  enhancement program, and it\'s automatically included (if needed) in
  the standard costs of starship travel, and in the cost of ship\'s
  provisions per FF&S.

* Natives wishing to travel off-planet eventually spend 1-3 hours per
  day working out in 1-g gyms.  Additionally, some children (rich ones,
  or all on wealthy worlds with subsidies) spend still more of their time
  in 1-g settings in order to foster their proper bone and muscle
  development.  Pregnant women might do the same to provide for proper
  fetal development.

* We really don\'t have any data on the effects of low gravity on humans --
  just 1 and 0.  Perhaps even as little as a tenth of a g is much less
  harmful than our current models indicate.  This would translate into
  faster and easier acclimation.

Hope this helps!

  True. But they are therefore correct in designing hardware for that
purpose. Mind you, I do a bunch of the work for our microarmour groups

the stuff.

  Their best troops use equipment appropriate to their mission. I agree
that the M-1 series are awesome vehicles - but they are MBT\'s, and thus
not appropriate for all missions.

  Part of the problem with the French hardware is the procurement process
(hmm, that sounds familiar). Orders are spread out amongst various of the
nationalised arms firms to keep them all in business and employing their
contingents of voters. Economies of scale are poor, and are tweaked by
pushing foreign sales, often with "foreign aid" credits from other arms of
the French gov\'t - France is a major offender with that tendency. The fact
seems to be that the French were morally certain that a Soviet conventional
attack on Europe was not going to happen. In retrospect, they may simply
have known things that the public in the West didn\'t.

  OC, they may have been re-equipping to fight their most recent (colonial)
war again - a bad habit world-wide, and one which I think the U.S. has done
very well in avoiding the last decade or so.

  In T*, the issue can be viewed several ways - what fun or money can be
had with arms procurement or transport, or with silly deployments. IIRC,
one of Daley\'s "Han Solo" novels (rather good, actually) has a backwater
dictatorship equipped with imported APC\'s; specifically, run-down garbage
trucks...

  Also, one Challenge mag had a 1200 mt assault tank. Imagine the players
trying to figure out how to drive it on to their freighter without it simply
dropping through the cargo bays decking :)

I don\'t recall making any suggestion remotely like "make them just another
race ... in which women are trying for equal rights". My suggestion was for
female-dominated clans to *differ* from the steriotypical male clan, not
that the females are going to be running around with razor dewclaws or
something. In fact, that is exactly what I DIDN\'T want. If the existence of
one female-dominated clan out of the billions of Aslan is unacceptable,
then make it a male-dominated clan that is interested in economic conquest
and not military. I just was tired of every Aslan having the same
personality.

IIRC there have been huge controversies in the American and Israeli
militaries about the role of women in combat, but that has nothing to do
with the issue.

My "Klingons in fur" remark was about all Aslan clans being portrayed
exclusively as warriors. I wanted there to be some variety in Aslan
society. Female Aslan are supposed to be more interested in trade and
technology, so I thought a female-dominated clan would be a good fit for a
clan that emphasizes them. The males would be less interested in this, so
why would there be a "gender struggle"? I\'m not saying there couldn\'t be,
it just doesn\'t follow that there would have to be.

   Even in the T:2000 scenario, the US could draw on a large number of
irregular forces, equipped with semi-auto rifles and pistols and a
variety of regular military surplus items for home defense.  Training
could be provided by the thousands of veterans nationwide, many with
prior combat experience.

   Invading Mexican forces could expect a tactical nuclear device to
explode over their heads as they cross the border (failing that nerve
gas--if we are talking about national survival, gassing Mexican troops
who a) don\'t carry NBC gear and b) can\'t retaliate is a viable option). 
Surviving units would find that not only would they be facing fanatical
resistence from well armed paramilitary "gringos", but Latinos born in
this country as well.  

   While I would buy without any problem large-scale "bandito" raids
into the US from Mexico (Ponco Villa gained his fame conducting raids
along the Mexico-US border earlier this century), a full scale invasion
is not plausible.  Raids by Mexican forces (unauthorized military,
paramilitary, etc.) would cause even further damage to the US (as if the
limited nuke war wasn\'t enough)--imagine if you will the infamous "Sack
of Las Cruces" (anyone see a Traveller parallel here), which was looted
and burned to the ground before the American military could do anything
about it.  Hard to justify popping nerve gas in a scenario like this
one, yet it opens up similar adventures to those that involve involving
supposed Soviet troops in San Antonio.

>What, so Hispanics wouldn\'t fight for the US?  My (Hispanic from Los

   Lost in all the BS of this discussion is the fact that the some of
the people in California who are most against illegal immigration are
Latinos.  They would no more be Mexican sympathizers than
Japanese-Americans were followers of Tojo during WW II.

Ad nauseam! ;->

Yeah, you can go buy a WORM for under a thousand bucks..probably a *lot*
less than a thousand now.  They are favored by authors, accountants, and
auditors.  The idea is that you can write on the disk, but you can\'t erase
anything your write.  For an author each version saved is added to the disk
so she can always step back to *any* previously saved version. For
accountants and auditors, the advantage is similar..plus it gets very hard
to "cook the books" when every entry is permanently encoded on the disk.

For the rest of us, it\'s cheaper and better to get true R/W optical disks. 
So when is R/W-DVD going to hit the market...at under $500?  ;->

As for as the "Stemple" stuff that Leroy was kicking around...why not just
say the architecture is built around specialized neural net hardware? 
Neural nets are exotic enough to ignore details in a game and by their
nature are "learning" machines on the road toward AI or even AE.

Ah, memories.  I remember reading an article in HotRod pitting Big
Daddy Garnett against an F-16 taking off from a carrier using a steam
catapult.  Big Daddy\'s dragster ran a "land" course of approximately
the same distance-- and won.

Out of curiosity, just what is wrong with GURPS mechanics (besides

They don\'t want to simply make a GURPS Traveller to set the jumble of
combat systems/char gen/design systems etc in place. They want to create
something NEW so that those of us that have everything Traveller related
will still buy it. Either fast forward to after the TNE era but then hey\'d
have to live with all the stupid things done to Traveller by TNE and
alienate lots of potential customers. They could branch off at the
rebellion but maybe they think that a large Imperium more or less stable is
a good idea as it allows the ref to be creative and not having to worry
about this or that planet being nuked.

Personally I think GURPS Traveller is the best thing that has happened
since Striker I. Finally a combat system that is detailed and somewhat
consistent with other rules. Most people seem to dislike GURPS for its char
gen system but how that is handled is up to the ref. I like the combat
system and the vehicle systems a lot.

	Well I must speak out against the noble aslan being compared to
star dreks crummiest alien , please now . Alsan have always seemed about
right with there warrior code and male dominated culture . I compared
them to fuedal samurai in there general culture and outlook magnified
some what . in my campaign aslan encountered refer to each othe by clan
name personal name and sex suffix ,in that order . this is important
because in my view of aslan job title does much to denote sex suffix so a
male human merchant would be addressed with the female suffix while a
female merc captain would be addressed with the male suffix . this is not
because the aslan can\'t tell the difference betwenn a human male or
female but more because it is cultural and IMO some what psychologically
ingrained .
	on this same note a female aslan who wanted to be a warrior would
be viewed as a abomination and would bring great shame and dishonor upon
her family 
( possibly leading to ritual suicide ) as would a male who wanted to be a
computer tech. I think the aslan culture is genitically ingrained so I
don\'t think the above would happen . of course this is all my oppinion
and how I do it in my campaign .

I do not like klingons .. but I love the aslan . lets not compare glass
and diamonds

Well, this is a complicated one.  When I started the campaign almost two
years ago, I hadn\'t yet heard that T4 was coming out.

I liked the detail in TNE, but I hated the rules implementation.  I
spent three years, working on and off, converting the whole TNE rules
system to the MT task system.

Boy, I\'ll never do that again.

So, we started the campaign with this TNE rules set--using the MT task
system and only D6\'s.

Then, T4 came out,and it through a wrench in the plan.  We switced to
the TNE rules system, but we used the T4 task system. Having played with
all of that detail, we were reluctant to move to T4 basic way of doing
things.

But, I got tired of having, every time we played, to tweak something.
Conversion was a bitch.  So, I switced the group over to the published
T4 rules.

It was a lot less detail, but it was a lot less complicated too. 
Everyone bitched at first, but then we started noticing something.  We
were picking up on the T4 rules much faster than we had the TNE rules,
and we were having less in-game discussions about why a rule was a
particular way.  I actually started having game sessions where I didn\'t
have to tweak a T4-TNE conversion.

So, I was sold on T4.

Then we had another problem--which became a problem for the whole list. 
I figured out how blown out of proportion the T4 task system was--things
like 40% chances for Impossible rolls for characters with level 3
skills.

This led to the KBv1.1 task system.  And, we were happy in our game for
a while.

Then, Marc announced that he would be tweaking the T4 task system for
T4.1.  I went to work to fix some of the things that I didn\'t like about
KBv1.1.

And, the brainchild of that endeavor was KBv2.0.

Today, my group is going along strong.  We use T4 rules modified by the
KBv2.0 task system.  

I keep experimenting with new ways to do things.  The Traveller universe
is so big, and there are several supplements out there from four game
editions.

The last three games, I added CT\'s tactical combat system, Snapshot, to
the mix.  Everybody seems to like it, so I think it will be a keeper.

I experiement with other things too.  When I get something the way I
like it, I leave it, and that\'s the way we do it from then on out.

Right now, I am experimenting with hit location charts.  I\'ve been using
Glenn Grant\'s chart, but I found one designed by DGP that I tried out
last Sunday.  The verdict is still out on that one.

I wrote a short story about one of the                      events that happened in the game.

                     I\'d say we are all very much into it.

> P.S. At what point could a group split into two adventures?

Hmm.  I don\'t know about that one.

> What\'s an ideal critical mass?

We started our game with 6 players and me GMing.  In starting a new game
that only one player had played before and only one other player even
hearing of it before, it was hectic.

Everybody had only one character, and this meant if we spent the whole
night (ie somebody stayed back with the ship) with only a couple of
characters, some players didn\'t do anything all night.  They got bored.

Well, two players did get bored in my game.  But, the rest of us were
happy that happened, because shedding that dead weight really allowed us
to pick up the pace and ensure that everybody was included.

We\'ve been having a blast since then.

I\'d say 5 players is about has high as I want to go.  I\'d say 3-5
players is optimal.

Another consideration is juggling everybody\'s schedule.  The more
players you have, the harder it is to get everybody together, the less
you play.

We\'ve got a rule that, if everybody doesn\'t show up, then we don\'t
play.  We don\'t do this, "You run my character next game session for me"
stuff.  Every character has a unique personality and only one player,
the player who created him, can play him correctly.

There\'s a lot of pressure to show up to my game--but it is not negative
pressure.  We are all dedicated, and we enjoy the hell out of role
playing.  We don\'t want somebody playing with us who is not going to be
dependable.

We set up the game about a month in advance, so the game doesn\'t get put
off because so and so\'s wife has to go visit her grandmother and so and
so can\'t make it.

Also, we have a rule, if we don\'t play at least twice in a month, we
make up the game date.  If we only get one game in, say, September, we
will play three games in October.

Given this--juggling jobs, wives, and lives--nobody wants to miss
anyway.

Besides, we all love it.

Dennis,

Have you got the EA?  There is a section in the front that talks about
weapons and how they work in different environments.  Vacuum is
included.  With special modifications, most weapons do work in vacuum,
and there are game rules for this in that section of the EA.

Regina/Regina (0310-A788899-A) Date: 097-1105
Officials of the General Shipyards on Regina announced that it has 
completed negotiations with Tukera Lines to locally manufacture L-Hyd drop 
tanks for use on high-capacity commercial vessels. General will assemble 
components at its more modern facilities on Pixie (0303-A1001030-D). The 
first production examples are expected to be available within six months, 
at which time Tukera Lines will begin high capacity service from the 
interior. Component assembly will be carried out at General\'s more modern 
facilities on Pixie (0303-A100103-D).

L-Hyd drop ships have only been in service for the last dozen years in the 
interior, being made possible by recent advances in the field of capacitor 
engineering, a joint press release explained. Commercial vessels equipped 
with the new generation of long-storage jump capacitors carry jump fuel in 
specially designed L-Hyd drop tanks in excess of their rated tonnage. Upon 
conversion of the fuel to the massive energy required for jump, the drop 
tanks are explosively jettisoned through the use of break-away connections 
and explosive bolts. Jump is executed when the remains of the tanks are a 
safe distance from the vessel.

A spokesman for General Shipyards explained that local yards are not yet 
capable of manufacturing the long-storage capacitors required for the 
process, but that production of the drop tanks is possible, thus allowing 
the high capacity starships of the Tukera Lines to begin service to the 
Regina subsector.

L-Hyd tanks are not reusable, and thus increase the absolute cost per jump. 
However, experience has shown that the increase in cargo tonnage resulting 
from the elimination of internal J-fuel storage more than makes up for 
this, the press release explained.

The joint press release concluded by stating that local manufacture of 
L-Hyd drop tanks marks the dawn of a new era of commerce and prosperity in 
the Regina subsector. Following the announcement, common stock in 
Oberlindes Lines plummeted 27 points on the Regina exchange before trading 
was suspended. Officials of Oberlindes Lines were not available for 
comment.

This is exactly true!  I\'m glad I asked this question, because it has
sure got me thinking more about the whole issue.  I\'m going to put more
effort into this in my campaign.  I want to make my worlds more alien. 
I want my players to think about the problems associated with life on
another planet.

This is a sci-fi game after all.  The different places they go is not
just Earth dressed up like another planet.  When they land on differnt
planets, my job as a GM is to describe it in such a way so that they
"get into" this new planet.  I want to make them wonder.

Otherwise, we\'re just playing Star Trek, where every planet is class M,
breathable,and at 1G.

I am going to endeavor to make my players feel like they are on the far
reaches of the universe--or in the Spinward Marches anyway.

This has been a good exercise for me.  I really appreciate you and your
brother\'s comments.  They have been excellent.

   Nelson would rise up from his grave and sink the HMS Victory

   Mary Rose?  Can\'t be any bigger than a frigate, and the Constitution
will sink any frigate sent up against her.

   Anyone know where the USS Enterprise (WW II carrier) is these days? 
I hope someone had the good sense to preserve her too (had a reputation
nearly as good as Constitution\'s--fought at Midway and many other
battles without being sunk).  She may be needed again.

   I\'m not saying that those responsible would be caught right away, but
these things have a way of being found out later on (particularly when
they are sponsored by another government).  I doubt that the US would
bother with extradiction proceedings and would probably just proceed
with passing sentence...<BOOM>

The disadvantage of female cathing is *finding* the urethral meatus. 
With the vagarities of human anatomy being what they are, there are a
multitude of areas it can be in to begin with, and in addition its location
and appearance can actually change over time with childbirth, aging,
etc. And the appearance itself can and does vary considerably from 
individual to individual, about 50% of the time, a good deal of searching
is required, and I\'ve put in a shitload of caths. While once found, an 
individual female would know the general location of her meatus, it
is also in a rather inconvenient location as regards self-cathing. I can
definitely see it would take a good deal more flexibility and time than
using a condom cath in many cases. Everyone I know much prefers to
cath males, even considering the length of the urethra and the all to 
common problem of enlarged prostates to deal with...

I like groups of three to five people, at this size I can think of
adventures which involve the whole group that have a decent and thoughtful
plot. Above this size I tend to go for more action oriented material, as it
is hard to maintain peoples atttention with complicated plotlines with aa
large group. (that\'s not to say that I haven\'t successfully run a
complicated plotline with a group of 8 people, just that it is physically
tiring.)

As a side note, most of the players in the core group are 27 to 31 years of
age. Most of us hope to teach our kids how to roleplay. Is there anyone who
has done that already???? (can\'t wait... "dad... could you pass the d6" hee

I\'ll have to search diligently for it, I called them in 1990 and scribbled

Hmmm, a combat system in 1 sec rounds just makes my life difficult (and
yes I DO use the TNE combat system).

I would appreciate GURPS design systems a lot more if they did a one book
FF&S style thing for everything... and they could also save on the amount
of space they waste on equipment guides... but GURPS is not the biggest
offender in the RPG field, games like ShadowRun and CyberPunk use a whole
page for 1 item!

The character gen system would be fine if the players didn\'t know anything
about GURPS and were told to describe their character - then fit it to the
rules, rather than \'I want this, this, this and this...\'

The task system is a bit weak from what my friends tell me, but I can\'t be
positive of that myself.

Yes I know art doesn\'t make a game, but GURPS ARTWORK SUCKS! I thought
MT\'s was bad, but GURPS takes the cake... can\'t they hire a few more 
artists with the amount of money they make? 

And in the end, I guess I don\'t like buying 6+ books for a basic SF
setting (That\'s why I avoid T4 too) and then having to error-proof them.
I\'ve already had my share of errors being a veteran of MT.

    'body' => 'There\'s a rather good book by Trevor Dupuy called \'Future Wars\', which
takes history up to 1993 as is, then extrapolates events onwards. Several
conventional conflicts are dealt with, using the simulations system Dupuy
has developed. Events are then related as a historical account. We have
another Arab-Israeli war, a Pakistan-India punchup, etc.

For those of us interested in T2000 type scenarios, it\'s be a most
interesting read (Actually it\'s worth reading for its own sake as
entertainment - it\'s that good. But only if warfare doesn\'t bother you.)

Patriot Vs SCUD: Yeah, the patriot system wasn\'t as good as expected -
indeed there were casualties caused by bits of Patriot falling to earth.
But it did its job, which was as a counter to the \'terror weapon\' effect of
the Scuds. Instead of the Israeli public demanding that \'something be
done\', and possibly forcing Israel into the war (That would have been a
terrible thing. We might have seen an \'Arabs Vs Imperialistic Zionistic
Dogs\' jihad, the activation of alliances... God knows.) the Israeli public
saw \'something\' being done. Morale was bolstered. Thus an ineffective
weapon\'s very real psychological effect countered the real psychological
effect of another ineffective weapon. War is complicated, ain\'t it?

The effects were similar to the WWII bombing campaign over Germany. Other
than causing appalling civilian casualties, there was no great effect on
the German war production. Did the Allied commanders really think that the
German populace couldn\'t stand the bombing when British people managed it?
Perhaps. But all those troops wasted, firing inaccurate shells into the sky
every night were not overrunning Allied states. The AA guns and
searchlights were built instead of tanks and guns, thus  soaking up war
production.

The result? The bombing campaign DID have an effect on the outcome of the
war - but not for the reasons normally quoted (Strategic heavy bombing was
much less effective than the precision strikes made by, for example,
Mosquito aircraft. But the British public demanded big bombers dropping
bucketfulls of ordnance. Another psychological effect?). My point is that
the Patriot and the SCUD both played a role in the Gulf war. A civilian who
sees a defensive missile battery is reassured by it. When (s)he sees
missiles tearing up into the night sky, the thought is \'thank God for
Patriot. Think of how many of these missiles might get through if we DIDN\'T
have it....\' 

Don\'t write off the psych. effect of weapons. After all, unless you kill an
entire population, or break all their weapons and their means of making
more, then only way to end a war is to make the opposition want to stop
fighting. Perhaps in this war of wills, the psychological effect of weapons
is as great as their destructive power. Look at the A-bombs dropped on
Japan. More people died in the firebombing of Tokyo than in the nuclear
blast - but which weapon is hailed as the war-winner?

Well, yes and no. The problem with the TL rating system is that it has always
been used to show what a society (the Imperium) *had* at that TL, *NOT* what it
was capable of. Ergo, if its mentioned in "canon" that TL12 is related to
anti-viral tech, then they had anti-viral tech at TL12. That\'s the way its
always been.

Granted, I will agree that the Traveller TL system is, and always has been,
simplistic in the extreme and completely stuffed in this particular aspect --
and even that the adding of anti-viral tech at TL12 was probably the result of
the designers not making a connection between the possibilities of that and the
effects it would have on the PoD (or vice versa, depending on which was written
first). However, we still have it that anti-viral tech was available.

No it is not in the game (of course ;) but someone (no name on website?)
made a very nice map to use with Marathon. It is at:

It should also be noted that the website in question was built using Frontier.

I was originally talking about improved fission being a viable alternative to 
fusion, as the ability to manipulate the strong (or is it weak?) force would 
assist fission just as much as fusion.

Someone contered that fission was "bad" (I have summarised heavily) due to the 
high availablity of bomb-making material.

To which I countered that would-be bomb makers can just buy the 
fission-powered vehicles on TL 8 worlds.

Sorry Harold, but the USS Enterprise (2WW version) was sold for scrap on
1st July 1958 (Aircraft Carriers of the World, Roger Chesneau). It was
indeed a tragic loss, one going against the USN trend to preserve historic
ships. Reminds me of a shirt produced on HMS Ark Royal on her final cruise.
It proudly bore the message "I shaved in the Ark Royal, not with her"

Man modified; Became a degenerate empire ruled with an iron fist from
it\'s central point, Earth.   (converted to a Ringworld)  The colonies
had revolted, and Imperial Fleets fought a war of anhiliation against
all the colony worlds.  Some few colonists escaped in ships to found the
3rd Imperium in the traveller setting.  This game starts in 1108 of that
Imperium.  The Sword Worlds leader Lucas Trask has fought the Imperial
Navy in Lanth after ceding the Sword Worlds subsector, and has suffered
a small setback as Imperial Forces, well entrenched on Lanth and in that
subsector, defeat his initial force.  Meanwhile Earth has been all but
forgotten.  The old Imperial forces of earth failed to find these
splinter colonies that fled it, for some reason.

    'body' => 'Well my copy finally arrived today. Since I was charged in July, I will say
I\'m not impressed with the delivery time. However that is a relatively
minor quibble. On to the book proper

Physical quality is very good. The binding is robust and should last well.
I would have used a heavier card for the cover, but that is a very minor
point. Someone got a little heavy handed with the glue in my copy and two
of the pages were stuck together, but that can happen in any print run and
was easily fixed with a little gentle pursuassion.

The only new content appears to be the 34 new pages in M:0, but this new
content is all good stuff. A timeline with a paragraph explaining major
events; a detailed coverage of the pacification campaigns (both pro and
anti viewpoints, a definite plus) with special emphasis on the failed
Antarean campaign; a chart detailing the expansion of the Imperium by
sector; coverage of some of the rivals of the 3I (a little brief, but still
good); 7 adventure plots in 76 patrons format; a detailed adventure (good
but with another damn virus; could adventure writers please check their
biology, there are other disease pathogens than viruses; and they actually
can work from alien environments!); and finally rules for expanding the
UWP, including detailed rules for expanding the law level profile.

All of this new material is good, the new background (actually most of
it is simply restatement of stuff from old out of print CT and MT
material, but remember access to that material can prove difficult now)
is well laid out and greatly adds to the feel of the Milleu. The
adventure plots are useful, the full adventure appears to be reasonable
except for the virus (I\'d recommend replacing the virus with a bacteria
or protoza), and the UWP extension rules are useful (even if the do have
"fix" written all over them). I\'m certain there\'s going to be a lot of
complaints about the use of the old data from FS, but this can be worked
round (me, I simply rerolled the LL for each world, not as time consuming
as one might think, just do it when the world comes into play).

The FS section doesn\'t appear to have been altered, even with the new
extended LL profile this is a major gripe. I can sort of except the LL
fix, but there are still just too many high tech worlds lurking out
there. Still with the LL fix the data does become playable (but only
just).

Overall I\'d rate it as 7 out of 10. Only one question though. What the
heck was the "American Division" that Marc did his tour in Vietnam with?
May I hazzard a guess that its a typo for "Americal"?

    'body' => 'Robert Eaglestone asked about gaming groups:

I joined an existing gaming group 2 1/2 years ago - I don\'t know how long
it\'d been running. My previous group wound up after 4 years or so - a
massed emigration/relocation left me all but alone!

The group I joined is a spinoff from a Sunday Evening club (quite large,
with wargamers too, but I don\'t attend.) THe spinoff group meets every
week, with a ref and 5 players. There have been up to 8, but with this vast
number someone is going to get sick and stop coming - thankfully!

The 5 players are really too many - we have a \'misdirected chat\' problem,
which isn\'t so bad since I shot one of the players out of hand last week
(OK - I threw a cushion, but the efect was remarkably similar). Point is:
the best Traveller I\'ve played recently was as one of 2 players. The best
RQ I ran had 2 players, too. I like three or four (hand-picked!) players
for my RQ campaign - it\'s an invitation-only occasional game, unlike the
Traveller campaign.

Until recently we ran a different game each week in rotation. Now we have a
common Traveller (M0) campaign with two referees (soon to be three)
participating. 85% of the rules are straight out of the book, 10% tweaks
and 5% common sense (except when I\'m reffing, in which case it\'s 100%
guess-at-something-which-might-be-in-the-rulebook, since I\'m terrible at
remembering rules and renowned for not opening the books for months on end.
Still, if it\'s realistic, nobody minds.

Five players is a maximum, in my opinion. Any more and the munchies run out
too fast!

It isn\'t as clear-cut as that. There are some inventions that more or less
defines some TLs. You can\'t have a Robotics TL of 12 without being able to
build TL 12 robots. But other TLs clearly defines potential rather than
specific capabilities. Otherwise the RoM would also have had drop tanks
and Fusion+, the inventor of lenses would also have invented telescopes,
and the Scout ship that wound up in the Islands Cluster wouldn\'t have been
able to get their jump drive repaired.

You can argue that if a society isn\'t of a sufficiently high TL then it
can\'t have this and that artifact (and even there you run into the question 
of experimental tech and hand-crafted one-offs (there are examples of 
revolvers built in the mid 18th century, for example)), but you can\'t argue 
the other way about everything. I\'d accept that if you can demonstrate
that the knowledge already exists, then you can assume that the capability
implies the existense of the technology. But AFAIK there is no mention of 
anti-viral remedies during the Interstellar Wars in any of the published 
material (I wonder: could that be what Duskir et alii invented?).

Since gunpowder contains both oxidant and oxidizer, all firearms will work
quite well in a vaccuum, better, in fact, than they will _in_ an
atmosphere. You\'ll get higher muzzle velocities, since the bullet won\'t
have to push the air out of the barrel, a considerable increase in range,
since air resistance is gone.

DS does stand for discarding sabot.

Now, on _long_ exposure to vaccuum, you start running into problems like
grease on lubricated surfaces evaporating, vaccuum welding
between non-lubricated metal parts, but that\'s only after a considerable
amount of time, and are easily dealt with with the proper surface coatings
and lubricants.

Oh, Memememe!

Location:        Boston, MA
Age:               1.3 years
Meeting Frequency: Once every week, usually
Group Size:        5 including ref.
Referees:         1
Health:            Stable, not stale yet.
Rules Mix:       House at this point, CT setting, T4 Character
Gen./noncombat task rules.
                      [note, rules are rarely used when role playing will
suffice]

>P.S. At what point could a group split into two adventures?
>What\'s an ideal critical mass?

There are no other GM candidates except one (despite my encouragements), We
will not be splitting or adding new players unless something really unusual
happens.

I think 4 players + 1 ref is ideal,  Each player typically has a primary
character and an "NPC" which the player controls (keeps me, the GM, from
having to run all those NPCs).  5 players inevitably resulted in one player
not getting enough "attention" from the GM or game.  6 or more were, for
me, unmanageable.  3 is fine.

Adventures eventually get "stale".  I usually counteract this by running a
3 week "hack and slash" D&D game to remind the guys how much better
Traveller is.

As far as I know, I\'m the only one of the group who\'s on the TML.
But then, all but one of my players has Internet access, so who

I have seven players and me, the ref. Two of the players run
two characters each, although the second characters won\'t be 
introduced until the next session (or the one after).

We used to run CT. Two years ago (I know, I\'m running behind) I

I think it\'s pretty good. I like to run the group in several 
adventures at once. Each adventure takes a long time to resolve
and has many sub-plots. It keeps things interesting.

I think about four to five players is optimal. Right now I have a
couple of players that don\'t do much. The other five players are
really into it and tend to "hog" the action.

I\'d argue the \'rather good\' point.  I found it to be rather bad.  
Handwaving nuclear weapons out, then rigging things so that the Arabs 
can beat the Israelis?  Fat friggin\' chance.  One of the things he 
doesn\'t factor in in that scenario is that the Egyptian Army _can\'t_ 
attack the Israelis.  We\'d withdraw all out tech support and half their 
tanks would break down in the first week.  Dupuy has too much faith in 
his precious numbers, and that makes for bad simulations.  Besides, 
he\'s a bad writer too boot.

Another question that is more ship combat related is in the same field.
Is it possible for a ship to hide in the active pulse of a sensor? Maybe I
should explain my question. A ship is running from another ship in a well
trafficated system. In trying to avoid the ships sensors while still using
HEPlaR engines, the running ship picks one of the military ships using
active sensors and positions themself right between this ship and the
follower. Would this blur out the running ship?

Well, they ran into that issue in DS, when it was discovered the French 
units were only fit to screen a flank due to their absolute inability 
to handle armored combat.

I would rule that any merc unit would want all their expences covered and
put a profit ontop of this. Crewsaleries, fuelcost (refined), ammocost
(projected on a case to case basis), and so on. All expences that the merc
unit has in pulling of the mission has to be covered, including their
downpayment on any equipment thay have. This is of course a
budget question, and there will be times when they don\'t have that much
expences, in other words their profit will be higher, and other times
there expences will run much higher possibly even pushing them into lossin
money on the mission. Any merc unit can then renegiotiate their price, but
that would be hard given the distance between the unit and their
contracter. The merc unit will decide on their profit on the basis of the
mission. Hard mission would call for high profits, to cover the risk and
the possibilty for higher costs, while simple missions would have a lower
profit overhead.

  Hackett wasn\'t writing as a novelist; there\'s some doubt as
to whether Clancy should write as anything but. I didn\'t really
realize that the thrust of the book was about conscription rather
than the state of readiness of NATO. However, it must be pointed
out that the Bundeswehr conscripted its\' manpower in a rather similar
situation to that of the U.S. in the `50\'s and `60\'s (i.e., no real
alternative to achieve mandated force levels).

  Conscription can be necessary and perhaps even desirable either in
war or peace. Pre-WW-I armies couldn\'t function without large trained
reserves (the Russians tried, and failed, repeatedly), but mechanized
warfare largely obviates the need for hordes of cheaply equipped riflemen,
as they can\'t concentrate to defeat the mech forces that will roll up
and disrupt them in effectively any quantity. That last consideration
could go a long way towards explaining why no Third World countries
today have gone the route of late 19th C. Europe in providing mass
literacy and universal male suffrage as a means of supplying itself
with the greatest military capability; the force so raised would be
both horrendously expensive (fiscally and politically) and possibly
of very limited actual military strength.

Could be that one or two players from the group want to travel to another
region  while the main group wants to stay put. This allows you to enjoy
two different settings, say one in Imperial/Regency space and one in Aslan
or Vargr space or something like that.

>>What\'s an ideal critical mass?

IMHO, six. One referee and five players. I\'ve found that five players is
the absolute most I can sustain at once. Any more and I would risk having
idle players for long periods of time during each session.

Well, my five-year-old daughter and three-year-old son are already curious
as to what the heck this Traveller pastime is all about. If I run a session
at my house, they insist on sitting on my lap to help roll dice.

My kids are avid roleplayers with their dolls and action figures and my son
loves to become Superman so he can beat the crap out "the badguy" (me), so
I don\'t think it\'s too much of a stretch that I might get them interested
in playing one day.

Not true. The Rim War crippled both sides and the Zhos won every Frontier 
War. The Imperium *could* defeat any single enemy by throwing everything at 
them, but this would leave them wide open to attack by everyone else.

Well, the Imperial authorities will want to be informed about this new

   It was a **very** poorly worded attempt to point out that some
American men who dodged the draft during the Vietnam War era did so by
fleeing to Canada.  Canada\'s extradition treaty with the US at the time
did not cover the return of those individuals for prosecution.  By far
and away the most common forms of draft dodging in the US were: 

a)  College deferment: those attending college and had filed the proper
forms with the draft board couldn\'t be drafted.

b) Joining the Natonal Guard: While the logic of joining the military to
avoid military serve might seem a bit off, in fact very few National
Guard units ever went to Vietnam.  By signing up with some admin unit in
Chicago, Illinois, you guaranteed your next assignment wouldn\'t be
Saigon.

c) Marriage: Getting married and having children significantly decreased
your chances of having to serve.  An unknown number of men went this
route.

   President Bill Clinton avoided the draft by sending a letter
commiting to sign up for Army ROTC in college (this bought you four
years before having to serve).  Later, when he signed up for college, he
neglected to sign up for ROTC, and didn\'t report his change of status
until sometime later (naturally I assume he filed for his college
deferment).

   While his was one of the more "creative" methods of draft dodging,
many other men who went on to political careers as both Democrats and
Republicans also avoided potential service in Vietnam.  

>Can we *please* get back to discussing Traveller?

   I\'m working my way slowly back to topic now...

   Does the draft exist in the Imperium (regardless of milieu)?  If so,
what exemptions are given from service?  What are the penalties for
draft dodging?  Are there worlds outside Imperial borders that offer
refuge to draft dodgers?

Regards,

Harold

Due to some writing work and my health, my campaign is currently on hold
for a few months.  It\'s set in the Lunion subsector in 1106.  Basic
merchant campaign, using the growing war scare as a push.

Assuming a high tech level (8+), there will be extensive active traffic
control sensors deployed, probably mostly in orbit (on the ground in vacuum
planets).  These would be typical technology level for the system.  At
maybe a tech level higher, there will be military bases strategically
placed around the system, and sensor pickets (SDBs) on patrol throughout
the inhabited planets and occassionally patrolling outside the protected
sphere.  These will be a mix of active and passive sensors.  Any well known
base will always* use active, since there is no use trying to hide a known
installation.  Also, major warships are often effective by their very
presence, so unless there is a specific tactical reason, most warships will
run "on active" whenon a routine patrol.  Purpose built sensor pickets will
probably not use active sensors very often.

*There are certain specific tactical occassions for shutting off active
sensors temporarily.

Not likely.  Perhaps if the military vessel were jamming the sensing ship,
but the "hard" radar return from the sensing ship is probably distinctive
enough to not be fooled by another radar pulse in the same space.  (note
that I use "radar" to cover all the AEMS possibilities.)  If the sensing
vessel had civilian sensors a TL or two lower than the military vessel, and
the military vessel specifically wished to help the fleeing vessel, and was
in relatively short range, they might be able to "burn out" the sensing
element of the civilian sensor package by overloading it.  This is probably
scientifically inaccurate, but makes good plot...and I was never one to
pass up a good plot thickener.  Remember that the fleeing vessel is even
*closer* to the military vessel when it does this, but could probably avoid
damage by shutting down its sensor array.

Conventional firearms will work perfectly well in a vacuum.

Well, nobody said that PCs were _always_ smart... :)

You might want to look at the article I wrote a year or so ago,
"Extending the UWP: Starports".  Essentially, I came up with a
"Universal Starport Profile" to describe the services available,
and also established minimums for a port to get the indicated
rating.  As I recall, there were discussions of ship construction
facilities, ship maintenance facilities, tourist and business
legal/consular/diplomatic services, amenities including but not
limited to transient residential facilities and communications
facilities, cargo handling capabilities including displacement
and live-status, fuel availability and method, and so on.
Basically, enough to flesh out a starport if you want to, or,
like the UWP itself, to use as a starting point for your
imagination.  Check it out on Freelance Traveller,
(http://www.dragonfire.net/~FreelanceTraveller/); I believe that
you\'ll find it in .../Features/RuleAnal/starports.htm or
..../starports.html

I don\'t know what the best word to describe this would be, but a
BASIC Q would be a ship designed to look like another type,
generally a weak type, but which would actually be much better
defended and armed.  This class of ship would be used for certain
kinds of covert operations (essentially the equivalent of "sting"
operations).

As an example, a Q might be designed to look like a Free Trader,
and, when "on mission" would run a Free Trader ID.  When it\'s
attacked by pirates, the pirates get a surprise; this Free Trader
is no pushover, and may (probably will) in fact get the best of
the pirate corsair ("PC" classification?).

Incidentally, this table means that the previously published
information on ship types/missions would appear to be
invalidated; a "type A2" free trader would actually appear to be
a Free Trader "UL" or "UUL" instead.

Also, how about some examples of how "traditional" ship types get
classified under this system and a one-line explanation of each
BASIC and SUFFIX?  For example, how is the yacht classified under
this scheme? UU? LU? What if it\'s carrying the ambassador from
one of the Tlakhu clans to the Imperium?  Does it then become UD?
LD? Something else entirely?  What about the X-Boat from a few
centuries down the line?  Surely, the Donosev survey vessel would
be a SS, but what about those wedge-shaped things that take a
crew of 1?

I didn\'t think the Zho\'s are communist, there is no everyone is equal, but
some are more equal of others ... They might be a bit totalitarian, only
Psions being able to rule, but not communists. I also don\'t recall there
being any mention of a controlled economy anywhere, but then I could be
wrong.

For real totalitarian, you want the Solomani, this is probably the closest
you get to communists, "Everyone is equal in the eyes of the Party!!"
unless your a member of the party, high up anyway.

I don\'t think they go in for the Marxist view of economics, (can\'t
recall if the economic system is mentioned anywhere) but the
"Democraticaly elected Government" ? (ha ... ha ... ha ... bonk (man
laughing his head off)) but if they do this to the Govenment then they
probs contoll the economy in some way as well.

As for the average solomani valuing there freedom, well ... they don\'t
realy have any do they ...

Leroy mentioned his own brilliant ability to 
"get su" on boxes he doesn\'t have an account on 
(whatever that means, I "got su" when I bought a copy
of Linux, but anyways) but I think some people on this
list have the mistaken idea that the pc-like computer
is what the whole computer industry is all about.

There are many better modern day analogies to what
Traveller "computer software" will probably look like,
without having to resort to arbitrary, wierd, handwaving
architectures.

Some examples are:

 - a TV. Yep. Apparently in a TV manufactured today,
   there\'s about 500K of code. su that.
 - SAP R/3. 
 - The software in a phone switch.
 - Flight control software in a modern jet fighter.
 - The software sitting in every \'98 Ford, GM, Chrystler, BMW, et al.

You don\'t "copy" any of these pieces of code. You steal
them. It\'s not "hacking" - it\'s industrial espionage and
if your players want to do it, it\'s a job and a half in
itself.

Besides, for most companies, software is either embedded
so deeply that it\'s invisible to the user (ie. a TV) or
it\'s sold as a loss leader. I\'m not privvy to Sun\'s
accounting books, but I bet they don\'t make a cent on 
Solaris. The bulk of the software sold by Sun serves to
promote their hardware business. The same with IBM.

Chances are that Gunnery-1 will come embedded in the
whole turret control mechanism and that you\'ll be about
as interested in copying, craking, reverse-engineering
or changing it as you would be in doing the same thing 
to the software in your pacemaker.

Once upon a time, people changed the tubes in their
radio receivers as a hobby kinda thing. One day, software
will disappear the same way that tubes did.

You should take a look at the Definitive Sensor Rules (tm) and the sensors
in FFS2 (which include really, really big sensor arrays for planetary 
installations.) 

Passive sensors are generally capable of longer range than active sensors - 
but you can hide from them by shutting down your power plant, etc. A 
planetary sensor network would rely on both. The passive sensors would be
orbital, and huge - several hundred meters in diameter or even a thousand m.
Some sensor arrays might also be deployed in free space in the outer solar
system (where Saturn is in our solar system) to get away from thermal 
background due to zodiacal dust. The active sensor arrays would be located
on the planet and generally shorter ranged.

Technically, this wouldn\'t work. HEPlaR light is UV/visible/near-IR;
active sensors emit far-IR/submillimeter/radio for the most part. Also,
active sensor pulses will be monochromatic (all one frequency) and probably
very short pulses. HEPlaR is very hard to hide...One possibility would be 
to maneuver into the exhaust of the military ship (it\'s not so dense as to
be a danger) so that the running ship\'s exhaust is mixed in and almost
undetectable...Another possibility is to use something less easily visible
(thruster plates, chemical rockets.) I might let people run their HEPlaR
"cold", with ten times normal fuel consumption and half the normal signature
penalty.

I don\'t have any problems with GURPS play mechanics. Its just that character
gen takes so long with new players. My solution to that problem is to have
a folder of varied characters, kind of like the pregened characters in
CT adventures.

Nope all firearms work in a vacuum, Guncotton is self  oxidizing.

Yep, it would work too. DS stands for Discarding Sabot, or a smallpenatrator with a collar that falls away when the bullet leaves the

To borrow a phrase, "Mega-Dittos".

The only true problem I have with Gurps as a system is converting from
"English" to metric. Hell orignal CT was in "English" measurments.

As for character gen, thats part of being a GM. I seem to rember a
player in my origenal CT campaign with JOT-1 and Handgun-7.

Am tooling up a Gurps:Traveller game right now. I have 3 playerstwo of

Gurps Combat and character gen, with FFS ships converted to usegurps
space combat. Plus various house rules.

 A second Gm and four or more players for twined adventures, or

I\'d also think that the lack of an atmosphere would contribute to the weapon 
overheating when being used in auto mode. I seem to recall something in 
connection with the shuttle or Mir about how heat dissipation is a
significant problem in space since there is no medium to convect the
heat.

Why are Zho\'s communist in your eyes? They are about as far away as you can
get. They are an oligarchy that makes no pretense as to who rules. They are
not egalitarian. They don\'t pretend to be.
Communism has, at its heart (not in reality, but that is a different post on
different list) absolute equality and, in the end , the withering away of
the state. That would be absolute anathema to the average Zho, never mind a
Noble. 

If you want "true" communist (as in Marx\'s fantasy), try the dolphins.

David Weber is pumping this creative well for all its worth and coming
up...pretty good.  At least for light "Horatio Hornblower" style sci-fi
that is.  [just noticed that Honor Harrington and Horatio Hornblower have
the same initials].  If you haven\'t read any of the other Harrington novels
I recommend the earlier ones more highly, but I found the early ones
whetted my appetite for later books.

It\'s pretty much worth the $6 cover price (never pay cover) for a quick
read.  The focus of the book is a squadron of Q-ships.  The feel is vaguely
traveller with a few exceptions.  The even use det-laser missiles for those
TNE (and T4) fanatics out there!

The plot is predictable, the characters heroic, but somewhat flat, the
action is intense, and the resolution happy.  Not to be taken seriously,
but a good time will be had nonetheless.

Trim your quote to just enough to let everybody know to what you are
replying to, as I have done here, then post below the quote.

I know it is not regular e-mail etiquette, but it is the way things are

The point to avoiding the use of active sensors is to remain
hidden. The minute you use an active sensor, you\'ve revealed your
location and, depending upon the sensor, other information about
yourself.

Since it\'s pretty much impossible to hide an entire planet, I\'d
say that worlds would use both passive and active sensors quite
freely. As for what the protecting military ships would use, that
would depend upon how far away from the world itself they are.

System defense boats hiding in gas giants wouldn\'t use active sensors,
obviously. However, those same boats in orbit around the world
in question could use them, since they have little to gain by
hiding.

Let me see if I get this right. Ship A wants to hide behind ship X
while evading ship Y. Given that situation, you have two answers:

If ships X and Y are on the same side, then this won\'t work. Ship A
would have to be so close to X that X would surely notice. In MT
combat this would be visual range.

If X and Y aren\'t on the same side, then it depends greatly on X\'s
reaction.

In general, my technique is to quote the section of message that
I am responding to, and then insert my response.  If I am
responding to several items in a message, I take them in order,
so that my text is interspersed with quoted text:

for example:

	:message text

	response

	:more message

	response

....et cetera.

Thanks, Douglas; I stand corrected (serves me right for relying on my
memory).  The TAS article definitely states that drop tanks are made
possible by "recent" advances in capacitor technology.  It further states
that "local" yards (TL-D) are not capable of constructing the new
capacitors, but are capable of building drop tanks.

Thus, for the canonical Imperium campaign, jump drives that can take
advantage of drop tanks should be available only at TL-F and/or the
post-1090 Imperial era.  This should probably be added to the FF&S2
errata, to prevent unfortunate accidents with the canon.

It\'s not in the game, it\'s a separate Map file I created. 

I made it for Marathon Infinity for the Macintosh. (Bungie didn\'t want
to do any more Marathon versions, so to emphasize the fact that it was
the final version, and that all the map and physics model creation tools
were included allowing infinitely more scenarios to be made, they called
it "Marathon Infinity" instead of "Marathon 3"... I digress...)

It should be possible to create a PC M2 version. I won\'t have time
tonight, but if you\'re interested, drop me a line at
jumpspace@geocities.com and I\'ll see if I can do it for the weekend.

Isn\'t the heat primarily generated from the friction of the round against

	Well, they\'re not exactly equivalent.  I said that we should give 
the ship owner the same "fair profit" on his investment as the bank 
because the numbers would work out that he would get close to that, and 
making it the same was convenient.
	The ship owner would have a higher return, but not really that 
much higher.  The simple fact is that he doesn\'t get the ship for 40 
years, and the discounted present value of that ship is pretty small.  
You quoted a canonical source that ships were worth 25% of the purchase 
price at the end of 40 years.  For a 100MCr ship, that\'s 25MCr.  Using 
the same interest rate the bank gets, the discounted present value of 
25MCr 40 years from now is less than 3MCr.  This means that instead of 
the 5.52% that the bank gets the ship owner gets something like 6.2% (I 
don\'t have my spreadsheet with me).  That\'s really not an earth shaking 
difference.  Considering the larger risk the ship owner is taking, its 
not an unjustified rate of return, and using the same payment schedule 
for both the bank and ship owner is convenient.

P.S. Note that I have revised my figure for the banks rate of return.  I 
discovered that I had the function set to count their loan payments as 
coming at the beginning of the year instead of the end, so they 
effectively got a discount on the ship\'s purchase price.  The new 5.52% 
figure I\'m sticking to. :-)

Yacht (a pleasure craft) should have a letter to itself (imho) Y is

Why not use B for Boat? Boat is already defined as a non-jump capable
craft. Hence System Defense Boat, which would be MB, imho.

Hans,

Wildstar posted me an interesting response to this - I believe that FFS2
isn\'t breaking canon - however it may need the clarification that
commercial use of drop tanks was not until the 1100s. IIRC High Guard
doesn\'t limit them by TL.

	This sounds right, naturally.

	If you need to shut a power plant down quickly to hide from another ship\'s
sensors, would one need to make any kind of roll to do this quickly and
succesfully?

	Also, how long would it take to restart a power plant again from idle?
What if it needs to be done quickly? Cheers.

	See ya...

Assuming that is the IIRC (if I recall correctly) you are refering to ....
The operation of the jump tunnels is described in the CORE publication \'
The Long Way Home\'. I assume that the IG version of this supplement (Long
Way Home and Gateway) has the same information in it.

T4, blended with T4.1 drafts, MT and CT. I use High Guard for ships, T4.1

Another question in the same line of thought...
When I first started playing there were no laser or gauss PISTOLs, and the laser rifles
used BACK PACK power sources. The first pistol versions were brought out in the JTAS,
and were, I\'ve always assumed, recent developments in that time period. Now EA has the
weapons using smaller belt power packs, with laser pistols at TL 11 and gauss pistols
at TL 12. Which is the correct time period for their introduction? How about the size
of the power pack? Is this an example of rewritten history?

  I\'d call the _phenomenal_ missile payload of the Su27 a more telling

  Not to mention a real nasty SR AAM mode, that allows off axis tracking

  Crew training is _the_ factor, but they still don\'t have significant
_advanced_ (ie, the Su35) assets to meet the West (or anybody else) with
and it\'s now doubtful they ever will.

   The newest Soviet fighters, and the Archer missile, were certainly a
shock to the US intelligence services though...

The best way is just to restrict the time players have.  Character
gereration doesn\'t _have_ to take more than a 1/2 hour.  It just
that players see all the choices they get and want to explore them
all.   Mot being given time to consider every possibility is certainly
no worse than not being given them at all.

I seem to remember reading somewhere that radars on aircraft can be
dangerous if someone was to walk in front of them while they were turned
on (microwaves, possibly?). Is this true? If it is, then what effect
would the hugely more powerful radar/Active EMS that are mounted on
starships have? Would the radiation be dangerous at a range that would
be useful in space combat (though probably severely lessened by armour),
or would it just be a handy way of getting rid of the unfriendly natives
without obviously shooting them? Possibly with a focussed/beam of
radiation then you could get rid of a particular individual or group
without killing all those present.

How would a person react to getting such a high dose of microwaves etc.?
Would they just fall down dead with no obvious cause at the time, or
would they take seconds/minutes/hours/etc to keel over?

Since I was an economist at the time, I decided that we\'d use the same 
monthly \'rental\' as if they were repaying a ship loan to the same value 
as the equipment, but DOUBLED - basically because of the risk involved in 
taking the gear into combat, and wear & tear!  
It worked nicely, and came up with some realistically large numbers - and 
put the pressure on the players to come up with a profit! 
It also encouraged them to make maximum use of captured enemy equipment, 
so as to avoid the costs involved in rental...
Maintenance costs we set at 1% per month noncombat, and 5% if the gear 
has been in the field. This encouraged them to deploy only the equipment 
necessary to get the job done, and to maintain a mix of infantry, 
armour and air forces...if they decided to use grav tanks and 
interceptors for every mission, they very quickly ran out of cash. 
It also forced them to work much more closely with indigenous friendly 
forces...

I suggest that the profit (ie markup after costs) should be equal to 100% 
of costs. This is for a standard, \'trained but green\' mercenary unit of 
equal TL to the enemy, and should be 
the *minimum* - it means that they are just covering their costs, and have 
a 50% chance of winning. 

After that, as you become higher tech, more experienced and so on, the 
minimum fee should increase by roughly 25% - 50% per factor, cumulative. 
Therefore each tech level above the enemy would give you eg 50% extra, 
special skills (eg underwater, vacuum, hi-G etc) another 50%, tight time 
limit on completion another 50-100% and so on.

Dom,I\'m more than willing to concede the point that this particular item could
be lost in the shuffle. I was trying to make the point, in general, that
as more material is generated in the Prequel of the M:0 era that it is
inevitable that something WILL be introduced that wasn\'t already covered by
existing Canon, and that WILL have some impact on canon. This is especially
true without a comprehensive guide for writers. It also won\'t matter one
whit to players just entering the game with T4, since they will, most likely,
not have access to the multitude of out-of-print material that, IMHO, most
of the participants on this list appear to have.

I have limited resources from the CT era, some remaining books in house, and
friends that have others. I have NOTHING from the MT era, having been in
the middle of raising a family, which made money for gaming all but nonexistent.
I picked up again with TNE, which I liked by-the-way, but couldn\'t get
players interested in, they were reluctant to by the rules and the were a bit
to complicated for the VERY irregular gaming sessions we have been playing
at.

Of  T4, I have now purchased everything currently published, I have been
converting to it\'s rules, with house revisions. But, not having the MT material
I am sure that I will someday write a game that infringes on something. I\'ve
been trying not to cross up any of the CT material, but...? Now if I were
ever lucky, or brave enough to submit anything for publication, how would I
know what went over the line. (well, in my case I think I\'d run it past the
canon police of this list but what about little Joey with only the T4 material,
and nothing else, who doesn\'t even know about the TML?)

At any rate this wasn\'t meant to be an argumentative post about what was good,
bad or indifferent in LWH or Gateway. I think they were both excellent
adventure. It was a comment to the affect that a little leeway should be given
to the new batch of writers, NOT the lousy editing and publishing!, and
that their EFFORTS should be encouraged. With the nudge in the right direction, but as constructively as possible, not raw hostility! (That way Joey,
above, when he does find the TML, isn\'t afraid to ask about correcting his
timeline. As it is now, some of the posts would scare a 20 year veteran
writer away from a second attempt, IMHO!)

Forget bridges!!!   What about the ground itself?  The Germans by 1944 had
designed a 1000mt tank powered by 4 U-boat diesels with a "projected" main

Paul,
Can\'t speak for the other oil companies, but we at Mobil Oil don\'t hide the
safe! We keep it right out in the open with 20 foot chain link fences, barb
wire and guard dogs! It\'s the combination that\'s kept hidden ;^>

I recently started this (short-lived) discussion on the DarkConspiracy 
list and we came to the "consensus" that it depends on the players and the 
GMs ability to hold their attention.  Split when two or more players can\'t 
get along (well, if they can for five minutes, deal with it; less, shoot 
\'em) -- Then run a set of "demo" adventures at your FLGS when you\'re sick 
of your players and can\'t take wasting your time on them anymore.  ;-\\

Anything short of "critical mass" is ideal... too many RW weapons lying 
about...  "Put down my claymore, damn it!  The tonfas, too!"

Yeah. Personally, I hold the view that rising real wages drive productivity
gains - if you have a red ink problem due to the Metalworkers Union getting 
a 15% pay raise, you have a *reason* to do the 12 hour days figuring more 
efficient ways to use your plant and labour. OTOH if you can solve red ink
problems by calling in a unionbusting law firm and cutting wages and benefits,
then wage costs will fall but productivity measured on a workplace level (ie
revenue == materials costs + wages + profits) will not rise.

Speaking of which, I believe Pocket Empires did a pretty good job at modelling
economic growth and technical change ... use Population rather than planetary
size as the determinant on Infrastructure costs and times and it is just about
perfect IMO (and drop that bullshit about resource trade outside a free-trade
zone. And maybe play with the World Numbers to reflect the size of the world
GDPs involved. OK, OK, it\'s a great start and great fun to fiddle with).

Guess we\'ll find out when the market has a correction, and it does seem to

It isnt quite true there was *no* other way. And by relying on a regular
freight service you have to wait for the money to come back, while the
Free Trader will offer you cash up front.

The supply of really really good gunners is going to be low ... the people
at the far end of the curve are always going to be rare.

Also, if you are trading out in the Wilds, there is no IN. You are the Navy.
Elisabeth-class type frontier traders are going to be quite common - and if
I\'m spending, what, over a gigacredit on a starship, I want someone
damn good to aim that gigawatt bay laser and protect my investment.

The Free Traders would be forced into long-haul speculative trade because
they are even more disadvantaged at short-haul trade. That one week to
find a buyer or seller is a *killer* when you average nine days trip time.
It\'s good old comparitive advantage.

Yup. Of course, once a corp *notices* that you can make good money scheduling
a freighter from Finn\'s Belt to Chanestin, the Free Trader is going to be
out of a job. But thats capitalism ;)

And time sensitivity counts for *high* value goods ... if a cargo costs
MCr1000 and interest rates are 5%, then each day you are waiting for a 
freighter costs, what KCr150 ? (ummm MCr 5 over 365 days ... close enough).
Of course, if you have a gigacredit cargo, you are goanna put some people
on board to stop hijacking. But then again, the Spanish sometimes sent
payrolls
for their armies on single ships in the 16th and 17th C (references from
Braudel on request).

You bet. Speed and flexibility count ... Jump-3 may even be viable for
this sort of trade. IMO the Jump-1 "Free Trader" would actually be more
common as a corporate design, due to it\'s standardisation and thus it\'s
ease of manufacture and availablitity of spare parts.

The other major factor is the fall in transport costs as ruling TL goes up. 
A TL-11 jump-2 Far Trader will over time cost less and less to build in
Imperial 
Credits, as the local credit of the Starport A, TL 11 world gradually falls. 
If freight costs are always set in Imperial credits, then these will fall over
time (althought this is limited at the bottom end - many worlds dont like
Fusion and HePLAR fusion drives used around here, because they have this thing
against high-velocity radioactive hydrogen being spewed about in their orbital
space).

*nod* my reading of the Marches is that by 1100 they had become a "frozen"

Yup. But for me, the vessel to do that is the workhorse Type S scout. Why

detached duty, anyway ?

If this is true, how do we then tweak our \'puters to do this or that 
better-faster-longer than they\'re programmed to do?  (I *vaguely* remember 
seeing several task for this in various Traveller systems... and, no, 
rewritable environment variable matrices don\'t cut it, either - limited 
variability that can\'t deal with entirely new params outside the program 
spec.)

Has perpetual betaware been done away with?

The ability to "re-write" at least your "non"-critical, but 
very-important, systems\' software would be too useful for folks who 
operate beyond the fringe to give up.  "Let me get this straight.  I\'m 
usually at least two months out of regular contact, I can\'t access the 
system code or fix a bug myself, but I get your \'gold-lifetime-onsite\'

I\'ve been thinking about jumping to the implications of s/w in Traveller:

* How do you call the helpdesk when you\'re gunnery program GPFs?

* How do you sue the manufacturer/publisher if you misjump into the 
"choose-your-own" Rift?

* Could you talk your AI into violating its own copy protection in an, um, 
"emergency"?  (There\'s a short story, at least, in that somewhere.)

* What do astrogators really do with all of their spare time?  Or on the 
job for that matter?

* Rather than dongle with copy.prot, haven\'t the s/w companies simply 
raised prices to the legitimate customer?  And, of course, Microfirm 
*could* persuade His Majesty to drop a legion or two of shock troops (aka 
attorneys) to persue "hard drive loading" violators in some backwater... 
 I seem to remember there being some treatment of copyright/patent issues 
in M:0 (got that new hardcover today, judgement witheld pending review).

* How long does it take for a trade secrets or patent violation case to 
get to trial?  How much does it cost?  How long are patents and copyrights 
given before they expire legally into the public domain?

* Does a ship\'s computer have any games other than Solitaire and 
Minesweeper?

** What are the Imperial subpeona laws like?  Do you still get the 
statutory MCr1 per day for showing up?  How do you find a jury of "peers"? 
 (Sorry, US judicial jargon leaking through here...)

The impression I got was that female-dominated clans were
institutionalized, but they were oriented more toward things like running
trade, training academies, or social services than butting heads and trying
to amass territory. I especially didn\'t want female-dominated clans to be
just like the males; I wanted entirely different clans.

Hmmm. I see what you mean. The non-traditional clans don\'t have to be
female-dominated, they just have to be, well, non-traditional. That\'s what
I was trying to come up with; an aspect of Aslan society we haven\'t seen
before. I just felt that Marc\'s proposed female-dominated clans would be
more likely to have an unusual social structure than the male-dominated
ones.

Having female-dominated clans is not even necessary for this. Perhaps some
remote systems aren\'t even clan-based, or are based on clans that are not
just "female-dominated" but exclusively female? A "massive ripple-down
effect" was exactly the effect I was looking for, if not in the patriarchy
then in some other Alsan social structure.

Well, I imagined them not being at all interested in "important
geopolitical topics and diplomacy and whatnot". If you can\'t buy female
clans, how about other social arrangments?

Yeah, good idea (corporations or independent clans, that is, not the WW

Well, that would contradict Newton\'s third law. Yeah, yeah, I know it\'s SF,
but why break physical laws you don\'t have to. Also, if J-space doesn\'t
have *some* potential energy change due to the N-space interaction we get
violation of conservation of energy. If it does change PE, we can use that
to get the same results.

Anyway, the original message of this thread said there wouldn\'t be any bad
effects if we let objects in J-space and N-space interact gravitationally.
That they could affect each other was an initial assumption.

I beg to differ. You don\'t cover their entire orbit, that would be silly.
The arrays maintain position just outside the jump point to the other
system. The sensors only need enough maneuverability to maintain position.
Relative motion between systems won\'t cause a problem because they are not
*accelerating* relative to each other to any great extent.

Nor does the position need be so exact. We can already measure the distance
between objects in space to a precision of a fraction of a wavelength of
light; the sensors can track accurate distances between each other and
factor them in.

True. I think Azimov described it as a "photic boom" in one story; the
signal seems to originate at the destination and travel to the origin.

The same good radio or TV, which we can\'t travel faster than, do on Earth.
Obviously you have to have the message ready before the ship arrives. Since
the interaction lasts only for a fraction of a second you can exchange
information but can\'t carry on a conversation. Also, remember this works if
the ships don\'t stop; you can communicate with ships just passing through.

It has to already be running before the ship arrives, just like any other
defensive line. You don\'t wait for the bombs to begin falling before you
build the radar station.

I didn\'t say "things" are 2D, I said "J-space" is 2D. Look at the jump
distances between systems; everything can only fit on a plane. Sure, 3D
maps are too much trouble in a game, but why is jump space 2D in the Third
Imperium? You know, the fictional universe all this stuff takes place in?
Unless you have some real world evidence about physical properties of
J-space, all the data we have about J-space is in the the Traveller
rulebooks, and every book draws jump maps on flat pieces of paper. I\'m not
trying to be snarky, the only reality about "J-space" is in the game, and
if the game shows it as 2-dimensional then it *really is*.

Why would we need such a huge grav emitter? Current technology can detect
microgravity and I would think TL 12 could do even better. Remember we\'re
not trying to move planets; we only need to make a signal which is
detectable.

As for ship\'s courses; remember the premise of this whole thing was that
ships follow straight lines through N-space while in jump. You know where
the jump points are, you can draw a straight line, you put the arrays on
the lines. And again, the message is waiting at the array before the ship
goes by.

>Assuming that gravity *in* jumpspace has any effects *on* jumpspace.

It doesn\'t need to. Remember, this was all based on the assumption that you
can have gravitational interactions between objects in J-space and N-space.
Ship A makes a gravitational signal in N-space which ship B detects. Maybe
A could interact with B directly, but it isn\'t necessary.

>Again, j-space *isn\'t* 2-d.

Maybe in your campaign, but every jump map published in every version of
Traveller is 2D. I don\'t think this is some kind of typo, but considering
MT and T4 one can never be sure.

IIRC there was a thread a few months ago trying to explain why jump maps
are 2D. The best one I heard was that jump space itself is 2D. Apparently
2-space and 3-space are of the same cardinality, so there is a 1-1 mapping
between J-space and N-space. Topographically they are very different, so I
felt it extremely unlikely that a straight line in J-space would map to a
straight line in N-space. This also explains why stars aren\'t in the same
relative positions on jump maps as in N-space. If this isn\'t canon it
should be.

of Traveller drugs so he can use them in the game.

I need to solicit opinions from you on the list.

Check out the CSC.  In it are two new drugs for Traveller--bandage and
fuzz.  

Question 1:  What TL do you think each is?  I\'m guessing TL 6 Bandage
Spray and TL 8 Fuzz Spray.

Question 2:  What do you think the cost per dose is for these two
drugs?  Pulling numbers out of the air, I\'m thinking Cr100 per dose for
the Bandage (although now I\'m thinking that may be a bit high), and
Cr400 per dose for Fuzz (that\'s seems to me to be just about right).

What do you think the answers to these two questions should be?

	I think you have the wrong roads. In germay its legal to drive
	such a beast at full speed on a german highway. Perhaps thats
	the reason that a Benz shows comfort at a speed of 130mph.
	From the bicycle point of view anything above 50hp is a waste
	of fuel.

	My SR500 normaly drinks only 4.5l for 100 miles in city usage,
	and 4l at 50mph, which is much less than any other bike I know.

	The realy insane stuff of course is "forbidden" since 15 years.
	Hercules Ultra or VanVeen Kreidler where 50ccm motorbikes, and
	50ccm without any further constrains was allowed at 16.
	Those monsters showed more than 10hp at 15.000 rpm and a
	top speed of 80mph, by a weight of less then 50 kilos.
	But of course it was fun to drive 120kmh 16 years ago ;-)

	They restricted the class 4 drivers licence to 16 years,
	80ccm, 50mph, 6000rpm.

How about the K\'Kree ?  They do everything in groups and consider the
group, not the individual.  They do, of course, have a stratified
hierarchical social structure (commoners, well born & nobles) that is
antithetical to the Marxist ideal of a class based society (But similar
to the way things actually operated in communist countries where the
nomenklatura ran things.)

Have you taken a look at the government type table ?  _All_ of the
(Imperial) Traveller government types could be communistic and for many
government types it is a probable explanation. 

Government Type

0	No Government - This could be the ultimate marxist state after 		the
state withers away.

1	Company/Corporation - This is a bit of a hard sell but remember 	that
many "communist" countries do have corporations.  This 		might represent
a planet controlled by a state owned company 		from a nearby communist
planet.

2	Participating Democracy	- This could represent a utopian 	
collectivist society.

3	Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy - A communist party whose membership 	is
hereditary.

4	Representative Democracy - Many communist counries were 		democratic
on paper.  This could also represent a society whose
	people chose elected representative to help them on their way to 	the
classless society in marxist ideology.

5	Feudal Technocracy - This could represent a world where the 		party is
in charge of technical achievement.  Can you say 		Lysenko, boys and
girls ? :)

6	Captive Government/Colony - Not an unreasonable description for 	the
governmnets of some Eastern block countries when Soviet 		power was at
its zenith.  Remember that the Soviet Union ran 		some of the eastern
block as if they were wholey owned 			subsidiaries.

7	Balkanization - Could include communism.

8	Civil Service Bureacucracy - Could represent a mild form of 	
communism or (more likely) some form of socialism.

9	Impersonal Bureaucracy - This might be a good description for 		the
actual governmnet of many "communist" nations that are not 		so lacking
in human rights as to fir in another, higher, 		government type.

A	Charismatic Dictator - A communist state run by a Stalin or a 		Mao
(see also government type F).

B	Non Charismatic Leader - A communist state run by a leader 		without
much personal appeal - can anyone out there say Brezhnev 	:)

C	Charismatic Oligarchy - The masses believe in & support the 		party,
which they allow to lead them.  If the party is 			especially harsh we
would have government type F.

D	Religious Dictatorship - If "religion" in Traveller includes 	
nontheistic ideologies than classifying many communist states as 
"Religious" dictatorships would not be far off.

E	Religious Autocracy - As government type D.

F	Totalitarian Oligarchy - This is the American stereotypical 		(with
some validity) picture of what the Russian government was 	"really" like
during the cold war.

So many people in the Imperium could be "communists".

> Why are the Zhos communists (except for their evilness, badness
> un-americanness etc)?

The Zhodhani are the bad guys.  The Imperium is the "good" guys. 
Traveller was written in the 1970\'s therefore its bad guys _must_ be
communists :)

A suggestion: Since "High Guard" allowed drop tanks at any TL (above 8,
of course), and since there are canonical designs with drop tanks at
lower than TL 15, say that the early prototypes -- the first generation 
of these new capacitors -- requires TL 15 (or 14) to build. They also
have to be discharged almost immidiately after having been charged,
which leads to dangerous situations if the decoupling goes wrong. The
next generation -- once all the bugs are ironed out -- can be built at
TL 9. This version can retain the charge for several hours before 
having to be discharged (the kind described in _Starship Operator\'s
Manual_).

Oh, an you should also allow a decidedly dangerous version before 1090
to account for the Scout ship that got away from the Islands Cluster
(A 1-in-36 risk of disaster may be acceptable to castaways anxious to
get home to their loved ones, but would be completely unacceptable for
commercial use).

On the other hand, sit down and figure out how much "parking space"
there is at the 100 diameter limit. It\'s far quicker to have the
couriers "parked" out there and "beam" the news to them via radio or
laser rather than have them closer and then have to waste time getting
to where they can jump.

Well, given the fact that even genetically determined roles sometimes
get "mixed", I\'d suspect that the Aslan would have some provision for
the (rare) male or female with the wrong "program". Most likely the
male computer programmer would have been "ritually" made a female, and
vice versa for the female warrior.

Societies *have* to have escape valves for those who "don\'t fit". The
Aslan society seems far too stable to not have such safety valves.

Such "exceptions" would be rare, and unlikely to be player characters.
But they\'d be great for a one time encounter to rattle your players a
bit.

That sort of leaves the women with a choice between wearing an
indwelling cath while "on call" or putting up with the mess from the
"funnel" type gizmos (complete with adhesive edges, and a great way to
get infections).

Well, Jordin Kare was still optomistic the last time I heard him talk

I can picture a world going ahead with a laser launch system simply
because the required laser installations would make a nice part of a
planetary defense system. The sort of thing that\'d make higher tech
worlds decide that it\'s easier to trade than raid. In short, just what
you might expect to find in the "Wilds" during and after the Long Night.

Gunpowder supplies its *own* oxygen. The only change needed to make
most firearms function in vacuum is to change the lubricant. And for
gas-operated actions, you\'d have to adjust the gas ports.

The lube change is just to get one that doesn\'t get gummy, or dry out
in vacuum. Much like you have to change lube for Arctic use, to keep
the action from gumming up.

> (BTW, can someone explain to me what DS amo is ?
> Discarding sabot...???...) I think probably not.

Yep. Discarding Sabot. They make DS ammo for *shotguns* right now, and
I\'ve heard talk of them for some of the larger rifle calibers.

> Would grenades work?

Yes and no. You wouldn\'t get much blast effect unless you were right on
top of the grenade. Shrapnel effects would be normal (actually, the
shrapnel would carry farther, but probably not enough farther to make a
special rule about).

Smoke grenades would be pretty weird, as smoke is small *solid*
particles suspended in the air. In a vacuum, a smoke particle drops at
the same speed as a rock. So the smoke would fall rapidly to the ground
and lay there!

In free fall, it\'d just spread out in a spherical cloud and disperse
rapidly (as there\'s no air resistance to keep it from spreading out
indefinitely).

BTW, a paintball gun could be nasty in a vacuum. Shoot someone in the
faceplate and the paint covers it and dries almost instantly. Kinda
hard to see out of a paint covered faceplate. :-)

I have this picture of a bunch of "street punk" types with "harmless"
paintball guns harassing the off-worlders who are intruding on their
turf. Wouldn\'t the players be surprised. :-)

It would have been even more convenient if I had known this before I
redid all my original calculations (which did give the owner and the
bank the same payments). Sigh... Well, I\'m not going to redo then again
just yet. But I\'ll do it in any future calculations.

The bank gets its payments in monthly rates (at the end of the month).
Does that affect the figure? ;-)

Well, I\'d say that active sensors would cover things out to the 100
diameter limit (and a bit beyond), and do so from several locations and
at different wavelengths. This would be for traffic control purposes,
but it\'d do nicely for defense purposes.

The locations and courses derived from this info would normally be
being broadcast on several standard frequencies, so as to let ships
minimize use of their own ative sensors (and thus reduce the inevitable
interference that would otherwise result).

In wartime, the broadcasts would be encrypted, so the local forces
could pick up the data while staying passive, but invaders would have
to rely on active sensors (giving away their positions), or else
proceed more cautiously using passive sensors.

Among other "tricks", a lot of things normally IDed as dead satellites
awaiting salvage, or other large but harmless items may turn out to be
camoflaged SDBs! So even if you have a copy of the "orbital inventory"
from before the start of hostilities, it may not be something you want
to trust a lot.

If another ship in the area is using active sensors, you\'ll set yours
to use a different wavelength. This is to prevent getting "blinded" by
their pulses. So that sort of kills your idea.

	Most firearms are likely to work normally in vacuum, except
	that projectile will not be slowed down by aerodynamic drag,
	and thus the projectile will retain its velocity and be lethal
	in longer ranges than in atmosphere.

	However, fin-stabilized projectiles (which require aerodynamic
	drag for stabilization) will not be stabilized in vacuum. The
	accuracy of these projectiles would not greatly affected (the
	aerodynamic drag would make unstabile projectiles inaccurate, but
	in vacuum the projectile may fly side-on with no ill effects), but
	the penetration value would be reduced (unstabile projectiles may
	strike the target in oblique angles).

> (BTW, can someone explain to me what DS ammo is ?

	DS means Discarding Sabot, which means that the projectile consists
	of a sub-caliber penetrator which is surrounded by a light, full-
	caliber sabot.

	In modern DS rounds the sabot is 3-4 part plastic "bullet" which
	grips the nose of the penetrator. The penetrator is long fin-
	stabilized dart (hardened industrial nail with pressed fins).
	The penetrator is usually placed within the cartridge case, so that
	the finned tail stands on the primer base, the penetrator body is
	surrounded by the powder charge and the nose is held within the
	bullet-shaped sabot.

	When the saboted projectile exists from barrel, rifling-induced
	spin strips off the sabot, leaving the narrow metal penetrator
	flying alone towards the target.

	The discarding sabot round used by Steyr ACR (Advanced Combat Rifle)
	is called "5.56mm SCF" (Synthetic Cased Flechette).

Not many, but that wouldn\'t be the news the corporations would be most 
anxious to get fresh anyway. That would be stock market information.
Consider the advantage someone with a 100 day head start on the stock
market would have and you\'ll begin to see why no corporation would allow
a competitor to get their news ahead of themselves. 

>Are you going to keep a staff pilot and ship standing by year round on the

That\'s what some of what I call the "small" players would do. People like
Duchess Delphine and Duke Leonard and the other planetary rulers whose
military budget allow them a fleet worth upwards of 35 million MCr. Keeping 
one courier permanently on standby at Capital would require 4 couriers in 
all. I think you\'d be able to pay for that out of 35 trillion credits,
don\'t you?

>...Also, what happens if *another* decision is made while the first pilot 
>is making the round trip to MC HQ?  

That would be a problem, of course, which is why megacorporations would
have a courier network  --  one or even two couriers per jump along the
route. That does run into money, and even Megacorporations would
propably not do more than link their regional headquarters to their
main offices, relying on the X-boats for cross-imperial messages, but
that they can afford. Oh, concievalby they may even club together and 
have only one network that carried all their traffic, although there
are problems of trust and control involved in a shared network. Certainly
all of them would have a few private couriers for those really secret
messages in addition to a shared network. 

>Or while the ship is going through maintenance?  

That\'s why I calculate with 4 couriers to keep one permanently on standby
on Capital.

>How many couriers do you keep in orbit?  

A stand-by courier wouldn\'t keep in orbit. It would be stationed on the
ground. A network courier would be in orbit.

>Then, of course, there are the ships themselves.  J6 ships (TL 15 by
>definition) can only be produced at a relatively few shipyards.  

Any single high-population world has the shipyard capacity to build 
enough couriers to serve the whole Imperium.

>They are expensive, and haven\'t a shot in hell of recouping the cost.  

People like rulers of worlds wouldn\'t care and a commercial courier network
would repay itself handsomely.

Well, if you are talking of _Imperial_ Trade Minister Vlea\'s wife, why
don\'t she use her husband\'s private yacht? This is one of the top 100
people of an empire of 15 trillion inhabitants you\'re talking about.
You can bet he has his own private yacht. And if that is tied up, you
bet again that he will be able to get the Navy or the Scouts to oblige.

>For example, you are the vice president in charge of the Core Sector and,

Why not take your private yacht? Tukera\'s Vice President in charge of Core
Sector would have a yacht. Not that he\'d need to use it. The main office of 
any megacorporation will have a ship or two attached for just this sort of
occasion. You just haven\'t realized just how many resources a mere piddling
sector-wide company would have, much less a mega-corporation. They are
litterally astronomical.

Why go a week\'s way out of communication range when you can station

OK, there _may_ be only one commercial courier network jointly financed by
a lot of corporations, but there _will_ be a way for the corporations to
get their news as fast as damn well possible, and the Megacorporations
will all of them have a number of private couriers for all those truly
secret and sensitive communications.

a cross over between Traveller and Mechwarrior?

Mechwarrior doesn\'t have rules for building starships etc and concentrates
on mechs and mech pilots, I was thinking of using the Mechwarrior background?
any comments?
anybody interested?

OK. But how would one go about calculating the cost of the starship?
What would be the cost to *rent* it? 1%, 5%, 10% of the purchase
price?  My rough calculations show that hiring a merc unit, using a
Mercenary Cruiser, could easily cost MCr20 for 2 weeks of operation
(assuming 2 weeks spent in jump, to get to and from target site). It
can get pretty expensive!

BTW, thanks for all the responses.

The Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0. rulebook has some pretty interesting ideas about
cybernetics.  It is, of course, "over the top", especially compared to
Traveller.  Take out anything that is "monomolecular" and attempt to
"realistically" accomodate the power requirements of the rest of the stuff
and you will end up with some pretty good travelleresque implant
possibilties.  Oh, and raise the cost by a large factor and only allow it
at TL 12 and up.

This is science fiction after all.  Certain enhancements, like added
strength or artificially accurate/telescopic eyeballs, are pretty easily
fit into the Traveller genre.  I would also expect to find people with
crystaliron plates replacing their breastbone and skull sections, "plug
- -ins" for computer interface, et al.   I would *not* expect laser eyeballs,
weapons concealed in metallic arms, or other hollywood type enhancements.
And lifting heavy objects is as much dependent on the person\'s whole
skeletal structure as it is on the strength on one arm, so no "Steve
Austin" manuvers either, where he lifts a big truck off someone.

I wouldn\'t want to get punched in the face by an enhanced arm though.

First off, they would probably have some radio beacons 100 diameters
out, broadcasting approach instructions. Probably have some active
sensor satelites also beyond the 100 diameter to properly monitor
space trafic. Trafic control at the main SP would probably have an
eye open for suspicious activity.

Yep, its excellent -- and I had to pay A$30 (around US$25 IIRC) because I had to
pay surface shipping from the US and wait two months. I *could* have paid A$40
(US$30) and got it locally within days.

Why don\'t you try Amazon.com (which is where I ordered mine), they were
discounted 10% then, maybe more now if its hit the bestseller lists (I
pre-ordered mine).

I rarely but hardcovers -- but have for the last two HH books and have not been
disappointed at all!

Yes, I know -- and this has always been one of my pet hates about Traveller. I
know that we repeated it in Space Opera -- and pretty much everybody since has
done the same (some actually doing it worse!), but I do think that there are
better ways of doing it.

The World Builder\'s Handbook by DGP was a good start, but too complex in many
ways. Personally, in the design I am intermittently working on, I assume that
there are going to be only three or four major Interstellar "Tech Levels" --
each based around one of the three or four major Intestellar States -- and that
the rest are sort of like being at a US Army Base in Turkey ... the US is TL9,
Turkey is TL7 (say), but the soldiers can get TL12 stuff at the PX, and the
locals can buy TL9 computers by importing them. If Jump/FTL Travel for cargo is
as cheap as it is in Traveller (and I intend to be at least as cheap in my
background), then it seems to me that proximity to a High TL world makes local
TLs somewhat problematic (I know that many people on this list object vehemently
to this interpretation, but its one that *I* like ... and I\'m *not* saying
anyone should adopt it ... so stay calm!!!).
