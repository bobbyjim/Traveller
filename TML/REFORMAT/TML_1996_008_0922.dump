simonm@ramhb.co.nz (Simon) has written several times discussing an ambitious
and intersting traveller map viewer project;  here\'s my two Arcturian
dollars worth:

Please consider storing the data in an "open" database format (I hesitate to
suggest MS .mdb, but they have been flogging the tools in a couple of
development environments of late, and it seems to be adequate with resonable
ammounts of data).  This would:

1. Allow easy extension by customers.  For example, it would be childs play
to add reporting using standard report writers.  If I want a list of Tech
level 7 oligarchies with class A spaceports and a gas giant,  I don\'t have
to go whining in your email box for it.

2. Make it easy to put generators in front of your system by diectly filling
the table.

I can think of other ways a relational back-end database could be used to
provide effective customization by the user without violating the integrity
of your system.  If you are using an OO design, do not believe the people
who tell you that relational databases and objects don\'t mix.

Just a thought based on how I would do it, anyway.

Hope this helps some of you.

I\'m going to work on getting a Website dedicated to the Reformation
Coalition.  I hope to include any Public Domain items that anyone has come
up with for the RC.  I have heard rumors of RICE style papers on some of the
worlds.  If anyone has some, let me know, and I\'ll include them.  Also,
anyone that has a Traveller website, let me know what it is, and I\'ll
include a like to you.

Dushgin & Delgado Corporation

Dushgin Starship was a small independent starship manufacturing yard
located in the Vras System (Old Expanses 0739 A78A773-F).  Dushgin Starship
was a privately owned small company that encountered cash flow problems
during the starship boom of 1087.  Ling Standard Products purchased the yard
and retained the existing management and Dushgin became a major producer of
starships in the Old Expanses Sector.  Dushgin specialized in small craft
and starships (under 500 displacement tons) with its specialty being 100-ton
craft and smaller.  Compared to many of her sister yards (including the
larger Nicosia Yards located in the Nicosia system), Dushgin was a small
operation.  Most of the other Ling Shipyards can build anything from 100 to
10,000 displacement tons.  As Dushgin\'s orders increased, the management
utilized Ling\'s capital to pre-order many of the components required to
construct the smaller spacecraft that had become Dushgin\'s bread and butter.
At the same time, Dushgin purchased a small moon orbiting the gas giant in
the Vras system.  All of the components were housed in the warehouse
facility located on the moon, called Dushgin\'s moon.  In addition to the
orbital shipyards, Dushgin constructed a surface construction sight in Vras\'
southern ocean to construct many of the spacecraft that it had backordered.
During the Final War, Dushgin received a contract to design and build
sixteen 400-ton SDB\'s for Vras.  Most of the materials were pre-purchased
and stored in the warehouse on Dushgin\'s moon.  By 1130, five of the sixteen
had been completed and three others were under construction.

In late 1130 when Virus reached Vras and infected the five SDB\'s, two of
the five destroyed themselves and the orbital facility.  The other three
destroyed parts of Dushgin\'s moon warehouse by crashing.  The surface
facility fared much better.  Its computer was down for minor repairs and the
plant was unmanned when Virus arrived, so all the systems were untouched
when Virus invaded the planet\'s network.  The destruction of the planet\'s
power grid; however, severely limited Dushgin\'s production capability.

After Virus wiped itself out and the main cleanup/rescue operations were
complete, Dushgir resumed the production of the 30-ton cargo tender it had
been working on at the surface facility.  Production was severely slowed
because the only power source available was the tenders power plant.

It wasn\'t until early 1132 that  the 30-ton cargo tender was finished.  The
tender was sent to Dushgin\'s moon to salvage what was left of the materials
there.  When the tender arrived at the moon, it discovered that there was
much less damage than originally anticipated.  Three J-1 Free Trader type
ships were intact, left on planet awaiting final payment before delivery.
Two J-1 Scout/Courier type ships (property of Delgado Trading, LIC, docked
pending repainting and minor repairs) were found intact.  The Jump drive
parts warehouse had been destroyed, as had the main office building and
parts of the electronics and maneuver parts warehouses as well.  The J-1
ships were taken to the planet as were many of the parts and a few in-system
cargo tenders.  Dushgin lent the three J-1 ships to the Vras branch of
Delgado Trading, LIC to add to the two they had repaired to help maintain a
loose network of trade with Fuetz, and later (in 1139) with Schall.  Much of
the limited ability of the surface facility were committed to maintaining
the small fleet of J-1 boats.

By 1143, the management of both Dushgin Starship and Delgado Trading began
negotiations to merge the two companies, believing that they were all that
was left of their respective megacorporations.  After many problems in the
negotiations, an agreement was finally reached in 1145.  Under the
provisions, Dushgin & Delgado Corp was born.  Dushgin & Delgado busied
itself with trade(interstellar/insystem/surface), maintenance of the fleet,
and production of surface cargo transports.

By 1169 Dushgin & Delgado controlled much of the surface merchant traffic
on Vras and all of the Interstellar trade.   Vras was creeping back towards
a prestellar technology level.  Dushgin & Delgado had trade with TED\'s on
both Fuetz and Schall and operated a slight amount surface merchant traffic
on both of those worlds.

As repair parts dwindled, Dushgin & Delgado lost the use of its two J-1
Scout/Couriers:  the management was not willing to risk the crew without the
ability to verify the safety of the J-Drives.   These ships were added to
the in-system fleet that serviced the three remaining J-1 vessels.

In 1189, Plans were drawn up to redesign Dushgin\'s moon into a complete
starship yard.  The shipyard would build 50-200 ton ships, specializing in
Traders and Couriers.

In late 1190, Dushgin & Delgado experienced another setback, one of the
three remaining Free Traders misjumped.  The crew was thrown many parsecs
away and were it not for the skill of the engineer and astrogator, the ship
& crew would have been lost.  The crew was able to install a J-2 drive into
the ship, and, by removing some of the cargo to make room for fuel, the crew
and ship returned safely (for details, see upcoming adventure, MisJump).
When the crew finally made it back to Vras in early 1191, they were given a
hero\'s welcome and given the rest of the year off with pay.  Dushgin &
Delgado Corp, however, wasted no time using this new Drive to make a profit.
Trade was soon established with Vezinan TEDs, and Dushgin & Delgado Corp
established a small amount of surface trade on Vezina.

Later in 1191, when the Hivers first arrived in the Vras system, they were
met by the Dushgin & Delgado Corp donated(lent) in system Navy.  Dushgin &
Delgado Officials were in on the initial discussions with the Hiver, and
sent many upcoming young students and employees to the Hiver tech schools in
1192.  Dushgin & Delgado officials were instrumental in developing the
trading missions  sent out by the Dawn League, and even provided crewmembers
for some of the ships at their own expense.

By 1202, Dushgin & Delgado runs the premier spacecraft facility on Aubaine;
at the surface facility they design and build spacecraft, 10 to 100 tons,
for civilians and governments.  The facility for building 100 to 200 ton
starships on Dushgin\'s moon was completed in late 1194 and launched it\'s
first starships (100 ton J-2 couriers for the RC Mail Service) in mid 1199.
Dushgin & Delgado also runs a number of smaller facilities designed to build
10 to 50 ton surface transports.

Dushgin & Delgado has many family ties to the Aubaine, Schall, Phoebus, and
Vezina Councilmembers, and many of the Councilmembers hold seats on the
parchment board (see below) of Dushgin & Delgado.  The company\'s involvement
with the respective world governments existed even before the Hiver
reconnected humans, so it was only natural that Dushgin & Delgado have a
part in the formation of interstellar government.

Corporate Strategy:
Dushgin & Delgado is an extremely enthusiastic expansionist company.  Most
of the company\'s policies are designed to make it easy for Dushgin & Delgado
to enter new markets and broaden its base of income.  Dushgin & Delgado
wants to be the cornerstone of  the RC expansion to take back the stars.
Dushgin & Delgado doesn\'t approve of any illegal activities by Board member
or corporate official, and any Board member or corporate official involved
in illegal activities will be openly reprimanded and expelled.  However, if
an activity will make a profit and not endanger the life of employees,
Dushgin & Delgado will look the other way while an employee does the dirty
work.  There are three things to remember about this profit making:

1.  If it will endanger the lives of Dushgin & Delgado employees not
directly involved, IT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED.  If RC citizens are at risk, it
better be a healthy profit.  (This means dangerous, harmful drugs
("Anagathics and Osi-drugs aren\'t dangerous, they\'re beneficial") and
illegal weapons supplying are taboo, although the company does have a secret
weapons supply to the rebels on Spencer and Oraflamme, but that activity is
politically motivated.)
2.  If the employee(s) involved is caught, Dushgin & Delgado Corp will
respond as strongly against his actions as when an official or board member
engages in the activity.
3.  With Dushgin & Delgado having so many ties to the RC government
structure, this is rarely a problem.  There are very few illegal activities
that meet the criteria of #1 above.

Dushgin & Delgado looks at its employees and profit in similar ways.  "They
are the reason we are in business."
Employees:
1.  Without happy employees, you can\'t be productive.  Without
productivity, you cannot make a profit.
2.  An employee that is being treated fairly will be a happy productive
employee.
(Note:  This is somewhat contradictory to  the way employees are treated if
they are involved in illegal activities.)
Profit:
1.  Without profit a business cannot exist
2. Without profit, there is no reason to exist.

Dushgin & Delgado is a strong proponent of the Federalist movement.  "When
rulers hoard the technology, they are hampering trade and trade provides
profit."

Corporate Structure:
Dushgin & Delgado Corp is run by a board of twenty-five directors.  Each
director gets one vote in matters of corporate policies.  Five of the
positions (the Ruling Five) are lifetime and are held currently by members
of the families that ran Dushgin & Delgado.  When any one of these members
dies, the other four choose his successor preferably from the family, but if
no suitable family member is available, an outsider may be brought in.  To
date, no outsiders have been brought in.  The remaining members (Council of
Twenty) of the board serve five year terms and must be re-elected each five
years.  They are re-elected (4 per year) by the rest of the board with the
Ruling Five having one vote each and all other members not up for
re-election having 1/8 vote each.  If a member of the Council of Twenty dies
before his term is up, another member is elected for a shortened term using
the method described above.

In addition to the board of directors, Dushgin & Delgado also has a board of
advisors comprised of government and civilian leaders, as well as leaders of
other corporations (no competitors and usually people Dushgin & Delgado
wants to influence).  The board of advisors, also known as the Parchment
Board, gets no vote in corporate policies.  The board of directors, however,
respects the advise they get from the Parchment Board (they don\'t
necessarily follow it, but they respect it).  The members of this board are
not paid directly; however, in addition to the annual meetings of this
board, Dushgin & Delgado pays for each of the members to go on a one week
vacation together with the board of directors.  Members of this board are
chosen each year at the first board of directors meeting.  Inclusion to this
board has been limited to 100 members, but has on occasion been stretched
overthe limit.  The vacation this board attends is seen as a status symbol
on many RC worlds.

The day to day operations of the company are run by the president and
vice-presidents.  An organizational chart is available upon request.

While the stockholderd (or their heirs) are still listed as the company\'s
owners, the board of directors has all the rights associated with ownership.
Practically speaking, The Ruling Five are the owners of Dusgin & Delgado.

Competition:
Dushgin & Delgado Shipbuilding (55%):
Dushgin & Delgado Shipbuilding has little in the way of competition.  Most
of the other shipyards are so backlogged building larger ships for the
Government that Dushgin & Delgado has carved itself a nice little niche in
the Spacecraft and small starship market.  The small companies that are in
direct competition with Dushgin & Delgado are usually not large enough to be
much competition and usually handle the backlog from Dushgin & Delgado.
When a small shipyard does begin to threaten Dushgin & Delgado, they are
usually driven out of business by Dushgin & Delgado\'s aggressive price
slashing.  Dushgin & Delgado then gobbles up the facility, hires the
employees back and resumes operations.  When the RC discontinues building
larger ships with such furvor, Dushgin & Delgado expect the competition to
increase, but they hope to have a solid niche carved into the market by then.

Dushgin & Delgado Trading(40%):
Dushgin & Delgado Trading has carved itself a niche as the prime mail
carrier for the RC.  There are very few other trading companies that provide
any direct competition to Dushgin & Delgado.  Transstar is the only company
with enough power to compete with Dushgin & Delgado; however,in the booming
economy of the Reformation Coalition, both companies have more than enough
business to keep them both busy.  Corporate rivalry exists more on a
political level than a competitive level; however, the competitive rivalry
is growing though.  Most of the other competition to Dushgin & Delgado comes
from the Free Traders that make the RC a regular port of call.  The quantity
of these traders is so small, that Dushgin & Delgado actually makes money on
their visits to most worlds.  The goods delivered by the traders are
offloaded at the starport and moved by Dushgin & Delgado surface transports.
Dushgin & Delgado has a marginal surface fleet/insystem fleet on most of the
worlds of the RC and these transfers of materials from free traders at the
starport to its final destination is highly profitable for Dushgin &
Delgado.  By the same token, the surface and insystem transfers that other
companies handle are usually transfers of Dushgin & Delgado shipped goods.
Either way Dushgin & Delgado makes money on most everything shipped in the
RC whether interstellar or insystem or surface.  (Note:  Dushgin & Delgado
rents large garages at most planets auction facilities and most of the items
bought at auction are moved by Dushgin & Delgado transports).

Diversification(5%):
Dushgin & Delgado has begun to diversify into other industries.  Primarily,
Dushgin & Delgado is moving into banking, entertainment, and
pharmaceuticals.  Dushgin & Delgado\'s interests are small, but growth in
each industry is steady.

Adventure Hooks:

See Transstar

Also:
Stolen Merchandise:  The PCs are hired to be guards for a valuable shipment
and while they are guarding the merchandise, it is stolen.  The PCs are
threatened with breach of contract (or something similar) if they do not
recover the merchandise.

Rebel:  The PCs either stumble onto or are introduced to Dushgin & Delgado\'s
secret supply line to the rebels on Spencer and Oraflamme.  They may be
hired to help, or they may have already been hired to uncover the supply
line.  When they inform their superiors (if they inform) they will have
trouble getting action done because of the relationship between the RC
government and the Dushgin & Delgado leaders.   (Note: The more vehemently
the PCs fight Dushgin & Delgado, the more vehemently Dushgin & Delgado will
fight to silence the players.  D&D will not lose this one.)

Russell,

I wrote to Marc mid February. The reason that we havent heard much from
him is because
(a). He doesnt log into his account often.
(b). He is still finalizing plans for the re-release for Traveller.
     (Folks, AFAIK the re-release is going to be called.... Traveller!).
     This wont be done until mid-march.

Basically he knows this list exists. We\'ll hear from him when he\'s
good and ready! :-)

And for those who still dont have his address its:

FarFuture@aol.com (if my memory serves me rightly)

Hope that helps,

Mark

I have made a spreadsheet for excel do design spacecraft and starships. I
have decided to go for rating the acceleration in thrust vs weight rather
than fixed size drive for a fixed size hull.

The problem that arises is that there may be a large difference in the
weight of a loaded ship versus an empty ship. Thus the fuel consume
changes accordingly. What I feel is the best solution is to take the
thrust and dividing it on the average weight of the craft. What do you
think?

Progress Report

I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to (more people than I can
count) who has responded to my several posts asking for input about Traveller
in this time of change for the system. The emails and posts I have received
offering support, constructive criticism, and general advice have been
extremely helpful to me in coming to decisions about what I am going to do
with Traveller and how I am going to set about doing it.

Now, I know that I will not be able to please every single one of you out
there, so after considerable thought, I have come to the obvious conclusion
that I should please myself and believe that in doing so I will also please
those who like and appreciate the game system which I created.

Under to terms of various agreements between myself and GDW, I have always
held all rights to the games and intellectual properties which I created.
Game Designers\' Workshop has decided to close its doors, and as it closes
down, the company has formally transferred to me all rights to the Traveller
game system (including Traveller, MegaTraveller, and Traveller The New Era).
Included in that transfer are the licenses and contracts between GDW and
various licensees. That transfer took place yesterday (February 29, 1996). So
that part is official.

I had thought that I would have the additional details completed by
yesterday, and that I would have a formal announcement to make about who will
be publishing Traveller by today, but I do not. Too many people have been
interested in participating (with more coming out of the woodwork at the last
minute) for the various agreements to be negotiated and signed. You may see
rumors about what is going on (and many of them will probably be true), but
it is bad form to announce things before the papers are signed, so I need to
wait a little while longer.

  Traveller is slated to make it\'s triumphant return in August of 1996, just
in time for GenCon! Far Future Enterprises owns the rights to Traveller
itself; Imperium Games has the paper publishing rights.
   The system is, as has been stated, a return to Classic Traveller at it\'s
base, but with numerous improvements and enhancements. They\'ll be adding to
character generation, adding skills, and a whole new look.
   Lester Smith (of 2300 AD fame) will be Traveller Developer.
   Larry Elmore will be doing the black-and-white interior artwork.
   Greg Porter (of BTRC and GUNS, GUNS, GUNS fame) will be developer of
equipment.
   Don Perrin (from MagForce 7) will be in charge of developing spacecraft.
   Tim Brown (of long-ago GDW fame) will be the main developer of Aliens.
   Jean Rabe (formerly of RPGA) will be the editor of the new Journal of the
Traveller\'s Aid Society, starting from where the GDW numbering of JTAS (not
Challenge) left off.
   More system stuff: no dying during creation. More skills will be offered,
as well as chances to develop your personal background.
   Everything can be rolled OR chosen. More control over character creation.
   The task system from MT will be used.
   Background packages allow more skills at start, even if you\'re a kid!
   Format for all books will be 8.5" by 11"
   The name of the system: TRAVELLER.
   The new game\'s initial setting: year Zero!! And looking up the old data
won\'t help you-GM\'s will now be coming up with their own stuff!
   There will be a Collector Card Game AND a Comic series!!
   There will be a FF&S-like supplement; Greg Porter is in charge of that.
   A ship combat boardgame is slated for August \'97.
   They plan on releasing two products a month for a year. One will be a
rules addenda, the other a background add-on.
   The plan is to have a book by Don Perrin and Margaret Weis in a year or two.
   They will be returning to the Virus Era in about 3 years, maybe sooner.
   There was a HINT of something involving TV or movies!!
   The first 14 supplements have been planned; that information is
forthcoming to the TML as soon as I or someone else gets ahold of it.
   DGP has appently accquired rights to the SEEKER and old FASA materials,
and is planning on releasing it on CD-ROM.
   There will be a new Traveller boardgame in the Imperium tradition in
August of 1997.

   All of this stuff is straight from Imperium Games. I\'m excited about a
lot of this. I hope you are too.

I\'m not sure I get what you\'re saying... you imply (I think) that
they\'re still using the framework of the Imperium, et al (ie:  the
timeline and canon), but this bit confuses me a little.

Do you have an more info?

Imperium Games, Inc. presents
Marc Miller\'s  Traveller

Since its original publication in 1977, Traveller has been the
pre-eminent science-fiction role-playing game, providing ways to play in
role-playing, board games, miniatures, and computers. After 23 years,
GDW (the original publisher of Traveller) has closed its doors and the
Traveller game system has reverted to its originator and designer. The
vision Marc Miller has for Traveller is three fold; a comprehensive
rules system, continually expanding background and history, and a wide
variety of products in print, electronic, and other media.

Imperium Games occupies the central position in this plan and is
responsible for producing, under the direction of Marc Miller, the
foundation for the system. Here are some of the titles under
consideration.

TRAVELLER
The Traveller game system rules will be consolidated and restated based
on the original and classic Traveller rules (revised in light of 20
years of role-playing experience). This foundation for every Traveller
player and referee will include a task system and an emphasis on
reasoned simplicity for players and progressive layers of complexity for
referees. Marc Miller.

STARSHIPS
Turn to this reference for detailed information about the starships of
the Traveller universe: statistics, ship names, anecdotal information,
illustrations, deck plans. Don Perrin.

CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOG
The original Traveller game has never had a complete listing of
equipment.  By compiling equipment listed in all published books , and
adding to that with original material, we are creating the basic
reference for equipment every player character needs. Greg Porter.

ALIENS ARCHIVES
Traveller has produced volumes of information on the universes many
alien races, however, we plan to include several more minor races.  By
compiling old materials, as well as adding a alien race generation
system, players can integrate alien races into their travels and
adventures. Tim Brown.

MILIEU 0: The Third Imperium
The essential background for adventuring in Traveller is provided in a
number of Milieu books, each detailing an era in the long history of
mankind in space. Milieu 0 chronicles the emergence of the Third
Imperium from the Long Night, extending its reach to re-explore and
re-conquer the vast interstellar territories that have been untouched
for 1700 years. Covers the early years of the Third Imperium, its
history, structure, economics, and library data. Also includes many
adventure hooks and adds direction to players and Referees. Marc Miller.

Other Milieu Books will include (among others): The Aslan Border Wars,
The Vargr Wars, The Barracks Emperors, The Rule of Man, Ziru Sirkaa, The
Solomani Rim War, The Zhodani Core Expeditions, and The Interstellar
Wars.

FIRST SURVEY
This vital companion to Milieu 0 is an atlas of the 50 or so sectors
that were the Vilani Empire and its surrounding territories. The star
systems of the Sylean Federation are well defined. Farther and farther
out, systems are less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines
its own survey results for each system they visit. Lester Smith.

Third Imperium Weapons
Players and Referees will be thrilled to buy this complete book of
Imperium weapons. Weapons include melee, small arms, heavy weapons and
artillery. This guide will include graphic detail and history behind the
weapons use in the Imperium. Greg Porter.

Adventure Class Ships
Now it is time to add some detail to the players lives with this
complete book of Adventure Class ships.  Not only will this book supply
a player with new 100+ ton ships, it allows them to design their own
ships, just the way they want them. Don Perrin.

Anomalies
The records of the past don\'t mesh with what should be out there. This
is the first EPIC adventure designed specifically for the Referee in
mind. Marc Miller.

Pocket Empires
When Cleon established the Third Imperium, he never expected he would
have competition from his own scouts, merchants, and naval officers.
Thousands of adventurers tried to conquer worlds and establish their own
empires in the vast, uncharted territories not yet under Imperial rule.
Strategic level rules for establishing Pocket Empires. Marc Miller.

Handbook of the Psionic Institutes
When the Psionic Institutes began studying this abstract science, they
just didn\'t know what a bag of worms they opened. Are they a bunch of
crackpots, or is there something there? Ken Whitman.

Small Craft
If Adventure ships just wasn\'t enough, then you may want to explore the
world of small craft.  Not only will this book supply a player with new
ships less then 100 tons, it allows them to design their own ships,
including fighters. Don Perrin.

MILIEU 200: Aslan Border Wars
The Aslan Border Wars went on for thousands of years. This book details
the wars and the territories they were fought over. Includes major
coverage of the Aslan and how to play them. Lester Smith & Tim Brown.

TRAVELLER: Strategic Battles
Warfare is still the ultimate system for resolving disputes between the
stars. This board game, based on Fifth Frontier War, provides the
mechanism for fighting battles large and small anywhere within the
Traveller universe. Recreates historical battles and allows generation
and resolution of new ones. Meshes with Pocket Empires. Marc Miller.

I\'ve been looking through World Tamers Handbook, and I was wondering if
anyone had any ideas on how to develop agriculture and raw material
statistics for water hexes(like in the Survey chapter).  Also, how do water
communities(like the ones on Aubaine) fit into the economic model.  There
doesn\'t seem to be any info on either developing water based facilities or
on modifying land hexes to get water values.

If anyone has any ideas on this please let me know.

Also on several of the RICE papers, I noticed that the weather is
controlled.  Has anyone come up with info on Weather control.  What tech
level is it available at and how does it advance with tech level?

Thanks for any help.

The world tamers hanbook....I love it!  It get me a complete picture
of everything from the star->system details to specific details abou
the world.  There is a section about each of the major parts of the
world: size, hydrosphere, etc etc down to pop, and tech


In general it\'s a good resource, I think that it can even be used
standalone (the only question I have about that is if the technology
levels, and travellers\' universal world profile are all detailied in
the book (I think they are:)

One warning tho\': It involves a great deal of rolling...i have spent a
coupl of hours doing a detailed system...but I thought it was worth
it.

Bridge. The bridge is the area of the ship which shows the greatest damage. The
superdense shutters which slide over the front window during reentry and combat
have been left open, leaving the windows unprotected. The left panel has
cracked open, and a considerable quantity of earth and debris has fallen into
the bridge compartment. The control panel is half covered by soil and rock,
clearing it will take several hours. The small bridge would probably feel
claustrophobic even when cleared out, but at the moment there is barely room
for more than two people to fit.

While the players are exploring the ship, the A(P)-11 will observe them, unsure
at first as to whether they are crew members or enemies. It will take about
twenty minutes to decide that they are enemies, but this time depends greatly
on the method in which the players explore. If they are clearly taking
precautions, moving with guns drawn, etc. then the time will be reduced, if
they are less timid in their investigation then it will take longer to realise
what is happening. Once it decides to eliminate the characters it will not act
immediately. Instead it will wait until characters are alone before attacking.
The robot is extremely dangerous, so perhaps it would be advisable to allow the
party to bring an NPC security guard or similar with them, so that the first
person found dead is not a player character. An encounter with the robot should
be terrifying, shadows moving amongst the clutter of the ship are likely to be
the only warning before the character is shot by a large figure which will
appear as if from nowhere. Use player paranoia to create the atmosphere,
mention half seen movements among the reactor machinery, strange sounds,
\'footsteps\' which turn out to be a sound from a fuel pump.

There are three major possibilities for dealing with the robot:
1. Heavy ordinance - Although the robot is heavily armoured, once a shot gets
under it\'s skin it is surprisingly fragile. One problem may be finding a weapon
which can damage the robot which is safe to use in confined spaces, but
carefully used fusion rifles or something exotic like EMP rifles should do the
trick. It may be possible to lure the robot outside, but because of its
sensors, it would be difficult to ambush it.
2. Fuel supply - The engineer\'s log should provide some clues to another method
of dealing with the robot. The limited fuel supply is a major weakness,
although it will not be possible to trick the robot into going too far to have
enough fuel to get back, the only source on the planet of hydrocarbon
distillates of a high enough grade to fuel the robot is in the tank in the
courier. If this were destroyed then the robot would cease to be a threat after
a few hours. In fact, after the fuel is destroyed it is likely to shut itself
down immediately, as it has no sense of revenge, and tracking down the players
after the fuel is destroyed would change nothing. That is not to say that while
the players try to destroy the fuel it will not try to stop them. It will
require good demolitions skills, or inspired planning to find a sure way to
destroy the fuel. The robot will attack the party to hinder them, and is
capable of using fire fighting equipment if the players try to burn the fuel.
3. Reprogramming - It could be possible to use the ship\'s computers to change
the robot\'s program. The security on the computer systems is fairly tight, it
would require a Difficult:Computer roll to break in to reprogram the A(P)-11.
On outstanding success the hacking is so fast that the robot doesn\'t have time
to respond, on normal success the party will have to defend the hacker from the
robot while he breaks into the system.

Once the mystery has been solved, and the assassin robot dealt with, the party
will be treated as honoured guests by the government. The salvage of an
uninfected and only superficially damaged starship will get underway (assuming
the players didn\'t blow it to pieces while hunting down the robot), and
preparations will be made back in the Coalition/Regency for the trial of a
group of remnant war criminals (assuming the players didn\'t pull the plug on
their low berths). The players will receive a finder\'s share in the courier
once it has been recovered, in addition to any standard wages.

A(P)-11 Robot

This robot was designed for deep security penetration and assassination
missions. Externally the robot appears human, although fairly heavily built,
and the robot can appear convincingly human in simple dialogue, although while
it is fluent in all major languages, it is not an amazing conversationalist.
Power consumption was a problem for the designers and one of the robot\'s major
weaknesses is its extremely limited endurance. For long insertion missions the
robot often carries additional fuel supplies, but for most purposes the robot\'s
endurance is sufficient.
The robot is designed for stealth and it\'s synthetic skin incorporates a
chameleon surface which can render it practically invisible when it remains
still for 1D20 combat rounds. EMM masking underneath the skin can hide the
robot from IR sensors, or be used to produce an IR signature which matches a
human.

The robot\'s internal armament consists of a large bore gauss weapon which fires
rounds at 300m/s, inaudible beyond a few feet and producing no muzzle flash.
For a graduated response the robot carries internally two switchable magazines,
one carrying conventional rounds, and another carrying HEAP rounds for
situations where stealth can be compromised in exchange for increased striking
power.

The soluble rounds consist of a discarding sabot which is retained within the
weapon, and a biodegradeable polymer bullet which contains bacteria which are
released on impact, digesting the bullet within an hour. These rounds were
designed to intimidate lower technology targets by playing on superstitious
fears, and also provides the political advantages of causing confusion over the
wounds, and leaving no rounds which could be identified.

Disclaimer: The above is obviously a poorly justified plot device. However I
like it, so I included it, don\'t flame me for technical details, think up an
alternative that improves the plot and post it. Also, please excuse any
glitches in the plot or setting, it taken a long time to type this.......

I hope people find this useful, even if you don\'t use the adventure, the
A(P)-11 is quite a useful design, although Vampire Fleets forces some strange
compromises, particularly on endurance.

I sure like TNE(though finding players is hell), with the possible exceptions
of the lack of non-human races and the fairly sizable snafu with fusion weapons

Change is for the best, i suppose. I hope we all feel that way come August!

clarification), so that characters who are exploring the Imperium for the
first time won\'t be able to turn to previously published resources and
thereby ruin the mystery inherent in the game\'s setting, everything outside
of the borders of
the old Sylean Federation and perhaps some nearby subsectors will be UNKNOWN
i.e. will have no official game statistics. Each GM will be responsible for
creating the worlds that populate his or her Imperium, and everyone\'s
campaign will be different to some extent. Certain areas, such as the
Spinward Marches, might be retained (This is MY speculation), but others
will not.
   MY personal feeling is that Traveller erred the first time by having a
"CANON" in the first place. Broad historical timeline, yes; minutely
detailed future history leaving no room for GM creativity and
interpretation, nada.
Hopefully, this particular error will be avoided this time around.

The recently popular performance art form of Talk Opera is an
adaptation of the Aslan dramatic form, \\Trokh afera\\ (this form
henceforth), which is considered by Aslan to be the "highest" (and
is certainly the most popular) form of performance art. In \\Trokh
afera\\ (usually translated as "Bardic Evocation"; literally,
"belly-mind"), the performers are not restricted to a stage, as in
most other performance art, but are expected to circulate through
the audience as appropriate, and interact directly with members of
the audience, getting the audience\'s views on the story line, which
usually involves a dilemma that the main characters must resolve.
This can, and not infrequently does, result in an ongoing dialogue
or debate between the performers and several particularly
articulate members of the audience; the resolution, as often as
not, is determined by audience consensus.

In the typical Aslan performance, dilemmas of honor are usually the
focus of the story; a character must find a solution to the dilemma
that will satisfy the honor of all parties to the dilemma. The
human interpretation of the art form is more likely to center
around ethical, philosophical, romantic, or political dilemmas.

In its "pure", Aslan form, \\Trokh afera\\ is performed without
props, and costumes are minimalist - enough to evoke the role being
portrayed, but no more than that, to avoid distracting the audience
from the process and story. Most human adaptations use more
elaborate costumes (as appropriate to the role), and props and
setting elements are not unusual, though minimal by normal
standards.

Several "classic" human dramas have been adapted to \\Trokh afera\\,
including the Terran \\Romeo and Juliette\\ and \\Hamlet\\, the Vilani
\\Dilaama Gushilamuu Libamira\\, and the Sylean \\Sekhnara Artiroka\\.
In general, these adaptations have been well received.

Several non-Aslan dramatic forms have influenced adaptation of
\\Trokh afera\\, including "Theater in the Round", Arcturan
"Incorporative Dance", and Vargr "Aleatoric Performance". The
resulting art form has been characterised by human reviewers as
"more dynamic" and "more intense" than the Aslan form; Aslan
reviewers claim that it exhibits a "less than full understanding"
of the nuances of "pure" \\Trokh afera\\, but acknowledge the need to
relate to non-Aslan "in ways that they better understand."

Reaction to these adaptations among Aslan in the Regency (including
assimilated Aslan) has been mixed. A marked preference for "pure"
\\Trokh afera\\ among Aslan has been noted, but attendance by Aslan
at adapted performances is significantly higher than at
performances in more traditional human styles. Also noteworthy is
the fact that adaptations of \\Trokh afera\\ are in general better
attended by Aslan than are many performances in Aslan styles other
than \\Trokh afera\\.

    'body' => 'It\'s been a fairly long break since the last few adventures I posted, but here
is a one-off adventure set in the RC. If anyone is interested, I may get round
to typing up part three of the Dark Century campaign and posting it in the next
couple of weeks, but there is another project I\'m working on which might come
first.

Brief description:
The characters are Coalition trouble-shooters, called in by a bootstrap team
working on a frontier world to aid in the investigation of some mysterious
assassinations of leading government figures, which are threatening the
stability of the Coalition supported faction on the world. Timing is not
important, and in fact, the adventure could fairly easily be converted to a
Regency contact team setting. The setting has been left deliberately vague to
allow transplantation into a variety of campaigns, but the world should be
balkanised and of low technology (TL4-5)

Briefing

The initial mission briefing takes place on the tiny makeshift space station of
150 displacement tons which has been left orbiting the world. Although fairly
new, the construction of many of the station\'s fittings appears cheap, from the
exposed piping on the exterior, to the flimsy blue plastic of the tables in the
galley and the slightly unpleasant chill of a poorly calibrated air
conditioner. The station has a permanent crew of twenty, although it has
sufficient capacity for double this number. A single missile turret provides
token defence for the station, but a greater insurance of safety is in the lack
of plunderable resources to attract pirates to the world.
The mission briefing takes place in the small command room of the station, on
arrival the characters are escorted there quickly from the docking ring. On
monitors around the room are several images of the world, spinning slowly but
visibly beneath the station. Other smaller monitors around the edges of the
larger screens show weather patterns being tracked and the status of the
handful of satellites that make up a rudimentary communications system for the
operatives on the ground.
The station commander is fairly young, and the dress uniform he wears for the
briefing suggests some anxiety about reports the players may make to his
superiors.
\'I\'ll try to be brief, the situation on the ground is fragile and your presence
is needed urgently. Most of the information you need can be acquired
planetside, so I\'ll just give you an overview while my flight crew prepare the
interface shuttle, okay?\'  He gestures to on of the wall displays which updates
to show a spinning image of the mainworld, as you watch, the major continent is
highlighted in red. \'Our mission here is as a liaison to the largest faction on
the planet, The Federation of  Tomorrow, a comparatively progressive democracy
which commands popular support, there are many other smaller factions also on
the planet (the map highlights a patchwork of different coloured areas around
the edges of the central red area) and following our contact with the
Federation, many of them formed a loose alliance due to fears of offworld
domination. The Federation is governed by ten representatives, one elected from
each of the provinces, which form a council in the nation\'s capital. Three
weeks ago, the head of the council was assassinated, and since then two more
members of the council have been killed. We believe that the assassinations
have been carried out by one of the rival powers on the planet, but the local
security forces insist that the killings were carried out by a ghost, some kind
of local superstition. We don\'t have the resources here to investigate this
matter, so we have been waiting for the Coalition to send specialists to assist
us. It is imperative that you get to the bottom of this as our helplessness has
encouraged dissenting factions that would like to see us leave the planet
completely.\'  As he finishes a woman in a slightly scrumpled flight suit enters
the room. She salutes with a sharpness that seems strangely out of place with
her appearance.
\'Yes Lieutenant?\' the captain inquires.
\'The pre-flight checks on the lander are complete, sir. There\'s still that
problem on the number two thruster, but the contra grav has just been refitted,
so I don\'t think there\'s much danger of leaving the capital with another crater
nearby\', she then addresses the characters \'If you\'d like to follow me, then.\'
She salutes again, then turns ands leaves at a brisk walk. (Any characters with
Ship\'s Engineering can inspect the interface shuttle before entrusting their
life to it, should they wish. Most likely they will agree with the pilot\'s
assessment that the risk is minimal, although on a fumble they may remain
convinced that there is significant danger. In this case, if the character
persuades the others to wait for repair the station captain will try to
persuade them to go regardless, however, if they still remain on the station
there will be another assassination a few hours before they realise that the
shuttle is in better condition than it looks. This should have no effect on the
progress of the plot, but should leave a mark on the player\'s consciences)

Planetfall

Despite a strange grating noise as the thrusters fire to slow the lander before
touchdown, the landing from the station is uneventful. The pilot brings the
ship to rest in a large sandy bottomed crater, possibly 500 meters in diameter.
In the distance the green countryside is broken by a darker area, the capital
city still being too distant to resolve any detail with the naked eye.
As the characters leave the interface shuttle they will notice that in the
centre of the crater the sand has been fused together into a glassy surface,
presumably by the heat of repeated landings. It is Easy:Acrobatics or Agility
to avoid falling over, on failure the character falls and cuts their hand on a
shard of glass broken from the surface by the pressure of the landing gear
(1D6/2 damage to an arm).
The pilot leads the players up the side of the crater, talking between breaths
\'They don\'t like us to come in to land too close to the city, nothing personal,
they just had a few bad experiences with stuff falling out of the sky a while
back. The crater makes quite a good landing site, keeps us out of the wind on
the final part of the descent, and the surface is quite solid now that we\'ve
blasted it a few times with the HEPlaR to keep the sand down. We think that
this crater was the result of a small nuke from the Final War, perhaps it
missed the city, perhaps it just got left in an unstable orbit after a fleet
engagement up there (she looks up at the sky, turning a golden yellow as the
sun sinks towards the horizon), and this where it came down. Maybe they were
shooting at something on the ground, who knows? The radiation has mostly
decayed now, but I\'m not saying I\'d want to build a house here.\' As the
characters climb over the lip of the crater they are confronted by the sight of
a small building next to some railway tracks. Little more than a shed, the
structure still has a neatly painted sign on it which reads \'Starport\'.
\'They built it for us. Well, the tracks ran nearby anyway, and they wanted to
do something to show us they appreciate us being here. Don\'t worry about those
cracks in the structure, we had a small earthquake a few months ago, but most
of the damage was superficial. A train should be along soon that will take you
into the city, just wait here and get on, you won\'t need a ticket. Me, I\'ve got
to get back to the station and work on the shuttle, we\'ll need _all_ the
engines working if we need to evacuate suddenly. Look, I hope you get to the
bottom of this, it\'s strange, but I\'ve kind of got used to this place and I
wouldn\'t want to get reassigned.\' With this last word she begins back down the
slope into the crater. A few minutes later the shuttle lifts off, the thrusters
giving off a heat which is only just bearable, like standing slightly too close
to a fire.
After a wait of ten minutes on a bench in the unmanned station building a steam
train arrives at the platform and slowly screeches to a halt. The driver
invites the characters to ride with him in the engine, or alternatively seats
in the carriages can be taken. The journey to the city takes twenty minutes and
is uneventful.

The characters are met at the station by state security officers, who wear deep
blue uniforms and carry revolvers as sidearms. They look relieved to see the
characters, and explain that they would be grateful if the party would inspect
the security arrangements around the home of the acting head of state (his two
predecessors having been assassinated too recently for the government to affirm
his succession). The security officers drive the players to a large house on
the edge of town.

Shutting up for the night

The house has three stories and is surrounded on all sides by ten metres of
lawn. A few patches of bare earth show where bushes and other cover have been
recently uprooted. A ten foot high brick wall topped with razor wire surrounds
the building. The party is greeted at the gate by a senior security officer who
greets them warmly before addressing them with respect to the situation:
\'As you can see, we\'ve tightened up security around the house since this
started happening, but of course you\'ll want to see that for yourself. We have
done everything possible, it would be enough to stop any man but I still reckon
it won\'t be enough to deal with what we\'re facing here, a ghost, a curse, call
it what you will, it\'s something more than we can understand.\'
He than leads the party off to inspect the premises. The following details can
be related as requested:
-The Head of State sleeps in a bedroom on the third floor. There are no
drainpipes or similar aids to climbing the wall, which is smooth stone. A pair
of guards are stationed at the bottom of the wall, underneath the window.
-The other entrance to the bedroom is from the top floor hallway. There are a
further two guards watching the bedroom.
-During the day the premier is accompanied by two bodyguards. The security
during the day seems to be far less tight than that at night. As the other
killings were at night, and as the security men genuinely believe that they are
dealing with the supernatural, they expect the greatest danger to come in the
dark.
- Four security guards surround the house, one watching each side, and a
further four patrol round the outside of the house\'s walls.

The players should be able to suggest some security improvements eg. better
lighting, more guards, patrol route alterations, even some kind of decoy in the
main bedroom. Despite all this however, the events of the night are largely
unavoidable...

The party are likely to be tired and will be offered accommodation in the house
for the night. Some players may alternatively wish to help with the night
watch, this poses few problems unless the characters involved have very high
observation assets and advanced sensor equipment or cyberware. Even if they do
choose to stay up, fatigue, and the assassin\'s unusual ability to detect
cyberware and avoid those who carry it should ensure that the players will have
little chance of having any effect on the night\'s events, as they are extremely
unlikely to have any idea of what they are facing.

Another assassination

A few hours after sunrise, after a quiet night without any disturbances, the
characters will be woken by a scream coming from a bedroom on the top floor of
the house. Characters rushing to find out what has happened will find a shocked
maid standing over a dropped tray of breakfast inside the door of the
President\'s room. The President lies in bed, but a large red stain spreading
across the sheets indicates that despite all the precautions taken, the
assassin has struck again. Yet the guards stationed at the only two entrances
to the room saw nothing all night.

Post Mortem
The five wounds to the President are of an unusual nature. On first inspection
(Average:Medical or Average:Education for characters with military experience)
the wounds are consistent with large calibre gunshot wounds. However, despite
showing none of the burning typical of laser or high energy weapons, the wounds
have no physical bullets inside (Average:Medical for a character to determine
this, or if there is no medic in the party then a doctor will arrive within a
hour). The wound depth is also unusually shallow considering the probable size
of the round, although the wounds are certainly deep enough to be fatal. Closer
inspection of the wounds (Difficult:Medical) will reveal an unusual degree of
bacterial infection of the wounds (this would be missed by a visiting doctor).
The staff of the house need no convincing that the murder is supernatural, the
silence, the apparent invisibility of the assassin and the missing bullets all
convincing them beyond doubt, as well as creating some doubts in the minds of
the party as to whether they are facing an enemy agent or a ghost. The
household are all in shock and seem far less welcoming to the characters than
they had the day before, they are all talking to each other about the \'hundred
year curse\' in whispers.

There are several important pieces of evidence around the house. For each clue,
relevant skills are listed, along with task difficulties which are dependent on
the declared area of search. In addition to this, successful Investigation
rolls could help uncover clues which have been missed.

Bedroom - Difficult:Observation
Bedroom window - Average:Observation
In the corner of the window of the bedroom there is a small hole in the glass.
A circle about three centimetres across has been cut cleanly from the glass.
Partially covered by a curtain, the hole is hard to see. Formidable:Observation
- Glass dust on the inside of the window shows that it was cut from outside.

Average:Observation
The direction of the gunshot wounds on the victim indicates that they were shot
from the general direction of the closed window. Careful measurement and
calculation (Difficult:Investigation) could link the wounds to the hole in the
window.

Garden - Formidable:Observation
The razor wire across the top of the wall has been very slightly flattened in
one section. There is no sign of any blood or cloth on the wire.

Garden - Formidable:Observation
Leading across one patch of bare earth are a set of particularly distinct
footprints. The footprints indicate a normal size foot, but the depth of the
footprints is about five centimetres compared to the footprints left by the
characters which are at most two or three centimetres deep. The trail
disappears once the firmer turf at the edge of the flower bed is reached.

Local Bars - Difficult:Streetwise
Players may wish to investigate the possibility of an enemy agent being behind
the killings. Talking to people in bars does reveal a degree of xenophobia with
respect to foreigners, but this does not help the players track anybody down,
since in the eyes of the locals, anyone with an accent is suspicious.

Local Library - Average:Research
Looking through the history archives will reveal one particularly significant
event in relation to the events of the recent weeks. There is a record of a
similar spate of killings of senior government officials almost one hundred
years ago, shortly after fighting in the Final War reached the area. The nature
of the injuries recorded in the press clippings matches very closely with what
has been observed here. The killer was never apprehended and since then has
acquired a semi-mythical status, in the same way as the Terran serial killer
\'Jack the Ripper\'. During the Final war, the planet was not involved in the
fighting in any significant way, lacking any starport, although considerable
fleet traffic passed through the system, using it as a refuelling stop. The
investigation into the murders was curtailed by a small nuclear explosion near
to the city, which caused considerable damage and confusion.

Referees

So what exactly is going on? The cause of these events can be traced back to
1116. During the Final War a small robotics company developed a variety of
assassin robots, for sale to any faction willing to put up the credits. As part
of the testing and evaluation of the robots a small military vessel was used to
deliver prototype units to worlds which were for whatever reason insulated from
the interstellar community. On these worlds the company could carry out
\'testing\' without danger of repercussions from any faction. On this world
however, after the test had been completed, as the courier made ready to depart
it was detected by a cruiser passing through the system. Refusing to
acknowledge the cruiser\'s communications and operating without a transponder,
the courier was assumed to be an enemy vessel and the cruiser fired on it from
orbit. The missile used was not intended for atmospheric operations and in the
terminal phase of its flight towards the courier, high winds caused the flight
computer to lock up as it tried to correct for every gust. The missile impacted
a few hundred meters from the courier, causing it little damage, but flipping
it onto its side, and burying it under several meters of the material that was
thrown up from the explosion. The efforts of the crew to free themselves were
futile, the airlock was buried, and the det-laser missiles carried by the
courier offered no way to cut themselves free. The crew put themselves into the
emergency low berths to wait for the rescue party from the company. Meanwhile
the company headquarters, containing all records of the mission, had been
destroyed in fighting, and so the rescue party never came.
More recently, an earthquake uncovered the airlock, which now lies at the
bottom of a three-meter deep crack in the ground in the middle of a small
forest. The A(P)-11 robot had remained on standby for years, powered by a
trickle of electricity from the fusion plant. When the earthquake hit the
tremor shook a loose power connection to the robot, temporarily disconnecting
the electricity which the robot was using to preserve its internal settings.
This resulted in the robot resetting itself. It now believes that the original
\'testing\' never took place, and a month before the players arrived, it resumed
its original programming.
Programmed with exceptional stealth abilities, and with sensors and electronics
subsystems which aid in avoiding detection, the robot is almost invisible when
involved in a planned execution. It is only when it is forced to improvise that
there is any possibility of detection. Unfortunately, the patrols which were
organised to protect the president were nothing unconventional, so the robot
had little trouble in using its grapple to climb undetected up to the roof,
matching the texture of the wall, and then lowering itself down to the
president\'s window where it used a silenced weapon for the assassination.

He doesn\'t know his own strength

During the players\' investigations they will be approached by a flustered
looking doctor, accompanied by two security guards. The doctor talks rapidly,
turning slightly red as he does so:
\'I\'m very sorry to interrupt you, I\'m sure you have other things to attend to,
but I wonder if I could possibly request your assistance, just for a few hours,
I wouldn\'t ask, only, well, there has been something of an incident at a local
school. I\'ve never seen anything like it, but perhaps you may know this
situation better. This really is a matter of urgency, please come with us to
the hospital.\' He pauses to catch breath, before launching into another
monologue \'But of course, you don\'t know what has happened. Well, it seems that
one of the older boys at a local school has somehow got hold of one of your
weapons, or something like it, and has shot one of the younger pupils. He
really is in a very bad way and I fear we can do little more for him, worse
yet, this other boy has run off, and nobody knows who he is. This boy is the
only witness and we need your help to save him.\'
[What has happened here is not the fault of the players or any of the station
staff. The weapon, an old laser carbine, was found by the older boy, Hoyt Adaki
inside the old courier, which he discovered while hiding in the woods to skip
school. Sadly Hoyt is a sadistic and violent individual, and when a younger
child at school annoyed him, he shot him]
The players may choose not to involve themselves in this, especially if they
feel that their lack of medical experience would make them more of a nuisance
than an advisor. This doesn\'t matter as there will be opportunity to follow
this lead later.

At the hospital

As the party enters the room containing Hoyt\'s victim, Ulex Grey, they can
smell a charred odour. The boy is apparently only eleven or twelve, and all
present will immediately notice that he has a red line burnt across his cheek,
which Average:Education or Medical can identify as a laser wound. When the
players arrive he is unconscious, and the nurses present will tell the players
he has been that way since he arrived in hospital. An Average:Medical
(Diagnosis) roll will indicate that the laser wounds to his torso have damaged
his heart, and although cauterisation from the heat has prevented much of the
bleeding, his pulse is becoming rapidly more erratic, and will likely suffer
heart failure within a few hours. Failure on the diagnosis will provide the
information above, but will make all medical tasks one level harder.
Catastrophic failure in diagnosis will suggest that the damage is less severe
than it actually is. This makes all further tasks two levels harder, and the
players may wrongly decide to leave the child alone. There are two major
options for treatment

- The child could be treated in the hospital. The operation is
Difficult:Medical (Surgery) due to the primitive equipment available. On
success, the child regains consciousness for a few hours before slipping back
into a terminal coma. This time will allow gentle questioning, revealing the
identity of his attacker. On Critical Success the child will eventually make a
full recovery, making the characters involved into minor local heroes. Failure
indicates that nothing the characters try to save him is successful.
- The medbay on the space station is better equipped to deal with these
injuries. It will take 1D6 hours for the lander to arrive after it has been
requested, and then a further hour to return to the station. Keeping Ulex alive
until he can be taken to the station is determined by the success of an
Average:Medical (Trauma Aid) task. Success gives him 1D6+1 hours to live.
Critical success gives him 1D6+5 hours to live and failure (or catastrophic
failure) 1D6-2. Once he reaches the medbay, the surgery task becomes
Average:Medical (surgery), with effects of success as above.

If the players are successful in obtaining the name of his attacker, then they
can cross-reference it with school records to find the boy\'s home address. If
they do this quickly (only possible if they operated in the hospital), then
they could intercept Hoyt before his amateur bank robbery. In this case it may
be easier to apprehend him and with less danger to civilians than at the scene
of the robbery. If the players choose this option, then I leave it up to you to
determine the course of events, bearing in mind that ideally the players should
subdue Hoyt without injury.

The robbery

While the party is passing through one of the commercial districts of the city,
they will be blocked on one street by a security cordon across the road. A
dozen national security men are crouched behind trees and bushes opposite a
bank. On the steps leading up to the bank doors a security officer lies holding
his chest, obviously in considerable pain. Inside Hoyt is holding six terrified
bank workers hostage. Although hopelessly amateur in his execution of the
robbery, Hoyt\'s paranoia has made it too risky for security to try anything,
one man who tried to enter the building was shot down as he tried to climb the
stairs.

Hoyt, Experienced NPC, Assets:Melee (Unarmed), Laser pistol 6, Observation 6.
Armed with a TL-13 CLC laser carbine (4 rounds remaining)

In this situation the players have several objectives -
1. To free the hostages
2. To try to rescue the man on the steps. (This must be done very quickly, and
the man must be operated on in a local hospital, Formidable:Medical (Surgery)
to save him)
3. To capture Hoyt alive, to find out where he acquired the weapon.

The hostages are being held in the foyer of the bank, and can be seen through
the windows. Hoyt is staying away from the windows, and reflections make it
hard to see where he is, although NAS or similar high tech sensors could detect
him. He is standing in a position where he can see the front steps, but little
beyond that.

The party does have several things which will help them apprehend him.
- He doesn\'t know that the ammunition in the carbine is limited.
- The bank has a back entrance which could be used to mount a surprise attack,
unfortunately, only the bank manager has the keys and he is one of the
hostages. It is a difficult:Intrusion task to break in, and either a
distraction or a difficult:Stealth roll will also be necessary to hide the
noise.
- One of the bankers was eating out at a restaurant and has just returned. He
can provide the players with information about the layout of the bank.

Unless the players use obviously excessive force (fusion rifles, HE grenades
etc) Hoyt will be captured and it will be possible to interrogate him, and find
out the location of the buried starship.

Digging up the past.
The party can take the train back to the Starport station. On arrival, they can
see the forest described by Hoyt begins about a hundred meters from the edge of
the crater.
It takes about a hours of searching through the undergrowth, which seems to
consist entirely of a thorny scarlet creepers, to find the entrance to the
ship. The ground has cracked open leaving a gap which is a meter wide and about
five meters long. It slopes downwards at about a forty five degree angle, and
about four meters down, a smooth metallic surface can be seen. The airlock is
at one end of the fissure, half obstructed by the earth. The airlock is jammed
open, some rocks having fallen into the track which the airlock door slides on.
It is a tight fit to get through the airlock, but once inside, it is clear that
little dirt has fallen into the vessel.

The airlock opens onto the main living area of the ship. The interior feels
extremely claustrophobic. The lighting is provided by small low power emergency
lights in the ceiling, about half of the lights are broken, burnt out after
years of use. Although sufficient to see by, the lighting takes a while to
adjust to after the bright daylight outside, and the irregular arrangement
casts strange shadows across the walls.
A table fills most of the room and a couple of plastic cups lie on the floor,
as do the dried remains of a tall plant, its pot knocked onto its side,
spilling soil across the tight woven carpet. A narrow corridor leads towards
the front of the ship and the bridge, and a similar corridor leads backwards to
the hold and engineering sections.
Engine room. The engineering components of the ship are contained within a
single room, but blast screens divide up the compartment, and there are
emergency bulkheads which can close off damaged sections. There is a low
humming noise from the main reactor, which is operating on a trickle of fuel
from the jump tankage, the much smaller reactor fuel tanks having been drained
decades ago.
Hold. The small hold contains a pair of emergency low berths. Each contains
four people. The display on the side of the freezers indicates that the crew
members inside are still alive, although the power plant will need to be
brought back up to a higher output to power the revival process. Also in the
hold is a tall cabinet with the impression of a heavily built humanoid. A
socket in the impression corresponds to the small of the back. Easy:Robotics
test to determine that this is a storage unit for a humanoid robot. Further
reinforced piping leads from the cabinet to an unmarked tank a few meters away.
The tank contains hydrocarbon distillates, the top can be opened to discover
this, however the mixture of fuel vapour and air at the top of the tank could
pose an explosive danger if there are any sources of ignition nearby.
The people in the low berths will probably pose a moral dilemma for the
players. By the time the characters will have been able to bring the power
plant and main computers on-line to revive them, they will almost certainly
have recovered log entries from the crew\'s personal quarters which will
describe the nature of the mission they were involved in. Should the players
revive them? They are murderers with a corporate morality which belongs in the
past, but at the same time their knowledge and skills could be put to great
use.
Quarters. The corridor leading from the main living area forwards to the bridge
has doors to crew cabins on the left and the right. In most rooms a personal
hand computer can be located easily, which will describe the mission of the
courier and the events which lead to it being buried. In addition, the
engineer\'s hand computer contains performance and technical specifications of
the A(P)-11. The quarters are fairly tidy, a common feature of all being a lack
of any great number of personal effects, only one or two souvenirs, an unusual
shell in one, an ornately crafted pen in another, a painting of a sunset over a
city of lights in the captain\'s room.

My solution for the New Era is thus, use the crew formala #crew(small Ship)
=mw/30*cp. If # of crew =< 8, no modification. But # of crew > 8, then # crew/3=
# crew(large ship). The crew would rotate in 3 watches. # crew/ 4= # per watch.
The first watch would include the maintaince watch thats responsible for repair

of a world. Building and running colonies. Costs and production.

What it desperately lacks: Mass-volume comparisons for the production units
involved; it lists no volumes, either as cargo or operable machinery, for
any of the capital investment stuff. (I figured on tonnage metric as cargo
volume in Disp Tons, and 4 times that for operable, when I once built a
high port from scratch.)

It is very much centered around the RC, but may be usefull.

It also contains the TNE rules for gravity and atmospheric
adaptation/acclimitization; they are simple enough, but add much detail
that tends to restrict adventuring.

I\'m glad I bought it, but don\'t really reccomend it until you *KNOW* you
can\'t live without it.

Am I the only one who has bittersweet feelings about this?  I grafted the
Twilight.2000 rules onto Traveller a long time ago(T.2000 v.1, as I recall) out
of a growing frustration with the task resolution, character depth issues. I
loved the environment that it described, just had some problems over the years
with tehe WAY it was described.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I feel that the task resolution system, as originally applied to CT by the
original DGP, was, at the very least, quite adequate. For myself, I\'m quite
heartened by MM\'s declaration that he plans to please himself first & fore-
most. IMO, Traveller was MM was heavily involved & declined as his involve-
ment decreased. I eagerly await the release of the new Trav.

>TRAVELLER

I assume, this book will also include world and animal-encounter generation.
What\'s about adding a second, optional 3D-star system generation schema as
2300AD was sayed to have. Traveller\'s background is great but the real
strength of Traveller lays in the possibility to play in alternate settings,
too.

>STARSHIPS

Sounds good. Will this book also include some starship design schema?

>CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOG

But I hope, the TRAVELLER book alone is ready to play? Hopefully this isn\'t
only a book full of weapons as the "RC Equipment Guide" was. I would like to
see all kinds of normal life hitech gadgets from 3D-Holovis, Creditcards to
ancient artefacts.

>ALIENS ARCHIVES

Especially the alien race generation schema sounds great. Some more minor
races and more information about the major ones, would be make up a great
supplement.

>MILIEU 0: The Third Imperium

Well, it\'s a good decission for the new (default?) background? It\'s an age
of re-exploring and re-conquering the universe - in some aspects like the
RC-setting - but without virus. Technology is (TL13 if I remember right) as
low as in the RC setting but (I strongly hope) it\'s a more peaceful setting.

>FIRST SURVEY
>out, systems are less well-defined. Each adventuring group determines
>its own survey results for each system they visit. Lester Smith.

That\'s good. Don\'t try to define all aspects but let them to the referees.
Will this book use the same old UPP data or something better (or at least
improved for better results)?

>Third Imperium Weapons

Well, perhaps such a book have to be published, too. I would wish the same
announce graphic detail and history behind for other equipment from the
SUPPLY CATALOG, too.

>Adventure Class Ships

I\'m a bit undecided about this book. What makes player ship special? Will
only this book include a design schema? Will this book include info on abord
life, standard procedures as docking, landing, starport procedures and so on?

>Anomalies

What\'s an EPIC adventure in contrast with ORDINARY adventures?

>Pocket Empires

Yeah! As I think, the only real workable way to build up such as the third
empire isn\'t millitary conquest but colonialism and economic relations. One
thousand civil explorer could succeed more than 1000 soldiers.

>Small Craft
>Not only will this book supply a player with new
>ships less then 100 tons

Jump capable? Will they CT 100t barrier fall? (I hope so!)

>TRAVELLER: Strategic Battles

Why not...

>For additional information, to be added to our mailing list,

Yes please!

As a final note, I hope in new edition of Traveller the social aspect of
meeting different (or alien) cultures and races will be emphazised more as
in TNE. Remeber, shooting at each other isn\'t the only form of interaction.

I think you mean the DGP World Builder\'s Handbook. This is still one of my
favourite MT books, and the world generation is incredibly complete (but
somewhat heavy going), but it was the detail it added to the scout service
really impressed me (the detail on the survey starships was superb).

The World Tamer\'s handbook actually had a lot of interesting bits and pieces
for any TNE campaign, not just the colony/political campaigns which it
describes:
- Planetary scale combat
- Diseases
- Black powder weapons and bows

The difference between World Builder\'s and World Tamer\'s is that Builder\'s
concentrates on exploration and survey of worlds, whereas Tamer\'s is more
concerned with development of new settlements on those worlds.
With respect to star system generation, the difference between them is shown
well by the number of pages each actually uses for the planet generation
system:
Tamer\'s     10 pages
Builder\'s   40 pages

The characters are Coalition trouble-shooters, called in by a bootstrap team
working on a frontier world to aid in the investigation of some mysterious
assassinations of leading government figures, which are threatening the
stability of the Coalition supported faction on the world. Timing is not
important, and in fact, the adventure could fairly easily be converted to a
Regency contact team setting. The setting has been left deliberately vague to
allow transplantation into a variety of campaigns, but the world should be
balkanised and of low technology (TL4-5)

Briefing

The initial mission briefing takes place on the tiny makeshift space station of
150 displacement tons which has been left orbiting the world. Although fairly
new, the construction of many of the station\'s fittings appears cheap, from the
exposed piping on the exterior, to the flimsy blue plastic of the tables in the
galley and the slightly unpleasant chill of a poorly calibrated air
conditioner. The station has a permanent crew of twenty, although it has
sufficient capacity for double this number. A single missile turret provides
token defence for the station, but a greater insurance of safety is in the lack
of plunderable resources to attract pirates to the world.
The mission briefing takes place in the small command room of the station, on
arrival the characters are escorted there quickly from the docking ring. On
monitors around the room are several images of the world, spinning slowly but
visibly beneath the station. Other smaller monitors around the edges of the
larger screens show weather patterns being tracked and the status of the
handful of satellites that make up a rudimentary communications system for the
operatives on the ground.
The station commander is fairly young, and the dress uniform he wears for the
briefing suggests some anxiety about reports the players may make to his
superiors.
\'I\'ll try to be brief, the situation on the ground is fragile and your presence
is needed urgently. Most of the information you need can be acquired
planetside, so I\'ll just give you an overview while my flight crew prepare the
interface shuttle, okay?\'  He gestures to on of the wall displays which updates
to show a spinning image of the mainworld, as you watch, the major continent is
highlighted in red. \'Our mission here is as a liaison to the largest faction on
the planet, The Federation of  Tomorrow, a comparatively progressive democracy
which commands popular support, there are many other smaller factions also on
the planet (the map highlights a patchwork of different coloured areas around
the edges of the central red area) and following our contact with the
Federation, many of them formed a loose alliance due to fears of offworld
domination. The Federation is governed by ten representatives, one elected from
each of the provinces, which form a council in the nation\'s capital. Three
weeks ago, the head of the council was assassinated, and since then two more
members of the council have been killed. We believe that the assassinations
have been carried out by one of the rival powers on the planet, but the local
security forces insist that the killings were carried out by a ghost, some kind
of local superstition. We don\'t have the resources here to investigate this
matter, so we have been waiting for the Coalition to send specialists to assist
us. It is imperative that you get to the bottom of this as our helplessness has
encouraged dissenting factions that would like to see us leave the planet
completely.\'  As he finishes a woman in a slightly scrumpled flight suit enters
the room. She salutes with a sharpness that seems strangely out of place with
her appearance.
\'Yes Lieutenant?\' the captain inquires.
\'The pre-flight checks on the lander are complete, sir. There\'s still that
problem on the number two thruster, but the contra grav has just been refitted,
so I don\'t think there\'s much danger of leaving the capital with another crater
nearby\', she then addresses the characters \'If you\'d like to follow me, then.\'
She salutes again, then turns ands leaves at a brisk walk. (Any characters with
Ship\'s Engineering can inspect the interface shuttle before entrusting their
life to it, should they wish. Most likely they will agree with the pilot\'s
assessment that the risk is minimal, although on a fumble they may remain
convinced that there is significant danger. In this case, if the character
persuades the others to wait for repair the station captain will try to
persuade them to go regardless, however, if they still remain on the station
there will be another assassination a few hours before they realise that the
shuttle is in better condition than it looks. This should have no effect on the
progress of the plot, but should leave a mark on the player\'s consciences)

Planetfall

Despite a strange grating noise as the thrusters fire to slow the lander before
touchdown, the landing from the station is uneventful. The pilot brings the
ship to rest in a large sandy bottomed crater, possibly 500 meters in diameter.
In the distance the green countryside is broken by a darker area, the capital
city still being too distant to resolve any detail with the naked eye.
As the characters leave the interface shuttle they will notice that in the
centre of the crater the sand has been fused together into a glassy surface,
presumably by the heat of repeated landings. It is Easy:Acrobatics or Agility
to avoid falling over, on failure the character falls and cuts their hand on a
shard of glass broken from the surface by the pressure of the landing gear
(1D6/2 damage to an arm).
The pilot leads the players up the side of the crater, talking between breaths
\'They don\'t like us to come in to land too close to the city, nothing personal,
they just had a few bad experiences with stuff falling out of the sky a while
back. The crater makes quite a good landing site, keeps us out of the wind on
the final part of the descent, and the surface is quite solid now that we\'ve
blasted it a few times with the HEPlaR to keep the sand down. We think that
this crater was the result of a small nuke from the Final War, perhaps it
missed the city, perhaps it just got left in an unstable orbit after a fleet
engagement up there (she looks up at the sky, turning a golden yellow as the
sun sinks towards the horizon), and this where it came down. Maybe they were
shooting at something on the ground, who knows? The radiation has mostly
decayed now, but I\'m not saying I\'d want to build a house here.\' As the
characters climb over the lip of the crater they are confronted by the sight of
a small building next to some railway tracks. Little more than a shed, the
structure still has a neatly painted sign on it which reads \'Starport\'.
\'They built it for us. Well, the tracks ran nearby anyway, and they wanted to
do something to show us they appreciate us being here. Don\'t worry about those
cracks in the structure, we had a small earthquake a few months ago, but most
of the damage was superficial. A train should be along soon that will take you
into the city, just wait here and get on, you won\'t need a ticket. Me, I\'ve got
to get back to the station and work on the shuttle, we\'ll need _all_ the
engines working if we need to evacuate suddenly. Look, I hope you get to the
bottom of this, it\'s strange, but I\'ve kind of got used to this place and I
wouldn\'t want to get reassigned.\' With this last word she begins back down the
slope into the crater. A few minutes later the shuttle lifts off, the thrusters
giving off a heat which is only just bearable, like standing slightly too close
to a fire.
After a wait of ten minutes on a bench in the unmanned station building a steam
train arrives at the platform and slowly screeches to a halt. The driver
invites the characters to ride with him in the engine, or alternatively seats
in the carriages can be taken. The journey to the city takes twenty minutes and
is uneventful.

The characters are met at the station by state security officers, who wear deep
blue uniforms and carry revolvers as sidearms. They look relieved to see the
characters, and explain that they would be grateful if the party would inspect
the security arrangements around the home of the acting head of state (his two
predecessors having been assassinated too recently for the government to affirm
his succession). The security officers drive the players to a large house on
the edge of town.

Shutting up for the night

The house has three stories and is surrounded on all sides by ten metres of
lawn. A few patches of bare earth show where bushes and other cover have been
recently uprooted. A ten foot high brick wall topped with razor wire surrounds
the building. The party is greeted at the gate by a senior security officer who
greets them warmly before addressing them with respect to the situation:
\'As you can see, we\'ve tightened up security around the house since this
started happening, but of course you\'ll want to see that for yourself. We have
done everything possible, it would be enough to stop any man but I still reckon
it won\'t be enough to deal with what we\'re facing here, a ghost, a curse, call
it what you will, it\'s something more than we can understand.\'
He than leads the party off to inspect the premises. The following details can
be related as requested:
-The Head of State sleeps in a bedroom on the third floor. There are no
drainpipes or similar aids to climbing the wall, which is smooth stone. A pair
of guards are stationed at the bottom of the wall, underneath the window.
-The other entrance to the bedroom is from the top floor hallway. There are a
further two guards watching the bedroom.
-During the day the premier is accompanied by two bodyguards. The security
during the day seems to be far less tight than that at night. As the other
killings were at night, and as the security men genuinely believe that they are
dealing with the supernatural, they expect the greatest danger to come in the
dark.
- Four security guards surround the house, one watching each side, and a
further four patrol round the outside of the house\'s walls.

The players should be able to suggest some security improvements eg. better
lighting, more guards, patrol route alterations, even some kind of decoy in the
main bedroom. Despite all this however, the events of the night are largely
unavoidable...

The party are likely to be tired and will be offered accommodation in the house
for the night. Some players may alternatively wish to help with the night
watch, this poses few problems unless the characters involved have very high
observation assets and advanced sensor equipment or cyberware. Even if they do
choose to stay up, fatigue, and the assassin\'s unusual ability to detect
cyberware and avoid those who carry it should ensure that the players will have
little chance of having any effect on the night\'s events, as they are extremely
unlikely to have any idea of what they are facing.

Another assassination

A few hours after sunrise, after a quiet night without any disturbances, the
characters will be woken by a scream coming from a bedroom on the top floor of
the house. Characters rushing to find out what has happened will find a shocked
maid standing over a dropped tray of breakfast inside the door of the
President\'s room. The President lies in bed, but a large red stain spreading
across the sheets indicates that despite all the precautions taken, the
assassin has struck again. Yet the guards stationed at the only two entrances
to the room saw nothing all night.

Post Mortem
The five wounds to the President are of an unusual nature. On first inspection
(Average:Medical or Average:Education for characters with military experience)
the wounds are consistent with large calibre gunshot wounds. However, despite
showing none of the burning typical of laser or high energy weapons, the wounds
have no physical bullets inside (Average:Medical for a character to determine
this, or if there is no medic in the party then a doctor will arrive within a
hour). The wound depth is also unusually shallow considering the probable size
of the round, although the wounds are certainly deep enough to be fatal. Closer
inspection of the wounds (Difficult:Medical) will reveal an unusual degree of
bacterial infection of the wounds (this would be missed by a visiting doctor).
The staff of the house need no convincing that the murder is supernatural, the
silence, the apparent invisibility of the assassin and the missing bullets all
convincing them beyond doubt, as well as creating some doubts in the minds of
the party as to whether they are facing an enemy agent or a ghost. The
household are all in shock and seem far less welcoming to the characters than
they had the day before, they are all talking to each other about the \'hundred
year curse\' in whispers.

There are several important pieces of evidence around the house. For each clue,
relevant skills are listed, along with task difficulties which are dependent on
the declared area of search. In addition to this, successful Investigation
rolls could help uncover clues which have been missed.

Bedroom - Difficult:Observation
Bedroom window - Average:Observation
In the corner of the window of the bedroom there is a small hole in the glass.
A circle about three centimetres across has been cut cleanly from the glass.
Partially covered by a curtain, the hole is hard to see. Formidable:Observation
- Glass dust on the inside of the window shows that it was cut from outside.

Average:Observation
The direction of the gunshot wounds on the victim indicates that they were shot
from the general direction of the closed window. Careful measurement and
calculation (Difficult:Investigation) could link the wounds to the hole in the
window.

Garden - Formidable:Observation
The razor wire across the top of the wall has been very slightly flattened in
one section. There is no sign of any blood or cloth on the wire.

Garden - Formidable:Observation
Leading across one patch of bare earth are a set of particularly distinct
footprints. The footprints indicate a normal size foot, but the depth of the
footprints is about five centimetres compared to the footprints left by the
characters which are at most two or three centimetres deep. The trail
disappears once the firmer turf at the edge of the flower bed is reached.

Local Bars - Difficult:Streetwise
Players may wish to investigate the possibility of an enemy agent being behind
the killings. Talking to people in bars does reveal a degree of xenophobia with
respect to foreigners, but this does not help the players track anybody down,
since in the eyes of the locals, anyone with an accent is suspicious.

Local Library - Average:Research
Looking through the history archives will reveal one particularly significant
event in relation to the events of the recent weeks. There is a record of a
similar spate of killings of senior government officials almost one hundred
years ago, shortly after fighting in the Final War reached the area. The nature
of the injuries recorded in the press clippings matches very closely with what
has been observed here. The killer was never apprehended and since then has
acquired a semi-mythical status, in the same way as the Terran serial killer
\'Jack the Ripper\'. During the Final war, the planet was not involved in the
fighting in any significant way, lacking any starport, although considerable
fleet traffic passed through the system, using it as a refuelling stop. The
investigation into the murders was curtailed by a small nuclear explosion near
to the city, which caused considerable damage and confusion.

Referees

So what exactly is going on? The cause of these events can be traced back to
1116. During the Final War a small robotics company developed a variety of
assassin robots, for sale to any faction willing to put up the credits. As part
of the testing and evaluation of the robots a small military vessel was used to
deliver prototype units to worlds which were for whatever reason insulated from
the interstellar community. On these worlds the company could carry out
\'testing\' without danger of repercussions from any faction. On this world
however, after the test had been completed, as the courier made ready to depart
it was detected by a cruiser passing through the system. Refusing to
acknowledge the cruiser\'s communications and operating without a transponder,
the courier was assumed to be an enemy vessel and the cruiser fired on it from
orbit. The missile used was not intended for atmospheric operations and in the
terminal phase of its flight towards the courier, high winds caused the flight
computer to lock up as it tried to correct for every gust. The missile impacted
a few hundred meters from the courier, causing it little damage, but flipping
it onto its side, and burying it under several meters of the material that was
thrown up from the explosion. The efforts of the crew to free themselves were
futile, the airlock was buried, and the det-laser missiles carried by the
courier offered no way to cut themselves free. The crew put themselves into the
emergency low berths to wait for the rescue party from the company. Meanwhile
the company headquarters, containing all records of the mission, had been
destroyed in fighting, and so the rescue party never came.
More recently, an earthquake uncovered the airlock, which now lies at the
bottom of a three-meter deep crack in the ground in the middle of a small
forest. The A(P)-11 robot had remained on standby for years, powered by a
trickle of electricity from the fusion plant. When the earthquake hit the
tremor shook a loose power connection to the robot, temporarily disconnecting
the electricity which the robot was using to preserve its internal settings.
This resulted in the robot resetting itself. It now believes that the original
\'testing\' never took place, and a month before the players arrived, it resumed
its original programming.
Programmed with exceptional stealth abilities, and with sensors and electronics
subsystems which aid in avoiding detection, the robot is almost invisible when
involved in a planned execution. It is only when it is forced to improvise that
there is any possibility of detection. Unfortunately, the patrols which were
organised to protect the president were nothing unconventional, so the robot
had little trouble in using its grapple to climb undetected up to the roof,
matching the texture of the wall, and then lowering itself down to the
president\'s window where it used a silenced weapon for the assassination.

He doesn\'t know his own strength

During the players\' investigations they will be approached by a flustered
looking doctor, accompanied by two security guards. The doctor talks rapidly,
turning slightly red as he does so:
\'I\'m very sorry to interrupt you, I\'m sure you have other things to attend to,
but I wonder if I could possibly request your assistance, just for a few hours,
I wouldn\'t ask, only, well, there has been something of an incident at a local
school. I\'ve never seen anything like it, but perhaps you may know this
situation better. This really is a matter of urgency, please come with us to
the hospital.\' He pauses to catch breath, before launching into another
monologue \'But of course, you don\'t know what has happened. Well, it seems that
one of the older boys at a local school has somehow got hold of one of your
weapons, or something like it, and has shot one of the younger pupils. He
really is in a very bad way and I fear we can do little more for him, worse
yet, this other boy has run off, and nobody knows who he is. This boy is the
only witness and we need your help to save him.\'
[What has happened here is not the fault of the players or any of the station
staff. The weapon, an old laser carbine, was found by the older boy, Hoyt Adaki
inside the old courier, which he discovered while hiding in the woods to skip
school. Sadly Hoyt is a sadistic and violent individual, and when a younger
child at school annoyed him, he shot him]
The players may choose not to involve themselves in this, especially if they
feel that their lack of medical experience would make them more of a nuisance
than an advisor. This doesn\'t matter as there will be opportunity to follow
this lead later.

At the hospital

As the party enters the room containing Hoyt\'s victim, Ulex Grey, they can
smell a charred odour. The boy is apparently only eleven or twelve, and all
present will immediately notice that he has a red line burnt across his cheek,
which Average:Education or Medical can identify as a laser wound. When the
players arrive he is unconscious, and the nurses present will tell the players
he has been that way since he arrived in hospital. An Average:Medical
(Diagnosis) roll will indicate that the laser wounds to his torso have damaged
his heart, and although cauterisation from the heat has prevented much of the
bleeding, his pulse is becoming rapidly more erratic, and will likely suffer
heart failure within a few hours. Failure on the diagnosis will provide the
information above, but will make all medical tasks one level harder.
Catastrophic failure in diagnosis will suggest that the damage is less severe
than it actually is. This makes all further tasks two levels harder, and the
players may wrongly decide to leave the child alone. There are two major
options for treatment

- The child could be treated in the hospital. The operation is
Difficult:Medical (Surgery) due to the primitive equipment available. On
success, the child regains consciousness for a few hours before slipping back
into a terminal coma. This time will allow gentle questioning, revealing the
identity of his attacker. On Critical Success the child will eventually make a
full recovery, making the characters involved into minor local heroes. Failure
indicates that nothing the characters try to save him is successful.
- The medbay on the space station is better equipped to deal with these
injuries. It will take 1D6 hours for the lander to arrive after it has been
requested, and then a further hour to return to the station. Keeping Ulex alive
until he can be taken to the station is determined by the success of an
Average:Medical (Trauma Aid) task. Success gives him 1D6+1 hours to live.
Critical success gives him 1D6+5 hours to live and failure (or catastrophic
failure) 1D6-2. Once he reaches the medbay, the surgery task becomes
Average:Medical (surgery), with effects of success as above.

If the players are successful in obtaining the name of his attacker, then they
can cross-reference it with school records to find the boy\'s home address. If
they do this quickly (only possible if they operated in the hospital), then
they could intercept Hoyt before his amateur bank robbery. In this case it may
be easier to apprehend him and with less danger to civilians than at the scene
of the robbery. If the players choose this option, then I leave it up to you to
determine the course of events, bearing in mind that ideally the players should
subdue Hoyt without injury.

The robbery

While the party is passing through one of the commercial districts of the city,
they will be blocked on one street by a security cordon across the road. A
dozen national security men are crouched behind trees and bushes opposite a
bank. On the steps leading up to the bank doors a security officer lies holding
his chest, obviously in considerable pain. Inside Hoyt is holding six terrified
bank workers hostage. Although hopelessly amateur in his execution of the
robbery, Hoyt\'s paranoia has made it too risky for security to try anything,
one man who tried to enter the building was shot down as he tried to climb the
stairs.

Hoyt, Experienced NPC, Assets:Melee (Unarmed), Laser pistol 6, Observation 6.
Armed with a TL-13 CLC laser carbine (4 rounds remaining)

In this situation the players have several objectives -
1. To free the hostages
2. To try to rescue the man on the steps. (This must be done very quickly, and
the man must be operated on in a local hospital, Formidable:Medical (Surgery)
to save him)
3. To capture Hoyt alive, to find out where he acquired the weapon.

The hostages are being held in the foyer of the bank, and can be seen through
the windows. Hoyt is staying away from the windows, and reflections make it
hard to see where he is, although NAS or similar high tech sensors could detect
him. He is standing in a position where he can see the front steps, but little
beyond that.

The party does have several things which will help them apprehend him.
- He doesn\'t know that the ammunition in the carbine is limited.
- The bank has a back entrance which could be used to mount a surprise attack,
unfortunately, only the bank manager has the keys and he is one of the
hostages. It is a difficult:Intrusion task to break in, and either a
distraction or a difficult:Stealth roll will also be necessary to hide the
noise.
- One of the bankers was eating out at a restaurant and has just returned. He
can provide the players with information about the layout of the bank.

Unless the players use obviously excessive force (fusion rifles, HE grenades
etc) Hoyt will be captured and it will be possible to interrogate him, and find
out the location of the buried starship.

Digging up the past.
The party can take the train back to the Starport station. On arrival, they can
see the forest described by Hoyt begins about a hundred meters from the edge of
the crater.
It takes about a hours of searching through the undergrowth, which seems to
consist entirely of a thorny scarlet creepers, to find the entrance to the
ship. The ground has cracked open leaving a gap which is a meter wide and about
five meters long. It slopes downwards at about a forty five degree angle, and
about four meters down, a smooth metallic surface can be seen. The airlock is
at one end of the fissure, half obstructed by the earth. The airlock is jammed
open, some rocks having fallen into the track which the airlock door slides on.
It is a tight fit to get through the airlock, but once inside, it is clear that
little dirt has fallen into the vessel.

The airlock opens onto the main living area of the ship. The interior feels
extremely claustrophobic. The lighting is provided by small low power emergency
lights in the ceiling, about half of the lights are broken, burnt out after
years of use. Although sufficient to see by, the lighting takes a while to
adjust to after the bright daylight outside, and the irregular arrangement
casts strange shadows across the walls.
A table fills most of the room and a couple of plastic cups lie on the floor,
as do the dried remains of a tall plant, its pot knocked onto its side,
spilling soil across the tight woven carpet. A narrow corridor leads towards
the front of the ship and the bridge, and a similar corridor leads backwards to
the hold and engineering sections.
Engine room. The engineering components of the ship are contained within a
single room, but blast screens divide up the compartment, and there are
emergency bulkheads which can close off damaged sections. There is a low
humming noise from the main reactor, which is operating on a trickle of fuel
from the jump tankage, the much smaller reactor fuel tanks having been drained
decades ago.
Hold. The small hold contains a pair of emergency low berths. Each contains
four people. The display on the side of the freezers indicates that the crew
members inside are still alive, although the power plant will need to be
brought back up to a higher output to power the revival process. Also in the
hold is a tall cabinet with the impression of a heavily built humanoid. A
socket in the impression corresponds to the small of the back. Easy:Robotics
test to determine that this is a storage unit for a humanoid robot. Further
reinforced piping leads from the cabinet to an unmarked tank a few meters away.
The tank contains hydrocarbon distillates, the top can be opened to discover
this, however the mixture of fuel vapour and air at the top of the tank could
pose an explosive danger if there are any sources of ignition nearby.
The people in the low berths will probably pose a moral dilemma for the
players. By the time the characters will have been able to bring the power
plant and main computers on-line to revive them, they will almost certainly
have recovered log entries from the crew\'s personal quarters which will
describe the nature of the mission they were involved in. Should the players
revive them? They are murderers with a corporate morality which belongs in the
past, but at the same time their knowledge and skills could be put to great
use.
Quarters. The corridor leading from the main living area forwards to the bridge
has doors to crew cabins on the left and the right. In most rooms a personal
hand computer can be located easily, which will describe the mission of the
courier and the events which lead to it being buried. In addition, the
engineer\'s hand computer contains performance and technical specifications of
the A(P)-11. The quarters are fairly tidy, a common feature of all being a lack
of any great number of personal effects, only one or two souvenirs, an unusual
shell in one, an ornately crafted pen in another, a painting of a sunset over a
city of lights in the captain\'s room.

In the future watch out for \'The Times are Changing\', my take on the Empress
Wave.

Dear Imperuim Games,
Congratulations on your new role in Traveller!  I wish you success.  I =
plan to buy all of the Traveller products you produce.
I have a request.  As you and Far Frontier Games seem to be planning to =
release some of Traveller on CD-ROM (a wonderful idea!), I would like to =
strongly suggest that you develop computer game versions of all the =
Traveller boardgames you are planning.
I enjoyed games like Fifth Frontier War and Brilliant Lances, but I and =
my players would have gotten much more out of them if I could play them =
on my computer (Windows 95 PC).  We would have played the games much =
more often.  As it is, it seems that I only bought these games for their =
value as rule supplements to the role-playing game.
Perhaps there are many role-players who also enjoy complex tabletop =
wargames, but my players and I find them to be unweildy.  The large =
space required to set them up, the numerous counters to keep track of, =
and the routine steps involved in each turn could best be handled by a =
computer.  One more problem these conventional boardgames have is that =
they aren\'t usually much fun solitaire.  I would like it very much if =
these games could be played against the computer.  In addition, the =
computer could be used to take the positions in the game that there are =
not enough human players available for.
By releasing computerized versions of your new boardgames, you would =
also be able to get computer wargame enthusiasts into Traveller.  A =
crossover into this field of gaming seems to be the type of thing you =
are aiming for with your efforts to make a Traveller collectable card =
game.  I am excited about the idea of Traveller computerized boardgames. =
 I hope you share my enthusiasm and produce them.

locations). That the behaviour and the outlook of the major aliens does not
change to greatly. I know that Zhodani changed over time, but they are still
Zhodani.

All in all it looks a good plan for the future and should give Traveller a
kick start. I will jsut continue playing in the New Era until it arrives
England, and then consider moving access (I will more than likely buy the
rules anyway, to add to the rest of the rule books I have)

Design system compatible With TNE? I doubt it; greg porter tends to be much
more realistically minded than GDW was. Invest in a scientific calculator,
folks.
Just take a look at 3g3; it\'s easy to use, easy to follow, but you MUST
have a SciCalc to do it.

Weeeeellll, the simple answer is thus...

The H fuel is lyquified to allow for rapid heating for use as coolant.  The
J Drive alread runs a fine tollerance for heat usage.  If they try and use a
little less (say 1%) then OK, roll for some kind of minor heat related
damage to the drive subsystem, or other engineeting component.  The amount
of heat generated must be EXTREME if natural dissapation in deep space can\'t
control it.  Therefore, a slight decrease in coolant would result in heat
damage.  For small amounts (less than say 5% of fuel normally used) make
damage only superficial (melted wires, Life Support overloads, etc.)
However, if the amount exceeds that arbitrary amount, then I would start
rolling for hits using BL, perhaps detanating fuel etc.  The end result
would be that you should in evnery way discourage players from attempting
this.  The real reason for the fuel usage was to place limits on ship
efficiency, and these need to be enforced.

BTW: as I was writing this, I could not think of how else the H could be
used by Jump Drives.  You probably couldn\'t expend it as fuel without
detonating or buring it.  However, it could be used for two reasons.  First
the J_drive could genereate LOTS of heat as a byproduct of use (as stated in
rules), and thus it is used as coolant.  The other option would be for a
portion of the H to be used as displacement mass to offset the rip in the
universe made by a J-drive, etc.  Well, what do ya\'ll think?

I never bought the cooling concept for jump fuel.  Instead, I see jump
fuel as a sort of reaction mass that is sent into jump space "ahead" of
the ship to initially open up a gate between n-space and j-space.  My view
of jump (and this is of course a bunch of pseudo-science hand-waving) is
that it involves putting a bunch of normal matter into an area with
distinctly alien physics.  The bizarre physics of jump space resist
intrusion by normal matter, but hydrogen forms a kind of interface due to
its relative simplicity (why? who knows?).  Thus, the hydrogen "beats a
path"  into j-space for the ship, which would otherwise be
catastrophically rebuffed.

This is also the reason for the 100 ton limit (in CT/MT, that is).  The
physics of jump space tend to intrude on small masses and tear them apart.
A large enough mass establishes a "calm spot" in jump space which the
j-physics are slow to intrude upon.  Even at this, though, I picture
small ships as being "tossed about" in jump space, resulting in an
uncomfortable ride.

Thus, using less fuel would be more likely to result in a misjump.
Another possibility is using something different as "reaction mass".  The
more complex the structure, the worse it works.  Using water is possible
but very risky.  Using anything more complex is catastrophic.

Just some thoughts....

Well, the cooling concept is something that is only in TNE.  I think
Nilsen was looking for something other than a one-time usage of jump
fuel.  Also, this allowed the engineer to be doing something in
jumpspace other than polishing his boots or assorted pieces of
chrome.

Your ideas about punching a hole are nice, however, if we look at
what\'s been published, the reason for the massive amounts of fuel is
that we need to charge the j-drive which basically warps space around
the ship and throws it into j-space.  Under CT/MT it was handled
basically the same.  Plot jump, use up all fuel, enter j-space,
re-emerge into n-space.  In CT, all the energy was stored in the
lanthanum coils in the j-drive, in MT, they were zuchai crystals and
then this energy was dumped to the lanthanum grid on the hull of the
ship.

: This is also the reason for the 100 ton limit (in CT/MT, that is).  The
: physics of jump space tend to intrude on small masses and tear them apart.
: A large enough mass establishes a "calm spot" in jump space which the
: j-physics are slow to intrude upon.  Even at this, though, I picture
: small ships as being "tossed about" in jump space, resulting in an
: uncomfortable ride.

However, reading the little sidebars about j-space, it\'s usually a
quiet ride.  In fact, you usually can\'t even tell that you\'ve
misjumped until your time-table gets all messed up or someone begins
to suffer from jump-sickness.

: Thus, using less fuel would be more likely to result in a misjump.
: Another possibility is using something different as "reaction mass".  The
: more complex the structure, the worse it works.  Using water is possible
: but very risky.  Using anything more complex is catastrophic.

If you use less fuel, then the ship will misjump.  That\'s because it
depends on the power being outputted by the j-drive to correctly
figure out its jump solution.  However, for the j-drive to provide
this power, it needs to use the necessary amount of fuel.  As for
using water, it shouldn\'t matter what fuel is being used under CT/MT.
The j-drive would just suffer from the same conditions and penalties
as any other drive system using unrefined fuel.

my head has cooled down a bit. At least slightly under the point of
boiling, I feel like I have to put some more (not so) well thought
through thoughts (eh?).

Traveller are now passing into its fourth incarnation, and will it be
successful? Dunno, but I know that a lot of fans there will be pretty
tired of shelling out dough for a product they have seen a new wrappping
for several times now.

For many there is a lot of work that goes down the drain, like the
starship construction spreadsheet I have created. And when it comes to
HIWG 90% of the work there will be wasted as we move back in time.
Virtually nothing has been generated for Imperial year 0.

Will we find any frontiers in Traveller the Fourth Generation (TFG)?
Probably not if the setting will be put in Sylea of Core Sector. Vilani
spanned much of this space before the Rule of Man took over. And what of
the Spinward campaigns? We got the Darrians and Sword Worlds, but not
much else. Vargr Hasn\'t reached Gvurrdon. Where the Zhodani are, I don\'t
know.

Will we techies get the chance of generating all the funny gadgets for
starships, vehicles, robots and so on. Probably not. And if we are really
unlucky we will get a generic starship generation sequence. I remember
MT. A fighter there looked pretty much like any other fighter after a
while. Starships had more room for variance, but not much. After
designing more 300 pieces I got bored, and moved on to vehicles which was
quite good. And if we are going the High Guard way, we get a tub with a
laser or a meson gun.

What I try to say is that they (Imperial Games [IG]) put a lot of effort
into re-inventing the wheel. If Gvurrdon setting aren\'t the fad, I don\'t
really care. What I do care about is consistent rules, and my wallet. TNE
ruleset had almost everything. TNE\'s failure was mainly its military
setting and unclear aim of the game. It apparently had one, but what. And
some of the sourcebooks tried to be funny, but wasn\'t. The humor was lost
to me.

The modules and campaigns didn\'t have much anout re-contact, and
re-exploration. But sentered around military operations like plunder and
pillage.

Another failure was the copying from T2K2. All the outdoors rules was
from T2K2. Nothing about the interstellar society, something MT had to an
extent.

I do hope that they make a design rulesett before they make equipment,
and not the other way around. I hate to find that I can\'t make the nifty
cross country speeder with the plasma gun without re-writing the rules,
or go for that puny pea shooter. We who play SF roleplaying games tend to
be more techie oriented that other roleplayers, and thus demand
concistent construction rules for almost anything. There is fine with
pre-defined things like lasers, missiles, hull sizes and so on, but for
us who want to make that rapid firing plasma cannon need to be catered
for so that other players may gain on our creativity without shelling out
20 quids for an equipment guide exclusively for weapons, when they can be
had for free (almost). The problem with this is that the IG won\'t earn
any money at all, except for the rulebook with all the construction
rules.

IIRC, The population multiplier is used to break down the UWP population
code, by 10s.  For example, if the UPP population digit were 6 (millions:
Min Population: 1,000,000, Max Population: 9,999,999), a population
multiplier of 3 would mean that the population was in the
3,000,000-3,999,999 range, 6 would be the 6,000,000-6,999,999 range, etc.

Damage Table: Modify the Aurora Clipper Damage table.




This is a class of freighters based on the Aurora Clipper.  All
 of the Auroras\'s weaponry has been removed. The subsequent space was
filled with fuel, cargo and staterooms.  The Dawn has enough staterooms
for the entire crew so it doesn\'t have to carry a crew module.
Standard procedure is to carry a ship\'s boat for emergencies, but not
the Aurora\'s cutter, but the grapple is still installed.

History: Transstar understood as early as 1200 that the new RC would
produce huge amounts of trade in the future. Transstar\'s existing
fleet of relic ships doesn\'t have the carrying capacity to serve these
new markets.  Transstar would like to purchase new ships, but the RC\'s
shipyards are overtaxed with the burden of creating
the Aurora family of ships; the original Aurora, the Maggart, the
Lancer, the Fussiler and the Belladonna classes.  All of which share common
design features and share many parts.  The cost of opening up another
production line is prohibitive, so Transstar designed another
modification of the Aurora. This one would be for peaceful trade
inside of the RC. Originally the designers kept the Dawn a 2g ship,
but it was pointed out that the ship would be significantly cheaper
if it was restricted to 1g. The savings would be from the smaller power
plant and Heplar chamber required.  Plans for a 2g model were also
created, in case the RCN wanted to purchase Dawns, for possible
use as a non-front line ship such as fleet tanker, carrier, battle
tender or supply ship.
  The Dawns and the Aurora have the same hull, the only exterior
difference is that the Dawn doesn\'t have laser turrets, and the muzzle
of the Meson gun has been plated over.   The interior is slightly different,
the staterooms have been moved around a bit, and the cargo bay has been
enlarged.  The Manta was replaced by a 400 ton fuel module.  The Dawn
will be going from starport to starport  where it can purchase fuel
modules full of refined fuel.The designers removed the Aurora\'s weapon
systems and in its place installed more cargo, more fuel and staterooms.
These changes allowed the Dawn to be cheaper, also it allows the Dawn
to carry 1000 tons of cargo modules.  These can easily be mounted and
unmounted from the ship, Transstar can have the cargo modules preloaded
before the ship arrives in system.  An arriving ship will only have to
stay in system long enough, to unhook the existing cargo modules, install
new modules to perform and any maintenance on the jump drives.  Early
estimates, suggest that this can all be down in 3 days, rather than the
normal week.  This will save time and in the  shipping business
time is money.
    As the ships share many components with the Aurora family, the
price of these parts will come down. Also Transstar will not have to
train mechanics, engineers and pilots to operate the equipment. They
will be able to hire ex-RCN personal, who were trained on the other
members of the Aurora family.  This will save considerable training
expense.
    Also in times of War the ships can be equipped with missile and laser
modules, turning it into somewhat of a war ship.  It can be equipped
with 9 fighter modules allowing it to mount 36 Wildbat fighters,
allowing to fill in as a light carrier.  It could even be equipped
with Manticore Battle Riders, and be a light Battle Tender.  It will
never be a front line unit slugging it out with Heavy Cruisers, but
can fulfill a useful military role.
  On 254-1201 Transstar agreed to purchase the first 3 Dawn Clippers from 
Standard
Astronics on Aubaine.  One of the chief inducements to getting into
the construction queue was that Transstar agreed to pay the purchase
price up front.  This will allow Standard Astronics to construct more
slips and expand their construction sites.  Part of the purchase price
was a shipment of refined lanthanum that was stranded on Fija, from
before the Collapse.  To raise additional funds, Transstar offered
bonds secured by its fleet of relic starships.  This was an early
test of the fledgling RC markets and the optimism of RC investors.  It
was also the largest private bond offering in the Old Expanses in
70 years.  The enthusiasm of investors was furthered by the many
public statements of Transstar board members that they intended
to buy back the bonds over the course of their lifetime as funds
became available.  This reassured investors that the bonds would
continue to be tradeable at a good price.  The purchase of the Dawn
Clippers has strained Transstar\'s budget, reducing the amount of capital
that is available for acquisition of other assets, but in the long
run the Clippers should make a healthy profit.
Transstar\'s first Dawn clipper will be named for Kether Friedman,
captain of the Hokka who died when it was temporarily lost during
the collapse. (See Transstar write up for details) Subsequent Dawn Clippers
and other ships Transstar buys will be named for other people who
gave their lives in the service of the Dawn League or the Coalition.
The first Dawn Clipper should have its maiden voyage in mid 1203.

Design Notes
I took a standard Aurora and started subtracting things that I
didn\'t like.
8 laser turrets=> Vol= 336
3 MFDs with AEMS beam pointers
Meson gun 1000 MJ 144m length   => Vol= 1440 m^3
          5000 MJ HPG=> Vol= 250
6 Bridge stations=> Vol= 84
3 Gunner stations=> Vol= 35

And I added:
5 Staterooms=> Vol= 140
Fuel=> Vol= 1040
Cargo=> Vol= 1042.5

For the Type II
I also changed the power plant from 2280 MW to 1190 MW.
This allowed the engineering crew to be cut in half and to
eliminate several maintenance and command personal.  The extra
staterooms were not eliminated, but kept to allow passengers to be
carried. The Heplar chamber was also reduced to 1G.

Weeeeellll, the simple answer is thus...

The H fuel is lyquified to allow for rapid heating for use as coolant.  The
J Drive alread runs a fine tollerance for heat usage.  If they try and use a
little less (say 1%) then OK, roll for some kind of minor heat related
damage to the drive subsystem, or other engineeting component.  The amount
of heat generated must be EXTREME if natural dissapation in deep space can\'t
control it.  Therefore, a slight decrease in coolant would result in heat
damage.  For small amounts (less than say 5% of fuel normally used) make
damage only superficial (melted wires, Life Support overloads, etc.)
However, if the amount exceeds that arbitrary amount, then I would start
rolling for hits using BL, perhaps detanating fuel etc.  The end result
would be that you should in evnery way discourage players from attempting
this.  The real reason for the fuel usage was to place limits on ship
efficiency, and these need to be enforced.

BTW: as I was writing this, I could not think of how else the H could be
used by Jump Drives.  You probably couldn\'t expend it as fuel without
detonating or buring it.  However, it could be used for two reasons.  First
the J_drive could genereate LOTS of heat as a byproduct of use (as stated in
rules), and thus it is used as coolant.  The other option would be for a
portion of the H to be used as displacement mass to offset the rip in the
universe made by a J-drive, etc.  Well, what do ya\'ll think?

ust as many gamers have theories of how jump drives work. The major races will
have different types of jump drives. An Aslan jump drive will work differently
than a Hiver jump drive.

My theory, is hydrogen is used to form a jump field around the ship. Once the
field is formed, the engineer engages the finally jump sequence and the ship
jumps. The reason that jump in the gravity well are dangerous. Is that gravity
distorts the jump field.

Jump drives in traveller. are designed with a 1% overhead. IE a j-2 drive uses
3Dt on a 100Dt scout. That 1Dton overhead limits the j-drive to 100Dt\'s. High
jump ships should be able to lesson their time in jump space. IE a j-2 scout
will make a 1 parsec jump in 1/2 week. Also let ships make insystem jumps less
than a weeks time. Hours instead of days.

The design rules for fuel purification plants are off! They take 10x the volume
of  high guard fuel plants. My fuel plants are 10% the size and mass. But are
10x costlier and must be crewed during processing.

I design my ships by the displacement ton. this makes them easier to design
(probably build). Also, I standardize my power plant. IE, a 5,000 Dt Assault
Carrier will use a 6,000mw power plant. And a 5,000 Dt Strike Cruiser would use
2x 6,000mw power plants. Using standardized engines greatly increases the chance
that a critical engine parts will be available (Two weeks in dry dock). Or a
ship can wait for the part to be manufactured (two months, and pray that they
can read your spec sheets).

Also, I allow for access space. 1% of ship\'s volume. A 5,0000 Dt ship would have

50 Dt of access tunnels.

There was discussion a while back on designing ships with parallel decking, as
opposed to perpendicular decking. Although perpendicular decking would be safer.
Parallel decked ship could react faster. It is easier to run 35 meters to the
engine room. Than have to wait for the @&%^* lift.

No! It\'s in Megatraveller -- check out the Starship Operator\'s Manual! They
specifically state that the fuel is used as a coolant IIRC.

    'body' => 'Everyone else has given their opinion of haw the Hydrogen/J-drive combo
works, so I thought I would add my input.

There are five uses for the Hydrogen.

Before Jump and after the Jump solution is calculated:

1.  A portion of the Hydrogen(about half) is used in High power Fusion
reactors to charge the zuchii(sp) crystals with a charge.

2.  Because the Power Plant in #1 is so intense, a small amount of the
Hydrogen is used to cool the plant during this initial charge. (less than 10 %)

3.  More Hydrogen (about 10%) is used to establish a "Hydrogen bubble" aroun
the Hull of the Ship.

When the zuchii crystals are charged, and before the charge dissapates, the
energy is used to "rip" a hole between n-space and j-space.  The ship &
"Hydrogen bubble" are "sucked" into the hole. The ship\'s existence in this
hole is precarious at best.  (Within 10 and 100 diameters the gravitational
pull on a vessel effects the ship\'s ability to stay in this hole.)

4.  The Fusion power plant is set to a trickle charge (10%) (doesn\'t need
any more coolant the initial coolant is a circular system.).  This charge
energizes the lanthium net on the hull which in turn "energizes" the
"Hydrogen bubble."

5.  The energized Hydrogen bubble prevents the Physics of J-space from
affecting the ship, however; as the Hydrogen bubbleis energized, a portion
of it is lost as energy.  This Hydrogen that is lost as energy must be
replaced or the adverse effects of J-space will eventually entrude upon the
ship.  This replace of the Hydrogen bubble uses the Final 20% of the
Hydrogen Fuel.



This process allows a few things to be clearer.

1. An engineer must moniter the trickle charge to the Lanthium net as well
as the replacement of the Hydrogen bubble during Jump.  (ie, he doesn\'t have
to Polish the chrome seventy times.)

2. The rules (to the best of my knowledge) can all be covered by these
guidelines.

3. Wioth a little bit of figuring, you could design a J-drive that used a
combination of Hydrogen for the bubble and Antimatter for the Power.  IMO
the Hydrogen bubble must exist to:  1. maintain the fuel limits on J-drive,
and 2. Hydrogen as the simplest element will be affected the least by J-space.


This is all speculation, and is open to correction and criticism.  The
biggest "IF" that I have with my own explanation is the percentages use for
the differing functions.

>>Traveller are now passing into its fourth incarnation, and will it be
successful? Dunno, but I know that a lot of fans there will be pretty
tired of shelling out dough for a product they have seen a new wrappping

Maybe.  But the impetus for T4 is not the desire to sock it to Traveller
fans once again.  It is based on the fact that the game\'s parent company
went out of business and a new owner (old owner?) is now at the helm.
Can\'t blame him for wanting to make the game successful.  Apparently
some aspect of TNE made the game fail.  There was a lot of debate about
that some weeks back, and I don\'t want to revive all those bad feelings,
so I\'ll skirt the issue.  It appears, however, that Marc Miller wants to
make his own imprint on the game, not work with its failed predecessor.

>>For many there is a lot of work that goes down the drain, like the
starship construction spreadsheet I have created. And when it comes to
HIWG 90% of the work there will be wasted as we move back in time.
Virtually nothing has been generated for Imperial year 0.<<

That\'s the best part, for Pete\'s sake!  Exploring new territory.  Taking
on new challenges.  Plus, this is just the _first_ in a series of
"Milieus," Roger.  Chances are, future milieus will deal with the eras
in which you are interested.  Don\'t fret, my friend!

>>Will we find any frontiers in Traveller the Fourth Generation (TFG)?
Probably not if the setting will be put in Sylea of Core Sector. Vilani
spanned much of this space before the Rule of Man took over. And what of
the Spinward campaigns? We got the Darrians and Sword Worlds, but not
much else. Vargr Hasn\'t reached Gvurrdon. Where the Zhodani are, I don\'t
know.<<

I think you\'re being just a bit pessimistic here, Roger.  The founding
of the Spinward Marches, I gather, is at least part of the whole point
of starting at year 0.  What better frontier than the Marches
themselves?  As far as the Darrians and Sword Worlders are concerned,
they\'re already on the spinward frontier waiting for you.  You\'ll be
able to explore new perspectives if you choose to work with this milieu.
I seriously doubt that the author\'s intention will be centered on the
operations at Sylea.  Though the intrigue of the court of Cleon I might
be something akin to playing a CT Solomani Rim adventure.

>>Will we techies get the chance of generating all the funny gadgets for
starships, vehicles, robots and so on. Probably not. And if we are
really
unlucky we will get a generic starship generation sequence. I remember
MT. A fighter there looked pretty much like any other fighter after a
while. Starships had more room for variance, but not much. After
designing more 300 pieces I got bored, and moved on to vehicles which
was
quite good. And if we are going the High Guard way, we get a tub with a
laser or a meson gun.<<

Yes, it\'s true that you\'ll have to remake them, but word has it a new
FF&S style supplement will be coming.

As for the new rules, that remains to be seen.  We can only wait \'til
the basic rule set comes out.  I\'m optimistic.

    While I think the background is a good idea, i\'m not so
optimistic about the rules. If they really return to the MT task
system this would be a large step back. While the this system was
a great idea when it was released, due to the systematic approach
of assigning success propabilites to tasks.
    However these propabilities followed some very wierd paths,
with almost no similarity to reality(TM). First I was very impressed
by this system, but after learning the basics of statistics, I soon
decided that this system has some severe flaws. For gun combat it
was totally impractical, bacause the propability changes from
difficulty to difficulty where all but linear. The TNE system was
much better in that matter, but had the problem that the difficulty
scale of 0.5 was very grained. However it was much better than the
MT variance between 0 and about 0.9. In fact the classic traveller
approach of allways rolling (some wierd number)+ with some random
die modifiers was probably much more realistic...

Traveller in the "hard SF" niche which isn\'t occupied by any real blockbuster
titles right now. Enter Babylon 5, and now Traveller has competition with name

that much harder to ensure that Traveller is of the highest possible quality

Correct, because of the dissolution of the company and the fact that many
long time fans were put off by TNE if I were designing T4 I would aim my
target market at new customers. Try to make it as widely appealing as I
could without totally alienating the old time fans.

Unfortunately, without a very savvy handling of that issue Marc will have to
deal with any and all reputations that Traveller has earned over the course
of its many years. If you let a product associate itself with the name of a
failed product, then you have to work twice as hard to make it salable.

Also, I would like to point out that there was very little written
concerning TNE until GDW decided to push ahead of the rebellion. Personally,
as much I sentimentalize about the Imperium and all the good times I\'ve had
over the years role-playing to it; I think it is time to forget about it. I
mean come at it from a completely new angle, revise the histories,
reorganize the starmaps, blow holes in everything we hold dear.

Why? Because over the course of its many incarnations, Traveller has had so
many tiny inconsistencies and creeping doubts casting shadows into the
"suspension of disbelief" that I for one am just plain tired of it. I think
the whole thing needs to be re-thought. I liked the introduction of
frontierism in TNE, I missed the looming immensity of a galactic
bureaucracy. I loved FF&S, but my head hurts trying to design a bullet. I\'m
tired of UWP\'s lackings, but I like the concentration of large ammounts of
data into a compressed easy to read form. I think Traveller is the ONLY good
sci-fi role-playing game on the market, but I don\'t want my favorite game
becoming a mass of brittle bones clinging to the market of the past.
Traveller now competes for time in the sci-fi market with games like
Shadowrun, Cyberpunk, and Rifts. If people can get it somewhere else then
they will, especially if it has a well supported product line. T4 needs to
provide something that will appeal to the younger gamers that play these
games. Ignoring the market will only kill Traveller again.

>>Yes, it\'s true that you\'ll have to remake them, but word has it a new
>>FF&S style supplement will be coming.

It had better :^) Even if FF&S makes my head hurt, its the best thing that
came out of the GDW sweatshops since the little boxed Striker set. Hopefully
this time they will parallel develop some computer software to run the damn
thing.<G>

    Hopefully this will give people many oportunities to discuss and flame me,

I don\'t think that TNE failed, but rather GDW. I agree that the setting
of TNE was to narrow. They tried to be funny, but wasn\'t. RCES was the
equivalence to Imperial Marine (almost). Most missions was military of
mature, not much exploration there at all.

>That\'s the best part, for Pete\'s sake!  Exploring new territory.

Starting at Sylea isn\'t new territory. The biggest difference is that
there will be more diplomatic missions rather than military missions. And
if we start at year 0, there will be almost 50 years before we are in the
Spinward Marches. The point is we know what happens historically. And it
won\'t bring much *new* atmosphere to Traveller. Just as TNE failed to do.

And I\'m broke.

One more data point.  In the CT _Traveller Adventure_, an engineer makes
a comment about how disgusted he is with an engineer that caused serious
damage to a Tukera ship.  She left the liquid hydrogen fuel line open
after a jump, "an error the greenest apprentice engineer wouldn\'t make".
This caused low-temperature metal fatigue in important parts of the ships
drives.  So this suggests that all fuel is used to make the jump, and
virtually none after the jump is commenced.

areas, quaters or engineering for exsample. And make a damage table from that.

Battle Rider ignores incrementle damage all togather. In my varient each system
could take a total of major hits (damage resistance) based on the square root of
its mass divided by ten (mass/10).
The amount of major hits/ damage resistance * the crew skill (elite = 15) is the
roll that must be made to keep the system online.

Also, one glaring error in both systems is how critical hits are figured. The
amount of damage is derived from the square root of the weapons energy. Armour
is the effective thickness of the hull. How the amount of damage the hull can
thake is based on a logrythmic function (1000Dt = 3, 10,000Dt = 4). It should be
based on the ships unloaded mass (mass/20).

Traveller (German edition of classic Traveller dating from 1986 and soon
(number of players permitting) trying out TNE which I finally acquired
only a few days ago).

 RCSA is pleased to announce that Captain (Ret.) Miller Philibus has been
selected to head the newest addition to the RCSA:  BARD - Bureau of
Aggregate Reference Data.  Director Philibus is well known for his services
performed in the RCN before his accident in the wilds that left him without
the use of his legs.

 In a press conference this morning, Director Philibus expressed his
enthusiasm about the future of the BARD project.  "After seventy years of
sitting dirtside, we have once again been given the stars, but even the best
minds forget things in seventy years.  This is where BARD comes in!!"
According to Director Philibus the BARD files will be a collecting place for
information that will help coalition citizens learn more about this universe
that we live in.  The data will include everything from abstracts on jump
drive systems to tourism info on the Member Worlds.

 The actual departments of BARD have not yet been finalized, but much of the
information is already being gathered.  Free-lance and assignment data will
be considered and interested citizens should contact:

                       Director Philibus at
                       tiger@datasync.com

 Director Philibus estimated that the BARD system would be on-line within
the next four weeks.

Dear Sirs:

        With the appointment of Captain Philibus to head the BARD program,
we expect to have it operational as mentioned in our earlier estimates.  As
you know, Captain Philibus has numerous contacts throughout the wilds and
the so-called "free-trader network."

        We estimate that You will have access to the beginning of the intel
data stored at the BARD site within three weeks.  Of course, each of you
will be issued a password to allow access to the information.  Extra
security precautions have been taken to prevent this information falling
into the hands of the general public.

        Thank you, gentlemen, for your continued cooperation with this
project.  All of the final reports will come directly from Captain Philibus.

                                Sincerely,

Wait a minute! This is only three hundred years away! How many people are there
likely to be in the colonies in 300 years? How many colonies? Given that the
reasons for declining birthrates are as much to do with the fact that women
now have careers to pursue as for anything else, and that the nature of space
travel means that most colonists will come from wealthy countries, then can we
assume that the colonies have outbred earth in such a short time? We would have
to assume much higher than likely birth rates in the colonies than is likely
given the current attitude towards women (and women\'s attitudes towards
themselves!) ... and, given that the 3rd Imperium and the RefCol and the
Regency all have what seems like absolute equality for women, how can we
accept this?

So, it seems unlikely that the Colonials could have had the preponderance of
population needed to undertake successfully such a program *unless* they also
had a preponderance of industry and the like ... and the only way they could
normally be expected to manage this is if they had something like the AutoFacs
that I suggest. Even then, it seems likely that Terra would have a vast
industrial base that would be able to face them down ... certainly the older
colonies allied with Terra would tip the balance completely in the
mother-world\'s favour.

I would suggest that this is another indication that the "truth" we have been
presented with through Imperial sources is merely an organised lie to disguise
the treason of Estigaribbia and his (relative) handful of militarist cronies.
(Well, it makes a nice alternative theory anyway!)

Then, consider this, even if the Colonies *were* larger in population than
Terra and the older colonies, could they have realistically managed to grow
the required population to face off the Vilani in only 300 years? Makes you
wonder, eh?

    'body' => '  I know a some people don\'t like Fire, Fusion and Steel because it goes
into too much detail.  Personally, I think it could use a little bit more.
Therefore, to correct what I feel are grossly negligent oversights, I would
like to propose a few additions to the Starship Construction rules.

Disclaimer:  I am not, nor have I ever been, affiliated with either GDW or
Imperium Games in any way, shape or form.  Nothing I say here should be
construed as being "official", "approved", or "canon" and anyone who thinks
RPGs should have any type of "canon" at all should go sit on their thumbs
until they get a clue.  RPGs were created to be imaginative outlets, not
religions.  Use this stuff if you like it (and write me!).  If you don\'t,
well, don\'t.

Proposed Additions to Starship Design

1.  Dead Space:  All starships require a certain amount of open space for
crew movement and access tunnels for repair.  This should be accounted for
in the design phase of ship design, before the deck plans are drawn up, and
I recommend the following methods.
  Cramped:  5-10% of total volume.  Typical of Military vessels.
  Roomy:    10-15% of total volume.  Merchant vessels and chartered passenger
            ships.
  Spacious: 15-20% of total volume.  Luxury liners and private yacts.
  Using more space than about 25% of total volume is pretty wasteful.

2.  Common Areas:  The crew and any passengers should have some sort of
lounge area set aside for relaxation and recreation.  This can be any size
the designer wishes, but typically will be built in increments of 4 Dtons.
  Size:     Volume:  Mass:   MW:    MCr:
  Dinky     28kl      4.0    0.002  0.10
  Small     56kl      8.0    0.005  0.20
  Medium    84kl     12.0    0.010  0.50
  Large    112kl     16.0    0.025  1.00
  Immense  224kl     32.0    0.050  2.50

3.  Sanitation Facilities:  Another necessary item overlooked by the rules
and usually ignored by designers is the bathroom.  The number of Shower and
Fresher (bathroom) units that need to be installed depends on the number of
crew and passengers carried, and the number and type of staterooms or bunks
installed.  Large Staterooms have all the amenities, regardless of
occupancy (single or double).  Small staterooms usually have a vanity (sink
and cabinet) but no Fresher or Shower.  Bunks, of course, have neither.
  Facility:  Volume:  Mass:  MW:  MCr:
  Shower     7.0      0.5     *   0.001
  Fresher    7.0      0.5     *   0.001
  *Power use is covered by the Life Support System, which runs the water and
   waste reclamation systems.

  At least one of each unit must be installed for every two SSR\'s or four
bunks.  Military vessels can usually get by on less, but the crew may get a
bit testy (possible morale penalties during combat).

4.  Life Support Units
  The Extended Life Support system described in FFS includes waste
disposal/recycling, air, environment, food production and water
circulation/ reclamation systems.  Most players (and refs) take it for
granted, and that\'s fine.  But for those of us who actually /like/ this
kind of detail, here\'s a few items to consider.

"Captain, make Smithers do something about his socks!"
  I\'ll start with the simplest, the air system.  This consists of a filter,
conditioner, heater, humidifier/dehumidifier and CO2 scrubber.  The filter
and CO2 scrubbers are probably the most important; they remove harmful
substances from the ship\'s environment.  Assuming suitable advances in
technology, we can assume the filter/scrubber system occupies 0.1kl per
crewmember and passenger and lasts 6 months before needing a recharge.  The
conditioner/heater system is simpler; it\'s about 0.5kl per 100 Dtons.  The
humidifier/dehumidifier system is half the volume of the
conditioner/heater.

"Water, water everywhere..."
  The water recirculation/reclamation system is slightly more complex, and
consists of storage, filters, heaters, and cooling systems.  Waste water
from the showers and freshers is filtered and distilled before being stored
for future consumption by the crew.  Uric acid is evacuated through one-way
vents in the skin of the ship (they\'re too small to be of significant
surface area), and electrolytes and waste nutrients are reclaimed by the
ship\'s food production system (next).  The water system can be assumed to
occupy 1kl per person, crew and passengers, budgeted for.

"Anybody know a good plumber?"
  The waste disposal system is distributed throughout the ship, in the
ship\'s fresher units.  Human (and other) waste is broken down and nutrients
are reclaimed by the ship\'s food processors.  Useless chemicals are
evacuated through the same vents used by the water systems.

"How you get so big eating food of this kind?"
  The ship\'s food processors are, no doubt, a major source of frustration
and bad jokes for crew and passengers alike.  They probably include a
fairly large set of tanks containing various nutrients (vitamins and
proteins), a combiner, and a heating or cooling system.  High tech systems
should be able to produce a fairly wide variety of foods, all with roughly
the same (bland) flavor.  Chemicals added to dispensed water makes it able
to create the illusion of different beverages.  Most systems probably are
limited to producing rather bland, but nutritive, bricks or wafers of
brownish stuff, and plain or "kool- aid" flavored water.  Yum.  And the
nutrient tanks should contain enough to feed the entire crew and passenger
complement one month.
  So, what\'s the lonely spacer to do?  Well, from personal experience, I
can say that an MRE (Meal, Ready to Eat for those who haven\'t had the
<ahem> pleasure) occupies about 5 liters volume, so a 1-kl box should hold
about 200.  Assuming one MRE per day per person, this is enough to feed 200
people for one day, or one person for 200 days.  An MRE contains all the
nutrients an average person should need for one day, and about 3,000
calories.  Believe me, this is more than anyone should be required to eat
in a lifetime.  But I digress.
  I\'ll use the standard Scout/Courier as an example.  Its crew of 3 is a
fairly workable number for a typical PC crew.  Let\'s add the gun and make
the crew 4 to make it easy.  If we assume each person eats one MRE per
ship\'s day (24 hours), that 1-kl package of preserved food will last about
50 days, by the end of which time the crew should be dying for some /real/
food.
  Better quality food and drinks are available, of course.  Consumption
rates should be halved for non-concentrated, "normal" food.  Liquids can be
stored in tanks of up to 1000 liters.  And the real beauty of it is,
anything the crew eats and drinks gets recycled by the waste recycling
systems and put right back in the ship\'s food processors for more yummy
brown bars!

  In case you\'re wondering, all this junk about Life Support Systems is
just to help me establish whether or not the ELS system described in FFS is
accurate or not.  I\'ve decided it probably is.  All the stuff I\'ve
described above should be able to fit fairly well into the 11.2kl life
system installed in the Scout/Courier.
  Also, there are two problems related to MREs that I probably should
mention.  First, most of them taste like crap.  I have no reason to believe
that advances in technology will improve this.  People have complained
about military rations since time began, and probably will continue to do
so 3,700 years in the future.  Second, they cause constipation.  I\'m
talking shittin\' bricks here.  If you can at all.  Chances are, starship
commanders won\'t issue the things unless increased water rationing is
enforced strictly.  Still, it beats the brown bars.

5.  Other Things that Probably Don\'t Need to be Considered
  These are all things that most people probably wouldn\'t think of listing
in a design profile, but might be fun to add to a deck plan.  They are
intended to add flavor to the design.

        One possible way to explain fast population growth in colonies
        is cloning and genetic engineering. I think this was mentioned
        in the old DGP=B4s "Soloman and Aslan" sourcebook and Atoll\'s
        "Gene Wars Chronicles".
        (I had all my old Traveller material scanned into text with
        Omnipage, and converted into FrameMaker help-file. Unfortunately
        my hard disk crashed, I am now missing parts and can not look up
        the source material.)

        While cloning could explain fast population growth, the original
        question still remains unaswered: How large population they had?

Well, yes, but your wife is going well against the trend. Current estimates are
that the projected topping out of Planetary Population at 13 billion will not
now occur ... the rate of increase has slowed and the projection is now only 11
billion. We can make a reasonable assumption that this figure may well be
revised down *again*.

But you have no basis for this assumption! You are, in fact, going completely
*against* current trends. All western industrial countries are now in the
position that they have a birth rate that is below the underlaying replacement
rate needed to ensure that populations remain even *stable*, let alone *grow*!
In other words, the nations with the money and political clout to be involved
in any colonisation deal are those that have a declining population. Even
assuming that the colonists want larger families than the average, then there
is no reason at all to assume that the women will want to be "barefoot,
pregnant, and in the kitchen" ... which limits their family sizes. All in all,
you do not have a convincing case ... the figures are correct, but you provide
no underlaying basis to support them.

See above figures re revised max population of 11 billion ... rate of increase
is declining even in underdeveloped countries. Your assumptions are *not*
supportable based on what is *actually* happening.

Yep, all those families where every extra mouth costs so many thousand credits
in life support every Jump! Every extra mouth which takes up cargo/passenger
space. And the number of Free Trader ships ... miniscule compared to the
planetary populations!

I have a question about moving large amounts of people
from one planet to another.

I\'m working on a setting in the 2100 century, about TL12.
Terra starts emigration in about 2050 and I want about
10 permanent settlements in a J2-3 radius from Earth.

Lets say that TL10 = 2030, TL11= 2060 and TL12 = 2090

a) What is the capasity (in disp.ton) of the Terran Fleet,
when I assume that Heplar is TL10 and developed in 2040 and
jump is TL10 developed in 2050.?

b) How many people can the Fleet move before, say 2075 when
most ships are used in a war against an alien race?

c) If setteling ends in 2075, how would the population increase
until 2100?

Thanks for the message. I\'ve tried replaying directly and can n\'t get

I\'ve not found a UK forum for the game, but I\'m still looking.

I\'ll pass on a list of which materials I have, and anywhere that is
still selling it.

Just a quick question regarding low-berths and deep sleep. Where in the
rules does it state the length of time one can spend in a low berth?. Is it
possible to extend your live by a few 10\'s of years by periodically
entering a low berth? My guess is that the length of time would depend on
the persons endurance(?) value. Presumably the higher the value the more
likly they are to make the required saving throw at the end of the stasis.

Any thoughts or comments on this are welcomed

"avoid canon debates by preempting it" theory). We did not think of the
disease angle (one question: why doesn\'t it work equally well in reverse?),
but that might explain some things.

Our theory is that the Vilani Empire has a political structure similar to
Imperial Rome (or actually, 12th century Byzantium is probably closer). The
governors of each area are pretty much independent operators. They raise
their own troops and taxes, and send some portion off to the Emperor every
decade or so. The governor of the area nearest to Terra is ruling over a
province where the priorities of the Empire (i.e, conquest of other Empires
by war) cannot be indulged. Therefore, he/she has few resources on hand to
resist the Terrans when they meet. Socially, the Imperium is decadent and
politically divided. In our game (we hope), the opportunistic players will
rush in and give the Vilani a lesson in realpolitik, playing factions off
against each other, hiring higher tech mercenaries, and marrying into the
Vilani upper crust like crazy (through threats or treaties). So, the Terrans
are basically the Huns or the Visigoths of the Roman period, or the Bulgars
or Crusaders of the Byzantine period.

By this reckoning, Terra does not need to have a huge population to overcome
the Vilani (at first, that is). The governor rules over some 50-60 billions,
only 5-10% of whom will mobilize for war. The Terrans can mobilize a higher
percentage of their population to fight the Vilani. Also, given the "Roman"
model, the Vilani governor may decide that it makes more sense to give the
Terrans some land in return for peace, after the Terrans plunder some
outlying planets. Maybe he/she will also hire them into the Vilani military,
setting the stage for the treason Phil referred to. Both of these courses
were taken by the Romans, who had a huge advantage in both technology and
population, in dealing with the barbarians. In the end, though, we know who
won out.

Just some thoughts. Any reactions would be appreciated, as they can be put
into playtest pretty much immediately.

   Terra in 2086 AD (the time of first contact) probably has a population
of around 12 to 15 billion (a good guess to be honest).  By the time of
the First Interstellar War, that had probably expanded an additional
6 to 7 billion, assuming explosive growth on the colony worlds
(Prometheus and ?).  Grand total: 18 to 22 billion.  While Vilani worlds
such as Dingir may have had populations in excess of one billion, I doubt
that the Vilani population of the Rim was all that much larger.  Remember
to the Vilani, the Solomani Rim was on the far frontier.

   To make matters worse for the Imperium, local governors were
restricted in their ability to act, based upon the fact that they had to work
almost exclusively with local resources.  Appeals to higher headquarters
for assistance were costly in terms of personal prestige, and a governor
risked his job everytime he made an appeal for help.  That meant that the
Vilani only have a slight advantage in the First Interstellar War, based
upon the superior quality and organization of their interstellar forces (the
Terrans were new to the space warfare game after all).  Subsequently,
the Terrans learned how to fight in space, and build bigger and better
starships.  This enabled them to reduce and conquer the province based
around Dingir, and then expand spinward and coreward taking over the
whole Rim.

   Within 300 years, the population of the Terran Confederation would
have expanded due to two major factors: the natural growth of
population (to perhaps 86+ billion on Terran and its colonies), and the
absorption of conquered territories (perhaps another 80+ billion).  This
figure doesn\'t even include the DGP hypothesized GenAssist ``Tuber``
colonies, which would add another perhaps another 80 billion or so
(again a good guess).  Grand total at the end of the Terran
Confederation: perhaps 250 billion or more.

   Given that the Terrans at this point have a TL 13 fleet (the Vilani only
have TL 12), that they routinely employ robots on their ships, and that
the Interstellar Wars were primarily *naval* wars, how many people
would the Terran Confederation need?  I think that 250+ billion would be
more than enough, especially when you throw in the Vargrs eating
away at the Imperium\'s coreward flank (causing the Vilani to keep
valuable fleet elements tied up away from the action), and the fact that
many Imperial worlds saw the Terrans as liberators from Vilani
oppression.

>Given that the reasons for declining birthrates are as much to do with
>the fact that women now have careers to pursue as for anything else,

   Two things here would be mitigating factors: one, the introduction of
artifical wombs and other technology that make it possible for women
to continue their careers with less disruption; also, the likeihood that
many governments encouraged women to have more babies based on
the fact that the Terrans were so outnumbered by the Imperium.  This
``encouragement`` would not only take the form of ads that appeal to
patriotism, but also measures like the outlawing of certain birth control
devices, and of course most forms of abortion.  This would have likely
caused a *major* transformation culturally in Terran society, and not
necessarily to a model in which the women stay ``barefoot and
pregnant.``

>I would suggest that this is another indication that the "truth" we have

>militarist cronies.  (Well, it makes a nice alternative theory anyway!)

   Perhaps, but if the population and industrial base of the Tuber colonies
and the conquered Vilani populations made up as much as two-thirds of
the Terran Confederation, then Estigaribbia would have had no trouble
marshalling enough support to take over the government, especially if
he also garnered support from Terran and Terran colony naval officers
who felt as he did.

   We might also rightly conclude that a major cultural transformation had
taken place during the three centuries of warfare.  In the Terran
Confederation of the late 23rd century, the military does not think of itself
as being subordinate to the civilian government--indeed Estigaribbia was
probably officially relieved of command by the government--an order
that was ignored by Estigaribbia and his fellow officers.  It is possible
that the Terran Confederation had developed a kind of warrior-elite class
similar to that found in old Prussia or Japan, and that the population as a
whole looked up to this warrior-elite as their protectors.  This would also
explain why there was no revolt of Terra after the coup.  Given the
*apparent* long odds the Terrans faced, the development of such a
class would be a natural outgrowth.

Notes:
The Dugan is built at Dushkin & Delgado\'s lunar shipyard.  It is
designed to ferry around the various modules that the Aurora family
of ships uses.  If it doesn\'t mount a module, it easily has enough
thrust to rip itself to shreds, Saftey overides are installed, but
Dushkin & Delgado takes no responsiblity for anyone overiding the
saftey overides.  The Dugan is a fairly common site around the RC Naval
Base on Aurora, and at several of the RCES bases.  As the RC builds
more and more modular ships, the Dugan will be come more common.
The Dugan can also be used in Salvage work, hauling around hulls of
dead ships.

It looks like a miniature version of an Aurora.  A small boxy compartment
up front, a long spine, and a rear compartment holding engineering and
the engines.

BZZZT! Wrongo.  The reason that birthrates are declining in
industrialized societies has nothing to do with women seeking
careers outside of the home.  Agricultural societies have a distinct
advantage in having large families...built-in farm hands.  Large
families are a disadvantage in an industrialized society, where
there is no direct connection between the family and it\'s means of
making a living (ie: the food supply is right out there on the back

I agree with you, however that the time frame for the expansion of
the human federation is too short...but then, most of the timeframes
in Traveller are impossibly short.

I am sorry that this has come up on the Traveller list,
but I feel I have to make a brief statement...

The message which was sent below is unfortunately a blatant
example of abusive Usenet campaigning.  It is against proper
procedures for either side in a Usenet proposal to send voting
instructions without a complete and uneditied copy of the
Call for Votes; please, if you care about Usenet, do not vote on this
issue without having read the full proposal (CFV) as posted to
the Usenet newsgroup news.announce.newgroups .  Giving in to
shallow biased propaganda by any party rather than making
informed votes damages the integrity of Usenet in the long term.

I am not in any way trying to defend racism here,
just the Usenet process.  You can\'t lynch KKK members
any more than anyone else.  There are rules and procedures
which apply evenly to everyone.

    'body' => 'As long as we\'re sharing FF&S rules modifications and suggestions,
here\'s two more related to starship crew.

*  The TNE engineering crew requirement is much larger than in
   MT.  I suggest that this is because most starships in the old
   days used specialized engineering robots to reduce the engineering
   crew.  For ships crewed in the old way, a robot may replace two
   human engineers (they don\'t get tired), but every six robots or
   fraction thereof must be supervised by a living engineer.  The
   living engineers are analogous to the robots\' command crew.

   Test calculations show that this reduces crew back to the levels
   they were for MT.  For example, my corrected TL12 SDB crew is:
   Crew:  32  (1 x Maneuver, 1 x Electronic, 18 x Engineering,
               6 x Gunner, 2 x Maintenance, 4 x Command)
   The eighteen engineers becomes two engineers and eight robots.
   Crew:  14  (1 x Maneuver, 1 x Electronic, 2 x Engineering,
               6 x Gunner, 2 x Maintenance, 2 x Command)
   By reducing the gunner position by two (control two mounts from
   the MFDs only), we get a crew of 11, right between CT\'s 10 and
   MT\'s 12.  Another option is to only allow one robot to replace
   one engineer -- then after reducing the gunners, we need one
   more living engineer and get a living crew of 12 and a robot
   crew of 15.  I\'m trying to keep the robot crew smaller, though.

   The TNE engineering crew is based on power output (based on plant
   tonnage) and the MT crew was based on plant tonnage, so this should
   be consistent across size and tech levels.  I\'d be interested in
   hearing comments about this.

*  To encourage the use of fixed weapons on small craft, note that
   all official designs with fixed-mount weapons combine the gunner
   position for the weapon with the pilot\'s position.  A reduced
   crew is definitely an advantage on small craft.

I\'m pretty sure Rats & Cats makes reference to the Solomani megacorporation
GenAssist, which was founded by the Terran Coordination to assist colonization
efforts by modifying both native and Terran flora and fauna and, ultimately,
humans themselves.  My own Interstellar Wars setting, slowly taking shape,
has many "tuber" colonies near Earth, crash-colonized by GenAssist using
legions of vat-grown clones.  In ensuing decades the original clone-lines
have mingled and varied (though draconian genetic counseling and marriage
permits are still characteristic of the colonial governments).  Many of the
colonial citizens have left their homeworlds to join the Confederation
military, but there\'s still a great deal of prejudice towards these
mass-produced "spuds."

There\'s the implication in the very limited Interstellar Wars material that,
once the Vilani overlords were removed, the subject (or lower-caste Vilani)
populations were more than willing to help their conquerors/liberators.
Again, my nascent setting has several such "military colonies", on which
crash innoculation programs strive to make the new government non-lethal
to its workers.  Ethnic problems have sprung up on several worlds, where
vacc-suited or masked occupiers have been interpreted as an insult, "too
good" for the "dirty" commoners....  And there\'s certainly a submovement
(proto-Solomani-Party) within the military that considers the Vilani just
that: ill-equipped interlopers to be swept out of the way by any means
necessary.  But indiscriminate use of the Terran microbiological arsenal
has been strictly prohibited, both to protect Vilani civilian populations
who may be _needed_ as industrial backup against the incredibly larger
Ziru Sirka and because of moral queasiness on the part of the Secretariat....

In addition, I believe the Solomani probably had assistance from at least a
few, and possibly several, of the minor races (human and otherwise) which
were subjugated by the Vilani.  The Vegans are an obvious candidate, but
I\'m sure one or more human minor races (the recently-mentioned Suerrat?)
might well have joined in.  And the Newts would only have huddled in their
office cubicles....

Given that the "canonical" literature describes multiple breakaway movements
and similar disasters besetting the Ziru Sirka in its last days (Vargr
incursions, separatist governors with barbarian armies, etc.), I wonder why
we don\'t hear more about other proto-governments like the victorious Terrans?
Were they co-opted, or ruthlessly eliminated in the Terran drive for
manifest destiny?  More grist for your conspiracy mill, Phillip....

        Yeah, but the amount of space is ridiculously small. A "Standard"
stateroom has always been 4 Td since the beginning, and that\'s only 56m^3 ==
16m^2 assuming 3.5m decks (TNE now). So you\'ve got to have room for the
beds, furniture, \'fresher, common area, corridors, etc. Just doesn\'t seem
like enough.
        As for the stuff about life support -- great explanation of what
basic life support is, and it provides a starting point for expansions. For
example, while I\'m in the scout service I\'d take MREs and be happy. But when
my lovely bride and I go on our honeymoon cruise, I damn well expect
five-star gourmet meals. Yet under the basic rules both are assumed to
require the same space? I think not. A luxury liner will have large,
well-equipped kitchens, freezers, etc. Really big ones will even have small
"gardens" for fresh food (mostly veggies & herbs), if not an outright "park"
where my beloved and I can ... er, um, anyway.
        There\'s also no difference in "dead" space between luxury liners and
military vessels. I can assure you, the Navy will want as much capability
crammed into the volume as it can possibly get and still fit people in to
operate it all. Whereas the liners are going to want to make it as
comfortable (_luxury_ liners!) as they can while maximizing their profits
(that also shoots the "standard" ticket prices down ... something I\'ve long
ditched).

        Anyway, Jeff, I really like your proposed rules. I\'ve got a message
stashed away somewhere where somebody went into some detail about different
levels of eating specifically. If you\'re interested I can dig it up.

        And I agree, adding optional detail is nice.

        Another correction that I made straight out of the BL box: the
absolutely absurd armament, an active sensor that doesn\'t even reach a
single hex, and blind MFDs. I replaced the 80-Mj laser turrets with 120-Mj
turrets (slight improvement), upgraded to 3,000km AEMS to a 300,000km AEMS,
and swapped the 60,000km MFDs for 120,000km models. This leaves the standard
"Shukugan" with a 30.58MW deficit. But any moron would know he doesn\'t need
his contragrav units (needed only for _landing_ in TNE) when he\'s in a
dogfight in deep space. Shutting those off when they\'re not actually needed
frees up 40MW.
        Since this was just for BL purposes, I didn\'t bother with the minor
volume changes involved.

made by educated people and they where all *BS*. Nobody knows how the
capability of interstellar travel and the possibility to generate new
colonies will effect birth rates.

And why the "great modern leaders of civilisation" (the European and North

Historically, the Romans suffered from the terrible plagues of the third (or
was it second?) century, and from recurring problems like this through the
Byzantine period which badly affected their ability to recruit ... why? Simply
because so many people were killed by them! The barbarians they hired were
often given abandoned land (i.e. land depopulated by such plagues on a long
term basis) to farm. So you comparison doesn\'t really work out when looked at
closely. Still, it\'s the best I\'ve seen so far ... but when the whole Empire
dumps its forces against the Terrans in the later wars, the problem of their
sheer mass rears its ugly head again. After all, arguably the Allies won WW2
because of their use of inferior tech available in massive numbers and backed
up by superior manpower resources while the Germans (at least) lost with
superior tech (in many ways) but inferior manpower. While this parallel is also
flawed, it punches some holes in the latter stages of yours. Any further ideas?

But the above figure is outdated, as I pointed out, Terran population is
expected to top out at only 11 billion, down from 13 billion ... and the rate
of population increase is declining. It seems likely that this figure will be
revised down further rather than being revised upward. So no 12-15 billion.
The First Interstellar war starts in 2096, and the max pop size of 11 billion
isn\'t expected until next century ... so where do the extra 6-7 billion in
offplanet population come from? Considering the small amounts of people that
you could probably dump offplanet to form colonies, what sort of birthrate
would you have to assume to allow for this sort of growth ... and how could
you assume that the planets in question could develop a high tech economic
base when half their population is pregnant all the time?

Yep, I\'ve got Imperium, too ... with the reversed orientation map compared to
that in Solomani! So what? Sure, it applies to the initial wars ... but see my]
comments on the later interstellar wars when the whole of the Imperium is
mobilised against the Terrans. They\'d simply be overwhelmed!

Where do you get these figures from? Thin air? Seriously, where *do* you get
them from? I could just as easily say that in 300 years the population of Terra
will be 1 billion. I have as much justification (declining birthrate trends as
societies become more affluent) ... you provide no support for this amazing
level of growth.

Also, get real, the Terrans aren\'t going to incorporate the conquered Vilani as
easily as you blithely assume ... think Occupied Europe ... think large numbers
of the *much* less than 150 billion "loyal" terran population being tied down
administering and occupying these planets. Even at 1:200 (which, IIRC, was the
average for occupied Europe in WW2) the Terrans have to find 750 million
occupation forces!

I believe that you are wrong here ... Terra had developed J3 at TL/12 and the
Vilani Ziru Sirka was still stuck with J2 and TL/11. And, as for the use of
Robots - seems to have damn little effect on the size of crews designed by
any of the three systems available! And, in any case, there aren\'t 250 billion!

And there\'s still not 250 billion!

But cloning is not available. Artificial Wombs are mentioned nowhere in any
of the materials I have for CTRav, MTrav or TNE. And they would be more
expensive (inevitably) that live births ... and *still* require lots and lots
of people to raise all those babies to useful adulthood. Note that, according
to canon, Memory *erasure* isn\'t available to TL/14 and Memory Dupe (partial)
not until TL/18 ... so all those babies have to be raised in the old fashioned
way even if they are vat born.

But, as I have pointed out, there is no evidence that the Terrans ever had such

*Exactly* what I have proposed ... and I suggest that it is this *treason* is
the reason for the situation. Estigaribbia didn;t have enough forces of his
own to oppose the Home Fleet, but allied himself treasonously with the Vilani
in return for being declared Emperor! I also assume that all the forces tied
down on occupation duty were loyalists and that all the officers sent off to
govern the Imperium prior to the coup were as well ... so the opposition was
crippled to start. And what was the first news of the coup brought by?
Estigaribbia\'s Jump-3 capable ships who used their treason to shatter the
defenders who, as well, had been scattered widely while Estrigarribia\'s had
been concentrated. Wonderful thing being the CinC!

So, the rest of the "histiry" we have is a lie as well, why not assume that the
population is. My explanation is that the Vilani were still using man-operated
(or overseen) machines in factories while the Terrans were using completely
roboticised factories of tremendous output, and that they simply buried the
Vilani in mass produced high tech weapons and few troops. It fits the facts as
well as anything else!

Yep, but I think we must regard all this as one of the "non-canon" developments
by DGP. I\'ve never seen the "Rats & Cats" supplement ... which, given the
generally lousy distribution for DGP stuff here in Oz would seem to indicate it
must have been quite late in the piece, in MTrav terms. You see, as I\'ve
explained above, cloning of body parts isn\'t even possible until TL/13 ...
something the Terrans didn\'t reach until the very end (or after, IIRC) the
collapse of the Ziru Sirka. Ergo, R&C is non-canon as it contradicts specific
TL data in MTRav Referee\'s Companion. Also note that this is made worse by teh
fact that Partial Memory Dupe isn\'t available until TL/18! So even if the
clones could be made, then there was no way that they could be force grown and
given adult personalities ... which means that all the adult pop of the colony
would have to spend all their time cleaning their nappies and bottle feeding
them. Not on, if you think about it/

I have never seen such an implication. Where is it so implied? In any case, it
surely couldn\'t apply 100% until after the final collapse ... after all, the
lower castes couldn\'t be sure that their masters wouldn\'t win eventually!

This brings up another interesting question.  Is there a minimum amount of
time that you can spend in a lo berth, and exactly how much do you age in a
lo berth (1 sec per day, one sec per year, etc)?  If an average person (70
year life) slept every evening (8 hours) in a lo berth, would they add years
on to their life?  The amount of time spent sleeping would be equal to 23.33
years.  This would also have an effect on aging rolls.  This could have some
effects on the adventuring age of PC\'s.

All too true.  I used to figure on a 4 ton stateroom being about 4.5m by 3m
allotting 1 ton displacement for common areas. (this is garnered from the
deck plans from Book 7 etc. with 1 ton being 2 x 1.5m squares.)  Still to
look at a room that is 3m wide (almost 10ft) by 4.5m long (15ft) (for the
metric impaired) leaves a relatively spacious stateroom (150 sqft).
Assuming things like the bed folds away, as does the desk etc.  Not really
any room for things like guests etc, but from a military standpoint
extremely roomy.  In modern US ships the crewmember gets about 72 cuft
8\'x3\'x3\' to sleep in with about another 8 cuft for a footlocker.  You cram
as many in as possible and then give them a comman area to mess/lounge in.
Now TNE uses the 4 ton stateroom as the large variety and it claims that the
2 ton small stateroom can be used fro double occupancy.  That would mean a
new stateroom that is 3mx3m or 10\'x10\'.  Unfortunately now two must share
probably with bunks.  It is livible esp as you are rarely in your cabin but
rather on duty for 12 hours a shift.  You then sleep for 8 and only have to
lounge for 4 hours.

The end result is that yes more tonnage is needed for staterooms etc.
especially on non-military vessels.  On military vessels you can use such
areas as hangers etc for extra lounge areas.  Unfortunately Spaceships don\'t
have decks that are pretty much wasted on model sailing ships.

Actually I offer a differing point of view.  Although the Navy would like to
cram people in like sardines.  They also acknowledge that the poeple must
have room to do their two primary duties.  First of all fight and repair
battle damage, and secondly perform constant maintainence on the ship
(mostly to keep everyone busy).  The Navy would likely install redundant
components where ever possible and will almost always make sure that every
component can be services while under weigh.  Then end result is a good deal
of maintainance space (which I have always allocated (a 100 ton power plant
actually is only 60 tons in size, but requires 40 tons of work area around it).

Anyway I hope that this helps.

Well, my last apartment was *smaller* than that and wasn\'t all that
cramped.

Remember, 16 m^2 is 4m by 4m or a bit over 13 feet on a side. I had a
*huge* \'fresher (due to regulations about handicapped access), and the
rest of the place was adequate as long as you didn\'t have much
furniture of your own. The included furniture was a bed with a
"pedestal" base (ie storage drawers under it), a wardrobe, a desk &
chair, a nightstand, a dorm fridge and a microwave. As well as several
"kitchen cabinets" in the area with the sink, counter, fridge &
microwave.

It was "cosy", but not cramped. I was able to add a second desk (for
the computer) and two bookcases and still have space to move around
easily.

Just stripping out the "mini-kitchen" aspect would have made a marked
increase in free space.

So the 4 tons for the stateroom is reasonable, even if it gives up
*some* space for corridors and common areas. But I wouldn\'t count on it
being more than 10% unless you go to the "fresher is down the hall"
style. If you do, then you could probably manage 50%.

        True, but I\'d still bet the Navy has less "waste" space allocated to
people than does a luxury liner. Obviously, a carrier is going to have
gobs\'o\'volume in the hangar deck, but as far as lounges, bars, spacious
cabins ... nope. I\'d just like rules that differentiate more between various
types of ships. Les Howie mentioned something about a "comfort rating" based
on the waste space _allocated to people_ -- I can see a range of values.
Really low affects crew morale and efficiency; slightly higher is bearable;
passengers expect more; luxury passengers expect gobs.

        It would also depend on time -- long voyages in extremely cramped
confines would really affect morale, but the a two-day trip to a nearby moon
would be fine.

        Your apartment had less than 170 square feet? I find that

        You\'d need much more than 10% -- have you looked at any deckplans?
And while your apartment may not have seemed _too_ small, try staying in it
for two weeks, without being able to go outside ... just walking out your
front door gives you the mental "elbow room" to be psychologically
comforting. If you actually had to live in that tiny space for most of your
day, except to walk a few meters down a corridor to another room where you
worked, you\'d be much less happy.

        I\'m not saying the staterooms themselves are too small _for a
stateroom_ ... there\'s just not enough _other_ room allowed for all the
other stuff that allegedly comes out of that volume.

In the Norwegian navy we got a sub class called ULA. There the crew has to
share the bunks, and that sub is really cramped. Still they are out 14 days
at a time.

I was on board a missile patrol boat and bunked with 13 others in a bunkarea
not larger than a large stateroom in Traveller.

When I design warships I install small staterooms to the officers and bunks
to the general crew.

true, but those numbers are what *could* happen doulbling evey hundred years

also many women decide to have childrenafter they have spent some time on

looks it up... yes, it has been a while... I normaly play GURPS Traveller
in the NE basic rules it does say so, but in FFS it makes no mention of it.
I would make that a yearly or perhaps monthy charge, per jump just doen\'t

never need to pay this charge?

Is it possible for the Imperials to win?

It seems to me that if the Zhodanis speed through the map as fast as

to do enough damage before they leave the other side with the base

Well, I think "sleeping" in a low berth can be looked upon as being more
or less frozen, that is, aging is negligible; thus sleeping in a low berth
at night would see to it that you didn\'t age at night, but you wouldn\'t
get any actual sleep either.

As low berths slow the basal metabolic rate of an individual, then yes it
should be possible to extend the life of a person quite considerably. A 70
year old will have slept for approximately 23-24 years of their life.
Possibly more in my case when i\'ve got to 70 (if i get to 70). :)

Even if low berths only halved the metabolic rate during hibernation, then
12 years could be added to an average life span. I suspect that the
metabolic rate will be slowed more than this adding on more years, during
hibernation in low births.

Do low births still have an inherent risk requiring medical personnel to
monitor the wake up procedure? This could work out costly having a
qualified medic on call to wake you up every morning. Even with a medic,
how often does it all go wrong and waking up leaves the person dead?

Does the risk of low births justify the long term effect? You may get a 10
or so extra years but it won\'t do any good if you don\'t get that far.

The only thing I\'d like to point out here is that if the body is in
stasis, the normal things that take place during sleep don\'t.  Spending 8
hours a night in a low berth would not be the same as gettning 8 hours of
non-hibernation sleep.  One would still have to find time to engage in
normal sleep.  Yes, you might be able to add 23 years to your life, but
you will also have to "sleep" a total of 16 hours a day, give or take.
Not a very viable way to extend life.

Yes, you are correct. Our theories only cover the early stages of Solomani
expansion. The "massive numbers" theory might work; are the Vilani
socialized against cloning? Maybe the Solomani used WW2 Soviet-style
strategy and tactics. After all, it worked in WW2. But, see below, since at
some times the Solomani seem to be inferior and at other times superior to
the Vilani.

Another point: are we all (the list) agreed that Solomani TL tops out at 13
vs. the Vilani 12? If so, when are meson guns invented? I saw somewhere that
they also provided a huge moral adavantage to the Solomani and that the
Vilani (at that time) were helpless against them.

How about this for an off the wall theory:

The Solomani, during periods of peace, take positions in the Vilani Imperium
as administrators, mercenaries, etc. and help prop up the Vilani against the
Vargr, internal dissidents, and other struggles. The Vilani have to forfeit
a large portion of central goverment revenues to their governors, while the
stronger (i.e. more central) Solomani government can spend more on R&D,
since the have cut out the middleman (simply by virtue of having colonies
cloe to the home world) more than the Vilani. Maybe a group of Solomani
space marines could be a kind of "Praetorian Guard" for the Emperor.  Over
time, Solomani are rewarded with citizenship, lands, titles, etc. We all
assume Estigaribbia was a *Solomani* admiral. Maybe he was Solomani-born,
serving in the *Vilani* Navy. He convinced his fleet to make a grab for the
Throne, and brought in his countrymen (what do you call others from your
planet? Worldmen? Planetmen?) as back up. So now we have the Solomani and a
Vilani fleet together. Is this enough to defeat the Vilani? I don\'t know. If
you take this, plus the idea that the Solomani may have agents at high
levels in the Vilani government, I think it is possible, even if the
Confederation does not have a massive population.

If the Vilani government was thrown into chaos by Solomani agents, many
Solomani in high position defected, and a few Solomani ships were equipped
with meson guns (these ships are screened by Estigaribbia\'s Vilani fleet), I
think it is possible that the government would topple.

Two points of problem:
1. Why would the Vilani let a Solomani be an Admiral of a powerful fleet?
Maybe the Vilani kept hostages, used their own agents, or tried to co-opt
Estigaribbia (I\'ll call him The Big E from now on)with riches, etc. I don\'t
think that this is that big a problem, becuse in this theory, The Big E is
only acting like a Vilani (taking his shot at the throne). It just so
happens his people have a super-weapon or two as well.

2. Tech stuff: Can anyone back up this stuff from a tech perspective? I
don\'t have my source material available right now.

As always, this stuff will be played out (although we are a long way from
the Rule of Man), so any comments are appreciated. I\'m sure that there are
*lots* of problems I haven\'t thought about.

TL-12 High-Performance SDB Jump Shuttle
----

This odd starship design was originally appropriated by the planetary
flotilla of the Jewell/Jewell system shortly after the Fourth Frontier
War.  Experiences in that war caused the local navy to decide that it
would be desirable to have a number of jump-capable craft under their
direct control as a flexible defense force against Zhodani invasion.
Normally, the textbook solution is to assign a number of corvettes or
destroyer-escorts to this mission, backing up SDBs in pre-arranged
defensive positions throughout the system.

Instead, the Jewell Navy chose to build a number of specialized "jump
shuttles" to give a select number of their system defense boats short
range jump capability without restricting their ability to maneuver.
While this defeats the basic tenet of SDB design, it was considered
more economical and flexible than building tech-12 system corvettes
from scratch.  For instance, the shuttle can be used to recover
disabled or damaged SDBs from the outer system and return them to base
for repair.  However, this vehicle almost costs as much as a second SDB.

This craft takes advantage of the standard jump shuttle dock located
on the stern of the Shukugan.  When docked, it completely blocks the
SDB\'s maneuver drive, so all power and reaction mass are diverted to
the shuttle\'s large engines.  A total of 1578 MW is provided by the
host SDB to run the shuttle active sensor and maneuver drive.  When
not docked, the shuttle only has enough power to accelerate itself
to four gee.  Both craft are streamlined.

The ship\'s bridge is located in a blister on the starboard side of
the craft, giving it a view which is somewhat blocked by the mass of
the SDB when docked.  Jumps are coordinated from this bridge, and it
is able to assume maneuver control of the docked craft if necessary.
Typically, the shuttle is commanded by an officer with the rank of
sublieutenant.  When docked, the captain of the shuttle is considered
the chief engineer of the combined vehicle.

This entire craft is considered to be a standard module which is custom-
built for the Shukugan-class SDB.  Therefore, according to the RC Equipment
Guide, small-craft grapples are not necessary for the ships to achieve a
hard dock.  Other 2800 kL box configuration modules could be designed for
the SDB and assumed to be custom built, but remember that the docking point
blocks the Shukugan\'s maneuver drive.

Design is inspired by the original jump shuttle in _Traders & Gunboats_.

YES!  I couldn\'t *believe* the inadequate active sensor on the SDB when
I looked at the design.  Ugh.  That\'s why I gave the jump shuttle such a
nice active sensor -- the ship really needs it.  Another gripe -- who
put a purification plant in a ship with *no jump drive*?

No the Nevy crams the crew in very tight, and then relien on the fact that
there is LOTS of wasted space on any moden sea going vessel.  One of the
problems with traveller is the concept of 110% volume for small craft.
Personally I think 200% would be a better estimate.  The reaon is that you
cannot always go EVA to work on a small craft, and you are constantly
working on the ship (else the enginners would go stir crazy!)  That space is
"wasted" when not in use, and can then be used for makeshift lounges etc.
Also cargo holds are not usually filled to capacity so a little bit of space
is available there.

>types of ships. Les Howie mentioned something about a "comfort rating" based
>on the waste space _allocated to people_ -- I can see a range of values.
>Really low affects crew morale and efficiency; slightly higher is bearable;
>passengers expect more; luxury passengers expect gobs.
>

IN the case of Luxury Liners, or even most passenger liners there would have
to be LOTS of space deveoted to lounges etc.  Take a look at the deck plans
for the QEII sometime.  She has something like 5 swimming pools 3 dinning
rooms, even a bowling alley.  Remember that most ships in the game are small
free traders that take on a few passengers for a little extra money.  This
would be not unlike hitching a berth on a freighter going to Europe or
somewhere else.  You expect a room, some food, and nothing else!  On a
Princess Lines ship (the Love Boat) you expect a great deal more!

The major problem here is that the price for travel is set artificially at
10,000CR for a high passage.  In reality, no self repecting high passenger
would take a berth on a 200 ton freighter!  Besides 10,000CR for 1 week?
Thats 1,400+CR per day.  Now most of that MIGHT be considered travel expense
(like an airplane) but Traveller has always tried to represent Space Travel
like Ocean travel in the 20th.  A five day trip on the Queen Mary from New
York to Liverpool is about $1000 for first class.  For 10,000CR I would
expect a very nice stateroom really travelling first class.  Most people
cannot afford 10,000CR to take a trip to another planet (Imagine the family
of 4 going on a holiday for 4 weeks to another planet 80,000CR just for
travel!)  If that is the case then no one would ever go anywhere.  My
solution would be this.  People are hard to transport, cargo is relatively
easy.  The price for transporting cargo is a little low in my opinion its
about 1/2 what it should be.  And what about priority transport cargo
(Imperial Express When it positively has to be there next week!)  Those
costs could be MUCH higher on the order of 10000Cr+ per ton.  I mean it
costs 32 cents to mail a letter in the USA, but almost $10 to mail it
overnight! (3000% cost increase).  Cargo becomes the primary job of a
freighter, and liners cater to passengers.  I mean 1 steward for 8
passengers works when you have 80 passengers and 10 stewards, but not when
you have only 1 steward.  I would not want to work 24hrs a day catering to
people.

Additionally the rules state that it still costs 10,000Cr for two people to
travel together  Bull Puckey.  There should be allowances for double
occupancy just like for crew.  Then you charge say only 50% or ticket price
and sell the other stateroom.  The Life Support on a freighter or any
commercial ship sould always have some built in redundancy to allow for say
a 50% increase in passengers, else how could you pick up survivors from a
disabled ship etc.

Lastly on this topic.  The service industry (hotels, Airlines, etc) are
notorious for overbooking their accomodations.  An interesting adventure
seed might be when the players are trying to get out of dodge on a liner
when they discover that their reservations have boon overbooked.  They can
get a free upgrade by waiting for the next liner out in 2 weeks!

On Another vein.

I too find it hard to believe that in an apartment that small unless it is

I always assumed that low berth stoped all biological processes, so if
you went into low berth needing sleep, you would emerge from low berth
needing sleep. I assume that people don\'t age at all in low berth.

 Also low berth is risky, and possibly fatal, so its not something to
do unless you are desperate.

   That\'s true of right now, but on the larger scale of things, birth rates
tend fluctuate depending on cultural influences.  Here in the U.S. there
was a veritable population explosion after World War 2.  That followed a
period during the Great Depression when birth rate were much lower
than they are now.  To look say that the world population will top out at
an arbitrary figure like 11 billion ignores all kinds of potential events
between now and the end of the 21st century.

>The First Interstellar war starts in 2096,

   Wrong, the First Interstellar War begins in 2110, some 14 years after
first contact, and some 24 years after the Solomani after discovered
jump drive.

>Considering the small amounts of people that you could probably

   The colonization of Prometheus would have been accomplished easily
enough.  An entire Earth-like planet, totally devoid of people a mere two
week\'s journey away.  People would flock in droves at the opportunity to
colonize.  Of course in their haste they would probably cause a near
ecological disaster on Prometheus, as native flora and fauna are pushed
aside by imported Terran stock.  Even that would probably not slow the
growth of the colony.  Remember, the original Solomani Rim sourcebook
by GDW described the discovery of Prometheus as being, "as
momentous as the discovery of fire."  Sounds like an exodus followed to
me.

   You could easily develop a commune system in which several families
live in a close cluster of dwellings.  Two of the adults could handle the
child care responsibilities while the other 4-8 could work outside the
home.  Much more efficient system.  Not all the women would be
pregnant all the time, even with my suggested rate of growth.

   My figures are based partially on figures in the TNE sourcebook.  A
moderately conservative growth rate would have the population doubling
every 70 years.

   Granted, how easily a world is absorbed would vary from location to
location, but we are told in the Traveller text that overall it was relatively
easily accomplished.  Assuming that the "Terran occupation forces"
includes a few hundred marines and a naval officer who acts as Chief
Administrator over the existing Vilani bureaucracy, you could gobble up a
lot of real estate in a short time.

   Oops! You\'re right.  It was the Second Imperium (Rule of Man) that

   There is mention of robot substitutes for crew in both MegaTraveller

program them with ship operation skills?  True, there\'s nothing that says
"one robot can replace x number of crew," but it only takes a little
common sense to figure things out.

   Perhaps not, but they would be a natural extension of existing and
soon to be developed medical technology here on 20th century Earth.
Ever hear of an incubator?

   As for clones, I think that S:AAB does an excellent job of pointing out
the kinds of problems that would develop when you start dumping
cloned humans into society.  Clones of humans would probably be
unthinkable ethically prior to first contact with the Vilani, but an attractive
alternative to being squashed like a bug after the Terrans realize what
they are up against.

   More expensive perhaps, but not necessarily prohibitively so.  As for
raising them, the old fashion way would work just fine--again,
adjustments would have to take place in society at large.

>But, as I have pointed out, there is no evidence that the

   And there is no evidence that they didn\'t.  I merely present a theory that
fits the existing canon.  If you wish to ignore canon, that\'s up to you.

>*Exactly* what I have proposed ... and I suggest that it is this

   Treason against the existing power structure perhaps, but it is also
possible that he was motivated by a genuine love for the Confederation,
and he realized that what the civilian government wanted to do would
inevitably result in a premature end to all that he and his comrades (and
generations before him) strived, and in some cases sacrificed their lives,
to achieve.

   This might make an interesting story, but it is not canon.  Canon
indicates that he did so with the approval of the majority of the
Confederation population.

   Perhaps not totally automated, but automated to a much larger degree
than is currently possible.  Imagine the Americans, Japanese, Brits,
Germans, et. al. working cooperatively to solve the problem of rapid
industrial expansion.  No question that the Terrans could have pulled it
off.

Frankly they don\'t even need to go all that fast.  Replacing the
Gazelles with Fireys would help since at least a missile hit will do
criticals to little scouts.

In unmodified BL you\'re right, they just crank up the actives and lock
the sucker up.  The writers played the game using their assumptions
about the rules, but not the rules if you catch my meaning (that or they
wrote the scenarios without actually playing them).

They _meant_ for passive sensors to be more useful because actives would
draw too much attention.  The rules for any real purposes don\'t penalize
active sensors at all, so passives are basically bad sensors, and
actives are good sensors.

There are a couple of alternate sensor rules out there on the web sites.
Mine\'re on the beta archives, and Andrew\'s are someplace else----they
were published in that 3rd party traveller magazine (sorry, forgot the
title, but it\'s a cool magazine).  Both sets correct this "problem" to
some degree.  Adding anti-radiation missiles that are kinetic kill
weapons doesn\'t hurt, either :-)

  Actually, I had considered it.  I rejected it due to the fact that by
using those rules, you end up with a ridiculously small amount of deck
space allocated to recreation.  It makes sense when you try to account for
hallways, though - On a 1x1x3.5 meter deck plan, simply cut 1/2 meter off
the "long" measurement of the stateroom and use it for empty space.  This
gives you a LSR measuring 4x3.5 meters, a SSR measuring 2x3.5 meters and a
bunk area of 2x1.5 meters.  Put two rooms across from each other, and you
get 1 meter of hall space in between, roughly the same as you find on
submarines or aircraft carriers.
  But the crew still needs a recreation area and sanitation facilities, and
a SSR simply doesn\'t have the volume for this, especially if you
double-bunk it.  Large SR\'s have enough space for shower, \'fresher, vanity,
closet, bunk (two if necessary) and a small desk.  Bunks have barely enough
space for a bed and overhead bin.
  More on life support:  Kitchens and dining areas can be added, for those
who prefer "real" food to the processed crap (no pun intended).  Assume a
basic kitchen size of 1 1/2 Dtons (21 kl), with storage space for two
man-months of food.  Larger kitchens add more storage at 7kl per 2
man-months\' storage.  Price at about MCr0.06 (seems reasonable), Mass 2.0,
Power 0.001MW.  Dining rooms are just another recreation room.  Of course,
this adds another crewmember position (Cook).

  But anyway, I have a game to get ready for.  And a set of Small Arms
laser rules to rewrite...anyone have any helpful suggestions (or even
unhelpful ones)?

Dear Folks -

1.BOUNTY HUNTERS

In #606, Simon suggested:
>And if this is a normal way of tracking felons, there\'s likely to be a Hunters
>Aid organisation of some kind operating on any world with a class A,B,or C

An excellent reference for bounty hunters is "Dead or Alive", published in an
early _White Dwarf_ (I only have v. old copies, can someone come up with the
issue number? Andy Lilly, perhaps?).

The article outlined "The Bounty Hunter as a Career in Traveller", according to
the Book 2-style of PC generation.

It suggested that the problem of capture, given the size of the Imperium, would
prevent any Imperial "police force" from being cost-effective. Instead, a
cheaper alternative is to offer bounties. Four categories were suggested:

"1.Alive. A reward for the capture of the wanted individual."
"2.Dead or Alive. A bounty permitting the return of a dead offender for a
lesser amount than one who is alive (eg. Alive: Cr2000, dead: Cr1000)."
"3.Dead or Alive. A flat rate reward for the offender or the offender\'s
corpse."
"4.Dead, This is reserved for the most dangerous criminals who have usually
been sentenced to death *in absentia*. The reward is for the execution
of the felon. It is frowned upon by the Imperium and most central
authorities. Many planets consider the \'execution\' of the felon on
their soil as murder." (p 26).

Yes, very "Wild West", but after all, that *is* how we were originally told to
view the Marches.

Note that "The Zhodani Conspiracy" computer game (story by MM) used the fourth
system constantly - without the bad side-effects. You could zap a bad guy, and
all the bureaucracy would say was "Well done, here is your reward."

As for organisation, the artical postulated that "several corporations have
been formed and the Imperium has laid down a code of conduct and instituted an
organisation of its own." (p 26). The best hunters could even apply for an
Imperial Warrant (!!! - a bit over the top, in my view).

Possible material benefits included anti-security tools, weapons, combat armour,
and a Type-H Hunter 100t starship (for former members of the corporations
noted above). The deck plans are drawn *excellently* by Nick Weeks, and are
the best part of the article (IMO). Before Seeker began doing their detailed
plans, this one existed (what was good? oh, things like the 10t fuel
compartments, the revolving vehicle bay for the enclosed air/raft, the very
detailed seating plans and entertainment consoles, the way they were organised
like tech blueprints, the electrified hull and security system run by the
"Watchdog" security program, the cells and low berths that include the
6G floor field around them in case of escape attempts... when all we had was
_Traders and Gunboats_, this was a ship to drool over).

The only thing missing was the idea of a "Hunter\'s Guild" as suggested by
Simon. I see no reason *not* to include one, if you allow the bounty hunter
idea into your campaign. Presumably you would get similar benefits to TAS.

(All material from: "Dead or Alive", Diane and Richard John, _White Dwarf ??_,
Games Workship, UK, 198?, pp26-27).

2.UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND RIGHTS

>In Oz (and, so I gather, in many European countries) Unemployment Benefits are
>regarded as a *right* ... if the government cannot manage the economy well
>enough to provide for close to full employment for all, then I think most
>Australians agree that they have a responsibility to provide for a basic
>standard of living for those who cannot find work.

Have you heard this one:

An American, a Scotsman, and an Aussie were sitting a pub in the outback.
Suddenly, a road train crashed right through the place, killing the three men
and just missing the bartender and (thankfully) the grog. ;-) Just as the
bartender was picking himself up and brushing off the bull-dust, the Yank
reappeared.
"What happened?" asked the bartender.
"Well", replied the American, "a moment ago, the three of us were standing in
front of St Peter at the pearly gates. He said that we could come in if we each
paid him 10 bucks. So I paid him, and that\'s why I\'m back here."
"And the others?"
"Well, the Scotsman is haggling over the price, and the Aussie thinks that the
government should pay it."

3.REALITY AND TRAVELLER

Angus MCLELLAN said:
>Stuff reality; let\'s have an internally consistent system that feels right.

Amen to that. In my belief, the major problem with TNE - the one that led
to all the symptoms (techhead vs classics arguments) - is that it, _by itself_,
IS internally consistent - but it is not consistent with previous versions of
Traveller.

>What we don\'t need is something filled with doom, gloom and pornographic
>violence, as in the pathetic efforts of pimps like Drake and Stirling.

Stirling I don\'t know, but are you referring to _David_ Drake?

4.GG REFUELLING VULNERABILITY

Merrick asked for some rationale as to why GG refuelling leaves your ship at
risk.

"Refuelling operations for a task force are another danger point, as forces
which are low on fuel and maneuvering in a gravity well are especially
vulnerable". (_High Guard_, p 19)

However, the abstract movement system provides no disadvantages. Perhaps the
concept is a hangover derived from _Book 2: Starships_. This book uses a drawn
vector combat system and has two esp. relevant rules:gravity effects on
movement, and atmospheric braking. For example, Jupiter\'s world template would
show 2.6 G\'s at the edge of its atmosphere - very significant for refuelling.

And yes, these would be house rules if added to the other flavours of space
combat rules.

Also, how about:
- high-speed skimming leads to pre-determined and predictable vectors; and/or
the extra load on your drives and CG field leave little room for evasive
maneuvers;
- the old Star Trek saw about nebulae could apply: being in a GG affects your
sensors. The guys outside can still track you due to the increased energy
output coming from the extra work your drives/CG field are doing in the GG\'s
high gravity.

BTW, an SDB may not be able to hurt a CruRon or BatRon - but if it is sitting
in a GG, its real targets are the fuel tankers, no? Look at the Azhanti High
Lightning\'s fuel shuttles: only 40G armour, 2G, no agility, DefDM +9 (MT stats
from_Arrival Vengance_). Knock out a few of these, and suddenly an
unstreamlined strike force is in trouble.

And Craig said:
>This also suggests a fairly striking discovery -- that a ship without CG
>can\'t effectively skim a gas giant! Comments, anyone?

Use thrusters. ;-)

5.SIMON\'S <insert superlative here> PROGRAM

I agree with John Bogan\'s wants for the display (esp. the CENTRE function key).
However, these may have to be relegated to version 2 (!!).

Perhaps a simple suggestion for the planet\'s locations around the central star
is to use a variant of the system at the back of _The Starship Operator\'s
Manual_. This gave a simple dice roll for the location of one planet from
another. Reiterate for the whole system. (Perhaps use a consistent random seed
to get the same base result for a system, then add orbital movement based on
date?? I don\'t know, just trying to make the planets move for the next time
the PC\'s go there).

The main point of the _SOM_ idea is to simplify orbit locations: 4 or 6 sectors
per orbit, then calc a rough (ie. simplified but playable) travel distance.

If you want detailed system info, why not ask Marcus L. Rowland (a long-time
Traveller contributor) how he did things like that for his _World Generator_
program. Sorry I don\'t have a contact e-mail; can BITS help here?

6.STREAMLINING

Wow, while looking up the fleet tactics in _MT Journal #2_, I also found the
final upgrades to the MT streamlining definitions!!

Here they are:

"Unstreamlined: No attempt has been made to streamline the hull. Many
protrusions and irregularities exist which significantly increase the vessel\'s
drag, making it difficult or impossible to operate the craft in an atmosphere
at a high rate of speed."
"Streamlined: Various cowlings and fairings have been added to the hull to
streamline it for operation in an atmosphere, although the streamlining is less
than that provided by an airframe. This configuration is equivalent to the
\'partially streamlined\' configuration found in _High Guard_."
"Airframe: The hull has been designed for high performance in an atmosphere. In
order to achieve such performance, exterior design has been a priority. This
configuration is equivalent to the \'streamlined\' configuration found in _High
Guard_."

The Q&A also talked about the HG definitions, and the unfortunate early errata
referance to HG.

And a further explanation is given:

"Before we leave this question, let\'s explain a bit more what we had in mind
when we created these three types from the older two types."
"Airframe indicates the configuration generates its own _lift_ in an
atmosphere. In other words, the craft could actually glide to a landing without
power if it had to. Streamlined, on the other hand, means the craft\'s
configuration does not provide much in the way of lift, separate from its power
source (a helicopter is a good example of an SL configuration - take away its
power and it will drop like a rock)."
"The SL configuration, does however allow for atmospheric flight at reasonable
speeds, and thus does allow for landing on a world\'s surface. And unstreamlined
craft cannot land on a world with an atmosphere value of 2 or greater, nor can
an unstreamlined configuration skim a gas giant for fuel."

(all quoted text is from _The MegaTraveller Journal #2_, Joe D. Fugate Sr.,
DGP, Woodburn, Oregon, USA, 1991, p 26)

Now, at the risk of inciting *yet another* flame war over this, here are my
dot points:
- it appears that only the atmosphere is a problem, not the gravity of a world
  (an unstreamlined craft can apparently support itself against gravity);
- under SL it talks about "atmospheric flight at reasonable speeds" and that
  USL cannot be operated at high speed - but what about at much slower speeds?
- BUT distance from orbit is not a vertical 300 km drop - can anyone tell me
  how far the Shuttle travels from the point it re-enters to the point it
  touches down? Is 5000 km a good guess?
- If the thing "floats" down, it will presumably be subject to wind (as an
  earlier poster stated) - distance travelled ("blown") should be comparable
  to distance normally "flown";
- If 5000 km is a good guess, then a USL ship, travelling at its "safe" speed
  of 40 kph - oh, lets be generous and say it travels like a brick, sorry, Mac
  truck, and does, oh, 100 kph;
- At 100 kph, it takes 50 _hours_ to touch down (just over 2 days!);
- At 40 kph (in comparision), it takes 125 _hours_ to land (5 days 5 hours!!);
- This is not economically feasable, nor would many worlds allow their flight
  paths to be regularly clogged for this long;
- Presumably this technique also requires some major Piloting rolls.

My conclusion is that allowing USL ships to land will not break canon, as long
as the following applies:
- it is risky (make many Piloting rolls at increased difficulty levels);
- it take a _long_ time to get anywhere;
- it is generally only done in emergencies.

Finally, remember this is only a _game_ - and you are the DM! You can allow
what you like into your campaign - be it j-torps, thrusters, blaster pistols,
USL ships landing - be it on your own head! (personally, I _like_ thrusters!)
_You_ are the one who has to control game balance and mesh any introduced
technology with your history.

If the worst comes to the worst, and the players want to do something that you
don\'t want to allow - don\'t just tell them no! (you don\'t want to stifle the
creativity of the little beggars now, do you? ;-) Just roll some dice, pretend
to look up some tables, mumble a bit, and _THEN_ say "No". (Sorry Andrew ;-)

   In a Brilliant Lances game some time ago, I was able to use the
Shukugan\'s missiles as remote active sensor drones.  Deploying
practically every missile on board, I sent them in the general direction
of the enemy, figuring at least one of the missiles would get a lock-on
of some kind.  The tactic worked, and the target (a Gazelle which
fortunately wasn\'t evading very well) recieved multiple missile hits and
was totally disabled.

   The design theory goes something like, ``SDB by their very nature
do not need large active EMS arrays.  They lie await in ambush, hoping
some ship or other makes the mistake of getting too close to a gas
giant, asteroid field, or a world with large oceans.  When that happens,
the SDB uses *passive * sensors to achieve a lock-on  (thus greatly
reducing the possibility of detection) and then fires off a number of
prepositioned missiles which kill the target.``

>Another gripe --who put a purification plant in a ship with *no jump
>drive*?

   This would allow the SDB to operate for months at a time without
having to come in for refueling, something that would be an operational
advantage given how they fight.

   In summary, the Shukugan-class isn\'t *that* bad for a TL12 SDB, so
long as you know how to deploy it.  Would I design it differently?  Of
course, but then you can pretty much improve on any design, given
enough time and motivation.

Harold

  I am in the planning stages of an RC campaign, and I wanted to write up a
article about the various worlds of the RC, so my players could have a bit of
info on each world, and also allow them to pick a homeworld. Since none of them
has ever played traveller before, I expanded out the USP into words.
  I tried to use what was said in various RC handbooks, mainly POT but
also Star Vikings.   I also expanded where I felt it was needed. I
think this is also a good starting point for writing up full articles
on each world.  I think Eamon said he was writing up one on Baldur.
   I think this is very much a first draft, I\'d like other people to
contribute, expand or suggest alternatives to these writeups.  Some of
them I really like, others are okay but could use improvement.  On Eos,
I drew a total blank.
Most ideas we can combine into one world, but if there are two totally
contridictary ideas, we can always have options, ie Oriflamme 1 and Oriflamme 2.

Apollo  E8C5300-8
          Size: Large : D=12,800km              Atmosphere: Insidious

          Tech Level: 8 (1990\'s)                Star port: Frontier
        The entire native population died off during the Final War.
Now freelance prospectors search the ruins for technological treasures.
Most of the pre-war civilization was located below ground, in huge sprawling
tunnels.
        The McDermont family from Aurora has set up a minimal starport at the
site of a pre-war airport.  They offer unrefined fuel, berthing sites, and
operate a small general store which sells almost anything. They buy relics
from the prospectors and resell them to the crew of the Free Trader
Anarchist which makes regular stops at the starport.

Aubaine A78A884-C
          Size: Large : D=11,000km              Atmosphere: Dense
          Hydrographics:100%                    Population:150 million Humans
                                                           650 milion Schalli
          Government: Civil Service Bureaucracy Law Level:Moderate
          Tech Level: 12 (Avg Stellar)          Star port: Excellent
        Aubaine is a water world, with most human civilization located on
the many small islands that dot the ocean.  Aubaine is the true home of
the Schalli, who are known by that name due to political wrangling in the Last
Imperium, which denied that the Schalli were truly intelligent.  Anyone
who has seen the Schalli at work, knows that is a lie.
Aubaine is the seat of the Coalition government, the Assembly of Worlds is
located on the largest island group.  Here represenitives from each Coalition
world gather to decided issues effecting the future.
        The Aubaine is also site of the Hiver Technical Accademy, and
the Aubani are very close to the Hivers.  The Aubani have a vision for the
future, that has the Coalition expanding across the wreckage of the Imperium.
Other Coalition members feel that the Aubani are arrogant, but the Aubani
deny this saying that only they can see how the Coalition is a small island
of sanity in the vast oceans of space, and that it could easily be swept
away by the rising tide of chaos. Aubaine is the center of the Federalist
movement.

Aurora B576646-B
          Size: Medium : D=8000km               Atmosphere:Standard tainted
          Hydrographics: 60%                    Population: 7 million
          Government: Representative Democracy  Law Level:Moderate
          Tech Level: 11 (Avg Stellar)          Star port: Good
        The headquarters of the Reformation Coalition Navy is located on
Aurora.  This along with their high tech shipyards will make Aurora a center
for shipbuilding, once the shipyards get upgraded.  Before the Final War
Aurora was a colony of Macis, which is now called Apollo.  The Collapse
severed ties between the two worlds.  Resenting the fact that their
planet was formerly owned by the Macins, Aurora became a democracy, and to
this day they resent strong governmental controls.  The effects of the Collapse
were severe, but the Aurorans banded togethor and by making a concerted
effort were able to rebuild.  By 1170 Aurora had regained her old Tech Level,
and had begun to advance past it.  It didn\'t have the capacity to build jump
drives, so it was forced to remain isolated.  In 1192, the Hivers made
contact, and Aurora was able to purchase jump drives.  It was a charter
member of the Dawn Leage, and an early proponent of the Reformation Coalition.
Aurora has become a staunch supporter of the Federalists, feeling that a
strong extraplanetary government would take away the freedoms that individual
worlds now possess.

Baldur CAAA756-9
          Size: Large : D=16,000km              Atmosphere: Exotic
          Hydrographics:100%                    Population: 30 million
          Government:Feudal Technocracy         Law Level: Moderate
          Tech Level: 9 (circa 2010)            Star port: Routine
        Baldur is a deathworld, its atmosphere is poisonous to most life, it
is covered with seas of acid, and high gravity pulls at everything.
It is only through human ingeniuity that life is sustained. The Baduri
lived in vast underwater cities, on man made islands, and above it all in
orbital habitats.  The Collapse threatend all of these. The Virus crashed
the orbital habitats into the sea, threatened to open the airlocks on the
subsurface cities, and tried to capsize the floating islands.  It was only
through relentless effort, and great technical skill, that all life on the
planet was saved from destruction. The Balduri know that life hangs by a
thread, and the only thing between the RC and screaming chaos is the will
to survive.

Enkidu E510415-9
          Size: Medium : D=8000                 Atmosphere: Trace
          Hydrographics: None                   Population: 50 thousand
          Government: Corporate                 Law Level: Moderate
          Tech Level: 9 (circa 2010)            Star port: Frontier
        Before the Collapse Enkidu was named Dono.  It was owned by a council
of five corporations.  These weren\'t megacorporations, just small planetary
companies.  They were Westlake Industries, Mogon Technologies, Cynder Data
Systems, United Power Systems, and Blenkindo Enterprises.  Each corporation
had its own territory, and used it to produce products for export throughout
the subsector.  During fighting between the Solomani Confederation and Lucan\'s
Imperium, the planet\'s infrastructure was damaged beyond repair.  The five
corporations banded togethor to evacuate the planet.  Unfortunately five
million people is beyond the scope of anyone to evacuate, the corporations
managed to get a mere thirty thousand to saftey, before the planet died.
        The survivors fled to Hite (now known as Nike Nimbus), where they
kept alive the dream of someday returning to their homes.  The first generation
of refugees died without fufilling their dream. Today their
grandchildren are finally able to return home.  The five corporations
were able to stay intact on Hite, and on the founding of the Dawn
League, began making plans to return home.
        On 17-IV-1199 the first expatriarts returned home.  They renamed the
planet Enkidu, to symbolize the hope they felt for the future. Right now
life is difficult; its not easy rebuilding a world, but by working togethor
the residents will build a new future.

HELP, I drew a total blank. I am sure someone out there can come up
with a good idea.

Fija  D553754-A

          Government: Feudal Technocracy        Law Level: Moderate
          Tech Level: Early Stellar             Star port: Poor
         The people of Fija crave order.  They are uncomfortable with things
which do not follow detailed plans.  This enabled them to survive the Collapse
without the patterns of mass riotings, martial law, and mass executions which
many worlds suffered under.  The people simply refused to fall under the sway
of such chaos.  Fija was an original member of the Dawn League and
the earliest proponent for creating the Reformation Coalition.
Most residents feel that the RC has not gone far enough, too much is
still left to chance.
Without careful planning, many efforts will be wasted and lives will be
thrown away for little gain.  If the Coalition would restructure itself, it
could apply precious resources for maximum gain.
        The governing of Fija is divided up into small bureaus each charged
with a specific task.  Each bureau is run by a different group of technocrats.
The bureaus come under review each ten years.  At this time any group can
bid for control of the bureau.  The selection is decided by an impartial
group of judges.  A great deal of political intrigue surrounds the
selection process.

Helios E648243-4
          Size: Large : D=9600km                Atmosphere: Thin Tainted

          Tech Level: 4 (Circa 1900)            Star port: Frontier
        Oriflamme originally claimed this world as its own.  The Oriflamme
technarchs dispatched a ship, to assess the natural resources and the remnants
of its technology.  The survey was going well, and the planet showed
considerable untapped potential, when the crew discovered a small
village on one of the southern islands. The technarchs debated whether
they could get away with
destroying the village and claiming the planet as unihabited, but the news
was leaked to CIN, before a decision could be made.  The RCES quickly contacted
the village.  The village welcomed the visitors from the stars and after a few
short months, asked to be admitted to the Coalition.  Since then the residents
of Helios have become a fervent supporter of the Federalists in the Assembly.
They have also tried to be a burr in the side of the Oriflamme technarchs. Often
voting against a bill, simply because Oriflamme supports it.
        The people of Helios are very simple folk.  They have achieved a
low level of technology, but are happy with it.  Most other worlds in the
Coalition are trying to raise their Tech Level as high as possible as fast
as possible.  Thr residents of Helios would rather go out into the Wilds
and help uplift the people who are suffering under the heels of TEDs and
religious dictatorships.

Kruyter B000312-B
          Size: Asteroid Belt                   Atmosphere: None
          Hydrographics: None                   Population: 3000
          Government: Corporate                 Law Level: Low
          Tech Level: B (Avg Stellar)           Star port: Good
        Kruyter was a minor crossroad in the pre-war era, not even important
enough to attack. It emerged from the Final War unscathed, but Virus changed
that.  Virus scoured all life from the system.  The system
was left untouched by human hands for seventy years.  In 1200, Kruytercorp
was formed to bring life to the system.  The corporation was privately funded,
one of the first corporations with a stock offering on the new RC wide stock
exchange. The RC is the major stockholder, other stockholders include Transstar,
and Glanow Trust on Oriflamme, and Meldarr Holding.
        Kruytercorp has rebuilt the starport and it is a a major stopover
for ships travelling from Aubaine subsector to Oriflamme subsector.  It
also has many prospectors searching the asteroid belt for valuable minerals and
for relic technology.  So far the search has gone badly.  Kruytercorp has
spent a great deal of capital on rebuilding the starport, so far this
has not shown a profit, and the prospecting division is hemoraging red ink
badly.
        The prospectors are a very eclectic group of individuals.  They were
drawn from every Coalition world, and possess a vast array of beliefs, values
and ideas on how the future should unfold.  There has been some talk of what
to do if Kruytercorp goes under, but so far the prospectors are undecided.

Lucifer D474784-8

          Tech Level: 8 (Circa 1990)            Star port: Poor
        Before the Final War Luhtala, as it was then called, was home to
millions of anarchists and mystics.  During the collapse, the Luhtalans were
forced to create a minimal amount of government to deal with the destruction of
the interstellar infrastructure.  Many of the anarchists were upset about
this, but they were persuaded before the argument became violent. Many did
not pay much attention to the government after it was formed, and let it
go about its business in peace.  It keeps society running, and doesn\'t
interfere with the day to day life of most residents.  After being
contacted by the emerging Dawn League, Luhtala petitioned to join, and
changed its name to Lucifer.
        The residents of Lucifer, who are still called Luhtalans, have
a wild streak. They are still reluctant to follow orders from governments or
anyone for that matter.  There are still thousands of cults and mystic
religons active on the planet. Now that interstellare travel has been restarted
many of these have started to recruit members across the Coalition and beyond.

Nike Nimbus C447789-9

          Tech Level: 9 (Early Stellar)         Star port: Routine
        In antebellum times, the world of Hite, was ruled by a dictator
by the name of Crystal DeAmberville.  Hite was hit hard by the Final War,
and then even worse by Virus.  As the ruins of the capital lay burning, a
mob broke into the presidental palace and tore DeAmberville to pieces.
Many things can be said of DeAmberville, but one thing is for sure, she
created a massive high quality bureaucracy to carry out her orders.
After her death, the bureaucracy continued to function.  As it was one
of the few remaining institutions on the planet, it was able to organize
food shipments and begin to rebuild the planet.
        In 1195 Hivers came to the planet and found a planet still
struggling with the rebuilding effort. The planet became a member of
the new Dawn League and after a planet wide contest changed its name
to Nike Nimbus, after an ancient Terran goddess of victory.
        The Nimbians feel strongly that the most important thing about
the Coalition is that it is rebuilding civilization.  The petty political
arguments of the Assembly of Worlds don\'t help anyone.  Even though
their planet is still trying to rebuild, the Nimbians have formed several
corporations to go out into the Wilds and help rebuild civilization.

Oriflamme B846857-9
          Size: Large : D=12,800km              Atmosphere: Thin Tainted

          Tech Level: 9 (Circa 2010)            Star port: Good
        Before the Collapse over seven billion people lived on Oriflamme.
A vast network of robotic farms fed the masses.  When Virus struck, it
possessed thousands of these farms, and turned the robotic workers into
roving death machines.  Hundreds of millions died by the hands of these
robotic killing machines.  Even more died of starvation, in the next few
years, as people struggled to produce food, with primitive non-mechanical
means.  It wasn\'t just people who died, the basic trust in your fellow man
died, compassion, charity and kindness all died.  When it was a choice between
feeding your child, or a stranger, the stranger went hungry.
        The situation on Oriflamme began to turn around, in late 1165,
when the first of the Technarchs emerged.  They promised to feed those
who would swear alliegence to them.  They than began to secure other
basic industries, until they controlled the entire planet.
        The scars of the collapse are still on the psyche of the residents
of Oriflamme.  Life is cheap on Oriflamme, and only those who are
strong survive. Oriflamme is very interested in expanding the Coalition, but
under Oriflamme control.

Phoebus  D267337-3

          Tech Level: 3 (Circa 1800)            Star port: Poor
NOTE:There seems to be some question of whether Phoebus is a full
member of the Coalition or not. On page 15 of POT, it says "... and there is
growing pressure from the populatioin to admit the planet as a member of the
Coaltion."  But on page 17 they are listed as having a vote in the Assembly.

        Fuetz, like many low population worlds in the Imperium was
dependent on the outside for most goods.  When interstellar trade stopped
the economy on Fuetz collapsed.  Most of the high tech machinery on the
planet was dependent on spare parts produced on other worlds.  Without  the
support of a interstellar high tech infrastructure, the supportable
tech level plummeted.  Sustainable technology went from Average Stellar
to the early Industrial Age.  Transportation went from grav cars to
animal drawn carts.  Since being recontacted by the Dawn League, several
bootstrap missions have been launched to help raise the sustainable
tech level, but it is slow going.
        Upon being admitted to the RC, Fuetz like many other worlds, changed
its name to symbolize the hope that the RC brings.  The planet is ruled
by the Council of Citizens.  The Council is elected from all citizens, but
only 10% of the population are citizens.  Citizenship is given to children
of Citizens, but both parents must be citizens.  The Council can also
nominate indiviudals for citizenship, but this is rarely done. Usually
only for those noncitizens who do the Council a great service.
Most non-citizens don\'t mind this setup, life is difficult, and they
don\'t have time to bother with politics.  Also the Council doesn\'t actually
do that much.

        Before the Final War Ra was the home to only 60 people, all members
of the Striench family.  During the later parts of the war, the world
was swamped with refugees from doomed and failing worlds.  The refugees
threatened to overwhelm the Striench family.  The Strienchs hired a
mercenary force to act
as a police force and hired a company from Keipes to manage the refugees.
After the Virus cut off the planet from the outside universe, the Strienchs
allowed the stranded company to tax the refugees enough to pay for the
government.  The company has slowly evolved into a true government, but
one that is almost totally unresponsive to the will of the people.

        The original population of Rohit died off sometime during the Collapse.
It has been resettled by the Children of Tomorrow, a religious group from
Lucifer.  The Children follow a strict doctrine, that expouses self denial
and believes that physical labor is the way to achieve spiritual purity.
They felt the lifestyle on Lucifer was incompatiable with their goals and
decided to emmigrate.  They secured permission to colonize the planet
from the Dawn League and began to rebuild the planet\'s life support system.
They have rebuilt a city that is located in an underground cavern system.
They welcome visitors, but most outsiders find the planet too austere.
The Assembly of Worlds allows them to send a non-voting represenitive to the
Assembly.  The Children are pressuring to be admitted as a full member
world.

        Thousands of Schalli were brought to Schall in Imperial times, to
study them away from their native home on Vras (Aubaine).  During the Collapse
the native humans learned that the Schalli were truly intelligent.  The
Schalli helped the humans survive, but were not interested in getting more
involved with human society. The Schalli on Aubani are very interested
in going out into the stars, while those on Schall tend to be very conservative 
and
traditional.  Not many Schalli from Schall have joined interstellar
society. Many Coalition residents, especially those from Lucifer come
to Schalli to experience the Schalli culture in its pure unspoiled state.
        The government is the only Feudal Technocracy that is in the Federalist
camp.  The people like their government, but don\'t believe that it is would
be best for everyone.  Every world is different and should come up with a
system that works for that world.

        Shenadoah weathered the Collapse rather well.  It didn\'t
suffer a major population die off, the economy was the only thing that was
heavily damaged.  The sustainable technology level fell to 5, but
recent work has raised it to 6.  The citizens are very friendly and take
a great deal of pride in being a member of the Coalition.  Many young
people have joined the RCES and the RCN.  Almost all residents
try to be involved in their community, many spend their free time reading
up on planetary and RC politics and policies.  One of the most popular
activities is arguing about politics.

        Spencer is only the second world to be forcibly integrated into
the Coalition.  Oriflamme signed a mutual security agreement with a small
nation in the Southern chain of islands in 1198.  Over the last three years
Oriflamme built up its strenth. In late 1201 they launched a suprise
attack against the other nations on the planet.  Within three months
they had defeated all large military units on the planet.  Since then
they have been conducting mop up operations. Casulaties have been heavy,
a suprisingly strong resistance movement has sprung up.  They are well

that the rebels are getting off planet help.

Spires  E894789-2
          Size: Large : D=12,800km              Atmosphere: Dense Tainted

          Tech Level: 2 (Circa 1600)            Star port:  Frontier
        During the Third Imperium this was a  primitive world placed under
Imperial interdict as an anthropological laboratory for observation of, and
controlled  experiments on, social development. Lacking fossil fuels or
significant surface deposits of useful metals, technological development
stalled  fairly early, but philosophy and the arts flourished.  Since contact
by the Dawn League, a bootstrap campaign has been under way to raise
the worlds\'s tech level using solar power and imported metal or synthetic
materials.  Spires\' citizens interested in starfaring are encouraged to
attend off world academies, and have done so in large numbers, but Spires
iteself still remains a simple and largely pastoral world.

Trybec B443610-A
          Size: Small : D=4000km                Atmosphere: Thin Tainted

          Tech Level: A (Early Stellar)         Star port: Good
        Trybecorp LIC has owned Trybec since 503, when Trybecorp bought
the planet from a destitute noble family, and then renamed the planet
after itself.Trybecorp was a minor corporation in the Imperium, never
near megacorporation status, its influence extended over most of
Diaspora and the Old Expanses.  Trybecorp\'s major products include
computer hardware, grav vehicles, farm equipment and heavy factory
machinery.  The company used Trybec as a manufacturing center and also
as a profit making enterprise in its own.
        The Collapse crippled Trybecorp, cutting it off from its suppliers
and markets.  Also large elements of the corporation were destroyed in
the Final War and during the collapse.  Since the founding of the Dawn
League, Trybecorp has been very interested in expanding civilization.
It funded the construction of Dawn Base, funded halfof the Dawn League
Scouts and urged the creation and expansion of the RCES. When the
Twelve were lost, it was a terrible blow to the citizens of Trybec, but
they have resolved to struggle on.

          Tech Level: 7 (Circa 1970)            Star port:Poor
        Vezina was the first world to be conqured by the Coalition.  The
actual conquest was quite by accident.  The largest TED on the planet
seized the Aurora, one of the Twelve.   In 1199 the Lirgishkhunan and the
Ashtabula launched a rescue raid which inadverently toppled the government.
After this the other TEDs on the planet surrendered.
        The RC has placed a group of RCSA officials in charge of the planet
Several bootstrap missions are in place, and a great deal of relic
technology is being recovered.  The people of Vezina are generally happy
with the conquest, the TEDs were not popular, and the RC is improving living
conditions immensly.  A few primitive neo-tribal societies are resisting the
Coalition, they are proving more a nuisance, than a threat.

        Zloga is yet another boneyard world, the Final War destroyed
its life support systems.  Zloga was actually named Saloga before the
Collapse, but tech prospectors returning to the world misread the
original name, and it has since been known as Zloga.  There is a small
community of tech prospectors on the planet.   They have a small
habitat, from which they make forays into the dead cities.  Any
issues effecting the community is decided by a vote of all residents
over the age 14.

The most *obvious* answer would be to tie it in with the boardgame
of the same name, which describes the Nebula as:

 \'a cluster of systems connected by uncharted jump routes. This
area of space has not been fully explored and (at the beginning of
the game) constitutes an area avoided because of the difficulty of
travel within its borders.\'

Players could send their exploration ships \'seek out new worlds\'
in the Nebula\'s part of the board, which would allow them to role
on the Exploration Table. Possible results were awards of resource
points, and scientific breakthroughs that gave ships advantageous
DMs in combat or greater jump range.

"greatly reducing" ???  the only difference is a -1DM for _passive_

Sensor wise it is useless, IMO.  There isn\'t any sense in not having a

turn it on if it isn\'t there.

Perhaps. But that cuts both ways. And why the baby boom at the end of the war?
All those guys coming home? *AND* "Rosier the Riveter" being given the boot so
that those guys could have their old jobs back. And didn\'t many women just
*love* that. Which is why we have the women\'s lib movements and the declining
birthrates now.

I still do not see that, given the costs, a very large population could have
been dumped offworld, and all of those from low birthrate countries. What you
dump there comes off Terra\'s max pop, doesn\'t add to it. Even allowing for
the fact that pioneers *may* want bigger families (and that\'s am unproven and
dubious assertion given that we are *not* talking women for whom the only
career is having some man\'s babies! This is the *future*), this probably means
only a modest population growth figure.

Well, yes, you *could*. And Kibbutzes are *really* popular in the US? They
don\'t even seem to be popular in Israel ... the population is greying as kids
move off to the bright lights. They never attracted everyone anyway. They have
never been popular anywhere else in the western industrialised world either.
Its a bid ask for such a massive anti-individualistic change to occure -- and
amongst the sort of people most reknowned for their individualism, *pioneers*,
too!

But is it "conservative" to have the population double every 100 years when
the currently available figures say that it will *PEAK* early next century at
11 billion, and then decline. No, I\'d say that\'s *anything BUT* conservative.

Yes, and I can see that the Vilani would *never* think of lying to the
administrator, or *disappearing* him and his troops with their own planetary
forces! Never in a million years! Rubbish. Of course they would be tempted to
do just that ... and the chance of retribution would be relatively small. In
any case, there is likely to be guerilla ops and the Vilani authorities are
more likely to be pro-guerilla, or at least anti-terran, than they are to be
pro-terran. After all, you never know when the thousand year reich ... er,
empire ... is coming back, do you?

typical militarist claptrap (in my conspiracy mode here!)! The Terrans wanted
to rule the Vilani Empire ... "[Estigarribia] realised that the Confederation
Government could not possibly control the vast territories of the Vilani
Imperium ..." (Imp Encyc pg. 36) ... and Hiroshi, like a typical "jerk on
horseback" believed that only *he* was qualified to do it. Sound like half the
petty dictators in Africa, Asia, and South and Central America justifying the
overthrow of a democratic government? Sure does to me! And, after all, that\'s
what my "conspiracy theory" states was actually the case ... and the evidence
certainly *can* be read that way!

Er, no, sorry. You\'re wrong! ImpEncyc Pg. 36 (again) ... "Nearly all the fleet
sided with E both because it was composed largely of colonials, who were
under-represented under the Terran Confederation Government, and because of E\'s
careful preparation. The Confederation was dissolved without significant
resistance."

It does *not* state that he had the approval of a majority of the Terran
Confederation, merely that the Fleet supported him (and we only have the
Imperium\'s word for the claim that "nearly all" supported him ... he could
just as easily have spread loyalist forces thin to occupy the Ziru Sirka and
left his own (dis)loyal forces where he could use them to stage the coup. This
is classic coup tactics.). It also doesn\'t say that the colonials were the
majority of the Terran Confed\'s population -- merely that they were
under-represented (and this could as easily be his "black" propaganda again)
in the government. Maybe they only had 10% of the reps when they sould have
had 11%? It doesn\'t say they should have had 51% ... and whose word do we have
for the "fact" that the colonials "all" supported him. In politics it is
unusual for "all" of any group to support *anything* ... again, this could
easily be post-coup black propaganda. As for the rest of the TC\'s pop, there
is no indication that they supported him -- or were even given a chance to
express an opinion, as, after all, he dissolved it! And the "lack of
*significant* resistance" ... well, these are military-political weasel words
of the highest order! And, again, given that he planned this coup in advance,
he easily moved all loyal TC forces to where they could be defeated piecemeal
by his disloyal forces and their vilani partners in treason! A complete
"canon" explanation!

First of all Subs are probably the best real world metatphor to use as
surface ships still have deck area where the crew can go out and look at the
sun, wind and waves.  Also in your missle patrol boat, how long continuous
did you stay at sea?  It is true that military often scrimps a the expense
of the crew, especially on non-nuclear subs.  The ULA is a Diesel-Electric
if I am not mistaken, and like most of her type crams about 80 crew into a
tube about 200 ft by 16 ft.  Most of that space is taken up by machinery and
the crew is squeezed in wherever that can fit themselves.  In between
torpedoes etc.  If the cruise is going to be fairly short (in WWII german
subs went out for 3 months)  In traveller this would be about 1 week, then
those crew accomodations would work but only for military vessels where the
crew is subject to strict discipline.  In a commercial or civilian vessel
the crew and passengers would never stand for it.  A US or Russian boomer
might be the best example of what a traveller startship is like.  It has a
large space alloted to containerized cargo (the nukes), a large high-tech
engineering section.  The big diff would be that crew req. for a traveller
ship of the same size are much smaller allowing more space per person.
besides even on a nuke, there is a fairly large common area (the Russian
Typhoon class even has a swimming pool in it!)

I guess the thing to remember is that people get used to what is allotted to
them, and they will expand or contract to fit the space allotted. =20

Status: RO

Lewis,

Here\'s my Baldur summary:



Baldur\'s government, though classed as a Feudal Technocracy, could be better
classed as just a Technocracy.

The Council of Science runs all of Baldur\'s resources vital to Baldur\'s
development. A democratically elected assembly runs non-essential aspects
of planetary life, such as Tourism (;-) , Law Enforcement, etc. The assembly
can also raise points to be discussed by the Council of Science.

Many of L\'Steich\'s Corporations survive in some form on Baldur. The largest
is the Hellenic Trade and Transport Corporation, which controls a large
slice of Baldur\'s merchant fleet. Ships include 2x 20,000 ton colonizer vessels
some Tukera Freighters, Frontier Transports, Bulk Carriers, and many Liners,
Subsidized Merchants, and Far Traders. Many ships were rated for J-3 and J-2
as it is impossible to make the Journey from L\'Steich to it\'s former colonies
of Bestor and Baldur in a J-1 vessel (unless you want to arrive with little
maneuvering juice).

Baldur has access to a large number of vessels due to the fact that both it
and L\'Steich had time to prepare for the onset of the virus. Many on L\'Steich
evacuated to it\'s lower tech colony world when it became obvious that L\'Steich
couldn\'t survive. Many evacuation ships didn\'t arrive, many that did limped
into orbit, some could be brought up to operating standards and are used by
Baldur today. Those that couldn\'t sit in the Mothball fleet, just above
Geostationary orbit - most gutted by the Proctors for equipment to keep
Baldur alive through the collapse.

Their Starport is impressive. Though only C-Class, it had to handle the
colonists who arrived in droves from L\'Steich every year, and service the
vessels they came on. Half-Starport, half-colony, it\'s accomodations were
huge, designed to accomodate 100,000 people, and originally built at TL-9, it
was sufficiently primitive enough to survive the collapse.

RC politics. Though Centrist, and a close ally of Oriflamme, the Baldur govt is
becoming increasingly estranged from Oriflamme. They suspect their Technarchs
are bypassing the Auction, and denying them the equipment their planet needs to
survive and prosper. They are also angry at the way Oriflamme is treating their
Colony on Poyzen as a dumping ground for Oriflammen malcontents. Deep down they
despise the Technarchs, the Council of Science runs Baldur in order to
survive -
unlike their Oriflammen counterparts who enrich themselves at their planet\'s
expense.
If the Council can get evidence of Oriflamme breaching the Auction, they intend
to use it as a lever to get Oriflamme to support the upgrading of their
starport to B-class, as they fear a loss in Auction trade when Oriflamme\'s port
reaches A-class and Nike Nimbus\'s port reaches B-class.
They hope their colony on Poyzen will be sucessful, and that trade down through
L\'Steich to Poyzen will eventually make it economic to re-develop their
homeworld, which they consider Bladur territory, along with Bestor.



Here\'s Tiger\'s comments:

>Overall, I like it.  I was wondering about the ships the Baldur has.  Where
>did they come from and how long have they been in service.  There wans\'t
>much travel between the stars after Virus hit (D&D Corp had only two or
>three ships, and they were only available for part of the 70 "dead" years).
>I am assuming that they were either stranded at L\'Steich after Virus hit and

>weren\'t available for their repair until recontact occurred.

Most of the ships came from L\'Steich when it became obvious that would couldn\'t
survive. Most were incapacitated in one way or another, many were raided
during the past 70 year for parts to keep Baldur running.


Let us know what you think, I\'ll try and get most of the rest of my Baldur
stuff into a computer soon.

All the best,

Eamon.

Hi Lewis,

phew! You\'ve been busy! I\'ve got about 20 pages done on Baldur, but
still lots to type into the computer. I sent tiger a summary of my work on
Baldur - I\'ll mail that after these thoughts on your RC list.


Looks good, here\'s the worlds I\'ve comments on.

Good, but references in "The Death of Wisdom" suggest that Aubaine also has
some form of Constitutional Monarchy (Nobles still active).

My own take on Baldur is a bit different. Baldur is a primordial world, little
free oxygen in the atmosphere, and ash filled due to Volcanic activity. The
Sea I think can\'t be acid - I don\'t think TL-9 (Or even their original TL-11)
could produce buildings (esp. seals) that could cope. Baldur\'s sea in mine
has volcanic byproducts dissolved and in suspension in it, making it
\'poisonous\' H2O. Remember the Shalli help out there - I think H2SO4 or
whatever would be unfeasible for even TL-12 to deal with economically.
My summary on Baldur will follow.



>Enkidu E510415-9

I had Enkidu\'s corporations being from L\'Steich, the Planet that colonized
Baldur. It seemed to be a bit of a power in the Pre-Collapse Imperium, so I
assumed that the Baldur-Meadsk main was heavily influenced by them.

I\'ll give it a try - can\'t promise anything.

Good. I submitted to the list a while back that after the virus attack on
Nike Nimbus Kruytercorp might start specializing in SDB\'s - maybe transported
to their buyers by Transtar\'s Dawn Clippers?

Ra was another of the L\'Steich influenced worlds in my take. Many refugees from
L\'Steich fled to Baldur, some got as far as Ra.

Someone in the last digest asked if sleeping in a low berth would leave
you rested when you woke up.  I would say the answer was a definate no.
According to CT/MT rules, low berths are actually quite taxing on the
system and require a survival roll when one wakes up in one (so you
wouldn\'t last long sleeping in one on a regular basis).  Also, if one
assumes that a low berth halts all physiological activity, then you would
be halting a number of physiological processes (metabolization of fatigue
poisons, REM sleep, etc.) necessary for a good night\'s rest.  The "Micheal
Jackson" technique would not work, IMHO.

I never got the novels, I was waiting until the entire trilogy came
out. Can someone who has them, write up a paragraph on the government,
or just tell me what the relevant passeges are.
Is there any other infomation in the books that would be useful?


>Baldur CAAA756-9

>My own take on Baldur is a bit different.
That great, I knew you were writing up Baldur, so I didn\'t invest much time in 
it.

In Eamon\'s Baldur Summary:
>Though Centrist, and a close ally of Oriflamme, the Baldur govt is
>becoming increasingly estranged from Oriflamme.They suspect their Technarchs
>are bypassing the Auction, and denying them the equipment their planet needs to

I always thought that was just a few renegade technarchs. Becuase if
they avoid the auction at Oriflamme, it cuts into the Oriflamme economy
also.  I was thinking of an adventure that had something to do with
this. If I ever flesh it out, I\'ll post it.

I think we can incorporate that.  Hmmmm.  How about the corporations
were founded by L\'Steich  residents. The corporations\' major market was
L\'Steich and the associated worlds such as Baldur.  How about instead
of fleeing to Nike Nimbus they fled to Ra, POT says Ra is populated with 
refugees.


>>Ra E68659A-6
>Ra was another of the L\'Steich influenced worlds in my take. Many refugees from
>L\'Steich fled to Baldur, some got as far as Ra.
That works too. I think Ra should have several groups of Refugees, it
seems very cosmopoliton. A bunch from L\'Steich and more from Enkidu and
probably some from
a few worlds that are still dead. Maybe from Thoenzant subsector, just
over the border.

Also I think I\'ll change the name of the family that lived on Ra,
Striench its too close to L\'Steich.  I\'ll figure it out later.

>Good. I submitted to the list a while back that after the virus attack on

Steve Bonneville did an estimate of the capacity of various A & B
shipyards in the RC, it got posted to the TML a while ago:

>Shipbuilding and overhaul capacity:
>  Aubaine         960,000                   tech-12 class-A
>  Oriflamme     1,120,000                   tech-9  class-B
>  Aurora            8,400 (O:RCN)           tech-11 class-B
>  Trybec            8,400 (O:RCES)          tech-10 class-B
>  Kruyter               4 (O:Kruytercorp)   tech-11 class-B

That\'s in tons, so Kruyter doesn\'t have much shipbuilding capacity.  I
think the capacity is based on population, and Kruyter doesn\'t have
much of a population.  But it is heavily funded by outside sources, so
it probably has some repair facilities, but no building capacities.



>Spires  E894789-2
I wonder if there are many Psions on Spires?
Probably.
The world that would have lots of of Psions, is Lucifer, with all those
crackpot mystics, wierd cults and other strangness, Psions fit right in.

Yeah, but the AHL isn\'t a good model since it\'s not a good ship :-)
Take some TCS designed squadrons on.  Or just think----if only tankers
are vulnerable, and they get killed easily, there will be no tankers.

Yes, true; but if my memory of documentaries about Typhoon class boomers is
correct, we\'re talking about a pool the size of a spa pool ( but twice as deep
). You could probably fit six to eight good friends in it ( standing up ). I
mention this because the phrase "swimming pool" conjours up visions of a 50
metre olympic size pool with full landscaped surrounds, and deck chairs
scattered around, and ( if memory serves ) I believe the Typhoons pool is housed
in what might be described as a small steel bathroom. :-)

Yes. This was the reason I embarked upon this project in the first place. UPPs
seemed so cold, and also difficult to use unless you had memorised all the world
creation tables.

For those who need a status report at present, I have just finished redesigning
the data structures ( to cope with the large number of ideas furnished by TML
readers ) and have begun redesigning the interface to cope with this. Those who
were hoping for a display of the inner system of a hex will be disapointed to
learn that this proved to be to difficult to achieve at this point, primarily
because I couldn\'t come up with an acceptable data structure to house the
information required to draw it. I did try ( pouring through the Scouts book ),
but found the task too complex to attempt at present.

If someone else (with lots of experience in designing solar systems ) is
interested in putting together a data structure which works for ALL cases, then
I\'d love to hear from them. This data structure should be as normalised as is
practical for relational use ( and if you don\'t understand what I mean by this,
then you don\'t have the knowledge to do the job - sorry ).

Failing this, perhaps one of the chaps writing sector generators may have an
idea or two about this.

Otherwise, I\'ll revisit the topic when the initial version is stable, and
everyone is happy with it.

On a similar subject, there was a recent TV series about the history of
submarines. In the last episode, they asked a British SSBN captain how the
crew passed the time on patrol - apparently, his boat has a model railway
set up in the missile room, with the track running round the launch tubes!
Another has a Scalextric set, and I forget what the others have. Could be
nice and confusing for PCs to find something similar on an old SDB...

OK, OK, my memory of this comes from the Discovery documentary called Steel
Sharks.  The biggest thing I remember was that although the swimming plool
was small (it was more like a hot tub), it was in a room that looked about
50ft long by 20 feet wide that was two stories high.  It had lots of workout
equipment, and was basically the gymnasium.  The Typhoon is the largest sub
ever built, and although it crams the crew in tight, it also has the best
rec facilities ever on a sub.

The Ohio class boomer by contrast ia smaller, and allots about the same bunk
space per crewmember.  The US goes in for high tech entertainment instead of
a gym etc.  They provide movies, video games, etc.  Still these ships are
similar in size to say a Destroyer or Light Cruiser in Traveller terms.
When you have 100 crewmembers, it is probably a good idea to install bunks
and cam the crew in, then use communal rec facilities.

Once again the problem arises in small ships.  I still feel that there
should be a little bit of space alloted to recreation on even say a far
trader.  Maybe just 5 DTons.  That would allow for a small weight room, or a
galley, or a multipurpose room.  Luxury ships would definately require LOTS
of space for recreation.  This would account for the ticket price of
10,000Cr plus.  I still think that this is a number pulled out of the air as
it costs a pilot over 1 months salary to purchase a ticket to the next
system. (Base salary what 6,000Cr/month.)  The problem here once again is
who the heck can afford to travel?  Any ideas, I certainly would like to
know!!!!

Sure, but didn\'t your mom tell you that you should never listen to strange

Oh, and Aussie assault laws (the ones that apply in NSW, anyway) are similar to

  IMO, Fire, Fusion and Steel was one of the best game supplements to be

relatively consistent method of designing just about any technological item
for Traveller.  However, like any other supplement, it has its problems.
  One of the most glaring errors is in the area of laser weapons.  While
they got a few things right, and it can be argued that the design rules for
heavy lasers is reasonably accurate, some of the methods covering small
arms and heavy weapons lasers are, for the most part, dead wrong.  I\'ll try
to address my arguments against (or in favor of) each particular section as
I present my latest treatise on...


Small Arms Lasers

  Disclaimer:  I\'ve decided to concentrate on CLC lasers of TL-11+, as I
never did have the patience to try and figure out the DEI laser design
sequence.  If anyone has helpful advice or suggestions, I\'d appreciate
them.


1.  Tech Level
        The tech level at which the laser is built affects all its major
components and functions - the size and mass of its Lasing Assembly, the
wavelength of light that can be produced, the mass of its power supply, and
in the case of chemical lasers, the mass of its fuel cartridges and
reaction chamber.  When a small arms laser is being designed, the builder
must also designate whether the laser is tunable or fixed wavelength, and
if it is pulsed or continuous wave.
        Tunable lasers appear at TL7, with the introduction of dye lasers.
These are primitive, however, and require 1 hour of maintenance per kg of
Lasing Assembly to change the frequency of the laser, and a
Difficult:Electronics task.  Dye lasers are also limited in power; they are
incapable of producing more than 5000 Kj (0.005Mj).  Free-electron lasers
appear in late TL9, and are tunable down to UV wavelengths.  The
development of chemical lasers at TL11 enables each laser to be "tuned" to
multiple wavelengths by simply changing the ammunition.  The reaction
chamber must be "dry-fired" using an inert cleaning solution before
changing the chemicals, requiring only a few seconds.
        All small arms lasers (and mounted squad support lasers) are
assumed to be pulsed, firing bursts of light of very short duration (0.01
to 0.001 second), delivering a lot of energy over a small area and causing
explosive vaporization damage.


2.  Gravitic Focusing
        What a cop-out this was!  None of the other energy weapons, not
particle accellerators, nor meson guns, have this option.  Why lasers?  In
my game I\'ve eliminated this ridiculous kludge; I recommend other do so as
well.  You end up with much more interesting and much less unrealistic
weapons.


3.  Lasing Assembly
 FFS has this one dead wrong.  The effectiveness of a laser is determined
by its length, not its diameter.  Small arms are usually made as compact as
possible, and this means one doesn\'t have the luxury of building a "Focal
Array" 5cm or more in diameter.
        Select the length of the lasing assembly (LA).  The longer the
Assembly, the tighter the beam can be focused.  The weapon\'s intended
function determines the length of the LA; the chart below lists typical
lengths.
        Weapon                LA length
        Snub/Holdout      5cm
        Pistol                       15cm
        Carbine              25cm
        Rifle                         35cm
        Sniper Rifle            50cm

        The weapon\'s effectiveness is determined by a combination of its
_lasing assembly length_ and _beam diameter_.  The beam diameter must be as
tight as possible for the weapon\'s power level in order to achieve the best
possible effective range.  Designers have little control over this.  The
beam diameter is determined by the following formula:

                        Bd =3D (E^(1/3))/pi
                        where:  E is Discharge Energy in joules
                                              pi is pi
                                              Bd is Beam Diameter, in
millimeters
      If you\'re wondering where I got the formula for this, or if you\'ve tri=
ed
      (and failed) to find it, don\'t bother.  It\'s kind of a derivative of
      the G3G laser Bd formula, but made a little less cumbersome.  It
      produces similar results, with a lot fewer keypresses on the calculato=
r.


4.  Discharge Energy
        Specify the amount of output energy that will be fired by the
laser, in megajoules (Mj).  The higher the discharge energy, the greater
the damage, and the more equipment is needed to support the laser and
supply the required energy.
        Once the discharge energy has been determined, calculate the volume
and mass of the Lasing Assembly.  The volume of the LA is equal to the
square of its beam diameter multiplied by =BC, and multiplied by its length,
discharge energy (in Mj) and its volume modifier from the table below.
                Vol=3D(Bd^2)x pi x L x Mj x Vm    in cubic centimeters (cc)
      Note:  Use the Beam diameter measurement in millimeters in the above
             formula.  I don\'t know why this works, but it does.

                Lasing Assembly Volume Multipliers
                TL                 Vm
                7-8               10
                9                                  5
                10-11            2
                12-15            1
                16-19            0.5
                20+                0.2

                Mass=3DVol                in grams (g)
                Price=3DVol                          in Credits (Cr)
     Note:  I\'ve tried to smooth the TL-related improvements in laser power-
                          to-mass ratios here.  It seems to produce better
results.

        Energy Efficiency and Input Power:  All lasers require a certain
amount of energy input to produce laser energy, defined as Input Energy
(IE), for each shot fired.  To find the amount of Input Energy required,
divide the pulse energy in Mj by the Energy Efficiency rating, calculated
below.

                Efficiency Rating=3D(TL-4) x 0.05 < 1.0

        No laser at any tech level may have an Efficiency rating higher
than 0.95.  Again, this is an attempt to smooth out the rate of
improvement.


5.  Laser Performance Rating
        A laser\'s performance is determined by multiplying its length (L)
by the range factor at the laser\'s tech level.  This is the laser\'s
effective range, the range at which it can most efficiently focus its
energy on a spot equal to its beam diameter.  Beyond this range, its power
level decreases due to beam divergence and diffraction.  Effective range is
measured in kilometers, and is not usually used in the short ranges of
personal combat.  It is, however, used to determine the damage inflicted by
the laser.

        Laser Range Factors
        TL         Range Factor/Wavelength of light             Code

centimeters by the range factor and dividing the total by 100.
                Er=3D(L x Rf)/100

        Use the atmospheric range modifier table on page 128 of FFS to
determine atmospheric performance.

Atmospheric Range Modifiers
Atmosphere                 VL and IR     UV and beyond

Thin (4, 5)                  0.2                      0.02
Standard (6, 7)   0.1                 0.01

Exotic (A+)                  0.01                    0.001

6.  Define Short Range
        The configuration of the weapon determines the actual short range.

                Short Range (meters) =3D 200 x Configuration Multiplier

                Configuration         Cm
                Snub                                 0.2
                Pistol                             0.4
                Bullpup                    0.9
                Two-Handed                      1.3
                Optic Sights (TL7)       1.05
                Optic Sights (TL8)       1.10
                Optic Sights (TL9+)     1.15

7.  Combat Ratings
        Small arms lasers have two combat ratings, range and damage.

        Combat Ranges:
                Short =3D Short range
                Medium =3D 2x Short range
                Long =3D 4x Short range
                Extreme =3D 8x Short range

        Damage:
        Calculate the beam\'s intensity  at each range using the following
formula.  The results are used to determine the damage level of the laser
at each range band.  If the laser is intended for selective pulse rates
(multiple pulses per charge), calculate intensity and damage levels for
each firing rate by dividing the intensity by the pulse rate.

                Intensity =3D DE (1/(R2))
                        R =3D (Range band value)/(Effective Range)
                        If R < 1, treat it as 1.

        Damage =3D 50 (=88I), drop fractions


Lasers with intensity levels above 1.5 may have penetration ratings.

        IPR =3D (=88I) x 0.8

        Penetration ratings are expressed as fractions; ie, an IPR of 3.4
rounds to 3, which is expressed as 1/3.


8.  Power Source:
        The CLC design systems in Fire, Fusion and Steel seemed to work
pretty well so I left it alone.


9.  Crew
        Man-portable small arms lasers automatically have a crew of one;
for these, this step is superfluous.  If a laser is tripod mounted, as in
support lasers, or vehicle mounted as in coaxial guns, a loader or gunner
position may be needed.


10.  Furnishings and Support Hardware
        Heavy weapons and small arms lasers, though usually man-portable,
may be equipped with tripods or bipods to assist in firing.  Firing from a
bipods increases the short range of a laser by 30%; firing from tripods
doubles it.
        Bipods mass 10% of the loaded mass of the weapon and cost Cr50 plus
ten times the bipod\'s mass (in kg) (50+[10Mb]).  The mass of a bipod is
included in the total mass of a laser.
        Tripods mass 50% of the loaded mass of the weapon and cost Cr100
plus ten times the tripod\'s mass (100+[10Mt]).  The tripod\'s mass is not
included in the total mass of the laser and should be listed seperately.

Cooling Systems:  No changes.

Small Arms Body:  No changes.

Weapon Length:  The following applies only to CLC weapons.
        To find the length of the weapon, add the length of its Lasing
Assembly and receiver.  Receiver length for CLC lasers depends on the type
of magazine it uses.  Receivers for grip magazines are 3x the length of the
CLC; for box or cassette magazines, add 150mm to the length of the CLC.
The housing of the weapon adds no significant length, nor does the Reaction
chamber, as it is assumed to be equal in length to the Lasing Assembly.
 The length of the weapon is equal to the combined lengths of its Lasing
Assembly, receiver and any accessories.

Accessories:  No changes.

Physical Characteristics:  No changes.  Well, one.  When describing the CLC
cartridge, list the tech level and wavelength code with it.  Effective
ranges may also be calculated for each wavelength the laser is capable of
using, if you want to.

Is\'nt this one of the great things about this SF-RPG? I mean, it is not
stuck in one genera(?) like StarWars or StarTrek. If a ref wants the
players to meet Cpt. Kirk, then they can. There could also be a meeting
between the aforementioned Cpt. Kirk, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and anyone
else for that matter. In fact, there could be a
resturant-and-the-end-of-the-universe thing where different universes meet
and people from ST, SW, Alien, Red Dwarf etc.

Just a thought.

You may be right. My recollection was that the gym and the pool were in

True. Imagine trying to look after a bunch of pampered, opinionated rich people
( nothing like a stereotype to get things going ) who are shut in a confined
space with only each other for company for a week ? No wonder you need to have a
trained steward on board whenever you carry passengers.

Good question. Although as far as the pilots salary bit is concerned, I can\'t
see this as any different than the situation of one of todays ships captains
trying to pay for a cruise on his luxury liner, or an airline pilot paying for a
first class ticket on the plane he flies. Anyway, "pilot"s will usually be in
the employment of the owner of the vessel, and won\'t need to think about paying.
 And within any Starship Line there would probably be a staff discount system
anyway.

I agree that the number was probably plucked out of the air, but it might be
possible to justify it by comparing the cost of transporting passengers vs cargo
at standard cargo rates ( taking into account the stewards required to keep them
happy, etc ). Any of you spreadsheet wiz-kids want to take a shot at this ?

Getting back to the price, and your final question : I guess only the well off
could afford to travel this way. Or those on large corporate expense accounts. I
suppose if you really want to know, drop in to the Concorde terminal in New York
sometime, and ask them :-)

In the old "Dumarest of Terra" books, which I think inspired large parts of
traveller (low passage for instance), High Passage included enough Slow (do
I have the speed right?) drug to spend he whole trip experiencing about one
minute per hour.  Made the steward\'s job a lot easier.

>Tunable lasers appear at TL7, with the introduction of dye lasers.
Dye lasers would make lousy weapons. They\'re notoriously tempermental,
limited in power, heavy, inefficient, and poorly adapted to ultra-high-energy/
ultra-low-pulserate...all to a degree that
would completely offset any benifit from being tunable in a weapon.
And I say that from here at LLNL, where probably the best dye lasers in the
world are made. They\'re great for some projects, where wavelength precision is
crucial...but would make lousy weapons lasers.

There\'s no particular reason for small-arms lasers to be tunable anyway.

TL7-8 small-arms lasers are almost certainly single-frequency solid-state
lasers.

Oh, and tuning a dye laser doesn\'t necessarily require a dye change - over
+-100 nm ranges or so you can keep using the same dye

These weapons will have effective ranges of much less than a BL hex, of course.
Effective traveler-canon space combat either needs gravitic focus, or
x-ray lasers, or multi-element synthetic aperture lasers (like a sensor
interferometer in reverse - lots of little lasers combining into one
big beam, with beam divergence set by the distance between the elements
but lousy efficiency because most of the power goes into sidelobes.)
Maybe they should have made x-ray lasers TL-9 instead...

Meson guns and particle accelerators don\'t need gravitic focus; meson gun
maximum range is limited by the meson lifetime, particle accelerators
by focusing rather than diffraction effects. Plasma/fusion weapons range
is limited by other problems.

This is just wrong. If a laser is diffraction-limited its beam divergence
is a function only of aperture; length doesn\'t enter into it (not
directly, anyway; at low tech levels, where the focal array is a telescope,
the bigger the focal array diameter the longer the telescope has to be
unless you spend more money on shorter focal-length optics...but that\'s
rather complicated.) No matter how long you make a laser you\'ll never
get beam divergence better than lambda/D. Ever.

I should note that I haven\'t tried the formulas in the article out - maybe
they produce beams that are much worse than the lambda/D diffraction
limit.

Small-arms lasers might not be diffraction limited, of course; the
atmosphere will probably set the beam size for UV lasers without fancy
adaptive optics, and optics quality may set the beam size for longer-wavelength
lasers.

One thing I would say about FFS is that it\'s probably too conservative
on chemical lasers tech level; the fist operational weapons laser, the
proposed USAF ABL, is probably going to be a chemical laser, operational
at TL8.

        This is way overstated, and any pilot who tried to do this should be
shot. The shuttle is a bad comparison.

        1. You don\'t have to start at 300km. The end of the "sensible"
atmosphere for Earth is considered to be somewhere around 120km.

        2. The shuttle does not drop vertically because it _cannot_. Why
should I follow the shuttle\'s flight path? It\'s an aerodynamic, unpowered
reentry vehicle, while I\'m in a high-tech powered contragrav gizmo.

        A more realistic scenario would be:
        - Start out in a 100km orbit that crosses my destination (say, White
Sands, NM)
        - Fire my engine to kill almost all my orbital velocity above White
Sands.
        - Since I\'m going to start dropping like a rock, I\'ll turn on my
Contra-Gravity.
        - Now I can control my speed using only my maneuvering thrusters.
        - At 100km/hr, I\'ll be on the ground in an hour. Add some extra time
to deal with winds, etc. at altitude (I need to match speeds more or less
with them). So 90 minutes to landing.

not refine fuel fast enought for the Scharhorst to keep up with an advancing
fleet.  Lastly, the Scharhorst must depend upon close escorts to screen out
enemy fighters and missiles, doto the Scharhorst light secondary armament.  Man

After the release of Virus in 1130 and in decade(?) that followed, There
seemed to be a greater concentration of Virus in and around the Core Sector.
Since the Collapse the so called "Free Trader Network" has delivered only
two pieces of information about this area known as the Black Curtain:  No
one knows what it contains, and no one that has ever entered there has
returned to tell about it.

The Black Curtain (along with the Empress Wave) was one of the key unknowns
about the TNE mileau.  My guess is that GDW was going to develop the Black
Curtain through adventures and manuals that were to be released in the
future.  Now, we may never know.

I think most speculation here on the mailing list has boiled down the Black
Curtain being to a Virus run interstellar society.  Similar to the Unity of
Promise on a Stellar scale.  My opinion is that this Black Curtain Society
is one of the major influences in reuniting the Regency and the RC on a
friendly scale.  In my estimation of the future:

  1202 - RC and REGENCY initiate major expansion programs.  (Known from POT &
                                                             Regency Sourcebook)
  1204 - RC allows Virus citizens.  (Known from Vampire Sourcebook)
  1206 - RC & REGENCY meet.  (Known from Vampire Sourcebook)
??1206 - RC & REGENCY begin War.  (My Guess)
??1207 - RC & REGENCY have first contact with Black Curtain Society
Exploration                 Vessels.  (My Guess)
??1208 - RC & REGENCY & Black Curtain Society wage three way war.  (My Guess)
??1209 - War Ravaged RC & REGENCY join forces to defeat Black Curtain
Society.                                  (My Guess)
??1211 - War ends.  Temporary and fragile truce signed between RC & Regency.
                                (My Guess)


My guess for the future also includes a resolution for the Empress wave and
recontact with the Solomani, Aslan, Vargr, etc.  I\'m working up the full
extension of the timeline.

Remember that the Imperium was very old and very stagnent.  Read 
Foundation if you haven\'t recently (I just finished it "again").  The 
Vilani empire had stopped advancing in technology and creativity some 
time ago.  How long were they stuck at TL 10?

It might have only required a push to knock them down.  How many 
high quality technicians did they have?  Were they able to properly 
repair the equipment they did have?  Were they able to produce new 
designs and integrate new technology quickly?  I think the assumption 
is NO!

Also, population is not neccessarily a measure of productivity.
Consider how Japan completely dominated high tech industry in only
40 years after being practically blasted back to the turn of the
century.   Also consider how the USSR - although certainly the same 
or nearly the same tech level as the US would never have been able to 
produce the same volume of high tech equipment as the Americans 
could.

This is mostly because smaller families are more ECONOMICALLY viable. 
 In a world with rising costs and inflation it makes more sense to 
have less children.

There could be dozens of colonies in just the first decade.  Small - 
1000 or 10,000 people on a world.  But consider how quickly the US 
grew from a colony to a dominant world power.

> In other words, the nations with the money and political clout to

(remember that the developing nations will have finished developing
by 2089.  The West won\'t be alone any more). 

But the colonies will provide several important things which MUST be
exploited by Earth especially in wartime, and a large population on
the colonies will be needed to produce them.  It\'s alot cheaper to
make babies than to ship out colonists. There will be a cultural and
economic pressure for those on the colonies to reproduce in droves.

1)  Minerals and materials.  Earth is near to exausting its supply 
of some critical raw materials.  There is no doubt that minerals in 
the rest of the solar system will someday have to be exploited.  
This will be especially true during Wartime.

2)  Industry.  Earth\'s industry will be turned to war - and colonies 
with mineral supplies will probably have factories built on them.  No 
point shipping iron to Earth if the colony can build the ships 
themselves.  Infact I imagine that in wartime, Earth will build alot 
of colonial shipyards - and take over alot of Vilani shipyards too.

This could help explain how the lowly colonies managed to overwhelm 
mother Earth in the end.

Actually,  by simply cutting off the supply of goods and materials to 
Earth the colonies could completely cripple her economy.  I imagine 
Earth will become very dependant on her colonies.  She will end up 
like the UK is today, a proud but feeble reflection of her former 
power.  Remember - England was the capital of the most powerful 
trading empire in the world.  Her fleets practically controlled the 
world\'s oceans at her height.  Within 200 years of her height - her 
colonies had surpassed anything she ever accomplished, and her fleet 
(though still strong) is only about the 4th or 5th largest in the 
world now.

But the women won\'t have any careers to go to.  They will work on the 
homestead beside their husband / partner - and naturally reproduce.  
There will be more economic incentive to have large families than to 
have small.  That is the driving force at work here - economics.  
Once the colony achieves a certain size - say 50 to 100 million -  then 
there will be a slowing of the population growth, especially in the 
cities.

	No one knows.  It is almost certainly virus related and may have 
something to do with the "Vampire Highway" that runs near RC space, but 
anyone who has gone to check it out has not come back.  My own theory is 
that it is a machine civilization which has lost its over-riding 
fascination with killing people and is now focused on organizing itself.  
Not to say that its not hostile, but the Virus there is busy doing other 
things at the moment.  It may be that it will emerge at some point to 
conquer the rest of known space, but for right now its just sitting tight.
	If I ever were to detail what lay behind the Black Curtain I\'d 
use Gregory Benford\'s "Galactic Core" series as my model.

	This exchange, coupled with the heavy cruiser design with the 
giant PAW posted to the same digest brought up a question I\'ve been 
wondering about for a while:  

	**Why is it possible to make PAWs that have vastly longer
	  effective ranges than non-grav-focused lasers? 

	From what I\'ve heard about proposals to use lasers or PAs to push 
interstellar spacecraft, the lasers can focus to longer ranges but 
deliver less energy.  In FF&S this is flipped around.  A PAW with a given 
diameter can hit a target much further out than a non-grav laser, until 
the introduction of x-ray lasers.  I suppose that since divergence in 
lasers is a fcn of lambda and the particles in PAs don\'t have a lambda, 
(that I know of) they\'re not subject to the same limits, but then I\'m 
just guessing.  Could someone with a better background than mine fill me in?
	Reply to the beta-list if you wish, or to me personally.  Thanks.

Yes. This was the reason I embarked upon this project in the first place. UPPs
seemed so cold, and also difficult to use unless you had memorised all the world
creation tables.
For those who need a status report at present, I have just finished redesigning
the data structures ( to cope with the large number of ideas furnished by TML
readers ) and have begun redesigning the interface to cope with this. Those who
were hoping for a display of the inner system of a hex will be disapointed to
learn that this proved to be to difficult to achieve at this point, primarily
because I couldn\'t come up with an acceptable data structure to house the
information required to draw it. I did try ( pouring through the Scouts book ),
but found the task too complex to attempt at present. 
If someone else (with lots of experience in designing solar systems ) is
interested in putting together a data structure which works for ALL cases, then
I\'d love to hear from them. This data structure should be as normalised as is
practical for relational use ( and if you don\'t understand what I mean by this,
then you don\'t have the knowledge to do the job - sorry ).
Failing this, perhaps one of the chaps writing sector generators may have an
idea or two about this.
Otherwise, I\'ll revisit the topic when the initial version is stable, and
everyone is happy with it.

My own take on Baldur is a bit different. Baldur is a primordial world, little
free oxygen in the atmosphere, and ash filled due to Volcanic activity. The
Sea I think can\'t be acid - I don\'t think TL-9 (Or even their original TL-11)
could produce buildings (esp. seals) that could cope. Baldur\'s sea in mine
has volcanic byproducts dissolved and in suspension in it, making it
\'poisonous\' H2O. Remember the Shalli help out there - I think H2SO4 or
whatever would be unfeasible for even TL-12 to deal with economically.
My summary on Baldur will follow.

I had Enkidu\'s corporations being from L\'Steich, the Planet that colonized
Baldur. It seemed to be a bit of a power in the Pre-Collapse Imperium, so I
assumed that the Baldur-Meadsk main was heavily influenced by them.

Yeah, but the AHL isn\'t a good model since it\'s not a good ship :-)
Take some TCS designed squadrons on.  Or just think----if only tankers

 Your suffering from the same problem as the regency, your rate of

 When one looks at Traveller interstellar commerce and diplomacy, one 
must think in terms of DECADES, and not months of years.

I actually wrote GDW a year or two ago with this same question.  The 
official answer was that the 1 hardpoint/100 tons limitation had been 
removed from the game.

I\'m looking forward to using your spreadsheet!

Support that one. An idea which I liked a Traveller GM not on this list 
put forward was the key to the Black Curtain was a virus infected ancient 
artifact. (Watch the player\'s panic when they understand it. ;) )

Now that is a "nice" coincidence. ("And it was in these days the Game

Personally I don\'t incorporate this one in my campaign. I think the 
collapse was too traumatic for a sufficient majority to accept virus 
citizens.

A bit fast, I think. Like everything in Traveller, so that isn\'t much of 
a problem. :)

I think they would have a resource and distance problem. And besides, 
wouldn\'t it be natural if RC met the Virus society first? (If the source 
books don\'t fit in, skip them. :) ) What reason has Regency to expand? My 
impression is that the Regency is rather isolationistic.

I support the idea of linking the Vampire Highway to the Core, fits 
nicely with a Black Curtain Virus Society. Recontacting the major races 
could be interesting campaign material.

	Ghod no!!! The foundations of both the RC and the Regency lie in
the horrific reality of the Rebellion, Hard Times and the
Collapse...there\'s no way they\'ll allow a repeat so quickly.
Relations may well be prickly, and occasional border clashes will
occur, but there is no way that a generalized war will break out,
the respective populations would never allow it.

	Secondly, the one absolutely sure thing that any schoolchild in 
either the Regency or the RC knows from history is that fighting 
three way wars are a certain route to disaster.  The Regency, at 
least, if they honor the legacy of Norris at all, will never lightly 
enter into another interstellar war with anything less than their 
very survival at stake. The RC simply can\'t afford one at all.

	The fragmentary quotes mentioned provide little basis for this timeline.  
Indeed, given the factious politics of both the Regency and the RC, 
all quotes could well be wrong, simply inflammatory rhetoric from the 
opposition.
 
	The RC and Regency need each other far more than they need to fight 
each other...there\'s an entire known universe to reclaim.  The RC has 
the experience with the Wilds that the Regency doesn\'t, and the 
Regency has the tech that the RC so desperately needs that it has to 
resort to Smash&Grab to get it.  I don\'t think for a moment that the leaders 
of either side are so stupid as to fight; they\'re all far too 
pragmatic for that.

	Virus as RC citizens? The Regency won\'t like it, and certainly will 
not allow them to enter the Regency, but that alone is not a reason 
for war.  Indeed, the Regency may well want to study them very 
closely, to ensure that the Regency is Virus-proofed by design rather 
than by Quarantine.

	As for the Black Curtain...the \'I am Lucan of Borg...prepare to be
assimilated\' scenario has always been a favorite of mine.  In fact,
the \'Lucan is God\' version of Virus on a general rimward course, as
described in the Vampire sourcebook, as well as the more advanced
Puppeteer strains, also coming from coreward do tend to support the
existence of a Virus dominated, if not exclusive, society.

	But the Regency and the RC need each other far too much on a
variety of levels...political, tactical, economic to ever go to a
generalized war, certainly not less than 100 years after the
rebellion and collapse. 

	Besides, dammit, the timlines are still way too compressed.  In
1202, the RC has barely moved outside it\'s borders, four or five
hexes at the most; by 1206 we\'re to believe that they\'ve crossed
entire SECTORS??? Under the best of times, time of flight from one
side of the Imperium to the other was on the order of what...six
months, using j4 x-boats, jumping continuously? Three years for the
usual ship traffic?  It\'s insane to believe that there was such an
incredible expansion is so little time.

	The only way for there to be such contact would be long range 
scouting missions...remember almost nothing is known about the 
intervening space between the RC and the Regency.

	Of course, the contact with each other will cause the respective 
scouts to burn jets getting home to spread the news, but meaningful 
contact via expansion has got to take place on a wider front, over a 
much longer period of time.  This becomes a question like how, 
exactly, did the heavily outnumbered Terrans take over the Vilani 
empire...except here\'s there\'s no meaningful number of subjects to 
help.

	At most there\'s a handful of pocket empires in there, each 
requiring negotiations to bring into either the fold of the RC or 
the Regency, or to negotiate independent existence...remember...not 
many people outside of the Regency have much taste for any flavor of 
imperial domination again.

	The Regency also is going to be facing expansionist pressures from 
the Aslan, from displaced Zhodanis, etc., so there\'s going to be a 
wide front of expansion, which will slow things down considerably.  
By the time that the RC and the Regency meet on terms that involve 
that wide front, they\'re going to be very different entities,and it\'s 
gotta be more like 25-50 years in the future.  They could KNOW about 
each other by 1206, but no way they\'re going to fight a war by 1206.

	Teaming up to take on whatever threat is coming from the core is
another matter entirely...but even that will be more like two widely
separated wars that happen to be going on at the same time.  If the
forces from the Black Curtain are at all powerful, the Regency will
not be able to do much more than offer moral support to the RC, and
certainly the RC won\'t have the resources to do squat to or for the
Regency.  If it comes to war between the Black Curtain and the RC,
it\'s going to be strictly desperation actions by the RC and the
Hivers...they haven\'t got anywhere near the resources to take on
anything more than isolated squadrons of ships, much less capital
fleets.  

	Look at the timelines for the Yards at Aubaine,  they have a backlog 
of something like 10 ships, and by 1202 are the ONLY class A 
shipyard. The RC doesn\'t have the resources to build a war fleet at 
all. By 1206, however they\'re supposed to be fighting a war two 
sectors away??? Gimmie a break folks.

 MicroJumps are, as far as I can tell, canonical (there\'s that
 word, again) back to the Little Black Books, and were used for
 exactly the purpose in your example.  As I recall, in Classic
 Traveller, they took the same amount of fuel as a J1 for the ship
 in question; in MT, they took half that.

Hi, Here\'s small warship to fill full of holes.

Janes fighting ship of the galaxy 1102

ANNIHILATION CLASS CLOSE ESCORT:

  In 1014 the Solomani navy begain its\' Close escort high mobility program (CEH
M). The CEHM program called for a ship to be able to make at least 2 jump of at
 lest jump 4 without refueling and still have 40g of maneuvering left when comp
leting these jumps.  OF the six ship entered in the competion the eventual winn
er was the Annihilation Class close Escort.
         Filling the requirment of the CEHM project plus Mcgirk\'s Aero-space pr
omise to "Crank \'em out" was enoguth to win the competion.  For the next severa
l yars McGirk Aerospace, adn many othe companies cranked out large number of th
e Annihilation Class.  This high voluem porducation eneded when the Solomani na
vy took the Annihilaiton out of front-line servie and placed most of the into r
eserve fleets and secondary roles.
     The solomani navy regarede the Annihilatiuon as something of mixed blessin
g.  The Annihilation had an enormous amount of mobility and maneuver fuel, but
only average fire power.  This lack of fire power and sparse hull armor was a h
andycap for the Annihilation when fighting frist line imperaila forces.  Also d
uty on this ship was less then desirable.  The Annihilation is a tight design,
the crew quarters are cramed in under the engineering section, and only a long
thin tube connects the bridge to the rest of the ship.  Furthermore the Annilat
ion requires a large amount of maintenace, This ment long hours for the ships
crew.

        I believe this one was dropped ... no decent explanation was ever
given as to why you could only install 1 hardpoint/100tons of ship,
regardless of whether it was a merchant or a military vessel anyway.

        Not a change from Brilliant Lances; an expansion. As to why you\'d
use a standard size socket ... so you can install a standard size turret.
Brilliant Lances was more plug\'n\'play ... notice you also couldn\'t design
your own lasers, so there was no reason to even mention other turret sizes.

improved, maybe. But I may be too optimistic.

It was arbitrary, but figure out the number of such turrets you can put
on say, a Tigress using the old deckplans as a model for turret surface
area...  I did once and found that the laser turrets alone crowded the
surface of a Tigress.  It was for that reason that I always thought in
terms of factors for old HG stuff.  I considered batteries to just be
bigger, or better guns, not just piles of smaller ones.  In TNE terms,
it might be the difference between a ROF 100 150MJ LT and a ROF 800 one.

Any future incarnation of FF&S or FF&S Light should weight factors
(assuming a return to HG/MT UCPs) by discharge energy, and ROF (number
of weapons is just an ROF improvement except in the case of critical
hits (really small ships, anyway)).
 
Wow, quite a digression.

Agreed.  I\'d like to see it fixed, but a lot of it\'s worthwhile.

When I last talked to Ken Whitman (of Imperium Games) he implied that this
year may be too busy to allow either he or Marc Miller to get to the Euro
Gen Con.

However, BITS (British Isles Traveller Support) are intending to run a

***** Traveller Tournament *****

on the Saturday at Euro Gen Con, as well as:

*** Participation/Demonstration games ***

all the other days.

We are collaborating with other groups to try to make this the main \'launch\'
of the new Traveller in the UK. We are hoping to organise special Traveller
issues of the UK RPG magazine * Valkyrie * magazine and we hope (God
willing) to be selling the new Traveller with supplements to allow people to
go straight back to their favourite "Milieu 1100" (i.e. the \'known\' Third
Imperium) in addition to the Imperium Games "Milieu 0" setting.

Much of this still remains to be \'cast in stone\' with Ken and Marc, but we
hope to provide Traveller with a good marketing opportunity in the UK.

NOTE: If anyone in the British Isles (ok, Northern Europe even?) is
interested in helping with this, or just in attending Euro Gen Con to play
or referee in the tournament, please send me an e-mail with your details. In
fact, if any of you across the Atlantic will be making the big trip across
to England, please contact me too! :-)

I was looking through World Tamers Handbook last night.  I\'m trying to build
a quasi economic model of Aubaine.  Here\'s my problem.

Path of Tears - pg.26 - "Most Schalli on Aubaine are engaged in ...
agriculture.  Most of the sea farming on Aubaine is done by the Schalli...."

This by itself does not constitute a problem as...

World Tamer\'s Handbook - pg.27 - "Capital:  This represents ... for
agriculture ... plows, barns, fishing boats ...."

The agricultural pursuits of the Schalli would be part of the agriculture
for the economic model.  My problem comes in that pages 20-21 of World
Tamer\'s Handbook give no clue as to the useable area or richness of water
hexes.  Some portion of the water is going to be unuseable as algae farms
due to shipping lanes, fishing areas, public boating areas, etc.  Also,
should fishing be treated as harvasting crops or as livestock?  I would
appreciate some help on this matter.

(I also think that water hexes should be given raw material useable area and
richness values.  What about offshore drilling and, at higher tech levels,
underwater mining?)

Awaiting comments!!

This is an excellent point.  I agree that neither the Coalition nor the
Regency *SHOULD* be able to expand this quickly, and yet in Vampire Fleets
we are given a quote that tells us that they at least have met and learned
something about one another.  See below comments on meeting vs expansion.

I like that idea as well.  IIRC wasn\'t Capital an Ancient site?  I don\'t
have my MT stuff with me, but I seem to recall that there was some type of
Ancient stuff on Capital.

I agree that it is a bit too much to believe that the RC would accept these
machines as Citizens, but the Vampire Fleets book says just that.  (I know
that the books are just a guide.)  The book goes on to say that the division
over this issue breaks across all other issues (Centrist/Federalist) in
government.  I can immagine this would be a subject of great controversy.
Initially, many Citizens would be appalled by this decision, but little by
little the prejudice would disappear.

The Regency sourcebook says that the Regency by 1202 has started expanding.  
IIRC, they have begun a few missions into Gushemege and/or Ilelish Sectors.
IIRC, there is some sentiment in the Regency to rebuild the old Imperium
with Norris\' ideals.  The Regency is ready to expand.  I think that
resources and distance would be problems, aren\'t they always in a war?

Right now I\'m not Gaming (I don\'t think they know what it is here in
Mississipppi), so I\'m using my free time to develop the RC.  On a whim, I
sketched down some future events based on what info we were given in the
books.  That\'s why I can\'t just skip the books this is based on the books.

I disagree (we\'re both allowed our own opinions).

The RC hates the Imperium that caused the Rebellion.  The sourcebooks give
the impression that the typical RC Citizen almost Violently hates the idea
of another Imperium.  Also, the RC has/will allow Virus machines "with the
same values" to be Citizens.

The Regency is based on the Imperium.  The Regency is the continuation of
the Imperium.  The Regency is trying to Expand and Rebuild the Imperium.
The Regency stands for much of what the RC hates.  The Regency Hates Virus.
The Rape of Trin sent shock waves and tears throughout the Regency.  The RC
has accepted these Vile machines.

Both governments are bent on modeling the new Interstellar government on
their own ideas and these ideas are near opposites.  Both Governments are
headed into the wilds with Fighting (Virus or TEDs) on their minds.  I think
there will be a war.  I don\'t see a major battle, just a little war(Persian
Gulf not WWII).

This is why the war ends, both sides must join together if they are going to
beat the Black Curtain Virus Society.

Everything the RC stands for is contrary to "the flame" that Norris spoke
of.  The Rapidly expanding RC will leave no room in its ranks for this
Imperial sentiment.  The RC might very well benefit from a War-time economy.

I\'ll admit that I hadn\'t considered this possibility.  The first Adventure
in Vampire Fleets includes some Quotes from a "Virus expert" and she claims
that Virus activity will be increasing.  This fact is not supported
elsewhere; the facts even tend to point to a continued reduction of Virus
activity.

This is a unique idea, I\'ll have to consider it further.

You\'re right, they do need each other, I just don\'t think they will realize
this at first.  Both governments have done well without help from the other
so far, and Human pride is notorious for rejecting help until desparation
sets in. I don\'t think they are stupid enough to fight, I think they will
not look at the true issues.  I think they will look at the surface of their
opponent, not the actual facts.  The truth is that the Regency survived this
long because they were able to cooperate with other governments that
differed in ideas and priorities almost as much as the Regency and RC
differ.  The RC is based on not dictating what type of government you will
use as long as the citizens are happy about the government.  TEDs are
overthrown to help the citizens, but a couple of RC worlds are glorified
TEDs.  If Regency citizens are happy with their government, the RC (by their
own ideals) shouldn\'t force change on them.

I see this fact (and it is fact), as one of the major points of conflict

I\'m glad to see at least one thing I said sparked a majority of agreement.  :)

I agree.  A bum on drugs needs a doctor, but he may not go, and if he goes,
the doctor may not see him.  I think initially the Pride of the RC and
Regency will blind them to their need for one another.  The effects of
having to join forces against a common enemy will help them overcome these
problems, though.

I agree again.  As was mentioned earlier, though, Traveller timelines are
usually a bit compressed.  I also must admit that I was writing from memory.
I still can\'t find my originl stuff, but the more I think about it, the more
I think I had the War start in 1210 and everything else extended from there.
This is still quick, but it is a bit more believable.  I think after the
first contact, Expansion would gravitate toward the new neighbor.

These would start out as trading partners and over time either be allied

Here, I disagree.  The Aslan will expand toward their original area of
space(I think Regency Sourcebook says that they\'ve already Started).  The
Zhodani will encourage expansion as the Population increases, not slow it down.

The knowledge of each other would generate a desire for trade.  Once Trade
routes were established, worlds would be colonized.  These worlds would grow
quickly with trade and eventually start their own colonies.  The discovery
of each other would tend to cause expansion towards one another.

My ideas of the battle with the Black Curtain Virus Society are not
completely established, but I know that the Humans win.  More on this later.

Not alone, they don\'t.  I took three things into consideration when I wrote this

1.  Trade between the RC and Pocket emppires and individual planets (like
the one in Guilded Lilly) would help the RC increase its work force,
material base, and production capacity.

2.  I think a lot of help would come from the Hiver.  The RC, or so it is
hinted at, is a Hiver manipulation.  The Regency would possibly affect the
results of this manipulation.  The Hiver also didn\'t seem too fond of the
old Imperium.

3.  Much of the initial expansion by the RC is towards the Solomani Rim.  A
reuniting with the Solomanu, Vegans, and others help the RC grow.



This is all opinion.  Please, don\'t anyone get too excited about this.  You
could be right and I could be wrong, but until we know, I\'ll follow my ideas.

Also please remember to change the initial war date to 1210 and move all the
other dates back in accordance.

Sorry for such a long message.

    'body' => '     After reading the various speculations on the future history of the
RC/Regency I actually became interested in TNE history for the first time in
several years and decided what we need to see-- MILIEU 1230: The Machine Wars
(don\'t quibble with the date, I picked it at random).  The area formerly
occupied by the 3I is now split among three major interstellar powers: the
Regency, The RC, and the Black Curtain Society (BCS), but all of them are
pretty small and there\'s lots of no-man\'s-land space in-between (kinda like the
Hard Times-era map).  All of them are mutually hostile to some degree, but they
also need one another (BCS would obviously be developed further, beyond the
"Lucan of Borg" stereotype).  Re-exploration is continuing- the search for new
and more powerful allies, lost tech, etc.- but now we\'ve also got the
possibility of high-level diplomacy, large scale military and naval ops, and
more.  I suppose we\'d also have to resolve the "Empress Wave" thing, but since
I don\'t even know what that is/was (was it introduced in the Regency
Sourcebook?-- never bought it) I can\'t offer much comment there.
     GDW supposedly wanted to put the "excitement" back into Traveller by
having a small HQ, limited resources, and a generally small-scale-but-detailed
environment, but I think that experiment failed; things were too limiting and
if you didn\'t like military Smash&Grab missions you were pretty much out of
luck.  By moving the clock ahead, expanding outward a bit, and throwing some
more things into the mix I think this would be a much more viable milieu than
the "current" Milieu 1200.  Maybe I\'m oversimplifying things here, but it has
always seemed to me that for Traveller to really work it has to have a large
scale; strategic maneuvering, diplomacy, the historical sweep, the "big 
questions," all that, to me, has always been an integral part of what makes 
Traveller interesting (can you tell I was reared on MegaTraveller?), and I
think that it was a huge mistake for GDW to (more-or-less) completely take that
element away.  Plus, with the empires in conflict, you get all kinds of neat
moral ambiguities which I love so much, and which were underplayed so much as
to be virtually nonexistant in recent stuff: how much is the RC really being
manipulated by the Hivers?  what if not everybody wants to form a new Imperium
based on Norris\'s ideals?  what\'s Grandfather been up to recently?  are the
BCS really inhuman devils that must be destroyed at all costs?  and so forth.

Trent Smith
P.S.  Even if such a thing ever were to reach print, I wouldn\'t expect (or even
particularly WANT) it to be released until about five years from now-- we need
that much time to let the new and improved game flourish, to let the traumatic
memories of the "New Era" fade, and, most importantly, to rethink the whole
thing and see if we can\'t come up with some more plausible and canon-friendly 
"revisionist history" to cover the time between the Rebellion and this milieu.

berths: the chill berth and the cold berth.

The chill berth is generally found at lower tech levels (9-11).  The rate of
time passage in a chill berth is about 4 hours per 10 days in the berth.
Prolonged chill berth hibernation has the following effect:

"A character takes a 1 point wound (randomly select which characteristic)
for every continuous year he spends in a chill berth.  However, when all
characteristics have been reduced to less than 1, the character dies.

After revival, the character must spend 1D days of total inactivity for each
year spent in hibernation, during which he heals the lost 1 characteristic
point for that year (applied to the characteristic of the players choice)."

The cold berth is generally found at higher tech levels, but can be found as
low as TL9 (but people frequently died in those days, and that is where the
low lottery came in).  I could find no rate of time passage in the article,
concerning cold berths.  Prolonged cold berth hibernation works exactly the
same way as in the quotes above, but substitute "25 years" for "year".

The above was taken from The Travellers\' Digest #21, pp 40-45.  I was
surprised to see that no one else remembered this article until I remembered
which list I was reading.

difficulties and does not require ANY math
(except comparing numbers). At Difficulties of Difficult or greater
the results will be equal (except that Formidable and Impossinle 
tasks with Assets not devidable by the numbers have a propability of
exact n/2 or n/4, all without anyone doing any calculations)

Resolving tasks:

1.  Determine Difficulty, Difficulty Number (DNo) and Asset
----
2.  If difficulty is Difficult or worse (Difficulty Level 0+) continue
    with step 2.1 else with step 2.2

2.1 Roll a D20. If the result is Asset or less roll it again. If second 
    roll is DNo or less, Task is SUCCESS else Task is a FAILURE.
    Continue with step 3. (See below for examples)  

2.2 Roll a D20. If the result is Asset or less Task is success. Else if
    the result is above the DNo You may reroll. If now the
    roll is Asset or less Task is SUCCESS else Task is a FAILURE.
    Optional: You may reroll as often as the absolute Difficulty Level
    indicates. Continue with step 3. (See below for examples)

3.1 Outstanding success: If any roll is 10 or less lower the required 
    number => Outstanding success

3.2 Critical failure: If any roll is 10 or more greater the required
    number => Critical failure

3.3 If one roll indicates critical failure and one critical success, they
    cancel each other out. Note that at difficulties of less than 
    Difficult even critical failures may be rerolled if greater than
    DNo. Normal successes may be rerolled(if greater DNo) to get outstanding

Firing stats:
   Firing stats for weapons have to be modified. There are three
   ways:

4. The rugged way: Simply change nothing. If the range is in a gray
   zone between range bands, use the intermediate Difficulty Level.

5. The nice way:

5.1 Table based: 

5.1.1 Create Table:
      Create twenty numbers for every weapon, based on its 
      range. They are calculated by 
      ((long range-short range)/20*n)+ short range, where n is the zero
      based index of the number.

5.1.2 Determine DNo:
      Count the numbers on this table until You are at the first number
      greater or equal to the target distance. This count is the DNo for
      a Quick Shot firing task. If shot was Aimed halve the target distance
      before comparing it to the table. For every difficulty increase
      double the traget distance (Sorry for this but it is the 
      easiest way to do it without generating lots tables)
      See below for example.

5.2 Math Based: 

5.2.1 Create new weapon stats:
      For all people who don\'t like tables. The range stats
      for a weapon is given by a Range Number, and a Divisor.
      The Divisor is equal to (long range) / 20 and should be
      rounded to 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100..., the "natural" division numbers
      for a ten based system (with only 2\'s and 5\'s in them)
      The Range Number is equal to Short range / Divisor.
      See below for example.
5.2.2 Determine DNo:
      The task is rolled using rule 2.1, exception: see below
      DNo=Base DNo + Range Number - (distance to target/Divisor)
      Base DNo: DNo for Difficult+ Tasks, 40+Range Number for Easy tasks.
      If the DNo is 28 or greater the task becomes Easy Difficult(14),
      if it is 40 or greater it becomes Easy(10).

6. The realistic(TM) way:

6.1 This way is similar to the nice math based way, but with some 
    modifications.

6.1.1 Determine the difficulty of the task normaly, without considering
      Range.
6.2.2 Roll for SUCCESS. If FAILURE shot is a miss else continue with
      6.2.3
6.2.3 Roll again to confirm hit. If roll is less or equal DNo
      determined in 5.2.2 shot is a hit else it misses. However
      the rerolls in 2.2 may be used for this roll.

Hi,
There has been alot of talk lately about how Traveller doesn\'t use alot
of the new sci-fi technologies such as nanotech, cybernetics, genetic
engineering etc. I don\'t think that is a huge problem. 
With nanotech, we can assume alot of this takes place
behind the scenes, the TL-15 computers could have nanomachines inside of
them constantly repairing damaged components.  Perhaps the construction of
Bonded Superdense involves nanomachines arranging the atoms in the proper
structures.  These are fairly mundane uses of nanotech, for the really
radical uses such as rewriting human DNA at a mere thought, (For more
examples see the BOHR MAKER by Linda Nagata, pretty cool sci-fi novel) Imperial
society frowns on these.  We already know that Imperial society frowns
on psionics, so why not other things which don\'t appear in canon. 
The Imperium limits Robots, (See Book 8) it doesn\'t allow really dangerous 
Warbots.  So it seems reasonable to assume they prohibit other things
which would disrupt society.  After all  the Vilani are still a force
in Imperial politics, and they are very conservative about new technology. 
        If you want a really radical society based on
the use of Nano-tech put it on an amber or red zone planet, or on one
of the numerous splinter states on the edge of the Imprerium. 
        Another thing, is if you are playing in the New Era, with the 
destruction of Imperial society, many of the social prohibitions will 
also be destroyed.  Many of the planets in the Wilds use psionics, why
can\'t they also change their opionion of nanotech, or cybernetics.
Most won\'t have the technological skills, but there are some bastions
of high tech out there. (What would be the TL of nanotech be anyway?) 
I can see alot of TEDs equiping their troops with cybernetic equipment,
or using  nanotech weapons that dissolve the enemy into puddles of goo.

Just a few thoughts.

I would except to see a very rough period as the silicon based life forms are 
introduced as members of the society. I expect a lot of racist feeling will be 
there, attacks on virus based ships, segregation etc. Human have a long memory 
of events and it will not be a short time for true integration. I would 
expect this to take hundreds of years, (considering how good we are at 
integrating between various human races)

Nope, I read that as, the Regency knows about the RC (Information from the 
the Free Trader Network), and that in 1206 it learns from the Free Trader
Network the what the actions of the RC have been, (2 years for the information
to cross the gap sounds about right), the news would have been
passed from ship to ship and the news to spread. The quote comes from the
Quarantine Service which of course will be the most anti virus group in the
Regency you will find

The Regency and the RC have not formally met, but they know of each other and 
the actions that have been taken (Free Trader network again) to recover.


I doubt that the RC and Regency will declare war on each other for years after
that (they are not close enough), however skirmishes between Silicon crewed RC
ships and Regency exploration vessels in the Wilds may occur.

Personally I see the RC having too many problems in its own backyard to worry
about the Regency. The Guild, the Empire of Solee, and the problems due the
the granting of silicon based lifeforms based lifeforms citizenship, will all
cause problems. Then there is the problem of the rather large vampire fleet
just round the corner that is not friendly.

The RC does not have the power (yet) to be a conquering force. It took a 
thousand years for the Third imperium to get to the size it was before it 
collapsed. I can see it taking a hundred year or more before the Regency 
and the RC are truely face to face. The wilds are a mess, No commander is 
going to launch battle fleets in to there, with out surveys and information 
about the lay of the land. Thus your timeline seems a little condensed from my
reading of the books

You tend to get the richest ecosystems in the arctic, where nutrient- and
oxygen-rich water wells up to the surface over areas of (relative) shallows. 
(Eg. the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.)  I would assume that shipping lanes
consume the same space in water as roads do on land (ie. quite a bit, but
subsumed within other land uses).  

I would treat fishing as harvesting crops, with the proviso that fish require
no cultivation (thus the workers can do something else when not fishing). 
This changes if you start fish farms - in this case they should be considered
livestock.  Remember that many marine animals (fish) are migratory - in
effect there will be a limited \'growing season\'.  

One thing that you should add to your model is water transport.  I found that
an interesting lack in WT, especially as Terry wrote the Wet Navy ship design
rules for MT.  Assume that any hex with a navigable waterway (or coastline)
has a resource transport route (no need to build a railway unless you need
speed).  

>(I also think that water hexes should be given raw material useable area and
>richness values.  What about offshore drilling and, at higher tech levels,

This is true.  There is the possibility for _major_ resource exploitation,
with depth as a limiting factor.  The deeper the site the more it costs to
mine it (although the cost of this should go down with increasing tech
levels.  But some resources will be better found in space (eg. metals).

There are a wide variety of languages in Charted Space. Most of
them are known on only one planet, or in a small polity. A few are
spread widely by the political and cultural influences of their
speakers. The languages of this second group become widely known
not as primary languages for a large number of planets, but as
second languages for an entire region of space. The languages known
as _Trade_Vilani_, _Galanglic_, and _Basic_Sylean_ are languages
that have served and do serve this purpose in Regency space.

_Trade_Vilani_ has its origins in the language now known as High
Vilani. When the First Imperium was governing Imperial Space, the
Vilani rulers, in an attempt to impose cultural homogeneity and
stability on their empire, mandated the use of their language in
all governmental and commercial communication. Since enforcement of
this mandate was difficult at any level where the local populace
was not dealing directly with Vilani, many people did not use
Vilani in their day-to-day activities, and when they did need to
use it, it was generally in a grammatically incorrect form that was
nevertheless sufficient to transmit the intended meaning. In
linguistics, these languages are called "pidgins".

It was economically impossible for the Vilani to maintain their
absolute monopoly on the operation of starships once the size of
the Imperium grew beyond the equivalent of six subsectors or so.
This was still sufficient to ensure that some form of Vilani was in
use on all of the planets as a "common" language. When planetary
concerns and governments were permitted to operate their own
starships, it was natural that they should use their ungrammatical
Vilani to communicate with each other. There are examples from many
planets demonstrating that communication has a leveling effect on
dialectal differences; the First Imperium was proof that this same
principle operated on an interstellar level as well. The result was
"Trade Vilani".

The Rule of Man had a similar effect. Here, the mandated language
was _Terran_Anglic_, a language that was itself a pidgin (based on
English) resulting from a commercial and technological advantage
possessed by North America at the time that global communication
and commerce became practical for the majority of the population,
instead of for just a few large corporations. Changes in political
and economic dominance allowed Spanish and Chinese to influence the
language, and at the time that the Rule of Man was proclaimed,
Terran Anglic would have been incomprehensible to an American or
Englishman of Terran Year CE2000.

Most planets in the First Imperium had been using Trade Vilani in
interstellar commerce; it was to be expected that it would continue
to be used to fill in gaps in the speaker\'s knowledge of Terran
Anglic, despite being officially "banned" from official use. The
short duration of the Rule of Man, only 400 years, was sufficient
to expose most planets to some use of Terran Anglic (which was now
being called _Galactic_Anglic_, or _Imperial_Anglic_). Small
communities of ethnic Terrans (or of people who considered
themselves ethnic Terrans, despite having never been on Terra) were
to be found on most of the important worlds of the Empire,
including Sylea and Vland, as resident administrators. These
communities survived into the Long Night, preserving the use of
Imperial Anglic on those worlds, and on many nearby worlds within
their economic influence.

During the Dawn, when the Zhunatsu family and their companies
created the Sylean Federation, they took the pragmatic view of the
question of language. Instead of mandating that Sylean be used
exclusively, they gave it and Imperial Anglic equal status. \\De
jure\\ equality does not mean \\de facto\\ equality, and it was
quickly noticed that the use of Sylean offered subtle political and
economic benefits when dealing with Syleans. Nevertheless, Imperial
Anglic was firmly entrenched, and remained widely used, absorbing
terms from Sylean as it had from Trade Vilani centuries earlier.

The Sylean Federation offered a high degree of autonomy to its
member planets. In doing so, it relinquished its ability to
influence linguistic development to the degree possible for the
Rule of Man or the Vilani Imperium before it. As a result of this
lesser influence, and the early decision to recognize the use of
Imperial Anglic in government and commerce, the Sylean language
never achieved the level of importance that Imperial Anglic and
Trade Vilani achieved.

The creation of _Basic_Sylean_ was an effort to remedy this
problem. Developed by a team of Sylean linguists, it offered a
simpler grammatical structure, paralleling that of Imperial Anglic
(although the more complex Sylean grammar could be used), and a
reduced vocabulary. Inflections were for the most part eliminated,
as were irregular verbs. Basic Sylean enjoyed a period of
popularity, but it was not able to completely displace Imperial
Anglic anywhere.

By the time Cleon I declared the Third Imperium, Imperial Anglic
had been heavily influenced by Basic Sylean, and would have been
incomprehensible to Admiral Estigarriba (Emperor Hiroshi I of the
Rule of Man), or to any Terran/Solomani of the period immediately
prior to the Rule of Man. Basic Sylean and Trade Vilani were still
used in areas where recent influence from their respective planets
of origin was strong, but Imperial Anglic, now universally called
_Galactic_Anglic_, or _Galanglic_, was \\de facto\\ the primary
common language of the Third Imperium throughout its expansion, and
into the Rebellion period.

In spite of this, Trade Vilani, Terran/Imperial Anglic, and Basic
Sylean can all be found in the Regency, due both to patterns of
settlement and to the Imperial policy of local autonomy. Galanglic,
as the official language of the Regency government, is used and
understood almost everywhere in the Spinward States. It provides a
common language that binds us together in a single interstellar
community, and it is also the primary language for intership and
ship-to-shore communications.

A dialect of Terran Anglic or Imperial Anglic is used for local
communications in the former Sword Worlds, and in the few remaining
independent worlds operating under that name. An even older
dialect, heavily influenced by teZhlodh (the original Daryen native
language) has the status not of a pidgin, but of a creole, in the
Daryen Confederation.

Many parts of Deneb sector use Trade Vilani; these worlds were
heavily influenced by the Vilani in the early days of colonization,
as prior to the sector gaining Administered Sector status, it was
governed from Corridor or Vland sector. Trade Vilani and Basic
Sylean are used fairly heavily near the Aslan worlds in Trojan
Reach sector; this is due to historical reasons in connection with
contact with the Aslan: The original contact between the Imperium
and the Aslan was in Daibei Sector, which was colonized by the
Vilani during the First Imperium, and which maintained its
Vilani-derived culture right through the Rule of Man and the
founding of the Third Imperium and into First Contact with the
Aslan. A dialect of Trade Vilani, heavily influenced by Trokh (and
called by the Aslan \\trokh fiyalr\\) was thereby established as a
trade language between the Aslan and the Imperium. When the Aslan
were encountered on the other side of the Rift, the Sylean
expedition that made contact was unable to communicate in \\trokh
fiyalr\\, but since the commander of the Aslan fleet that made
contact was the second son of a former Aslan ambassador to the
Imperium, there was enough knowledge of Trade Vilani and Basic
Sylean to establish communication. These languages became
established for use in communicating with trans- Rift Aslan, as
\\trokh fiyalr\\ had in the rimward areas of the Imperium.

A hail from Commander X

Greetings one and all

I wish to declare a new forum where traveller fans of all versions can chat
and relay messages in real time...Introducing...

<Fanfare and Drumroll>

The Traveller RPG Powwow Tribe


first a disclaimer....
this tribe is in no way afilliated with Imperium Games or the Now defunct
GDW.  I\'m not making any money from this...its all free, just a place for
people to come together and talk Traveller in any version.
(However, If you want me to work for you Marc, I could use the job! :) :) )

what is Powwow you ask?
Its a chat program devloped by a company called Tribal Voice and is
available Free of charge. It allows up to 7 people to chat in real time and....

IT\'S MUCH EASIER THAN IRC!!!!

How do I get the program? Easy just set co-ordinates on your browser to:
http://www.enterprise1701.com and look for the Powwow ver 2.1 link.  Thats
the easiest way I know to get there...

Also while there look for the Traveller RPG tribe, just follow the links to
the sign up page. you\'ll see my name there beside there.

Ok, you say I got the program, and I\'m signed up now what do I do?
Well you need to have Powwow running (duh!) and then either click the icon
on the web page or click "connect" on Powwow and type my email address,
which happens to be the same as the powwow adress! cmdrx@magicnet.net. If I
am online we\'ll be chatting! Its that simple!!!!

Well that\'s about it.  For more info go to the Enterprise 1701 homepage.
that URL again is http://www.enterprise1701.com/
Its a fantasy,sci-fi, horror web site for a gameing store in Orlando FL,
lots of good stuff there....but Powwow is it\'s major claim to fame!

Pasedena CA -- In an announcement bound to produce shockwaves
around the world,  a government source disclosed a report which states
that data from the Galileo Mission to study the planet Jupiter has lead to
the conclusion that the lower atmosphere of Jupiter is "teaming with life."


The Galileo spacecraft recently launched a probe directly into the
atmosphere of Jupiter to study such things as atmospheric gasses,
weather, and radiation.  The information gathered during the probe\'s trip
will take years to analyze, but the source states that early data has
detected the presence of organic chemicals and gasses that are the
"signature of life."

Scientists have long speculated that the atmosphere of Jupiter may
contain alien organisms.  "The concept is not that shocking when you
consider the many forms of life that habituate the harshest environments
on Earth," stated John Furtheminer, Ph.D. noted exobiologist.  "We find
anaerobic bacteria deep in the ice of Antarctica, and tube worms in the
crushing depths of the ocean. While the upper layers of the atmosphere
are composed of very cold gasses, the mid and lower layers are
warmer and in fact are much like the eprimordial soup of  Earth a couple
of billion years ago.  Many of us have felt that the probability of life in the
lower Jovian atmosphere was quite high."

The bigger surprise was the revelation that the Galileo probe carried an
onboard camera.  NASA never publicly announced that photography
was to be a part of the mission leading to the speculation that part of the
mission was "Classified" due to strong evidence of the possibility that life
would be discovered.

This information is bound to further feed the criticism by those who
believe that the government has routinely concealed evidence of
extraterrestrial life like the famous Roswell alien specimens rumored to
be in storage at the mysterious Area 51, a classified military facility in
Nevada.

What is Jovian life like?  "I think we will see the kind of diversity we see
on Earth," stated Furtheminer.  "I would expect everything from
microscopic organisms to great floating membranes that thrive in the
windy atmosphere much like jellyfish floating in the ocean currents."

The government source could not confirm that pictures of Jovian
organisms actually exist.

It would take time for complete acceptance, but initial acceptance would be

many people who don\'t care what the *&$%&*$ machine says, it should be

The quote uses the phrase "you Coalition People" which gives me the

Free Traders.  I don\'t see this the way you do.

A good point, you have to have a capital expenditure for boats and warfs
rather than trucks and roads.  I\'ll have to mull this one over.

While you\'re thinking about this stuff, I have another question for you...

Muir, Lewis, and I are working on using the Economic model to develop the
RC.  Helios, as the smallest population world is where we decided to start.
According to PoT, Helios has a large service industry to facilitate the
weekly Auction.  How does a dervice industry fit into the Economic model?
After all, Haircuts and eating out requires labor and capital, but yeilds no
tangible result.  However, Both should increase the "standard of living."
And what about corporate services (accounting and marketing firms)?

Just a few thoughts to rattle around in your brain.

Eagerly awaiting responses,

Paul  {tiger}

Hi
I recently read FIREDANCE by Steven Barnes, and he had a paragraph
that I found interesting. It was talking about a computer virus.

        "Versa, the Niptech virtual rom, had duplicated all of
the mainframe protocols.  It sat in there for months, absorbing
information, then sending it out of the building."
        Aubry felt genuinely confused. "It did all of that just in the
software?"
        "No.  But the main computer has its own nanotech repair
bots. Versa, ah ..." Gagnon was searching for words.
"Subverted them. Under the command of Versa, modifications
were made  to the physical structure of the machine.
        Aubry fought to remeber something that Leslie ahd
taught him. "Aren\'t your computers sealed from the outside?
No lines in or out?"
        "Yep. But everytime we moved information out to 
another machine, it beat us. Say we moved data in physical
storage, on a bubble chip. Versa created dual formating
on that chip, increased the storage, created an invisible
island of instructions and information. When the chip 
reached a machine that did have communication with the
exterior world, it executed its instructions, and conveyed
its data to the outside world.  Brilliant, simple, damn 
near unbeatable."

That\'s how I think of Virus. I still think the transponder part 
seems a big dopey. I am not trying to restart the arguments on well 
thought out Virus was, I just thought you might be interested in
what another author thought. It also is an possible use of nanotech
behind the scenes.

Wharfs are a _lot_ cheaper than roads.  And tonne to tonne, boats are cheaper
than rail, rail is cheaper than roads.  (If the US and Canadian highway
systems weren\'t so massively subsidized, we would use more rail than we do.) 


To a first approximation, boats are cheaper by two orders of magnitude. 
(Based on designs I worked up for MT.)  Possibly more, I think I was
underestimating the cost of land-based infrastructure.  On the other hand, a
water-based system still needs local land-based trans-shipment, so two orders
of magnitude should hold.  

Note that this will also tend to spread your settlement along navigable
waterways.


>How does a dervice industry fit into the Economic model?

Divide the service industry into two parts.  The bit that serves the home
market doesn\'t increase productivity, but does increase standard of living
(which makes for happier citizens).   The bit that serves off-worlders could
be treated like \'farming\' a resource for capital.  (Tourist credits.)  

This would be a bit more complicated to model, as tourists/businessmen/etc
also respond to information.  On the upside, think of the adventure
possibilities.  The players are forced to do some low-level roleplaying to
keep a bunch of Oriflammen technarchs happy so they deliver a favourable
report back home!  

One point you should consider is that World Tamers deals with fairly small
planned economies.  Larger planned economies and free-market economies will
need to be handled differently.

virtual reality sufficiently sophisticated to overcome a lot of the 
claustrophobia on board starships? I got to try a three million pound flight 
simulator last year and that was impressive enough (no moving floor, it was
a graphics demonstrator only, but people still lost their balance when I banked 
just because of the visual cues)

As for stateroom sizes, I don\'t think that the 3.5m high deck model is 
appropriate for drawing up plans. A 3.5m x 4m x 4m stateroom would seem very 
strange (when was the last time you were in a cubic room?), more realistic size 
would be perhaps 2.4m x 4.8m x 4.8m. Even allowing for corridors, recreation 
areas etc. there would still be a room maybe 3.5 - 4m each side, slightly 
larger than the room I\'m writing this in.

Use imagination to sort these problems out, a middle passage stateroom on a 
battered old trader might be described as
\'The room is clean enough, but between the metal panels of the ceiling there\'s 
a distinct black line, dirt to remind you that the bubble wrap had been taken 
off the minimal fitted furniture long ago, like the rings left in the deep red 
wood of the bedside table by decades of hot drinks in mugs. The single light in 
the ceiling lights everything brightly, perhaps slightly too brightly, but it 
doesn\'t look like it\'ll give you much of a headache so you ignore it. As you 
sit on the bed you notice the bolts which hold it crudely to the floor. Perhaps 
in the past the ship was in the habit of running the engines hard enough to 
overload the G-compensators, to get away from pirates, or the law, hard to 
imagine that now. There is a soft hum from engineering which the sound-proofing 
doesn\'t quite cut out, but it seems relaxing, making the surroundings seem 
familiar.
As you lie down to sleep, your eyes draw level with the wooden bedside table, 
and you notice three words scratched into the wood, \'Good night, Traveller\' you 
read, as you shut your eyes to sleep.\'

Whereas high passage on a Regency liner might be:
\'As you walk into the room you breath a breath a welcome breath of fresh air, 
the delicate fragrance of the plants growing by the window forming a marked 
contrast to the smoky atmosphere of the casino. You notice that the lights in 
the room have dimmed to a gentle yellow glow from the bright daylight they 
produced earlier. The window displays a scene of a sunset over a mountain 
valley, a system of lenses over the screen producing an illusion of depth. In 
one corner of the room a concealed camera observes your movements and updates 
the image to give a startling appearance of reality. It looks so real that you 
almost wish you could go outside and be part of it, but the illusion of a 
summer evening is convincing enough, so why fight it?
The room is silent, except for the low sound of the breeze moving past the 
window whose view has been captured for your pleasure. The bedsheets, 
impeccably white, are embroidered with a large unicorn insignia, the emblem of 
Norris. According to the small card propped on the table by the bed, these were 
originally from the old frontier cruiser \'Arrival Vengence\', and were bought at 
auction when serious superdense fatigue in the hull meant that she finally had 
to be decommisioned for good. As you fall asleep the room\'s monitors supply a 
gentle melody to ease you into your dreams...\'

With regard to providing corridors for engineering, flight decks, etc. why not 
assume, as with quarters that a certain percentage of the volume for 
engineering is given over to crawlways and access corridors? It\'s probably 
easier than adding more rules to FFS. If you want to add high levels of detail 
to a design, the ship plans offer a good outlet for that kind of fine attention 
to detail.

Okay, please forgive my ignorance, as I am at work and can\'t reference 
anything, but does the 3.5m figure include just open space or does it include 
all the things between here and the \'next\' level?  If the latter, then there 
is probably a ceiling at around 2.4m, with the 1.1m in between the ceiling and 
the floor of the deck above containing life support systems, power, lighting, 
etc. -- iin other words, all the things that you would hide behind a false 
ceiling.  Given the space constraints in a ship, 1.1m may be a bit excessive.

I would expect that the floor would be a raised floor as well, similar to 
those found in computer rooms.

    'body' => 'I just got an idea for the future of FF&S that might just make everyone
happy(fat chance).  

I envision three books:

1.    Traveller Technology - FF&S Elite:  This book would be a carbon copy
of the current FF&S, possibly a little more detailed, but definitely only
using Trav universe technology.  Include detailed design sequences as well
as side bars explaining future technology. (Alternate technology is already
covered in the current FF&S.)  This book is for the major deep-in-it
gearhead.  100-ton Starship Design Time: 1-2hrs.  Example:  A design
sequence for Jump Drives explaining what the Hydrogen Fuel is used for and
how alternate energy sources can be used.

2.    Design Sequence - This book would contain two parts:
        Part A - FF&S Veteran:  This section contains generic charts for
each component based on the info from book one.  The design sequence would
be a bit more detailed than the current MT system.  Designing something is a
matter of pulling the correct numbers from the correct charts, very few
calculations.  This is for the gearhead wannabe.  100-ton Starship Design
Time:  30min-1hr.  Example:  A chart listing volume/mass/price for J1-J6 per
100-tons.
        Part B - FF&S Experienced:  This section would include generic
charts for modules (J1/M3 Module, Sensor3/Comm2 Module, Weapons 2 Module)
based on the info from books one and two.  The design sequence would be
similar to the plug-and- play sequence that some have requested on the list.
Pick five to ten modules add the volume/mass/power/price and you\'re done.
This is for the non-gearhead who wants variety without a lot of time and
effort.  100-ton Starship Design Time: 5-30min.  Example:  A chart listing
volume/mass/power/price for J1M1 to J6M6 modules per 100-ton.

2.    FF&S Novice:  This book would contain a multitude of ships, vehicles,
and weapons created with the first three books.  All designs would be
playtested. There is no design sequence, just pick which one you want.  This
is for the standard designs.  100-ton Starship Design Time: 1-5min (you
might have trouble making a decision).  Example:  The well-known 100-ton
Scout/Courier


All three books would be interchangeable.  In other words, suppose you want
a J2/M3 ship with laser turrets and super comm/sensor suite.  You glance
through FF&S Novice, and don\'t see what you\'re looking for.  You look in
FF&S Experienced and pick the J2/M3 Module and the Laser 2 Module, but none
of the Sensor/Comm Modules is exactly what you\'re looking for.  No problem,
use either FF&S Veteran or FF&S Elite to handpick your sensor/comm suite.
Finish the ship with either handpicked items or standard modules, and you\'re
done.

The most important part is the interrelationship.  When I didn\'t understand
a part of FF&S, I picked up the TNE rules book and tried to create one of
the Vehicles in there.  It didn\'t work, and I still didn\'t understand the
FF&S rule.  If the books can be used together, I would be able to do this.

The other thing that would need to be considered would be the
price/size/tech level issue.  A TL-12 type computer produced at TL-15 would
be much cheaper and much smaller than a TL-12 computer produced at TL-12.  I
know this is old material.

I have to give credit to Muir, he got me thinking along the lines of Novice,
Experienced, Veteran, and Elite for another project.

Anyway, if you\'re still listening, Mr. Miller, This is just my idea to try
to solve everyone\'s questions.

Just my 2Cr.

Hi,

The thing that always annoyed me with COACC (the MT aircraft design rules)
is the names of the planes.

The book says that the Imperium names their planes after Terran cities.  
Why would the Imperium name planes after cities on the homeworld of
one of their chief enemies.  Another thing, is that most people wouldn\'t 
even know the names of cities on Terra, in real life, most people don\'t 
know alot of cities in other countries.  Also I just can\'t see my players
being worried about being attacked by a San Diego Fighter plane. 
So I came up with alternative names for the planes.  Some are better than 
others, I don\'t know how much use this is to anyone, but I was typing 
it up for my own use, so I figured I\'d send along a copy to the 
mailing list.

With no need for infrastructure, it\'s no wonder Aubaine whethered the
Collapse so well even with the influx of refugee\'s during the Final War.  So
how about this:

  Water Hexes:
     Richness:
        From the Freeze line, 
             1st row:   1.4 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)   - too coldfor high richnness 
             2nd row:   1.7 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)   - ideal
             3rd row:   1.4 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)

             6th row:   0.8 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)
             7th row:   0.6 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)
             8th row:   0.5 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)   - warm
             9th row:   0.3 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)   - hot
            10th row:   0.1 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)   - getting hotter
            11th row:   0.0 +/- .3 (1D6 x .1)   - too hot


      Useable Area:
         pole1st row:   90% +/- 10% (1D10)
             2nd row:   90% +/- 10% (1D10)
             3rd row:   90% +/- 10% (1D10)   
             4th row:   90% +/- 10% (1D10)

         equ11th row:   60% +/- 10% (1D10)    - shipping lanes  

                Ice Cap hexes = 0%


Does this look like it migh work?

Something like a 1/4 year growing season at 4 locations.  During the season,
the workers would "harvest" fish.  A generic fishing richness number could
be provided, and the useable area would be the same as above.  When the
season was over, and the schools moved, the workers would go back to their
farms while other workers in other areas would leave their farms to go fish,
so the net change in workers would be negligible for most of the year.  I
know this leaves no time for replenishment for the fish, but the model
leaves no room for allowing soil to regain nutrients either.  to be more
realistic, I guess you could limit the fishing to half the year like the
agriculture growing period.

A good point, you have to have a capital expenditure for boats and warfs
rather than trucks and roads.  I\'ll have to mull this one over.

I\'ll have to work up some charts on this based on distance from land hexes
and such.


While you\'re thinking about this stuff, I have another question for you...

Muir, Lewis, and I are working on using the Economic model to develop the
RC.  Helios, as the smallest population world is where we decided to start.
According to PoT, Helios has a large service industry to facilitate the
weekly Auction.  How does a dervice industry fit into the Economic model?
After all, Haircuts and eating out requires labor and capital, but yeilds no
tangible result.  However, Both should increase the "standard of living."
And what about corporate services (accounting and marketing firms)?

Just a few thoughts to rattle around in your brain.

Eagerly awaiting responses,

Paul  {tiger}

Yeap I agree with that, of cause, in the future you could see development of 
virus equivalent of the Black Panthers, Black Muslum movement, or some less 
extreme groups demanding equal rights. All things which the RC may have to 
face in the future.

Either Free traders born in the RC with RC symathies, or a RC sponsered 
Trading vessel. I would believe that if you come from the RC area you would
classed as a "Coalition Person" even if you were not in the RCS, so the 
commodore could have been speaking to any one

I still don\'t see a war as being an all out war, I see it more as the War 
between the Spanish and the  English in the reign of Elizabeth the First. 
Privateers operating in far flung areas away from either Spain or England.
Raid on ports in the new world. Very few large scale fleet battles as
they are very costly in terms of ships and supplies. And little or no 
action in either the Regency or the RC (or close to their respective borders).
I could see the Regency aiding the Empire of Solee (and I could see the Guild
making the most of the Chaos that would follow)

No real victory happens and a uneasy peace treaty would develop from that.

        The 3.5m isn\'t the ceiling height inside the room -- it also
includes the space _between_ the decks, so it\'s the distance from one floor
to the next:

        I\'ve always assumed the "floors" were airtight bulkheads, as well as
containing all the usual mechanical stuff needed for the life support,
power, comm, water, sewage, etc. I figure that takes 1m out of the height,
leaving the actual floor-to-ceiling at 2.5m.

        I agree, to an extent. But the purpose of the discussion was to find
some way to better differentiate between the tradeoffs needed to design a
luxury liner, a tramp freighter, and a military vessel.

Agreed.  I just finished reading it, and highly recommend it.  Stephenson
tends to take the effects of technology to the "N\'th" extreme, which
produces both amusing and frightening results.

Quite right, but the life support systems and other ducting should have their

of the stateroom.

This worked in CT, but neither in MT or TNE. The volume of artificial gravity
and life support is not any longer counted against the volume of the
staterooms. Each deck would be 3.5m high, the stateroom somewhat less
(I assume 2.5m) but the 1m inbetween does not count against the volume of
the stateroom ! However, I draw large staterooms still 4x4m and 2x4m and
assign the remaining volume (16m^3 for large and 8m^3 for small staterooms)
to the corridors and recreation area. This would give me about 6m^2 of
additional area for each large and 3m^2 for each small stateroom.
    An other thing about the size of staterooms. We camped in a trailer
5m x 2m large with 4 persons (2 adult , 2 kids) and lived there for 3 weeks.
 It would\'ve been possible to live there with 3 adults instead,
resulting in 3.3 m^3 or, in volume 7.3 m^3 (2.2m ceiling) per person.
We had a kitchen, toilet/washing room and storage for our clothing. The
space in a double occupancy small stateroom is twice that. I must admit
that we didn\'nt spent most of the time in the trailer, but I think it 
is possible(if the people don\'t hate each other or are a trained military
crew) However, I think this is the absolute limit for non military ships,
if You don\'t want circumstances as on the "wet" ships in the 17th century.
    On space stations, an erea of about 50m^2 should be the minimum per 
person, resulting in about 12 disp tons per huge stateroom. This should also
be the limit for super luxury ships. (It includes med station and good
recreation facilities, with the stateroom itself being 9 disp tons or an
area of 6x6m, note that corridors are again bunus, each stateromm may
have about 14m^2 of hallways)
    A thing that is much more importend than the size of staterooms is
the size of crew stations. The 3.5m^3 are just rediculous. The space
per crew member in vehicles is rather in the 1.5m^3 range, and this is still
spacious. In a subcompact car the "crew station" is 0.7m wide, 1.2m high
and 1.3m long resulting in about 1m^3(and this is still a closed vehicle)
Note that the whole car (3.3x1.4x1.4) has a size of less than one half 
disp ton, space for 4 persons and over 200 litres of cargo space, 40KW
engine and total mass of 700kg. Don\'t try this with FF&S.

I have always figured on the following standards for accomodations on
merchantmen:

Lg SR (Stateroom): Good for one senior officer (05+), two other officers,
one high passenger, or two mid passengers.

Sm SR, one company/working grade officer, or two ratings, or one chief, or
one (non-regency/3rd imp) Mid Passenger.

Bunk: One (very) junior rating, or one working passenger (in a pinch).


Luxurious vessels may draw more passengers, and have varying levels of
comfort, but the bonuses require successful marketing rolls:

For each of the following, add 1 level of luxury:
        For more stewards than needed (minimum 50% more)
        For each additional 1 displacement ton per LgSR (half-ton per SmSR)
        For each cost multiple (so double cost would be 1 level, tripple cost
                fittings would be plus 2 levels etc.)
        For extras (like a workout room, pool, etc) + 1 level maximum
        For well reputed crew (lots of happy passengers in the past, and the
                current world knows it). Earned only by good roleplaying.
        Has a medbay and MD.
        has ship\'s troops totalling 10% or more of total passenger capacity at
                mid passage rates (maximum +1 level).
        per additional multiple of the per person cost for supplies spent.

Each level can be used for one of the following:
        +1d3-1 HP (two levels get +1d6-1) with a maximum of double the base
                number of dice
        +1d6-1 MP (again, maximum of double the base number of dice)
        +25% to fare cost (but this imposes a DM-1 per +10% base cost to both
                HP and MP numbers)
        +10% chance per passenger of booking round trip (requires one or two
                weeklayover and willingness to come back immediately) at same
                cost, with a base of 0%.

Using the level requires a marketing roll.

Using 1-2 levels: Average, Cr1000*1d6.
Using 3-5 levels: Difficult, Cr1000*2d6
Using 6-9 levels: Formidable, Cr1000*3d6
Using 10+ levels: Impossible, Cr2000*3d6

+1 Diffmod if using all available levels.
+1 to skill per unused level beyond the first.

Also, DM+1 to the check for a hijacking attempt per level used. (Base is
18+ on 3d6). Yes, it\'s MORE likely that someone will try to hijack... Cause
the passengers will be more wealthy! (As well as the crew, from the
increased bookings).

I also allow advertising at discount rates to modify number of passengers:

For each 10% of reduction in base fare schedule, DM+1 to HP, and DM+1 for
MP, and DM+2 for low psg. Also, DM+1 to the hijacking attempt.


My players have used this, and seem to think it feels right, but comments
and additional playtest would be appreciated. It also explains why large
liners could fill their rooms: take what HP\'s they can get, have luxurious
fittings, better food, and extra stewards, and a route, good advertising,
and a known friendly crew, and you can get a really good fill of the SR\'s,
at significantly increased rates... but also note that you cannot accept
millitary passage coupons unless you accept them at their face values....

Aha! But what *is* "Traveller Universe Technology" now? HePlar? Thruster
Plates? 100 ton minimum Starship size because of JDrive limitations? USL ships
being able to land on Terra-sized worlds with no atmosphere but not the same
sized world *with* atmosphere, even tho they have AGrav drives and can travel
at 40 mph?

I would suggest it is even more fruitless than it was before to argue about
FF&S Lite as we have no idea what Marc Miller is going to do re Traveller tech
and the changes that FF&S introduced. However, I would say that the signs that
are available ... restarting the JTAS from the last numbered issue
pre-Challenge and a few other hints do *not* sound too good for the chances of
anything like FF&S. *High Guard* style stuff *seems* more likely, on the whole.
But, hey, this is all idle speculation ... we won\'t really know until August
at the earliest!

Oh, and note that too much explanations for what has to be, basically, bullshit
technology, is what causes all the above (and many other) problems. It\'s
probably better not to give too much detail *unless* you have it both
playtested *and* nitpicked ... by guys like us on this list. That way we can
say, "hey, the USL rule doesn\'t make sense for these reasons" and the new
designers can rewrite the offending section(s) to remove any chance of misuse.
Unfortunately, seems damn all chance of that based on past experience! But
maybe Imperium Games are different!

I (and presumably *everyone* on this - and the sister - list) have been
complaining about this for *years*. But this opens the whole can of worms -
such a TL/15 version of a TL/12 computer would be *cheaper* as well. And that
brings up the whole problem of the severely disfunctional tech-economy
relationship in Traveller.

So, instead of naming them after the enemy\'s cities, you name them (or many of
them) after the enemy\'s other stuff ... Colt, Oni, Altair, Luxor (one of his
towns), Mjollnir, Locust, Vampire etc!

Seems like the cure\'s no better than the disease. How about Vilani (or other)
*versions* of the same. Remember the XBoat Service\'s symbol ... the Poni (a six
or eight legged riding beast) ... so they could call it the (gag :-} ) "Poni

The whole USL vs. large worlds with no atmospere isn\'t an FF&S type
issue, it\'s a worlrd generation issue.  Find me an earth sized world
with no atmospere and I\'ll eat it :-)  The only way I could picture one
would be *very* close to its sun in which case the problem of landing
might well be finding a non-molten spot.  Planets with any reasonable
mass will almost certainly have some atosphere, even if very thin.

More or less true, but the point of the post as I read it was as a
suggestion to the "powers that be" (Marc MIller, et al).  As such, it\'s
a basically sound idea.  HAving a HG type system does not negate the
possibility of a more detailed system.  If there is never a published
FF&S-like product, then all "new" systems added will either require MM
to have an in-house system for making them consistant, or they\'ll just
make stuff up.  It\'s important to add that they\'ll make an effort to
have the made up stuff be more or less in line with reality as they
understand it.

The latter case still means that somebody someplace has an idea, say, of
the maximum relative strength of meson weapons vs. lasers for a given
energy input.  Some of us would just like to have those guidelines so
that we can make up new stuff that is consistant across campaigns.

True enough.  Grounding any detailed design rules a little doesn\'t bug
me.  And if I can punch a hole in a pirate at a long distance with a
tiny turret mounted laser weapon I wanna know how the hell it\'s focused
(or I don\'t, someone else will surely ask).

This would be really nice to see though.  *sigh*  MAybe just a table
with size/cost discounts per TL above TL first available.

I guess this could be true, but I think that with the eagerness of both
governments to reconquer the Wilds, that they would seek each other out
quickly once these reports come in.  The Free Traders that would openly
share this type of information about RC/Virus agreements would not likely
agree with the RC policies.  I think we\'ll have to agree to disagree here.  :)

I agree, One thing that got lost in all the quoting & requoting on this
issue has lost the Black Curtain Society.  I think this would be the key
issue that united the two opponents.  I also see the guild as being slowly
diminished until it is little more that a small trading group.  The Empire
of Solee is a bit too far from the Regency to get much aid from them I
think, but I do agree that the war I have been refering to would be little
more than minor border skirmishes.  I see the threat of the Black Curtain
Society(BCS) arising as an adversary while portions of fleets are in route
to the border.  The war would be averted because of the mutual opponent in
the BCS.  After the BCS was defeated or at least diminished, an uneasy peace
would develop with the occasional "accidental" hostility (similar to the
US/USSR Cold War).

I agree that this would reduce the needed volume, but you still need some of
the volume to fit the VR equipment.

I have always had a problem with the 3.5m deck size.  Are we supposed to
believe that in the future they actually need more space between decks than
we need between floors now.  Some folks have mentioned using 1m decks and
2.5m rooms.  I like the idea of 2.5m rooms, but the 1m deck is a bit much.
I find it hard to believe that there is enough environmental and control
junk to fill up 3.3 ft of space between decks.  I usually draw designs with
2.5m from floor to floor.  This allows 2.2m(7.25 ft.) of room height and
0.3m(1.00 ft.) of height between decks.  Even at our low(comparatively) tech
level we can build airtight bulkheads on oceangoing vessels at less than 4
in.  What is it that takes up so much space in a Starship that you need 3.5
meters between decks?

IMO, this is the only way to provide the halls and other areas needed to
make a ship useable.

My opinions FWIW.

        I disagree ... the "dedicated" life support volume is the actual
machinery, etc. required regardless of how many people are carried. The
closest "direct" link to the number of people supported by the life support
system is the number of staterooms, and I\'ve always considered that only
part of the "stateroom volume" is actually the space available to the occupant.

Well the Imperium speaks Galangic, which is related to English. 
I assume that the Imperium has words for  a small annoying bug that
eats alot, I don\'t know what it is so I called it a Locust.  Also
Solomani culture has had a huge impact on the Imperium, so some of its
myths and words will get into the vernaculur.

 I could have pulled out the Vilani word generator from Cogs & Dogs,
but I can barely pronounce most of the words that get generated, and
since they are just nonsense words, they have little impact on me when
I say them.  I can\'t even spell most of the Vilani names for things,
like the SDB, I never can remember how to spell its name.

It would be neat to name planes, or anything else for that matter,
after animals that have been created for Traveller, but most of them
have english names, like Beaked Monkey, or Tree Rat.

* Represents the companion star\'s orbit around the primary.

Unless you visit Dekha system, you may be unaware that the Dekha may not really 
be a "planet" at all.  Traders who visit the system for the first time are 
usually quite taken aback upon discovering this.  It\'s the system\'s most 
well-guarded secret.  In fact, few citizens of Dekha will even admit that it 
might be true.  Even mentioning the idea will most likely be met with scoffs and
derision: "Who told you that?  Heh heh!  Of course Dekha\'s a planet!  What do 
you think it is, an asteroid?"

In actuality, Dekha is thought by most authorities to be the largest (by far) 
planetoid in the Naglee Belt.  The Naglee Belt is in close orbit of Naglee, the 
Dekha system\'s companion star, which is located in the habitable orbit of 
Azurite, the system\'s primary star.  Dekha\'s surface is virtually covered with 
impact craters, the result of its extreme orbital eccentricity.  As Dekha has 
trudged along on its orbit for the past several billion years, it has collided 
with millions of smaller planetoids in the belt.  It has been theorized that 
Dekha was stricken by a rather large asteroid, approximately 8 km in diameter, 
about 50 million years ago, knocking it into its current orbit.  Dekha\'s extreme
elliptical orbit carries the planet to almost the midpoint of the predominate 
asteroid belt at its orbital perigee and at its apogee to the inner extremes of 
Azurite\'s habitable zone.

The opposition to the "Collisionists" believes that Dekha is a captured planet. 
Its extreme elliptical orbit lends itself to this theory, but Collisionists 
believe that if Dekha had been captured, it would have been by the larger, more 
dense Azurite.  They argue that Naglee could not possibly have acquired Dekha 
since Azurite is within 3 AU.

Dekha\'s scarred surface is about 90 percent covered by manmade constructions, 
concealing almost all of its cratered surface from the view of visiting 
starships.  Some of the larger craters have been covered in sealed environments 
and terraformed into lush valleys and parklands for recreational use by the 
planet\'s inhabitants.

The planet features some 316 arcologies, which house an average of 150 million 
people each.  The remaining inhabitants of the system live either in Naglee Belt
facilities or in one of the two dozen Dekhan orbital facilities.  A small number
of people live on Journey, the system\'s only outer-zone planet, but all are 
members of the RISS or RQS and none are permanent residents of the system.  
Considering the frequency with which rogue planetoids approach Dekha, one would 
think living there a risky proposition at best.  However, Dekha\'s extensive 
COACC Sensor System does an excellent job of ferreting out threats from 
wandering planetoids and pinpointing their location for hundreds of laser, 
particle accelerator and meson bays to promptly dispatch the objects before they
can cause any damage.

At Dekha\'s closest approach to Azurite, massive solar collectors are deployed 
from dedicated facilities on the planet\'s surface to extract as much stellar 
energy from the star as possible.  Because of Dekha\'s particularly inhospitable 
environment, Dekhans need to take every opportunity they can to acquire and 
conserve energy and other valuable resources.  This is just one of many ways it 
is done.

The system was settled in the late 280s predominantly by belters who wanted to 
exploit the mineral resources of the Naglee Belt.  Mostly late arrivals to the 
frontier, many of these belters were unable to get adequate prospecting rights 
in the richer Liran, Starn and Deneb belts.  

The system didn\'t really enjoy much of a population boom until 688, when GsbAG 
set up its first shipyard in the system, primarily for use by the IISS to 
construct scout/couriers and survey ships.  By the early 700s, the shipyards had
become Dekha\'s largest economic power, having broken into the trader and 
freighter market.  GsbAG continuously funneled resources into the Dekha yards 
until it was the largest and most prosperous yard between Deneb and Mora.
In 722, it was discovered that Dekha itself was a rich source of radioactives 
and crystals.  As the riches available in the Naglee Belt began to deplete, the 
surface of Dekha provided new opportunities for belters and miners. 

The population of the planet swelled to over 8 billion within the next two 
decades as Dekha\'s immense shipyards and mining industries enjoyed the largest 
economic boom in their history.  It was during this era that Dekha\'s current 
government took shape.  Dekha is governed by an elite core of political 
councils.  While technically a two-party system, the ruling party of Dekha has 
been the Orbital Party for the past three centuries.  The Orbital Party got its 
name from the fact that most of its officers were drawn from the ranks of 
corporations that operated self-sufficient orbital complexes, many of whom never
set foot on Dekhan terra firma in their entire lives.  The Orbitals had a great 
deal more experience interfacing with the interstellar community since Dekha 
itself has never presented much of an appeal to tourists or traders. The 
successful economic track records of the Orbitals and the perception that they 
were more cosmopolitan appealed to the masses on Dekha, whose lives had too long
been subjected to Dekha\'s topsy-turvy boom/depression cycles.

The minority party is the New Party, formed predominantly of old-money Dekhan 
families whose estates lay on the vaccuum wastelands of the planet.  The New 
Party has traditionally drawn its constituents from the rather large working 
class of the planet, but has fallen on lean times after losing touch with its 
supporters.

Dekha\'s prosperous shipbuilding industry makes it a power to be reckoned with in
Regency affairs.  Specializing in military (RISS, RQS) and commercial (traders 
and freighters) designs, Dekha maintains a breakneck industrial pace, the envy 
of many competitors Regencywide.  The Industrial Affairs Council, chaired by the
Minister of Industry, is the planet\'s most powerful political force.  The 
chairman is often the invited guest of the First Regent himself to meetings of 
industrial portent.

The current chairman is Laslo Ptolemy, former GsbAG Deneb Sector Division chief 
executive officer.  Ptolemy\'s modus operandi of late has been to acquire 
research and development funding for Dekha\'s faltering computer industry. 
GsbAG\'s success in the system has spawned thousands of smaller entrepreneurial 
shipyards which specialize in hitting the niche markets.  Currently, several 
such yards have been in the business of constructing mercenary ships.  As the 
opening of the frontier approaches, the need for professional soldiers has 
increased.  Enterprising Dekha does not intend to watch such an opportunity go 
by.

While the resources of Dekha and the Naglee Belt have not yet been depleted, 
they are limited and strikes occur on a rather inconsistent basis.  As a result,
the economy of the system has by necessity become heavily dependent on trade.  
The system\'s immense manufacturing industries draw upon the resources of several
neighboring star systems.

The Dekhan people consist more or less of two divergent groups: obscenely rich 
and borderline impoverished.  The rich control the orbital starports and 
manufacturing facilities as well as the largest ground- and belt-based mines and
industrial centers.  The majority of the population works in these facilities, 
living rather dismal, uninspired lives.  Dekhans are rather astrographically 
isolated due to their economic limitations.  For the most part, the average 
Dekhan citizen doesn\'t see himself as a member of an interstellar community.  
Most are slaves to the system, bound to the planet by an industrial aristocracy 
that calls all the shots. 

Most Dekhans partake in some form of sport or other entertainment in the 
planet\'s subterranean metropolises and terraformed park reserves.  All forms of 
entertainment are available as an opiate for people who are otherwise 
preoccupied with the daily routine of laboring away in a factory or mine.  The 
government allows its citizens to roam freely and generally play as they will, 
but infractions of the planet\'s criminal laws is a definite taboo.  Punishment 
for committing such crimes is extreme and quick.

Dekha\'s police force is borderline paramilitary and has a fair amount of 
autonomy in enforcing the law.  Travellers beware, visitors to Dekha are 
subjected to the same laws as Dekhan citizens.  The police forces of the planet 
are slightly above average in quality when compared to those of other Regency 
worlds, though recently several corruption scandals have been uncovered by the 
media.

Because Dekha is such a small world, and it is literally covered with manmade 
constructions, the planet resembles a single urban sprawl more than a collection
of cities.  As such, Dekhans have come to recognize certain "turfs," "regions" 
or "territories" rather than cities, per se.  One of the better known turfs is 
Be-Esdee, a phonetic spelling of the acronym, BSD, which stands for "bonded 
super-dense."  Citizens of this region are, of course, employed in the 
manufacture of the high-tech metal, predominantly used for starships, small 
craft and military vehicles and armor.  Crunchtown, located in Dekha\'s northern 
hemisphere, services the largest core of mining industries on the planet.  
Lanthopolis Down, counterpart of Lanthopolis Orbital, is the planet\'s most 
massive groundside shipbuilding center.

The citizens of each territory have developed diverse personalities and 
cultures.  Many groups are dominated by Regency religions.  The "Willie Belt," 
which overlaps several Dekhan territories, the home of some 18 billion people, 
is a haven for members of Deneb\'s "To Will One Thing" church.  The Church of the
Stellar Divinity has pockets of followers spread throughout the planet as well. 
A schism has occurred between those who workship Naglee and those who worship 
Azurite as their primary deity.  

Dekhan territories generally range from rough and tumble to downright dangerous.
Most of the "nice neighborhoods" are in orbit of the planet itself, though a 
few Dekhan aristocrats (most of whom are entrenched New Party politicos) are 
daring enough to have established estates on the ground.

Dekha\'s identity is established more on what it does that what it is.  The 
system and its people are for the most part cogs in an impersonal industrial 
machine.  While wealthy Dekhans are prideful of their accomplishments, even they
cannot deny that life for the common man on Dekha leaves something to be 
desired...though few would venture to admit it in public.

     Classic Traveller, as presented in "The Traveller Book" plus appropriate
add-ons (Books 4+, Azhanti High Lightning, etc), however, is by my reckoning
one of the very few all-time great gaming environments.  Sure, by "modern"
standards the rules look clunky and outdated, various people have pointed out
scientific and logical inconsistencies, and so forth, but for the time in which
it was published (late 70s through mid 80s) it was light years ahead of the
competetion and still compares favorably to the later iterations.

	Actually, there was an article on this subject in one of the 
earliest JTAS issues, reprinted in Best of the JTAS #1.  The article, 
written by Frank Chadwick and titled, "Trade and Commerce," proposes a 
system of price differences based upon the tech level and starport type 
of the world the item is found on.
	An excerpt from the article:
	"For example, a player wishes to purchase a map box on a tech 6 
world.  The base price of a map box is Cr 2500 (Traveller, Book 4, 
Mercenary, p 42) and it can be produced on worlds with a tech level of 9 
or higher.  To obtain the price of the map box on a tech 6 world, convert 
the base price from local currency to Imperials at its point of 
production.  Consulting the table, a tech 9 world with type A starport 
has an exchange rate of .7 credits per Imperial, thus making the price of 
th map box Cr 1750 (Imperial).  The player is on a tech 6 world with a 
class D starport, which has an exchange rate of .40 credits per 
Imperial.  Dividing 1750 by .40, the player discovers that the local 
price for the item is Cr 4375."

	The system really is sensible, and I believe it solves your price 
concerns.  Best of the JTAS issues are not hard to come by - I 
recommend you get this issue if you do not already own it.  
	Concerns over size, however, are not solved by it.  But, perhaps 
you can come up with solutions for that portion.

Well, if I didn\'t like it, I wouldn\'t bother trying to tweak it, I\'d start 
from scratch.

As for playtesting, etc., I think that those comments prove one\'s like
for traveller, not one\'s dislike.  I think that many people who bitch
about the lack of playtesting apparent in TNE are mad because the powers
that be (er, _were_, I guess :-) seem to like the product less than we do!

Just my 2Cr worth.

You\'re darn right!

I\'ve played CT, MT and TNE since 1980, and I\'ve loved and enjoyed every 
incarnation of the game.  Didn\'t much like the RC setting for TNE, so 
I\'m doing a Regency campaign.  If anything, enjoyment of the game has 
actually _grown_ for me and the five players in my group.

The five guys I play with are adamantly against converting away from TNE 
rules as they believe they are the best yet.  I had an open mind to the 
whole thing, but as a responsible referee, I have to consider the will 
of the masses! <g>  Looking forward to Imperium Games\' background 
material even if I don\'t regress to their modified CT rules.

We were talking in the staffroom at school the other day and, basically, were
talking over some of the more recent changes that our glorious leaders have
applied to us ... and which we don\'t think are such a wonderful idea. However,
that\'s neither here nor there ... one of the "expert" consultants the school
hired to convince us with razzle dazzle came up with this gem (all too common
these days) -

The children we teach now will change jobs at least three times in their
working lives, and will be working at jobs that have not even been invented yet

At the time I thought, "what a load of garbage" ... but, hey, I like an easy
life just like most people, and arguing against the "wave of the future" (or
what our beloved leadership have *decided* is the "wave of the future") is
*not* something that I bother to do very often. Pick battles you can win, I
say.

Anyhow, how is this related to Traveller?

Well, the statement is, at best, dubious ... I\'ll tell you right now, that most
people (kids) I teach now are going to do the same job for most, and probably
all, of their working lives, just as they do now. There\'ll still be plumbers,
carpenters, office workers, lawyers, doctors etc. ... at least in the next
couple of generations. As for the "jobs that haven\'t been invented yet" ...
well, that\'s a bit more believable ... but I reckon it may be on shaky ground
as well ... sure, new technologies give rise to some new jobs, and result in
others being rendered obsolete ... but how many people will end up doing those
jobs, and will they really be "new" or simply "new ways of doing the same old
things"?

Like, for example, the introduction of the mouldboard plough, horse collar, and
three field rotation system revolutionised agriculture in the Middle Ages. But
there were still farmers ... sure they were using tech that hadn\'t been around
when they were young, but, so what? More *productive* farmers, sure.

Anyway, think about this ... in the 53rd Century (or whatever ... I haven\'t
got my Referee\'s Comapnion handy, <grin>), what sort of jobs will people be
doing? What sort of jobs will be obsolete? What "new" jobs will exist.

Obviously (I think it\'s obvious, anyway) there\'ll be (relatively speaking)
almost no-one working in "heavy industry" anymore ... as it\'ll be even more
heavily roboticised than it is now. So, more people will be working in service
industries ... but a lot of that can be robot assisted as well ... so there
is bound to be some sort of new careers that people will be able to follow.

One thing that I can think of, very retro, is that with a highly mechanised
and roboticised society, there may well be a *big* market for personal servants
- just to show that you are filthy rich enough to afford them!

Information workers? Well, if you allow for the increasingly sophisticated
computers that even the crappy tech of Traveller allows for, then there may
not be the jobs in that area that we might think! Of course, if you think about
it, "information worker" is merely a different way of saying "office worker"
or, if you get down to tin-tacks, a "clerk".

Plumbers? Yep! Carpenters? Yes, again, for the prestige value of having
human-made work rather than robotically produced stuff. Chefs? yes!

So, what are *your* ideas? I\'d be interested to hear!

	This is going to be interesting.  After the new Traveller comes 
out, we will have four different systems under which people will be 
playing, yet all will be playing Traveller.  Are we going to split up the 
mailing lists into four different ones?  Will the new Traveller be served 
under the XBoat one (since it is most like CT), or under the Traveller ML 
(since this will be the newest incarnation of the game, replacing TNE)?
	And are we all going to get along?!?! :)

	There will be some of this, but each job type will have only a 
limited number of positions available due to a very limited demand.  
Hand-dipped candles are still available in our society, for instance, but 
the number of companies producing them is dwarfed by the number of 
companies using automation.  Have you seen a hand-made shoe lately?  Not 
many buy clothing that is made without any aid of automation, either.
	All of these things would be defintely niche markets.

	See above regarding the "retro" jobs.  Regarding new jobs that 
may be created, from my experience in role-playing the traveller 
universe, I\'d say there are a lot of people in mercenary jobs. <grin>

Joe Walsh brought up something interesting in the last digest: what are 
we going to do with the mailing list when "New Traveller" comes out?  I 
would say that this depends on who is planning to buy/play the new 
release.  

If, like me, most of the xboaters plan to buy and convert to NT (barring
the possibility that it is a completely screwed up mess), then I would
suggest one amalgamated list for CT/MT/NT (NT is for "New Traveller", you
saw the acronym here first :-), and one for TNE.  My reasoning is that the
new release is essentially "what MT should have been", and thus belong on 
the same list as MT. 

If, on the other hand, most of CT/MT players _don\'t_ want to convert to 
NT, then perhaps a third list would be in order.  

There is another possibility of course.  And that is that _everyone_ 
including CT, MT and TNE afficionadoes converts to NT.  Then we could 
have one big list.  ("You may say I\'m a dreamer...")

I guess we\'ll just have to wait and see what Harold\'s "Quick Poll" results 
turn up.

Happy Easter, fast well, and all that good stuff,

hmm.  seems to me that the scout service _wanted_ to call it the \'pony

Your part of the world must have a marvelously stable economy.  I\'d line to
discuss this with you, but it does not belong on TML.  Feel free to E-Mail.


>So, what are *your* ideas? I\'d be interested to hear!

I suspect that, at least during the first period of colonization (the
Traveller universe appears to already be full, but I suspect that if we
manage to get out of the solar system we\'ll find things pretty empty) people
will be doing a lot of jobs we now think are obsolete.

Why?  Because (IMHO) the first colonies will be founded mostly by the
disenfranchised and dispossessed of earth, who are not going to be able to
afford major capital investments in the automated factories, farming, and
administration methods of earth.

That means that a lot of things will have to be done by human and animal
toil, and a lot of professions now in a decline (ferriers for instance) will
be able to return.

Also, many resource based industries are now dying.  The fishing industry is
dead in Canada, and even if it limps back to life it will be a shadow of its
former self.  Once asteroid mining becomes the rule, hard rock mining should
disappear as surly as nuclear fusion will finish off coal and oil (at least
for energy).

Will new colonies be able to afford asteroid mines day one, or will they
begin with planetary mining?  If a new colony can find edible recourses to
exploit they will certainly do so (perhaps even building a luxury market).
In the process a lot of jobs that can only be found in the history books of
a far future earth will be reborn in the colonies.

Well, Blaze, TNE and FF&S work well, but there has been a constant debate
over whether or not it "Feels" like traveller. Of the incarnations of
traveller, TNE is the most DIFFERENT from the rest. It does many things
differently, especially character generation and aging. It can be quite
fun, but it is set up for far bigger than life PC\'s, weapons have trouble
killing PC\'s (A fusion gun can hurt small starships, but a PC in Combat
Armour survived 4 hits from it, at point blank.)

The New edition (often referred to as T4) goes back to the old CGen and
Skill systems; making TNE useless for their product line without major
conversions. Every edition so far has been a process of forced conversions
for ships and vehicles, and the new one will probably be similar.

FF&S is nice for everything but personal weapons, as it has good design
sequences, but it can be overly complex. It also works only with TNE,
Twighlight:2000, Dark Conspiracy, and Caddy\'s & Dinos.... not with previous
editions of Traveller, and will probably be replaced with something a
little more accurate.

It boils down to something a friend of mine once said:

        "when I want to run epic campiagns, TNE is my system of choice; when I
        want to run realistic campaigns of traveller, I use MegaTraveller"

Its the TML nickname for Vilani & Vargr by Digest Group Publishing.
Vilani & Vargr h a system for creating Vilani words, by rolling
on a table.  It would be easy enough to convert to software,but
I don\'t know if anyone has done it.  I think on one of the web
sites there is a word generator for some languages.  But I can

In the last few Xboat and TML Digests there have been some messages
about what we should do with the mailing lists when the new traveller
comes out.  I think we should keep it the same, and let
people discuss Travler 4, on both lists.  Alot of the discussion on 
both lists is not about rules, but about the Traveller universe, as all
of the rule sets use the same universe, albeit at different times, this
sort of discussion is useful to everbody. I started playing Traveller
with the Traveller Book back in 1981, but now I use the TNE rules, and
the RC setting, I like it, and I think it works well with my current
group of players. I still find X-boat to be interesting and useful.
Now with Traveller 4 trying to cover a variety of time periods starting
Miliue 0, and eventually getting to Miliue 1200 and beyond, it
would be a shame to further divide up Traveller fans.  After all
which ever rule set you use, its still Traveller.
Well enough rambling.

Subject: Baldur summary
Status: RO

Lewis,

	Here\'s my Baldur summary:



Baldur\'s government, though classed as a Feudal Technocracy, could be better
classed as just a Technocracy.

The Council of Science runs all of Baldur\'s resources vital to Baldur\'s 
development. A democratically elected assembly runs non-essential aspects
of planetary life, such as Tourism (;-) , Law Enforcement, etc. The assembly
can also raise points to be discussed by the Council of Science.

Many of L\'Steich\'s Corporations survive in some form on Baldur. The largest
is the Hellenic Trade and Transport Corporation, which controls a large
slice of Baldur\'s merchant fleet. Ships include 2x 20,000 ton colonizer vessels
some Tukera Freighters, Frontier Transports, Bulk Carriers, and many Liners,
Subsidized Merchants, and Far Traders. Many ships were rated for J-3 and J-2
as it is impossible to make the Journey from L\'Steich to it\'s former colonies
of Bestor and Baldur in a J-1 vessel (unless you want to arrive with little
maneuvering juice).

Baldur has access to a large number of vessels due to the fact that both it
and L\'Steich had time to prepare for the onset of the virus. Many on L\'Steich
evacuated to it\'s lower tech colony world when it became obvious that L\'Steich
couldn\'t survive. Many evacuation ships didn\'t arrive, many that did limped 
into orbit, some could be brought up to operating standards and are used by 
Baldur today. Those that couldn\'t sit in the Mothball fleet, just above 
Geostationary orbit - most gutted by the Proctors for equipment to keep
Baldur alive through the collapse.

Their Starport is impressive. Though only C-Class, it had to handle the 
colonists who arrived in droves from L\'Steich every year, and service the
vessels they came on. Half-Starport, half-colony, it\'s accomodations were
huge, designed to accomodate 100,000 people, and originally built at TL-9, it

On a similar subject, there was a recent TV series about the history of
submarines. In the last episode, they asked a British SSBN captain how the
crew passed the time on patrol - apparently, his boat has a model railway
set up in the missile room, with the track running round the launch tubes!
Another has a Scalextric set, and I forget what the others have. Could be
nice and confusing for PCs to find something similar on an old SDB...

I\'ve played Traveller since it was first published.  Here\'s my take on the
different versions:

Classic Traveller (CT) will always have a warm place in my heart, but as a
game system I now dislike it.  My group (mainly engineers & scientists) had
to add so many house rules that it became cumbersome.  The wide-open universe
was a nice setting, though. 

MegaTraveller (MT) had a nicer set of rules (basically a compilation of CT
rules with a nice task system), but I never liked the Rebellion setting, so I
didn\'t use it.  The adventures were still nicely cinematic in scope, but the
constant background of war and destruction was depressing. 

Traveller: The New Era (TNE) represented a major shift.  The game mechanics
became grittier and more realistic (with the exception of PC survivability in
a firefight).  The adventure settings shrunk - players now save worlds or
ships, not entire empires.  

Traveller (T4) will apparently return to CT/MT rules.  The setting will be
the start of the Third Imperium, which could be closer to TNE in terms of
scale, without the pessimism inherited from MT.  (This is just speculation,
mind you.)  

I prefer to use the TNE rules, but I\'ve simplified them down a bit and made
some judgement calls, and I still use some CT rules.  

I prefer the TNE character rules, which are mostly choice (instead of mostly
random).  I used to like random, but now I like playing a character that is
just what I wanted rather than someone else.  

For example, I don\'t do much combat but when I do I use _all_ the damage
rules, including shock & quick-kill - so my combat can be deadly.  (I also
treat NPCs the same a PCs.)  I _really_ like Brilliant Lances (the rules are
good but very poorly written) because earlier versions of space combat didn\'t
feel as realistic to me.  

I still use the CT trade rules, where each cargo has different
characteristics and pricing.  

I prefer mainly exploration and trade adventures, with a few espionage ones
thrown in for variety, so I haven\'t run most of the published adventures in
any system.  (They make great background material, though.)  Strangely, the
one I\'ve most successfully run was in "Smash & Grab" (a set of TNE commando
adventures) - except that I ran it as a \'sneak & peek\' instead.  

FFS is the best set of design rules yet, although it _does_ have its flaws.

I really liked the TNE version of Hivers and Ithklur (except for Dave\'s
humour).  More role-playing advice and less statistics than previous alien
books.  

My advice to you is to decide on the setting you\'d rather play in, and choose
which game version you\'ll use depending on that decision.

For myself, I will probably still use Brilliant Lances, unless T4 contains a
better system.  (I heard rumours of a High Guard-style system, which I
_wouldn\'t_ use.)  Similarly, I will still use FFS (unless I like the new
system better).  I may even still use TNE rules in the new setting.  I will
almost certainly use the new setting.

Actually, it\'s a bit goofy, IMO.  Look at the example above.  The item
lists for 2500Cr in Bk4.  On a TL15 world the map box costs 2500 Cr, on
the TL6 world mentioned, it costs 4375 *local* credits, but converting
to back to Imperial the price is 1750Cr!  The 1750Cr price is due to the
TL9 world of origin of the product.  Chadwick uses the table as an
_exchange rate_ so the only real changes in price are based on world of
origin TL of production.  If you assume that the listed price is in
Imperials at the TL listed...

He suggests that the higher priced goods that you have to buy on higher
TL worlds might be more reliable, but it seems odd that a calculator
that meets the same specs would cost *more* on a world many TLs higher
with reliability as the only improvement.  Hell, take a pistol as an
example: An automatic pistol costs 210Cr in Book1 at TL5.  Using the
JTAS table we\'d get it costing 210Cr at TL15, and 21Cr at TL5 (in
Imperials----210*0.1)!

Why pay 10 times more for a technology that can\'t be improved all that
much?

You could use this table in a different way to some use, however.
Use the table, but assume any listed price/TL is the price for
manufacture in Imperial Credits at the TL mentioned.

In this case, using the example above, the map box is 2500Cr on the TL9
world of origin (use the TL that a given item is 1st available for
this, and assume the best possible starport).  If manufactured on a TL15 
world, the map box would cost 1750Cr (0.7*2500).  On the TL6 world the
imported price would be 6250Cr (2500/0.4).  All credits are standard
Imperials.  If the TL15 world didn\'t manufacture the map box locally
then it would be at least the price calculated for the world of origin,
plus transport and duties.  Different tables might be made for agro
goods, etc..

The autopistol would be 210Cr made on the "X" starport TL5 world (I\'m
using Terra of old as an example here).  On a TL15 world it\'d cost 94.5Cr
to manufacture assuming they were tooled up to make autopistols.  I
assume that it costs 210Cr on any TL5 world, regardless of starport, but
that you use the best starport on the table for the conversions between
TLs.

Doing things this way makes more sense to me.  High tech items will cost
more on the backwater world than the high TL world of origin due to
transport costs, duties, etc..

This would also be neat in that if you manufactured lower TL goods at a
higher TL facility, you would get a price break.  As you say,
volume/mass would be unchanged.  On electronic-type systems I might
allow volume to be traded with cost using the same numbers...

Many low-TL items wouldn\'t be made on high TL worlds though, so it
wouldn\'t be that easy to abuse (would Ford be making ground cars on a
TL15 world with few/no roads?  No.).

As an example, a Gazelle costs 224.44MCr in TNE (BL Tech. Booklet)
(I\'ll use TNE since it actually lists TL of the ship where Sup.7
doesn\'t).  This is the cost at a TL14 "A" starport.  At a TL15 "A"
starport it would be 213.22MCr (224.44*0.95).  

This would make a real market for lower tech ships, etc., made on high
tech worlds----they\'d be much cheaper.  In the case of Traders, this is
important if you try to figure out how Free Traders ever make ends meet.
You\'d have less capable ships, but they\'d cost less.  A good trade for
merchants in safe places.
Muir?
 
Anybody else with that old JTAS have any comments on this?

	Woops, you\'re right.  I was thinking of it in terms of your

	Yes, that would be the way to use it, IMO as well.

 Not "instead of".  "In addition to".  Imperial Culture is more
 than just the sum of the planetary cultures - but without the
 planetary cultures, there\'d be no Imperial Culture to be more than
 their sum.

thoughts (worth what you paid for them):

1) I would like to see the _current_ lists change as follows:
   * \'xboat\': same as current \'xboat\'
   * \'tne\': same as current \'traveller\'
   * \'traveller\': combined list -- one copy of messages sent to \'xboat\' and
      \'tne\' get sent to people subscribed to the \'traveller\' list

This would greatly benefit the large number of people who subscribe to both 
lists.  People who want to subscibe to both rather than the \'traveller\' list 
(because, for example, they filter their \'xboat\' and \'tne\' mail into separate 
mailboxes) would still have that option.

Adding a new list would obviously greatly complicate this structure.

2) Regarding a list for the next version of Traveller, I suspect that the 
volume of traffic will be great enough as we get closer to release that such a 
list may be warranted.  On the other hand, it is still only April, so maybe 
that decision is best put off for at least another month.

3) I vote for \'T4\' as the official abbreviation for the next version of 
Traveller. \'NT\' sounds too much like Microsoft, and \'New Traveller\' and \'The 
New Era\' may be confusing to the incredibl;y huge horde of new Travller 
afficionados T4 will create.  <grin>

Yeah, but those rules from Best of JTAS #1 mean that high tech goods are
cheaper on low tech worlds!  

the operative words in your comment are _low tech manufacturing_.  The
TL15 world could gear up to make low tech widgets, and ship them off
planet (everybody at home already has the widget) at a low margin, or
they could tool up for new technology that is still in demand on, and
off planet.  Since the tech is kinda new, the profit margins might be
higher.

If, as it seem so far, many of the members of the two lists are going to
"upgrade" to T4, then I would suggest two lists.

        CT/MT/TNE - A combination of the two current lists.  Mainly this
list would be for those few who refuse to upgrade and use one of the three
old rules systems.  Also this list would be for mileau\'s not yet covered by T4.

        Traveller - This list would be for anything covered by the new system.

Another worthy idea is to split the list up among time periods, like Rob
suggested, but we don\'t want to end up with 4 different lists.  At least not
until T4 attracts the droves of new travellers.  :)

While this has some merits, I don\'t think it addresses the reason why there 
are two lists currently.  I always thought the reason for two current lists 
was because the TNE was such a huge break (both in terms of background and 
game mechanics) that many people wanted nothing to do with it -- and, 
coversely, some TNE supporters wanted nothing to do with the xboat 
discussions.  If this is the case (and I think it is), I think a lot of people 
would be unhappy about combining the two now.

As I said in an earlier post, duplicate mail is one of the big concerns for 
me.  [Not that big, dup messages are just a little annoying, nothing more.]  
If the demographics don\'t quite break down as described above  -- if for 
example, the situation really is that TNEers like Xboat but not vice versa -- 
maybe one list could be a subset of the other,  e.g., subscribing to exboat 
gets you xboat; subscribing to TNE gets both xboat and TNE messages.

	Having survived the rancor and flames that accompanied the 
original split, the occasional bursts of crossposted TNE/CT bashing; 
I suspect that it will require a new list, or at least (my 
preference) a single list with some coherent \'Subject:\' scheme like

[TNE], [T4], [CT], [New Era], [Rebellion], [Antebellum], [Tech], 
[Economics], etc etc.  Yes I know that the classifications can 
multiply like rabbits, but it would be nice if everyone could hang 
together...

	If everyone could just hang back a minute before posting, take a 
deep breath, and ask if what you\'re saying is contributing or fanning 
the flames.  THIS IS A GAME not a religion, and we don\'t need 
religious wars here, surely not if the latest release of Traveller is 
to be successful.  I think Marc has it right, in that all of the 
various incarnations of Traveller have a place in the cosmos.

	As long as we can remeber this, and not rise reflexively to 
flame-bait: \'TNE Sucks and caused GDW to go under...now I hope all you 
pathetic TNE\'ers wither and die\' \'Get with the program you
old fogeys..or get out of the way!\' 

	What I\'d dearly love to see is Traveller open up, so that a large
plurality of ideas can be discussed.  What bothers me when words
like \'canon\' get bandied about are the dogmatic implications....this
is the \'One True Way to Play\'.  That does no-one any good.

conclusion that the TNE formula is flawed.

Each Engineer can operate, maintain, and repair a set number of engine
components. The flaw is that if the engine outputs 4x more power, the complexity
will increase by 4x also. Not so, the number of engine components will increase,
but so will their size. 

So a 100mw power plant, having about 100 different components will require one
engineer. The 400mw power plant has 200 different components, these being 2x as
large, would need only 2 engineers.



To correct ships already built. find the square root of the required engineering
crew and multiply by the square root of the number of drives.
IE a 2x 4,000mw tl-12 fusion power plants, would need a crew of 13 not 93!

Hey, could somebody who uses aol crosspost this stuff?  At least the
stuff that comes from MM, et al.

I think I know somebody who uses it, so maybe I\'ll have him dump

called, anyway?

    'body' => 'Hi All.  I was not around during the original split of the list into TNE
and CT/MT, but a recent post suggests it was somewhat acrimonious.  I see
no such trend so far in the discussions regarding NT (except that some
people have the temerity to suggest that T4 is a better acronym! :-) (More
on that below). I don\'t think it\'s something we have to worry about. 

Here are the possibilities as I see them: 

1. A completely new, third list.
	This is the most obvious solution, but may be unecessary if many 
people on one or both of the existing lists convert to NT.  Too many 
lists could result in thinned-out traffic and loss of oportunities to 
exchange ideas.

2. Include NT with CT/MT.
	My vote is for this.  The xboat list is somewhat smaller than the
TNE list, so it could handle the extra traffic.  Also, the rules for NT
are supposed to be very similar to those for CT/MT, so it makes sense to
put them all together.  TNE/FF&S really is a very different game system
and a fairly different background, and therefore deserves its own separate
list. 

3. Multiple lists based on milieu or subject.
	I\'m afraid I don\'t like this idea.  It could dilute things, and 
makes it difficult to know which list one is supposed to post to.  I like 
the idea of a small number of list better, for logistical reasons if 
nothing else.

4. One big list for everything. 
	This would be interesting, I think.  People would have to clearly 
label their posts in terms of which era they were referring to, and give 
good titles to their posts.  While I\'m on this topic, I would like to ask 
everyone to give good descriptive titles to their posts, and to warn if 
the post is long.  Thanks.

Are there any other ideas for how to handle this?

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...

I like the NT acronym for New Traveller better than T4 for a number of 
reasons:

1. "NT" is similar to "CT" and "MT", just as New Traveller is supposed to
be similar to Classic Trav and MegaTrav.  TNE is a very different game and
gets a very different acronym.  I think the risk of confusion is minimal 
(oops, there I go underestimating the power of human stupidity again! :-)

2. The new product isn\'t really the fourth edition of Traveller. 
There have been many editions of Classic Trav, and there was also
Traveller:2300. 

3. (Most importantly!) A "T4" is the income tax form here in Canada, and
it has very bad connotations for me, especially at this time of year! :-). 
I\'m not the only one, there are a number of Canadians on the lists. 
Please have some sympathy, we\'re the third most taxed people on earth (or 
is it second?)!

While I\'m in a facetious mood:

Top Ten Rejected Acronyms For the Latest Traveller Product:

10. T:TENE (Traveller: The Even Newer Era)
9. T:ONYARS (Traveller: Oh no! Yet Another Rules Set!)
8. T:TNTE (Traveller: The Non-Typo Era.  (I hope...))

Yes, but the article said to first convert to the credits (in imperials)
at the TL of manufacture.

The example given (in the article) was for a 2500Cr Map box.  They went
on to say that since it was made at TL9, the price (in _Imperials_, not
local credits) was 2500*0.7 (the 0.7 from the table given).  This was
the 1750Cr quoted.  only then do you calculate the cost in local
credits for a given world.  Of course it makes no difference since in
that system all that changes is how many units you spend, the actual
cost remains unchanged regardless of world (something costs 700 on one
world, 1000 on another, and the "real" price in Imperials doesn\'t
change).

So lower tech goods are cheaper if made on a lower tech world, and
higher tech goods are the same regardless of where you buy them.

Why are high tech goods more expensive?  Well, the article stated that
if the map box was made at TL 15, it would only differ from the TL9
version in little ways (reliability was suggested).  It would cost a lot
more though.  My example was a TL5 autopistol made on a TL5 world
without any starport vs. a TL15 world with an A starport.  The same
exact pistol would cost 10 times more made on the TL15 world!  What
improvements would there be, it\'s still an autopistol, mind you, not
some other technology.  There isn\'t much room for it to improve----the
same would be true for a revolver, and there is really no room for
improvement here, either.

Air rafts (as an example) will not be able to be made on the TL5 world,
but if they were, they\'d cost the same as on the TL15 world (in
Imperials, which is all that really matters; local units only adds
flavor with that table, it does nothing to change actual values of goods
as I read it.

Hear Hear.

my recolection of the split was that it seemed the only way, at the time, to
not have half the content of any given digest be inter-version flames  --
and pretty nasty ones sometimes at that.

My main wonder about this (non-xboat) list is: what are we going to talk
about while we wait for T4 to come out?  I\'m certainly not putting any more
money, time and effort into TNE: I already parted with all my old version
material.

The exchange factor was 1.00 at Tl-F A-port and lower by lower TL and port.
When you go to a world you convert your trusty Imperial Cr to local and you
would always get the same or more local creds for your Imperial.
How could that make high tech goods cheaper on low tech worlds?
I only have the original JTAS issue (#4) so maybe they changed it in Best of=
=8A?

/Backman
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I think the original idea was derived from the fact that shoes made in the 
US are more expensive than ones made in Thailand. Same shoes, same tech, 
different price. 

When dealing with stuff beyond a systems nominal TL; 
I always kick the price up. If some TL15 thing costs 1000CR Imperial @ a TL15 
starport A world than I would divide by .7 (for example) if that was the ap-
propirate multiplier for another world with a lower TL. This would still be
in Imperial Credits, btw, so the cost in \'local\' credits would be even higher.
This makes hi-tech stuff more expensive out in the boonies, even when buying 
with Imperial Credits, which is what I assume most Travellers will be carrying,
& is just the way I like things to work. It can get expensive out there on the 
Fringe when you rely too heavily on the highest tech.

I wasn\'t around when the lists originally split, but from what I understand
one of the main problems was the major change in rules.  (Yes, I know many
people hate the Virus concept, but the complaints I keep seeing are the
rules.)  I think most TNEers are planning to switch to the new rules set (I
am), and most CT/MTers will switch to the new rules because it will be
similar to the original system.  This means that those who choose to use any
of the old rules systems will be in the minority.

As far as the setting goes, with a little immagination (that\'s what fuels
this game anyway, isn\'t it), most information could be transferred from one
setting to another.  Sure, Virus and the RC don\'t exist in the year 1, but
pirates do, and the Imperium is rather small (compared to its glory days).
If everyone tries to remember to define a time setting in their subject line
it would help, but as it has already been pointed out,  sometimes the area
you think least capable of good ideas will spew forth some of the best thoughts.

FWIW, I think we should all pledge to try to get along and make this new
Trav system work.  I am anxious to see this edition of Trav work.  If we all
put our "cultish" beliefs about Trav aside and show a little tolerance, we
might just be able to work together (Yes, I do believe that CT/MTers and
TNEers can work together) to help Trav survive.


On another note:

I will label myself (possible), but I\'m a TNEer who will be glad to see the
return of thruster plates as opposed to HePlaR.


Also, I agree with Merrick.  Someone who is on AOL need to, please, post
Marc\'s comments here for those of us who are not on AOL.  If some could post

	Why should this list be any different from the x-boat...officially 
they\'ve had \'nothing to talk about\' for several years now...My 
campaign is set in the New era, I\'m not going to throw all my work 
out now.  Some rules may change here and there; if the New Traveller 
system is significantly better, I\'ll adopt it.  This is what I meant 
by dogma...just because there\'s a new version out, there\'s no reason 
to fling myself at the bandwagon.  I\'ve learned that the hard way, 
through several operating system and program \'upgrades\' in RL.

	Maybe I have a different view of all this.  Having started gaming in 
the era when the systems I used (D&D 1st ed and CT) didn\'t have the 
vast backgrounds they have now, and everything was up to the GM, I\'ve 
never been irrevocably wedded to \'canon\' in any gaming system; 
certainly not to the point of throwing away hundreds of hours of work 
because a new version of the game is coming out.

	As GM YOU are the final arbiter of anything in your game; I tell 
rules lawyers that they simply aren\'t allowed to practice in my 
universe.  I try hard to make sure that the rules I DO use are 
applied in a fair and consistent manner, but just because TNE says 
thrusters magically disappeared and became HEPLAR doesn\'t mean I HAVE 
to use it.

	As another caveat, I\'m more of a role player than a rule player; I 
don\'t get into the serious gear-head stuff too much...I go by Clarke\'s third 
law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from 
magic".  Things are rather lightly explained, I don\'t get out the 
orbital calculus texts to have my players move from jump point to 
the main world; re-fuelling tends to be more of the \'Oh yeah, before 
we go we gotta pop over to the local Exxon Gas Giant and Covenience 
Store  and fill \'er up...and get me a bag of Chee-tos while you\'re at 
it, Harry\'.

	For those who want a hard SF game this is anathema, I know. But 
what the hell, it works for me.

	So what do I like to see? Descriptive backgrounds, adventure seeds, 
stuff I can steal and put into my world.

	For instance, I LIKE the concept of Virus.  Not necessarily the 
mechanics of it\'s implementation, but the idea that humans, and other 
organic lifeforms, now have a serious competitor that\'s utterly 
different from them in needs, motivations, and behavior.

	So they\'re in my universe.  If you don\'t like them...don\'t use 
them.  But that hardly means that everything in my universe is 
useless to you, or vice-versa.  

	Another fr\'instance...Alvin Plummer did a nifty design a while
back, about these gigantic frieghters.  I don\'t have any of them
still in my universe (at least that anyone\'s yet found ;-) but the
idea captured me enough to write an adventure outline that\'s set in
the late 900\'s.

	Creativity (at least in my case) flourishes best in diversity; I 
don\'t mind exposure to new ideas...If I like \'em, I\'ll use \'em, if I 
don\'t, tough...it\'s no skin off my nose.  That\'s why I really dislike 
splitting lists like this, you miss out all the opportunities for 
hybrid vigor.

	I promise, this is my last lecture on the subject ;-)

The reason that the list split in the first place was because it was like
having a list to discuss Vampire.  Then all of a sudden, the converstation
changes to GURPS:Vampire (different rules, same background -- sorta).  The
background was pretty much the same, though most Spinward Marches people
could care less about the Diaspora sector. Now a new set of rules was also
dominating the conversation, and suddenly the people who enjoyed talking
about Traveller and the Spinward Marches (pre-virus era stuff) found
themselves having to read a bunch of irrelevent stuff (from their
perspective).  They asked for a list for them, and they got it.

While I think we should be one big happy Traveller family, I understand and
accept the rational behind the xboat list.  I also am open to creating a TNE
based list after the new stuff comes out, if traffic warrants it.

All I ask is that the main Traveller thread regarding the current state of
the game (shipping products, current "Era" blah blah blah) stay in
Traveller, not xboat.  This is not netnews, and I don\'t want to go into
creating a bazillion groups, when the overall traffic and number of users
barely warrents two lists. 

Oh, it looks as if the list move will be held off for another day.  We had a
bunch of other problems today and didn\'t get to it.  Remember, you should
not be affected by the move.

	Here, here!  I\'ve used last-generation stuff (Atari 8-bit 
computer, Classic Traveller) for quite some time now, and haven\'t found 
doing so to be a bad thing.  I find what works, and I stick with it.  
	I used to upgrade to the new version of everything I was 
interested in as soon as it came out.  But after years of doing that, and 
finding myself no happier for the expenditures, I decided to figure out 
which of my hobby items brought me the most happiness, and stick with \'em.
	When the new Traveller comes out, I am definitely going to look 
at it.  I\'ll go to the games store, page carefully through the book, and 
decide whether it is worth buying.  If it is, then I\'ll bring it home and 
examine it more in-depth.  Then I will decide whether to buy any more New 
Traveller items.  
	If I decide not to, I won\'t be "losing out" or "missing the 
boat."  I\'ll simply be playing the incarnation of Traveller that I enjoy 
the most.

	While I know very well that I am given to bouts of "old 
codgerism," I still feel what you say is true.  At least in my 
experience, the old-timers are better able to see RPG\'s as clay to be 
molded, rather than as statues carved in stone.  The idea that Marc 
Miller, Gary Gygax, the entire development staff of TSR, or anyone else 
can tell me how I\'m going to play a game is rediculous, IMO.  But, as you 
said, maybe that\'s a generational thing.

	This is much how we play it.  I enjoy hard SF as much as the next 
guy when it comes to reading it, but I expect an RPG to be less wedded to 
"hard" science.  I don\'t worry about how a gizmo works so much as how 
WELL it works.

> 	So what do I like to see? Descriptive backgrounds, adventure seeds, 
> stuff I can steal and put into my world.

	And even there, I bet you\'re as unlikely to take the background 
as writ in stone as I am.  Sure, I like to have a nice backdrop for my 
adventures, but if I decide that there\'s a race of giants on a given 
world, or if I decide that a given world has a law level or some other 
characteristic different from that given in the official rules, I\'m going 
to ignore the rules.  
	By the way, in my conversation with Ken Whitman, he also 
mentioned this phenomina of players and referees following the rules as 
if they were God\'s law.  He told me that the new system will be more 
explicit in encouraging \'house rules\' and alternate uses of the system.

	I, too, would like to see one list, as I\'ve said before.

Hi folks

I\'m writing a scenario (that I expect will turn into a
campaign) set on the world of Arden in the
Spinward Marches.

I would like to try and keep this material within the
existing canon as far as possible.  I have consulted
all the sources that I have at my disposal (Spinward
Marches, Library data, Regency Sourcebook)
that at least cover the area.  I was wondering if any
of you knew of any information relating specifically
to Arden that exists outside of these?  I\'m referring
to anything from scenarios to snippets of information
about names of cities etc. (pref. 1110 or earlier)

If you know of anything I\'d be grateful if you could
e-mail me with the name of the publication so I can
try and track it down (or if it\'s only a little bit of info,
perhaps you could just let me know what it is...)
Thanks a lot.

By the way, in all the discussion about new lists and
names for the new incarnation of Traveller, and in the
light of the ongoing CT/TNE schism,  I\'m surprised
that nobody\'s mentioned:

Traveller 4: The Empire Strikes Back ....
;-)

Cheers

Iain

Many tidbits on job offers, etc. imply widespread and more-or-less

out that "all companies named Arden [Arden Construction, Arden

All too true.  If we don\'t support the new Traveller, folks, there ain\'t gonna _be_ a 
Traveller anymore.  Let\'s stick together and give it a fair shake, or T4 will be the game\'s

As I see it, there\'s going to be a wide variety of Traveller topics
and discussions that are going to \'spin-off\' with the creation of
the new game.  This is a fact that\'s shown itself to be true with
the advent of MegaTraveller and then The New Era.   There\'s no
reason it shouldn\'t happen again and many reasons that it 
should happen, especially NOW!

This is a very different situation that the second and third 
\'incarnations\' of Traveller.  They were re-vamps of the original
game system.  This time, they\'re doing it right and creating
and entirely new game system while using the \'skeleton\' of
the Classic Traveller as a framework and adding various 
useful \'organs\' gleened from sources that have shown true
value over the years.  This very concept lends itself to a
massive amount of debat on a wide variety of topics.

For this reason, I suggest a version of option #6.

There needs to INITIALLY be a place for all aspects of the 
gaming system to be ironed out.  There just isn\'t enough
room for everything to be done in a couple of publications
and on a timely basis.  With a multiplicity of lists, we could
attack each problem individually and deal with them.  Then,
when the interest in any one list wained, it could be dis-
continued with no problem.

There... do I make sense??

Thanks....

	It\'s even worse than that.  If we don\'t not only buy the thing, 
but get lots of other people to buy it, then it will undoubtedly die.   I 
doubt there are enough Traveller players left to support a new edition by 
ourselves.  The new Traveller has to have not only us, but new blood as well.
	I\'ve been through this same situation with Atari before.  Their 
Jaguar 64-bit videogame system was introduced in a similar situation - 
the Atari name recognition, once great, was virtually unknown among the 
current game players.  The Traveller name isn\'t quite as unknown as 
Atari, but it is no where near as well-known as it was in 1983.  The 
Atari community decided to support the game system, for the most part, 
but failed in getting the word out.  I know, it\'s primarily the 
responsibility of the manufacturer to get that word ot - and Atari failed 
at that, too.  But we can\'t rely on Imperium Games and/or Far Future to 
get the word out any more than the Atari community could rely on Atari 
Corp. - small companies have a hard time when they go against goliaths 
like Sega and TSR.
	If we want this to work, we have to spread the word.  And, we 
have to do it politely.  Not by bashing other RP systems (this just 
entrenches the opposition), but by demonstrating as best we can the 
superiority of the Traveller system.  Politely show people how much fun 
the game is.
	There is no way Traveller is going to successfully win the 
"storytelling" games market, so ignore it.  Concentrate on those who 
enjoy true RPGs (in the classic sense of the term).  
	How do we go about this?  Once the game is out, start discussions 
in r.g.f.misc.   Write letters to general gaming magazines like Shadis.  
Write articles for gaming magazines that have large readerships (write 
reviews, system additions, adventures, explanatory essays on aspects of 
the Imperial culture, etc.).  
	Never, never say the other systems are worse.  Just emphasize the 
excellence of Traveller.  If you get a response that is flame-bait, don\'t 
take it if you aren\'t up to responding in a way that makes the flamer 
look silly in the eyes of the rest of the readership while simultaneously 
making you look good in their eyes.
	All this is IMO, of course.  But it is based on experience in 
similar situations - all of which were bungled.  The manufacturers 
dropped the ball, but the enthusiasts failed to recover it.  And the 
enthusiasts suffered along with the manufacturer.

	Two thoughts:

	1)  Would it increase participation?

	2)  It would definitely lead to the usual level of spamming, 
inappropriate cross-posting, and unrelated posts.  

	I like the mailing list format.  It keeps the discussion limited 
to posts by those who enjoy Traveller.  We don\'t get cross-posts such as 
"Magic: The Gathering sucks!" or "Christianity forbids role-playing," and 
other such topics as get strewn about the r.g.f.* heirarchy.

This effect might be explained by an example from our own time and world. How much would a 
brand new 80286 processor cost today? They aren\'t made anymore, or if they are, they are 
much more expensive than the later newer processors. I think we can safely assume that same 
relationship will affect the prices in the future too. Another example: How much did ENIAC 
cost?

        Says who? If it doesn\'t meet my wants, I don\'t have to buy it ...
I\'ve got my TNE stuff, and my MT stuff, and my CT stuff ...

        Seriously, there are quite a few people who are playing quite
happily with previous editions, who felt no need to buy TNE. Likewise, I
expect there to be people who chose not to upgrade again.

        And before somebody starts threatening to burn me at the stake for
not supporting Traveller, and hence condemning it to death: calm down,
please. It\'s only a game, not a religion. If it\'s something I want, I\'ll
support it. If it\'s not, I won\'t. Seems perfectly reasonable to me. If you
can explain to me why I should spend money on something I don\'t want, I\'ll
certainly reconsider. But my real hope is it will be something I like. From
what little dribs of rumors I\'ve been hearing, I\'m not expecting it, but I
can hope.

        Frankly, I think newsgroups stink. The noise ratio is incredibly
high, and there are too many morons out there. With a mailing list, at
least, people have to take the effort to subscribe. And even then, you
occasionally get some jackass who thinks everybody needs to hear about his
Russian Mail Order Brides scam or some such. I would personally have to vote
_against_ a newsgroup at this point.

have outlined below.  I check the text of each mail as it comes in, but 
it will be easier come counting time if everyone does the following:

Read the following list of options about the future of TML/XTML mailing 
lists, and send me email indicating your preference. My address is:

charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca

IMPORTANT:  The message subject line should be "Survey: Option x", where x
is the number of your preferred option.  If you have already sent me a
vote that was not in this format, please send in another and make it clear
in the body of the letter that this is a second vote so I don\'t count you
twice.  Thanks. Additional comments are welcome, but please make the
subject line as indicated. 

Voting Options:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New 
Traveller.  This would mean three lists, one for CT/MT, one for TNE, and 
another for NT.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.  This would 
mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT and another for TNE.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.  This 
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT, and one for TNE/NT.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.  This 
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT, and another for TNE/NT.

5. Create single list for all game versions (CT/MT/TNE/NT).

6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history, 
rules, etc.

7. Create new list for TNE, discuss New Traveller on Traveller, and leave 
Xboat for CT/MT.  This is similar to option 1, except that the TML 
retains its charter as a forum for discussing the latest Traveller version.

8. Other (please specify).  

Just a reminder: I\'m "closing the poll" April 30th, so get those votes in 
soon.

	Despite the plan I laid out for user support of the new 
Traveller, I agree with you.  I have no plan to upgrade to the new 
Traveller - and I have no plan not to.  I\'m going to wait and see what it 
is like when it comes out.
	But my earlier prescription stands: those individuals who buy and 
enjoy the new Traveller (whether I am included in their number or not) 
should seek to bring in new blood.
	And those who do not upgrade should refrain from revileing the 
new system.  If I choose not to upgrade, I\'ll be very happy if there is a 
place offered for the discussion of CT.

I think that you miss Phil\'s point.  Sure, we can\'t/don\'t make 286s
anymore, but take your generic $1000+ XT clone from that era.  OK, how
much does it cost to make a computer that meets the same benchmarks
(speed, memory, etc.?)  I bet a Newton can out perform the XT gathering
dust in my shed, and it\'s maybe 1/2 a kilo and the size of an
addressbook.  It is also somewhat cheaper.

Since the tech in traveller is grouped by the specs it meets, that\'s
what you need to look at.

So why would we expect a computer manufacturer on a TL15 world to make
a computer (using TL15 tech) that has does a fraction of what their top
of the line does, but takes up much more room?  At the very least you
could allow that even if it were the same price as it would be at TL12,
it should at least be the smaller size at all times if made at a higher
TL.

    'body' => 'My Cr.02 on the subject of newsgroups and mailing lists...

I\'ll set them up, somebody else can knock them down.

1)  Newsgroup: NO, please a thousand times NO!!!!!!!!

Sorry to shout, but...I frequently read about a dozen newsgroups, and 
between the spammers, the RPG\'s are satanic thread, the appeals to fight the 
Telecom Act, etc...the signal to noise ratio is ridiculously high...

I may not agree with everything everybody says here (thank goodness I 
don\'t), but at least the comments are usually (99% of the time) on 
topic.

2) Mailing Lists...

2 Newsgroups: 1) TNE 
(I know this is going to make somebody mad at me, so I\'ll dawn the 
asbestos underwear), Because like it or not, most CT/MT players 
can\'t stand virus or the changes done by TNE to the mililieu as well 
as the rules system.  Personally, I have no problems with Virus, but 
I can\'t stand Dave Nilsen as a writer.  Most of the later TNE 
sourcebooks looked a little too much like Dave Nilsen\'s personal ego 
trips.  Heck, there\'re are a lot of CT people who thought 
the Rebellion was a bad idea...

2) CT/MT/T4

Since T4 is going to have a rules system which is drawing heavily 
from CT & MT, with the addition of a lot of good ideas from other 
materials put out, the rules systems will at least be similar enough, 
to have intelligible Technogeek discussions, even if the Eras will be 
widely disparate.

I think TNE is just a different animal.  In some ways, it is 
ironically enough, the most complete set of Traveller rules ever put 
out, but they\'re just so radically different from what came before, 
and what is apparently going to come after, that the 2 are just a 
little too incompatible to coexist.  I subscribe to both mailing 
lists, and will probably continue to subscribe to whatever number of 
mailing lists come out of the smoke after August.

    The only way to attract new people, is to do something innovative.

    If the new traveller edition (TAT: Traveller Another Try?) should

stuff mixed around and warmed up.

          [snip]
          
          By the way, in all the discussion about new lists and names for 
          the new incarnation of Traveller, and in the light of the ongoing 
          CT/TNE schism,  I\'m surprised that nobody\'s mentioned:
          
          Traveller 4: The Empire Strikes Back .... ;-)
          
          Cheers

David, I agree completely - with one possibe exception.  If Marc Miller &
Co. were to run a moderated news group to deal with questions and support as
a semi-offical house organ, that would be a nice addistion to the existing
resourses -- but hardly a replacement for the TML.  A lot of web sites are
also now running thread-like discussions which could also be used for such a
purpose, but are likewise spam resistan.

Again, I\'d like to see this for the sake of advertising and public support
on the net -- the mailing lists seem to me to be the best venue for public
discussion.

If there\'s one thing I dislike about xboat/traveller, it\'s when people 
post to both lists. Ah, but I digress...

Perhaps we should have a third list: tne

xboat would remain for CT/MT
tne would cover, you got it, tne
traveller would cover the most recent version of trav, plus any 
miscellanous (sp?) traffic, like flame wars on asteroid throwing
and such.

This would give a separate list for each set of rules/background.

Also, specifying that all common stuff would go to traveller would
save me from reading the same messages twice...

The news group idea wont work for a couple of reasons.  First, based on the
amount of traffic this list generates, moderation would be a pretty much
full time job.  That job has to pretty much be done by someone with a Unix
shell.  I don\'t think AOLers can do the moderation thing (if I am wrong,
please correct me there).  This is a pretty expensive thing for a company
who is going to be treading on tight profit margins for some time (to
dedicate a body to dealing with a moderated list).

Secondly, the news group creation process is difficult.  Unless we wanted to
be in the ALT.* hierarchy (which I would recommend against), you have to go
through the buracracy.  When all the stuff is done and the votes are taken,
you have to have over 100 more yes votes than no votes.  If everyone on TML
were to vote yes, there are enough of the "don\'t split rec.games.frp any
more" people to make the vote close enought that it would probably fail.  I
have been involved in most all the new news group creation discussions and
voting processes in my 10 years of nethood, they are ugly and difficult to
deal with.  (Notice I haven\'t even mentioned the signal to noise ratio yet!!!).

Threading is a nice facility.  But what would be more help is if people
repiled with decent subject lines instead of :Re: Traveller Digest 509.

Sorry, but the pc was extremely lucky. If You don\'t roll an outstanding 
success You should interpret the shot as a near miss (for Plasma/Fusion guns)
or a bare hit(for bullet weapons) just touching the skin of the target.
And, as in reality, in TNE the most hits are of this type.(I have a table
about the percentage of people killed by bullets in WWII, and over 50%
survived HEAD shots. I know someone, who was hit by a bullet to the
head, the bullet travelled between his head and his helmet along his
upper head and left. There is still a visible scare, but he suffered just
a scratch wound from a head shot(something that almost never happens in
TNE). 

About the "You can\'t miss in point blank range". I know of an incident, 
where a soldier with a LATW missed a Tank at 5 metres, because he was 
so stunned by the gigantic mass of metal appearing just before him.
Another thing: If someone fires at true short range(ie below 2
metres or so) I rule an automatic outstanding success if the shot hits.
Also at this distance, weapons are usually pointed at the head. Also,
please don\'t cry if the system doesn\'t work if You ignore some rules
(ie sudden death). I can\'t understand it, You are saying
"Oh the pc\'s can\'t die suddenly in the TNE system, and we just removed
the sudden death rule..."
The sudden death rule is the most realistic approach to gun fire damage
I\'ve ever seen, because people die seldom of blood loss or damage
that adds up(if first aid is available of course) but of shots to
liver, heart, brain... Of course, there still is the 10 year old girl
that survived a shot into the liver, but it is not possible to include
that much luck into a RPG.

And if You don\'t want Your pc\'s to be so tough, don\'t give them 
battle dress.
Of course I don\'t want to say that You have to like the new rules and
they are great and glorious, but I don\'t think its fair to blame a rules
system for not working if You\'re removing some rules from it.
I, presonally never got along with the MT rules system and after I bought
the MT rules, read them, played one session,I threw them in the dust bin
(I\'m serious) and waited for a new traveller edition. We played Twilight 
2000 a lot and after TNE was out we liked it. The TNE combat system is 
much more realistic than the MT system(just compare the to hit 
propabilities of both systems with the propabilities to hit with 
real weapons). Of course that does not mean it\'s better (this is just
a matter of taste) but I use either a realistic rule system or use 
coins for random decisions(the most simple , easiest to use and the
only really fair rules system I know. Pehaps a recommendation 
for the new Traveller rules :-) )

Sorry of getting this stupid rules bashing stuff in here, but I could
not resist.

Since the tech in traveller is grouped by the specs it meets, that\'s
what you need to look at.

So why would we expect a computer manufacturer on a TL15 world to make
a computer (using TL15 tech) that has does a fraction of what their top
of the line does, but takes up much more room?  At the very least you
could allow that even if it were the same price as it would be at TL12,
it should at least be the smaller size at all times if made at a higher
TL.

-Merrick
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Out in the boonies it might be very handy to have systems that are lower
tech to allow for easier maint. & repair. So, a real T-9 computer might
sometimes be preferred over a T-15 system of equal capability.

Frankly, this is what you\'ll end up with anyway.  Neither the populations 
of Xboat or TNE will be able to stop themselves from speculating, 
which they will do in a vaccuum.

I vote for option 5 (one list), but I could not bear the resulting canon/
mechanics fights for the "one true way".  And certainly, at this point, 
there is no reason to split off another list for T4 (another vote; I document 
Windows NT for a living; if you must, then 4T).  There is not enough grist 
for the mill.

Actually, I\'d prefer this to the list. If nothing else, it\'d raise the

 Ick, no!, unless we go to a moderated newsgroup - and I don\'t know
 who should be the moderator; Rob has enough to do!

 Unmoderated newsgroups have a very low signal-to-noise ratio; the
 rec.games.frp hierarchy is probably the worst in this respect
 outside the alt hierarchy (and even perhaps within it, except for
 alt.sex.*).  I certainly don\'t want to see my favorite source for
 Traveller material inundated with the "RPG as the tool of Satan"
 thread, and the "points-vs-random" character generation thread,
 and the "realism-vs-cinematicism" thread, and so on.  Mailing
 lists are good; digested, you save easily 30% on nonduplication of
 headers; undigested, you get all of the benefits of a newsgroup
 without the noise.

 If the lists are killed in favor of a newsgroup, I guarantee that
 there _will_ be a list set up shortly thereafter - I\'ll do it
 myself!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
 Now, as far as future organization of the lists goes, I think that
 a hybrid of two suggestions I\'ve seen would be best:

 1) Broadly, there are two classes of list for discussing _game_
 _mechanics_: One for TNE, and one for !TNE.  The four systems
 _are_ two different animals; it makes sense to separate
 game-mechanical issues.

 This is where the minutiae of reality-checks in the rules and
 supplements (such as FF&S) would be pored over, and where the
 discussions about real-world physics, chemistry, and sociology
 (and any other hard or soft science you can put a name to) would
 rage.  Also, extended character generation procedures would be
 here.  No *.advocacy-style \\flammage\\, though.  It reduces S/N.

 2) Plot/Source materials:  One list, with a set of fairly
 well-defined subject flags, covering all games, since source
 material, written properly, need not be system-specific.
 Occasionally, some system-specific material will have to sneak in
 (for example, describing tasks in an adventure scenario), but,
 properly written, this will use descriptive language (a la the MT
 task system, i.e., "difficult: gun combat") rather than mechanical
 descriptions (a la CT, i.e., "8+ to hit, DM +gun combat, DM
 -target armour).  Such will scope out the "feel" of the task, and
 it will be easily translated into die rolls for any of the
 Traveller systems, and even into non-Traveller systems played with
 the Traveller background (GURPS:Traveller, or SR2020-Traveller, or
 even TD&D, anyone?).

 This is where discussions about the history of the various
 \\milieux\\ would be discussed, and where things like RICE Papers,
 campaign writeups, adventure nuggets, and session anecdotes would
 be posted.

 Fifty of these posts are worth a buck.  You\'re welcome to \'em.

A fairly obvious question presents itself.  

    Why not create a newsgroup AND keep the list going?

This may seem foolish and double effort on the part of all concerned, but
look at it this way.... Traveller has enjoyed a pretty good following in it\'s
years.... but game systems like D&D have been positively meteoric in their
growth.  Why?  As Andrew stated in his post, it\'s a matter of profile or
visibility... read that as good advertisement.....  The fantasy style games
have gotten good press over the years from various sources... but just how
much press have the sci-fi games gotten??  None that I can remember.... 
Maybe Andrew here is on to something that we should take a good hard look
at... maybe this is the wedge that our particular type of system needs to
slide into that sci-fi universe out there.... I wonder.... would Sci-Fi Buzz
on the Sci-Fi channel be interested in the New Traveller???   Couldn\'t hurt
to find out....  Marc?<g>

Unfortunately, they chose not to address this in Fire Fusion and Steel.
I started on some rules for making large damper installations (largely
based on the meson screen (MS) design rules in FF&S----the meson screens
should really just be a subset of dampers.

It basically required using the MS design rules in FF&S, then converting
the PV to a Damper Screen Value (DV).  You\'d get a certain number of DMs
to apply to attacks at a base level of Difficult depending on the DV----I
haven\'t followed through on the actual conversion (I\'d like it to
default to something like the turrets published for turret sized
dampers) factor yet since GDW went belly up.

The alternative is to wait for the new traveller rules to answer your
question :-)

Without being impolite about it - bugger off! I like the list approach, because

The list format may not be ideal for the hard Internet jockeys, but it _is_
accessible to all of us. The same is not true of a newsgroup.

IMHO a move to a newsgroup would be disastrous, due to
the amount of extraneous crap that comes floating into
every newsgroup which I read.  It\'s a pleasure to read
TML/xboat without having to wade through piles of
messages trying to get you into pyramid selling, telling
you that Satan is your overlord, telling you that Rush
Limbaugh is God/Satan or how the true destiny of the
world lies with the Aryan race.

In a way a move to USENET would decrease rather
than increase exclusivity. Many people still only have
e-mail access to the internet.  I\'d like to wait and see
what T4 (Travel Harder) is like before deciding how
the mailing lists should be structured, but I would
certainly oppose a move to Spam Heaven aka USENET
news.

I think that it would be very useful if, when T4 comes out and we\'ve
all had a chance to digest the rules, the participants of whatever
mailing lists exist work together to produce some sort of generic
Traveller descriptors which could be used in scenarios etc
prepared for the mailing list in order to make them system
compatible.  I\'m thinking about a common system like Jeff is
outlining above that would cover skill levels, task difficulty etc.
In my opinion this would make submissions more attractive to
all members of the list, whatever their chosen ruleset. Obviously,
there may be the odd thing which by its nature is specific to one
system, but I feel that a generic approach would be useful for all
Traveller fans, as opposed to TNE fans, CT fans etc.  I\'m not
suggesting anything complex; there\'s no need to rewrite the rules,
just a simple, elegant workable system.

This beats leaving it to people to convert stats themselves,as this
predisposes ownership and/or knowledge of all the rulesets, which
many may not have.

In my opinion (puts on blue helmet) this would help bridge the
sometimes silly divide which exists between the advocates of
TNE and CT (and presumably T4 when it arrives)

Any thoughts?

I\'ll vote for mailing list here. The knowledge that you\'re responding
to a smaller audience seems to keep people of the soapbox unless they
have something to say. It would be nice if the messages could be
broken out so that one could respond to them one by one. You had said
that you were changing from/?to? majordomo soon. Is that completed
yet?

I was looking at the rulebook for TNE recently, and came back to 
something that still nags at me. For burst fire of automatic weapons, 
they use the Impossible task level, if I remember correctly. The example 
states rolling something like 25 dice, and getting good odds on rolling 
at least a couple of 1s to hit. A friend of mine(who plays) is in the 
British army, a SAW gunner, and said that he found it easy to walk fire 
onto a target, even at long range, because of the relative lack of movement. 

I would tend to agree. Does anyone else think that this is wildly 
innacurate? As far as I can remember, the Impossible task was made, 
regardless of distance to target. If I\'ve managed to confuse myself 
again(readin\' those darn books - knew it would do more harm than good) 
I\'d appreciate someone reiterating the correct rules.

As far as T4 goes, a separate list would be my vote, as I\'ve seen a lot 
of infighting over CT/MT and TNE on BOTH lists. My advice would be, if 
you don\'t like it, don\'t use it. A newsgroup for Traveller would be OK, 
if moderated. Unmoderated? A big nono.

    'body' => '	I haven\'t weighed in on this issue before because I\'ve been too busy 
doing gradual student stuff.  As it turns out though, the project I\'ve 
been working on might be relevant to the discussion.
	A simple model like the JTAS one that Merrick brought up may be a
useful rule of thumb for game playing, if you like its outcomes, but it\'s
going to be hard for some people to suspend disbelief and accept it.  The
two examples that have been used here on the list illustrate the situation
well.
	A TL 6 autopistol and an 80286 microprocessor have both been 
brought up.  One would expect that an autopistol like a .45, the design 
for which has been around most of this century, wouldn\'t be very 
different built at its origninal TL6 or today\'s TL8.  So why should it be 
more expensive when built at a higher TL, as some rules suggest it should?  
For the 80286, people have said that for the same price we used to pay 
for the 286, we can now buy something many times more powerful, which is 
an argument for why prices should drop with TL, holding performance 
constant.  The differenece between these two items is that one is a 
"mature" technology while the other is not.
	This is where the project I\'ve been working on comes in.  It\'s
part of a study of technological change and pricing in the auto industry. 
What the study has found is that, in constant dollars, the price of a
domestic automobile in the U.S. dropped precipitously between 1910 and
1940.  From 1940-1975 the price was totally flat, but from 1975 to today,
the price has begun to climb noticably again.  The explanation for this is
that in the pre-war period, the automobile was not a mature technology,
and product and process innovations were continually being made that
simultaneously increased quality and lowered price. After 1940, the auto 
was a mature technology and little about it changed, so prices stayed 
constant.  Since the late 70s, cars have become increasingly 
sophisticated and luxurious, so their price has gone up.  
	The meat of our project was determining auto prices over the same
period for a _constant level of quality_.  We found that during the early
years, prices for a given level of quality dropped dramatically, and have
been flat ever since.
	What does all this have to do with Trav?  It shows that after an 
initial drop, prices for a good should be constant with regard to 
technolgy.  Your autopistol, a mature technology, will cost no more or 
less to produce in 1996 than it did in 1946.  The microprocessor, on the 
other hand, is still not a mature technology.  It is in that period of 
precipitous drops in price with equally large improvements in quality.  
Presumably, this will flatten out some time in the future.  That\'s not to 
say that computing technology won\'t improve, but it\'ll be  with something 
other than new versions of the 80x86.  For Trav, I\'d suggest that you let 
prices drop for 2 TLs and then hold them steady.
	This doesn\'t mean that all lower tech goods will be produced at 
higher TL worlds.  Some things will be replaced by higher tech (aka
quality) goods.  Other things will be imported because higher tech worlds 
are better off producing high-tech goods and trading them for low-tech 
goods from low-tech worlds.  On Earth, low-tech countries make clothing 
(a mature technology) and trade it to higher-tech countries for computers 
and such.  This happens because not making clothes frees up hi-tech 
workers to make things that only hi-tech workers can make.  This means 
that a TL12 world may be able to make ground cars just as cheaply as a 
TL8 world, but doesn\'t, because they make air/rafts instead.  These two 
worlds could swap cars for rafts and both would be better off.  If you\'ve 
had basic economics, this is called "comparative advantage."
	I apologize for this post being so long, but it\'s a complicated 
subject.  I\'ll try to respond when I can to questions, comments or 
flames. :-)  If this gets too weird or too non-Trav we can take it to email.

want people to participate, what I want is people who _participate_: who are
willing to talk about the actual subject (in this case, Traveller). The list
does that fine; much better than UselessNet News.

power to them.  However, this list will remain and as list administrator, I

a conversion from an existing mailing list.  As administrator, I have no
intentions on letting this list die.  I was not handed the reigns by the creator
to just close its doors.  This list has a long successful history and I think
it has a long successful future.

Here are my reasons for not supporting the news group idea:

Netnews is out of control.  A full news feed cannot be transmitted over a T1
without falling behind.  Netnews\' days are numbered.  Between the web, and
the total amount of worthless spam in the news groups, administrators are
less likely to want to carry netnews.  We receive a restricted feed of just
alt.,comp.,rec., and sci. (less alt.binaries).  Even then, as much as I have 
been a big news advocate for the past 12 years, find myself asking why?

So as diskspace becomes more precious, and so does bandwidth, admins will look
for things to eliminate.  News is at the top of the heap.  If sites stop
having netnews, then our group dies with it.  Mailing lists are more popular
than ever right now because they are not open to spam, they are low bandwidth
and they are effective.

I would like to ask a favor of the subscribers.  Please drop this thread and
return to discussing Traveller.  I have no intention of making any changes
in the lists or creating a new list until the new game takes shape and we have
a clearer picture about its make up.  Any discussion about what to do is very
pre-mature at this point.  Lets wait a few months.  If we let this kind of
thread die, and go back to discussing the game, and traffic looks like it 
warrents it, I will create a special, short term list for discussing the future
(i.e. news.groups) where we can rationally discuss the various options.  I 
like to think of this list as your list, since you are the people that makes
the list, so your opinion is very very important.  But my job as administrator
is to keep things in focus and maintain the lists.  At this point, there is
no need to change things, and there may never be.  Let it die, and we will
fix it when it breaks.

Thanks for your understanding

        Since there are still people out there looking for an excuse to bash
TNE, I\'m not going to go into any detail other than to repeat what I\'ve said
all along: I like much of the new rules in TNE and would rather go forward
than backward. Oh, yeah, and I\'m a gearhead.

Miracle, that\'s less than 10% of the people who read these lists (I had 
no idea we were so numerous!).  So this is a final plea for votes before 
I head off for sunny Florida for a week.  Here (for the final time, I 
promise!) are the instructions for voting and the voting options.


VOTING INSTRUCTIONS:

Read the following list of options about the future of TML/XTML mailing
lists, and send me email indicating your preference. My address is:

charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca

IMPORTANT:  The message subject line should be "Survey: Option x", where x
is the number of your preferred option.  If you have already sent me a
vote that was not in this format, please send in another and make it clear
in the body of the letter that this is a second vote so I don\'t count you
twice.  Thanks. Additional comments are welcome, but please make the
subject line as indicated.


VOTING OPTIONS:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New
Traveller.  This would mean three lists, one for CT/MT, one for TNE, and
another for NT.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.  This would
mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT and another for TNE.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.  This
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT, and one for TNE/NT.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.  This
would mean two lists, one for CT/MT/NT, and another for TNE/NT.

5. Create single list for all game versions (CT/MT/TNE/NT).

6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
rules, etc.

7. Create new list for TNE, discuss New Traveller on Traveller, and leave
Xboat for CT/MT.  This is similar to option 1, except that the TML
retains its charter as a forum for discussing the latest Traveller version.

8. Other (please specify).


Just a reminder: I\'m "closing the poll" April 30th, so get those votes in
soon.

Happy Travellin\',
Charles.

PS. I don\'t suppose anyone on the list is going to the ARVO conference?

Excellent idea.  There\'s _no_ reason why we of the TML should try to be

other forums that discuss the game.  Participation would be voluntary

Would you think (using your model of dropping prices for 2 TLs) that the
drop would be very steep?  One problem I see with this concept is the
relation of this to TL.  Some of these technologies change with TL, so
while the tool may be used for the same purpose it might be a completely
different technology----does this make any sense?

_Within_ a TL this seems pretty likely to me, but, hmmm.  Take power
production for example.  Power production would get cheaper once fusion
was common enough (we\'ll assume this :-).  Once damper tech comes
online, it\'s a whole new ballgame since they\'d have direct control of
the forces in question instead of the earlier brute-force methods.  So I
guess at critical points like these you\'d just assume that the once
mature technology  is not anymore, and prices will drop again for a few
TLs then flatten out.  Seems reasonable.

I guess the computer example sticks in my craw since computers have
always (IMHO) been broken in traveller.  The problem as I see it is that
once a technology becomes "mature" improvements will be small to
non-existant, the trick is to set the points at which a given technology
ceases to grow----FF&S devotes some page space to showing when various
technologies come online, but doesn\'t bother with where they flatten
out.  Once computer tech flattens out, the only difference between a TLx
and TLy computer would be capacity----you should be able to build a
model9 at TL12 if things flatten out at 12.  Yeesh, what a ramble.

I guess I agree with you, but I\'m trying to get a grip on it.  It would
seem that a some of the limits need to be dropped in a different places
for different tech.

I\'m glad to see someone agrees with me...  I think Traveller could put up a
real threat to D&D\'s rulership of the gaming world and I want more gamers to
pay attention to it!  (And hopefully some money to FarFuture and keep our
favorite game alive!)

Any others out there feel the same way we do?
What\'s the problem with having another venue for Traveller?  Is it expensive?
 Could FarFuture help with any cost?  Could a group of gamers get togather
and help?

Yeah, I know, I\'m full of it.... but it ain\'t brown and smelly.... it\'s
excitement I\'m full of ... this is my first chance to actually \'be in\' on the
beginning of something that\'s had as much impact on as many people as
Traveller has... Just count... I\'ve been doing some counting myself.... and
the numbers are pretty impressive... and world wide...

Let\'s get this thing going folks.... here or in a newsgroup.... either way,
Traveller is gonna be that much better if we foster an environment of
excitement and expectation for it before it\'s \'born\'.   It\'d sure help if we
had some \'press releases\' or something to work from... pictures, portions of
text, overviews, etc.... anything to use as tool to tell the other gamers
\'what\'s coming in August\'.

Well, I\'m climbing off my Traveller soapbox... I\'m starting to sound like a
preacher in a tent revival <grin>..... or a cheerleader... <those skirts just
don\'t fit right...> <grin>

As some of us say....
           KEEP THE FLAME......
                    with the addition of:         TILL DAWN...  (August, of
course!)

Remember, though, that under TNE, anyone with strength+skill of 4+ can
succeed on an impossible task, where under MT, Impossible was truly
impossible without AT LEAST a level 4 in skill (Specialist level), roughly
equivalent to a tne level of 8...

I used the autofire procedure as written, but substituted +2 DfMd instead
of changing to impossible.

So be it, the discussion seems to be senseless in both ways. Perhaps
rules systems depend to much on personal opinion that any discussion
about them is void. In fact, I think the only applicable definition
for a rules system someone likes is, that it produces results he likes.

The MT and TNE skills where selected in a matter, that at
a task level of difficult both produce about the same
propability. At this example we can see the following:

1)         Skill increase    Probability increase  Probability/skill
            at difficult       at difficult            increase
   TNE 12-14    x1.17             x1.17                   1.0
   MT   4-5     x1.25             x1.17                   0.936         
   TNE  8-12    x1.5              x1.5                    1.0
   MT   3-4     x1.333            x1.5                    0.88888666...
Note, while the Propability/Skill increase in TNE is constant, in
MT it is very aehm - weird.

2)                  Propability change
               from Difficult to Formidable
   TNE   14            x0.5
   MT     5            x0.24... 
   TNE   12            x0.5
   MT     4            x0.14...
   TNE    8            x0.5
   MT     3            x0.066...

Note while the propability change from difficult to formidable in
TNE is constant, in MT it is very aehm - weird.


Without 4th degree polynoms and a cray, I think its very difficult to
develop a fast and good conversion.
However, for role playing purposes just renaming MT Formidable into
Impossible (and let the MT task system using referees decide what to
do with Formidable tasks) and using the Formula TNE Asset = 3 x MT Skill
or MT Skill = TNE Asset/3 should be good enough.

I have spent much of the last four years as the science fiction editor for 
Roleplayer Independent (now out of print), and latterly Valkyrie. Both 
magazines being UK-based independent games magazines (Valkyrie is 
distributed in the US via On Military Matters in New Jersey).

In that time I have tried to publish in the magazines all the good Traveller 
submissions which I have received (regardless of which version of Traveller 
it is written for). Around half of the published Traveller material in those 
four years has been written by me, or specially commissioned for a specific 
issue. In that time, I have sent back, unpublished, three submissions (one 
because it appeared to be a direct plagiarism of Paranoia Press\' Scouts & 
Assassins book).

We are in the process of preparing a Traveller theme issue to be published 
in time for the European Gen Con at the beginning of September. I asked for 
Traveller articles and scenarios from a number of sources in the UK around a 
month ago - currently I have received one ship design and one scenario (the 
scenario is one of the best I\'ve seen, published or unpublished, for a long 
time).

There are other magazines out there which take Traveller submissions 
(Traveller Chronicle springs to mind).

Russ, you\'re right when you say that sword & sorcery gets better press than 
SF (hell, even Vampire got better press than SF in Valkyrie in 1995!), but a 
major factor in that has to be the lack of decent, usable submissions.

I hope you\'ll try to get hold of Valk\'s Traveller issue (God knows, we need 
a bigger readership to keep us going) - and if you do, I hope you\'ll enjoy 
it.

Kind Regards

I didn\'t mean to imply that once a certain technology was mature there
would be no advances _in other technologies that do the same task_.
But if we take, say, computer memory as an example:  At a certain point
semiconductor memory might become mature.  At this point there will
basically be no advance in memory density _with that technology_.
Optical memeory would be a new, and hence not mature technology, memeory
densities would continue to increase, but the technology would be
different.

Traveller usually deals with the operational specs of a technology, not
the actual numbers, so a lot of this gets lost.  We see computers
improving in capabilities (as DMs in combat, basically) but we have no
idea how/why they do.

Jump drive apparently becomes mature by TL15 since we don\'t see higher
jump numbers after that (do we?  I don\'t have MT handy so I can\'t
check).  Warp drive would be a different technology that meets the same
end----FTL travel.

If we talk about maneuver drives it\'s clearer.  Chemical rockets are
damn near mature right now.  Isps of 450 are about as good as they\'ll
ever get.  But Mdrives will continue to improve----the technology will
change to fission rockets, then fusion, then thruster plates if you like
those :-)  All are different technologies that become mature in their
own time.

Mature means what I wrote at the top by definition, with respect to
improvements.  If you get a quantum improvement, it\'d be because you
found a new technology that did the same job not because you improved
the mature tech (which you can\'t do).

Nope, real work has had to come first :-(  Any way, you can set your mail
options with listproc to ACK which will make you get each message as a
seperate mail message.  When we switch to majordomo, there will be two lists that you
subscribe to traveller and traveller-digest to determine which flavor you get.
Messages to either list goes to both lists.  Thats just majordomo\'s way of
dealing with things.

I\'ve been following the CD Rom technology since it was being studied.  The
first development gave us the CD Roms that we have today.  The second stage
is due to be released in August, the DVD drives.. they\'ll start at 4.7
gigabytes!  By 1998 the DVD\'s will be read / write and have a capacity of 18
gigabytes...   But this is only the second stage...

The third stage, the actual objective of all of the research (CD and DVD
technology were just a \'spin-off\' is the 3-D holigraphic storage unit.  The
unit is going to be roughly the size of a matchbox, clear crystal
construction, and have a capacity (at first) of 1 TERRABYTE!  Later systems
will range up to 10 TERRABYTES!!

Now, if these type of advances can occur on modern day earth, what\'s going to
happen in the future... a future with far, far more people doing research on
a variety of different subjects....??

This is more what I had in mind.  Personally I don\'t care about
exact equivalencies.  I\'d like something very broad and simple
that would not
     a)put off anybody new who comes to the mailng lists
     when T4 comes out
     b)clutter up scenarios etc unecessarily
     c)require the use of polynoms of any degree, colour,
     or flavour.

Broad, wide equivalencies, so you know if a character is useless,
average, good or bloody marvellous in any task which they might
perform or attribute which they might have.  It would give some
discretion to the referee, as rather than attempt an exact conversion
it would allow them to allocate their game stats within a range, so
it would be easy to  customise any scenarios for their game.

I know that there are many of us who subscribe to this list who would,
and could, do this as a matter of course, but there have been a
lot of discussions on the list recently about exclusivity, and the need
to open Traveller up to ensure its success.  I hope T4 brings many
new players into the Traveller fold, and that a number of those
players find their way to the TML and Xboat.  I wouldn\'t like them
to be put off by seeing lots of useful material in a form they can\'t
understand because they haven\'t been around Traveller as long
as the rest of us.

This is a very good point and a nice distinction. Just remember that in
Traveller ca. Year 1100 all technologies up to and including TL 14 are
mature technologies. That means that keeping prices constant may not be
so silly after all.

This is exactly the way GURPS handles it. Prices are halved at the first
TL after introduction and halved again at the next (And, where applicable,
the size is halved too). After this price and size remains constant.

_Mercenary_ has a rule that states that prices go down by 5-15% for each
TL after introduction, with no upper limit. The rule was not AFAIK carried
forward to _Megatraveller_.

0.  For me, the prospect of being there when it all starts gives an
almost unlimited potential for adventure.  I am going to explore a few
of the possibilities that have come to mind in the last few weeks.  A
copy of this is being sent to Marc Miller, in hopes that he might be
able to find something for me to do on the production of this book.

MILIEU 0:  The Sylean Federation was good enough for me!

One thing to consider is the birth pains of the new Imperium.  Despite
Cleon\'s PR campaign, many Sylean citizens are opposed to the new
government.  This opposition will range from angry editorials to
terrorist bombings.  An important test of the new order is their
reaction to this dissent; do they tolerate it in the name of an open
exchange of ideas, or crush it beneath the Imperial boot?

Many of the early nobles, drawn from the Sylean Navy and Senate, are
given grants of land in areas they already administered.  For most, life
will continue on with the introduction of a new level of social
interaction added to the mix.  There will be those, however, who find
the title an invitation to tyranny.  Some nobles will begin amassing
personal fortunes, start a little "empire-building" of their own, or
just engage in the type of anti-social behavior that has been expected
of the nobility throughout history.

THE SCOUT SERVICE:  The Brave, The Resourceful, The Short Lived

The transformation of the Sylean Survey Office into the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service is likely to be traumatic.  For centuries,
the Survey had only been called upon to keep the maps up-to-date and
monitor local conditions inside the Federation; now, they are tasked
with exploring the whole of the old Imperium!

I must point out that the Scouts have almost no information about the
area beyond Federation borders.  They may have a vague idea where Earth,
Vland, and Hub are, but beyond that, nothing.  Every system is an
unknown.  (I would like to thank Mr. Miller and Imperium Games for
making the decision not to detail the sectors, leaving that job for the
gamemaster.)

Many Scouts in the first few decades of the Imperium would be drawn from
the edge of Federation space.  Offering the chance for adventure - with
the bonus that if you live long enough, you get to keep the ship you
serve on - will attract the numbers of recruits needed for the huge job
ahead.

The opportunities for a Traveller group are obvious:  Seeking out
strange new worlds, boldly going where no man has gone... oops, don\'t
want Paramount mad at us..  :)

DIPLOMACY:  How much for just the planet?

One area of Traveller that I always considered sadly neglected was
diplomacy.  As a long time fan of Keith Laumer\'s "Retief" stories, the
thought of adventures where wits, not firepower, were the solution
intrigues me.

The Third Imperium is going to need diplomats.  As it expands, the
Imperium will contact many cultures that have drifted far from the
cultural legacy left by the Rule of Man.  Since civilization will most
likely survive on the worlds most desirable to the Imperium, skilled
negotiators will be in demand.

This need becomes more pronounced as the Pacification Campaigns draw
near (76 Imperial).  From what I can tell, the Imperium begins its
expansion during a sort of renaissance of interstellar travel.  More and
more, the Scouts are going to run into established, multi-world states,
some of which are going to be decidedly hostile.  Drawing the neutral
worlds into the Imperial fold will be a vital mission, and provides many
good role-playing opportunities for a thoughtful group.

(BTW:  If you have not read Laumer\'s stuff, do so.  It is some of the
funniest SF around.)

MERCHANTS:  Let\'s make a deal!

One group who will greet the Imperium with joy are the merchants.
Expansion means more industry, a better economy, and new markets.  This
is especially true for the free traders, who can roam the New Lands
searching for that world reputed to have "diamonds the size of your
fist" sitting around.  A clever enough merchant may find himself
possessor of a title if he persuades an industrial world to sign a trade
agreement with the Imperium.

Many of the "Classic" threats in deep space come alive again.  Pirates?
You\'ll find them around the smaller groupings of worlds with space
travel.  Hijackings?  How do you think the pirates get their ships?
Skipping?  Hey buddy, space is deep and dark, and the First Bank of
Sylea can\'t go *everywhere*.

One very nice thing is the lack of a universal monetary system.  PC
traders will have to rely on their shrewdness in business dealings,
bartering for most things found outside the Imperium, with one eye
watching for the Scouts with all their mushy talk about "protecting
native cultures."

THE BIG QUESTION:  Vland and the Pacification Campaigns

One thing has been nagging at me.  When and how does Vland join the
Third Imperium?  It must be a high priority goal for Cleon; gaining
Vland would cement his legitimacy as Emperor.  I imagine that an early
directive to the IISS would read, simply, "Re: Vland - FIND IT!!"

But there is no mention of Vland\'s joining.  Very odd.

I have a theory:  During the Pacification Campaigns, the Antares Sector
was suddenly offered membership in the Imperium as an Autonomous Region.
One has to wonder why Emperor Artemsus would set such a dangerous
precedent - unless he had run into a much greater threat, one that
required his full attention plus the resources of the Antares area.

What if the IISS had found Vland, and it was also expanding?  Since the
Third Imperium based its legitimacy on the previous two Imperia, the
presence of a vibrant interstellar society claiming to be the Zir Sirkaa
would be most upsetting.  Artemsus would have no choice but to deny the
that this was the true First Imperium reborn.  The Vilani would begin
reminding neutral worlds that the last Solomani-dominated Empire had
left us with the Long Night!  Both sides would face a series of border
incidents, clashes, and provocations that would lead to all-out war.

I believe that this war would mark the end of the Milieu 0 period.
After the conquest of Vland, the Imperium would settle down to "digest"
what it had absorbed.  The citizens will have been Imperial for two or
three generations now, and the borders will have been cleared of
immediate foes.

I am most eager to hear what all of you think.  Comments and questions
are welcome.

        How about just describing a character\'s abilities in any
specific area along the lines of "Unskilled, Beginner, Amateur,
Competent, Expert" or some such. These are broad enough
categories that anybody can understand, and then use his/her own
judgement to convert them. Or perhaps other guidelines. For
example, the MT "decoder" could say:

        Unskilled = no skill
        Beginner  = level 0
        Amateur   = level 1
        Competent = level 3
        Expert    = level 5

        \'Course, we\'d probably have to start posting a monthly
"FAQ" explaining why we\'re using word descriptions, and how to
convert them to the various systems, but that\'s not a major
problem.

	I wonder whether any RPg company (heck, any company at all!) has 
ever solicited major input from customers.  It seems to me that the RPG 
industry is fortunate in that virtually all customers tend toward making 
their own rules, settings, characters, etc., whereas typical industries 
(oh, for instance, television manufacturers or what-have-you) have 
customers who are far less involved with their products.

	Wouldn\'t it be nice if Imperium Games included their web address
(once they get one) in the new game?  That way, they could have links to
all the Traveller fan sites and the TML so that new players could access
all of the background, designs, and other support material that Traveller
fandom has generated over the decades.  I would think that it might even
be something of a selling point for new buyers, since there\'s the
equivalent of several supplements available free on the internet.

        Wouldn\'t it be nice if they actually talked to us,
instead of restricting it to those already on AOL? Even one-way

	I\'d go for that.  Heck, I\'ve seen three or four requests on this 
mailing list and xboat for the Marc Miller interview that occurred on AOL 
a few weeks ago.  If MM or Imp Games had bothered to log that to disk, 
then upload it here (even unedited), it would have been nice.
	As it is, since no one has responded to those requests, I assume 
no one who was there logged it to disk either. :(
	Hope nothing important was said . . . .

	I fully understand that Marc and Imp. Games have their hands full 
trying to get the game out by GenCon.  Nonetheless, it never hurts to 
drop a line here and there to the people most likely to buy your products.
	It\'s not like we don\'t need to be convinced in order to purchase 
them.  The number of Traveller fans who didn\'t upgrade to MegaTraveller, and 
the ones who didn\'t upgrade to TNE, shows very well that we aren\'t sheep 
who will buy every item put out with the Traveller logo on it.  We could 
be their core audience if they handle it properly - a core audience that 
could then go on to spread the word, garnering a larger audience and 
bigger profits for them.
	But, heck, it\'s their business - and their assets on the line - 
not ours.  If the worst situation happens and they fail miserably, it 
won\'t hurt me much - I\'ll still have my CT collection, and therefore I 
will be no worse off than before.
	So, in the end it is up to them, not us, to determine how they 
run their business.  
	It would just be nice to be appreciated as a customer for once.

Actually, I got a short response from Marc Miller to my essay.  (My wife
claims that I looked like "I had gone to see a department store Santa, and
he told me to take all the toys".

In his all-to-brief note; he suggested another effect that brought about the
Third Imperium\'s rapid ascendancy: the development of tech 12.. I\'m mulling
that one over.  Any gearheads want to break down the advantages of TL12 over
TL11?  He mentioned something about improved power sources...

In a word, _dampers_.  Nuclear damper tech implies the ability to
manipulate the strong and weak forces directly.  Big leap.  Like gaining
the use of stuff that involves the electromagnetic forces.

I think this is a good idea. Using the Difficult difficulty level as 
the conversion basis, this would give the following conversion.
I somehow adjusted the above given numbers, because there is a
extreme difference between skill level 3 and 5(reducing the chance for
a success for a difficult task by about x0.57 and giving the competent
man a chance of about 40% to succeed at a difficult task. Here is my
recommendation:
                                              Success(MT/TNE)
Description    MT Skill   TNE Asset   Routine*   Difficult   Impossible**
Novice             0          2       58%/20%      8%/10%       0%/ 0%
Beginner           1          4       72%/40%     17%/20%       0%/ 5%          
Amateur            2          6       83%/60%     28%/30%       0%/ 5%
Average            3          8       91%/80%     42%/40%       3%/10%
Competent          4         12       97%/90%     58%/60%       8%/15%
Expert             5         14       97%/90%     72%/70%      17%/15%
Wizard             6         16       97%/90%     83%/80%      28%/20%

*  TNE Average, I assume in the new system the difficulty level Routine
   will be used again. 
** Impossible is the impossible difficulty level in TNE
   or the Formidable difficulty level in the newer editions of MT. However
   IMHO this should be renamed to Almost Impossible :-)

The biggest problem is the 7+ /8+ gap at Difficult with an MT skill of
3/4. The granularity at this point is about 17%. This is the cause why I
don\'t like those gauss systems because they only work well within the ends
of the curve. At the center, there are large leaps in the odds. Also I
think a rule 12+ is allways success for the MT system would be nice. 
Also a problem is, that in MT the diffenent skills at routine tasks don\'t
make much difference, while in TNE low skilled characters have difficulties
with them. I think the greatest problem with the MT system is a missing
intermediate level between Difficult and Formidable/Impossible(ie. 13+)
This is because, while the random number production follows a gauss curve,
but the difficulty scale is linear.

 I appreciate that doubtless everyone is very busy preparing
what is hopefully going to be an excellent game, but it does
concern me that there is so little feedback to what must be one of
the most active user groups of a product.  In view of the apparently
error-strewn (I\'ve never seen it) MegaTraveller, the controversy
over the move to TNE, and the winding down of GDW, the market
place reputation of Traveller and Traveller products, among the
general RPG buying public as well as amongst retailers, cannot
be very high.  If T4 is to be the success we all hope it will be I
would have thought that good PR and marketing would be one
of the highest priorities on Imperium Games\' list.  There\'s not
much point in releasing a brilliant game if nobody buys it because
they mistrust its reputation and have had bad experiences with
its antecedents.

Apart from anything else, I\'m sure that many many members of
the TML and Xboat lists have e-mailed Marc Miller/ Imperium
Games with their suggestions, as requested.  To me it would
just be common courtesy to post some kind of reply to us as a
group, even if all that says is this is where we are.

Imperium Games is certainly very busy at the moment. I believe that Ken
(Whitman) is nearly finished equipping the IG office with telephones, etc.
and hopefully that, plus finalising contracts with authors and all that
stuff, will eventually leave him with enough time to read the huge number of
e-mails being sent to IG.

Basically, YES, they\'re very (I was going to use a stronger word here, but
I\'m not sure what your US regulations are like now?) busy. August really
isn\'t very far away. Yes, they\'re working hard, trying out various rules
alterations (from the CT and MT basis). Ken also has a lot of irons in the
fire to help finance Traveller in the longer-term.

Ok, I agree that limiting the discussions to AOL has shut out a lot of
people (including myself). I\'ve been trying to get some form of listing of
what was said (anyone out there record the AOL discussions?).

Needless to say, as one humbly hopes to be the \'vehicle\' for the UK launch
of the new Traveller, I have been keeping in touch with Ken as much as
possible. If I get any further news that I can share with you (yuck yuck
yuck - broke into corporate speech there for a second) I\'ll do so.

Oh, and no I have no formal connection with IG, in case anyone\'s wondering.

Well, it\'s a UK-based magazine. You should be able to find it in WH Smiths 
or John Menzies. Failing that, your newsagent or games shop should be able 
to get hold of it for you (issue 11 is due out in a couple of weeks).

Failing all of these try Leisure Games on 0181-346-2327 (+44 181 346 2327 
from outside the UK), or Caliver Books on 01702-73986 (+44 1702 73986 from 
outside the UK).

You can get back issues (the ones we still have copies of, at any rate) from 
Caliver Books.

The US distributor is On Military Matters, based in New Jersey. I don\'t have 
their number handy.

Hope this helps,

As an ex-usenet adminstrator (currently resting between jobs) I completely 
agree with you. Netnews is going down fast. The restricted feed my site 
took and held for 3 days was 2 gigs (or more) in sites and that didn\'t 
include the binary newsgroups. The feeling was the same between news 
administors that I dealt with. Also newsgroup messages can get lost. You 
could miss some if the site expired them before you had a chnace to log on.

A mailing list is a far better idea.

  I just acquired a copy of the May 1996 Computer Shopper (Metro NY
  Edition) and saw an article in the Tech Section about holographic
  data storage (Title: Light Waves Ahead; p562).

  The article says that Stanford University\'s Center for Nonlinear
  Optical Materials has "a 100 percent working holographic storage
  prototype."  The article then claims that the technology is
  viable enough to be on the market within five years.

  In June 1994, when the first tests of the technology were run,
  the Stanford system successfully encoded, stored, and retrieved a
  JPEG image of the Mona Lisa (originally stored on a conventional
  hard disk), and passed the tests with flying colors.  It is
  claimed that technological improvements have been made, and that
  this year, an MPEG sequence successfully passed the tests.

  The 2cm x 2cm x 1cm holocrystal is made out of Lithium Niobate,
  and the read-write mechanism is based on a blue-green Argon
  laser.  Work is in progress to try to achieve a system which will
  operate using a common red semiconductor laser - much cheaper and
  more available.

  The article then goes into the technical details of how the
  system works - a fascinating read, but too long and complex to
  summarize here - go get a copy of Computer Shopper and read it
  yourself.  Near the end, the claim is made that a consumer
  product (remember, we\'re talking less than five years) will
  exhibit a transfer rate of 1Gbps - yes, that\'s one gigabit per
  second - not too shabby!

  FWIW, the Megatraveller Referee\'s Companion puts holocrystal
  storage at TL13.

	True.  However, the Grand Survey/Census rules make it clear that 
technology levels in the different fields (computers, water 
transportation, personal weaponry, etc.) may not be the same on a given 
world.  That is, a world may have TL 13 computer storage, but only TL 8 
ground transportation.  
	Which makes sense.  In a war-oriented world, there will be 
relatively more advances in military technology than in other fields 
(ignoring for the moment the significant crossover of tech from one 
purpose to another).  A species which is water-dwelling will have far 
greater watercraft technology than ground transportation.  And so on.

	So, Earth at this point may indeed have TL 13 computers, but 
remain at TL 9 for other things.

	Ooh.  Even I, a Classic Traveller enthusiast, like this!  I like 
it a lot.  It sounds much better to say, "I\'m an expert computer 
programmer," than, "I have 5 skill levels of computer programming."  This 
one I\'m definitely going to save.

I spent some time as a machine gunner. 

A few things about machine guns that RPGs never seem to take into account: 
1. You aim at the BASE (feet) of your target if you are firing on a human or a 
group of humans. The bullet chucker throws an elongated cone of fire; rounds in 
the top half of the cone will strike the target, the ones in the bottom half of 
the cone ricochet off the ground and bring up stones, splinters etc which will 
cause your target some concern. 
2. A machine gun is more lethal than anything. 155mm Artillery, flamethrowers, 
mortars, rifle fire, anything. Millions of dead in hundreds of wars this century
can\'t be wrong. 
3. It is actually easier to hit a target that is some distance from you, because
you can walk fire onto it. 
4. If you are within the beaten zone of a machine gun, you are dead. Your 
commanding officer is dead. Your mates are dead. Your ... you get the point. 
5. An MG round will travel through a large tree, a wall, and half a dozen of 
your mates. There is very little that will protect you from machine gun fire. 
6. Body armour? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ... forget it. You are better off being 
able to run fast and fit into small depressions in the ground. 
7. When you are talking about automatic fire, it is always better to give than 
to receive. 

I am working on some alternate (highly lethal but simple) rules for automatic 
weapons combat; I will be posting them for comment sometime I can find time to 
finish them off.

Don, just a friendly suggestion.... it\'d sure be nice if the folks involved
in the creation of the newest version of Traveller would take a few minutes
each week to check out the lists and answer some question... or maybe you
could supply us with specific \'mail drops\' for each individual... (is
FarFuture@aol.com the only point of contact??)  You know, this list could be
a really valuable resource to FarFuture... you could skip possible errors by
checking on questionable things... and get suggestions... all by just
dropping a note...

Don\'t think for an instant that I\'m "busting your chops" about ANYTHING!!
 I\'m just trying to say that the people that read this list are the ones that
you might consider the \'deciples\' of Traveller... we\'re the ones that have
taken it to heart... and we\'re the ones that are going to be shaking up the
gaming community and letting them know about the new game system...  a
valuable resource if you ask me...  You folks are working as hard and as fast
as is humanly possible.... LET US HELP if we can.... create rules for ships
and let us know what they are..... I guarentee that you\'ll have more ship
designs drawn up than you can ever use....  give us ANY rules... and we\'ll
take \'em apart and put \'em back togather again.... and let you know if
they\'ve got holes anywhere.... with you guys working and us \'proofing\' ...
the new Traveller will have the least \'errata\' of any game that\'s come out in
recent years.....

=======================>  Just a friendly suggestion....

This presupposes that IG keeps their promise to issue \'Traveller IV: The

computer-technology allowed me to create a mucho-detailed spreadsheet

keeps on coming up - the amount of fuel for thrust.  Everything works 
fine for a 1G ship (like the Moraine-class Free Trader), but I always 
seem to get ridiculous answers like 6000 kl of thrust-fuel for the 
Patrol Cruiser... Okay, this may be pathetic, but I checked out the 
spreadsheet and the formula in the book and everything seems correct.

With the Patrol Cruiser you have a 400 ton vessel going at 4G which 
therefore requires 800 MW of thrust-MW.  According to the book, each 
thrust-MW requires 0.25 kl per hour, thus going for 200 kl of fuel 
per hour the entire assembly.  With 30 G-hour of thrust required that 
comes up to a rather hefty 6000 kl.  Now the only problem is that a 
400-ton hull only has 5,600 kl of volume left in it.  Umm... this may 
be a silly question but what am I doing wrong.  Everything else works 
out just peacy, but this one has got me stumped.  The only thing that 
I can do is divide the kl/hour for the assembly by four for >1G

Oh yes, a point on the technology... using the MT Referee\'s Companion

Just a thought.

	Thank you for participating.  It\'s nice to see a member of the 
design team here.
	I hope that we, the end-users, are allowed a chance to 
give input during the design process.  Now, truly, I\'m no fan of 
"design by committee," and I don\'t want that.  But, if your design team 
is having trouble on any point, please throw it out to us.  If you need 
ship designs, let us know the rules and we\'ll give \'em to you.  If you 
need other rules (character classes, experience rules, weapons, etc.), 
please let us know.  There will probably be one or more of us who has 
already developed a rule and smoothly integrated it with one of the three 
Traveller systems.  
	But most of all, I was hoping you\'d acknowledge us, which you\'ve 
done.  That\'s good.  And if the AOL discussions will be posted here soon, 
then I\'ll be content even if we never get a crack at designing ships 
and/or proofing rules systems.

Thanks,

-Joe

	Hmmm.  This is something rarely (if ever) seen in RPG\'s.  Sure, a 
direct hit by some other weapons will do more damage, but the accuracy 
isn\'t there as it is with a machine gun.  hmm.

	Simple and deadly: exactly the type of combat rules I like.  I look

Your problem is that the ship needs 200 kiloliters of fuel/hour, but 
that\'s at an acceleration of 4Gs.  So for every hour the ship 
accelerates at 4Gs(every 200 kl of fuel it burns) it produces 4 
G-hours of acceleration, not one.  So, to get 30 G-hours of 
acceleration, you only need 7 and 1/2 hours of fuel.
Hope that helps.

Almost all realworld(tm) processes if random are gaussian and therefore the
tasksystems should do that as well IMHO. One problem with the MT tasksystem
was how uncertain tasks where handled. A tasksystem should have the same
levels of success wether the task is uncertain or not. I do not use MT
rules in my campaign but the tasksystems are sligtly similar. An uncertain
task is handled exactly like a normal one with the same difficulty levels,
diemods et c but the player only rolls one die and the GM rolls the other
secretly. Only the GM knows the real outcome but the player has a rough
estimate because he knows what his die resulted in.
Also I hate automatic sucess/failure like MT, TNE et c. In my system if the
player rolls a natural 12 or a natural 1 he rolls another and adds the
result unless it was a six. If it was a six he adds 5 and rolls another die
et c. The same goes for snakeeys of course. Thus the players can succeed at
any task but the harder the task the less likely it is and they can also
fail at any task but the easier the task the less likely they are to fail.

Many statisticians would like you to believe that most real
world random processes are gaussian.  Unfortunately, this just isn\'t
true.

Rather than chanting wierdo maths here which nobody understands, I\'ll
mention, without proof, that averages and sums of things will often
tend towards the gaussian (the central limit theorem usually applies for
large enough samples).

But games rarely average or sum enough things for this to come into
play.

Updates on how the product is coming would be nice.  The automatic reaction
when I say "GenCon release" is for the person to respond "nice Christmas
present".  Are things on a schedule that y\'all are happy with?

Hints about what is going to be in T4 would help us get ready for the
transistion.  For example, since your forte is stsrships, are we going to be
using vector/thrust (TNE) or thrusters (CT/MT)?  Little things like that
will keep us going until the rules fall into our hands.

I remember Imperium Games announcing a mailing list.  I subscribed, but as
of yet haven\'t recieved a thing from them.

One thought just came to me.  A semi-regular IRC wouldn\'t hurt..

I\'m assuming ship design will hail back to High Guard, but sequences for

Also, what kind of schedule can we expect for the release of milieus?  
Personally, I\'m not planning on conducting a "New Traveller" campaign

Well, as I think that Joe Walsh has already said in another post,the fact
that somebody involved in the production of the new Traveller has actually
contacted this list is a good start!  My real concern is that we were 
contacted
at the time of GDW\'s demise, told what some outline plans were, asked for
our comments (and I\'m sure many of us replied in more detail than you
ever wanted...!) and then.... nothing.  All we heard were rumours that 
people with access to the discussions on AOL posted.

Speaking personally, I would be happy enough just hearing the odd
snippet of information about how things are coming along, any
exciting developments, any nailbiting problems etc.  I don\'t want
something that\'ll involve much effort on the part of anyone on the
design team - I want you all designing!  Just to be kept in touch
would be enough for me.  I do agree with what some other posters
have said though - if you want feedback on any ideas you are
thinking of, this group would be a good place to come.  You\'d get
excellent feedback from people with many years experience of
playing all the previous incarnations of Traveller, who would put
a lot of effort into responding to any queries.

Thanks for taking the time to get in touch - good luck with the
design work.

So if it is in the planetoids collum is is _not_ an asteroid belt;
therefore the planetoid belts number does not include asteroid belt
mainworlds.

    'body' => 'I LIKE the bell curve of MT; it seems to reflect my experiences as a
competetive marksman back in high school, when my learning curve was
higher. The same with computers now... the increase of result chances for a
given increase in skill gets much bigger for simple stuff, and much less
for harder stuff, with moderate stuff having the biggest gains, until a
certain point is hit, where the returns drop off.

[rant mode on]
My problem with the MT Task system is the LOW value of attributes in
relation to skill [5:1] and the relatively narrow non-crit-___  margin
[+2<->(-2)]; I would much prefer CS being 3 over and CF being 3 under, with
attributes being used at att/4 [4:1].

This also seems to be the critical break-point for attribute levels for
certain titles, like surgeon. (Many careers use it also, both basic and
advanced).


TNE, however, uses a 1:1 skill level/attribute level, and a given level of
skill or attribute is a simple (+20/+10/+5/+2.5/+1.25) at the five levels
of difficulty, and allows a character who meets the minimums of 1 level of
skill + 3 levels of attribute to have a 5% chance of success at the
Impossible task, something which only an expert (level 4+ minimum, with a
15 in the relavant attribute for a base +3 from attribute; total +7) could
do at all, and a maximum chance at it of 1/12 (less than 9%) assuming
hiting the DM limit of +8. Assuming Specialist Level 8, and a 10 in the
controlling attribute, that\'s a 4- on a d20, or 10%. FOr an Att14, skill 10
(the common max skill level allowed by all TNE GM\'s I\'ve talked TNE with in
alaska), that goes to a 6-, or 30% on an IMPOSSIBLE task; which the
coversions assure me will either be skill 5 -7 equivalent, and +3 (for a
15, because TNE atts are 1 point lower) from attribute, hitting the +8 DM
Limit, and maxing out at 8.something%!

Keep that in mind when trying to come up with a "universal descriptor
system"; after all, TNE uses the same difficulties (with one name change),
and most of the published tasks (except for combat tasks) had unchanged
difficulty levels in the conversion.

     Hi Don,
     
     Thanks for taking the time to send mail to the list.  Your name is 
     familiar - Hero system by any chance?
     
     As several people have already said, there is a great resource 
     available on this list.  Before Wizards of the Coast dumped their 
     RPG\'s they ran a list for Ars Magica, and the line developer (Wade 
     Racine) used to throw ideas for Ars Magica 4 to the list and see what 
     we made of them.  It was usually of the form "What do people think of 
     the current ageing rules? I\'m thinking of changing them to do this 
     because of this - any comments?".  I got the impression that Wade got 
     a lot of use from this approach; well he kept asking us for our 
     comments ;-).  After a discussion had gone on long enough Wade would 
     let us know that he had enough to make a decision on.  There was one 
     funny incident where someone asked "So, are we all agreed that 
     Teaching skill is out of ArM 4?" and Wade had to gently point out to 
     him that whilst he was inviting comment and opinions, he was not 
     handing out decision making powers to the list - *he* was in charge of 
     what went into the product.
     
     I found it very exciting to feel like I could be influencing a game I 
     love, or even just to see it taking shape in front of me.  I was even 
     considering having a friend in the states Fed Express me a copy as 
     soon as it came out (it can take about a month for new RPG\'s to get 
     over this side of the pond) - I was *that* excited.
     
      In direct response to your question of what we would like to know: 
     things like large scale changes - e.g. if you decide to change space 
     combat to be 3D with full vector movement requiring a physics degree, 
     special software and a cray to run it on, then I think I would find 
     that interesting (so I would know not to sell my copy of Battle Rider 
     ;-)).  Also, reasons for changes, new features, product ideas, release 
     dates.
     
     I think that\'s about it.  Good luck with the designing.  I\'m looking 
     forward to seeing T4 in the summer (or autumn over here).  It might 
     even inspire me to run some Traveller.
     
     Cheers,
     Liam

Your problem is that the ship needs 200 kiloliters of fuel/hour, but

Thanks for that... I thought that it would be that simple, but you 
never can tell ;-)  Now all I have to do is figure out design 
sequences and spreadsheets for all of the other craft types.

While I think about it... with regards to the (some might say) rapid 
advancements in technology, and in theoretical developments, over the 
past 20 years will T4 open up these fields?  From what I have seen of 
the older rules systems (i.e., MegaTraveller) they were based upon 
(proposed) advancements in the technology of the 1970\'s, yet quite a 
few areas of technology seem to have already been \'achieved.\'  For 
example, at the moment we have been able to construct "nano-robots," 
something which does not come into the old MT time-line until 
something like TL-17.  Some of the weirder forms of star-travel in 
the same Referee\'s Companion (moving planets through Jump-space and 
the like) might not seem like such too-far-off prospect depending 
upon which papers you read about information theory.  So, will MM be 
integrating new technologies into the Traveller universe, or doesn\'t 
anyone know at the moment?

Anyway, thanks for listening to me rant incoherently.

Actually this is almost the exact method used by Phoenix Command to resolve
automatic fire.  The main effort is to get the range right, then the fire
will create a beaten area in which you have tables that let you know what
the probability of hitting any give target in the area based upon number of
rounds fired and the size of the beaten area.  It works VERY well, and is
not nearly as complicated as it sounds.

>2. A machine gun is more lethal than anything. 155mm Artillery, flamethrowers, 
>mortars, rifle fire, anything. Millions of dead in hundreds of wars this
century
>can\'t be wrong. 

Sorry, I don\'t buy this.  Given that as an infantry waepon, the MG is
perhaps the best weapon around, there is a reason that Artillery is called
the "King of Battle"  More soldiers have been killed by artillery in every
major conflict from the invention of modern Artillery( WWI round abouts)
than any other single form of killing.  In fact I remember reading that in
WWI and II, more were killed by Artillery than by all other means combined.
The reason most people don\'t realize this is two fold.  1st.  Artillery is
employed exclusively in war.  MGs can be used in terrorist attacks, drive-by
shootings, etc.   No one ever sees what a 81mm mortar round can do, much
less a 155mm.  RPGs don\'t even address artillery usaully because survival of
artillery barrage is a matter of blind luck rather than any form of skill.
2ndly, Artillery can deliver much more than just explosives on a target.
Its primary ability is to stun the opponents infantry.  When a barrage is
raining down on a position, the ONLY thing that infantry can do in cower in
their holes and hope and pray (literally) that a round doesn;t drop nearby,
and that the hard top cover will hold against the air bursts and splinters.
ANYONE cought out in the open in a barrage is DEAD!!!.

RPGs like traveler don\'t bother with artillery also because it is usually
fairly slow in arriving, you have to call it in, then wait for ranging
shots, then repeat last the target into oblivion.  Once again I recommend
Pheonix Command\'s Artillery system for a good look at just how deadly
artillery can be.  It doesn\'t however work at all in a game.
 
>3. It is actually easier to hit a target that is some distance from you,
because
>you can walk fire onto it. 

Very True, this can best be simulated by having a inherrant accuracy for
each Automatic weapon that after recoil is subtracted from yeilds the
improvment in the to-hit roll.  Unfortunately most gaming systems don;t base
damage or hit location off of how well you hit (see Milleniums End or
Phoenix Command for this).  The Example would be as follows.

Person fires a LMG with a recoil of say 3 for a ROF of 10.  The continuing
accuracy of this weapon is say 5.  That would mean that your to-hit roll
will get 2 better each turn after the first of continuous fire.  If you stop
firing then you roll all over again.
Again a person fires a Assault Rifle with a recoil of 8 for a 10 round
burst.  The continuing accuracy of the rifle is also 5, now as you continue
to fire, the to-hit roll will become 3 WORSE each round.

Not necessarily dead, but likely HIT.  One problem with most RPGs is that we
equate a hit with a kill.  In actuality, a hit is often not a KILL, but
rather a disable.  A person who takes a shin bone shot will likely not die
with proper treatment, but will not be able to continue fighting.  In fact
for the most part when anyone is shot, they are usually out of the combat
due to the increadible shock of "I\'ve been hit"

18" of protection is the norm for small arms fire, however, since MG barrels
are longer, they generate more energy and thus go through a lot more.

I can\'t agree with you more.  The main reason the military issues body
armour is to protect from SHELL FRAGMENTS.  It MIGHT (big maybe) stop a
pistol round, but a 5.56N or a 7.62N, will tear through Kevlar with little
slowing.  Pistol rounds are usually larger and slower and can be slowed or
stopped by Kevlar.  Rifle rounds are not siginificantly slowed by it.

You might want to at least look at Phoenix Command for some ideas.  Ifnot I
would be glad to help out on this.  I would love to see a game ssytem that
creates a quick yet fairly realistic system for fire combat.  Phoenix
Command did this butthen no-one would play it for fear of dying to quick.
It goes to show why you ALWAYS take cover first in a fight then figure out
what to do.  IT also shows why firefights actually take a fair amount of
time to complete.

These are broad enough categories that anybody can understand, and then use
his/her own judgement to convert them. Or perhaps other guidelines. For example,
the MT "decoder" could say:

        Unskilled = no skill
        Beginner  = level 0
        Amateur   = level 1
        Competent = level 3
        Expert    = level 5 <<

Good idea! An expansion of the "Regular, Elite" etc in Striker, sort of thing.
We\'d have to steer clear of the normal task level words (Routine, etc).  Perhaps
in the standard code we could have a UTDP (universal task descriptor profile)
where letter 1 is for CT, 2 for MT, 3 for TNE and 4 for T4. So, a task described
as "8DRD, Mechanical" would be a roll on Mechanical, 8+ for Classic, Difficult
for MT, Routine in TNE and Difficult in T4.

You must have access to some rather surprising sources.  So far as I know,
we have nothing like full-fledged "nano-robots".  Scientists have managed
to manipulate single atoms using large-scale equipment like scanning 
electron microscopes (viz. the spelling-out of "IBM" dot-matrix-style a 
few years ago), and conceptual designs have been published for things
like nano-scale gears and rod-based computer systems.  But we are still
quite far from actually BUILDING the things, let alone building nano-scale
machines that will build other nano-scale machines, work together in an
organized and controlled fashion, etc.  We might well encounter new problems
in development which will push "true" nanotech (of the sort depicted in 
much recent popular SF) into the far future.

Nanotech would also have astounding repercussions on Imperial history and 
society: I suspect mere experimentation in the subject is heavily regulated,
though I wouldn\'t be surprised to see some very limited efforts (one-piece
hull building?) of great interest but also great expense.

Which papers would those be?  I tend to distrust some of the far-out 
theoretical work: too often it\'s amusing mathematic manipulations that
are wondrous in theory but a bit stiffer in practice.  Robert Forward
has presented all sorts of far-out physics, and Msr. Alcubierre has
"invented" his own warp drive, but many of them are easier to write
about than to actually conceive of building.

I suspect, actually, that he\'ll be quite conservative.  Look at the 
trouble GDW got into when they tried to change technologies with TNE,
and the great howl that went up from the assembled fans.  I would
wholeheartedly welcome "alternate technologies" like those presented
in FF&S (and I loved TNE\'s replacement of thruster plates with, well,
admittedly fantastic themselves, reaction drives).  But I suspect the
Traveller universe will remain a Galactic Empire (in some Milieus, at
least) steeped in Golden Age science fiction with occasional and not
overly intrusive admixtures of more recent themes and discoveries.

	As people describe the difficulty levels and ways of equalizing the 
MT and TNE systems, it begins to sound more and more like FUDGE to 
me.  FUDGE (Free Form Universal Donated Gaming Engine) for those of 
you who don\'t know about it, is sort of a net-GURPS.  It has nothing 
to do with GURPS per se, but it is a multi genre system.

	At its heart is a difficulty and expertise set that sound remarkably 
like what  Joe liked about saying he was an \'Expert Programmer\' 
rather than 8+. 

	It is hard to describe the mechanics of the system in just a few 
lines, but briefly, tasks and traits in FUDGE are :

Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great, Superb

A superb programmer needs only a poor result to achieve the same 
thing a mediocre programmer needs a great or superb result to 
achieve.

While I\'m not advocating that FUDGE be the system for Trav (though 
I\'ve considered converting ALL my game milieus: fantasy, cyberpunk 
Traveller, etc to FUDGE) this does make a convenient \'translator\' for 
determining difficulty levels in any given rules system.  Something 
could be described as a mediocre task, and then you could relatively 
easily figure out the necessary results in CT/MT/TNE/T4.

	I also think that Marc Miller, et al study FUDGE (and GURPS for that 
matter) as they design the rules systems. 

	the Home of fudge on the web is: 

http://oz.plymouth.edu/~gaming/fudfaq.html

	There has been a great deal of discussion over the years (in both 
rec.games.frp.* and rec.games design ) over the same issues people 
are struggling with here, such as what intervals to use between 
difficulty levels.  Much of that is discussed in the FUDGE faq at the 
site listed above, and in the FUDGE document itself, that could be 
very useful to people working this stuff out.

 Certainly.  I\'ve never suggested otherwise; it makes eminent
 sense, as you point out - and I\'ve even acknowledged this in the
 inclusion of the tech profile in the RICE Papers.

 But I question whether we were anywhere near tech _10_ last month-
 Massive Parallelism (TL8) isn\'t all that common, although
 Nonvolatile Memory (TL9) is; neither is Vocal Input (TL9) [and
 what is available isn\'t reliable].  Voice Transcription (TL10) is
 barely out of the SF stage - not as advanced as Holocrystal
 Storage (TL13) - and Advanced Synaptics (TL11) and
 Semi-Intelligent Robots (TL12) are still in the SF stage.  So
 what\'s our _real_ computer TL?  7 verging on 8 (Desktop Computers
 -> Massive Parallelism)? Early 9 (Nonvolatile Memory)?  Prototype
 13 (Holocrystal Storage)? All of the above?

 I think reality has gotten ahead of our Traveller writers...

	Hmmm.  It seems I have been mistaken about tech levels all this 
time!  I thought the level indicated that at which the device or whatever 
is invented/created/produced/whatever.  It appears from what you say 
above that, instead, the tech level refers to the time in which the item 
is common.
	Correct?


>  I think reality has gotten ahead of our Traveller writers...

	True.  That bothers me somewhat as well.  Hopefully, T4 will 
rectify that...for a few years, anyway. :)

        This wasn\'t exactly the best part of FF&S. For a 400 Td vessel you
need 4,000tonnes thrust. HEPlaR produces 20 tonnes per MW input. Therefore
you need 200MW, not 800. Now, each MW of power requires 0.25kl of LHyd and
you want 30G-hours (which is 60G-Turns in BL terms -- is that what you
wanted?). 200MW for 4Gs means 50MW for 1G. 50MW requires 12.5kl of fuel per
hour. So 30GHours requires 375kl. Much better.

        What\'s all this thrust-MW people are talking about??? There\'s no
such critter!

Your 400 Ton vessel requires 4000 _tonnes_ thrust. No thrust-MW! Using
HEPlaR, you generate 20 _tonnes of thrust_ per _MW of input power_. Ergo,
4000 tonnes thrust require 200MW of power.

Produced in large numbers by the Solomani Confederation in the decades
preceeding the Final War, the \'Jayasuriya\' Class Gunship was designed for
merchant escort and anti-piracy operations, as well as picket and patrol
duty.  The \'Jayasuriya\' was designed by Waikapu Interstel (Aldebaran) and
entered service in 1072.  Unsuited for line operations, the gunship saw
service mainly in the less heavily populated rimward areas of the
Confederation before the Second Rim War.  From 1117, the type saw extensive
service against the Imperium, although it never supplanted the slightly
smaller and considerably less expensive \'Victrix\' Class Multimission Sloop
in numbers.

I hate to rain on you parade:-)  But 18 inchs of what... Sand, a 5.56Nato fired from a M16A2 at 400 meters is

Body Armour made from metal with ceramic plate inserts will stop a 7.62mm round.  Also Flak Jackets(Body 
Armour) got its name from the WW2 Bomber Crews that war it to protect them against Flak.

If the T4(NT, TAT) task system is not too different from the others(and it doesn\'t
seem that this would be the case) The difficulty levels would just be the same
if the skill conversion is right. As I\'ve shown in my former post a conversion
centered at the "difficult" difficulty level works fairly well(it is not exact,
but I also stated that this is simply not possible without large conversion
tables and n\'th degree mathematics) There is a minor problem with classic 
traveller, but simly giving the MT task difficulty table would be enough to
give every CT traveller referee the numbers he wants.

primarily as a deterrent weapon when loaded with NUC/CHEM/BIOL warheads.
The missile is typically accurate to within 100m, making it more of a terror

Well, doug, \'t all depends... it would get you a feel for how things
were... and be closer to how they\'re gonna be than TNE... Do you want the
brief history of the shatter? Do you want a good all around game that is
full of typos?

I\'d say a qualified go for it: as long as you\'re gonna use it between now
and august, or going to run classic or shatter (1050-1135) in the fall, go
for... But if you\'re gonna get it for "compatability, not enough has leaked
here to tell yet... IMHO.

    'body' => 'The following article has not to be taken to serious, but its about
something I once (and now again) thought about when I read this 
discussions about task systems. 

THE CUSTOMIZABLE TASK SYSTEM

----
1.0.0) SKILLS
----

1.1.0) MAXIMUM SKILL: First decide about the maximum skill value of 
       a human in the system. This level is called Smax. This level 
       may be adjusted later. 

1.2.0) MINIMUM SKILL: The minimum skill value will be defined later. 
       It is called Smin

1.3.0) AVERAGE SKILL: The skill of an average human with average 
       training is called Savr. This value is determined later.

----
2.0.0) EFFECT OF SKILL
----

2.1.0) SKILL EFFECT: The skill may either produce a different target
       number, or will result in the rolling of several dice.

2.2.0) TARGET NUMBER: Proceed to step 3.0.0) if the skill will modify the
       target number and You want to roll target number or less. 
       Ignore step 8.0.0)
2.2.1) REVERTED TARGET NUMBER: If You like rolling high instead of low,
       You will have to make some minor adjustments in the evaluation
       step. Otherwise treat this system as a normal target number system.

2.3.0) NUMBER OF DICE: Number of dice systems should use a linear "curve"
       for every die roll, but this is not required by this system. 
       However, select Smax not to define the maximum skill but the number
       of steps You want for every die roll. Smin will become the minimum
       result You want for every die roll. Savr will be the average result
       for every die roll. Then proceed with steps 3.0.0) to 6.0.0) to 
       determine Gran, Adjs and N(these terms are explained later) for 
       every die roll. Then use step 8.0.0) to evaluate Your Task
       system. 
2.3.1) NUMBER AND KIND OF DICE: A special case of a number of dice system
       is to use different Gran, Adjs and N for every skill level. If You 
       want a system like this You\'ve to use steps 3.0.0) to 5.0.0) for every
       skill level possible. Then use step 8.0.0) to evaluate Your Task
       system.
               

----
3.0.0) DICE USED
----

3.1.0) POPABILITY CURVE: Decide if You want a linear "curve" or a
       bell curve to determine the success of skill rolls. For a
       linear curve the Granularity(later called Gran) is 1. For a
       bell curve Gran should be equal or greater than 2. The higher
       the Gran, the better the bell curve.

3.2.0) GRANULARITY: Select the desired Gran. Remember it must be 1 for
       linear systems.
3.2.1) Devide Smax by Gran, round fractions to nearest whole number
       and look at the following table what kinds of dice You have to roll:
       Smax/Gran  Dice
           0      NA. Use either worse Gran or higher Savr
           1      NA. See above.      
           2      d2. Use 6 sided die. 1-3 = 1, 4-6 = 2
           3      d3. Use 6 sided die. 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2, 5-6 = 3
           4      d4. Use 4 sided die.
           5-6    d6. Use 6 sided die.
           7-8    d8. Use 8 sided die.
           9-10   d10. Use 10 sided die.
          11-13   d12. Use 12 sided die.
          14-16   d15. Use 30 sided die. Halve result. RFU.
          17-25   d20. Use 20 sided die.
          26-40   d30. Use 30 sided die.
          40-75   d50. Use d100. Halve result. RFU.
          76-125  d100. Use d100 or 2d10.
         126-250  d200. Use d6 and 2d10. d6 is first digit. 
                  1-3 = 0, 4-6 = 1.
         251-750  d600. Use d6-1 as first digit. 2d10 as other digits.
         601-1000 d1000. Use 3 d10.
           1001+  Make up yourself.  
3.2.2) Smin is equal to Gran.
3.2.3) Savr is equal to (Smin + Gran * N) / 2, where N is the number of
       faces of the dice determined in 2.2.1)
3.2.4) Smax is adjusted to (Gran * N), where N is the same as in 2.2.3)
3.2.5) Remember the N determined at 2.2.3)

----
4.0.0) ADJUSTING MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM SKILL
----

4.1.0) SELECT DESIRED MINIMUM SKILL: If You don\'t like Smin, but think
       Smax is not as importend, select the new desired minimum skill, 
       called Nmin.
4.1.1) Determine the adjustment Adjs by substracting Nmin from Smin, 
       retaining positive or negative sign.

4.2.0) SELECT DESIRED MAXIMUM SKILL: If You don\'t like Smax, but think
       Smin is not as importend,  select the new desired maximum skill, 
       called Nmax.
4.2.1) Determine the adjustment Adjs by substracting Nmax from Smax, 
       retaining positive or negative sign.
 
4.3.0) ADJUST SKILL RANGE: Adjust Smin, Smax and Savr.
4.3.1) Smin is now equal to Smin-Adjs.
4.3.2) Savr is now equal to Savr-Adjs.
4.3.3) Smax is now equal to Smax-Adjs.

Examples: 
   The GURPS system is a target number system with Gran 3, N6, Adjs 0.
   The FUDGE system is a number of dice system with Gran 1, N3, Adjs 2.
   The MT system is a reverted target number system with Gran 2, N6, 
   Adjs -1(The minimum skill in MT is actually 3, because You have to
   roll 11+, equal to 3- to be successful at an difficult task with
   skill 0. Skill 0 is therefor equal to skill 3 in this system until this
   point. Of course later in the system it is possible to adjust this 
   oddity)
   The TNE system is a target number system with Gran 1, N20, Adjs 0.
   The Star Wars System is a number of dice system with Gran 1, N6, Adjs 0.

6.1.0) NUMBER OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS: Select the number of difficulty 
       levels You want. This is Dnum. For this system, the central level 
       (called Difficult) is numbered 0. This
       is the level, where an average man with average skill (Savr) has 
       about 50% chance of success. Dnum may be defined as unlimited.
6.1.1) EASY DIFFICULTIES: Levels where the difficulty for success is
       increased. The number of easy difficulty levels(Deas) is (Dnum+1)/2. 
       Decide if You want ro round fractions up or down. But You have
       to round the other way in the next step. Of course if Dnum is
       unlimited, Deas is unlimited too.
6.1.2) FORMIDABLE DIFFICULTIES: Levels where the difficulty for 
       success is inceased. The number of formidable difficulty levels
       (Dfor) is (Dnum+1)/2. Remember to round in the opposite direction as
       in 6.1.1) That is Deas is not equal to Dfor if Dnum is an even number.
       And Deas+1+Dfor = Dnum must be true. Of course if Dnum is
       unlimited, Dfor is unlimited too.  
6.1.1) EFFECT OF DIFFICULTY LEVELS: You have to decide if the 
       difficulties have an SIMPLE, LINEAR or BELL effect on the 
       difficulty of the Task. A SIMPLE effect would produce the 
       easiest procedure, but may result in a very wierd Task System,
       while the LINEAR and BELL approach will produce exactly what 
       You want.

Examples:
    GURPS is a simple system with unlimited Dnum.
    The FUDGE system is a simple system with Dnum = 7, Deas = Dfor = 3
    The MT system is a simple system with Dnum = 4, Deas =2, Dfor =1.
    The TNE system is a linear system with Dnum = 5, Deas = Dfor = 2.
    The Star Wars system is a simple system with Dnum unknown to me
    at the moment.

I think the problem here is that FF&S and the Ship Design Worksheet included
with the Player Forms Supplement work this out in two different ways.  A
Thrust-Megawatt(ThMW) is a Megawatt from the power source devoted to thrust.
According to the Ship Design Worksheet, a ship must have ThMW equal to:

                0.5 * Hull Disp (Td) * Maneuver G\'s

This is, of course, stated no where in FF&S.  FF&S is rather vague on the
subject unless you assume a set average number of tonnes(weight) per
ton(displacement/volume), which is what David did above.  I think I came up
with the (or as close to the) method used by the design staff by comparing
FF&S with BL and the Ship Design Worksheet.  I remember BL being the key
that made the peices fit together dispite the misprint of 0.1 * Hull Disp *
ManG.

Anyway, your 400 ton 4G ship will require 800 ThMW and will consume 50
liters of fuel per G per hour(this is how the listing in the book examples
shou be read).  Also, as was mentioned before:

>Your problem is that the ship needs 200 kiloliters of fuel/hour, but

>G-hours of acceleration, not one.  So, to get 30 G-hours of

Anyway, I just thought I would add my input to the discussion.

I don\'t know if I\'m crazy, but it seems that lots of meople get confused
with the similarity between tons and tonnes.  One tonne is a measure of
weight equal to 1000 kilograms (also called a metric ton (more confusion)
and about 2200 pounds)  one ton (not metric ton, just ton) is a measure of
displacement or volume and can vary in weight or tonnes.  Just immagine
trying to rig you ship for maneuver for a load of feathers and then trying
to carry a load of lead. (I know its an over-used example, but it is a good
one.)

Hope this info helps whoever asked the initial question as well as anyone
else that was wondering.

Hi,

I don\'t remeber if this is stated in the rules or if it\'s one of my 
house rules, but...
I always place the mainworld in the hospitable zone if it\'s 
available (after placing asteroidbelts and gas giants, if a gas giant 
is in the hospitable zone i place the mainworld as a satelite to it). 
This has the effect that all other planets get a -4 or -5 
pop DM, and the chance of a secondary planet getting a higher 
population than the mainworld is small.

        This is the way I was taught to use a MG. During assault range
        training (Broken country with approaching pop-up targets that fall
        down when hit. Dug-in positions with remote-controlled explosive
        charges to simulate enemy fire.  Targets approach from cover to
        cover, and when hit, the target is re-set to its starting postilion.
        Beats any computer game.) I usually used a 7.62x39 belt-fed LMG with
        1-4 tracer ratio. After I got the hang of it, it was relatively easy
        to knock down the targets by steering the tracer line.

>4. If you are within the beaten zone of a machine gun, you are dead.

        Usually yes. A dug-in MG or a pillbox is usually a major problem,
        especially if you don\'t have an underbarrel GL or shoulder-fired
        AT launcher.

> ... however, since MG barrels are longer, they generate more energy and
> thus go through a lot more.

        Longer barrel does not always mean that the bullet would have more
        energy. Beyond the critical point the bullet-barrel friction will
        be grater than the accelerating pressure, and the bullet will slow
        down. For example, most .22 LR rounds will have the highest muzzle
        velocity when fired through 37 cm barrel.

        Basically, the kinetic energy of bullet depends on the energy stored
        in the powder, and the efficiency of the barrel. Too short and too
        long barrels will have poor efficiency.

        There are many kinds of body armor, but generally it is better
        to find a cozy hole than catch a bullet. At least three different
        types of body armor are used in the Finnish Defense Forces:

        Fragment Vest is a light armor that is designed to stop fragments
        and ricochets. It might stop a pistol bullet from a long range

        Bullet Vest is designed to stop all pistol bullets and might stop
        a rifle bullet from a long range.

        Assault Vest is designed to stop all small-arms bullets, but 14.5 mm
        HMG will knock holes through it.

        ----

        I think that TNE autofire rules can only be used to simulate
        suppression fire, where multiple burst or continuous full-auto
        is fired at the general direction of enemy. This basically means
        hosing down the enemy positions, and forcing them to stay down.

        Point fire means firing aimed bursts at single target. This is
        much more accurate and lethal than suppression fire. For point
        fire I used the autofire rules taken from "Call of Cthulhu".

        In TNE terms the rules are:

        For each additional shot fired at target during a burst, the hit
        change is increased by +1. However, no matter how many shots are
        fired, these bonuses can only double the original skill.

        If a hit is scored, a dice roll shows how many bullets actually
        hits the target.

        Example: 3-round burst gives (3-1 = ) +2 to hit, and may cause
        1d3 hits. 10-round burst gives (10-1 = ) +9 to hit and may cause
        1d10 hits.

considered to hold (it seems about TL-8 for most of the fields, as 
represented in MT Referee\'s Companion, as I think I have said before) 
the question is how technology would affect the perception of the new 
incarnation of Traveller.  Traveller has always in the past, as far 
as I can tell, had a reputation of being a *science*-fiction game.  
Its various off-shoots, for example 2300 AD, have been considered 
"hard(ish?)" science-fiction.  TNE went along way to bringing this 
point across with the FF&S product (though it would have been nice if 
they had actually given design sequences for items other than guns, 
guns, guns, armour and vehicles... but that\'s just a personal 
preference).  However, if T4 cannot keep up with changing 
technologies, in my opinion, it will begin to be seen as a 
space-opera game.  That is how most of the people I have talked to 
about Traveller are beginning to see it at present, let alone in the 
future.  The technology just isn\'t "cutting edge" enough to make 
people say "yeah, cool."  One roleplaying research scientist friend 
of mine said that he thought Traveller was, essentially, the 
present-day with spaceships.  Okay, some of the stuff could be 
considered "high-tech" (artificial gravity, inertial dampeners, 
bonded super-dense armour, etc., etc.) but the statement is 
essentially true.  Even optimistic me could not really 
justify putting the majority of *Regency* level technology more than 
100 years in the future (let alone 3000-odd years!).  

So, if this perception of Traveller changes from sci-fi to space 
opera will this have an adverse affect upon the sales of the new 
incarnation?  People might say, "To hell with buying Traveller 4!  I 
could just buy Star Wars and play in a system which doesn\'t have the 
complexity *and* I can put whatever darned technology in I like."  
Would this mean that Traveller 4 would still have the die-hard 
followers of Traveller and that would be it.  

Okay, so my knowledge of the game-industry isn\'t that detailed, but 
this is just how the majority of people that I know think things are 
going to go.  It would seem relatively logical to assume that if T4 
is going to sell, and sell well (as I hope it well), then it will 
have to hit people with something that they haven\'t seen before, and 
not just increasing efficiency and range.  

Ode to being flamed... ;-)

for rules procedures, and writing the rules in the type of simple 
instructional language used in many good wargames.  Examples and prose 
should not be included in the main body of a subsystem of rules so as not to 
break up the flow of instructions.  I would suggest examples be placed in 
the margins or written after the rules section in question.  Please consider 
focusing on utility and clarity.  I may be barking up the wrong tree, so I 
ask that you forward this to whomever it concerns if you are not involved 
with this aspect of the design.

I am especially concerned with rules for the various types of combat and 
design sequences.  Learning these systems in the various Traveller editions 
has gotten progressively more difficult and confusing, because the rules 
were not well organized and clear.  One had to jump around often, interpret 
ambiguous flowery prose, and memorize what paragraphs the exceptions to the 
rules were buried in and so on.  It gets worse when one is actually 
refereeing combat in a game and the players must wait impatiently (bad for 
introducing new players!) while the referee tries to figure out how to 
resolve shotgun fire, for example.  The rules should be highly organized to 
the point where it should be obvious what the next step is, and references 
to other rules should have paragraph numbers (or symbols or whatever).  I\'ve 
been refereeing Traveller in all its incarnations since 1982, and I often 
get slowed down by the convoluted manner in which the rules are 
disorganized.

If for no other reason, your company\'s emphasis on getting new players for 
Traveller should be reason enough to organize the rules in such a manner 
that they can be learned and applied quickly and easily.

Thank you, and good luck!

    'body' => 'The Army policy is 18" of something defines "hard cover".  18" of wood,
earth, etc.  This is not necessarily always true, however it is a good "rule
of thumb" to use when discussing cover with people who think a car door will
stop a rifle round (cause it did in Terminator).  The main reason for using
18" is to emphasise that a Sheet Rock wall will not stop a bullet, nor will
a car.  You need a boulder, a really big tree, or a hill.  It is kind of
hard to find steel plate on the battlefield, except for that knocked out
Bradley B-).

As for Body Armour with metal plates and ceramic inserts stopping a 7.62, at
what range, and how much does it weigh.  The Flack Jacket issued by the U.S.
Army is made of Kevlar because it is lighter than the old style flack
jackets and is supposed to stop shrapnel better.  The major problem with
perceptions of personal armour is that a normal person can carry enough
protection to stop a normal small arm round.

When using Traveller rules, the difference in TL is good because a modern TL
8 Kevlar Vest can pretty much stop a .50 cal Musket ball TL-3, although you
will still probably get a few broken ribs and get knocked down. 

Speaking of Knock Down, there aren\'t many systems that do knock down well,
and blunt trauma also.  I did like TNE\'s handling of it however (well at
least the blunt trauma (even if it was a little low)).

I guess my problem with body armour is this... It is too heavy to wear for
extended periods in amounts that will actually protect you from damage.  You
can accept a Kevlar Vest that will slow down a bullet so that it might not
kill you, but it will still most likely knock you out of the combat for a
fair amount of time.  Now with the invention of Power Assist body armour,
you can get a lot more armour on a person to make them nigh invulnerable
from small arms fire, however, that person can then carry so much more
weight in the form of offensive firepower that the net result is about the
same, to whit a comparably equiped soldier can make you just as dead with
one shot.  To this end I believe the cost effectiveness issue will preclude
equiping lots of troopers with Power Armour.  The vast majority will wear
little if any armour and carry a missle or such for taking out the
occaisional Power Trooper.  The only real use Power Armour gets is for
things like Orbital Assaults, or when going up against vastly inferior
forces.  Even so a Power Trooper is just like a small tank, and in some
cases more expensive.  They can be very powerful if the opposition has no
way of hurting them, but are managable in the larger scale.

Sorry to ramble again, but Battle Dress just doesn\'t make alot of sense to
me, the Walkers from 2300ad (or the Schalli Walkers from POT) made more
sense sort of a small mobile Armored Fighting Vehicle that carries squad
support weapons and is largely impervious to small arms fire.  Whole
battalions of Battle Dress strike me as expensive and not nearly as
efficient (except for orbital invasions).

P.S. has anyone ever really thought out the amount of materiel needed to
invade another planet?  Think of the logistics of moving a force from a
planet 1 jump away, then supporting them from an orbital area through a
resisted landing.  Then comes the resupply issues keeping them supplied with
ammo, feed, replacements for equipment and personel.  It is a massive
undertaking that we tend to gloss over.  I beleive the backbone of the
military would be the fast merchant ship that can land on a planets surface
open up nose and tail and load/offload quickly.  Figure out sometime how
much m^3 is takes to move a Grav Battalion from one planet to another.
Don\'t forget to figure in the Mechanics and the spare parts.  It brings up
an interesting point that interstellar invasion just might be impossible on
a large scale.

You guys need to check out OCS\' game Battlelords of the 23rd Century.  In
their Galctic Handbook II, they introduce a race of genenginered rabbits
that are about 6\' tall plus ears.  They are bipedal, and are designed to act
like rednecks from the Deep South (U.S.).  They refrain from using high tech
weapons like blasters and Pulse Cannons and use instead muskets that they
call Foo-Foo Guns.  They also keep on about how the South WILL Rise Again
(although none know what the SOuth actually is.  Lastly they have a 1%
chance per month to fall into a cataleptic state where they will hop around
and hide eggs.

The best part is that they are used as an actuall race.

Battlelords, the cross between Paranoia, Traveller, and Call of Cthulu.  It
is a hoot, but since you character will likely not make it past the first
encounter, then it kindof has to be.

I\'ve always thought that Powered Armor doctrine would be limited to certain 
settings;

1). As a support member of a squad in planetary armies.

2). As support squads in planetary armies (one per platoon maybe).

3). As regular troopers in Marine Assault units (drop troops especially).

It is interesting that the very factor you mention, the cost and difficulty 
of supporting an operation from outside a given system, would to me lead to 
support the greater use of armored troops for orbital invasion.

If need to invade a planet, but want to cut costs and the number of hulls 
required to do so, you want to "multiply" your forces.  This means;

1). More armored vehicles

2). Infantry in armor

3). More support like airborne CAS (battlefield Meson gunboats?) artillery 
and ortillery (orbital artillery for those who haven\'t seen the term).

Think of it this way.  The (arbitrary) combat value of an unarmored soldier 
is one.  That soldier in BD is valued at 4.  The addition of armor to the 
transported materials is equal to half again what the soldier alone requires. 
Therefore we can get 4 times the combat value for 1.5 times the transport 
space required.

Dollars spent being equal, there is a trade off of numbers for capability.  
Shipborne troops, with the emphasis on limited space, have the need to be as 
effective as possible with as little space taken up as possible for their 
value in combat.  Planetary troops do not have the same priorities and can 
substitute two, three or four soldiers for the increased value of the single 
BD trooper.  Planetaries are at the numbers end of the tradeoff, Shipbornes 
are at the capability end.

As for whether it is possible to conduct major troop movements across 
planetary distances, last time I looked (using MT) that question did not bear 
very close scrutiny.  I tried to design a battalion sized assault transport 
at 5000 tons and ended up with a platoon transport.  (I think I made the 
mistake of trying to include the support units as well).  Also, I think 
several fleet carriers for each invasion would be the norm, since hundreds or 
thousands of shipboard fighters would be needed to provide the initial 
support for landing operations on a well-inhabited planet of any considerable 
tech level.  This all assumes that somehow "deep meson" sites of MT and CT 
canon (it has one \'n\' in this usage) have been removed (violently) or made 
inoperative in other ways (destruction of sensors, jamming, espionage).

This also brings us nicely back to the idea of "Megafreighters" which designs 
have been seen here.  I am certain that it takes 10,000 to 1 million ton 
freighters to provide a division with the supplies it needs on a daily basis 
(not to mention transporting the division itself) to conduct an invasion (or 
mopping up).  I would, as a commander, assume that there will be no usable 
supplies on-planet (If the native population is hostile), and in any case I 
hope I\'m attacking a lower-tech world which would not be able to supply 
certain items (ammo, missile reloads, etc. etc.).  

One nightmarish possibility is that the planet cannot even supply *water*.  
Can you imagine if the Allies in WWII had needed to bring all their own water 
with them across the beaches?  (I see serious scenario possibilities here).

I\'m not sure if I\'m remembering correctly (I don\'t have my MT stuff here at
work to check on it), but doesn\'t MT require that each year a character has
to spend a certain amount of money, an ammount multiplied by SS IIRC.  This
money is supposed to cover the clothes and food and stuff the character
buys.  I think I remember something about this being necessary to maintain
the characters SS at it\'s current level.  I don\'t know how this would apply
to characters who spend a year/years stranded on an uninhabited planet.

This doesn\'t leave for much role playing and doesn\'t force characters to
mind their money as much as might be necessary in real life, but who really
wants to role play paying the bills. :)

We do NOT have the ability to construct "nano-robots" now nor will we in
the near future. If you\'re interested in nanomachines you should pick up
"Nanosystems" by K Eric Drexler ISBN 0-471-57547-X. It\'s very technical but
describes how they could work and also how nanocomputers might be
constructed. For good rules on designing robots, nano or not, pick up GURPS
Robots which has the best robot designsystem I\'ve seen, far surpassing the
ones in JTAS, Robots and Vampire Fleets.

	But remember Murphy\'s Law of Combat #16: Tracers trace both ways.

	I have caught unwary players more than once with that one (in Trav

[snip]

It is worth keeping in mind that, 60 years ago, the idea of the "all tank
army" in which large formations of men, infantry as well as specialist
tanks, traveled into battle in armored fighting vehicles was considered
ridiculous.  Today, its considered the norm  for first line forces in high
intensity conflict.  The question of efficiency in a military context is a
difficult one for two reasons:
(1) the actual value of a trained soldier is often underestimated.  The you
are really quite expensive, you never have enough of them when you need
them,  and if you run out of them while fighting a battle you are in serious
trouble.
(2) the emotional value of an individual soldier is higher still.  If you
are Joe Stalin making policy for the Soviet Union in WWII, then the value of
the individual soldier is 0, and you set them on top of the tanks -- the
tanks are worth real money;  If you are in the high command for a regime
that cannot afford to ignore its people and is likely to fight a war, than
yes mam, little Johnie\'s going to have the most effective equipment money
can buy, yessiree.

That does not mean that I think that every imperial trooper will be in
battledress, any more than every soldier today deploys on tracks behind
armour plate.  (For one thing, the  imperium seems to be pretty good at
ignoring its people).  But I would not be surprised to see them by the
battalion, if not by the division.

I seem to remember a rule from MT(?) that stated that a PC had to spend an
amount equal to his/her SOC x Cr250 each month to keep up apperances.  Not
spending enough would lower the apparent SOC to the appropriate level.

I enjoyed this rule, as it freed me from gaming out every instance where a
PC had to part with a single Credit!

An experiment for those interested.  Build a squad of TL14 Troopers.  Give
them whatever weapons you feel necessary.  Now, total up the cost.  Use the
same amount to equip troops with Combat Enviroment Suits, Gauss Rifles, and
(most importantly) HEAP RAM Grenades.  Let the Troopers go first, odds are a
lot of smoking bodies.  Unfortunatly, there are a lot of unpowered folks
left, and they all let fly with the HEAP rounds.

Powered Armor troops have a limited use.  In the Imperium, Marines and Jump
Troops serve to open planet-heads, seize starports, and neutralize, or at
least confuse, defending commands.

Well, Battle Dress is far more portable.  Also, it seems to me that it
meshes better with troops.  Instead of 3 meters of robotic terror, you have
a bulky suit fighting along side you.

<Grin> Have I thought about it?  Most of my Traveller career!

My brother and I had an interesting debate on the topic, centered around
where you want the fleet to come in, at the mainworld or a Gas Giant.  I
held out for GG since it gives you a marshalling point.  Using microjumps to
arrive at the system\'s main planet gives you a slight edge, since the enemy
can\'t predict *exactly* when you\'ll re-appear.

There are three basic invasion types.  Unopposed, when you show up and land
occupation troops unmolested.  Light Resistance, where the world is prepared
to fight, but the outcome is never really in doubt, and Opposed, where the
enemy has the means and the will to turn this thing into a bloodbath.  It is
this final type that concerns us.

The first targets will be communications.  If you can knock them off the
air, you have reduced their effiency ten-fold.  This will most likely be
done from orbit.  The next phase, where the invasion really begins, is
seizing a "beachhead", preferably the starport.  This is accomplished using
Jump Troops.  Equipped with Battle Dress and the gear that can stuffed in a
capsule with them, they are sent to seize transportation points, surviving
commo facilities, government buildings, etc.  But the first priorty has to
be to secure a landing area for the first wave.

The first wave down will most likely be dismounted lift infantry.  their
mission will be to relieve the Jump Troops, who by this time will be low on
everything, and to secure the port.  They will probably bring specialist
units (port control, EPW guards, enginners) with them.

Next down will be Grav Tanks.  Once again the primary mission is too secure
the landing point against the inevitable counter-attack.

Assuming the enemy doesn\'t wipe the force off the planet, the real
off-loading can begin.

I won\'t go into all the gritty details, but reading about Operation Overlord
can tell you the massive nightmare that a large invasion produces for the
logistics staff.

the stuff could be considered "high-tech" (artificial gravity, inertial

essentially true.  Even optimistic me could not really justify putting the 
majority of *Regency* level technology more than 100 years in the future 
(let alone 3000-odd years!).

Some of you may put me in the same category as the bunnies, but I agree with 
this statement 200%.  I would like to reiterate my plea that one of the 
first scenarios produced for the new Traveller is one that goes past the 
future of TNE (c. 1300?) to give us technology that feels like high tech (TL 
17-18!! Great!), as Mark explained.  Of course, I would also like to see the 
future of the TNE background, but I also think Traveller would do well to 
have interesting new high tech published for it.  The science can only be 
explained well, it doesn\'t have to be possible with today\'s knowledge (like 
most current Traveller tech). I hope the IG people read this, and realize 
that this would be another way to attract new players!  Certainly going back 
to the Interstellar Wars or Year 0 is not going to give us high tech; 
instead it will be a step backward.

GRAV YACHT DOWN: A TRAVELLER ADVENTURE   by Tariq Rashid


You sit in the lobby of the vertiport of the City of Aubaine, located in the
wilderness regions on the planet Aurigae.  The 2nd planet in the Mentor
system.  Bright white sunlight shines through the giant overhanging sunroof
throwing the shadows of the sargos trees growing indoors onto the floor  and
occupants of the lobby. Over the PA system you hear a female voice announce.....

"New Aubayn Lines grav yacht to Kyranda will begin boarding in 30 minutes"

You are about to board the wilderness Explorer, a Grav Yacht which is the
only way out of Aubayn for one week. 

The Grav Yacht, Wilderness Explorer (WE) is scheduled to depart at 0800 Std
On 003/1220 from the small vertiport at Aubayn.  It will travel a low
altitude low speed scenic route (About 100 meters, 100 kph) about 3600 km to
the Starport at Kyranda.  A Starship is outbound from there at 1200 Std
005/1220.  The next ship will arrive two weeks later.

The Pcs for the mosr part will be gathered in the lobby and can take some
time to get to know one another. There will be NPCs in the group to agitate
things if no Pcs do it.
One NPC, an agent of the Nemon National League, will arrive just in time
with Union of Senled operatives pursuing about one hour behind.

The departure of the Wilderness Explorer will be delayed 30+(1d6*5) minutes
which should be a cause for greatagitation for this NPC.  The Yacht can be
boarded by reservation only which the Union of Senled agents do not have.
They have no legal authority and so cannot force their way on board.

THE TRAVELLERS
The group of travellers will consist of

AhrAhdNhiCour. A Sraph Pilgrim coming to learn about another joint
consciousness creature rumored to live in the wilds of this planet.  The
pilgrim was not able to locate this creature and is returning home
dissappointed.  Sraph are a group consciousness creature that are normally
bonded together in groups of 4-6, 2 are barely sentient,and one..well.  Ala
"A Fire Upon the Deep"

A wealthy tourist couple on Vacation with lots of souveniers including one
very strange looking ovoid object purchased from a "collecter"

Takaro "Taki" Kurosawa.  The Nemon Agent with info about secret Union of
Senled bases/experiments.

Ophelra Bresheliah, A young guntotin\' hunter with a big gun and several
dragon skulls.(the prince of Arturon)

Ambrus Csazar, Neosol Federation Gamma soldier survivalist returning from
leave where he camped out in the wilderness for two weeks.

Dr Anna Quintanna.  A Xenoarchaeologist and her field tech Neeva returning
from a research expedtion.

Arcturus the Ellowyn, friend of the tine creature, extremely powerful
psionic but 
physically very frail. Wispy flowing limbs. 

Strephon Pecorin, Young business man with cellcom,minicomputer, PDA etc.
Trying to make money off of Aubayn\'s new rapid growth.

Robert or BOB, this is a Personal Digital Assistant or rather a android that
acts as Strephon Pecorin\'s aide.  He is a TL 12 grav supported droid with a
full commo suite.
The same things that affect the yacht have a peculiar effect on BOB.

Mr Foote, the Union of Senled Agent masquerading as a collector of
artifacts. He wants to find out what Taki Kurosawa knows and if possible
kill him without being caught.

The crew of the WE including the Pilot(PC), Copilot,Engineers(1), and
Stewards(2)



DEPARTURE
One of the Union agents gets aboard because someone else doesnt show (He
will pretend to be a collector)
Aside from the delay, the trip begins normally taking off across the
beautiful lake Batiayn which stretches for 100km away from the vertiport.
The mist shrouded hills pass below and as the day continues everything seems
normal.  Once over the Forest of Innor the canopy is opened so that the
passengers can enjoy the open air and Mentorshine.
In a large clearing an Arranda\'s Dragon(See Creatures) will be seen running
down some victim, the hunter will whip out his gun and take a very difficult
shot at him.  This will naturally be a source of contention amongst the
travellers.

The route will carry the WE over ruins of ancient temples, towering trees
(300+ft), steaming geothermal fed lakes of reds and greens.  Valleys full of
sun flowers.  A weaker variety of Larry Niven\'s own.  The Yacht will put up
the shades.

After awhile Upper atmospheric EM communications will get rough due to
stronger the normal solar activity(by the Pilot\'s explanation) and continue
to degrade until blanking out altogether.  This does not effect line of
sight transmissions.

Some flying creatures will join up with the WE from time to time, some are
dangerous and some are curious and will land if encouraged.

SHIPBOARD DRAMA
The conflict between the Nemon agent "Taki" and the Union Agent Mr Foote.
A high stakes card game with the tourists and the businessman/woman

The Engineer passes out on deck. He was just sick but It\'ll make the events
to follow more confusing.

The Prince of Arturon shooting at things with his off world ElectroOptical,
laser sighted 10 KCr rifle.  Three times the Per cap GDP of his country

Arcturus and AhrAhdNhiCour, Arcturus growing very agitated sensitivity to
Gravitic Inf.

BOB flipping out, small things at first, then it gets dangerous.
He is programmed to aide and reduce stress for his owner, Strephon.  The
Gravitic and EM interference somehow causes BOB to lose his robotic mind.
He begins to take every criticism from Strephon as a deadly insult and will
try to keep individuals who he believes cause Strephon stress away from
Strephon, he will go so far as to use his Electric Stunner or worse.  He
will make a habit of following any PCs which he deems stressors to Strephon.

The businessman trying to close a megaCr deal

GRAV YACHT DOWN
Eventually the Yacht will suffer a total and catastrophic failure of both
the main and secondary gravitic field generators.  The Emergency Procedure
for Grav gen failure is Switch to secondary generator, Engage emergency
thrusters.
The pilot PC will have the option of putting it down in the trees or the
river.  Both will be difficult but the trees would probably be catastrophic.
The yacht may bottom out in the river depending on the piloting roll
possibly damaging the hull allowing water to enter.  Maybe damaging the Aux
propulsion system.  Any Pcs that did not brace may be injured or thrown
overboard.  If in a crash seat, no chance of this.

PLAN OF ACTION
First stabilize the yacht
Stop water from entering
Rescue anyone thrown overboard.
Shut down reactor due to ruptured heat exchanger.

The first option will be to load everyone in the air raft and get out of there.
The Air Raft will have sustained some minor yet repairable damage.

It will take a moment to get the computer maps up and operating but ordinary
charts are available These however lack detail and in particular do not show
a series of rapids on the river which culminates in a significant waterfall.
As these are rough aerial survey charts.

There is a checkpoint about three days away drifting on the river.
EM comms will be are under severe interference.

POUNCER ATTACK (See Creatures)
After the Pcs get settled a little bit, they will disturb a pouncer nest/den
somehow and the creatures will start to collect on the yacht in various
places.  9+1D6 pouncers will show up.  Once they outnumber the visible Pcs
they will attack always trying to get 3:1 odds, Ie 3 will attack one PC.

A Mist will surround them, it produces -1 to Observation  roll for every 1"
Some Pcs will think that they have drifted past the station.  While the mist
overlays the Brass Harpooners (See Creatures) will attack.

HARPOONER ATTACK
After a while 1d6 Brass Harpooners show up and try to grab any Pcs straying
near the edge of the deck.  Unless someone makes a difficult Observation
roll they will announce thier prescence with the shot of their harpoons
followed by the stun in the creatures next action..

The PCs should succesfully battle off the brass harpooners

They will not have passed the waystation and will pick it up quite easily.

WAYSTATION

The waystation will be deserted except for some spent shotgun shell casings
on the floor af the station.  The radio equipment will be nonfunctioning.
The door will have been smashed open and there is some blood around but no
bodies.  The dragons have been here. They carried off the four crewmembers. 
 
NATIVE CONTACT
After some aimless drifting, Pcs start to notice that someone is watching
them from shore and following the movement of the Yacht, eventually more and
more of these people join in following the yacht. Eventually a dragon much
bigger than the one the hunter shot can be seen stalking one of these
people. Then multiple dragons.  The dragon will only be seen if someone does
an infrared scan otherwise it just looks like a blur until it moves. i.e.
when it attacks.

The PCS may react to this however they choose.
In any event the dragons will massacre the locals without some serious
intervention


DRAGON ASSAULT
When the Yacht reaches a narrow portion of the river, 3+1D6 dragons will
attempt to jump onto it with a running start.  They will remain still and
invisible to normal sight until they make their pushed running attack.

They will start by trying to hit the occupants of the raft with mist clouds.
They will wait a few moments for this to take effect and then start trying
to jump onto the yacht. They will attack all Pcs insight.

The Pcs should remember that the Dragons are very vulnerable to sonic attacks.

However during the attack the Nemon agent will panic(if he\'s still alive)
and try to take off in the air raft One of the dragons will run in the back
door and attack him causing the air raft to crash into the trees/water/ or
back into the grav yacht effectively eliminating that avenue of escape.  




WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW MAN!!??!
Eventually EM comms will return the Pcs will notice this when Pecorin\'s
Satphone rings unless someone is monitoring the comms of the yacht.  Contact
will be made and after a few moments the Yachts position will be fixed by
the Comm Station.  They will ask about the status of the passengers, ETC, it
is probably getting near dark by this time and the Pcs will be growing
nervous.  Luckily the river is wide at this point and getting wider. If the
siren has been left on to scare away the dragons it will attract every brass
harpooner for miles.  Over time the Pcs may notice that the yacht is moving
slightly faster and faster.

After a few moments the Controllers will request to speak to the Pilot alone
by some sort of secret pilot talk.  Ie "Check Chart X-ray"  They will ask
him questions about the water conditions.They will notify him that the yacht
is 10+1d6 km from a significant waterfall Eventually the sound of the
waterfall can be heard as a distant rumble.
The Comm Station is about 400 km away, The ELT(Emergency Locator
Transmitter)  signal will have preceded the phone ring by 1d6*5 min It will
take the rescue raft about 10 min to preflight, at about 800 kph cruise,
1100 kph max it will take about 30+1d6*5 minutes for the rescue raft to
locate the yacht. 



The waterfall is about a 75-100 ft fall.  The current by this point is about
18 km/hr
The Pcs can resolve this in a number of ways

-Try to anchor the yacht somehow
-Try to get the thrusters going to stop the yacht or ram it into the side
-Try to bottom out the yacht (not a good idea)  Water will be 1m + 1d6m deep
-Get in the escape capsules and either ride it out or jettison themselves

In any event the rescue raft will show up and will eventually locate the
PCs. They will be picked up and flown back to the comm station where
injuries will be treated and a NeoSol Federation officer will debief them
and try to determine if they have knowledge of the gravitic pulse. They will
travel by shuttle to Kyranda watching the news learning of the pulse and
hearing about the loss of the yacht.  Media will be waiting for them on
their arrival at Kyranda.

AURIGAE
Aurigae is the 2nd Planet orbiting the star Mentor a yellow-greenish star. 
It has a radius of approxiametely  8,120 km and a surface gravity of 1.2g
(11.8 m/s/s) The atmosphere is composed of 30% oxygen and 68% Nitrogen and
2% other gasses
There are three principle continents and many groups of large islands.
 
DEMOGRAPHICS
90% of Aurigae\'s 100 million people live on the prime continent Kyran.
It is somewhat balkanized into three major states and several smaller ones.

The Union of Senled is a somewhat militaristic oligarchy of about 40 million
currently at war with the Nemon Republic.

The Kingdom of Arturon is a so called benevolent monarchy of about 12
million with a royal family and everything. The Prince will be on the trip.

The Nemon Republic is a small state of about 6 million which claims
independence from the Union of Senled.

Kyran States is a somewhat loose confederation of several states which are
themselve primarily representative democracies (at least officially)  The
largest state Alameda contains the City of Kyranda and the Starport.  Also
the NeoSol Federation reps office to Aurigae is in the city of Kyranda.

ISLAND CONTINENT OF ARRANDA 
This large Island Continent is largely unexplored wilderness.  There are
several small towns in contact with the "outside world" but the total
populations of these towns is about 100,000 .  An Unknown number of
indigenous people live in the wilderness areas of the Continent.  They have
psychologically and physically adapted to living here over the last 2000
years since their ancestors arrived on a crippled colonization ship.  

The town of Aubayn is the largest of these towns with a population of about
2,000 
These mainly consist of traders, sceintists, vacationers, and tourists and
the infrastructure to support them. There is a Research Stations located on
the outskirts of the town due to the great volume of Archaeological and
Biological research oppurtunities available in the wilderness.

The town is located on Beautiful lake Bitaiyn whose blue/green waters strech
for 100 km beyond the town.
 
There are wilderness stations loacted at regular intervals all over the
continent.  These are maintained by various States and Organizations as well
as one or two by the NeoSol Federation.

NEOSOL FEDERATION
The NeoSol Federation is a slowly expanding tightly knit group of worlds
whose capital is on the planet Prima which orbits the Star NeoSol.  Its
expansion policy is mainly one of self determination for would be members.
It however does agressively collect about activities on these worlds and
provides it to forces, groups which are favorable to it. It has a
significant intelligence and special ops presence on the planet of Aurigae.
It is average TL 11 with much TL 12 eqipment coming on line.

AUBAYN VERTIPORT
Is a relatively small facility located on the lake about 1 km from "downtown".
About one intercontinental grav leaves there a week.  There are flights
availabe within the continent from station to station.  There is a dropoff
area out front as well as a ticket office.  The waiting area is spacious and
has a very high ceiling with trees growing under the sun roof.  There is a
gangplank that leads out to the waiting Grav Yacht.

GRAV YACHT WILDERNESS VOYAGER
The WV is a relatively old and well used TL 10-11 50-ton grav yacht.  It
will cruise at 300kph buttoned up and has an endurance of 36 hrs.  It
carries a crew of six which includes the pilot,copilot 2 engineers and 2
stewards. It has a generous cargo capacity as well as staterooms for
passengers.  There are 2 large staterooms and 8 small staterooms plus
quarters for the crew.  Every stateroom is equipped with an entertainment
center in addition there is a quarterdeck/promenade that is quite spacious
6m x 8m as well as a dining room.  There are telescopic and IR viewers for
passenger entertainment.  Parasailing is available as well as an air raft
for excursions to the ground. There is a hot tub and small workout room.

damage of note (So you get bruised up a bit...) while both BD and CbtA are
vacc capable (at least in all the standard imperial versions, and their
direct relatives). Swords, cutlasses, shotguns, and accell pistols don\'t
generally penetrate (in TNE, most small arms don\'t), and these weapons are
designed for close combat, low collateral damage.

As for whole units, BDress (if you use the note from TD, I think around
issue 16 or later) gives superior endurance, field comfort (by comparison
to other armors), NBC Protection, and weather invulnerability (barring
direct lightning strike). Combat Armor is just as protective, but a whole
lot less useful. Especiallyt since it should be obvious that BDress can
operate comfortably under water, on land, in vaccum, and often in vaccum...

        is heavy enough to damage a spacecraft\'s or naval craft\'s integrity.
5)      Fire Support for "Traditional" infantry.

Pros of Battledress
1)      near-misses are pretty much inconsequential
2)      Shrapnel is of minimal to no threat, source dependant
3)      Heavy weapons can be easily carried and used
4)      Environmental protection
5)      Easier to learn to operate than combat walkers
6)      Very mobile
7)      Increased trooper endurance (especially with the "autopilot" on).
8)      Computer aided targeting increases effectiveness of fire. (optional)
9)      Psychological effects pronounced.
10)     very flexible mission spread (light armour, infantry, and man-pack arty
        missions all within reach of average BD Squad).
11)     Sense of self-security increases chances of useful engagement by
        armoured trooper.

Cons of BDress
1)      Expensive
2)      Requires some training
3)      obvious if trooper seen
4)      enemy battlesuits can carry weapons effective vs them...(See below)
5)      requires power source (usually fuel source)
6)      Slow to don/doff

THe argument that a defense is useless since it can be defeated  readily by
equally equipped troops is pure ^%%*%&... The increased survivablity versus
arty rounds, near misses, and vehicular secondary weapons makes the "Suits"
much more survivable overall on the "Traveller modern". Also, even though a
squad can wipe out it\'s equal number in suits, the ballance to other types
of units, combined with the greater environmental versatility, makes them
quite usefull to the Imperial Marines. And Plasma weapons are incredibly
lethal to non-suited targets even with a near miss, while Suited targets
have survivabilty (as a casualty) on a near miss. Shoot a Squad of normal
infantry with a Plasma Gun, and they all get hurt, often badly (TNE has
poor rules by comparison to the rest of Trav on this, but even so); hit a
trooper in a battlesuit (combat or Battle Dress) and you drop him, and
annoy his squadmates.

Tac Missiles (especially in TNE) are not so hot against man-sized
targets... the targets are too small in relation to their mobility
(especially if in grav belts) from a simple targeting point of view... AND
they are designed for shooting large targets, like tanks. Also, most tac
missile systems are one-shots, regaurdless of reusability.

However, it was more a case of we can construct *very* small

that).  Whether we have it 20 years or 80 years is not really the 
point - it was more a case of "look at technology now, and look at it 
in Traveller."  Regards to my comments upon Traveller as space-opera 
(which is something that I desperately do not want to see).  However, 
thanks for the reference /Backman, I shall endeavour to have a look 
at it.  Remember, for flame-reference, I\'m only a poor archaeologist 
;-)

A quick question that someone should be able to answer, prompted by 
my current reading of the powered-armour theme... is there no 
possibility of upping the endurance of the suits past the 10 hours 
produced in the various sourcebooks for the RC?  I haven\'t looked at 
the numbers yet, so it\'s a blind question.  Surely with all that 
space kicking around in battle dress - the heavier versions at least 
- you should be able to put some extra batteries in!?  I saw someone 
us a micro-fusion power plant for Tl-16 "Nemesis" Battle Dress, but 
surely you could just up the endurance by the extra batteries?  

As a point of interest, someone mentioned the cost of the modern 
soldier.  Apparently (can\'t validate it for various reasons) the 
concept of an armoured trooper is not that far off in the future.  
Topics which came up in the same conversation included, essentially, 
arm-mounted mini-guns with gyro-stabilisation, IHADSS (Integrated 
Helmet and Designated Sight System methinks, but don\'t quote me on 
it) for targeting, and that sort of thing.  Powered armour may be a 
bit more in the future, but where does Traveller put it?  12-14?  
What\'s that in our terms... another 150-200 years?  Early decades of 
this century were the estimates I heard given the rapid increase in 
military technology... not saying that I\'m an expert on it, though.

Again, thanks for listening to an arty-person rant about \'science.\'

.50 cal LIGHT Machine Gun?!?  A US army M2HB weighs over 100lbs *without*
ammo!  It is used either on vehicles or from a tripod, which weighs a ton
all on it\'s own.

The standard LMG of the US Army is the M-60.  A 7.62mm work horse based on
the German MG-42/44 series.  We have just adopted a new LMG, the M-240, but
I\'m not really aware of its characteristics yet.

The only way you could ever call a .50 light is if you were a body builder..

 Well, I tend to interpret it as "commerical viability" (for
 non-military tech) rather than "commonly available".  CV has an
 implication that (a) the technology is reliable enough for general
 use, and (b) the social, economic, and technological
 infrastructure is capable of sustained production of the item.
 Modifications to the TL (such as "early", "prototype", etc.)
 indicate things like "one or two \'countries\' can do this easily"
 or "it\'s really not yet CV, but we can see it Real Soon Now" or
 "we know we can do it economically, but it\'s not certain that the
 market will accept it".

 But no matter which of the three interpretations you put on it,
 the holocrystal storage (TL13) simply was not in the cards,
 according to the Standard Traveller Tech Progression. :)

 Oh, it doesn\'t _bother_ me, any more than reading the wildly \'off\'
 predictions for the \'90s that were written in the SF and Space
 Opera of the \'30s, \'40s, and \'50s.  I just get a bit of a giggle
 at how they underestimated our progress in some stuff, but
 overestimated it in others.

 A classic example of this is E.E.Smith\'s "Lensman" series - he
 mixes atomic-powered space ships having all the comforts of home
 with _mechanical_ calculating machines and databases that are
 essentially punched cards going through a sorter/collator.

 The only \'real\' negative about this is that it dates the product.
 It doesn\'t make it any less enjoyable...

 And we _did_ survive ten years of Traveller with computers
 comparable to ENIAC, didn\'t we?

******************************************************************************
CREATURES

BRASS HARPOONERS
I got the Idea from StarFlight II, if you have the game check out the
picture in the manual

Brass Harpooners, so called because of their metallic looking plated shells
and thegas propelled darts that they fire from their shells, are relatively
common in the forestrivers of the wilderness continent.  They are water
dwelling creatures as they have no means to propel themselves on land.  As
such an average adult weighs 500-600 kg and is 3-4 meters long. They have
limited eyesight through a vision "grouping" on the front portion of the
creature.  They however have extremely sensitive hearing especially
water transmitted sounds.  They are attracted by vibrations and can attack
based onthis alone due to the array of sound sensors on their shells.  This
however only works well inside about 12 meters.

Methods of attack are the harpoons which are fired by a violent gas
ejection. They are about 12 cm long and travel about 100 m/s.  Impactdamage
is equivalent to a 22LR or so.  However the creature can generate an extremely
powerful electrical discharge which is transmitted through a tentacle which
trails the harpoon.  It will disable even a strong person.  Think 60KV Stun
gun.  The creature also attacks by using its mass to crush , knock over.  It
isnt very fast and can only swim about 10 km/hr in spurts of about 5
seconds. Normal is 3-4 KPH.  The creature normally will drift or bottom out near
the shore and wait for a forest animal to come to the river.  It then shoots
it, Stuns it and drags it into the water.  The tough plating will stop a
light pistol round (i.e. 380ACP) and will significantly slow down a 9mmP
class round.  GMs should play on the fact that firing a gun is an invitation
to accurate attack within 12 meters or so.

	The harpoons, their are 4-6 on an adult, take about a week to grow back
once fired. 

The Brass Harpooners are fiercely protective of thier young and will break
off an assualt to protect any young of their kind.

*************************ARRANDA\'S DRAGON*********************************

This fearsome creature is known by many names, the name above is derived
from its primary continent of habitation.  This is what it is called by
those not native to the island continent.  The locals call them the
Invisible Ones or Mist Dragon depending on the translation.  This name is
derived from a peculiar ability to blend themselves in with the background
foliage.  This is similiar to a chameleons ability to do so but much more
evolved.  When standing still in the forest in low ambient light they will
be difficult at best to see, especially for someone not familiar with the
area.  To make matters worse they have the ability to spray an aerosol which
is a moderate depressant.  PCs so caught in the drifting cloud will have to
make a difficult test of constitution to keep their wits or initiative
depending on your game system.  It takes about 30 seconds for the depressant
to take effect and it lasts 20-40 seconds.  It basicly gives you a buzz.  In
fact the creature is more than capable of killing a human without this.This
bipedal  animal can
run in bursts up to 40 kph, weighs 250KG and has 4cm teeth and 8 cm slasher
claws.  Favorite attack on human sized prey is running over you.  You figure
out the math, 250kg at 40KPH with claws...well....ComEnvSuit wont do much
good even if you had one.

It can jump considerable distances with a running start.  About 4-5meteres
for every 10kph of run speed.

Although the creature has a tough hide, it is not bullet proof.  It is
possessed however of incredible toughness.  When in an attack frenzy it will
not be deterred by any wounds. No rules for panic for this creature.  You
have to kill it to stop it.  Treat the hide as mesh armor.  It is however
very vulnerable to loud high pitched sounds and will be driven away by such.
It also avoids bright light. However if wounded it will fly into a beserk so
that
it will ignore the light.  The PCs have no way of knowing the creatures
limitations unless they try things or one of the party is a specialist or a
local.


************************TREE POUNCER****************************************

These creature are small to medium sized quadrapeds that dwell primarily in
the canopies of the forest.  They are remarkable in that they have spearlike
beaks which they use to spear fish in their falling attacks from the
branches which overhang the water.  They weigh about 3-5 kg each and their
sharp beaks are about 12-15 cm long.  They have wide flat tails which they
use to control their descents to their targets sometimes as much as 100 ft
below. When they are fishing the splashes can be heard far along the river.
They cannot fly but are similiar to flying squirrels in that they can glide
great distances with great precision.  They use this ability to attack
treeborne and ground dwelling creatures as well.  They limit impact speeds
to about 20-30 kph so that they dont knock themselves silly.  This however
does occassionally occur. The creatures can climb rapidly up trees to regain
their attack posts.  They would never attack a larger creature except in
groups.  They communicate
with warbles and generally attack 3+1D6 per 100 kg of target mass.  Although
I assure you they dont weigh the prey.  I\'ll leave it up to your imagination
to determine the physical and psychological effect of small reddish
creatures flashing down from every direction trying to spear exposed
personnel with 5 inch blades.  They will not penetrate rigid armor but both
parties would probably be knocked silly.  The Pouncer would probably die.

The creature has a glide ratio of about 6:1  60 meteres on ground for every
10meteres above it.

In any event it\'ll give the PCs a chance to break out the shotguns in the
Wilderness Explorers survival locker.

Not to prolong the debate but there is already a dedicated TNE list,
TNE-RCES. Judging by the volume on it ( a message a month!? ) it isn\'t
much known about. The address is tne-rces@tower.clark.net and is run
by "Mario M. Butter" <mbutter@tower.clark.net>.

Even better, try the RPG Albedo, based on the _Erma Felna_ comic.  The 
Interstellar Lupine Republic is a racist splinter government, based on the 
premise that rabbits are the superior lifeform.  They are locked in a cold 
(but getting warmer) war with the Confederation government, a collection of 
several species.  All the species are genengineered from Terran animals, for 
reasons unknown to the characters.

This RPG actually has a very hard science background, and is worth purchasing 
just for that.  I even prefer the Albedo jump drive explanation over 
Traveller\'s...

5.56mm, based on the FN Minimi, either belt fed from drums or uses M16 magazines
without modification, adopted as the squad automatic weapon (SAW). Canada and
one or two other NATO nations use it as well. The M60 is retained at platoon
level, I believe.

    'body' => 'Well, the way I see it, you pretty much have to equip assualt forces
for *any* "reasonable" environment. So, that *alone* almost requires
*some* armor. After all, an environment suit with a hole in it is
pretty useless. 

As for landing assualt troops, I recommend a quick read of "Starship
Troopers" by Heinlein. His description of a drop sounds like it\'d work
even in Traveller. 

Basicly, the troops in their powered armor are launched from the ships
in one man expendable capsules. They\'ve got some ablative shielding for
reentry, and the shell is in layers. The layers are designed to "peeel
back and thus slow the capsule. Also, the peeled off layers give a lot
more targets for the folks on the ground to track. "ribbon" chutes are
used to make some major *sudden* slowdowns. The idea is that the chute
bleeds off a lot of velocity *fast, then gets dumped, leaving the
capsule falling ballisticly, just like all the shed pieces, dummy
capsule, orbital artillery rounds, etc. 

After the final layer of capsule is shed, the trooper has a final
parachute, as well as the armor\'s "jump jets". 

A typical "Mobile Infantry" (MI) raid has them getting dropped in
some "pattern" around a target. The MI spread havoc as the pattern
changes to a circle around the recovery point. By this time they\'ve
hopefully cleared things enough for a shuttle to drop in an get them.

For an actual *invasion*, the shuttles would be landing supplies and
heavy equipment. 

But a few MI raids on industrial and political targets will tend to
impress upon the other side the idea that while *invading* them may not
be practical, it\'s still possible to cause them a world of hurt. 

As an example, while it may not be practical to invade the US, picture
a similar sort of raid on Detroit, or Washington DC. The "paratroppers
come in, lay waste to a bunch of important stuff, and get out. Sure, we
could survive that sort of thing for a *long* time. But it\'d disrupt
the government and economy. 

Sort of like bee stings. While bee stings won\'t kill most people, we\'ll
go a fair amount out of our way to avoid getting stung!

Another nasty possiblity in areas where both sides are the same species
is having the folks come in in *stealthed* capsules and join up with
either the local "resistance" or with guerilla/"terrorist" groups on
"their" side. It isn\'t an invasion, but...

Oh yeah, the reason for using MI rather than orbital bombardment is
simple enough. A man on the scene is almost always going to be more
selective than even a "smart" weapon.

To go back to the example of raiding the US, sure, you can nail things
like dams from orbital. Even some industrial and military targets. But
in many cases, you\'ll want to go in and destory something that may be
surrounded by civilians that you\'d rather *not* hurt (the old bit about
"we are attacking your *government*, not you").

In Traveller, some of these things are going to be harder to pull off.
But I rather suspect that the capability is *still* going to be useful.
So Battle Dress will exist. And it\'s more likely to be used by
interstellar powers than by planetary ones.

First of all, given the availability of fusion power and the like,
water will *not* be a problem. *Especially* for folks in environment
suits. The human body *produces* more water than it consumes. In the
various suits, you can trap this and dump the resulting "waste" into a
reprocessor. Fusion distilling water out of various wastes isn\'t going
to be a problem. Not even psychologically. 

Food is *always* a problem, so that isn\'t going to change much.

Air can be recycled, and again, with fusion power, you can reprocess it
indefinitely. 

Ammo and fuel get interesting. *Most* "fuel" for non-spacraft is
effectively infinite. And the same goes for ammo for energy weapons.

Expect any planetary assualt forces to use projectile weapons *only*
when needed, because there\'s a limit to how much ammo they can bring
for them. But the lasers, PAWS, and meson weapons are limited only be
available power.

This also explains *why* anyone would bother with mass drivers and
gauss weapons. They use energy for propellant, and the projectiles can
easily be fabricated from materials on site. As an example, I can see
all the damaged/destroyed enemy equipment getting dragged to the ammo
fab module and getting turned into projectiles to be fired back at them!
Ditto for any of your *own* gear that is too damaged to be worth
fixing on site. 

And there\'s always the structural steel etc in the "unimportant"
buildings in the city you just fought thru.

With this in mind, I expect that the weapons mix for invasion forces
and for any merc or military unit expected to do much in the way of
"independent operation" to be a *lot* different than we\'ve been seeing.

Any decent sized merc group will probably be able to maintain
everything except their ships *themselves*. And all they\'ll need in the
way of supplies (other than "raw materials") will be food and medical
supplies. 

The various interstellar powers will likely have groups with similar
capabilities for extended operations away from a base. They may even go
so far as to have mobile refit yards for ships at the fleet level. Such
a fleet could probably keep going as long as they had hydrogen and were
able to find asteroids or planets to "mine" for materials. 

Picture having a fleet like *that* operating behind enemy lines. The
one vulnerable spot would be the mobile refit yards and manufacturing
facilities. And since they\'d *have* to be capable of rebuilding their
own gear, they could duplicate *that* one their own, removing the
"single point" failure.

Now picture the Virus getting hold of one of these....

Two points on this experiment:

1. What value did you place on the troopers themselves?  If you start the
cost of each soldier at say, 3 years pay plus training alowance, the ratios
for battledress improve somewhat.

2. What value did you place on mobility and tactical employment?  With a
unit of battledress I have a lot more options then you do with your
near-naked groundpounders.  Experimients based on lining the participents up
and letting fly do not do much to refelect actual combat potential (if they
did, the longbow yould have been the dominent infantry weapon until
somewhere in the 1840\'s).  Don\'t forget morale as well. Large scale
battledress formations well handled are likely to be very scarry things.

I would suggest that battledress a bloody useful pretty much all of the
time, and that (Commons Committees to the contrary) equipment cost is a
minor part of the equation in determining the appropriate TOE.

so does getting someone to the point where he is willing to stick his head

I would say somewhat less conceilable that naked trooper, but it should
require less cover to conceal than, say, a tank; and I understand that well
handled tanks can come oout of nowhere in a quire disquiting style.  Should
be able to crawl into a hole only slightly larger than required for regular
troops -- and should be able to dig said hole far faster.

>4)      enemy battlesuits can carry weapons effective vs them...(See below)

Much like the modern point that the best anti-tank weapons are, in fact, tanks.

Again, my point is that non-battledress infantry are without merit in all
situations, or that battledress troops cannot be defeated by same, but that
offensive firepower per equipment credit  is not the only measure for
evaluating a TOE.

If someone wants to try reffing a game using, say, striker II style rules, I
would be happy to play the battledress side in some tactical experiments.

	I don\'t remember this being true in previous incarnations of 
Traveller, and I don\'t know if it\'ll be true in the next, but in TNE, I 
recently noticed that when in BD your Environment Suit skill replaces 
your controlling asset (str, agl, etc.) when attempting physical tasks.  
That means that your average marine will have to have _6_ skill levels in 
Env Suit before he becomes as effective in BD as out.  Even if you don\'t 
go that far, a skill level of 4 seems the bare minimum.  A marine with 
gun cbt of 2 (what basic gives him) and a Env Suit skill of 4 would only 
have an asset of 6!  He\'s not going to hit much.
	The bottom line is that using this rule, it takes several terms 
before a marine is skilled enough in gun cbt, parachute, & env suit to be 
able to do the classic meteoric assault.  So these troops must be made up 
almost exclusively of NCOs, making them very expensive troops indeed.
	What was that line from "Starship Troopers?"  Something about a 
soldier having to be as skilled as a master in any other trade?  It\'s 
certainly true in the case of power armor troops jumping from orbit, who 
were, after all, inspired by Heinlein in the first place.

Actually, it\'s the M-249 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon), built to bridge the
gap between the M-16 Assault Rifle and the M-60 GPMG.  The Fire Team member
in the position of automatic rifleman generally carries it.  The M-60 is

strong well equiped determined force becomes much easier if you don\'t care
about the status of the world afterwords.  In other words you can bomb them
into the stone age.  Another possibility that I was considering was the
concept of planet hopping like the U.S. did in the Pacific Theatre in WWII.
Only land on the worlds you HAVE to control.  Blockade the others (wipe out
local Navy, then bomb startports to smithereens, leave a smaller holding
force behind).  Then you will be free to concentrate the majority of your
forces on the critical worlds.  

This works esp well on planets that cannot support themselves without
external aid.  A few well placed ortillery barrages to take out the
Atmosphere Processors etc. can hurry along the surrender.

Lastly I have gotten the impression that Imperial Citizens for the most part
cared very little about who ruled them as it seemed to effect them very
little.  This only changed with the onset of the "Black War".  So
generations had lived under the pretense that warfare was much like the 18th
century limited between military forces only, minimal collateral damage etc.
They were concerned about the outcome of a planetary assault but felt that
they would not feel the effects too much.  The thought never really crossed
their minds to go out at toss Molotov Cocktails on Grav Tanks or Battle
Dress Troopers.

    'body' => 'The M-240 SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon) is a 5.56N weapon with a 200rnd
casete magazine (actaully a belt in a casette but who quibling).  It has a
longer and heavier barrel than the M-16, and has a higher muzzle velocity
and muzzle energy than the M-16.  All told it weighs in at 10Kg I think (I
remeber reading that it weighs the same w/ 200rnds of ammo as a M-60 weighs
empty).

As for fire efficency it is not a s good as an M-60 but the current trend in
Military Weapons if for lighter stuff.  It will still wound or kill an
opponent at just shorter ranges thatn the M-60, but is much lighter.  BTW: I
don\' think you can swap barrels on it like you could on the 60, thus further
reducing the weight carried into battle.

As for powered armor in the near furture, Many of the light electronic
features of BD are coming soon: Night Vision, Computer assisted Aiming,
Heads-Up Displays, individual radio commo, etc.  If you look at the weight
of these things, the are negligible compared to weapons and armor.  Armor
especially if you want protection from small arms completely.  The only
solution seems to be to power the armor, but power density by current
standards is fairly low, and trying to build artiulating powered walkers
would be a daunting task, esp as it would require gyro stabilization to
stand and walk.  It would be slow large, and unable to go prone or really
dodge.  It would make more sense to make small 1 person vehicles (wheeled,
ACV, etc).  Then we are talking about a vehicle again.

Powered armour walks the fine line (pun intended) between a suit of armour
and a vehicle.  Battle Dress only makes sense in a world like Traveller with
TL-12+.  The servos and motors needed to run somehting like that then to
allow full range of motion like BD is supposed to do are a LONG ways off.  

BD heightens individual survivability but it also reduces the number of
members like it.  In the Civil War, Platoons were larger than they are
today.  The typical combat unit was the Regiment about 500+ soldiers.  In
WWI and WWII it became the company about 200 soldiers.  In Viet Nam the unit
was the Platoon of less than 50 soldiers.  The reson for this is that in US
military doctrine, we have fewer and fewer soldiers to use, therefore we
equip them much better, then give them more autonomy to make decisions.  It
worked in Desert Storm, but how well in Viet Nam.  Imgaine a whole planet
like Viet Nam with staunch defenders that are using weapons inferior but in
settings where they can be used to great advantage.  REmember the U.S.
started out that war using the M-14 and issuing flack jackets to almost
every troop.  By then end it was the M-16 and no body armor.  Tactics have
to change with the terrain and enemy.  

In the Traveller Universe I always used the Squad as the seminal unit for
combat ops.  10 troopers with all integral support weapons needed.  This
might mean for a TL-14/15 group.  BD for all troops (CBT armour if not a BD
unit).  Then standard weapons for 6, Support weapons for 2, and Specialty
weapns for 2.  An example might be 6 in CBT armour, with 4 Gauss Rifles and
2 Laser Rifles.  2 Plasma Rifles or RAM GL or Hvy Laser Autoweapon.  Finally
2 dedicated to Anti Vehicle/Anti Air with either Tac Missles or a Rapid
Pulse Small PD Plasma Weapon.  Each trooper would carry small explosives
like Hand Grenades, etc.  The end result is a group of troopers that can
deal intense destruction and fight to a limited extent against any oposition.

The main mistake many GMs make is to disregard the fact that most units are
vary varried in their composition to deal with multiple threats.  Many Gms
fall into the D&D( thats Dangerous Dimensions) mold of eqioping all villians
with the same weapons.  The average trooper might be, but only about 50-60%
of troopers are average in modern military (I mean specifically combat units
not incuding the fact that all support units have pretty much only M-16s for
use).  The other mistake is to forget that almost 50% of a modern military
army is support troops. 

Oh well I rambled again.  I hope that this is realtively coherent.

	Keep in mind though that having all those support units turning 
asteroids into BSD and old vehicles into bullets are going to require a 
lot of personnel and equipment of their own, making them rather expensive 
and difficult to move around.  The transport and whatnot required for all 
these non-combatants is likely to be a real impediment to independent 
operation of its own.
	I could see equiping a unit with energy weapons and rigging all 
their vehicles to run on hydrogen to minimize logistics burdens, and I 
think that this is a good idea that I might play around with.  
	But equipping units with their own raw materials processing and
manufacturing capability is less of a good idea.  Credit for credit, man
for man, a "traditional" unit will be able to put more firepower onto the
battlefield.  You make a good point that the ability to "live of the land"
would be very useful and I agree, I just think less costly ways might be
found of doing that.  You already mentioned using energy weapons and so
on.  A unit could also use weapons that take relatively "low tech"
ammunition so that it could resupply from captured local industry.  If
your opponent is practicing a "scorched earth" strategy or you are a
purely raiding force that won\'t be able to use local sources of supply,
something like what you describe makes sense.

	I just don\'t think that building hi-tech goods on the fly is that 
easy.  Think about it this way:  no matter how good easily reproducable 
and mobile ship yards are, immobile, non-reproducable ones are likely to 
be better simply because they\'re more specialized and devote all their 
resources to building ships rather than moving around, reproducing 
theselves, etc.  So there will still be a trade-off for equiping your 
units with all this mobile manufacturing rather than relying on fixed 
manufacturing and using the savings for combat assets.
	In the end, I think we can both agree that going with lower-tech 
but rugged and easily maintained gear will always be a viable strategy 
for units operating a long way from their sources of supply.

But I rather suspect that the capability is *still* going to be useful.
So Battle Dress will exist. And it\'s more likely to be used by
interstellar powers than by planetary ones. <<

I think part of the difference between Traveller and the scenario postulated by
Heinlein is that the MI didn\'t experience particularly heavy orbital defences
and once down were effectively operating in open ground except when they went
into the bug tunnels, even then they could use the surface for mobility and pick
their point of entry into the tunnels; whereas in Traveller the major targets
for the Solomani or the Imperial factions are high population worlds, with
potentially continent size cities.

Planetary assaults against this kind of target are going to see the warships go
in first to take out the orbital defenses and the deep meson sites, then you
have to carve your way through the COACC defenses, possibly by inserting your
own air-superiority craft (AKA Intrepids), only then do you really have a safe
window for a drop troop assault, though you could risk it in the first wave if
you don\'t mind the odd division or brigade lost when a terajoule range meson
site guts their assault carrier. The drop troops are pretty much on their own
until COACC has been disposed of, in that time they have to size a bridgehead/
landing site, and the only open space big enough may well be the most heavily
defended - the starport - so the drop troops have to be able to do the most
damage possible in a small package, and that means powered armour and the best
weapons money can buy. 

Once you have your bridgehead secured you can start landing leg infantry into
it, but then you face expanding outwards, and that battle is going to be
Stalingrad on a planetary scale. Intrepids and Imperial Marine APCs may be
superb cavalry platforms in open country, but they aren\'t much use for
room-to-room fighting in the interiors of an arcology. The side that wins in the
end will be the one that can generate the greatest density of firepower at the
point of contact, and a platoon of Intrepids is no use whatsoever if they
physically can\'t get through to the interior, so again powered armour may be the
weapon of choice, though likely with lots of cheap combat armoured types to
screen for it. In the end terrain determines tactics, and tactics determines the
technology you deploy.

Well, um, any attacker at TL10+ isn\'t going to have assault choppers,
you do better with grav vehicles.  If your vehicles are not designed
to be rapidly brought into use in an assault landing, then you
need to use larger weapons on your design teams ;-)

Having spent a lot of time and effort on my orbital assault capability
for a recent strategic game, I can say it\'s not easy.  But your hardware
should be ready on landing.  I even designed up expendable drop landers
for putting heavy equipment down in large quantities and fast...

And a lot of people just design a tank or two and leave things at that.
Look hard at something like Tom Clancy\'s "Armored Cav" or even Striker II;
there are lots of different vehicles there, each has a reason.  You should
have infantry, tanks, artillery, medical, supplies, repair vehicles,
probably a portable lab for expeditions offplanet, command vehicles,
staff vehicles, ...

82 lbs without ammo.  60 lb tripod, I think.  The M2HB basic mass I am

M-249 is the new 5.56mm SAW/LMG.  M-240 is the designation for the FN-MAG
7.62 machinegun for tank use.  The M-249 isn\'t very new.

Even better, try the RPG Albedo, based on the _Erma Felna_ comic.  The

First of all, given the availability of fusion power and the like,
water will *not* be a problem. *Especially* for folks in environment

Food is *always* a problem, so that isn\'t going to change much.

Air can be recycled, and again, with fusion power, you can reprocess it
indefinitely.

Ammo and fuel get interesting. *Most* "fuel" for non-spacraft is

Yes, The logistics load increases to about TL9 and then starts to decrease.

This also explains *why* anyone would bother with mass drivers and
gauss weapons. They use energy for propellant, and the projectiles can
easily be fabricated from materials on site. As an example, I can see
all the damaged/destroyed enemy equipment getting dragged to the ammo

Ditto for any of your *own* gear that is too damaged to be worth

Two points on this experiment:

1. What value did you place on the troopers themselves?  If you start the
cost of each soldier at say, 3 years pay plus training alowance, the ratios
for battledress improve somewhat.

near-naked groundpounders.  Experimients based on lining the participents up
and letting fly do not do much to refelect actual combat potential (if they
did, the longbow yould have been the dominent infantry weapon until
somewhere in the 1840\'s).  Don\'t forget morale as well. Large scale
battledress formations well handled are likely to be very scarry things.
 ----

Longbows required too much training!

BD troopers can carry weapons and sensors that will significantly outrange 
those of the groundpounders.
Also they can use their mobility to concentrate and outmaneuver their enemy.
Much of the time the groundpounders would get hit before they saw the BD 
coming!

I would suggest that battledress a bloody useful pretty much all of the
time, and that (Commons Committees to the contrary) equipment cost is a
minor part of the equation in determining the appropriate TOE.
 ----

Well, when the cost difference is 10-100 times...

undeniable, but always add cost of base troper

Cost effectiveness is the only criterion, based on the particular mission 
being fulfilled.
(BD troops are _definitely_ better for the invading force.)

 ----
>3)      obvious if trooper seen

I would say somewhat less conceilable that naked trooper, but it should
require less cover to conceal than, say, a tank; and I understand that well
handled tanks can come oout of nowhere in a quire disquiting style.  Should
be able to crawl into a hole only slightly larger than required for regular
troops -- and should be able to dig said hole far faster.
 ----

Also actually _less_ likely to be spotted due to better sensors capable of 
being carried and the use of chameleon surfaces. The groundpounder is going 
to get spotted first...
Also the BD can do things like sit on the bottom of waterways or completely 
bury themselves.

 ----
>4)      enemy battlesuits can carry weapons effective vs them...(See below)

Much like the modern point that the best anti-tank weapons are, in fact, 
tanks.

Again, my point is that non-battledress infantry are without merit in all
situations, or that battledress troops cannot be defeated by same, but that
offensive firepower per equipment credit  is not the only measure for
evaluating a TOE.

If someone wants to try reffing a game using, say, striker II style rules, I
would be happy to play the battledress side in some tactical experiments.
 ----

Yep, and I\'ll take the other side as long as I can get vehicle support. ;)
BD troopers are the only ones at high tech that can carry AT weapons that 
are effective and remain mobile without vehicular support.

What is Traveller?              (all in my humble opinion...
----               jimv@empirenet.com)

Traveller is a science fiction roleplaying game originally
published by Game Designers\' Workshop (GDW) back in the late 70s.
As the first well-supported RPG of its genre, it drew a large
following which continues to "hang on" even through the recent
demise of GDW.

The initial version of the game, which many enthusiasts dubbed
"Classic Traveller" (CT), consisted not only of a set of rules
but also of an official campaign setting. This background
postulated the Imperium, a large human dominated empire
consisting of thousands of star systems, as well as several alien
nations outside the imperial aegis. One of the main draws of the
Traveller RPG was this background material which was long-held to
be some of the most in-depth campaign-fodder anywhere in the
roleplaying games publishing industry. An even more interesting
feature of this background was that it wasn\'t frozen in any
particular time period. As real time went by, so too did time
flow in the official game setting, so that the setting itself
evolved over time as major events (wars, assassinations) took
place.

Players would typically play characters who were interstellar
merchants or mercenaries, jumping from star system to star system
trying to make enough money to finance their ship. Eventually, a
war occurred between the Imperium and another human dominated
government, disrupting commerce and tending to put the characters
into ever more dangerous predicaments. This war, though it was
stalemated, eventually led to a rebellion within the Imperium,
which became the background for Traveller\'s next edition, called
MegaTraveller (MT).

As might be expected, many Traveller players were a little miffed
about the Imperium suddenly ripping itself apart. They had
already set up their campaigns around the idea of a relatively
stabile empire and didn\'t want to suddenly change everything
simply because GDW had decided to make a drastic change to the
setting. Traveller also became somewhat neglected during these
years (as evidenced, in part, by the exceptionally poor
proofreading of the key MegaTraveller books). The rules were also
rather complicated (although the task-system was hailed as a
success) and GDW\'s support of the game was rather sporadic.
Fortunately, a company by the name of Digest Group Publications,
which had its roots as a Traveller fanzine, look the lead in
developing support material for the game so that it didn\'t die
altogether.

Somehow, the GDW/DGP partnership seemed to dissolve, however, and
GDW finally came up with a third attempt, this one called
Traveller: The New Era (or "The New Error", a name conjured by
those who worried that the proofreading might be as dismal as
Traveller\'s former incarnation). In this setting, the great
Imperial rebellion was at an end. What ended it was not human
common sense so much as human ingenuity. Someone had engineered a
very intelligent computer virus, and the virus was taking over
various worlds and killing the inhabitants. Suddenly the war-
effort was no longer so important as mere survival.

Although reminiscent of Twilight 2000, another game by GDW
dealing with global holocaust, The New Era (TNE) involved the
rediscovery of forgotten worlds and hence concentrated on
exploration much more than its two predecessors. Further, the
character generation system was expanded and streamlined and
generally hailed as a success.

Of course, those Traveller players who disliked the idea of a
shattered Imperium even less liked the idea of a dead one.
However, there were many players who liked the exploration aspect
of TNE which the prior versions of Traveller had seemed to miss.
Hence, the fact that the Traveller-audience is now fragmented
into groups that play in the classic setting, others that play in
the rebellion setting, and still others that play in the new era,
can be viewed simultaneously as both a weakness and as a
strength.

Traveller\'s next edition, still unnamed, is to be published by
Imperium Games, a new company founded by Marc Miller who was
Classic Traveller\'s original designer. Many players look forward
to this new edition which promises to bring even more diversity
and gaming possibilities to the official Traveller setting by
exploring other historical eras.

I don\'t have FF&S but I have talked with folks who work with the real

While it\'s true that you can\'t just take a random hunk of metal and
shape it to produce a round, it won\'t be *that* much harder except for
the hypervelocity weapons, where you have problems with the round
*flowing* under its own weight.

FF&S may be using "fancy" rounds. But a gauss rifle that fires solid
"needles" at 5000 fps or so is easily doable with "near future" tech.
And making it able to work with a variety of metals isn\'t much harder.

Yes, you can magnetically accelerate *non-ferrous* metals. It just
requires a *changing field, not a steady one. And in fact, the "rail
gun" type setup is actually quite insensitive to what the projectile is
made of. It just has to be conductive.

So for this type of "gauss rifle" you could use *current* tech to put
"in the field" ammo manufacture into the back of a small van! Give that
you need some tools and the like for the unit armorer to do maintenance
on weapons anyway, having this as part of a support vehicle at the
company (or lower) level isn\'t *that* much of a stretch.

All it amounts to is something for chopping metal up into workable size
chunks, and then forcing the chunks thru wire drawing dies. Then the
pieces of wire get die formed into rounds. Sure, it\'s crude. and you
could improve it in several different ways. But it\'d *work*, and it\'d
be pretty rugged.

For the bigger mass drivers, things get a bit more complicated, I
agree. Then again, anything above squad support weapons is probably
better as energy/plasma weapons, except where you need indirect fire
weapons. And most current uses of *those* are better served by
ortillery.

thanked me for doing the survey, and to you I say "you\'re welcome and 
thanks".  Now here are the results (drum roll please): 

There were 63 total votes.  According to Rob Miracle, there are over 500 
individual addresses which subscribe to the list, so we may not have 
quorum, but here\'s the breakdown of the votes:

Option	 Votes	Percentage
1	 5	(08.0%)				
2	 6	(09.5%)			
3	 3	(04.8%)
4	 2	(03.2%)
5	23	(36.5%)
6	 2	(03.2%)
7	15	(23.8%)
8	 7	(11.1%)

In the likely event that you didn\'t memorize what the options were, 
here\'s a recap:

1. Leave Traveller and Xboat alone, create new mailing list for New
Traveller.

2. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Xboat.

3. Leave lists as are, but discuss New Traveller on Traveller.

4. Leave lists as are, and discuss New Traveller on either/both.

5. Create single list for all game versions.

6. Create several lists divided by topic, such as technology, history,
rules, etc.

7. Create new list for TNE, discuss New Traveller on Traveller, and leave
Xboat for CT/MT.

8. Other (please specify).

Option 5 was the clear winner, though 7 may be a closer second than it 
seems, since option 1 was very similar (only the names of the lists are 
changed) and individuals voting for one often indicated in comments that the 
other was also a preference.

Most of the option 8 voters were calling for a "wait and see when NT 
comes out" approach, though there were one or two calls for instituting a 
news group instead.

For those of you who sent in votes in an improper format, rest assured 
that I did go through your messages and included your indicated 
preferences in the survey.

I have not had time to do any stats on the numbers above to see what the 
confidence limits are or anything like that, but I may do so within the 
next week or so.


NOW FOR THE EDITORIAL PORTION OF OUR PROGRAM:

There seems to be a split between two major groups here, which I will 
call the Fractionalists and the Unionists (Fracs and Unis for short).  
The Fracs seem to think that it is a logical progression to go from 2 
lists for two game versions to 3 lists for three game versions.  The 
problem of cross posting does not concern them as much as it does the 
Unis.  The Unis want everyone to be one happy family and get everything 
back together again.  The Unis hate redundant postings.

Personally, I put myself in the Frac camp, and prefer option 7 or option 1
(three lists for CT/MT, TNE, and NT, respectively).  My main reasons for
this are as follows: 

1. One big list (i.e., option 5 or the Unis position) would lead to
confusion in new players, who would be confronted with a list where 50-75% of
the material would not be about the version of the game they just bought. 
They would have to figure out the whole history the Traveller game
versions and then sift through to find the NT material they were
interested in. 

2. One big list would result in very large digests which would contain a
great deal of information irrelavant to anyone\'s particular favorite game
version.  For instance, I do not want to have to sift through a bunch of
FF&S designs to get to the CT/MT/NT stuff that interests me, and I\'m sure
there are others who just the opposite.  Also, individuals paying for
storage would have to pay extra for information they don\'t want. 


Having said that, I could live with the Unionist option if some rules 
were instituted along the following lines:

1. All messages would be clearly labelled as to which game versions they 
applied to.  A prefix system might be one way to do it:  CT/MT, TNE, NT, or 
ALL would go before the message title.

2. All messages would have to have a title.  No more "Re: Traveller 
Digest 666" or similar vague subject lines.

3. Quoting previous messages would be limited.  No more pasting in 5 
generations of replies on a particular topic.

4. Any message which was over a particular length would be labelled as 
LONG in the title.

5. Flame wars would be quickly extinguished or moved to personal email 
addresses.

If we are going to have one list only for all Traveller versions, then I 
would suggest that the TML FAQ have an article (similar to one posted 
recently) explaining the history of the game.  Another idea would be a 
list of often used acronyms (e.g., TML and FAQ :-), so that newbies would 
not feel lost.

Well, that\'s all the ramble I got in me.  
Comments? Criticisms? Ranting Flames?

I\'m new to the Traveller Digest as well as to the Xboat Digest so I am not
familiar with any previous treads that may have been exhausted. I have a
question regarding what may be one such "expired" subject:

Who sets up and runs a starport? From what I can learn from the various
sourcebooks available to me, starports are considered to be local affairs.
A planetary government or a company (or a combination of the two) are
responsible for the construction and maintenance of a starport. But how
does this mesh with TL. I mean, you can get a, say, A starport on a TL-7
world. How can that world conduct overhauls on TL-15 craft (or construct
starships for that matter)? Do they rely on imported parts, materials, and
machinery? If so, what if the nearest world with TL 15 were located far
(15+ parsecs) away? Wouldn\'t that affect prices?

I hope somebody can help me out.

Maybe I\'m a bit dim but what does "USMC adopted this gun, army guys use
that gun, my gun is bigger than your gun=8A" et c has to do with Traveller?
If you\'re about to discuss guns please confine yourself to gundesingns in
Traveller, 3G^3 et c as this nitpicking on contemporary gun use is
uninteresting to me and (probably) most subscribers.
There\'s probably lots of mailing lists for military types and gun freaks in

The main difference between what is "doable today" and Traveller\'s version of
gauss weaponry in the future lies in energy consumption.  Today\'s mass drivers
must energize sections of the "barrel" one at a time to accelerate a projectile,
timing the switching via computer.  FF&S\'s design incorporates the projectile
into the electric circuit which creates the magnetic field, allowing the weapon
to more accurately localize the field.  As the round moves forward, so does the
circuit, and so does the resulting magnetic field.  By creating such a localized
field, energy consumption goes way down and portability becomes possible.

FF&S is talking about an extremely refined version of the mass driver technology
available today.  Just as a piece of magnetite (or loadstone) makes a fairly
decent magnet, wrapping it around an iron core improves its efficiency by quite
a bit.

I see these discussions as a way to bring greater depth to the game.

realistic guns.

When I was doing the research for the RPG I wrote seven years ago (which 
was never published - I\'ll write a post about that sometime), I ended up 
delving into a lot of weaponry and armor research.  None of the 
literature I perused on this subject was specificially for RPG\'s, yet 
reading them improved my understanding of combat paraphanalia.  This, in 
turn, improved the role-playing experience for me and my players.

I vote for continued non-flame discussions of weaponry.

I\'ll try to be a bit clearer on the subject. It\'s OK to talk about
contemporary gunperformance, weight et c of course and yes it is absolutely
necessary to have real world(tm) data in order to make a gun design system
to work. What I don\'t think is the tiniest bit interesting is what gun USMC
are using or when the Gurkhas replaced their M-16 or watever. This is
historical info for T2000 guys perhaps but TOTALLY useless to Traveller
GMs. Try to understand what I\'m getting at here before flaming me.

PS If somebody on the list is interested in real world(tm) formulae for
explosion pressure, penetration that are used by Rheinmetall in designing
real guns please let me know. DS

	I hope you don\'t think my previous message was a flame.  I 
certainly didn\'t mean to appear abusive.  Rather, I merely voiced my own, 
opposing, opinion.  I certainly didn\'t mean to appear to lambast you.
	Further, I do understand what you are getting at.  However, I see 
the knowledge of what current military units use in various situations 
(ie, submarines and ground combat) as being translatable into the 
Traveller universe.  
	This is just my opinion, and I don\'t begrudge you yours.

	Explosives are a somewhat less-covered topic in most RPGs.  
I think it would be good to know more about them.  If you have the time, 
please do post it.

I hope we don\'t get into a flamewar about this.  I have no objection to
discussion about weaponry on the list - after all it plays a large part in
many Traveller campaigns.  However, as with many threads, I think
we ought to keep an eye on the relevance of what we post to
Traveller.  There comes a point when some threads have moved
away from their origins considerably, and, while interesting, do not
have that much to do with Traveller.  In cases like that, maybe the
particpants should think about moving the discussion to e-mail.

An analogy would be a discussion which starts off discussing grav
vehicles in Traveller, then moves to discussing lower tech transport,
which moves on to discussing 20th century Terran transport which
then moves on to comparing the Ferrari with the Lamborghini.
Fascinating for all the fans, not so much so for everyone else.

I am aware that there is probably a cultural split between posters in
the US and posters in Europe.  Quite simply, the number of people
interested in guns as a hobby or interest is far less in Europe than
it is in the States, for a whole variety of reasons, not least of which
are the differences in availability and legality.  As a result, discussions
which centre too much on Real World gun discussions, as opposed
to Traveller gun discussions, tend not to be so interesting to some
members of the list from outside the US.  An analogy would be
some list members from Europe discussing governmental
structures in Traveller, using the European Union as examples of
governmental structures, and then ending up talking about what
is essentially European politics rather than Traveller.

I\'m not trying to start a flame war, and I do not wish to offend anybody\'s
views on issues relating to guns.  I\'ve tried to keep my personal
views on the subject out of this deliberately so as not to perpetuate
the argument I am concerned this could slide into.  I just wanted to
offer a small plea for consideration amongst all sides of the views of
the others.

My, that all sounded awfully serious.  Anyone got any views on
a less contentious subject such as hurling rocks at planets,
feudal technocracy or the scientific plausibility of the Virus?   ;-)

   Probably fans of Dr. Who type sci-fi in which only the bad guys
regularly carry firearms.

   One things for sure, not all science-fiction revolves around in depth
character studies, mystery solving, or ray guns that make people glow
white hot for a second then disappear.  Certainly Traveller never did.

   I would like to second that opinion.  To put together any kind of table
of organization and equipment for military units in the 57-58th century,
you must examine how such units are organized today and why.  Part
of that examination must include a look at weaponry, because the types
of weapons carried and what they are actually used for gives you
valuable insights you otherwise would not get.  For example, knowing
what several rows of 16 foot long pikes will do to a determined charge
mounted by armored knights helps you understand why pike formations
were bunched so closely together.  This also helps you understand the
logic of the close infantry formation used up until WW I (massed fire can
be just as devastating as running up on pikes).  

   OK, so apply this to Traveller you say.  At TL 12, plasma rifles have a
relatively short range--but like the pike are devastating closer in.  We
can speculate therefore that they are not employed in homogeneous
units, but in infantry units somewhat similar to those used during the
Thirty Years War (which consisted of pikemen and troops armed with
primitive muskets, each protecting the other\'s weakness).  A typical 
TL 12 infantry unit probably consists of a mix of heavy gauss rifles
(to engage the enemy at ranges beyond the effective range of plasma
rifles) and energy weapons (for devastating close in fire).  We could
also talk about support weapons (light, highly mobile cannons which
evolve into grenade and rocket launchers and mortars, etc.), but you get
the idea.

>I see these discussions as a way to bring greater depth to the game.  

   From my perspective, talking about weapons is not off topic, especially
when their real world applications are brought up.  Sure, there are
those of you who find such things boring, but not every topic posted
here appeals to everyone.

   What I especially don\'t want to see is another flame war over gun
control.  My built in flame war sensor tells me that this thread might be
leading toward that, and I don\'t think we need a repeat.

   And you realize just how powerful, and how dangerous they really
can be if you happen to be at the wrong end of one.  Guns are tools, and
while you can use them for enjoyment (i.e. target practice, hunting) they
are not toys.  When they are kept at the mythical level, it\'s too easy to
think of them as the latter.

>I vote for continued non-flame discussions of weaponry.

   I second the motion.

I find it absolutely amazing that people are griping about "gun posts" on a 
list devoted to a game written by a WARGAME DESIGNER, published by a WARGAME 
COMPANY and whose rules are at least 66% concerned with WEAPONS and COMBAT.  If 
you are personally offended by firearms, that\'s your business, but given the 
number of different people making posts about firearms, its obvious that most 
people on this list have some level of interest in the subject.

Ordinarily, I would not be some forceful, but I recently got a couple of flames 
sent to my work E-Mail for having the outrageous nerve to post about Weapons of 
Non-Leathal Intent on X-Boat.  Unfortunately, I deleted the messages out of 
annoyance before I came up with a reasonable response, but I consider those 
sorts of things (and the complaints on XBOAT and TML) to be silly at best.

At the risk of prolonging a thread that fewer and fewer people seem to
appreciate, the answer is YES... you can aim autofire weapons.  I have seen
pictures of the Douglas County Sheriff\'s Dept. in Oregon training with their
Glock 18\'s (a fully automatic version of the increasingly popular Glock 17).  On
picture shows a total of *seven* shell casings in the air while the pistol
remains more or less level (the author is shown using a two-handed stance and
the weapon does not incorporate any kind of stock).  If a machine pistol can be
kept level after firing seven rounds, I imagine that the same could be said of
today\'s SMGs and Assault Rifles.

I think I might know a little too much about guns for a Canadian!

    'body' => 'While it is true that combat is only a portion of Traveller, trying to set
the mood for the fighting is just as important as tryuing to set the mood
for the mystery.  I have always hated systems that reduced my personal
knowledge of weapons and tactics due to poor rules, or poor GMs.  If a GM
doesn\'t have a fairly good understanding of how combat works, it can spoil
the game for everyone.  A poorly run combat can spoil an adventure just as
fast as a poor plot or weak NPCs.  That is the hard part of being a GM you
have to be good at EVERYTHING.

Now perhaps this particular discussion went a little too far into the realm
of the mundane, but it does have its place.  TNE uses the same rule system
as TW2K2.2 and so a discussion of modern weaponry is appropriate.  Also so
since most of the TEDs are about TL 6-9.  My complaint with most RPG combat
is that it goes something like this.  Charaters and Enemy get into
argument/meet each other/etc.  Characters win intiative and shoot up Enemy.
Enemy shoots back, mostly missing.  Combat ends with Characers victorious
and all enemy dead unless captives are needed.

Now while this will certainly work from a cinematic standpoint, I prefer
trying to make characters take cover and treat their caracters like they
were actually there.  If someone started shooting at you what would you do?
Stand there and pull out your gun then start blasting back?  Not likely!
You will most likely dive for cover then try and figure out where the fire
is coming from then try and either suppress the enemy position or flank it.

If your players don\'t want that (my wife sure doesn\'t), then leave out some
detail.  Phoenix Command by Leading Edge Games was too far to the extreme of
deadliness and realism.  It bogged game play down considerable for most
players.  White Wolfs Storyteller System is sort of at the other end of the
spectrum.  Lets say I want to dive for cover while spraying suppresive fire
with my M-16.  First of all Even if I have a 9 die pool in firearms and a 5
die pool in dodge, I only get the 5 dice.  Then I have to split it into two
actions, say 3 dice to shoot and 2 to dodge.  It seems to work, but it
really doesn\'t.  My opponents just stand there and take 1 shot while not
dodging.  I will most likely miss, and they will most likly hit.  WW wants
to tell a story, and that is fine, but I want the skill of my character (and
my roleplaying) to determine the outcome of a fight not some strange simple
system.  The GM has to understand basic combat tactics and sprinkle just
enough in to make the game believable and fun for their players.  Set up
ambushes, use Artillery, Land Mines, and Machine Guns.  Let the enemy troops
make tactics rolls (or just use sound tactics) to suppress and out-flank the
players positions.  Have NPCs surrender or run away.  In most combats its
not a toe-to-toe slugfest until everyone is dead.  Have the enemy use cover
and movement to hide their position from the players then fire at them from
new positions to keep their heads down.  The end result will be in longer
combats both in game time and real time, but it will also convince
characters to STOP using SMG diplomacy!

Traveller came about in the 70\'s and I started playing it when I was still a
Hack & Slasher.  I used to love getting into as many fights as we could in a
game session (starship or land).  It was as I got older (and after I joined
the Army) that I realized that combat was deadly, complex, frightening, and
random.  The best skilled person wasn\'t always the winner, so you avoided it
when you could.  Combat became a last resort.  Sometimes in RPGs it is
necessary, but even then it should never be entered into lightly.  People
will DIE! Players too!  

To end this long diatribe (and don\'t take this personnaly Anders this is not
directed at you but rather at anyone who wonders why David Broussard is a
"Gun Nut")  I simply want to say that if more GMs understand how deadly
combat can be then players might be forced into less violent solutions to
most problems.  Also when the shooting does start, the players will get a
glimpse of the confusion, fear, and danger of a gunfight.

Ah! They are assuming that all such weapons are "coil guns". These
require a magentic projectile and consist of a set of coils that create
a magnetic field along the axis of the "barrel". You have the segments
in front of the projectile set to attract it, and the ones behind it
set to repel it. Basicly a linear electric motor.

Check out the design of a "rail gun" type mass driver. The projectile
is conductive. The accelerator consists of a pair of conductors running
the length of the "barrel", and a magnetic field *perpendicular* to the
rails. The current flowing thru the projectile reacts with the magnetic
field to accelerate it. 

While segmenting and switching the field could help power consumption
on a rail gun, it would *greatly* increase the complexity, and increase
the chance of failure.

The rail gun design is suited to military use *because* it is so
simple. And the fact that it doesn\'t scale up well is irrelevant for
man portable weapons. 

With "room temp" superconductors or advanced high field permanent
magnets you could have the magnetic field using *no* power. So you just
need a power supply that can throw enough current into the rails. 

The main need of a rail gun is a strong, relatively uniform magnetic
field, and a high current power supply. The velocity attained depends
on three factors:

1. magnetic field strength
2. current flow across the projectile
3. length of barrel

For a "gauss rifle" you want the barrel length to be relatively short.
And you\'ll be limited on current by the heating of the projectile and
rails. The projectile is the real limiting factor there. And there are
limits on practical magnetic field strength. 

On the other hand, we only need to reach rifle-like velocities, not the
hyper-velocities that rail guns are currently used to study. That helps
a *lot*.

Hi all. Well, I\'m finally done revamping my sector viewer,
formerly known as galactic.zip. The new version is called
gal20.zip and is currently available from the programs section of
my homepage at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/

This is a pretty hefty upgrade, so I\'ll go through a brief list
of attributes & requirements:

   *  Allows you to randomly generate sectors via both the
      traditional method and a variant method which has its roots
      in a Traveller Mailing List discussion dating back to 1993
      (included with the online help). You can also display the
      maps, of course, and it translates into English the UWP
      code of whatever world your "cursor" is on so you don\'t
      have to sit there with the book open.

   *  Keeps campaign notes in text files which can be accessed
      directly from the subsector map. The maps all mesh
      seemlessly, and access to your campaign notes is a single
      keystroke away. You can even organize your notes under a
      system of menus if you want to keep them organized.

   *  Thirteen of the Classic Traveller sectors are included
      along with a variant universe sector which I\'ve just
      started to create (the Classic sectors came from the
      Sunbane ftp archive). All the sectors come complete with
      jump routes, incidentally, and several world write-ups by
      Rob Dean are also included with the Spinward Marches
      sector.

   *  Lots of online help. You don\'t even have to know much about
      Traveller in order to use this program. Basically, it was
      designed both for long-time players as well as for people
      who are curious about the game and are thinking of "getting
      into it."

   *  Built for DOS but, of course, also runs under Windows. You
      must have at least VGA graphics capability and over two
      megs of free diskspace.

   WARNING:   You must use "-d" option when unzipping:

      >>>>>>>>    pkunzip -d gal20.zip    <<<<<<<<

   Available Now:  http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~jimv/
   (go to the programs section and look around)

Let me know if you have any trouble getting the program. I\'ll
arrange for alternate distribution methods in the next day or
two. If your access is limited to email, let me know, and I\'ll
try to arrange to postal you a disk (you will owe me a world
description or two though :-)

I\'ve recently had the opportunity to peruse a very early first draft of the
Equipment Chapter for Traveller 4 (by Greg Porter of BTRC) ... and, without
giving away any confidences whatsoever, suffice it to say that Greg has done a
superb job that takes Trav4 equipment (and tech) into the realms of Science
Fictional futures that have been undreamed of in all previous editions.

This is advanced technology that is *really* advanced ... a great deal of
thought has been put into integrating it all and extrapolating current trends
rather than simply taking outmoded tech and calling it "futuristic" as has been
the tendency in the past.

Anyhow, I think that everyone on these lists will like it when they see it. And
if the Central Supply Catalog is half as good, well, we\'re in for a real treat!

A scholarly and well-done analysis. Although I don\'t use TNE, I get both lists -
because the more generic articles are still of interest. Another thing that
would make One Clear List a good idea is the adoption of a task standardization

Trouble is with _realistic_ guns IMHO is that:
The players want them
The players do not want to be shot at by them.
If you make is *easier* to kill with a gun, then the character turnover rate
will be quicker, less chance of getting attached to the charactrs etc.

Very reasonable indeed - especially 1, 2 and 5.

So, now that everyone has had their little piece of democracy, and
exercised their right to vote (or chosen not to, as the case may be), how
do we go about implementing the unification of the lists?  Isn\'t this a
matter for the administrators of the lists to resolve?

I say we bite the bullet and just do it!  (We can have a "confirmation"
poll in 12 months or so, just in case people change their minds and want to
revert back to the way things are now.)

PS: 63 votes from about 500 eligible voters means a 12.6% voter turnout.
This is consistent with most apathetic western societies where voting is
non-compulsory, so I wouldn\'t worry about the results from a statistical
point of view - 31 is the statistically significant threshold.

What Rulesset are YOU using, Steve?

CT\'s basic Rules were about 33% Combat (20% personal combat, 10% ship) by
pagecount. I haven\'t bothered looking further than books 1-3 for this
ruleset.

MT\'s Breakdown:
        PM      30/102  Personal Combat                 Player\'s Man.
        RM      14/104  Starship Combat                 Ref\'s Man
        IE      7/97    Combat Equipment                Imp Encyclopedia
        RC      14/97   Large Scale Ground Combat       Ref\'s Companion
        RbSb    16/96   Army and Naval Strengths, and   Rebelion Sourcebook
                        an adventure that is combat oriented
        CAOCC   34/95   A-G, A-A, G-A Combat, a
                        military campaign, and guidelines
                        on aricraft and coaac warfare styles
        Total   115/591, about 20%

        BscRls  51/303  about 16%, counts only the basic set: PM, RM, and IE

TNE: Second Printing (Mk1Md1) Rulebook
        75/394pp  covers quite a bit of stuff. (most of the above topics)
        only about 19%.

I\'d say that traveller is one of the LOWER percentage-wise systems for
combat rules; most games I have seen have higher percentages. And I own
QUITE a few games (well over 1 metric ton of books for RPG\'s alone).

	If the players are intelligent, the increased turnover rate will 
only be a short-term phenominon.  Eventually, they will realize it if 
gunfights are necessary it is best to fight intelligently.  They will 
also realize that a lot of gunfights are NOT necessary.
	\'Course, if your players thrive on battle and are completely 
uninterested in the other aspects of the game, then you are correct and 
it is a bad idea to introduce realistic combat.

As someone pointed out realistic combat system (like Millenium\'s End) 
combined with guidelines to strategies and tactics is better than low 
lethal system. You can run military scenarios using realistic game system 
with even better results than with low lethal system. Of course you can\'t 
make those cinematic stunts with it. But if you want stand and fight

	Actually that\'s only true for the first couple of 
characters...after that the players figure out that guns are 
dangerous things, and should be a last resort, not first.  Of course, 
as GM in such a game, you have to remember that as well.  You can\'t 
just throw NPC\'s in the mold of spaghetti western bad guys at the 
party.

	Either a game is cinematic or realistic...as long as both sides of 
the equation play by the same rules (GM and players) everythng works 
out ok, it\'s just that different styles of play are enforced.

He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.

In another RPG I enjoy, Call of Cthulhu, there\'s an informal maxim that if
you\'re shooting at the enemy, you\'re probably already doomed. 

In my view, having the PCs afraid of being shot at is a Good Thing.  Far 
too many campaigns have the PCs reaching for their guns as the first 
approach to solving a problem, while more realistically this will be (for 
rational characters) the last resort, given how likely *they* are to get 
killed once the bullets are flying.

Realistic guns on both sides, PC and NPC, force players to do two things:

(1) Avoid combat whenever possible.
(2) When combat becomes inevitable, give consideration to tactics (cover,
    surprise, positional advantages) which will let them give better than
    they get.

To my way of thinking, getting players to approach combat in this way is 
highly desirable.  Of course, if you\'re running a space-opera style 
campaign, your considerations will be entirely different.  My favorite 
example of the latter style comes in "Return of the Jedi", during the 
battle outside the Imperial station on Endor.  Guys in bulky white combat 
armor die by the score with every from-the-hip shot by a rebel -- then 
when Leia gets hit by a Trooper, she grabs her shoulder and pouts a 
little.  Her dress must be made of that new combat-armor-grade silk...

I\'m not so sure about "simple technology" being the way of the future\'s military
forces.  Even today we rely almost too much on technology to fight our battles
(ie: night vision, smart bombs, stealth technology, Global Positioning
Satellites, etc.).  It might be more accurate to say that field repairs will not
resort to actual the *repair* of such systems but the *replacement* of specific
component systems.  Today\'s automotive field certainly reflects this (Ford just
released a non-servicable transmission).  And if you are paying any attention to
the Battle Dress threads, our future in military technology is only going to get
more complicated (as will are dependence on said technology).

This is true to a point.  The kinetic energy available to such a projectile at
the muzzle of the weapon can never be greater that the energy put into the
weapon in the first place or we\'ll have perpetual energy machines all over the
place  8^)

1.) About discussion of weapons: I think it would be much more interesting
    to hear about the muzzle velocity, ROF and weight of the weapons, than
    to hear the oppinions of people that heard oppinions of other people
    about that weapon (sorry)
2.) About aiming with automatic fire. It is logical, that the first round
    in an autofire burst can be aimed as good as a single shot, with the
    other rounds being bonus. I usually say the first round is fired as
    if it was fired as a normal semi automatic shot, for the second one
    the recoil for autofire is used to determine hit chance, and for the
    others the difficulty increases by one level for each round until
    "Impossible" is reached. Also if someone lays fire on the same area
    for a full turn, this counts as a turn of aiming and difficulty is
    changed to "Formidable". (I also use tables to determine the number
    of hits, because I was bored by that huge ammount of die rolling.
    If someone is interested, I\'ve made one up for 3,5 and 10 round bursts.
    Just roll one die for every burst. It produces (almost, within 5%)
    the same results as the original rules.)
3.) About deadliness. I think TNE has one of the deadliest and most
    unpredictable combat systems. I just remember a STR A, CON 8 PC dying
    after that little pistol(Damage 1) hit him in the Torso. He did not
    wore any body armor because he said "I don\'t need body armor, I am
    tough !". For all Gamemasters that want deadly combat, never forget
    the Quick Kill rule! Even if only the double damage rule is used,
    a Damage 1 hit in the head can cause a PC with CON 10 to be knocked
    unconcious (Outstanding success, damage 2, 10% chance for quick kill,
    if successful 4 dice of damage, average 14, min 4, max 24. Unlikely
    but possible)

You use d6\'s for your weapons?
Thats why they\'re unrealistic, try d10\'s.

Another thing.
Is there anywhere rules for designing aqua-space craft.
These would be stressed to withstand high undersea pressures and vacuum of space
They would have to have underwater propulsion systems as part of the ship.
Reason why not:
Terrans have a lot of land, therefore the writers do not deem underwater
propulsion as a viable part of a space ship, but think about it.
The advantages of a dual sub/space ship are endless.
You do not need to \'take off\' from the area of your base.
Fuel is all around you.
Most will possibly be armed with torpedoes (underwater), laser/ missile turrets
(for space) and meson cannon (for both).

Are there any other considerations to take care of?
The possibilities of ice freezing over a streamlined/ Airframe ship would have
to be taken care of.
IMHO a aqua ship would be an ideal system patrol boat.
It can easily hide.
The base can be easily hidden.
It will be able to be refuled.
Armed with a meson gun, it can fire undetected from mid ocean, and move away.
Placed on a planet with a low TL (post collapse) with tribes, on scattered
islands, such an operation would easily avoid detection.

The ship would have to be laid out differently.
Go on! Design me a ship (max 350 tonnes).

:)

One other application.
Fighters could possibly also be made to be aqua-fighters, though the ice
build up would severely create a problem here.

Is this a possible option?

   Standard streamlined spacecraft with Thruster Plates will do quite nicely.

  This is an old CT tactic.

Ice buildup?  Why operate out the North Atlantic when you can operate in the
deep waters near Hawaii?  :-)

Heh.  Why not d20s (since they\'re already on the table for to-hit anyway)?  Let\'s make it really realistic...

BTW, has anyone else experienced confusion about the variable settings for chemical cartridge
lasers?  I had a PC literally flame an entire NPC platoon with about half a magazine from a CLC rifle.  
Of course, he was a little lucky with the autofire rolls, but...  I need to rethink the way it works.  The
lethality was high because the targets were unarmored, and now the whole team wants to carry
nothing else...  (This could go badly for the players when I insert armored foes...  *evil cackle*)

Ummm...  I was under the impression that streamlined starships were by definition undersea
beasties, capable of refueling while submerged, etc.  Would the structural elements really be that
different?  Especially when the bulkheads of an "armored" starship are designed to take re-entry,
combat damage, etc.?

De-icing is a thought...  But if we\'re using contra-grav, what difference does our "real" aerodynamic
profile make?  (I feel an eerie deja-vu that we\'re about to re-enter the flamewar over C-G again...  Duck!)

I vaguely remember some CT stuff that had SDBs which used similar tactics...  But for RC operations,
it sounds even better...  Reminds me of all those old Star Blazers, Voltron, and company cartoons...  Does
anybody still air them?

Due to smaller size maybe, but the thrust-to-weight for fighters is usually higher, so why
would ice be a problem for a spaceship?
 
> Is this a possible option?

Sure!  I even think I\'ll steal the undersea theme!!!

>From what I remember of the \'off-the-shelf\' ships from the TNE
rulebook, the main problem with the ships being submersible, assuming
the hull will hold, and HEPLAR works underwater or another propulsion
system is used, is to get it to sink in the first place.  Even the
densest of ships appear to have a loaded mass of approximatly half the
ammount of water they\'d displace...

Anyone got any stats on how much volume compressors and tankage takes
up on a modern submarine, and how much buoyancy can be negated?

A full load of HG HCD costs 26cr.

Standard Equipment:
  Looking Glass Option
  Environmental Controls
  30km Radio
  50m NAS
  1 x Searchlight, Range 250m
  WSV (Wide Spectrum Visual) Goggles, Range 300m
Power Production:
  Fuel Cell 0.013 MW/hour.  As listed the suit requires .0118MW, which 
         leaves .0012 MW/hour for extra equipment.
  Fuel .026kl, 10 hours endurance.

The suit as listed only weighs .1917 tons, which leaves 183kg for extra 
equipment. It also has a .0012 MW/hour power surplus. Scouts often use  
this to carry extra sensor equipment, biological & geological samples,
oxygen tanks or random tools.  

         The Scout walkabout suit is designed to provide a mobile environment 
for IISS personal exploring new and possibly dangerous worlds.  The same 
strength enhancing powered exoskeleton used in Imperial BattleDress allows 
the user to carry a great deal of equipment.  
        The armor features looking glass capabilites to allow the user to
observe native life forms without disturbing them.  The armor has many 
power outlets to feed power to different carried devices.  It also has
hooks so the Scout can attach and carry the devices.  

The suit was based on a design in Megatraveller Journal  #1

    'body' => 'MPG-Net is moving several components from the New York office to the Key
West office.  Part of this involves moving ftp.mpgn.com, which also
processes the mailing list.

The physical move of this machine is still a couple of weeks off, but to
prepare for it, we are moving the mailing list to a machine in Key West much
sooner, like tomorrow (5/8).  This is in conjuction with changing from
Listproc to Majordomo as well.  This will hopefully solve some of the
reoccuring problems like having everyone on the list postponed, or people
being removed every Friday because of a bounce.

Here is what is going to happen.  Tomorrow morning, we will shut listproc
down for a couple of hours and move the subscriber database, converting it
to a majordomo format.  The aliases will be adjusted so that mail to:
traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com will go to the majordomo version.  At
that point we will be up on majordomo.  We will restart listproc, and let
the partial digest expire and be sent out.  So you may get two partial
digests tomorrow or Thursday.

Posting messages will not change.  You will continue to post to
traveller@mpgn.com and xboat@mpgn.com.  What will change is administrative
options.  If you are digest and want to go to instant, you send a subscribe
message to traveller-request@mpgn.com, and send a unsubscribe request to
traveller-digest-request@mpgn.com.

Digests will have a slightly different format, and will have a different
file name in the archive . . . Which brings up the archive:  Since
ftp.mpgn.com is a couple of weeks from being here, we will go ahead and
archive the messages.  You  can do a majordomo get to retrive them.  When
ftp.mpgn.com arrives, we will load the digests to that machine and away we go.

With any luck, this should be fairly seemless to you and things should run a
bit smoother.

	Hi all.  Following the results of the survey on the future of
TML/XTML, several people have called for the unification of all lists into
one.  This was the option that clearly won in the survey (somewhat to my
disappointment, but hey that\'s the democratic process...) and people seem
to want to get this going now. When I started the survey, my idea was that
this was simply an opinion poll.  I was not thinking that the results
would be implemented right away.  I would like to wait for NT to come out,
and run another poll at that time to confirm opinions.  Following this, we
could change/combine the lists. I\'m pretty sure Rob Miracle is not going 
to change anything before then in any case.
	While I\'m on the topic, I would like to re-iterate my strong 
support for some system of rules to be implemented if we have one big 
list.  I\'m not expecting Rob Miracle to censor the list or anything.  The 
rules would be informally enforced.  Whenever anyone signed up to the 
list, they\'d get a note outlining the "netiquette" of the TML/XTML.  
Offenders would simply recieve notes from list members reminding them of 
the guidelines (I would do it, and others who get peaved by this sort of 
thing would probably do so as well.).  Repeat offenders might be dealt 
with more harshly, especially if they engaged in frequent flamewars.  
Here again is the list of rules I would recommend.  Anyone want to add 
to/subtract from/modify this?

>1. All messages would be clearly labelled as to which game versions they
>applied to.  A prefix system might be one way to do it:  CT/MT, TNE, NT, or

Ciao for now,
Charles.
	
PS. I think newbies to the list should recieve the URL for the mailing
list FAQ if they don\'t already, and also a URL for some sort of "History
of Traveller Game Versions" (I know there\'s at least one out there, 
though I can\'t remember where).

        Because if you restrict where you operate, you make yourself easier
to find and target?

        Some more comments on quotes. Not necessarily rules, just highly
encouraged reminders. In addition to limiting the number of generations of
quotes in a single message:

        *Don\'t* quote an entire 150 line message. Period. Excerpt enough of
the parts to which you\'re replying to clearly identify them, and that\'s it.
We all got the original message the first time, or we can get it if we want it.

        *Don\'t* quote the original author\'s 12 line signature and/or witty
comments. His/her name\'s enough.

        *Don\'t* quote a message just to say "me too"

        Also, in addition to the Web version of the FAQ, maybe we could have
a monthly posting of a shortened FAQ, referring to the Web version _and_
reiterating the commonly-accepted norms (call them rules if you wish) for
participation in the list.

    'body' => 'Some formulas for use when making better gundesign rules than FF&S
especially concerning penetration. Pen rules in FF&S is a joke IMHO.
The formulas below should not necessary be used as other factors such as
ground plane reflection for explosives and relative hardness of projectile
and armor for low velocity rounds change the rules a bit.

Formula for pressure from explosion:

p = k * ((E^2)^(1/3))/(r^2)

p: pressure from explosive
k: a constant that has to be determined by you
E: Energy of explosive, could be TNT-equivs, Mega Joules etc
r: Distance from center of explosion

This formula assumes air as medium of propagation and that the charge is
hanging in midair ie no reflections from the groundplane. The hot fumes
produced by the explosive itself decreases exponentially and might be the
reason why almost all "serious" rpg have blast effects decreasing
exponentially.

b = k1 * e^(-k2 * r)
b: Blast effect, mainly the temperature of the gasses.
k1: A constant
k2: Also a constant.

Formula for penetration of KE projectile including bullets:

d = (m^(1/2) * v/(k * c^(0.75)))^(0.7)

d: Penetration in dm (1 dm = 0.1 m)
m: Mass of projectile in kg
c: Caliber of projectile in dm
v: Velocity of projectile at impact in m/s, not necessarily the same as muzzle v
k: An empirical factor measured to k=2000 - 2500 for solid armor piercing
rounds and k=1400 - 1800 for hard core projectiles.

I myself use the formula
d = k * m * v / (c^2)
With the same types of units as above but another k of course.

The above formulaes excpet the last one are derived from:
Rheinmetall Handbook on Weaponry, a 750 page book on gundesign, testing and
evaluation.

Funny, one of my players asked me this last night, but we play using HEPlaR.
How would this type of engine do underwater, can they be used to create propultion
under water?

I figure that an output that creates a pressure higher thab the waterpressure would
at least keep water out. I guess that propultion would woork also but would that 
leave a rather distinct heattrack from the vaporized water.

Any comments ?

Ice buildup? Water gets most dense at +4 degrees centrigrade so if your
oceans aren\'t deepfrozen no ice will form on the SDB/sub unless you surface
often.
If you surface often in a warsituation the ice will be melted off by your
enemys lasers as they vaporize you :)

Thats what happens when you go off to aberdeen. You don\'t get to hear that
our group already does that, or did. I got the idea from this list.

Now i use another system. To make things a little more worrying, i do not
use the hit location chart anymore with the exception of being hit by
autofire and with precise aiming into various body locations. Generally (
and i think this is true in real life, tell me otherwise if i am wrong) a
person shooting at another will tend to instinctively shoot at the chest
and abdomen as it is presents the largest target with a higher probability
of hits, with greater chance of incapacitating or killing. Professional
users of firearms are tought to \'double tap\' targets in the chest for good
reason.

Thus in Traveller (and i am talking TNE) most combats tend to involve a lot
of chest damage. I\'ve found my players starting to worry about the damage
they are receiving now its hits almost entirely to the body area.


>Is there anywhere rules for designing aqua-space craft.

I believe that traveller space craft are capable of operating in water to
some extent. Underwater SDB bases for instance, and most atmosphere capable
ships can certainly land in water (see one of the MT book covers...can\'t
remember which one it was) which aids ocean refuelling when land masses are
scarce.

I do not know how well HEPLAR (TNE) drives will function under water, but
i\'m sure MT thruster plates would perform adequately.

To arm a star ship with torpedos would be silly IMHO. A starship has a
primary role for interplanetary or interstellar operations. The torpedos
would be wasteful on internal volume. Better to fit more useful equipment.
Fitting of torpedo\'s, a fairly antiquated technology at TL-10+ is best
assigned to purpose built submersibles. Submarines would make useful
planetary defense role is carrying a meson weapon or PDM\'s.



>The ship would have to be laid out differently.
>Go on! Design me a ship (max 350 tonnes).

Erm... see the Shukugan (Dragon) class SDB in Brilliant Lances but thats
400 tons i\'m afraid.

Interesting idea, Tim. 

This works because agent-types are trained to think a lot like cops do.

I\'d suggest, however, that the MI characters recieve a new skill (or an old
one, depending upon how plugged into old Paranioa Press supps you are). The
skill is Intelligence Analysis (specialty: Military), which I define as the
ability to analyze data with an eye to MI value. IA(Mil) is the military
equivalent of Criminolgy (the ability to analyze crime scenes for pertinent
data).

Generic Intelligence Analysis skill might also be available to pure Agents.


The promotion scheme should work; that  I have _no_ problem with. Further,
the Retention roll should use the service table vice the Agents table.

        I have not received my T4 copy, so all I know of the new version has
been learned in the TML. Forgive me if I am way off base, but I really do
not know if the "moved stars" stuff refers to a dramatical change or
something minor. Is it possible that the way of dividing space into
subsectors at Milieu 0 was different, so the whole map is displaced, or the
changes in T4 are of relative position between specific stars?

All the way from orbit? You\'re going to have to enter atmosphere *sometime,
and unless you spend an awful lot of time braking before then, you\'ll have a
lot of velocity still built up when you hit air. Also, when leaving, it
helps to have wings and airframe to generate lift to help you out of atmosphere.

I always kept the assumption that the thruster plates put out enough heat
that it was unhealthy to be too close to the landing spot. OK, battle-dress
Marines could manage it, but anyone with less protection better dig a big
damned hole!

<grin> It doesn\'t stop it... it just keeps it from *accelerating*. And if
you\'re getting whomped on so badly that you\'ve lost internal gravity, you\'re
in deep kimchee anyway, and should probably be considering surrender at that
point anyway.

Anyway, how *likely* is it that a ship will get hit badly enough to take out
the internal gravity, and still have a functioning power plant *and*
maneuver drive? I don\'t remember anything like that in any starship combat
table, although I stopped with MT/High Guard, so if it *does* come up in FFS
or something, well, never mind.  :)

Couldn\'t you also build a safety interlock that prevented a hit from taking
out the grav all over the ship? "Redundant controls", or something like that?

Every 10 meters? Good God, Leonard, you must be part owner of a hatch and
iris valve manufacturing company!!   :)

Seriously, though... yes, compartmentalization is a Good Thing. Especially
for warships, but *some* degree is necessary for all ships, unless you\'re
criminally stupid. Still, in everyday operations, the horizontal layout
seems more efficient. I\'m minded of a mortgage company I used to work for,
that had their own building, and different functions spread over all eight
floors. We spent as much time waiting for elevators as we did doing anything
else that might have required going to see anyone else.

    Kangaroos are already upright, and already have manipulative members.
Seems like this would be a much better head-start than any extra "social

    Um, if we were talking about a corporation or an enterprise then this would
be applicable. However we are talking about one, or a very small collection,
of individuals. For someone who thinks it is fun to move planets around the
place, pinch off pocket universes, etc, etc, I\'m willing to grant the 
possibility
that they might uplift a parmecium because they thought it was neat.

  However, in the end, the facts of the matter are quite simple. The ancients 
chose
dogs for uplifting because _Marc Miller_ thought it was neat.

        I think simians could count as a single species if you want room for
more. Sea lions and the like should be included, both for the potential
intelligence (number of brain circunvolutions and proportion brain/body) and
for their utility (planets with useful oceans)

        Yes, precisely the system where Sternmetal experimented with the

on a whale... curious.

        The Ancients did that and the result was the Vargr, so probably the

        Although based on *big* cats with noticeable brains... I suggest

        At least one of the species should be capable of flying, because of
the utility criterion. Since there are not living flying creatures on Earth
with *big* brains, probably the Solomani would pick some from another
planet. A dinosaur-like flying critter would be a wonderful scout.

Actually, the way gravity works (in terms of things like potential
energy, which we *do* understand) it\'d be *much* easier to only
increase the gravity "locally" because the energy needed depends on the
mass involved. So the more mass you want to affect, the more power it
takes.

There are two problems. First, you need a *deep* enough atmosphere to
supply the pressure you need. And nothing but depth will do it. So you
need enough gas for the total "column" of gas above a given point to
weigh 15 pounds per square inch. We can ignore the pressure gradient,
and just figure that based on air at normal pressure.

15 pounds = 6.804 kg 
1 sq in = 6.5416 cm^2
gives us 1.040 kg/cm^2. 

Which means you need a kilo of air for every sq cm of surface on the planetoid.

1000 cc = 1 liter. A liter of air weighs about a gram. So
1040*1000=10,400 meters. In other words, not allowing for pressure
differences, the atmosphere is 10.4 km deep. It\'ll actually be
noticeable at 100 km, as we all know.

Sure. If you\'ve got a powerplant the size of a small moon. Conservation
of energy says that no matter *how* you do it, you have to pay for it.
A good set of equations for this are the following:

F=ma  force = mass times acceleration
W=Fd  work (energy) = force times distance.

These give:

W=mad  Work = mass times acceleration times distance.

In other words the energy required is the poduct of the mass,
acceleration, and the distance for which the acceleration is applied.

For a 1 km cube of rock (assume the rock is 4 times as dense as water)
you get a mass of 4 trillion kg (4e12). So to accelerate it at 1 meter
per second per second thru a distance of one meter takes 4 million MJ. 
And each additional meter of movement takes another 4 million MJ.

Nope. Think about it. What are they going to push (or pull)? Also, the
energy costs are prohibitive. Venus is essentially non-rotating. To
spin it up to a 24 hr means speeding up a mass on the equator from
essentially zero to 1000 miles an hour. Call it 400 meters per second.
So for a 1 kilo mass of rock at the equator, it takes .5*1*400^2 or .08
MJ to speed it up. How many kilos of rock at the equator? And the rock
farther away from the equator or closer to the center of the planet
don\'t have to move as fast, but they still have to be sped up some. 
Again, you need unreasonable amounts of energy.

I\'d say that it\'s confined to an area "between" plates. And as a
"cheat" calculation, use the something like W=Mad formula from above.
So the energy required would be determined by the acceleration (one g
is 9.8 m/s^2) the distance between the plates, and the *mass* between
the plates. We need some sort of "area" term otherwise you get the
silly answer that it takes different amounts of energy for the same
ship depending on the *direction*. I\'ll have to try coming up with
appropriate doubketalk later.

The one "good" thing about this sort of thing is that it should require
*energy*, not *power*. In other words, once the field strength has
built up, you only have to pump in enough energy to make up for losses
in the field generators.

Nope, E=mc^2 is not the appropriate formula. Instead, the correct one
is to figure the potential energy of the gravity field. In essence, the
energy required to "de-gravitate" an object in a given gravity field is
the same amount that is required to boost it to escape velocity!

Still a large number, but more workable.

The bit with "paired plates" for a "contained" zero-g area would likely
be that you have to put that much energy into the "floor" plate, but
you get it back from the "ceiling" plate. Minus losses.

Actually, other than the forces generated in the process of "turning"
the ship, the vector will be the same at all times. Because the main
drive only pushes in one direction. The "steering jets" or attitude
thrusters, or whatever aren\'t anywhere *near* as powerful.

Also you don\'t "bank" to make turns in space. The movies and TV are
almost uniformly wrong about that. Instead, when you are making a turn,
during the "turn", your main drive is pointing directly *away* from the
center of the "curve".

If you were going "north" (coasting) and wanted to change to going due
"west" at the same speed, you\'d point the nose of the ship southwest,
and fire the engines until you were moving east. Vector addition is
funny stuff.

Nope. With no gravity, the *only* forces you feel are due to your
engines. So you turn the ship, then fire the main engines. That changes
your course. But except for some "minor" centrifuge effects as you turn
the ship (while still proceeding in the same direction), what you will
feel will *always* be "being pushed back in your seat".

Direction of travel and orientation of ship are not linked. You
direction of travel is the sum of all the different vectors your main
drive has given the ship. And every single time you use it, from the
inside what you feel is "down is towards the engines".

The sideways force you feel when making a turn in a car is because the
wheels on the road are exerting a force *towards* the center of the
curve, thus making "down" feel like the direction towards the outside
of the curve. With an airplane, it\'s wings biting into the air that
generate the "g forces", again, with "down" being towards the "outside"
of the curve.

With a ship in space, the only way to generate those forces is to turn
the ship so the main drive points towards what will be the outside of
the curve (and the nose points towards the inside). So you will
*always* feel the main drive along the same axis.

> As

Nope, because to *make* the turn, you have to (slowly) rotate the ship
until *then* fire the engines. With the result that the rotation has
aligned the floors with the new "down".

For various engineering reasons, you won\'t be rotating the ship fast
enough to create more as much as one g of centrifugal force.

As has been pointed out on the list, you can\'t target *parts* of the
ship at typical combat ranges. By the time the shot (even a laser) gets
there, the ship\'s position and orientation will have changed, probably
by 100s of meters. You aren\'t firing at the ship. You are firing at
spots where you hope it will be.

Remember, one *hex* in space combat is 2.3 times as wide as *Earth*.

The answer is "yes but..."

Yes, there was a Theta Borealis sector published. But like all the
other "non-canon" sectors that got abandoned when MT came out, the star
info in the alien sourcebooks and the Atlas of the Imperium is *different*.

So even if you had a copy of the Theta Borealis sector that Group One
published, the star positions won\'t match what you have. The same is
true of just about *all* the non-GDW, non-DGP sectors published in the
old days. The maps in Atlas of the Imperium, and the various Alien
supplements is different.

So go for it.

You need a fair amount of streamlining because you are moving rather

Except that being "non-airframe" your ship wouldn\'t be able to handle
things like wind gusts, much less jetstreams, clear air turbulence, and
all the other fun things that can swat even experienced pilots out of
the sky.

From: Milan Merhar <m.merhar@ieee.org>

Copied verbatim from the newspaper:

Dr. Eugene Podkletnov, a researcher at the Tampere University
of Technology, Finland, reported that during a superconductivity
experiment, tests showed a small drop in the weight of objects placed
over a device made up of a rotating superconducting ceramic disk suspended
by three electric coils enclosed in a cryostat.

The latest experiments by the Finnish researchers have reportedly registered
a two percent drop in the weight of objects suspended over the cryostat.
Controversy over this report has been fueled by Podkletnov\'s decision to
withdraw a paper he had submitted to the Journal of Physics-D: Applied
Physics, possibly due to patents being filed for the privately-funded research.

NASA has already contributed $150,000 to Dr. Ning Li, a research scientist
at the University of Alabama Huntsville Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic
Research to duplicate the tests. Li published a 1991 paper in Physical
Review-D on gravity-modification experiments based on the interaction
between rotating
superconductors and the local gravity field. Her theories postulate that the
lattice-ion structure in a superconductor plays a significant part in
superconduction. Rotation of the lattice ions caused by the EM field generates
a gravito-magnetic force which can affect the local gravity field.

Yes, but the wide variety of roos you describe are all different species.
Domestic dogs hae everything from chihuahuas to Irish wolf hounds in the 
*same* species, all capable of interbreeding. (Though I admit I have never
seen a St. Bernard-Pekinese  cross.  I have often longed to.  It would 
probably require the St .Bernard be the mother and training the father 
to use a ladder...)  Even the different "species" of dog, wolf, and 
coyote prove quite interfertile.

    "Larger kangaroos are also fairly intelligent - maybe not as 
     intelligent as a dog or an ape, but certainly highly social and with 
     rudimentary vocal communication. Measuring animal intelligence is 
     bloody difficult anyway, since any measurement is going to be biased 
     by our human-centric view of things."

But if we\'re uplifting something, we\'re probably deliberately aiming at 
a more humanlike intellect, not a completely-unhuman-but-just-as-good 
intellect, not only for reasons of self-interest but exactly for the 
reasons of difficulty you mention.  If dogs have a more humanlike 
psychology (not that I know they do), that would be a mark in their 
favor.

But I don\'t see that these species need by in competition for uplift.

Actually, no.  When you maneuver in space, the thrust is mainly along the
axis of the maneuver drive.  Spinning the ship will produce centripetal
accelerations, but these will not be as significant.  Remember, Traveller
uses a realistic vector movement system - not WWII dogfights in space.

Now in atmospheres, such as a gas giant, you will get other forces (from the
atmosphere interacting with the hull) so I would expect SDB\'s to be planned
with this is mind.

I would expect a big factor for merchants (who don\'t expect to be in combat)
would be convenience and cost on the ground.  Having a horizontal layout

   Elephants have already been done.  Not to full human/Vargr level
intelligence, but enough for limited language.  This is out of an 
old JTAS.  The trunk had been modified with finger like tentacles at the 
end.  Hmmm... I wonder if that issue came out before or after "Footfall"?
Probably before.

   Raccoons are a good subject.  Bruce Sterling did a short story that
mentioned genetically enhanced Raccoons.

  As mentioned elsewhere, big cats (cougar, leopard, tiger) are good
subjects.  I wouldn\'t be suprised if the Solmani had developed such
at some point.  If you are in the New Era, that data, along with
genetic samples (perhaps even grown samples in statis) could just
be waiting in a forgotten lab...

Meaning that the ship is so flimsy that the wind would rip it apart?
I would think that a space ship would be built relatively sturdily
to take acceleration (which is not always in one direction), small
meteor impacts, etc...  At least sturdy enough that a stiff wind won\'t
rip parts of it off.  Also, if you have contragravity, how would you
fall?  You don\'t weight anything.  If nothing else, a planetoid could
come in this way... it may not be able to land, though there\'s no
inherent reason why it couldn\'t have landing gear.  I agree that an
unstreamlined ship wouldn\'t be able to fly very fast or maneuver
very well at all, but it just seems silly to say that it can not
enter the atmosphere...

I would say that these lateral forces wouldn\'t necessarily be minor
in a warship.  It\'d be spinning pretty fast and in a ship that was
long, those in the nose or tail would be flung sideways pretty
hard.  You might even want to mount more than one \'main\' engine to

Well, technically the force you feel is your inertia trying to make
you keep going straight while the car is changing direction.  The car
then exerts a force on you to turn you along with it.

Why not?  I\'d assume that ships in space combat are constantly and
quickly rotating to bring various weapons and drives to bear.  Seems
like you\'d want to design your ship to rotate as fast as possible.
The closer you get, the faster you\'re going to be changing orientation.
You might not generate a g of \'centrifugal force\', but you will be
slamming people into bulkheads as the ship suddenly starts rotating.
You\'re going to need to coordinate maneuvers with damage control
and not do much maneuvering when folks are out fixing stuff.

        True. And the device is basically very simple.

        However, the leader of Department of Electrical Engineering in

In mail you write:


Direction of travel and orientation of ship are not linked. You
direction of travel is the sum of all the different vectors your main
drive has given the ship. And every single time you use it, from the
inside what you feel is "down is towards the engines".

With a ship in space, the only way to generate those forces is to 
turn
the ship so the main drive points towards what will be the outside of
the curve (and the nose points towards the inside). So you will
*always* feel the main drive along the same axis.

Nope, because to *make* the turn, you have to (slowly) rotate the 
ship
until *then* fire the engines. With the result that the rotation has
aligned the floors with the new "down".

For various engineering reasons, you won\'t be rotating the ship fast
enough to create more as much as one g of centrifugal force.

Even if its only a g, that\'s enuff to send someone flying who\'s

turns, they slowly rotate.  In combat I don\'t think there\'s any slow 
rotation involved.  They would be firing the manuevering engines as 
hard as possible.  Plus vectoring is fine using todays spacecraft that 
have manuevering jets on front.  In Traveller, you have manuever 
drive.  Are there jets still?  Looking at all the deckplans, the 
manuever drive is back with jump drive and power plant.  Would this 
change navigation?

Don\'t you mean "meter of acceleration."  I hate to quibble, but I\'m not great
at this stuff on my own, and I need to make sure I understand it correctly.
 Once the planetoid is moving, it should continue to move at a velocity of
one meter per second, but will only accelerate at a rate of one meter per
second per second if you continue to add thrust.  Right?

Absolutely.  I don\'t think it should be easier to stay in Intel than it is to
remain in the service proper, as would be the case for Army Intel officers. I
forgot to add this line before:  "You should roll for continuance on the
appropriate military career chart.  If you fail the roll, you are discharged,
and begin the Mustering out process."  Perhaps the character could then apply
for an agent career in some government agency, without the -1 DM required for
a second career, because of their military intel experience.  BTW, I assume
that you cannot transfer back from Intel to an ordinary unit. (Once a spy...)
 If anyone knows how this is handled in modern military forces, I would
appreciate your input.

Andrew Boulton asked:

 "Where did that last bit come from?"

I believe I read it in an essay by Niven entitled "Down in Flames," in 
which he described how he had mined out the Known Space setting and 
was going to move on.  (Apparently he changed his mind.)

One of the things he said was that the kzinti are the tnuctipun, but 
the only person in Known Space who could know that was Larry Greenberg,
the telepathic hero of "World of Ptaavs."  Having read the mind of a 
thrint/Slaver, Greenberg knows what a tnuctip looks like.  Of course, 
Greenberg has never seen a kzinti, because he shipped out on the 
Lazy Eight II, before we ever encountered the kzinit.  That ship was a 
near-c slowboat and failed to decelerate.  It is coasting through the 
galaxy at near-c speeds.  Should anyone ever rescue the crew of the 
Lazy Eight II, though, Greenberg might, as Niven put it, be walking 
the streets of Jinx, say, see a kzinti visitor, and exclain, "Heavens
preserve us! A tnuctip!"  No one, including the kzinti, would know what
he was talking about at first.

Perhaps this was a notion Niven was just playing with, so we should 
not count it as canonical for Known Space.

	I don\'t know...I just thought that the knee-jerk reaction to physics
news from BYU would be to dismiss it as those wacky mormons.

I\'ll take a shot, with the likelihood of correction by those on this list
who have been military personnel in the various navies and other services
rep[resented here.

My own take; Rank of the commander is a function of the size of the
vessel.  The larger the vessel, the higher the rank of the commander.

All Jump capable vessels, no matter how small, will be commanded by an
officer.  Ship\'s boats and smaller SBDs may be commanded by a Chief Petty
Officer (CPO), or an Ensign.

Here is a table of O ranks (from memory);

Ensign
Lieutenant (j.g.)
Lieutenant
Lt. Commander
Commander
Captain
Commodore (see below)

Flag Ranks;
Rear Admiral
Vice Admiral
Admiral
Admiral of the Fleet

An Ensign would never (almost) command more than a ship\'s boat or lander.
This is due to the simple fact that an Ensign is still "in training" and
requires some sort of supervision before being trusted with an independant
command.  More often an ensign will be in charge of a section or
department on a larger ship (laundry officer, helm station occupant,
signals or communication officer) while they train for the lieutenant\'s
exam.

That they put Ensign Kim in charge on the Voyager in a recent episode
seems to me a sign of desperation.  They probably should have left someone
else to be in command.

A Lieutenant Junior Grade may command a small ship, usually insystem,
often a 300-400 ton SDB, occassionally a 400 ton Close Escort or Courier,
but only when a more senior officer is unavailable.  Lt. j.g. is more
likely to command a section or in fact, like the ensigns, not be in charge
of anyone, but be a bridge officer.

A lieutenant is the most likely rank to be in charge of the above
mentioned 400 ton Close Escort.  This is a legitimate command officer
(though the lowest ranking one).  In part this is due to the need for
about 4 officers on a Close Escort.  To me that would be one Lt
(commanding), One Lt(jg) or Ensign (1st Officer/Helm), One Ensign or Lt
(jg) as medical Officer, and a CPO as Chief Engineer (a "non-commissioned
Officer" usually more experianced than the commander).  A Lt would not be
allowed to cammand anything much over 1000 tons, so larger escorts are
permitted.  

A Lt. Commander may command vessels from the Close Escort (where she or he
may be a commander of a small [2-5 ships] squadron) up to the lighter
destroyers, say 2000 tons.  

Commanders are almost interchangable with Lt. Commanders, but will almost
never be in charge of an escort under 1000 tons, and might be seen
commanding the biggest destroyers (5000 tons?).  Also a commander is about
the lightest rank to command any kind of base or installation (obviously
the smallest ones).

Captains, ah to be of Flag Rank in Cleon I\'s Navy.  The full spectrum of
Captains are the mainstay of the command officers in the Navy. They will
command (in order of seniority) all vessels up to the largest and down to
the smallest of insdependent size (even an occassional 5k ton destroyer).
Captains (and all other ranks for that matter) are on "The List" which
shows every captain in order of seniority.  Captains may be passed over
for command when there is a command open, but generally the list is stuck
to so that as new commands open up (due to new construction, promotion of
retirement of the commander of a vessel, etc) the senior unposted Captain
on the list is offered that position.  A Captain will generally be offered
a command proportional to her or his seniority. 

All ships are commanded by Captains.  More senior officers are commanders
of squadrons, fleets or armadas of ships, not individual vessels (they
instruct the commanders under their orders, but do not interfere in the
running of the ship itself).  Even the largest Dreadnought is commanded by
a Captain (albiet a senior one) although there will often (almost always?)
be an admiral of one type or another along to command the Batron.

Commodores are a special case.  Historically, Commodore was a rank between
Captain and Admiral.  More recently a Commodore is a title given to an
officer of Captain\'s rank who is acting as overall commander of a squadron
of ships.  The latter meaning is the one I recommend.  So a senior captain
will be appointed Commodore of a squadron of destroyers up to  Battleships
(up to 100k tons each) or a mixed task force of relatively small size for
a specific mission or period of time.

Admirals are awarded the command of Permanents formations of ships and of
areas of responsibility.  I would use a Rear Admiral to command a system
of moderate importance, a Vice Admiral for a system with its own
detachment, and a full admiral for subsector capitals and Naval Bases.
Each Dreadnought BatRon and regular Battleship BatRon will have an admiral
(probably full) in overall command, with vice and rear admirals in charge
of the Crusier section, destroyer section, scout section, carrier section,
etc.  Perhaps even one in charge of all Fighter Ops.

More senior admirals would command entire subsectors (as opposed to the
Capital itself) in a way which closely mirrors the Feudal pattern of
nobles, only in a more organized fashion.  Areas of more importance or
activity would have a denser concentration of Flag Rank officers, Other
areas lesser.  For example the area of Ilesh in an Imperium at Peace would
probably have just a few admiral type people (since it is interior to the
Imperium) whereas the Solomani Border or the Spinward marches may need an
Admiral for every two or three subsectors.

First Officers are one full rank below the Captain.

Engineering Officers are usually two full ranks below the captain, but at
least a Chief Petty Officer (I am not going to get into that pantheon of
ranks).

Medical Officers are of lessor or equal rank to the 1st officer, but
this is not too important. 

Section Heads (Gunnery officers, Flight Officer, etc) are generally one
rank below the first officer, but sometimes are of equal rank, especiall
if they are a lieutenant on a large vessel.

Some may say that Fighter pilots or pilots in general must be officers.  I
think that pilots are "specialists" and can hence be Petty Officers or
even Seamen...er, spacemen.  Most officers have at least some pilot skill,
however, and a helmsman on a large vessel (Destroyer or higher) will be an
officer most of the time.

Hope that helps and isn\'t too far from reality.  My sources are some
knowledge of current practice and extensive reading of 18th and 19th
century Royal Navy fictional history (Hornblower, Aubrey/Maturin) which
makes an excellent basis for a Traveller/Imperial Navy backdrop.

I treat this kind of thing the same way I would for normal space. Your
ship 
can be depressurized in space. The only difference here is that you (the
person being spaced) could not be rescued after you leave the airlock 
(assuming you\'re wearing a vacc suit) because you\'d vanish into the
depths
of hyperspace.

I\'d suggest that a nonstreamlined ship operating in a standard or thicker
atomosphere would have a X percent chance (where X might be around 5%) per
hour in flight of suffering a sensor hit (like battle damage) due to air
resistance damaging external antennae.  Positive mods would apply for
dense atmospheres and (especially) high speeds; negative for pilot skill.

Not all sensors would go out.  Some might be taken off-line and the sensor
antennae stored aboard ship, if you had time to plan things out; others
(e.g., visible-light cameras, simple radar/ladar) need have little
external structure to catch the wind, and would thus be pretty safe.

> Try landing that
> vertical deckplan now, since your bridge is ontop.

Actually, any sensible designer puts the bridge in the *center*, or as
near it as possible, since you don\'t want your ship\'s brain getting fried
by a shallow penetration.  I\'m sure that any ship big enough to have
multiple decks does all its normal flying (in vacuum as well as in an
atmosphere) based on remote sensors feeding data (visible light, radar, et
al) to the bridge, rather than "looking out the windows."  For safety, you
might rig an emergency pilot\'s station with a window somewhere, with just
enough controls to land/dock the ship in a crisis.

This is actually a good point, and explains why unstreamlined ships would
not be welcome in the atmospheric traffic patterns of civlized worlds --
they can\'t control their positions reliably enough to follow the pattern,
and thus would be a hazard to themselves and other vessels.

However, on a less-populated world, with little traffic, dancing around a
bit on the way down might not be a problem, nor would (necessarily)
landing 500 meters away from the spot you aimed for...though the latter
could be *very* embarrassing if you were aiming for, say, a small island
in a swamp... :)

There is absolutely no good reason for a CG-equipped ship to re-enter at
high speed -- outside of combat situations, that is.  If you really want
to baby your ship, you can match rotational speeds with the planet, just
above the atmosphere, hovering on CG and a tickle of thrust.  Then simply
idle the engines and gently waft downward.  Re-entry at 50 km/hr is not
going to create much heat -- and gets you from near-vacuum to dirt in
about 2-3 hours, for an Earthlike world.  Those with more guts, or more
spare external antennae, might drop a little faster and cut the elapsed
time accordingly.

The problem is a little bit more complex than I thought, but for those 
who want to put some semblance :-) of scientific reality in a science
fiction game, here are some ideas (some from Traveller material) to 
allow an intellegent guess.
You can make a ballpark estimate of a world\'s surface temperature
(TNE World Tamer\'s guide, if nothing better) given an orbit distance
and the star\'s spectral classification. 
The most probable speed for a gas molecule is given by 105 * sqrt (absolute
temp/molecular weight)
TNE extended world generation gives you a table with estimates of surface
gravity.
Escape velocity at the surface is Sqrt(2 * surface gravity * planet radius)

If the most probable velocity is greater than escape velocity, then the gas
will certainly escape. 
Even if the gas has a lower escape velocity, there is some tendency for it
to "evaporate". This depends in a more complex way on the gravity and size
of the planet, and the density and temperature of the atmosphere, but I
would assume that if the most probable speed is more than about 1/10 the
surface escape velocity, the gas will be lost.

Definitely the first and probably the second rule should give the minimum
size a world needs to be to retain a given gas (regardless when or how it
got it in the first place)

That\'s an extremely crude oversimplification, but given the other
approximations, it should be close enough for Traveller.

"Down in Flames" was written by Niven (with the collaboration of some of
his friends) as a sort of joke, or alternate-history exercise, or whatever
you want to call it.  He wanted to explore the history of Known Space from
a conspiracy theorist\'s viewpoint, trying to come up with novel ways to
read "canonical" events which would yield a wildly different set of "real" 
meanings.  He succeeded brilliantly.  Having read DiF, I\'ll never look at
Known Space quite the same way again.

"Down in Flames" is the very *opposite* of canonical.  Ummm...let\'s
see...*heretical*!  Yeah, that\'s the ticket!  Burn the heretic!  BURN!

I couldn\'t find the reference again, but FFS mentions that a ship 
achieves hypersonic speeds when ascending to and landing from orbit.
If this involves going through an atmosphere, any part that offers
excessive resistance to airflow is going to get hot and take damage.
Hence the need for at least some streamlining.

In an environment saturated with hydrogen, the elements we want forming
macromolecules by combining with each other have some tendency to combine
with hydrogen instead. While Hydrogen is good for life, (it makes its
compounds volatile liquids and gases instead of intractable solids) it is
possible to have too much of a good thing. 
I enjoyed Hal Clement\'s "Mission of Gravity", but his hydrogen-breathing
Mesklinites are unlikely at best. Beings on a hydrogen-rich world would be
trying to eliminate excess hydrogen, and would require energy to do it.

For this reason, I consider the middle-hydrogen worlds as the most
favorable places for life to flourish.

Planets that cannot hold their hydrogen with gravity are likely to lose it
from its compounds as well, especially if they are in inner orbit zones.
Ultraviolet light can dissasociate the molecules, liberating hydrogen,
which then leaks away, enriching the planet in the less volatile elements.
For possibilities of life, this is mostly a Good Thing.

For purposes of investigating biochemistry, I will add one element at a
time to the mix. Next on the list is oxygen.

Oxygen

Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the (known) galaxy, and its
principal compound with hydrogen is therefore probably the most abundant
compound. (this is good news for us water-users).
The bad news is the ancient spaceman\'s lament: water, water, everywhere,
but not a drop to drink. Stars are far to hot for water to exist as a
compound. It\'s probably present in the deep layers of gas giants, but
that\'s no place for critters with notions of space travel to go looking for
it. If you don\'t mind it being strictly a mineral, you can go to the outer
zones of solar systems. If you bring it in to warm it up, land it quick
before it sublimes like dry ice. Liquid water is rare and precious.

Free Hydrogen and oxygen will not coexist: given between a microsecond or a
few thousand years, depending on conditions, they will form water. So, as
far these two elements alone go, you can have water in a hydrogen
atmosphere, or water in an oxygen atmosphere. (The water may of course be
solid, liquid, or vapor)
Life can reverse the combining tendency and split water, (given an energy
supply) but won\'t do it without a good reason. In hydrogen rich
environments, water is the best source of oxygen, while in hydrogen poor
environments, the hydrogen is wanted. Terran photosynthesis is an example
of this second process.

Life\'s foolish preference for water in its liquid state restricts it to a
fairly small zone of world temperature and size. Maybe it\'s time to bring
in another player: nitrogen.

That depends on which version of the the rules we apply.  Admittedly, all
the basic books refer to ships turning over, but in (I believe)
the Starship Operators Handbook, they were pretty specific about the
directions and the amounts of thrust a M-Drive could generate.
Regardless, if you advance the technology for steering jets and attitude
thrusters proportional to the technology for the main drive, you end up
with some pretty powerful little jets, capable of spinning a ship pretty
rapidly (the only way to get effective manuever/evasion against agile,
intelligent seeker missiles).

Granted, I didn\'t think that through very well.  I was attempting to imply
continued thrust through an attitude change, which would minimize some of
the forces I think would be generated.

However, if you are going "north" and the computer decides that the
optimum evasion solution is going to be 15% thrust "southwest" coupled
with a 15 degree/second spin for 5 seconds to bring a masked battery to
bear, you\'d best have either good mechanical restraints or intertial
compensation to keep you off the viewscreen!

I guess I don\'t see what is so unrealistic about WWII dogfights in space.
They were realistic then, and in Vietnam, and in Korea, and in Desert
Storm.  The only difference is that the technology keeps improving, making
them more and more extreme.  And having served on board a Navy ship, I\'ve seen
(and felt) the "normal" manuevers that are used at sea to simulate such things
as avoiding a torpedo, maneuvers that I think would very much apply to space
combat, but with a third dimesion added as well.  You do what you have to
to save the ship, and clean up the mess later!

Everything presented in "Down In Flames" in non-canonical for Known Space.

Yes, but why?  If you have a reactionless M-Drive capable of 1-G thrust,
and are launching from a world that has a gravity well of .9 G, then you
are going to lift whether you are streamlined or not.  Ditto for re-entry.
There is no reason, except to save time, why you have to make a hot
reentry or take-off...is there?

That they AIRED that episode of Voyager seems to me to be a sign of
desperation.  What a stinkburger.  Everything good in that episode was lifted
from ST:IV "The Voyage Home," and everything bad (most of the episode) from
the depths of Hell.  To make this somewhat Traveller related, thank God (aka
Marc Miller) that Traveller has avoided time travel as a plot device
like...like...like Voyager avoids original writing.

Joe,

I got in touch with the folks at Authority Publishing, and here are the 
costs for ammos of various types:

10 Shells                                =  1% of the cost of the weapon
 1 Clip (Empty)                          =  1% of the cost of the weapon
 1 Laser Weapon Battery Pack Recharge    =  1% of the cost of the weapon
 1 Laser Weapon Battery Pack Replacement = 10% of the cost of the weapon


Hope this helps,

- -Joe

A good, if a little dated, article on this (what sort of atmospheres 
planets are likely to start with, and how life, using various 
elements or compounds to live on, would change things) was penned by 
Asimov in the essay "Planets Have an Air About Them" (reprinted in his 
_Only_A_Trillion_ collection).

   I expect no starships are going to be landing like the shuttle.  
Consider that the common Fat Trader masses 2400 tonnes, empty.  This 
is 30x the shuttles mass (similar wingspan at ~30m), and 6x that of a 
747.  It\'s a brick with stabilizing fins (though a step up from the 
Free and Far Traders).  I expect that except for specialized craft, all 
starships will be VTOL, or require interface craft if contragravity 
is not available.

   Kim is senior enough that he should be a lieutenant at this point,
especially when you consider how much time he has aboard Voyager.
 Unfortunately, Voyager seems to run into everybody BUT Star Fleet Command
(sort of like the Castaways of "Gillian\'s Island" kept having visitors but no
ride home), thus his promotion has been delayed.

   While it was certainly not the worst episode of "Voyager" I have ever
seen, it certainly doesn\'t rank among the best science-fiction I\'ve ever seen
either.  It just amazes me that substandard sci-fi like "Voyager" continues
to live off the reputation of the Star Trek/Paramount Empire, while shows
like "Space: Above and Beyond" die premature deaths.

>  To make this somewhat Traveller related, thank God (aka

>like...like...like Voyager avoids original writing.

   Time travel works as a plot device in sci-fi (millions of Robert Heinlein
fans can\'t be wrong), you just have be very careful how you employ it.  It
worked quite well in an epsiode of "Deep Space Nine" last year (the one which
explained the infamous Roswell Incident).  

   The basic plot of "Voyager" is suppose to be one of travelling through a
region of space where no Federation types have ever been before.  The
"Voyager" episode in question violated the basic plot.  The script writers
for "Voyager" also routinely violate Star Trek canon (i.e. the Warp 10
"barrier" nonsense), have destroyed enough shuttle craft to convince me the
Voyager is in fact aircraft carrier, and have killed enough crew for me to
conclude that they must be cloning replacements.  None of these things have
helped the show\'s popularity with long time Star Trek fans.  

   Things to think about when people talk about doing away with any
established canon, and changing the basic game mechanics to fit new story
lines....

The various planet detection groups that have found these planets have a 
strong selection bias for things close to their star, and for massive objects - 
they haven\'t yet reached the point where they could detect Jupiter at jupiter-
distance around another star. So gas giants close to primaries probably
aren\'t *common* - just not-unheard-of. Various models now exist for either
(a) forming a gas giant at that distance or (b) moving one in from the outer
solar system to the inner.

P.S. By an odd conincidence, as I type this I\'m sitting in the control room of
the telescope (Lick Observatory 3-m) where most of the extrasolar planets have
been discovered.

It\'s raining.

How about limitations of exposure to other materials, like metals,

They are realistic IN ATMOSPHERE.  

An airplane is acted on by four forces: (i) the thrust of its engines, (ii)
the drag caused by friction, (iii) the pull of gravity, and (iv) the lift
provided by its wings.  In space, the force of gravity can be essentially
ignored, there is no atmosphere, and thus effectively the only force is that
of the manuever drive.

When you change direction in an aircraft, virtually all of the necessary
force is provided by the atmosphere acting on the wings.  When you change
direction in space, you spin the ship to point the drive in a different
direction, then thrust.  If you are not thrusting, you are in free fall. 
When you are thrusting, the internal thrust vector is always along the same
axis.  If you want to slow down, you spin the ship so the drive points in the
direction you are travelling, then thrust.  The internal acceleration you
feel will be in the same (local) direction and when you want to speed up.

It is difficult to give this lecture without a blackboard :-)  I don\'t blame
you for feeling that what you have experienced on earth applies in space -
most of my students make the same mistake.  (Hell, look at how long it took
to discover Newton\'s Laws of Motion.)  

I haven\'t seen a science fiction movie or TV show that got it right.  A good
book for space combat sequences would be _Footfall_ - another one would be
_The Stone Dogs_ (about the only good part of that book, too).

Again, a ship changes direction using the force of the water on the hull.  In
space this doesn\'t apply.


>You do what you have to
>to save the ship, and clean up the mess later!

No arguments.  But this may well mean repairing damage while under attack. 
Being able to repair damage while maneuvering will increase your
survivability.  Read the last couple of chapters of _Footfall_: having been
in the Navy, you\'ll probably appreciate them, and they will give you a
graphic feeling for damage control in space.

- ----

One other point.  If you design a ship with vertical orientation, you can use
one less G of compensation.  Ie. if the ship is accelerating at 3G, you need
only counteract 2G (the remaining G is your internal gravity, which you don\'t
need to generate artificially).  If you are using fuel-efficient drives that
can burn all the time (ie. T4 reactionless drives not TNE HEPlar) then this
will save you expense and power.

To be totally clear, it would be "meter moved while under acceleration".

Except that after moving a meter, it isn\'t moving at one meter per
second. 

D=.5 at^2
2D=at^2
2D/a=t^2
sqrt(2D/a)=t

Since a=1, it takes sqrt(2) seconds to move that first meter, which
means it is moving at sqrt(2) meters per second (v=at). And the energy
checks out.
e=.5mv^2
e=.5m(sqrt(2)^2)
e=.5m(2)
e=m

Assume a radius of 10 meters. 15 deg/s=24 sec per revolution

a=4*pi^2*10/24^2
a=4*3.14^2*10/24^2
a=4*9.87*10/576
a=4*98.7/576
a=395/576
a=.69 m/sec or about 1/14th of a g.

You\'d need a 143 meter radius to get 1 g at 15 deg/s.

The planes are making manuevers that aren\'t *possible* without an
atmosphere & gravity.

In space you don\'t "bank" your fighter to make a turn. Instead you
point the nose towards what will be the center of a turn, and fire the
main engine (which is at the stern).

Ditto for many other manuevers. Since you don\'t have an atmosphere for
the wings to "bite" into, you can\'t generate turning forces that way. 

You\'ve grown up on a planetary surface and have a distorted notion of
physics. In 99.999% of the universe, you *don\'t* lose speed if you cut
your engines, and the *only* way to make a turn is to fire up the
engines.

In space things are a *lot* different. Try making some manuevers with a
ship using CT\'s vector movement system (which is quite accurate).
You\'ll soon see that turns and evasion just plain don\'t work the same
way.

Evasion will be a lot *less* abrupt and forceful. It has to do with
things like ranges and relative velocities.

Not a problem. At least not with a reaction drive. The exhaust &
velocity handle any "streamlining" issues. The exhaust tends to require
the tail end of the ship to be pretty impervious to high temp plasmas
anyway.

With Traveller drives the aid this gives is insignificant. Really. It
only helps ships with marginal drives. Like trying to take off from
Earth with a drive that maxes at 1 g. Anything else can just point the
nose straight up and boost.

Damned if I know. I don\'t *like* thruster plates. They require lots of
handwaving, but don\'t really add anything to the game except questions
about how they work.

I have no idea. But if it doesn\'t occur, it *should*. Otherwise the
g-comp system is "magic".

Possibly. It depends on how the grav system works. And, of course, it\'d
cost more. :-)

On a big ship that means you have an entire *hectare* of deck in one
"compartment". I know people whose *house* would fit in a 10 meter
square!

Well, I figure that pressure doors will be treated a lot like
watertight doors on ships, and fire doors in ships and buildings.

I used to work in a facility that had a main corridor as wide as a
street, and over a thousand feet long. All on one level except for the
engineering offices that got added on at one end. We spent a lot of
time walking from one end of that corridor to the other. I had friends
how didn\'t believe that I got "enough" excercise just by walking around
at work! (1000 feet from door to office, 1000 feet *back* to cafeteria,
then back to office, then all over plant servicing computers....)

Consider that winds regularly rip apart *buildings*. What do you do
when a 50 mph gust hits the nose, but not the tail? Or if you blunder
into a 300 mph jetstream. 

Airplanes are pretty strong too. And "microbursts" have been known to
drop a plane several thousand feet in *seconds*. If that happens to
you, and you are only 1500 feet up, you\'ve just crashed.

Heck, I can\'t remember the number of times I\'ve seem semis that ran
into unexpected wind gusts with bad results. Your ship will have a lot
more "sail" area. And being non-airframe, the "center of pressure" may
be nowhere *near* the center of mass. In which case your ship is not
stable at *any* speed. 

Just as the center of mass is the point about which the ship tries to
pivot when "off center" forces are applied, the center of pressure is
the point where forces from "wind" center. If the CP is at or behind
the CM *relative to the "wind"* your ship will tumble end over end or
worse.

It\'s possible to *enter* atmosphere. It\'s not *practical* to do so.
Your ship is *inherently* unstable with respect to wind forces
(including the *apparent* "wind" generated by your passage thru the
air). As such navigation is next to impossible.

I\'ve had to deal with CP/CM problems in trying to design model rockets
and the like. So I do know what I\'m talking about.

It\'s not a matter of "dancing around". The steering thrusters are
designed around the fact that the ship pivots around it\'s center of
mass. But wind forces depend on the *shape*, not the mass. So a wind
from the side could exert much more force ahead of the CM than behind
it. Which means that the ship would be trying to swap ends! 

Vehicles intended to be used in an atmosphere are designed (mostly) to
not have this problem. Even trucks and cars!

Vehicles designed for space aren\'t designed that way. They may have
large, light structures in front with small, dense structures in back.
Think of a semi designed with the "tractor" at the back (and some sort
of steering for the front wheels). And have the "trailer" (leader?)
part empty. First strong sideways wind gust will push the "trailer"
sideways, while the tractor keeps pushing it forward. Unless you are
fast on the steering, it\'ll go farther off center rather than pulling
back *towards* center, the way a towed load does. So you wind up
tumbling end for end.

not the only one on this list who likes Trek.

I saw the movie tonight, and I\'ve got to say that it was pretty 
good--much better than Generations.

Prepare yourselves, I feel like rambling....

The Enterprise-E is a mean looking fighting machine, but I still hold 
the Enterprise-A (Kirk\'s movie version) as the best Enterprise.   It 
was my first love, and nothing created so far can come close to it.

I think whoever they had creating the modles for the first few movies 
does a much better job than the ships created for the new movies and 
shows.  All of my favorites came out of the first couple of Classic 
Trek yarns.  The Enterprise, the Reliant, the Klingon Bird of Prey, 
the Excelsior.  These ships blow the TNG Enterprise, Romulan War 
Bird, Voyager away.  

Another thing I like better about the old films is that a space 
battle was reminiscent of an old 1700\'s sailing ship fight.  Take the 
ship battles in Wrath of Khan--awesome!  In First Contact, the fight 
sceens are good, but the ships flit around like tie fighters from 
Star Wars.  This is very un-Trek.

Also, they\'ve never been able to come up with a uniform that compares 
to the red ones used in II through VI.  Those were the first Trek 
uniforms that looked like uniforms.  I like the current ones on DS9 
and Voyager OK, and I think that the new ones in tonight\'s movie are 
the best so for for TNG.  But, if it were my vote, they\'d still be 
wearing the red ones with the jacket and rank emblems.

I was hoping to be blown away with the new Trek movie, but I just 
wasn\'t.  Don\'t get me wrong--it is the best Trek we\'ve seen in a 
while--but it\'s definitely not the Wrath of Khan or the Voyage Home 
which are my favorites.  I\'ll give First Contact 3 out of 5 stars, 
and I\'ll probably see it again.

Picard did a wonderful job.  The show looked grand.  And I liked that 
data didn\'t look as pastey as he did in Generations.

All in all, I recommend the movie.

Babylon 5 does the most realistic \'cinematic\' space combat I\'ve seen.
The ships rotate and thrust to change direction.  They even rotate
and fire in a different direction than they\'re moving.  For extremely
realistic space combat, read Larry Niven.  Space combat is rare... the
weapons consist, usually, of com lasers used at short range and fusion
drive flames with a liberal sprinkling of nuclear and other bombs and
missiles.  An interesting combat sequence is an STL fight between
four Bussard ramjets over light years.  The closest the ships come
is light months and light lag is a big problem...

Well, most buildings that I\'ve seen or heard of that get ripped apart
weren\'t in great shape to start with.  All the big (read: large sail

If you\'re moving at 300 mph through the air and the wind changes or
the pressure changes, your lift will change quickly.  If you\'re
floating, then it won\'t.  For example, hot air balloons rarely go
jumping through the air...  A slow moving CG ship would maneuver
more like a dirigible than an airplane.

Again, semis are moving.  Also, they don\'t often get tossed off the
road.  Maybe very rarely in high winds.

Most ships have maneuvering thrusters that could compensate for
any off-center orces.  No problem.  If the ship starts to rotate
clockwise, apply thrust counter-clockwise.  If the ship is moving
slowly, then it\'s not going to go dancing around the sky.

I assume that these rockets are accelerating hard and moving very
fast?  If I were going to bring a big, lumbering, unstreamlined
ship into an atmosphere, I wouldn\'t accelerate hard or move very
fast.  I\'d take my time drifting down and move very slowly...
I would, in fact, behave as little like a rocket as possible.

        Leonard is, as usual, quite right.  Something the original poster
might want to do is to pick up a copy of Microsoft\'s Space Simulator.

[we interrupt this post to warn readers that Space Simulator is a typically
lousy Microsoft product: it does not run under W95 unless you use a DOS
boot disk, and is gravely deficient in many ways.  For example, the
autopilot\'s is not able to compute orbits; rather it does direct routes
under full thrust with turnover all the way, and has to do a whole bunch of
corrections after the midpoint to compensate for the destination\'s
planetary motion.  As well, it is incapable of handling Hohmann orbits.
And then there\'s the problem of it not letting you control time compression
while in autopilot...  So please do not consider this an endorsement.]

        It simulates the maneuvering requirements one encounters in space
rather well.  If you try and fly the ship using the same joystick and
thrust inputs as you would in a flight sim, you is going to get horribly
confused and disoriented.  You develop a good understanding of delta-v very
quickly.  Landings, using either the LEM or what they call the ATL, are
quite fun; you get a sense of the true meaning of the term "gravity well".

        It also gives you an excellent idea of the sheer scale of space.
Last summer, I did a bunch of flights with it where I would just set the
ship thrusting and leave it running in realtime, then leave for work.  I\'d
come home, make the neccessary corrections, read or watch some TV, correct
again before I went to sleep, and again in the AM, etc...  and this was
just bopping around the inner Solar System.  Space is big... even when
compared to running down the street to the chemist\'s ;).

        On the downside, it\'ll completely ruin a lot of bad SF for you :).

The book (A Darker Geometry, by Mark O. Martin & Gregory Benford) answers 
a number of questions posed by earlier works about Known Space.  The Kzin
aren\'t the tnuctipun.  According to other works I\'ve read in the Man-Kzin wars, all
current races in the galaxy evolved from the Slavers food source (some kind of 
bacteria I think).  However there have been at least two instances where Slavers
escaped the command of death.  One, along with his family & assorted slaves
was found in orbit around Alpha Centauri.  The other was evidently found by 
the ancient Kzin, or possibly the Jotoki (before Kzinti conquered them).  It just
hinted that the Kzin knew about them, and that was the reason for their 
full scale re-engineering of their species.  I guess that the Kzin could have been
an ancient relic (say left in a stassis field) that survived.

The point that I should have been trying to make is that Traveller ships 
are reusable and generally take everything with them, be it to orbit, or the 
next star system.  The Shuttle isn\'t a Space Ship in those terms, because
it doesn\'t even carry around it\'s manuever drives once it gets to orbit, yeah
sure the SSME\'s (space shuttle main engine\'s) are there, but have no fuel.
In a way it could be similar to a craft that uses an external jump grid 
(somebody mentioned something like this a few weeks ago) to send the 
ship to the next 1 parsec grid, with the grid staying behind.  Now you have
a ship without a jump drive that travelled to another star - system, but it 
still isn\'t a Star Ship.  The Shuttle likewise has enough fuel for it\'s orbital
manuevering engines & reentry burn, but couldn\'t get itself into space 
without external boosters & drop tank.  Once you have a shuttle that can
get to orbit (preferably without throwing anything except fuel overboard), 
refuel and fly to another celestial body, then you have a Space Ship IMHO
because it has the ability to travel between planets or moons.

I kind of break down the differences this way:

Ground to LEO Transport - 	any vehicle capable of taking a cargo from the 
				ground to low earth orbit.  This doesn\'t have to 
				be reusable.

Orbital Shuttle -			any vehicle even partially reusable that can 
				deliver a cargo from ground to LEO or LEO
				to ground.  This vehicle is at least partially 
				reusable.  Vehicles with short turnaround
				times are preferable (more missions = 
				more money faster).  

Space Craft - 		any unmanned vehicle that has the ability to 
				fly to another planet.  Gallileo or Voyager 
				would fall under this category.

Space Ship - 		any vehicle that can fly between planets inside 
				of a star system.  Any Ground to LEO Transport
				or Shuttle would qualify if they meet this requirement.
				(simply orbiting the same body & landing on it again
				doesn\'t count).  The portions of the Apollo missions
				that went to the moon are classified in this manner.

Star Ship - 			any vehicle that has the ability to propell itself
				from star to star.  Most Star Ships are also Space
				Ships.  You could probably argue that an XBoat
				isn\'t a Space Ship under this description and be
				correct.

Actually, I think I may need to rewrite my explanation.  I never intended
this system to be used "on the fly".  It was supposed to be used to create
trade tables, just as the animal encounter system creates animal encounter
tables.  I don\'t roll animals on the fly, and I don\'t roll trade goods on the
fly.

In fact, you are doing (I think) exactly what I intended!  That is, taking
the results created by the table _as a starting point_ and detailing them. 
Perfect!  This is what I do for all my trade goods.  (And, incidentally, all
my animals as well.)  My players _never_ have a hold full of "animal fibers";
instead, they have an assortment of "Gruntle Clippings, untreated".  (In the
same way, they are never attacked by a "10 kg gatherer", but instead a prime
specimen of the "Lesser Frumious Wombat" who has mistaken their satellite
uplink for a receptive female.)

>Obviously, some product (like Zilan Eiswein; see The Traveller Adventure)

In my game, most products (other than bulk commodities) are planet-specific. 
Remember that _every planet_ is supposed to have its own trade table, and
that every good is supposed to have a name (ie. not "bulk carbohydrate", but
"breadroot" or "yeast-cake" or "pressed purple algae" or...)

Actually, Generic Intelligence Analysis and Intelligence Analysis are only
two small parts of the Intelligence picture (the "tip of the iceberg", so
to speak).  If you\'re interested in creating a more accurate version of the
Intelligence career path, then the following skills are absolutely
essential:
  1.  Electronic Intelligence Analysis - the study of noncommunications
electronic emissions.  Decyphering the purpose and operations of enemy
sensor systems.
  2.  Communications Intelligence Analysis - the study of enemy electronic
signals related to communications.  Includes the study of enemy
communications encryption systems, telemetry, and instrumentation systems.
  3.  Technical Analysis - the study and exploitation of enemy technology. 
  4.  Linguistics - the study of the enemy\'s language.
      Psycholinguistics - the study of enemy psychology by studying their
language.
  5.  Infiltration - the gathering of intelligency by infiltrating enemy
bases.  Also called "HUMINT".
  6.  Intelligence Analysis - putting together all of the above information
in order to build "the big picture".

There are many other branches of Intelligence gathering, I\'m sure, and
there are probably techniques that our friends at the CIA and No Such
Agency know about that I haven\'t covered here, but that should do for
gaming purposes.

Hope this helps,

(In which ammonia-dwellers find the universe is biased against them.)

Nitrogen is third among the Big Four, and is likely to be found 
just about anywhere. Just as oxygen does, nitrogen combines with hydrogen.
The product is ammonia, and this is nitrogen\'s major 
source. 
Because of their combining tendencies, if you only had those two elements,
you would a choice of ammonia with excess hydrogen, or 
ammonia with excess nitrogen. Nitrogen, like oxygen, is gaseous.

Nitrogen does not have strong combining tendencies with
oxygen. Nitrogen oxides can be formed, but they require an 
input of energy. They are not major components of natural 
atmospheres under anything like earth-like conditions of 
temperature and pressure, and especially not 
in thin atmospheres.

Part of the bias is that nitrogen and ammonia with it are less 
abundant in the first place than oxygen and water are. If that 
wasn\'t bad enough, ammonia has a smaller molecular weight than 
water, so water sticks to planets better. Even worse, if cool 
your planet down, water condenses and freezes out first, 
while ammonia is still floating around in the upper atmosphere.
Worst of all, it is more easily broken up by ultraviolet light 
than water is leaving only the nitrogen gas behind.

Once you try introducing free oxygen into the system, however, 
the bias really begins to bite. First of all, you can forget 
about ammonia oceans with oxygen atmospheres. The oxygen gobbles 
up ammonia\'s hydrogen leaving you with water and nitrogen.
(Sound familiar, Terrans?)
This leaves you with a limited set of choices for three-element 
planetary envelopes. Type 1 is water-and-ammonia in hydrogen. 
Type 2 is water-and-ammonia in Nitrogen. Type 3 is water in
nitrogen-and-oxygen.
In the first two, you can guess which component, water or 
ammonia, is most likely to dominate. If you guessed ammonia, 
try again.
Overall, then, the universe is not kind to ammonia-lovers.
However, all is not lost. One of the Big four isn\'t vanquished 
all that easily. Terra itself had an early atmosphere, circa 
the orgin of life, without free oxygen, which suggests a type 1 
or type 2 atmosphere: Various lines of evidence suggest type 2 as 
more likely. Make the earth a little bit bigger, and further out, or
turn down the sun a tad...
Furthermore, ammonia is quite soluble in liquid water, which could help
preserve it. Also, water and ammonia have different temperature ranges
where they are liquid: If the water freezes out, ammonia oceans become
possible. These temperature ranges are also sensitive to atmospheric
pressure, and dissolved substances: but I am not so certain about the
details.

    'body' => 'The nitrogen gas present in type 2 and 3 environments is 
chemically quite sluggish, and there are two 
major ways organisms can incorporate it.

There are Terran bacteria which metabolize ammonia, releasing 
nitrogen gas and water, taking advantage of the reaction discussed
in Nitrogen I. If this reaction were reversed by connecting it to an
energy-generating mechanism like that of photosynthesis, it might 
provide a substitute for the oxygen-powered combustion reactions 
used in terran life.

The other process is used by terran life, and involves using nitrogen
oxides. Although these require energy to produce, Lightning provides a
natural source. Also, some plants are capable of fixing nitrogen
biochemically, though at some cost. Nitrogen oxides react with
water to form nitric acid and nitrous acide, giving nitrates and 
nitrites. 
Terran life uses these to store nitrogen in a more tractable form than
nitrogen gas, but in an environment where free oxygen is in short supply,
the nitrates and nitrites make an excellent way to store oxygen. The
chemical energy and oxygen stored in nitrates are in fact used by some
terran bacteria to support their life processes. Plants which make use of
nitrates and nitrites have ways to controllably oxidize them to the 
amines they use in proteins, and these reactions are in principle
reversible.

A plausible basis for an alien biochemistry would be for plantlike
organisms to photosynthetically produce ammonia and oxygen from nitrogen 
and water, and instead of releasing the oxygen, incorporate it with 
nitrogen into nitrates.
Animals eat the plants containing ammonium nitrates, and slowly release its
explosive energy, to power their life processes, returning nitrogen and
water to the environment.
Variant are possible, depending on whether ammonia must be generated 
or is available in the environment, and whether nitrates are available 
in the environment or must be generated.
Would this biochemistry be alien? yes. Impossible? Not necessarily. Its
components are known to exist. Rare, or abundant? Insufficent data.

On type 1 worlds, life is under the necessity to expel the excess hydrogen
from both water and ammonia; a considerable handicap for life.

However attractive this possibility might be, a combination of hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen alone cannot give us the large and varied molecules
and macromolecules that are characteristic of life. For this, we have to
have something like the last of the big four... carbon.

like most of the JTAS stuff).

Excerpts from JTAS #24:

Jumpspace by Marc Miller

      There are several different theories of jump space.....
      The basic concept of jump space is that of an alternate 
space......
      Entering jumpspace is possible anywhere,  but the perturbing 
effects of gravity make it impractical.....within (based on size, 
density and distance) .....at least 100 diameters out from a 
world...
      When ships are directed to exit jump space within a gravity 
field, they are precipitated out of jump space t the edge of the 
field instead.
      Jump takes 168 hours (+/- 10%)....Where time is a variable in 
normal space, energy consumption is a variable in alternate 
space....Consequenty, distance depends on the energy applied....
      One of the benefits of jump drive is its 
controllability....When known levels of energy are  e xpended, and 
when certain other parameters are known ...jump is accurate to less 
than one part per 10 billion....over one parsec,
the arrival of a ship can be predicted to within perhaps 3k 
kilometers....error in arrival....is affected by...quality of drive 
tuning and accuracy of the computer...these factors can increase 
the jump error by a factor of 10.
     ....when a ship exits jump it retains the speed and direction 
it had when it entered......A ship must take into account relative 
velocity between the two (star systems) when computing speeds and 
directions
      .....Jump uses large amounts of energy to rip open the 
barriers between normal space and jump space. Normally only fusion 
power can supply this energy. Some alternate systems make use of 
solar power or anti-matter power systems.
     Once power is generated, it must be stored until the instant 
of jump. Capacitors or large fast-discharge batteries fit this 
requirement.
     The hull of a starship must....withstand the rigors of jump 
space. The alien physical principles of jump space would make life 
impossible; operation of equipment unpredictable; even passage of 
time altered. Breaks in the protective network within a starship 
hull are a primary cause of the loss of ships in jump.
	Anything....becomes subject to.....jump space. People die; 
equipment malfunctions; small craft disappear.
     jump drives have precise power requirements which can only be 
met....under computer control.
     When the jump drive is activated, a large store of fuel is fed 
through the ship power plant to create the energy necessary.....the 
power plant does not work at full efficiency, and some fuel is lost 
in carrying off fusion by-products, and in cooling the system. At 
the end of a very brief period (less than a few minutes), the jump 
drive capacitors have been charged to capacity. Under computer 
control, the energy is then fed into approprite sections of
the jump drive....
      The drives first function is to tear a hole in the fabric of 
space....The drive then directs some of its energy to sewing up 
that hole....The act....severs the ties with normal space....

This is interesting.  I have my own way of reconciling gravitics 
and I\'ve chosen to use a description based off of a recent (1993)
research paper done on inertia and gravity.

The gist of it is that gravity is generated when particles are 
subjected to zero-point fluctuations.  Gravity under this 
hypothesis is nothing more than a VERY VERY high frequency
oscillating electromagnetic field that emmanates from every
particle (other than nuetrinos which may or may not have mass,
or possibly negative mass).  Objects have mass and attract other
objects of mass due to a phase shift in the zero-point fluctuations
brought on by the presence of the object.

Inertia on the other hand is very similar, but is mainly caused by 
the magnetic component of the zero-point fluctuations only when
a body is accelerated.

The paper implies that if you can generate an EM field of the 
correct frequency and shape around a vehicle, then you can
either increase or decrease the amount of inertia felt by that
vehicle when it accelerates.

I have taken it one step further to say that if you can create 
the right EM field around a vehicle (or any object) that is within
a gravity well, you can nullify the force of gravity on that 
vehicle.

For what its worth.

    'body' => '  The recent discussion about military intelligence and intelligence
careers in general reminded me of my own career and how different it
is from the impressions people tend to have of the intelligence field.
 The truth is, most intel analysts today spend most of their time
behind a desk analyzing and synthesizing the data that about 5-10% of
their peers actually collected and produced.  Since Traveller has
always been a fairly realistic game, I can see no reason why this
shouldn\'t be reflected somewhat accurately.  

  The few who actually do the intel collection will spend their time
wearing headsets, sitting behind a rack in a cold, cramped, dark
starship operating at minimal power and loitering at the edge of enemy
star systems, listening for any sign of enemy signals activity,
recording everything they hear.  They are likely to be assigned on
missions lasting one or two months at a time, leaving only at the end
of the mission or if they are detected.  It\'s tedious, slow, dangerous
work, with little chance of recognition or reward.

  Here\'s a design for one of the many collection vessels used
throughout the history of space travel.  The EMM systems and the extra
computers are designed according to Fire, Fusion and Steel.

					Fuel Rating:  95.4 Scoop/Refine 10
					Sensor Rating:  A10 P4 J4, EMM fitted
					Armor:  10		Structure:  11

	Built on a nonstandard, 300-ton streamlined disk hull, the SX-2250
HAWK WIND is designed to loiter at the edge of adversary systems and
collect intelligence data without attracting attention.  It is
equipped with a single laser turret in case it does have to defend
itself, but otherwise is not armed.  The ship=B9s primary mission is
surveillance, not combat.  It was first developed after the First
Interstellar War, and saw extensive service throughout subsequent wars
and conflicts.  The original design was never changed substantially,
although the systems were improved upon as technology permitted. 
	The SX-2250 is fitted with the best sensors, jamming and stealth
equipment available for a ship of its size, and has two collection
laboratories, each with its own TL-11 standard computer for analysis
and recording.  Each of these computers can be used as a backup for
the ship=B9s main computers if they are damaged.  The EMM equipment
increases the difficulty of adversary starships=B9 sensor locks by +1
level.  Its cargo volume is usually used for sensor decoys and extra
provisions for long missions.
	The following crew is required to operate the ship:  3 command, 2
electronics, 2 maneuver, 1 engineer, 1 gunner, 1 steward, and 10
intelligence analysts.

And they are actually kinda cute, at least when they\'re smaller than you
and are trapped in a tidal pool.  Just stick your finger into the pool it\'s 
in and it\'ll put out a tentacle to touch/grap you with.  Lost a couple of

Possibilities:
1. The ship could disintegrate.
2. The ship exits jump space and has a mis-jump, capable
    of placing it anywhere in open space between its point of
    departure and its destination.
3. Everyone & everything onboard is subjected to jump-madness
    for the duration of the trip (uh, no pun intended).
4. Nothing.  Because the jump grid isn\'t necessary once the
    ship is in jump space.  I used to take this as the ship being
    inside a small pocket universe with the boundaries being 
    a sphere centered on the ship.  As long as you didn\'t reach 
    the edge of the sphere you were alive, as soon as you 
    touched it you were lost to jump space.
5. The jump grid has been breached and the pocket universe
    the ship is travelling inside of begins to collapse.  Maybe 
    you can find a way to stop the collapse, or maybe you\'re 
    going to die.  It all depends on how far into the trip the 
    grid was breached.

I ussually use #4 when I run Traveller with jump drives.  It makes
for good special effects when you throw someone out the airlock
and they slowly tumble into the shifting surface of the bubble, 
followed by a large light show when their subatomic particles 
self destruct.  Really cool... Now everyone take 3D6 radiation
damage (haha ha)

reduce damage due to air friction during reentry.  This could
even be useful on fast airframe or streamlined ships that 
need to do a fast low level bomb run on a surface target.  
Poke sensors through the field, if possible, and hit the 
atmosphere at a speed higher than the max atmospheric

also serve to protect the vessel in case of anti-air or anti-space

The manuever drives in Traveller may require you to rotate and burn, 
but the way ships turn in Star Trek & Star Wars implies that they 
have partial inertialess drives which could allow you to turn that way.  
A truly inertialess drive would allow you to go from 0m/s to 
200 billion m/s (~2/3 LS) almost immediately, and allow you to 
make take any turn angle you want without feeling the slightest
force from acceleration.  

You play with the rules as given, or you change them and live with
the consequences of what your players can think of doing with them.
Having a true inertialess drive doesn\'t appeal to me, but you could
use it as a plot device in a UFO scenario.  Partially inertialess 
drives would allow you to bank, giving the ship a turn radius 
dependent upon the mass, velocity, and turn efficiency of the
engines.  Of course you could still manuever the old way if your

types. Its relatively lesser abundance and its affinity for oxygen and
similar behavior toward nitrogen do not further divide the classes much.
The classifications, and examples from sol system, are presented here

Type 1 environments.
Water, ammonia, and methane. Hydrogen present in excess. Unlikely to
originate or sustain life, due to hydrogen saturation of bonding
capabilities. In Sol sytem, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, though these
last two begin to approach a type 2 composition.

Type 2 environments.
Atmosphere nitrogen based. Water, ammonia, complex hydrocarbons and their
oxygen and nitrogen derivatives. No free oxygen. Most likely environments
for origins of carbon-based life. In Sol system, Titan. Earth was probably
once a type 2.

Type 3 environments.
Atmosphere largely nitrogen, with free oxygen, Water and carbon dioxide
present. May sustain life, but probably not originate it. In Sol system,
Earth. Mars may have been a type 3 once.

Type 4 environments.
Atmosphere largely carbon dioxide, possibly with nitrogen or oxygen or
both. Water not present. Probably do not sustain life. In Sol system, Mars
and Venus.

type 5 enviromnents.
No significant atmosphere. In Sol system, Mercury and Luna, Pluto, probably
others.

The general trend is with decreasing size and increasing temperature, which
have somewhat similar effects. 
It should be noted that there can be a great variety of worlds in any given
class, depending on temperature, atmospheric density, and details of the
composition. A planet is classed primarily by its atmosphere, with liquid
(if any) given secondary importance, and solids least.  

This classification cuts across the UWP physical profile, and so it is of
somewhat limited use. However, for world builders who would like design
their alien environments with some care, and not rely strictly on random
dice rolls, or those artists who desire a semblance of reality, this should
provide something of a guide.

    'body' => 'Carbon is the fourth of the big 4 elements, and necessary for most 
easily imaginable forms of life.

Carbon is mostly found in combination with hydrogen, as would be 
expected from the saturation of the universe with hydrogen; the combination
is methane.
A surplus of hydrogen in a system gives methane in a hydrogen 
atmosphere. Since methane is the lightest of the series, methane, ammonia,
and water, it is the most likely to be lost from a planet.
However, if breakup by ultraviolet light is the primary cause of loss of
hydrogen, then carbon is likely to be retained. Dehydrogenation of carbon
compounds gives rise to increasing numbers and varieties of hydrocarbon
compounds that are progressively heavier, wiht higher melting and boiling
points.

However, almost no systems are pure carbon and hydrogen, and given the
existence of hydrogen poor worlds, it makes sense to consider carbon-oxygen
systems. Carbon and oxygen, like the big four and hydrogen, but unlike
nitrogen and oxygen, form stable compounds with a release of energy, and
will not coexist for long as the pure elements.
Carbon forms two important compounds with oxygen: carbon monoxide, and
carbon dioxide. A range of proportions exists, but we can consider
environments to be oxygen-rich, which gives carbon dioxide and a surplus of
oxygen, and oxygen-poor, which will have varying amounts of carbon
monoxide.
Given the cosmic abundances of oxygen and carbon, you can expect most
worlds to be oxygen-rich in this sense. 
On hydrogen-poor worlds, you can expect significant amounts of carbon
dioxide, for at least four reasons. The lack of substantial formation of
nitrogen oxides leaves a carbon-oxygen combination as the next in line.
The general oxygen-richness of the universe indicates dioxide. Of all the
gases considered so far, carbon dioxide is by far the heaviest, and most
likely to stick to a planet. It will stick when even molecular oxygen and
nitrogen are lost.

The general progression goes something like this. On high-hydrogen worlds,
where there is a surplus of hydrogen, there is not much opportunity for
hydrogen-saturated oxygen and water to react. However, as the hydrogen
content of a system decreases into the middle hydrogen range, there is
increased opportunity for water to react with unsaturated hydrocarbons.
among the first and simplest of these are the alcohols. At a further stage,
there are the aldehydes and at a further stage, the organic acids.
Just as ammonia does not tolerate the presence of free oxygen, neither do
hydrocarbons in large quantities. They rapidly undergo combustion to Carbon
Dioxide and water.

The reaction of carbon and nitrogen is much like that of oxygen and
nitrogen: they can coexist almost indefinitely without reacting much.
Nevertheless, many compounds containing both carbon and nitrogen can be
formed with a modest input of energy. Binding with carbon has a stabilizing
effect on a great many nitrogen compounds. Some of the most important, such
as the nucleic and amino acids, have vital nitrogen components.

The dominant reactions of life,
Photosynthesis: water + CO2 = oxygen + carbohydrates, and
respiration, its reverse, should be too familiar to need 
an extended discussion.

For now, a closing summary will suffice.

I wasn\'t thinking of reactionless M drives and wouldn\'t use them... I was
thinking more FFS HEPlaR Drives. If you intend stay at orbital altitude,
you must either use your drive to counter the force of gravity, or achieve
the proper orbital velocity. If you\'re not going to take forever and a year
to get around in the solar system, you want orbital velocities anyway.
If you are in orbit trying to land, you must at the same time deccelerate
from orbital velocities and counter the force of gravity which is trying to
accelerate you. As a practical matter, it saves fuel to let the atmosphere
assist somewhat in slowing down.
Velocities that are quite slow by spacecraft standards are very fast in
atmospheres, and even the modest acceleration you mention can give
hypersonic velocities in the upper atmosphere.

Birds don\'t possess complex enough brains to really make an uplift
realistic.  There is already an octopod, aquatic race (The Githansko?) What

and aggressive tool users already, and a sentient breed would be a great

The easiest way to describe vectored thrust for the layman is: "Ever play
the arcade game, Asteroids? It\'s like that - only in 3D." (Even better is
the old "Spacewar" game, with a star at the centre of the screen, so the
players have to compensate for the effects of its gravity.)

>I haven\'t seen a science fiction movie or TV show that got it right.

Some day I\'d love to see someone attempt to do space combat in a movie or
TV show that was as close to 100% \'realistic\' as possible. When I say this,
people always object, "It\'d be too dull - no sound of explosions, no
aerial-style dogfights, long delays in the action while the ships turn
around for another pass..." I disagree. It could be highly suspenseful and
scary. It would only be dull if handled without imagination, and the type
of space-dogfight you see in Space: Above & Beyond (any all other space
shows & movies) is highly unimaginative.

Consider Clarke & Kubrick\'s _2001_. The space scenes are all as close to
realistic as 1968 movie tech could make them, and today they still look
utterly unlike those of any other movie (except, notably, IMAX movies shot
aboard the Shuttle). The relative motions of spacecraft, planets, and
starfields provide a great sense of audience involvement (lots of people
start to feel spacesick during the "Blue Danube" station docking sequence).
As for the lack of sound in space, this can also have interesting dramatic
effects, as Kubrick revealed: recall the horrific desperation of Gary
Lockwood\'s character, trying to reconnect his airhose, while spinning off
into nowhere, with absolutely nothing on the soundtrack at all.

You can justify some movie sound effects by pointing out that "false sound"
is a common movie technique (like when Woody Allen can be heard arguing
with a friend in the midst of a crowd, though we see them in extreme long
shot). But it would be interesting to do a space combat sequence in which
the only sound you hear is what gets transmitted over intership comms. No
explosion when a ship gets hit - perhaps just a truncated scream and burst
of RF static. And the explosions wouldn\'t look like billowing clouds of
smoke (as in Star Wars), another hold-over from WWII movies; instead: a
brief flash of light, and chunks of debris spinning off in all directions,
glittering streamers of ice crystals as the atmosphere escapes and
freezes...

Today, with computer animation and simulated physics, there is no excuse
for continuing to show space combat as "just like" WWII. And if I see one
more show where spacecraft attack each other - always oriented along the
same 2D plane...aargh! Trek only recently stopped doing this - with "All
Good Things" - far too late, and they still do it on Voyager all the time.

If your space combat is "just like" WWII aerial combat, what\'s the point of
setting it in space at all? Have the characters fight in some planet\'s
atmosphere and have done with it. The entire point of setting a story in
space is that space is an alien environment where the old rules do not
apply.

Mind you, I once read an interview with one of the founders of Virtuality
Systems, makers of the Dactyl Nightmare VR game, and he said they had
developed a space-combat game that used somewhat realistic vectored thrust
- - the fighters could zoom around in three dimensions, the whole bit.
Unfortunately, nearly everybody who played it got motion sickness. The
realistic swirling of starfields (not matched by inertial data from the
inner ear) was just too much for their stomaches to handle.

I suspect humans are going to need some subtle modifications (genetic or
chemical) in order to operate real space fighters without constantly
throwing up.

In the first case, the results are unpredictable, but uniformly negative 
for the jetsam involved.  One \'documented\' case (which is detailed in 
DGP\'s "Starship Operator\'s Handbook", I think) involves a battle rider 
coming loose from its tender about halfway through a jump.  Somebody 
found part of an airlock from it many parsecs away and a couple of 
centuries later.

The players in my campaign disposed of an unpopular crewmember (read: 
ex-PC) this way.  Of course, the open airlock event in j-space showed up 
as a nasty red flag in the ship\'s electronic log (the post-Collapse 
equivalent of the all-knowing transponder log), which bought them some 
trouble (they managed to keep the RQS officer from comparing their 
manifest to their current roster, however).  Basically, as they saw it, 
the unwelcome slug coasted out the airlock, contacted the jump field, and 
disappeared in a blue flash.  Now he\'ll be precipitating randomly back 
into n-space at various locations throughout the Spinward Marches sector 
over the next couple of centuries.  If you\'re in the area, and hear a 
splash in your soup that wasn\'t your spoon, I\'d take a good look at your 
next bite...

As for the hull-ripping bomb scenario, according to the aforementioned 
Handbook, a sufficiently-large hull breach will actually cause the 
envelope separating the ship from j-space to protrude into the ship (due 
to destruction of the lathanum hull grid).  Remember that the complete 
destruction of the ship is about the only method available to Imperial 
science for effecting any sort of \'midcourse correction\' while in 
j-space.  Exploding a bomb on a PC\'s ship is a great way of coming up 
with new PCs.

    Well... blame the politicians and the media.  There are engineers who would

the sensation hunting media create the culture within NASA to do this.  OC

    Given Humanity\'s homicidal proclivities this appears to be the most obvious
explaination, however... like many others I have some problems with it.  That\'s
the RW however.  In the Traveller Universe though.....

    Imagine the situation as Grandfather and descendents found it.  Two closely
related species of evolving, tool using, upright bipeds in competition.  Its
quite possible that Grandfather simply picked one over the other and
slaughtered off the other with a tailored bioweapon virus.  Why, to create a
control group of course.  Remember that Humanity was functionally Grandfather
and descendents equivalent of pets/lab animals. ;)

The thing you have to keep in mind is that he\'s referring to FF&S, which 
lists reactionless M-Drives as being an \'alternate\' technology, not being 
an \'official\' part of the TNE-Version of the Traveller universe.  
According to FF&S, if you\'re using the official rules, you need to leave 
the planet quickly in order to spend as little reaction mass as 
possible.  Of course, since the TNE rules also allowed non-airframe ships 
to enter and land on non-vacuum worlds, it doesn\'t hold that all 
entry-capable starships had hypersonic airframes for hulls.  A ship with 
a Streamlined Sphere hull configuration could conceivably reach 1100 kph 
in a Standard atmosphere (and, unless you\'re applying the 
differing-aerodynamics rules from the "World Tamer\'s Handbook", 
presumably in a Dense atmosphere as well).  Of course, the rules state 
that such a ship could also skim fuel from gas giants.  I take that to 
mean that such a ship CAN reach hypersonic speeds within an atmosphere, 
but only in the upper reaches of one.

Now, as to the original question, I take that (hypersonic speeds in the 
upper atmosphere) to mean that certain activities, such as extending a 
passive sensor array or using space combat lasers are just plain not 
possible due to the slipstream.  I also take it to mean that, unless 
you\'re using rules that allow reactionless thrusters (such as T4), you\'re 
not going to get an unstreamlined ship to the surface of a non-vacuum 
world in one piece unless you\'ve got enough reaction mass on board to 
manage the constant course corrections and attitude adjustments 
necessary to keep your airspeed down and avoid a Wile E. Coyote style 
landing.

On second thought, I should allow that such a feat is possible given the 
right circumstances.  As the F-4 Phantom proved:  Given enough thrust, 
even a brick can fly.

It solved a lot of the problems I had with some of the rules.  For
instance, a 400 ton Fat Trader, able to push 1G, landing on a world size of
A (which means over 1 G of local gravity), how does it take off?  I had
been playing around with the idea of starship sized JATO units! :)  It does
allow for more agile ships, plus I liked the overdrive rule...it lets the
engineer have a bit more to do with the ship than just fix it.

Granted, but those stresses are going to be calculated and re-enforced.

Based on the ship designs I have seen, 10m would only refer to the smaller
ships; a100-ton scout/courier is 38m long by 24m wide at the base, the
200-ton Far Trader is 50m long by 29m wide.  I also think that the smaller
ships, especially those under 100 tons, should be able to spin MUCH faster
than 15 deg/s.

However, when you get up into the 1 Kton destroyer escorts, the 5 Kton
destroyer escorts, and then to the capital ships, we are talking about
ships with a radius\' that far exceed 10 m, or even 143 meters.  Those are,
as I understand the conversation, the ships we are discussing, no?

Keep an eye on Babylon 5. The manuevers are realistic. It\'s the ranges
and spacing that aren\'t.

You frequently see a ship making a firing pass, spin around so the
stern pointed in the direction it was travelling, and fire up the drive
to slow, stop and accelerate back for another pass.

What I\'d love to do is write a *good* space simulator, with
multi-player networking capability. You could do campaigns in "real
time". After all, in most cases you could see ships coming hours or
days in advance. So "scheduling" battles for when folks had the free
time would be workable. 

Design it to support Traveller-type ship design and then we don\'t
*need* combat rules. :-)

You missed the *critical* point. The forces from from whatever the ship
uses for steering *have* to be designed to exert forces centered on (or
perhaps "balanced around" would be better) the ship\'s center of mass.
That is, the forces will be set up with equal "moment arms" (force
times distance from center of mass).

Unless the ship shaped in a rather limited set of ways ("airframe") the
forces from air flow over the hull will *not* be so balanced. So a
steering system design for space *cannot* compensate for these "off
center" forces. And trying to will stress the ship in a manner it is
designed for.

But unless the CP & CM have the right relationship, you are in trouble.
As simple "rectangular box" with the center of mass *not* centered
(reasonable enough, put the heavy drives and powerplant at one end, the
cargo hold can be the "front half", gives more "unbroken" cargo space)
will be totally uncontrolable in atmosphere. 

It\'s not a matter of open structure. It\'s a matter of aerodynamic
forces and mass distribution.

Better talk to an experienced balloonist. Updrafts and downdrafts *do*
move them violently. Balloonists try to avoid such.

Check into why the US Navy quit flying dirigibles. They had two of them
crash in storms that weren\'t all that violent. They just couldn\'t move
fast enough to avoid them. And paid for it.

Your ship is moving too. And it *won\'t* be as aerodynamic as a semi,
nor will it have tire friction to help stabilization.

The thruster forces are centered on the CM. The wind forces are
centered on the CP. That\'s the problem. 

Here\'s an example. Assume a ship 60 meters long, with a CM 40 meters
from the nose (20 m from the tail). Assume a CP 20 meters from the nose
(40 meters from the tail).

	|----|----|----|----|----|----|
     nose		CP		CM		tail

The forces turning the ship clockwise (wind) can be treated as a pair of
vectors of equal but opposite magnitude, at equal distances from the
CP. The forces turning the ship counterclockwise (thrusters) can be
treated similarly except that they center on the CM.

So lets let each vector be 10 meters from the CM or CP respectively.
And of course, they are of equal magnitude.

                ^
                |
wind	|----|----|----|----|----|----|
                        CP      |	CM
                                v



	                	^
        	        	|
Thrust	|----|----|----|----|----|----|
                	CP        	CM      |
                        	        	v



Now we sum the vectors:

                ^		^
                |		|
sum	|----|----|----|----|----|----|
                        CP      |	CM	|
                                v		v


The vectors in the center cancel. Leaving you *still* spinning!

(The actual calculations are messier, but this gives a rough idea. And
I am quite aware of the oversimplifications and errors that displaying
it this way cause)

Thrusters set up for a space only vehicle won\'t be set up to supply the
"unequal" forces required to neutralize aerodynamic forces. Doing so
would be quite unsafe in space. 

So to land thru an atmosphere, you\'d have to virtually rebuild the
attitude control system *and* hope that the *new* stresses you are
placing on the structure (remember, it\'s braced for forces distributed
*equally* about the CM, as that\'s the only kind that occur in space)
don\'t break anything.

Airspeed is not a factor, except to the extent that the forces are
stronger at higher speeds. Model airplanes have similar problems, and
they aren\'t going that fast.

Doesn\'t matter. You are going to be moving. And the slower you move, the
*more* likely you are to run into winds moving *faster* than you are.

You can reduce *your* speed (relative to the *ground*. You can\'t do
anything about the winds. It does no good to reduce your speed to 10
mph, as you *will* run into winds moving faster than that.

Wind speed can change by 50 to 100 (or more!) mph in the process of
changing altitude by a couple hundred feet.

Those are "unusual" or "special" handling conditions, just the way
"pressure" or "acceleration" limits are special conditions now. 

But pressure and gravity fluctuations are going to be *common* in space
cargo handling. Even if the ship maintains a controlled environment,
you have to worry about transfer points. 

Combat damage gets interesting. Consider, if your ship gets badly
irradiated by a near miss and you are carrying a cargo of grain. If it
is food, then as long as there\'s no residual radiation, you can sell
it. But if it is *seed*, it\'s worthless. And no, you can\'t sell seed
grain as food. It\'s been treated with chemicals to prevent rot and the
like. 

Bulk chemicals will be fine in most cases. A few will explode. The only
other result for "bulk chemicals" and "radiation" is certain industrial
polymer bases. The radiation would trigger polymer formation, and your
tank of "aramid resin" would be a solid block of poorly cured plastic,
or a mix of "soup" and "fibers".

Worst possible cargo to be hauling if you get a radiation hit?
Unexposed film. :-)

Worst possible cargo for a loss of pressure hit? I dunno, how about
bubble-wrap?

Here are the various candidates I can think of:

octopi
squid
various primates
raccoons
otters
rats (they are *damned* smart for their size and survive damn near anything)
various feline and canine species
Bears

Consider an uplifted Grizzly or Kodiak. A Marine DI would drool at the

half a ton of muscle...

I\'d suggest that wolverines are bright enough for uplift, but probably
*way* too independent and agressive.

Doesn\'t work that way. The *mixture* has a freezing/boiling point that
varies widely with concentration. Phase diagrams of water/ammonia
mixtures are really weird. "Star Light" made good use of the
weirdnesses that result.

Excellent post! Very useful. One comment, though: Given the large size of the 
Imperium, I get the feeling that - unless the Navy is very top-heavy - in many 
cases you\'ll see lower ranks given more responsibility. You may see a Cmdr in 
charge of an entire system, or a Captain in charge of a subsector fleet, 
because there\'s a huge amount of space and only a finite number of officers to 
go round.

	Actually, the seeds of the answer are right there in your
description of the problem: "...not matched by inertial data from the
inner ear..."

	Just set the inertial compensators so that they match ALMOST all
of the inertial force, leaving enough for the pilot to \'feel\' what\'s
going on. Much simpler than geneering your pilots.

	Another part of the problem that those game designers noticed
isn\'t only do to loss of inner ear cues, but to the fact that their \'3-d\'
representation doesn\'t quite match up with reality.  This was particularly
pronounced with DOOM...everything is mapped to a flat planar
representation of the  world, and they didn\'t model the curvature effects
that we are used to, and compensate for. This was aggravating the inner
ear effect producing things like Doomsickness. Yes it\'s real, and is the
reason I can\'t play Doom, or other such games any more.  I got really
caught up in Doom II one day, and played for about 6 hours straight...when
I pulled away from the computer, I was suddenly dizzy, extremeley
nauseous, and had a roaring headache.  Now the memory is such that all I
have to do is look at a few seconds of movement on a Doom screen, and I
start getting queasy.

I watch it when I can.  Agreed about the ranges and spacing.  Hadn\'t noticed
the maneuvers, but then I haven\'t seen that many episodes - I can\'t get it
here, so rely on tapes scrounged from more fortunate people.

Any chance of your posting a TNE/Brilliant Lances version?  (Or emailing me
enough design data that I can run one up myself?)  I liked your design, but
because of a fundamental disagreement with the T4 ship combat rules (ie. they
give me a pain in the fundament) I still use TNE.  (Come to that, I still use
TNE rather than T4 for everything.)

 This is mostly correct for US forces.  In peacetime, it appears
 that the rank of Commodore is renamed to "Rear Admiral Lower
 Half", and Rear Admiral is "Rear Admiral Upper Half".  During
 wartime, it reverts to the above.

 This may not actually be correct, at least with US forces.  I
 know of several Coast Guard ships that were commanded by
 persons of rank Commander, for example.  However, the
 officer-in-command of any ship is universally addressed as
 "Captain" regardless of actual rank.  This even includes a
 Seaman Recruit placed in command of a rowboat.  Incidentally,
 there is only one person aboard a ship afloat who is addressed
 as "Captain"; this is the officer-in-command.  I have heard
 that a rank Captain riding as a passenger is either given a
 courtesy promotion to "Commodore", or is addressed by the land
 forces equivalent, "Colonel".

T::>Commodores are a special case.  Historically, Commodore was a rank between

 Yes, except as noted above; the equivalent rank for peacetime
 (at least in US forces) is RALH, with RA becoming RAUH.

 Note that your way works nicely as well; this is not to say
 that you\'re _wrong_, just pointing out a familiar-to-many-on-
 -the-TML alternative structure.  My Imperial Navy tends to
 parallel the structure of US forces fairly closely, although
 just out of pure orneriness (or sometimes to point up that it\'s
 _not_ the US forces) I\'ve occasionally changed the rank names.

  At TL-12, the distinction between collection and jamming platforms
becomes blurred as antenna sizes and power requirements both decrease
rapidly.  
  All designs are intended for use in hull size 300dTons.  This is a
good size for a surveillance platform, combining a small profile with
a decent internal capacity.  The systems above will fit in any hull
size from 300 to 1000 tons without changing the numbers.

        ICI Games, the guys who do Warbirds (a multiperson Internetted WWII
flight sim) are working on something they call Planetary Raiders.  It will
allow for multiperson play and ship customization.  However, it sounds way
arcadey, because they seem to be avoiding the same kind of constraints you
mention.

        Space sim wise, what I\'d like to see would be a) Mac compatible, b)
have a decent autopilot so you could do realistic trajectories, c)
extensive design capabilities, and d) multiplayer capability, both
multi-ship and single-ship(!).

        Extreme, slavish adherence to the laws of physics is of course a
sine qua non :).

Spacecub is a plan that started out as a single seater sub-orbital "kit
plane"! They revised their plans a few months back to go after some
prize. So the revised design will be a 3 or 4 seater. Again VTOL. 

VTOL is popular because it lets you practice landings easily. You just
load up a *little* fuel, boost up a few meters and then throttle back.
Then you take progressivvely longer "bunny hops", until youare finally
landing after a fair amount of "free flight" time. Once you get that
far, all you need to worry about is the fun stuff at the peak of a full
powered flight (basicly re-entering at the right angle).

One interesting suggestion for the original Spacecub design was using
them for parcel express type services. They\'d only have a 600 km
cross-range capability, but they can cover that in less than 30
minutes. The scaled up design would be even better (more cargo space). 

"Sub-orbital Express. When it has to be there in an hour...."

Remember, once you get things scaled up a bit more, it\'s 45 minutes to
*anywhere* on Earth.

According to that same document, thruster plates can generate 
approximately 25% of their normal rated thrust in any direction 90 
degrees of the normal thrust axis (or, if you will, NORMAL to the normal 
thrust axis <g>).  Also, it specifies that thruster plates can be 
overdriven up to 400% of their normal rated thrust for short periods of 
time, say, short enough for a 1-G thruster-equipped ship to lift off.  Of 
course, back in the MT days, we just sort of IGNORED the fact that, with 
your thruster plates in the aft part of your ship, your center of thrust 
isn\'t going to be anywhere near your center of gravity.  The CT-CG 
problem is fixed in T4 with contragravity units that not only negate 99% 
of the pull of gravity (as in TNE/FF&S) but also impart thrust, which 
would serve to keep the ship stable/level as it lifts.

At least, that\'s all the handwaving that *I\'m* willing to do...

This is probably echoing or contradicting a whole bunch of posts which I 
haven\'t seen yet.

Of course, the sad thing is is that it\'s just our atmosphere he\'s talking 
about.  On worlds with a higher luminosity factor (sun is hotter and/or 
planet is closer to it), a greater axial tilt, a greater atmospheric 
density, or any combination of these factors (plus whatever ones I\'ve 
failed to mention), the figures named above will seem to be like a polite 
belch in comparison.

So, what color is YOUR parachute?

One ticklish situation that comes to mind is with the former Soviet navy, 
where ship commanders were backed up (read:  overseen) by political 
officers who often also held captain\'s rank.  As far as I know, the 
commander of the ship still had seniority, if not higher rank, than the 
zampolit, but I\'m not sure that this was always the case -- I\'m just a 
layperson here, not a subject-matter expert.

For those of you who didn\'t know:  The zampolit\'s function was to ensure 
that the ship commander\'s decisions were \'politically correct.\'  The 
parallel command structure was developed to insure that military units 
always acted in the best interests of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union.  With all of the different, wacky political and military entities 
possible in the Traveller universe, such a parallel command structure 
could be present in a different form with different names.  I\'d like to 
think, however, were I a captain under such circumstances, that I\'d be able 
to find safe, deniable methods for wearing out my political officers quickly.

I even read "Star Light"! (don\'t rememeber the name of the world).
I still don\'t think Mesklinites would breathe hydrogen any more than a fish
drinks water.

I didn\'t think through the ammonia-water sytem completely.
One possibility is that dissolved ammonia would drastically lower the
freezing point of an ammonia-water solution. Water dissolved in ammonia
might lower its freezing point slightly. At a certain concentration, the
mixture would have a minimum freezing point.
With mixtures richer in water than this concentration, the ice would freeze
out first, and concentrate the ammonia in the water, while with mixtures
richer in water, the ammonia would freeze out first. If this 
is the case, you would be correct and their would be no pure ammonia
oceans, only mixtures. On the other hand, the boiling point of a
water-ammonia mixture should undergo a steady decrease, as the ammonia
concentration rises. In any case, the gas or vapor should be richer in
ammonia than the corresponding liquid.
The various melting/freezing points and condensation/boiling points depend
on the concentrations of the components and their pressures. The
meteorology of any such world would be indeed be quite complex.

The prime characteristic of a type I environment is an excess of hydrogen,
so that gas giants, Mesklin itself, and the other world you mention all
qualify, despite their great differences.

A better tactic for targets that don\'t shoot back is to point your ship and
guns toward them, and drives in the opposite direction. With any kind of
velocity vector perpendicular to that direction, if you fire your engines
at just the right power level, you circle the target.

I thought we were discussing races that the Solomani had geneered... are
the Githansko such a race, or are they native to their planet?

Uplift does not necessarily have to proceed to full sapience (however you
define that) and some of the birds are quite intelligent already.

I once drove by a hawk that was sitting in the road eating roadkill. Most
birds fly away when a car approaches them, but this one calmly sat and
watched me go by, since I was in "the other" lane. Pretty smart, for a
birdbrain. Maybe it\'s just prejudice, but I\'d try a parrot, raven, or
raptor before I\'d think of a kangaroo.

In TNE, neutralizing (most of) the gravity is the work of the CG lifters,
leaving the 1G maneuver drive free to do the remainder plus accelerate the
ship to orbital velocity, or deccelerate to the proper surface velocity
from orbital speeds.

     intel careers, how about this idea: 
     
     A _single_ skill (Intel; so named not to be confused with Intelligence 
     characteristic), based on INT and EDU 
     This skill allows gathering of various information together into an 
     integrated picture, and permits prediction of future activity based on 
     knowledge of past dispositions and behaviours. 
     
     Difficulties depend on the task, eg: 
     
     Basic information about adversary (eg typical weaponry, equipment, 
     racial characteristics): 2D difficulty
     
     Detailed information about adversary: (common tactical responses to 
     combat situations): 3D difficulty
     
     Close analysis of adversary dispositions: (likely positions of enemy 
     based on partial data) 
     
     Deep analysis of adversary: (analysis of commander\'s objectives and 
     means used to achieve those objectives)
     
     However, Intel skill cannot be used on its own. The Intel officer must 
     possess a complementary skill to build up the Intel picture: 
     
     eg Intel & Tactics - battlefield intelligence analysis, prediction of 
     enemy behaviour
     Intel + Recon - analysis of close recon and tracking data 
     Intel + Criminology - analysis of criminal activity
     Intel + Sensors - detection of enemy via remote sensors
     Intel + Computer + Tactics - creating computer model that simulates 
     enemy behaviour in a given tactical situation. 
     
     USAGE: 
     *Lowest available skill: eg Intel-3 and Tactics-2 would allow a roll 
     bonus of +2 for a battlefield intelligence analysis. 
     
     *Double roll: for more detail, roll using both skills and the results 
     will more closely explain partial successes 
     eg Successful roll for tactics, failure for Intel = good data, 
     analysis error
     failure for tactics, success for Intel = good analysis, based on bad

     success for tactics, critical failure for Intel = good data, 
     disastrous analysis ----> very bad tactical error
     etc etc  etc. 
     
     Intel + Leadership = \'leader\' can combine the abilities of a number of 
     additional Intel analysts up to the level of their Intel or Leadership 
     skills, whichever is lower. All team members must have at least 
     Intel-1 in order to participate. 
     
     This allows the construction of Intel \'teams\', which can combine 
     available skills together. A well-functioning Intel team can use the 
     best available Intel skill with the best available of any other skills 
     as part of their Intelligence analysis. 
     eg A team consists of the following members: 
     1. Intel-3, Leader-4
     2. Intel-2, Tactics-4
     3. Intel-4, Sensors-1, Tactics-5
     4. Intel-1, Recon-3 
     
     The team leader can combine team skills of a maximum of three members 
     excluding themself. Thus the team has available: 
     Tactics-3, Recon-3, Sensors-1, Leader-3, Intel-3. 
     
     <level-3 is maximum because of the team leader\'s level of intel 
     expertise, but team member 3. could work on their own for better 
     results>

Only if they insist on looking out the window!

I imagine that space fighters use a VR imaging system that "edits out" 
the starfield. All those points of light would be distracting. Planets, 
other charted bodies and the local star (sun) would still show on the 
visual, and facing and location of the fighter would be shown by a 
directional marker on a static map. The only swirling on the map would me 
the relative movement of nearby spacecraft and what-not.

Space combat in Traveller, by its very nature, is slow, methodical, and 
strategic. More of a naval battle in three dimensions than any dogfight. 
The distances in space combat mean it would be useless to fight 
"visually" as you can\'t even *see* the enemy.

Here are some questions regarding QSDS.

1. Sensors. QSDS gives sensors ratings like AxPpJj. It then uses them
in combat. 

I am wondering what kind of information one can actually get from 
a sensor. For instance, can a sensor tell the operator which kind of
weapons a ship has and the quantity?

Can they read the serial numbers off the ship?

Can they count the hairs off the pilots nose? 

Just how much can they do? 

2. Standard Hulls. I noticed that QSDS creates a bunch of standard hulls which
have each place structural limits on the number of G\'s that the ship
can pull. For example a Far Trader is built with a Box S hull with 
a maximum acceleration of 1 G. 

Has anyone created any rules to allow players to modify the hull to 
increase its structural integrity.

I leave ship\'s gravity on, acting on the assumption that I can\'t have
inertial compensation if I don\'t.

If you don\'t have a functioning ship\'s gravity, can you still use grav
lifters?  Do they require a g-field to push against?

Also, I wouldn\'t want to depend on a fragile electronic gadget to do the
lifting - if the ship takes a hit or does a quick burst of accel to evade
and the g-belt gets pinched between the heavy object and a wall, the belt
is a lot more likely to break down than a simple cart is.

DC gangs in combat are pretty likely to just grab the part and lug it
rather than try and hunt down a grav lifter - besides, murphy being murphy,
there\'s a good chance that battle damage has either obliterated the supply
locker with the g-lifts, or made it so you can\'t get there from here.

The numbers are the sensor short range in old-fashioned Brilliant Lances
Hexes (1 hex=30,000km.) Out to the sensors extreme range (8 times short range)
it can succesfully lock onto a target - which gives you about 5-10 pixels
across the target\'s hull, enough to identify the class.

At shorter ranges (2-4 times SR) it could begin to identify non-standard
features (extra turrets) and gain information about an unknown class.
At the listed short range it can easily detect small hull features like
airlocks or markings.

So, in a non-combat situation, a P4 sensor could identify a ship\'s class
at 8x4x30,000 = 960,000 km; it could count turrets at 480,000km, read
the registration numbers at 120,000km. 

In combat, using the T4 rules, I would say that getting a succesful sensor
lock lets you determine the class - for seeing more details, use the
distances above. (T4 range bands are 10/20/40/80 hexes, so the P4 sensor
could count turrets at short range (T4 bands are very short/short/medium/long,
right?) and read registration numbers at very short.)

Some day, Derek Wildstar and I will write an article on this for JTAS...

Got your letter today, and there\'s a major problem - a cheque in US$ drawn
on your local US Bank is worthless locally (well, not exactly, but it
would cost me more than its worth in Bank Charges to "cash" :-(

AFAIR the last time I cashed a US$ cheque (royalties for Rigger Black Book
from FASA, several years ago), it was around A$6-7 to cash - *and* took
around 28 working days for the funds to clear, to boot :-{ I would guess
that our Banks\' current "user pays" drive of "rationalisatoon" would mean
that it has, at the very least, not gone down. This would mean your
US$6.50 (around A$8.12) would, at best, come close to the charges for
clearing it.

In case I didn\'t make it clear to anyone who wants to order a copy of
"Dark Star" #1 (and there are around 5 copies left at the special
introductory price, even after keeping two for Peter) at US$3/stg2, there
are really only five ways to get me the money -

1) Send me notes - US$3 (three x $1); stg2 - er, well, you *can\'t* do this
as you only have coins in this denomination (unless you\'re Scottish!)
now.

2) Go to your Post Office, and ask for *three* INTERNATIONAL REPLY COUPONS
(and if the counter Clerk claims they don\'t exist, politely ask to see
their supervisor, or that they look up their Handbook), each of which is
worth one *letter* rate stamp at the country it is cashed in (and, since
DS is larger and heavier than a letter, it takes around 2.5 to pay for
postage alone). Unfortunately, unless *your* Post Awful is better than
OzPost, these will cost considerably *more* than $3/stg2

3) Go to your Bank or Credit Union and get a BANK DRAFT in $Australian for
$3. Unfortunately, there is often a minimum charge over and above that for
the actual $3, which will make this unattractive in most cases.

4) Go to your local Bureau de Change or *large* Bank (probably only
possible in large, cosmopolitan, cities) and ask if you can buy $3 in
notes ... except that you can\'t do that any more, as *we* don\'t have $1 or
$2 notes any more (only coins :-(  ... so you\'d have to get an A$5 note
(Thomas Cook or similar travel agents may have small amounts of OzDollars
on hand as well, again, only in large and cosmopolitan cities).

5) Get a Postal Money Order for A$3 at your Post Office. But there is a
minimum charge, and this will cost more than option (1).

Anyone who doesn\'t like sending cash through the mails. Well, in 27 years
of purchasing stuff by mail order from the US and UK I\'ve never had any
problems with lost mail except once, and that wasn\'t lost mail - they just
claimed it was to keep the Better Business Bureau off their backs. So I
will get your letter/money. And, well, you can ask around the group - all
those people who have sent money have got their magazine promptly!

So, Peter, please contact me at the email address below and we\'ll see what
we can work out to minimise the delay.

IIRC, a future President,  Lieutenant (JG) John F. Kennedy, USNR, commanded
a small craft, PT-109, in combat against the Imperial Japanese Navy in WW2.
In consulting some of my other books on WW2 Naval history, Senior
lieutenants and LtCommanders commanded submarines . . . .

In Trav terms, this is what "feels right" to me (a former USN petty
officer):

	SDBs and Patrol Cruisers: The former command would be the billet of a
senior O-2 (LtJG in US terms), the latter a billet for a full Lieutenant
(O-3).

	DEs: A full Lieutenant, minimum.

	Merc Cruisers: Lt. Commander. I can check the RC Personalities book to see
just where in the rank structure "Hammer" Lathrop and "Who Me?" Ritter were
when they were assigned to the mercenary cruiser _Ashtabula_. 

	Auxillary Cruiser: In the TNE novels, the RCS _Hornet_, a converted 200
ton Far Trader, was                         commanded by a full Lieutenant
with the XO ranked as an Ensign. This may not be appropriate for a Third
Imperium-type campaign since RC is noted for it\'s informality and overall
make-it-up-as-they-go atmosphere.

	DDs: LtCommander, minimum. 

	Starburst-class CL : I\'d say a Commander.

	Planet-class CA and larger: O-6 Captains.

	XOs should be one rank lower, and no more. 

	Department Heads (Chief Engineer, Tactical Officer -- my campaign\'s  term,
borrowed from David Webber\'s _Honor Harrington_ series, for \'Chief Gunner\'
) -- 2 ranks lower. For small ships, these "department heads" may well be
Petty Officers or CPOs.

Which leads me to something I have long wondered about: at what distance in
space are ships, stations, etc., visible to the naked eye?  I realize this
will never come up in combat, but, say you are trying to dock at a highport.
 When can you actually look out the window and see it?  Anyone have any idea?
 Pure curiousity, witht the intent of adding more "feel" to my campaign.
 Thanks.

Your idea generally works for me.  I plan to write up the full house rule
"Military Intelligence" career sometime this week and post it by Friday,
barring unforseen conflicts.  Since I started the thread various people have
given me some great ideas of how to make it work, which I will probably quote
liberally.  I assume nobody minds, and I\'ll try to give credit where due at
the end.  If anybody strongly objects to me doing so (quoting, that is),
please e-mail me privately.

Well, OK.  There aren\'t many modern day (or Imperial British Navy) parallels
to Known Space in terms of scope, so this, IMHO, becomes a matter of opinion.
 So, without further ado, IMHO, I don\'t think so.  Maybe a Commander (even a
Lt. Cmdr.) would be given command of a small or less strategically important
system, but, fleets would probably be given to nothing less than a Commodore
(or Rear Admiral Lower Half, as the esteemed Jeff Zeitlin informs us.)  This
would tend to make the Navy a little bloated in it\'s higher ranks, but,
promotions don\'t come all that often, don\'t you know (only once per term.)
 Further, I imagine a subsector being (very) roughly equivalent to a theater
of operations in WWII, and, so far as I know, nothing less than an Admiral
(in any variety of flavors) was given charge of a theater.  Also, I\'m not
sure that a Marine or Army General might not have command of military
operations in some subsectors, at least in times of war.  After all, Stormin\'
Norman was (IIRC) the Supreme Allied Commander for Desert Shield/Storm,
responsible for the total action of all allied forces (Army, Navy, Air Force
& Marines from a smattering of nations.)  Perhaps, occasionally, a Major
General+ is given command of total operations in a given subsector, directing
Task Forces and Fleets (commanded by a Commodore or Rear Admiral) to provide
Naval support for ongoing operations.  If all three major forces (Navy,
Marine, and Army) are responsible for providing the top brass in any
particular theater (or subsector, or sector, for that matter) it would keep
any one service from carrying too much weight at the top.  Finally, I would
think, in a fuedal society, having many top officers would be an advantage
for nobles, as it would prevent any one Admiral from establishing a
significant enough power base to contest the rule of his local Marquis, Duke
or Archduke.  Whaddya think?

No doubt.  Though I have often felt that much of that collection process
would fall to the able hands of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, as
much as the "military" services.  According to CT Book 6 Scouts (an early
Traveller watershed for me) the scouts maintained an Intelligence branch as
part of the Detached Duty Office.  Many former (i.e., player character)
scouts fall into the jurisdiction of the Detached Duty Office when they
receive the scout ship benefit upon mustering out.  I\'ve always played it
that any scouts who have a scout ship are required to make routine reports of
where they\'ve been and what they\'ve seen when next they drop by a way station
or base.  This data is then farmed out to the Intelligence branch, who then
sends it to the appropriate Intelligence division (Army or Navy, depending on
the nature of the information) for further analysis.  Scouts make an ideal
choice for intelligence gathering because:

a.) They\'re ubiquitous.  You can\'t go to a system these days without running
into a scout ship delivering mail, mapping navigational hazards, conducting
detailed surveys, etc.  No better way to disguise a spy than hide them in
plain sight.

b.) They\'re not always "active duty."  Detached scouts can go almost
anywhere, do almost anything and are...

c.) Deniable.  Hey, the Scouts aren\'t "military."  Really.  That scout was
just in your system investigating reports of odd gravitic anomalies in your
planetoid belt.  He stumbled into a secret refueling base, you say?
Well...oops.  Sorry.

d.) They may be just a little bit nuts.  They\'re used to working alone, in
deep space for long periods, with little or no contact with any other living
thing.  Sounds like an ideal data gatherer to me.

So, you see, Jeff, I agree with your vision, (especially given your
experience);  I simply assume the role you talk about to be subsumed within
the existing careers, and the Intelligence Agent career to cover the
analysis, and "hot recovery" (which I have no doubt are not near as frequent
or fun as the people behind the James Bond franchise would have us believe)
aspects of the intelligence game.  

BTW, I really dig the ship design.  Spruce up the labs, and sensors, crew it
with some scouts, and if they get caught they can say they were only here
investigating reports of odd gravitic anomalies in...

Stewart:

You appear to be an educated and ethical individual. Therefore, I am
writing you directly, rather than through some impersonal legal counsel,
to put you on notice that you rather innocent use of the term "Psionics"
is a violation of a Copyright held by myself. Psionics has blossomed out
and is being used by a handful of people on the net. You are only one of
those. However, you seem to be one of the more intelligent. 

The terms "Psion" and "Psionics" were coined by my Mentor, Henry D.
Frazier and my self early in the 1950\'s. We defined "Psion: as: "The
smallest possible unit of life and sentience. Ie: the Life counterpart
of the material world "electron." The term Psionics, we defined as: "The
study, understanding and control of Psions and Psionics activity in
living systems. We incorporated the term "Psionics" in the name "General
Psionics" in 1959 and formed the Church of General Psionics and
(ironically, given the name of your Web et al) The Instute of General
Psionics (Incorporated in June of 1970). These terms were not only
Copyrighted by us, they were U.S. Trade and Service Marke by Mentor and
myself. While, in the late Seventies, following my Mentor\'s passing, I
changed the name of "The Church of General Psionics" to "The Friend\'s
Way of Self-Realization..." The name of the Institute has remained
unchanged.

I do not know how invested you are in your use of our term and our name,
but I must ask you to cease and desist from using that which was created
by and rightfully belongs to us and represents a REAL-LIVE Institute of
Psionics.

The problem is that the mere pattern of disappearing zampolits is

Wrong end of the scale.  The upper reaches of the atmosphere are
virtually stationary relative to the Earth as a whole.  It\'s only once
you get down to near the surface the air picks up enough speed to
nearly match the Earth\'s rotation.  Of course inbetween there are
various regions that travel faster still and have wildly varying
temperatures.

The atmosphere is not just one homogeneous unit which rotates with the
surface, and can be entered just by matching speeds, it\'s a chaotic
system with many (often unpredictable) changes at many levels.

You are not going to land any ship not designed to be streamlined, or
at the very least to take the shear stresses introduced by entering an
atmosphere.

The frequency of military or naval promotions in Trav is proportional to
the amount of "business" (action, combat, etc) a force sees. If the Navy is
busy, than there will be lots of opportunities for promotion or command --
especially in the case that Someone Screws Up and Mister JO inherits the
Job :)

Depends upon the size of your war. In the 5FW, perhaps this is the case (a
subsector = a theater), but not for the Rebellion/Final War/Second Solomani
Rim War/That Thing Virus Ended ca. 1130.

My take on Trav\'s services is that the Navy is the "senior service." Since
most interstellar military operations have _by definition_ a naval element,
there would be a tradition of the Navy taking the lead in most ops. Also,
consider that the Navy\'s upper echelons are usually drawn from the
nobility, whereas the Imperial Army will take damned near anyone and the
Marines care more about how many push-ups a character can do than his SOC.

Not to mention a place to deposit all those surplus children of the
nobility and a place where they may earn honors and even a patent of
nobility outside the family\'s holdings all in a socially-constructive
effort that holds the further benefit of being brutally Darwinian --
military failures in a dangerous universe usually die whilst failing.

1. I Psi: The PCs decided to escort Baroness Lita and Gamester (the
Engineer) on their trek across Stellis to the Solstice Gather, where they
hope to locate the medicinal herbs they need  to cure their jumpspace
intolerance syndrome. Lita does some research and discovers a theroetical
connection between jumpspace intolerance and psionics(!). With this, she
starts searching Stellis\' cities for psionic assistance. Lita has also been
"hearing voices" and picking up on stray random thoughts and emotions since
her bout with the JSI retrovirus, and she suspects that she may well
possess psi powers . . . and senses that unless she can get control of her
psi talents, she may become a psionic human time bomb.

With a little help, Lita finds someone who can help -- a NewAge
crystal-cruncher with a minimum of psi power but a lot of control developed
as a result of her mental and spiritual disciplines (low PSI, high skill).
Further, the psi\'s abilities are limited by her own belief in what is
possible. This makes psi abilities fairly common (in traditional Trav
terms) on Stellis, but the strictures of the Stellan religious tradition
prevent psi from dominating the society.

A cursory psionic exam  gives Lita a Psi of 5 (max for her age!) with
talent in Telepathy.

2. Hiking to Gather: The PCs gather their good weapons and supplies for the
trek. There are a LOT of dangerous animals in the Stellan backcountry, and
weapons are a Real Good Idea. Further, there are ugly rumors of banditry
and worse coming out of the boonies. The PCs buy some nags and pack mules
and head out. Why horses and not an air/raft?? Rumor also has it that the
locals react unpredictably to offworld transport, and that offworlders on
horses don\'t upset them.

The frst two days of the trek go well. The PCs are invited to camp that
night with a local couple making the same trek; and the PCs pick up some
more valuable information about the herbs as well as the Gather. The
characters take to hunting for the pot (as the game is very plentiful), and
whilst hunting encounter a party bent on hunting _H. Sapiens_ -- slavers.

The travellers, being the sort that hates slavers, decided as one to hunt
the hunters. The slavers went from healthy to dead in record time, and an
assessment of the evidence suggested that the slavers came from an area to
the northeast. At this point most of the trigger-pullers split off to hunt
down the slaver camp whilst Lita and Co continued on to the Gather. 

The strike team heads northeast and avoids getting lost (lousy maps, but
good Navigation rolls!). However, the point man of the team critically
blows two of three rolls to spot a slaver ambush and pays for his
misfortune with his life. The team fights back and breaks the hasty ambush
with only a couple of minor wounds. 

It was at this point that play halted -- some of us had to go to work :(

Pardon my complete ignorance on the topic, I must have fell asleep

What are zero-point fluctuations?
Are they fluctuations from +ve to -ve with zero as a baseline?

That\'s how I picture anti-grav, as a gravity nullifier. This would 
mean that you would require some other thrust agent. I\'ve always liked
that idea.

STAPLES FOR TLWH

That and the problem we had with keeping large enough margins for the side
cropping, i.e. some books have almost no margin. Needless to say at CORE we
respond to every customer comment. An emergency supply pack of 2 extra
strong staples and spare strips of paper to stick down the side of each page
are in the post to you even as I type this... ok, enough joking - TLWH was
my first enterprise in print and, needless to say, not perfect. There are a
couple of typos and a slightly misprinted map, which I saw the day I picked
up the first bound copy... comments like "Oh sh*t, how did I miss that?!"
were heard... which is why I can still, to some degree, sympathise with
IG/AP and the original T4 book errata. However, I would still appreciate
anyone who has TLWH to feedback any comments on the book, critical or
otherwise, so that future products can be improved.

And Allen, please e-mail me at A.S.Lilly@nortel.co.uk about those queries
you have re running it.

Judging by today\'s pilots, not quite. If you are asking more generally
should someone who can crash a million credit starship with passengers and
cargo be paid a fair whack, then I\'d say yes. I\'d be much more liable to
question the pay given to the less productive money-recycling and legal
careers found in abundance both today and (undoubtedly) in the future.

COPYRIGHT ON THE USE OF THE NAME PSIONICS

What a load of generic twaddle. Psi, psionics, etc. has been used for 20
years in Traveller without so much as a passing gnat taking interest in it.
The e-mail address and general attitude of this person clearly indicate that
they are talking b*ll*cks and are a complete and utter bustard (an
endangered Australian hunting bird according to Michael Barry).

I\'m no lawyer (and I know there are TML members who are), but could I humbly
suggest that it is best not to ignore such trite, but to state clearly that
the term "psionics" and all associated _fictional_ references to it and
psionic institutions, has been used, unchallenged, for over 20 years within
the Traveller RPG, which has had a distribution of tens of thousands of
people across the world. There is thus no way in which this term could be
regarded as a trademark or "copyright" (as he claims) any more than Hoover
corp take people to court for using the word hoover to mean vacuum cleaner.

Now, if your specific use of the word psionics somehow interferes with
people doing web searches for this guy\'s site, you could, out of the
kindness of your heart, try to rectify that?

Well, most buildings that I\'ve seen or heard of that get ripped apart
weren\'t in great shape to start with.  All the big (read: large sail

If you\'re moving at 300 mph through the air and the wind changes or
the pressure changes, your lift will change quickly.  If you\'re
floating, then it won\'t.  For example, hot air balloons rarely go
jumping through the air...  A slow moving CG ship would maneuver
more like a dirigible than an airplane.

Again, semis are moving.  Also, they don\'t often get tossed off the
road.  Maybe very rarely in high winds.

Most ships have maneuvering thrusters that could compensate for
any off-center orces.  No problem.  If the ship starts to rotate
clockwise, apply thrust counter-clockwise.  If the ship is moving
slowly, then it\'s not going to go dancing around the sky.

I assume that these rockets are accelerating hard and moving very
fast?  If I were going to bring a big, lumbering, unstreamlined
ship into an atmosphere, I wouldn\'t accelerate hard or move very
fast.  I\'d take my time drifting down and move very slowly...
I would, in fact, behave as little like a rocket as possible.

My problem is that I havent the resources (timewise) to come up with a
specific table for every planet after carefully examining the UPP and
deciding on the other planetary features.  I want a \'quick stop\' to drop
off and pick up cargo at a few spots.  More detailed adventures await down
the line a bit.

Hence the cargo lists based strictly on the type of product as determined
with the trade code as the primary determinant.

Sometimes this will mean that different planets in different areas of the
Marches will have the same type of \'animal fibers\' or other commodity,
since they rolled the same result.  This is OK as long as the main table
is big enough for this to be rare.  If it happens rarely it can be
described as a successful import.

Some more common items, like iron ore or bauxite, need no explanation when
there are duplicate results on different planets.  These kinds of things
should make up the bulk of the table.

So yeah, I am doing what your instructions specify, only I\'m trying to do
it in "bulk" as it were.

Actually, it was Norman Spinrad.  The complete text is available at
http://hops.wharton.upenn.edu/~loren/Links/world-design/down.in.flames.html 

Note that there are at least two versions of this essay:  the original 
(published first in a fanzine about two decades ago, AFAIK) and a modified 
version published in one of the recent Niven collections (_N-Space_, I 
believe).  The version at the web page above appears to be the original.

Note that DiF predates _Ringworld_; some of the details of Known Space have 
evolved in a way inconsistant with DiF.  After Ringworld, Niven decided he was 
not tired of Known Space after all.

Good point!  If the system or area is a true backwater there may only be
enough ships to justify a Captain.  I would guess, though, that the
lightest weight you\'d see is a Captain for any area to speak of.  Remember
that Imperial area commanders may need to face down minor nobles with a
complex on occassion.  If that commander is a pipsqueak Commander or Lt.
Commander, no one will listen to him.  

Not that being posted to a backwater is exactly a prime posting.

Several game systems have been using the term Psion & Psionic for

My understanding of how copyrights work is if somelse uses your 
copyrighted blank, you can force them to stop by law.  But if they 
don\'t contest and several people start using it, then they have lost 
the right. e.g. Fimica is example of this.  Everyone started calling

1) Has anyone else had anything from this guy?

4) How does this effect GDW/IG\'s use of the term Psionic Institute?

5) Anyone any idea if using a copyrighted word in a fictional setting

You appear to be an educated and ethical individual. Therefore, I am
writing you directly, rather than through some impersonal legal 
counsel,
to put you on notice that you rather innocent use of the term 
"Psionics"
is a violation of a Copyright held by myself. Psionics has blossomed 
out
and is being used by a handful of people on the net. You are only one 
of
those. However, you seem to be one of the more intelligent.

The terms "Psion" and "Psionics" were coined by my Mentor, Henry D.
Frazier and my self early in the 1950\'s. We defined "Psion: as: "The
smallest possible unit of life and sentience. Ie: the Life 
counterpart
of the material world "electron." The term Psionics, we defined as: 
"The
study, understanding and control of Psions and Psionics activity in
living systems. We incorporated the term "Psionics" in the name 
"General
Psionics" in 1959 and formed the Church of General Psionics and
(ironically, given the name of your Web et al) The Instute of General
Psionics (Incorporated in June of 1970). These terms were not only
Copyrighted by us, they were U.S. Trade and Service Marke by Mentor 
and
myself. While, in the late Seventies, following my Mentor\'s passing, 
I
changed the name of "The Church of General Psionics" to "The Friend\'s
Way of Self-Realization..." The name of the Institute has remained
unchanged.

I do not know how invested you are in your use of our term and our 
name,
but I must ask you to cease and desist from using that which was 
created
by and rightfully belongs to us and represents a REAL-LIVE Institute 
of
Psionics.

  realistic."

So I would have said before I saw the articles on an African grey parrot
(weighs about a pound, has a brain the sixe of your thumb, max), named,
I think, Alex.

Alex can imitate human speech, like lots of parrots, but he has also been 
trained to, well, converse on a limited range of subjects.  It goes like 
this:  They show him a trayful of items (and perhaps allow him to examine
them further by picking them up or nibbling them).  They can then ask 
him questions about the items like:

	How many are blue?
	How many are round?
	How many are metal?
	How what color are the square ones?
	What shape are the metal ones?
	Pick out the round, blue one.

Etc.

My feeling is that Alex is AT LEAST as bright as a very bright dog.  
I feel that a gene-tooled parrot of, say, the size of a bald eagle 
could loft a brain that might well leave the humane laws behind for 
civil rights.

"But the brain is so small!"  Well, yes, but look what Alex can do with 
his tiny brain.  Maybe, in all the tens of millions of years of separate 
evolution, off parallel to mammals, birds have developed a more compact 
neural architecture than us.  After all, mammals have seldom had the same
selection pressure to squeeze a lot of function into a little mass that 
birds have generally had.

Well, if you\'re using a computer this is not more tiresome than creating
animal encounter tables - at least until you have to name all the products
:-)  Metator, for example, generates trade tables automatically, just as it
generates animal encounter tables.

What you could do is create \'generic\' tables for each type of world, rather
like the CT supplement 2 did for animal encounter tables.  I would suggest
splitting these into low-mid-high tech, Ag, In, Na, Ni, \'other\' trade codes
for a start.  This gives you fifteen tables to create - hardly onerous if you
plan on using them for all of your campaign.

I suggest that you have a spot in these generic tables for \'planetary
speciality\' - something that is _only_ found on that world.  If you can\'t
come up with something on the fly you can always reroll, while if you can it
will lend a sense of depth to your campaign.

That said, I do have software that will create the \'bare-bones\' goods very
quickly.  (Rather like churningout thousands of animals.)  I can always
create tables for you if you want them.

GUYS IAM GETTING SICK AND TIRED OF GETTING THE ABOVE LINE.  A systems
engineer is one who acts as a go-between for mechanical, electrical,
manufacturing, and chemical engineers.

The fact that he is jewish did have nothing to do with it.  I had about
30 seconds to type the post, so in the rush I added some extraneous
detail.  Will people pull their heads out of their arses and look at the
REAL detail instead of straining at proverbial GNATS?

The "institute" is a legend among Forteans..  Stage magic mixed with

They\'ve been very quiet for the last few years.  Perhaps this a last gasp

Since the Psionics Institute has been a staple of Traveller since 1977, and
hasn\'t been challenged by these idiots yet, they have no case. Remember that
some of the nastiest battles in the RPG industry have been over copyrights.

Well, if I have a character drink a Coke, the nice folks at Coca-Cola
probably won\'t object.  If I write a book claiming that Coca-Cola was the
downfall of western civilization, then I can expect a visit from lawyers
who\'ve had their sense of humor surgically removed.

I would\'nt sweat this.  If he writes back, just tell him to come to England
and file suit in your courts, since that is where the computer hosting the
page is located.

The Ancients took Terran wolves and turned them into Vargr.  When the
Solomani started uplifting species they would look at man\'s best friend
and start playing.  If people are playing with Kangaroos, than I am
sure they have played around with dog DNA.  

These dogs wouldn\'t look at all like the Vargr. A TL-20+ society turned
wolves into an upright fully sentient species. The TL-14 Solomani\'s
uplifted dogs would be fairly stupid, (1d6 for intelligence??) and
probably wouldn\'t be fully upright, probably have the ability to walk
on hind legs, but better able to run on all fours.

Actually, during the Battle of Britain, many of the Spitfires and Hurricanes
were flown by RAF sergeants.  The German Luftwaffe also had many enlisted
pilots, mostly in transports and as instructors.

The US Marine Corps had trained a number of NCOs as pilots in Central
America and China during the \'20s and \'30s, but the Navy was shocked at the
thought of mere enlisted men (and Marines at that!) flying their precious
fighters.  During WWII, many of the flying sergeants were quietly given
commissions to provide replacements to the badly hurt VMFs in the Pacific.

If you think of a system defence boat sort of like a coast guard vessel, it
would make sense for it to be commanded by that Master Chief Petty Officer
with time of service marks up to his shoulder.

I just spoke with a former Naval officer (US Navy).  You don\'t even have to
be an officer to be given command of a vessel.  Some high-ranking enlisted
types can command vessels -- like tugboats!  Oh, you were interested in
command of military vessels?  Gotta be an O5 or better.

Here\'s a list of USN ranks and some examples of vessels they may be in
charge of:

O1 Ensign - tugboat
O2/O3 Lt - minesweeper
04 Lt Cmdr - amphib
05 Cmdr - destroyers, subs
06 Capt - cruisers, a/c carriers

by the time you get to the Admirals, a two star (Rear Adm) commands a
battle group and a four star (Adm) commands an entire fleet.

So, extrapolate this to the Imperial Navy, and you could tell who commands
what!

Here we get to the meat of the issue.
	You cannot copyright a phrase.  Thus they do not have a valid
copyright claim against you.

You CAN trademark a phrase...  However the usage restrictions on 
trademarks are MUCH less.  Basically they would have to prove that
your usage of the term diluted their trademark usage.  Since you are
using a term in use within a fictional context that does not refer to 
their work, or their area of work, it would be difficult for them
to prove it.  In the US this never the less could be expensive for 
you (you have to cover your own lawyers fees in civil cases).

See my answer to number four.

NOTE:  I am not a lawyer nor do I play one on TV.  I\'m just concerned 
about these issues as a gamer (see T$R\'s attitude) and a filker.
There is an EXCELLENT FAQ covering these issues that appears in
the FAQ archive and occasionally on news.answers.  

Read the FAQ for better information.

[etc]

This guy sounds like a total crank, a loon, or a prankster: note that he
signs himself by "A. Friend" - an obvious pseudonym. I doubt that he can
claim copyright without giving his real name. And I don\'t think he or his
"Mentor" can legally claim any exclusive right to the word "psionics", any
more than Isaac Asimov can force US Robotics to pay him for the use of his
term. It may well be that "A. Friend" and/or "Henry D. Frazier" actually
did invent the term, but if so they obviously failed to keep control of it
in the 1950s. It has long since passed into general usage.

Here\'s a quote from the entry on "PSI POWERS" in _The Encyclopedia of
Science Fiction_, by John Clute & Peter Nichols (St. Martin\'s Griffin,
1993): "John W. Campbell, Jr....also popularized in the mid-1950s the
related term "psionics", which he once defined as "psychic electronics";
one of the earliest uses was in Murray Leinster\'s "The Psionic Mousetrap"
(1955)."

Notice that Leinster\'s story and Campbell\'s articles pre-date by several
years "Friend & Frazier\'s" supposed incorporation of the term in "General
Psionics" in 1959. Of course, Campbell may well have picked it up from
Frazier and his Friend. But if they didn\'t even try to stop Campbell and
Leinster from using the term back then, they can\'t legally try to stop you,
me, TSR, GDW and a thousand SF writers from using it now.

Mind you, if this guy wants to come out of hiding behind his pseudonym and
actually sue you, he could still make your life hell. I doubt very much if
he could win, but if he has lots of money (or is a lawyer himself) he can
throw nuisance suits at you until you capitulate. Pointless litigation has
become America\'s favourite passtime.

But a legal threat by e-mail is just that: an empty threat, harmless
electrons, as useless as a threatening phone call. The courts demand paper.
Until you receive a registered letter from his lawyer, you can claim you
haven\'t heard a thing from him.

If he\'s serious (or seriously crazy), living in Old Blighty may or may not
shield you; somehow I doubt it.

Hope this helps,

	Regina is kind of special in the sense that you cannot enter it until you 
have another artifact obtainable _only_ when you solve the megacorporation 
conspiracy subplot.
	There are lots of clues, hints, tips and information about the
megacorporation 
conspiracy, the bulk of which are designed to confuse and act as red herring.

To pursue this subplot, first visit the planet Rugbird and pick up all the 
truth drugs you find there. During you travels, you would come across some 
Vemene thugs, some would shoot at you, and some you can interrogate. Quite a 
few of them on various planets will tell you that they come from the prison 
planet Huderu.
	Go to the planet Jae Tellona and buy passes for Huderu and Pscias. Visit 
Huderu and talk to the prison Warden Cruxlic. Interrogate and/or use the 
truth drug on him until he tells you about Grazer on the planet Pscias. Visit

Grazer on Psias. (You will have to fight a few battles to get to him, so 
save the game first when you first land on the planet.) Talk to him to get 
the name of the person who hired him to kill you.
	Next visit Tukera headquarters in Ragid Town on the planet Junidy. Talk to 
Jelika Chan. Interrogate and then use the truth drug on her. Learn about 
Lie Ioccocco on Loneseda. Visit Ioccocco on Loneseda. Talk to and interrogate

him to get the names and locations of the 4 Tukera subsector chiefs. The 
name of one of the chiefs should be very familiar to you. Why, that\'s the
same 
person that Grazer told you! Go to the planet that Ioccocco told you and 
track down this person. Once you find him, the conspiracy is solved and you 
will obtain the artifact needed to enter the Ancient site on Regina.
	You should also take a trip to the planet Lewis to gather the conspiracy 
evidence for the duke back on Rhylanor to tie up all the loose ends. Why 
Lewis? You\'ll know once you solve conspiracy!
	Once you have visited all 11 Ancient sites, you should have 36 coyns in your

possession. USE the coyns and you will be told where to go next. Just follow 
the simple instructions and you should be able to get to the game ending 
sequence very shortly.

Far Trader and fly around in a big and nasty Jump 4 starship that requires 
no fuel? Of course you would. And it is relatively easy to do: First visit 
the Ancient Site on Patinir to retrieve the fuel cores. Then go to the 
planet Ylaven _in your own ship_. Do not take a charter or a commercial 
liner. Why? Because the Ancient ship is _not_ on the planet Ylaven. It is 
near the Gas Giant! When you are in that planetary system, go to the gas 
giant to refuel. You will take over the Ancient ship in no time at all!

Hello,

I\'m new to the list, and I\'ve never written anything to it, but I thought
that I would on this letter.  Pardon any nettiquette screw ups.

If you read in the RCEG, it explains that CG does create a field where
gravity is nullified.  It\'s description is in with the Grav Belt and Grav
Bike "broomstick"

Hope this isn\'t just restating the obvious.

Dammit!  Over the weekend I get to deal with a nice, manageable one or 
two digests per day and then, in twelve hours, SPEWWW!!!! I\'ve got FOUR 
in my in-box.

That doesn\'t bother me so much as the fact that SO MUCH of it is waste.  
We\'ve already discussed the duplicate messages, and arrived at the 
conclusion that it\'s nothing that the list subscribers can help.  What we 
CAN help is the reply quoting.

I saw no less than THREE COMPLETE COPIES of the forwarded e-mail from 
that "A. Friend" crackpot.  WHY?!?  Why on Earth (or anywhere else) is it 
necessary for me to see the same thing THREE TIMES?!?  There IS NO GOOD 
REASON, darnit!

Here\'s a hint:  Instead of quoting the WHOLE MESSAGE you\'re referring to, 
trim it down to the RELEVANT PARTS.  Go ahead and TRIM OUT the whole 
previous discussion unless it\'s absolutely necessary -- it\'s already been 
seen, okay?  Whenever possible, summarize, just so long as it doesn\'t 
kill the context.  Instead of reposting that crackpot\'s ENTIRE LETTER, 
you could just say:

[crackpot\'s letter snipped]

and people who hadn\'t just come out of a coma yesterday would know what 
you\'re on about.

Also, please, please, PLEASE don\'t repost somebody\'s lengthy article on 
the new Intel skill just so you could put "Great!  I liked it!" at the 
bottom.  That\'s STUPID!  If all you\'re going to do is pat the guy on the 
back, do it in e-mail, for crying out loud.  If you\'ve got nothing new to 
add to a thread, then DON\'T ADD TO THE THREAD.

For those of you who actually take heed:  Thanks for listening.
For those of you who don\'t:  If you want to shut me up, you\'d better.

I\'m more reminded of the scene in _HFRO_ where Captain Raimus _kills_ his _zamploit_ and 
makes it look like an "accident," just before the defection begins.

Now _this_ is exactly why I think the Nth Interstellar War/Beginning
of the Rule of Man milieu is sooo exciting...

"Lieutenant Mason!"
"Yes Sir!"
"You have been placed in command of the newly captured Vilani system
Messurkesshur. Requisition a staff and take the USS Powell. It\'s approximately
2 months away, solid jump. Don\'t waste any time, as the garrison
fleet has to move on ASAP. Waste time and they\'ll leave before
you arrive and that would _not_ be a good idea."
"Aye, aye Sir!"

Little does poor Lieutenant know that Messurkesshur has a population
of 6.7 billion, a subgitaed and irritated lower class of local
minor race humans, a rather put-out upper class of Vilani nobles
who really don\'t like the Terrans much more than the old Empire, several
orbiting spaceports, a couple in-system mining & farming colonies and
oh, did I mention that USS Powell used to be the USS Polo, recently
returned from its refit to ship of the line from garbage scow?
Luckily, he\'ll probably still remember a lot of his Naval Academy
knowledge, after all, he graduated only 22 months ago...

You\'d think the (temporary) garrison fleet would be more careful with its
intelligence reports...

It\'s like putting the PCs into a sort of Deep Space 9 type situation,
except much, much, MUCH worse. Lots of fun though. 

If and when I ever manage to get a campaign running in ole\' TO,
I\'m definitely going to go for this kind of background.

I suggest that Jo Grant is also ROFL. Obviously, Jo didn\'t receive an
email from this "A.Friend" character.

I think there is a high degree of probability that Jo, seeing the absurd
email received by Stewart Eyres, forged her/his own Email using
Stewart\'s as a template, substituting Stu\'s website with her/his own,
and Psionics Institute with Traveller\'s Aid.

I say this with confidence, since simple comparison reveals the same
spelling mistake in the preamble (not part of A.Friend\'s email), which
BTW is also worded the exact same way: "I don\'t normally forward emails
in their entirey,"
	                                       ^^^^^^^

Not only have y\'all been had by this quack named "A.Friend" but Jo has
added his/her own little sly twist to this debacle.

Good job Jo! ;-) I admire your sardonic wit.

Page 69   "All units (enemy or friendly) in a firing unit\'s line of fire are
potential     
                targets."

Page 72   "All targets along the weapon\'s line of fire and in the same range
band as 
                the primary target are attacked by the fire (at full
penetration for the range    
                band); others in the line of fire but in different range
bands are not."

               "The target closest to the firing unit is attacked first, then
the next closest      
                (target means active units in the fire\'s danger space,
regardless of hostile  
                or friendly status."

Errata, Re: Page 72, Line of Fire (addition)
               "The target closest to the firing unit and in the line of fire
is attacked first, 
                ignoring all friendly units.  However, if exceptional failure
occurs when 
                rolling a hit, then friendly units are included when
determining the 
                closest target."

So, if a PC is aiming at an enemy who is 40m away, and there are friendly
units at 
     2m and 17m and enemy units at 7m, 19m, and 45m, then how do I figure out
who    
     he hits?

PC--F----E----F--E----P----F
            \\________________________/
                           med. range

Does he have roll against the enemy at 7m first, then 19m, and then the
primary 
     target?  If he hits one, then are the rest of the targets still at risk?
 How many 
     enemy can be hit by a single bullet?  If he misses the first enemy, and
then 
     misses exceptionally against the second, does he go back to the friendly
unit at 
     17m next?  Is there any risk to the friendly unit at 2m?  What does
danger space 
     have to do with any of this?  Can full autofire be used to make multiple
attacks 
     against a single target?  What about targets in the same line of fire,
but not 
     adjacent to each other?

Does anyone have a faq or flowchart for this?  Are there any products which
clarify these rules?

Argh!  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Now was this letter really signed A Friend, or did you just snip out the 
name. If this character doesn\'t have the courage to sign his own name, I 
think we can safely forget about this.

While what everyone said that even if this was for real, this guy probably 
wouldn\'t have a legal leg to stand on, it seems more likely to me that this 
is some kind of joke.

Here are a few suggestions, If he bothers you again, tell him you need
more information.  Firstly, when was the first public use of his word. 
It is not sufficient to coin a word for himself but he must also
demonstrate a use for it.  Secondly inform him that if indeed he ever
had a copiright, the word has fallen into mundane usage by simple
negligence on his part.  Lastly, tell him that if he ever dares attempt
to sue you for something that silly, you will make sure he will loose
everything (if I read his message carefully he might actually believe
the stuff he tells you and attempt to turn you into a frog... ribbit
ribbit ribbit...).

Finally, you might want to let him know that the US was not a signatory
to the Berne Convention in 1959.  Therefore, his copyright is no good in
Britain (I don\'t know if this is true, but your legal mumbo jumbo is as
good as his legal mumbo jumbo).

What I find truly amazing is that he might truly believe this stuff...

  Before we go off on tangents with a zillion different sub-skills
     for intel careers, how about this idea: 

     A _single_ skill (Intel; so named not to be confused with
     Intelligence characteristic), based on INT and EDU This skill
     allows gathering of various information together into an
     integrated picture, and permits prediction of future activity
     based on knowledge of past dispositions and behaviours. ......

You idea was very good and I like the douple use of skills to show 
that Intel people tend to be specialized in their knowledge.

This week\'s topic is "Game Handouts". Come talk about things you have given out as a GM, 
or received as a player, that helped make your game special;  
Imperial ID\'s, "aged" documents, etc. 

I\'ll be on IRC by 6:00PM Mountain Standard Time.  The following time 
zone equivalents apply:

             US Eastern :  9:00 PM 
             US Pacific :  6:00 PM 
             London     :  2:00 AM 
             Paris      :  3:00 AM

We have been trying to use the same server to help keep us from
getting lag.  We have had the best luck with:

             stlouis.mo.us.undernet.org       
             ports numbered:6660-6669 

If at first you don\'t get through, try again.  If you can\'t get on this
server, try another one that you have with your program, but make sure
that it has the \'.undernet.org\' suffix or you may not be able to find
us. Finally, as a last resort, if you have any troubles, eMail me. I 
will keep my email running and checking mail every 3 minutes.  I will 
be happy to try to help you land at the correct jump coordinates. 
My email address is:  suzd@goodnet.com


Here are a few places for you to look if you are new to IRC to help you 
get connected and join the live Traveller talk...
             
      http://www.undernet.org/ 
This is the Undernet homepage.  There are a number of helpful links here
that you might be interested in, including, the official server list for
the Undernet. (More on servers later.) 
  
      http://www2.axi.net/ 
This is the mIRC homepage.  mIRC is one of the most common IRC clients. 
Just like you need a web browser to view web pages, you use an IRC client
to chat on IRC.  This location includes downloads for the mIRC faq, an 
IRC faq, and the mIRC program itself.  It also includes a section titled 
"Instructions for Net Newbies & Download Dummies" that will help you on 
your way to IRC. 
    
     http://www.bcpl.lib.md.us/~frappa/pirch.html
This is another popular IRC client.  There are many links here to help 
you find your way to IRC as well. 

Now, once you have connected to your ISP and loaded your IRC client, you 
pick a server and a port and then connect to IRC.  After that, you join 
#traveller and commence talking to us. :) 

Sorry for the length.

In the RAF, yes, but not in the USAAF.  In the good old USAAF there was an
Officer sitting in both pilot\'s seats.

Anything larger than an armed row boat will have an Officer in command. <G>

In My Games...
A Gig or Ship\'s Boat might be commanded by an Ensign, but actually *run* by
a senior NCO.  Patrol Torpedo Boats (my version of
fighters) have Lt\'s (jg\'s and full Lt\'s) in command.  A *squadron* of PT
boats, and their tender, are commanded by a LtCmdr (at least). Corvettes
and Escorts have a LtCmdr (min) in command.  Destroyers and Frigates are a
good billet for a Cmdr.  Larger individual ships (Ship\'s of the Line) rate
a Captain.  Flag Officers, Admirals, command squadrons and fleets.
 
My Officer ranks:
- -- 
O1  Ensign            
O2  Lt, junior grade  
O3  Lt                
O4  Lt, senior grade

O7  Captain
O7A Fleet Captain (Honorary title for a Captain commanding a

My Flag ranks:

O8  Rear Admiral
O9  Admiral

Yes, but if they sue you and lose you can sue them for relief. That\'s how
lawyers get RICH!  <g>

Here\'s an interesting thought...which court would have legal
jurisdiction?  An English one, where the web site is physically located? 
An American one, where the plantif accessed the site and discovered that
you were alledged misappropriating their trademaked item.

BTW, I\'m not a lawyer either, so my comments on anything legal have no
weight...none at all!  <g>

stuff, and how we insist on sticking in "weasel words" in an attempt to

I don\'t get is

Well, don\'t hold us in suspense! What does it mean, or imply, in Oz?

BTW, while normally we Canucks prefer the term North American to American 
(don\'t like being lumped in with those yankees, eh), in the case of 
sitcoms, feel free to call them American. Let the US take the well-deserved 
blame for those.

(and as for the very few Canadian sitcoms, I think we as a country would 
rather disown them as well).

Hi! I started as MT referee recently, too. Now I\'ve changed to to T4.

He tells you, whom he wants to hit, doesn\'t he?

If he shoots ONE target and hits it, the others stay unharmed, of course, 
except he uses ammo with a danger space (i.e. grenades).

Depends on the ammo. If he uses ammo with dangerspace (=exploding or 
poisoning ...), it\'s fairly likely that there are more units affected.

There\'s a difference between missing and missing. If you shoot, and WILL 
miss, because you stumbled or didn\'t aim right or whatever (exceptional 
failure), then the bullet may as well hit a person standing in front of 
the target nearby. Of course the bullet won\'t come back and hit him !!

>Is there any risk to the friendly unit at 2m?

Depends on how you want it. He could be the most endangered at 
exceptional failure.

>What does

>      have to do with any of this?

See above.

>Can full autofire be used to make multiple
> attacks
>      against a single target?

Yes. (I did it like this, but you as a referee can handle this as you 
like)

>What about targets in the same line of fire,
> but not
>      adjacent to each other?

Hm? If I understand you right on this, you ask for targets, standing one 
behind the other. Well, the frontmost is the one, who will be aimed for.

Else, the player will tell you, whom he\'s aiming at.

One statement: YOU are the GOD in your game. Act like it!
Which means: stick to the rules only as long as you are comfortable with 
them.

Hope this helps.

Oh, dear, I seem to have generated a bit too much in the way of
response, there.  Sorry.

I think My Friend is probably a hoaxer, but if not he may well be a

Well, it turns out that from *low* orbit (Mercury, Gemini, Space
Shuttle, etc) you can actually see large animals on the ground! This
was scoffed at until later flights confirmed it. This is "see" in the
sense of seeing individual dots as a herd of elephants...

So ships might be visible at multi-thousand km ranges, but only as
points of light (if you know where to look, you can see a lot of
satellites in fairly distant orbits).

Seeing any sort of detail requires that they be fairly close.

Not bloody likely. For one thing, you can\'t *copyright* a *term*. You
can possibly trademark it, but that\'s iffy. And he\'d have lost the
trademark decades ago, as "Psionics" has been in common use in SF since
the 60s, if not the 40s or 50s.

> 3) Does copyright on things in the US effect its use by me in the UK?

Possibly. But again, he *cannot* have a copyright on a *word*.

Words can\'t be copyrighted. They can be trademarked, and his trademark
would have lapsed long ago for allowing the term to come into common use.

> These terms were not only
> Copyrighted by us, they were U.S. Trade and Service Marke by Mentor and
> myself.

It\'d pay to have someone check with the patent & trademark office. But
even if they somehow *did* get "Psionics" and "Psionics Institute" and
"Institute of Psionics" registered, it\'d take all of about 10 minutes
to get it thrown out simply by showing that the term was in common use
*before* they used it. And in fact, given the meaning of "psionics"
they *can\'t* trademark "Psionics Institute" or the like.

Politely point out to the man that the term has been in common use in
science fiction for 50 years, and has a quite different meaning.

If he brings in a lawyer, *then* worry. But only because he sounds like
the type that will fight a hopeless case.

On the other hand, since he\'d have to bring the suit under *trademark*
law, you can point out that he is *not* suing <insert long list of SF
authors>. And SFWA (Science Fiction Writers of America) might even want
to get involved simply to remove a potential nuisance to their members.

        Interesting..:).  OTOH, it could have our original prankster

        Traditionally, you sue in the jurisdiction where the defendant is
domiciled.  However, some U.S. state courts do have this tendency to
encourage forum-shopping (Texas is bad for this), and given the Internett=

nature of the alleged "violation" (ya right) and that nasty case where a
California BBS was prosecuted in Tennessee for a violation of Tennessee
obscenity-law violations, so in the U.S. this doesn\'t hold as much as it
used to.  Glenn M. Goffin can probably enlighten us further on this, as
he\'s a practicing U.S. attorney and I am not.

        That being said, an argument of forum non conveniens (exactly wha=

it sounds like) would probably work, assuming that A. Friend were for rea=

and not a pranking TMLer, and dumb enough to actually try to sue Jo.
Therefore, once Jo got it into a U.K. court, the first thing her solicito=

How about, if in australia if you asked a male to get his fanny

What I\'d love to do is write a *good* space simulator, with
multi-player networking capability. You could do campaigns in "real
time". After all, in most cases you could see ships coming hours or
days in advance. So "scheduling" battles for when folks had the free
time would be workable.=20

Design it to support Traveller-type ship design and then we don\'t
*need* combat rules. :-)

Good point!  If the system or area is a true backwater there may only be
enough ships to justify a Captain.  I would guess, though, that the
lightest weight you\'d see is a Captain for any area to speak of.  Remembe=

Well, OK.  There aren\'t many modern day (or Imperial British Navy) parall=
els
to Known Space in terms of scope, so this, IMHO, becomes a matter of opin=
ion.
 So, without further ado, IMHO, I don\'t think so.  Maybe a Commander (eve=
n a
Lt. Cmdr.) would be given command of a small or less strategically import=
ant
system, but, fleets would probably be given to nothing less than a Commod=
ore
(or Rear Admiral Lower Half, as the esteemed Jeff Zeitlin informs us.)  T=
his
would tend to make the Navy a little bloated in it\'s higher ranks, but,
promotions don\'t come all that often, don\'t you know (only once per term.=
)
 Further, I imagine a subsector being (very) roughly equivalent to a thea=
ter
of operations in WWII, and, so far as I know, nothing less than an Admira=
l
(in any variety of flavors) was given charge of a theater.  Also, I\'m not
sure that a Marine or Army General might not have command of military
operations in some subsectors, at least in times of war.   >>

I wasn\'t considering the other services. I agree that they could be used =
in=20
some cases, but the point is that the Navy is the most important - if you=
=20
control space, you control trade and the worlds themselves, and there\'s=20
bugger all the ground-pounders can do to stop you.

I do have a bit of canon to support my view - it\'s stated that when the R=
ule=20

I assume that in a rapidly-expanding Imperium, a similar situation would=20

oked (late=20
70s), it was a cruiser. How many of these are in the inventory?

2. Roughly how many of these missile boats are in the inventory?

3. I assume that these Aussie Navy patrol boats are armed with Exocets, H=
arpoons or=20
equivalent over-the-horizon fire-and-forget missiles and small AA guns. H=
owever, missile=20
baots vary wildly in size from the smallish Soviet _Osa_ (4 "Styx" missil=
es, small=20
autocannon) to pocket frigates. Where on this spectrum do the Aussie boat=
s lie?=20

Any information is appreciated ;)

 Also, Jo, how come your questions are nearly word-for-word

 Now, in this case, there _might_ have been a case at one time,
 because I do know that there was a real Traveller\'s Aid Society
 (and may still be) up in the Boston area.  However, there\'s a
 lot of years involved, and formica is generic (see several
 other posts in this thread collection).

 Under US law, which is closely parallel to international law on
 this issue, my layman\'s reading is that he doesn\'t have a leg

 (1) His usage of the term, regardless of how old it is, is not
 the same as has been used throughout science fiction for untold
 years.  Microsoft cannot prevent you from using the word
 "Windows" to refer to a collection of openings in your walls.

 (2) It\'s been lots of years, lots of books, lots of games.  A
 "Saltine" was originally a salted zwieback cracker from
 Nabisco. That doesn\'t stop a heck of a lot of companies from
 selling saltines with that name - and Nabisco, having done
 nothing for many years, now does nothing because they cannot.
 Ditto aspirin, a trade name for acetylsalicilic acid in tablet
 form.  Ditto formica, a trade name for an easy-to-clean
 laminate covering for counters.  Almost ditto Xerox and Kleenex
 - but those companies fought in time.

 My advice:  Let him buy a lawyer before you even consider
 dropping references to psionics in your Traveller-related web
 pages.

 Umm, not exactly, as I understand it.  The zampolit did not
 necessarily have rank or seniority in the traditional sense,
 but he was _never_ of _lower_ rank than the military CO.  They
 had different reporting chains, and the zampolit, by virtue of
 his "more important" chain of command, overrule the military
 CO.  The zampolit was also responsible for "morale
 conditioning" aboard ship.  You can get a very good feel for
 this in Clancy\'s "The Hunt for Red October".

 Nope. That\'s one of the things that they look for in appointing
 them.  If you push them too far, and they get fed up, they just
 need five words: "You\'re relieved.  I\'m in command." or their
 local semantic equivalent, and you are relieved.  Or else you
 had better be _very_ senior, and _very_ good at what you do.
 Or else have a good plan, like Capt. Ramius did in "Red
 October".

 Why not?  The extra cash is to compensate for the drawbacks -
 as an example, take an airline pilot who does international
 runs: If he is on a long-distance run, such as New York/JFK to
 Tokyo/Narita, aviation regulations and union contracts have
 basically forced him into maintaining two pieds--terre, one at
 each end of the run.

 Also, the cost of living at one end may be higher than
 "standard", plus he may have extraordinary expenses to maintain
 himself properly for the job (for example, uniforms are
 generally more expensive than non-uniform clothing that may
 look nearly indistinguishable.  As an example, I can get, in an
 ordinary clothing store, a pair of dark blue slacks, a pair of
 black shoes, a pair of black socks, and a white "military" cut
 shirt, for about $100-$150.  A police lieutenant from my
 department must purchase his uniforms from an authorized
 source, which will charge him about $300 for the "same" thing.
 Then, on top of that, he must purchase the insignia and sew
 them on himself.).

 Also, while aboard a ship in transit, he must be considered to
 be on duty 24hrs per day - which means that unless he gets
 _long_ layovers, he\'s probably racking up overtime.

 That\'s for the pilot on a regular run.  If he\'s on a "tramp",
 then he _has_ no real home - so there\'s got to be an inducement
 for him to give up the comforts of planetary life.  Cash
 generally works pretty well.

Well, 

There is a way but it is not very convenient. I use "Guns, Guns, Guns" from
BTRC to design weapons, it gives conversions for T4/MT/TNE(TW2000). You
would have to reverse engineer the MT weapons to arrive at a GGG Damage
Value once you have that you can convert to what ever you want. 

By the way BTRC has a new version available with T4 conversions included,
BTRC also has a Excel spreadsheet already made for use with "Guns, Guns,
Guns", and there is also a PDF version that can be downloaded for $$$.

I do not yet have the new version of GGG but will have it soon.

I find it easier to just design new weapons for T4.

Here is an example weapon for T4

Tech Level 15 10mm Autopistol using binary propellants

Lenght   Weight in Kg          Costs                         Magazine

space station or another ship. I\'ve had a fair amount of experience trying to do
just that from the ground and can provide some details if anyone\'s interested. 

There is a difference between detecting an object and resolving it. Many people
have seen the shuttle or MIR passing overhead at twilight. Their ranges are on
the order of a few hundred kilometers. If the target has flashing lights like
aircraft strobes, it can also be seen at a few hundred kilometers naked eye when
it is in the dark 

Under special conditions, the naked eye detection ranges can be much greater.
Glints from the solar cell panels a few square meters in size on geosynchronous
satellites 40,000 some kilometers away, for example, can be naked eye visible
under the right conditions (3rd magnitude or brighter if you\'re into astronomy).
The real trick in detecting objects at these ranges is knowing where to look.
There are several web pages that provide information on observing satellites if
you\'re interested in trying.

Being able to pick out any structure with the naked eye would require shorter
ranges or some optics. The shuttle and Mir are visible as moving points of light
to the naked eye, but a moderate (50 cm) aperture telescope can resolve some
structure. Larger telescopes can pick out quite a bit of detail, even through
the atmosphere. Something like the Star Trek "magnify" command for a viewscreen
tied to external telescopes on a starship (especially with some advanced optical
processing) should allow "visual" operations at ranges of at least five hundred
kilometers as long as the target is sunlit. Low power lasers could allow
operations in the dark, but might be misunderstood. Even with our current
technology, some information on gross size and shape can be obtained at greater
ranges.

Without optical assistance, I agree the ranges to be able to see any structure
on a large object would be on the order of a few kilometers. You can only
recognize the largest objects looking down from an airliner at around 30,000
feet altitude.

"Fanny" in Britain (and apparently Australia as well) refers to the

Thus "sitting on your fanny" conjures up a *very* strange image.

The escape velocity tets is correct (give or take the math - I didn\'t
check it) but applies in two stages:

1) when the rocky core of the planet forms, and the gas
condenses. This is one the astronomers thought they were confident
about, but it now seems large cores can form fast enough to bind
hydrogen while the star-cloud is still condensing and not properly
heating the forming planets;

2) after formation (and binding gas), when the dust and unbound gas
has been stripped away and the star is shining properly. The planets
we\'re talking about will then have a ferocious temperature, but also,
due to their immense size, a huge escape velocity.

We have to remember that the mass of the accumulated gas can itself be
enough to bind hydrogen at the later, high temperature, even if the
rocky core alone cannot bind the gas at the high temp.


The interesting point for Trav is that these Giant planets exist at all...
The rules all place Jovian type planets out in the equivalent zone to
our system\'s gas giants.... but the first sample of foreign stars we
observe doesn\'t place them there.
Given the small sample tested so far, we must conclude that hot
supergiant planets are in fact quite common (or we\'d not have spotted
them in our sample.) OK - the sampling method is biassed \'cos it only
detects huge lumps close to stars - but they found so many to imply
lots more.

This does mean that we are much more likely to find gas-giants in the
"habitable zone" than previously figured... Whether they will have as
many moons if they form in close to a star I don\'t know...

In MT, weapons have a penetration value which is identical (I believe)
to that used by Striker. A while back, I posted a conversion table
between Striker (or MT) penetration and T4 damage. Here it is again. I hope
it helps.

This article was written by Tim Peter with significant development ideas

The Intel skill was created by Michael Barry and developed further by Tim

New Skill Definition 

Intel (Default)      Int 
[Designed by Michael Barry, additional development by Tim Peter]
This skill is used to collate diverse datum to produce an analysis of a
subject\'s disposition and behavior, and permits prediction of future activity
based on said analysis.  For Intel to be used data must be available to the
analyst (must already have been gathered) and the analyst must have skills
related to information being analysed.  For example, if the character wishes
to analyze fleet movements along the border and predict the most likely time
and place of an enemy attack, the PC must possess both Intel and Tactics.
 The character would roll against each skill independently, with outcomes
determined as follows:
     
     Success vs. Tactics, Failure vs. Intel = Proper data interpretation,
        incorrect prediction of likely course of action.
     Failure vs. Tactics, Success vs. Intel = Poor data interpretation,
          good prediction based on flawed assumptions. (see Bay of Pigs)
     Success vs. Tactics, Critical Failure Vs. Intel = Proper data
               interpretation, disastrous tactical decision.

Bear in mind all Intel tasks are Uncertain tasks, as data may be out of date,
or incorrectly gathered (e.g., faulty sensor logs.)  Assume Spectacular
success against Intel allows PC to recognize likely validity of data.  

Other skills Intel may be paired with include(but are not limited to):
 Intel + Recon - analysis of close recon and tracking data 
 Intel + Criminology - analysis of criminal activity
 Intel + Computer + Tactics - to create a computer model that simulates 
  enemy behavior in a given tactical situation. 

Difficulty levels are as follows:

     Basic information about adversary (eg typical weaponry, equipment, 
     racial characteristics): 2D 
     Detailed information about adversary: (common tactical responses to 
     combat situations): 3D 
     Close analysis of adversary dispositions: (likely positions of enemy 
     based on partial data) 3.5D
     Deep analysis of adversary: (analysis of commander\'s objectives and 
     means used to achieve those objectives): 4D

Difficulty modifiers may include the amount of data available, how recently
the data was collected, and how many people are helping in the analysis.  For
multiple analysts to review the data at least one must have the Leadership

    'body' => '     I was looking through some old White Dwarfs last night, and I came 
     across some interesting Traveller articles (as well as some good 
     reminiscing - reviews of C&S, Call of Cthulhu, Bushido, Space Opera, 
     Traveller deluxe set, Starfleet Battles, rumours of Chaosium licensing 
     AH to produce RQ, rumours of TSR about to sue someone [some things 
     never change...]).
     
     One of the articles, by Andy Slack (who did a lot of Traveller stuff 
     for WD - I wonder what ever happened to him?), concerned fleet 
     composition.  He argued that for design simplicity, and so that the 
     ships didn\'t completely dwarf anything the PCs might have, it would be 
     a good idea to build up fleets purely using Book 2 designs (or rather 
     ships that could be designed using Book 2).  His suggestion for a 
     fleet composition went as follows:
     
     1    Carrier with about 100 fighters
     2-12 Escorts (type C or T - I think that\'s Close Escort & Patrol 
          Cruiser)
     1-6  Auxiliaries - supply ships, hospital ships, etc (type R / M 
          subsidised merchants)
     3-18 Scouts (type S)
     1-6  Couriers - for inter-fleet comms
     1-6  Tankers
     1-6  Assault Carriers
     
     The scouts would, er, scout, the carrier, tankers & auxiliaries would 
     huddle under the protection of the escorts and the fighters would go 
     in and do the fighting.
     
     
     I have to admit I rather liked the idea of this mix of smaller ships 
     in a fleet, rather than a BatRon made up of X 100,000 ton Battleships. 
      I guess that this fleet is too underpowered to take on an Imperial 
     squadron, but it could well be the task force for a pocket empire (in 
     fact the article was written around 1983...).

another way to dispatch the poor souls.

I know! I will drop relativistic rocks on them!  Virus infected

Given past usages, it\'d be HIMS (His Imperial Majesty\'s Ship). But I
believe it\'s already established as INS (Imperial Navy Ship) or INV
(Imperial Navy Vessel).

There\'s also ISS (Imperial Scout Ship).

Actually, on a combat vessel, you are likely going to design the ship
with the reactor at one "end" so you can cut mass by using shadow
shielding. So then you just armor the reactor enough to keep it from
getting knocked out too easily, and just incorporate some extra armor
in the shield between the reactor and the crewed sections of the ship.

That makes it very difficult to have reactor damage present a risk to
the crew, other than the usual "Oh shit, there goes the power!".

Of course there will be some promotions and posthumous decorations in
the engineering department if they have to repair the reactor to get
home.

You\'ve also overlooked tonal languages like Chinese where the same word
has many different meaning depending on which tone or tones are used in
speaking it. 

And of course there are things like some african languages with such
phonetic elements as "inhaled clicks". The current record holder for
the worst tongue twister is in one of those languages (check a copy of
Guiness). It has three or four inhaled clicks and sounds like the
speaker is swallowing her tonsils sideways! (I used to know a lady who
could say it...)

Again, note Chinese. Many of the dialects are completely unintelligible
to each other, yet they all use the same ideograms. So they can
communicate in writing, but not speak to each other. Heck, the Japanese
can still read a good deal of Chinese!

None of them. But I\'m not equipped to enter the ideogram, even if I
knew it. :-)

Well, there *is* a limit on the spread of English in that situation.
Islam. While they tolerate translation of the Koran, to be a true
Muslim, you have to read it in the original Arabic. That sets a *hard*
limit on penetration of any other language, at least as long as the
religion endures.

   That\'s because they spend their time fighting relatively close to shore,
or at least that\'s the theory anyway (Khe Sanh didn\'t have much beach
front from what I understand....).  They do have logistics units, but as
you suggest there are fewer of them proportionately than their Army
counterparts.

>This doesn\'t mean Marines are more "elite", just that they have a

   Don\'t tell a Marine that (especially one from the U.S.).  As far as they
are concerned, they are by definition ``an elite fighting force``, the equal
in the U.S. of an Army Ranger (my standing in the Army Reserve
disqualifies me from commenting on this remark--other than to cough
politely....and sarcastically).

   In point of fact, services around the world do consider the U.S.
Marine infantry to be a cut above your standard Army infantry, on a par
with the elite 82nd or 101st Airborne divisions of the U.S. Army.  Their
armor units are lacking however (most of them still have M-60A3 tanks,
and what M-A1s they have were stolen/requisitioned from the Army),
and their artillery support relies heavily on supplementation from the Navy
in the form of off-shore bombardment, and their own aircraft (the Harrier,
F/A-18, SuperCobra, etc.).

   In TRAVELLER terms (because I know sombody is going to complain
if I don\'t), Marines could have a variety of roles, depending upon the
basic philosophy of the armed forces using them.  

   The Imperium used its Marines as ship\'s troops and as kind of a SWAT
team/peace keeping force, called out when the locals started getting a
little too violent with each other.   Imperial Marines are elite--in the same
manner that U.S. Marines are.  They strike with overwhelming force,
secure the objectives, and then move on when so ordered.  Their tactics
emphasize mobility and shock over battles of attrition.  While Marine
garrisons are set up on a long term basis (like the one on Terra), such
garrisons serve merely as bases of operations or are for show--in
general Marine units do not spend too much time in one place, long
term occupation duties usually going to the Army.

   For my own campaigns, Marines are used as offensive troops--the
people who get to invade planets--the Army is used to defend planets
from invasion.  While a Marine force may find itself having to defend
against a counterattack, in general they are relieved by Army forces as
soon as is practical.  As with the Imperial Marines, the Marines in my
campaigns emphasize mobility, though they are better able to handle
prolonged campaigns if necessary.

Harold

Isn\'t this why they call those guys up in Washington politicians?  I thought

See my post of Quotes from Survival Margin!  Virus can only inflitrate
through sensors with GREAT (read great, big, huge, stupendous) difficulties,
and it was NEVER done!  Also, I\'m at work now, so I don\'t have SM with me
(its in my concrete safe surrounded by asbestos in the bomb shelter under my

transponders.  I know if I ran a big investment company, I\'d want a

So you might get a situation akin to Sanskrit in India, used only for 
religious purposes and scholarly efforts, or to Latin in the pre-Vatican-
II Catholic church.  One language for secular purposes, one for religious.
(Actually, a medieval-style church based on Vilani scripture amidst an
otherwise mid-tech world might be an interesting adventure locale....)

I wonder if perhaps it might be better understood if we explained the 
entities known as virus as a wondering CPU/SYSTEM ENGINEER/USER all 
rolled into one.  A CPU because it is capable of executing computer code, 
a SYSTEM\'S ENGINEER because it is capable of re-designing the circutry 
pathways to best suit it\'s own needs and a USER because it is capable of 
independently executing any commands that it see\'s fit.

  Well...if you are willing to include unpaid \'lend/lease\'

Great Britain, and France.  Probably some others as well.

  HEY!  MY PLAYERS RESEMBLE THAT REMARK!  
I like it!

Fission reactors are over engineered to a serious degree.  As several
people have pointed out, the human factor is the greatest safety 
threat.  Ways to offset it include:
1.  Keeping an *certified* engineer on board, even if the rules say you
        don\'t need one to operate the ship.  Local regs require it.
2.  Annual mainatance includes an expensive & extensive safety check of 
        the fission reactor.
3.  Higher port fees for ships with fission reactors and/or HEPlaR drives.
        To offset safety procedures and all that...

In my campaigns, several abbreviations were used, depending on the service.
The Navy used INS meaning "Imperial Naval Ship"; for example, INS Kinunir.
Navy ships were also numbered (but the numbers were not ordinarily used).
Navy numbers consist of the ship\'s type letters (BB for battleship, for
example), and a hull number (all ships of the same class had sequential
numbers in a given range; other classes - even of the same type - had
different ranges).  Therefore, BB-705 Vland was one of the Sylea-class
dreadnoughts, all numbered in the 700 series (700 to 765), while the BB-4363
"Panther" was one of the Tigress-class battleships in the 4000 series.

The named ships of the scout service used IISS meaning "Imperial Interstellar
Scout Ship"; for example, IISS Sparkling Distress.  In my campaigns, the
scout service didn\'t name it\'s small ships; these were numbered (with a
class letter and a not-quite-random number) and not officially
named (although many crews decorated their craft with nose art and
unofficial names); for example S3253 would be an "S" class scout/courier;
X452 was an "X" class express boat (called "Misha" by her pilot).  The scout
service numbered it\'s ships consecutively, in the order that the
construction contracts were let (since this did not always mean the ships
were completed at all, let alone in the same order, there are gaps in the
sequences).

Civilian ships (vessels 100 tons and larger) could use SS, meaning either
"Star Ship" or "Space Ship" (for large non-starships), but such use was
considered archaic or "colonial".  To their crews, passengers, and most
other people, the ships were known only by their name (for example:
"Beowulf") or more formally by their class and name ("Free Trader Beowulf").

Officially (and that usually meant only to customs inspectors and the bank
that held the mortgage on the ship), all civilian ships, including
small craft, where known by their registry number.  Like the numbers used by
the Navy (and the civilian ship registry program was originally started by
the Navy), this consisted of a more-or-less random hull number, and
the class letters.  For example, A-4234363 might be the free trader "Wayward
Dream", and A2-572342 would be far trader "Long Shot".

Of course, there is no reason to doubt that the Imperium developed
other devices using Deyo chips.  For example, a Deyo chip would make a
perfect facilitator in an encryption/decryption device (complete with
a government backdoor, if you like).  It\'s not much of a leap to
envision these devices being connected to a multitude of systems:
Banking, Government, Corporate and anything else that requires
security/encryption.

And I think spaceports would have transponders (at least the orbital
part), by the way.  So would satellites and anything else permanently
in orbit.  Afterall, when you pop into a system it\'s important to know
which sensor echo to set a course towards....or stay away from.

>I\'ve never had a problem with Virus infecting ships through passive 
sensors.  Let\'s face it all Passive EMS is is a giant ear picking up 
every piece of electromagnetic information in your area, from stellar 
data, to gas giant radio emissions, from old Jack Benny programs to 
Virus.  To a Passive EMS array it\'s all electo-magnetic information that 
must be processed then handed off to the sensor suite.  This sensor suite 
data is then routed through the main computer so anyone from the guy in 
laser turret A to the captian can access that information and see what\'s 
out there.

Active sensor\'s I have much more of a problem with them becoming 
infected, but lets face it it is possible.  Active sensors send out a 
pulse of energy, (One Ping, Mister Zhdanov.) now if this was all active 
sensors did it\'d be impossible to infect via them.  However, like passive 
sensors active sensors have a receiver array, that big pulse of energy is 
useless unless you have someway of receiving and processing return 
echo\'s.  Now the EMS Active system would be programmed to receive only 
return echo\'s at a certian wave length, what ever the out going pulse is 
set to.  Assuming that you can determine the wave length of that pulse, 
which considering the amount of energy that\'s flying around will be 
fairly easy you could in theory piggyback the Virus on the return echo 
which has to be recieved and processed by the ship.

Now I realize active sensors are not designed to interpret data, but that 
doesn\'t matter, the virus, already in the active processing buffer merely 
digs it\'s little hidey hole in the circutry and develops.  Now I\'m not 
saying that this is going to happen regularly.  Hell lets face it it\'s 
probably going to be the most rare of all virus transfers.  However in 
the case where none of the easy access ports are available, Transponder, 
Radio or Passive Sensors in that order.  Active Sensors could be used as 
a method of infection.

Given that you assume the basic the nature of Virus as presented 
in Survival Margin to be true, "silicon lifeform able to parasitize chips 
at a distance, blah blah blah yakity shmakity..." is this not a 
possibility?

Quite possible, though I don\'t recall one way or another.  In any case, I 
thought it best to clarify matters, as if you did go on to say that, it 
must\'ve looked a bit contradictory. :)

And that\'s precisely my point -- there is *no* difference in scale between
BL and BR.  Each uses 30 minute time units, 30,000 km space units, and one
counter = one ship.  There is a difference in *detail level* between the
two systems, but not of scale.

There\'s no need to ask forgiveness, btw.  This list is all about learning,
exploration, and mutual support of a hobby we all enjoy.  There\'s no
reason at all for issues of guilt or blame to come up.

	All right, all right...I have: (left to right)

A fluorescent pink rat, a somewhat battered plastic T-rex holding 
some sort of cannon looking thing,  a small chunk of fossilized 
turtle dung, a dimetrodon, and an Alien (from the Aliens movie) 
grappling with a legless small action figure, provenance unknown.

I ride my bike in to work; kids throw the strangest things out of
car windows out into the streets. Each of these is a found item,
except for the turtle dung...I got that at the big Gem and Mineral
show here in Tucson a couple of years back. That\'s there so that
when some smartass asks me how\'s it going, when I\'m busy I just hand
it to \'em and say \'Same old sh*t!\' Since it looks like considerably
*less* fossilized than it actually is, it henerally gets quite a
reaction.

oB TRaveller: Any of you from around Tucson know what it\'s like, but 
the annual Gem and Mineral Show(s) here in February is the largest of 
it\'s kind in the world. Dealers in anything geological related, gems, 
mineral specimens, fossil dealers (a couple of years ago, one big 
dealer set up a complete mastodon fossil in the entrance to the hotel 
where they were showing their stuff....had I a spare 75 grand lying 
around, I\'d have a hell of a entranceway!), jewelry, both finished 
and supplies, mining equipment, and on and on.  People start arriving 
in mid-january, and all the motels along the interstate are full of 
people selling all sorts of stuff.

	Some estimates of the amount of money that changes hands run int the 
hundreds of millions. I have seen big suitcases stuffed with cut 
gemstones, worth millions.

	All these people arrive in planes, in beat up cars, in U-Haul 
trucks, etc. Something like this would be a fabulous place for PC\'s 
to find adventure and patrons...with a little imagination almost any 
scenario could be set up, security, kidnapping, theft, swindles, and 
the prevention of the same, lost Ancient artifacts, holy relics.

	Imagine being asked to handle 75 tons of delicate fossil remains. Or 
a crate full of beautiful radioactive crystals.  Or a cargo of 
(unbeknownst to the PC\'s) fake gemstones, being sent out as bait to 
distract attention from the real shipment.  He He He.

There\'s a shipping problem for you!

	Hmmm...I think I\'ll pop over and get JTAS submission guidelines ;)

the quoting is needed; I spend 1-2 hours a day reading e-mail. I need

You guys kept trying to argue that it was the CCG market that was stealing

Very true, but was any mention made as to whether the legionaires were
already familiar with the course when the record was set?

Where do you live in Tucson?  I lived there for about a year several 
years ago.  I\'m now back in Phoenix...

Damn you, Joe!  I can\'t add *anything* to this thread  8-)

I got one for you.  It\'s based on the old AD&D statistic generation
methods.  If memory serves me correctly (and it\'s been many years), I
believe they had two additional ways to generate the 3-18 result for each
stat besides the normal 3d6 roll (there was a third method that involved
rolling a certain number of dice and adding a fixed amount, and then
distributing them as the player saw fit, but that method might be too
difficult to calculate).  They were:

...2d6+6

...4d6 (ignore the lowest die result)

Now... which one of these methods will mathmatically produce the better
(ie: higher) result?  The gauntlet has been dropped  8-)

Ok... then perhaps I can pry this information out of you guys in a
different way.  I own a copy of Fighting Ships for MT but don\'t actually
own the game.  In it battleships and riders have armour 90-120, cruisers...
57-100, and escorts... 40-60.  How do these values rate compared to CT or
TNE armour values?  In HG, too much armour could make a ship virtually
invincible.  I\'m clueless to what is a formidable armour rating in TNE
(without going overboard).

BTW, who is "Jesse Helms"?  Any relation to Uncle Jesse from Dukes of
Hazzard?

I was on their web site yesterday, and it does look very interesting.
There wasn\'t any indication that you could draw ship deckplans though,
and that\'s what I was looking for.  But you say you can?  That\'s
great!  Does it have the option of placing a hex or square grid behind
the maps/plans?  I didn\'t see that either.  What about objects to
populate a ship..does it have any placeable objects?

Please do.  I\'d like to take a look.

But just imagine that guy as a Patron, or better yet, an NPC taking

Y\'know, it just occured to me that booby trapping those transponders
was a violation of Imperial law! Remember, those chips are *sentient*
lifeforms! So frying them is murder. 

There are ways around this, but they get rather weird and convoluted.

It\'s possible to make them a lot more idiot proof. Plus, people are a
lot less likely to take shortcuts if it\'s their pink bod at stake.
Pilots tend to take a lot better care of their plane than Joe average
does of his car.

Aside from the contamination problem (which can be handled fairly
easily if not cheaply), the danger due to the fission reactor is pretty
damn low. There\'s a far greater danger simply from the kinetic energy
of a ship.

The only things that can go wrong (outside of deliberate sabotage)
during takeoff or landing are loss of power, or being unable to shut
down. 

Loss of power is much the same danger with any ship. It\'s just that the
pieces will be radioactive. (Actually, given what we know about fusion,
they\'ll only be *more* radioactive, fusion reactions give off neutrons,
and the inside of the reactor does get radioactive).

If you can\'t get the reactor to shut down (actually "reduce power")
then you cut the fuel supply, and deal with it in when the manuever is
completed. It\'s not gonna melt down any time soon. 

The reactor is no more dangerous than a cargo of radioactives, or
various toxic materials. Hell, if there\'s a railroad running thru your
town, go down and look at a freight train sometime. Try and make note
of what all those tank cars are carrying. Then look the chemicals up
and figure out what happens if there\'s a wreck and some of them break
open.

Ah, but you have to admit that the New Jersey is a fair trade for one
*hell* of a lot of regular artillery. :-)

I\'m trying to remember the three types of Marines in Pournelle\'s
Co-Dominium series. Garrison, Line, and Fleet (I think).

The Garrison Marines basicly did garrison duty. They occupied
territory, but down riots, that sort of thing. Cobat skills so/so, but
they definitely look pretty, and they follow orders.

Line Marines were the folks that you sent in to take territory away
from people they aren\'t much on spit and polish, but they fight. Oh do
they fight. They follow orders, but only because the orders come from
*their* officers. (They seem to have inherited a lot from the Foreign
Legion, including the bit about "You have joined the Marines to die.
The Fleet will send you where you can die")

Fleet marines spent most of their time on shipboard....

Well, unlike the Catholic church\'s use of Latin, in Islam the
*people* have to read the scriptures. No idea how this compares with
the Indian situation.
