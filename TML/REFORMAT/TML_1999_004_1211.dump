        Well, the two guys in the back are obviously *completely*
destabilized....  the red player on the right facially looks surprised to be
playing...  "<snore> >SLAM!<  Eh?  Wha?  How the hell did I wind up >WHAM!<
..face first against the wall of a grav ball court? <whimper>"
        
        You mentioned in mail that the idea was to make the two red players
look like they had been shoulder/ checked out of the way...  Ok, but "comic
book" it...  rotate the red player on the left to face inwards, and bring
him forwards towards the blue player so it looks like the hit was more
recent...  The guy on the right...  he just looks so *lost*...  not sure how
to fix him.

        Maybe make him look like he is in pursuit of the blue team player...
They all ought to be wearing goggles and soccer-goalie-style fingerless
gloves...  Make the facial expression on the blue team player to communicate
aggression...  "You better be jumpin\' aside, son, or you\'ll be in pain when
I\'m done..."  ...  right now he looks like he\'s terrified...  "Omigod...  if
I even *touch* that thing they\'ll cream me!"....

        Just the humble opinions from the guy who played on the winning team
at the Denebian Freestyle Open Invitational...  Hmmm, better get my black
Raybans on...

From a naval historian\'s standpoint, that\'s a coke-on-the-keyboard

Later variants that don\'t cap armour and handle it in the weird way HG 
does make a "battlecruiser" concept more viable, since large ships are
often trading armour and speed; I suspect that an evolved FFS1/FFS2

a battlecruiser niche (6G but less armour), but I\'m not sure the IN

I\'ve found that at TL12 you *do* have to trade armor for speed - or at least
agility. Power plants take up so much room that high agility plus an
energy-hog weapon will run you out of hull space before you hang the
armor plates on it.

As tech levels rise, this becomes less and less of a problem - at TL 14+
or so, the max armor max agility battleship is less of a problem. Thus,
as it should be, increases in tech level lead to serious changes in
ship design philosophies. Unless, of course, a hidebound naval
leadership kept building ship classes the old way because it was
familiar, whether or not new technical opportunities made these older
design ideas efficient or not.

Why not use a "patent" model?  After filing a survey/planting a claim beacon the
owners have a period in which to file a full survey (1 year, 2 years , whatever
- -- depends upon raising capital).  Rules for a full survey are well defined (eh.
well, more on this later).

If you file the survey, you have a specified period in which to initiate
colonization.   If you colonize, you have specified rights (landing fees,
whatever) which can be used to establish income.  You may also license
additional rights from the UN -- which is, after all, a government, and so
probably will consider itself to have the "real" ownership of the property in
question.

The real model is that the explorers come home, file a claim, and then find a
big corporation to sell it to at a marginal profit.  (Look at Babylon 5 --
Planetary Explorations closed in on the easy wins, but there were independents
who took bigger risks, but had someone to sell the results to)

Why?  Lawyers.  Government defined rights mean that the big corporations can
squeeze in and "examine" your claim, and get some judge to find out that your
claim is "defaulted".

OTOH, you will also have claim jumpers, squatters, and all manner of rif-raf
trying to get in and get the goods on your world.

My understanding of the basic rules of traveller economics is that the players
will always be "on the edge" and "just scraping by" -- with just enough chance
of success to keep them trying for the next big one.

So the main result for "smart" players will be selling the discovery rights to a
major corporation, including a contract on the survey.  For "stubborn" players
(is there another kind) we get a squeeze at home, claim jumpers in the field, a
dim hope of ill defined payoff, maybe a few bucks in backing from a fringe group
that wants a world to settle on, and hey ---- we got an adventure.

My thought for your Mileau, Michel, for what it is worth.

I agree with the idea of dreanoughts being multi-role battleships,
so a dreadnought battlecruiser should be J6, 6G, meson T, lots of
lasers and missiles, fully streamlined, fuel scoops, fighters,
assault battalions, cargo. Oh, and some armour if it fits.

Phil Kitching
>>>>
Hold on a moment here!
The whole Dreadnought concept was a streamlining of roles and weapons
systems.  Prior to the ship called HMS Dreadnought, battleships had a
wide variety of weaponry of various sizes, as well as dozens of roles
they were supposed to play.  This made spotting the fall of shot
difficult and made for supply problems and such.  The beauty of the
Dreadnought concept is that it had one size of big guns, one size of
medium guns, and no other significant guns (significant in the sense of
shoot at another ship).  It was not cluttered with a dozen different
things it was supposed to do.  It had two roles, one being to destroy
enemy ships, and the other being to threaten to destroy enemy ships (the
second role is for "peace time" of course).  HMS Dreadnought was a truly
revolutionary design rather than evolutionary.
In keeping with this tradition, Traveller Dreadnought class ships would
NOT have large marine detachments (some for internal security of
course), would NOT have large fighter groups (some shuttles and small
craft of course, and perhaps a few fighters for picket duty, but
probably not fighters at all).  Traveller Dreadnoughts WOULD have
massive armor (as much as you can put on a non-asteroid ship of the TL),
6g, 6 agility, Jump-4, the biggest spinal mount you can get at the tech
level (two or three if using FF&S), a fair number of 100dT bay weapons,
and probably a smattering of laser turret batteries (for anti-missile
work).
Dreadnoughts are pretty much combat only ships.  Battleships on the
other hand would likely have a bit of everything, and thus might be a
bit bigger, but definitely not any more capable in combat than a
Dreadnought.  If the Battleship was not larger than the Dreadnought, it
would probably not be quite a match for the Dreadnought (close but no
cigar - as the saying goes).
Ok, this started out a bit in flame mode, but perhaps some more
discussion of the roles is appropriate.

You seem to have misunderstood what I am suggesting.  I am not
suggesting democracy as the one and only answer to the current state of
the Imperium.  In fact, because of the communication delays inherent in
the governance of an interstellar political grouping democracy is one of
the least effective ways of governance for the Imperium.

The most invasive activity I am suggesting the Imperium do on
individual planets is to be more strict in enforcing the extrality zones
of starports.  Specifically, if a sophont comes into the starport, they
need to be immune from extradition as long as they have not committed an
Imperial crime.  This is what I mean by the right to vote with one\'s
feet.  Where reasoned persuasion come in is to convince planetary
governments not to restrict access to and from the starpot extrality
zone.

Hmm...Vargr...Standard figure, set the head not-visible, add a dog from the

The digitgrade feet could probably be done the same way, bit more a pest to

Nope, that\'s a Covenant ship. The Aurora is a big Space 1999 Eagle :-)

Actually, it doesn\'t look like an Eagle, but it has the same modular

One of the Brittish computer arts magazines (in fact I think it was
Computer Arts) had Poser 1 as a free give away on their attached disk.
I\'ll see if I can\'t dig out which issue since I think the had it posted
on their web site as well. It\'s nowhere near as powerful as Poser 3 but
kind of neat to play with for the price. Not to mention the magazine is
great all by itself.

    I vote for the older version, but only because I see Ditzie as about 16
at some times & yet I can also see her at 8 at others.  Could she be a clone

	I think that an expolration charter that would require the things you listed
would be good.  The explorer would then have to register the planet with the
UN "Land Office" or some such body.   I would then let the explorer have "full
settlement rights" to the planet which he could then do with what he would.
Usually this would involve selling to the highest bidder for whatever sum he
could get.   The UN general laws would still apply so the right-holder of the
planet could not do anything an earth-based nation could not (presumably no
slavery, cannabalistic-god cult etc).
	You may also impose settlement restrictions  to prevent "rich exploiters"
from outbidding everyone on all the good planets.  The government might
exclude a high bid, force the explorer to take a lower bid from a more
politically correct bidder, and if the government were at all just, compensate
the explorer for the difference between the high bid and accepted bid, but
don\'t hold your breath.   
	To prevent the rise of a "noble land-owning class"  the settlement charter
might also  have a time frame/homestead provision.  The person with the
settlement charter (original or puchased)  will have exlusive right to settle
the planet for a period of time after the claim registration (at least ten
years, no more than 50) and gains full permanent ownership of all land on the
planet that he has actually developed at the end of the charter--at which time
an elected local government takes over the administration of all undeveloped
land. The ownership provisions extend to anyone who buys a segment of land
from the charter holder.  There might be provisions for a direct UN take over
of public land if the population is too small or "politically incorrect".
	Finally, the UN armed forces have the right to seize any discovered but
unsettled world for "security reasons".  You may or may not have rules for a
"fair market value" payment being made to the charter holder, or perhaps not,
depending on how you view your government\'s respect for property rights.

And this was the source for the "ballpark" figures I used in my post (which
I meant to disclaim; I did no real number crunching).

As has been implied or outright mentioned, the beanstalk doesn\'t go
"Straight up" from the surface, but is connected to a ballasting asteroid
or planetoid which is racing ahead of the point where the tether comes
down.

I also forgot to mention (and forgot!) that a beanstalk must be tethered at
the equator.  Think of Africa\'s economy after this was built.

Bruce has a valid point about the cheap reactionless thrusters making the
beanstalk economically ridiculous.  I can only handwave frantically around
this by saying that perhaps some planets have dangerous atmospheres, or
perhaps don\'t want the sound and air pollution associated with a lot of
ship traffic (cough), or maybe they want to collect big landing fees if the
ships avoid the up port (cough cough, *choke*, cough) {Excuse me} or
perhaps (cough) they have a personal taboo against not touching their own
planet (hack) but (choke) can do so through a surrogate (cough)
and...sorry, I\'m choking on this handwave...gotta go (collapse in a fit).

Yes, I suppose so....   I had expected more because it was Sue Dollar who
pointed me at this list in the first place.

Ah, bite me. I was down at Fort Halstead just the other day, and I can
assure you that insensitivity of munitions to attack isn\'t a big deal.
It\'s a standard test that anything we are buying or making has to pass.
I can\'t recall the last time something was rejected from our procurement
system for failing it.

True on one hand, yet if you had contragrav, you could get the same effect
by simply mandating that all cargo must be offloaded at the high port, and
only customs-run shuttles may transport cargo to the surface (for a fee
naturally!). It seems there would be no difference in the effort required
to offload a cargo, search it, and then load it onto a beanstalk capsule,
compared with the same procedure followed by loading it into a shuttle.

So anything in the atmosphere is either government (presumably with a
transmitter to prove it) or an illegal/hostile (shoot to kill).

Naturally, it seems obvious that this would be inconvenient for shipping
and may affect the attractiveness of your world for trade.

YMMV.

Excellent idea!

<major snip>

Now, let\'s say you have competing governments in the area.  You
could very well have rival claims not only by groups within one
government, but groups among several governments.  Working this sort
of thing out would be a nautral for diplomats...*and* gunboats.  And
PC\'s mixed into the middle of it all. ;->

Think everything needed to outfit a sizable battleforce.  As such it would
have to be well defended.  I\'d guess the a lot of thier locataions are
carefully guardes secrets.

He also didn\'t mention the price of <gulp> upgrades.  One of these days I
need to get upgrades for Poser, Bryce, Photoshop, Infini-D and a couple
others.  Need to look into Infini-D one of these days and see what they\'ve
added to it.

But doesn\'t one of the TNE books mention a secret Depot?  Hmmm, on the
otherhand, I think we\'re talking about to different classes and I was
thinking of a lot smaller one, although I did vagely remember reading about
the Depot\'s you\'re talking about.

Generally i like it. The import/export functions are quite robust; the
plug-ins are relatively stable; i\'ve yet been unable to do something i
wanted to.

My two favourite features are the ability to have a 2D map and 3D mapped
model windows open at the same time and any modification in one
automatically applied to the other, and the ability to set brushes to
effect multiple channels simultaneously.

All in all it\'s powerful software for the price, especially in a package deal.

 While I\'ve seen the new ones, I also liked the teen-aged one, and my browser

  The HBC would have had exclusive trading rights within the North-West -
the British Crown never claimed to own the land, I suspect. Certainly
monopoly trading companies were very popular with early modern European
governments, not least because they brought private capital into service
of State interests (which was a two-way street...).

  For most of the period Crown land would likely simply have been land
that wasn\'t held as private property (ignoring aboriginals here); IIRC,
nowadays Crown land is only rarely alienated (B.C. is a special case so
I\'m not sure if that applies back east :> ).

  Perhaps someone could give us an Oz perspective?

While we\'re heading OT - I\'mcurrently looking for a DTP package for my Mac.
Ideally, I\'d look at Quark, but realistical I can\'t afford the 800 GBP
cost (sole personal rpg derived income to date 22.95 ;-) ). Now, I was
going to get PageMaker 6.5, but now I notice Adobe is rolling out InDesign.
So do I go for PageMaker (which will likely be reduced to clear) or plump
for InDesign? Answers probably best off list.

ObTrav - I want the DTP package for BITS work.

Me neither.

For example, the testosterone level in the current Ditzie thread is getting
a bit high. The current \'Phwar, Shag That!\' level of the discussion isn\'t
exactly conducive to female posters.

I know that there was at least one woman on the list, but I\'m not sure if
she\'s still around: Suz Dollar.

And that doesn\'t include the cost of upgrading the hardware to make the

Not enough space in the airframe for the radar (or, more specifically,

was equal to ST+DX+EN; a lifeforce of 30 gave you a Hits Value of 4/7. If
you took 4 damage points you were inoperative and 7 would kill you.

We\'ve been playing "mostly" MT, except this point. We\'ve been playing where
dice are rolled for damage (like CT) the first hit came off of 1 stat... the
rest could be spread around as desired.

I have mixed feelings about the exceptional success and extra damage. I
liked the idea of getting more damage for a better hit, but I thought that
x8 damage was a bit extreme.

I was toying around with an idea of +1 die of damage for each number beyond
the target number. For example if you need 7+ to hit and you roll 9 you
would get +2 dice. MT system would double the dice. A roll of 15 would give
you +8 dice. MT would x8 the dice. It think a guass rifle doing 12 dice
damage is pretty good... I think 32 dice is a bit much.

What do you think? Other suggestions? What do you do in CT/MT?

	ISTR reading somewhere that the Q-Ships of WWII used this. A Q-Ship
was an armed merchantman, masquerading as a unarmed merchantman in a
convoy. Idea was, Nazi raiders sneak in for a turkey shoot, and find
themselves wearing the feathers ...

	Anyway, take your average Liberty ship, fill the hold with ping-pong
balls, and tie down guns on the deck ...

The "central" point has to be at geostationary orbit: 38,400km IIRC.
The tether is extended in *both* directions for balance ... But I
don\'t think that\'s three times around the earth. IIRC, the earth\'s
radius is around 40,000km? (Too lazy to look it up ... plus all my
references are in a warehouse somewhere.)

	Not quite. The DGP license granted by GDW did not in anyway strip
the DGP work of its copyright protection. So you can\'t just reword it
and distribute it. But it *did* explicitly reserve for GDW (and now
Marc Miller) the right to reuse the concepts. So *Marc* can

	I did and I really liked it. Made it fast and easy to play (as GM,
*I* kept track of damage, and just told the players "ouch! That
really hurt!" and the like). It modelled the way nobody really keep
track of how badly their hurt in the fight--it\'s afterwards you feel
the pain. That\'s when I rolled the actual damage.

	BTW, I don\'t think 7 meant you were dead, it just meant you were
inoperative: out of the fight. Once all the damage dice were rolled,
THEN you might be dead--unless high-tech medical was available.

High Guard, 2d Ed, p. 15 says:

"The starships operated by the navies of the galaxy range in size from 100
to 1,000,000 tons and represent the most potent weapons available anywhere."

None of the other systems give a specific upper limit, but none of them
give statistics for anything larger than 1,000,000 dtons, either. You could
infer that vessels of more than 1Mdton are possible, but simply haven\'t
been built in the OTU.

I think that eventually you get into a surface area problem ala square/cube

I also like it, but ... It works well with RayDream and 3DS but not with Bryce 
or Poser. In particular, the Poser file format changed between Poser 2 and 
Poser 3 and the stuff you used to be able to do with Detailer and Poser 2 you 
can no longer do with Painter 3D and Poser 3. Hopefully they\'ll fix this.

Somebody else mentioned they were wondering what had changed about Infini-D - 
latest versions are much improved over 4.0 (ie it now works) but still no 
NURBS support, in particular, and in general there seem to be problems with 
the ray tracing engine (specifically, on anti-aliasing). For still-rendering I 
prefer RDS (of the low end packages - I don\'t have LightWave).

I reread the Player\'s Manual, (pg 66, top of second column)
The number before the slash is inoperative, the number after the slash is
killed or destroyed.
So, 4 / 7 would be 4 points to inoperative, 7 points to kill.

Did you use the x2 for +2, x4 for +4 and x8 for +8 rule? What do you think
of adding damage dice instead of multiplying?

G:T: Armor rating (damage resistance) is subtracted from the damage rolled.

I prefer the MT task system... but am looking for something better for
damage determination. I\'m looking for ideas to create some house rules.

Thanks,

There\'s already a very small library at Freelance Traveller, but I don\'t
know if Jeff would want to take on the added duties of something like this.
I\'ll think about it.  I\'ve certainly got the space and bandwidth (both
"unlimited" with my Hosting Service), but I\'m not sure if I can put out the
time necessary to keep the project going and updated.


I\'ve thought about the idea of posting meshes in the past, but I have one
problem with it.  Over the last 3 1/2 months I\'ve put a very large amount of
time (I\'ve lost track of how many man-hours) in creating the meshes that are
shown on my site and in the upcoming SJG G:T books that I\'ve done work for.
I\'ve now got a library of 10 OTU ships and sub-craft, of varying levels of
complexity.  More will be coming in the near future and over the course of
the year based on my conversations with Loren about upcoming G:T books.  I
would have a serious problem with another artist useing my meshes that would
take away business from me, just like a writer would be upset if someone
took 100 pages of manuscript that they\'d posted on their website and turned
it in to SJG as their own.

I think the only way to handle something like this is to have a rule set
about useage (just like the other public domain meshes out there for Star
Wars, Babylon 5, etc).  I would only be comfortable posting my meshes with
the following caveats:  1.Personal use only (exception later) and credit
must be given if used in a picture that\'s posted on the net  2.If it\'s for
commercial use, i.e. you\'re going to use it for pics that you\'re submitting
to one of the Traveller publishers, then I want a % of the profit.  I used
with permission a mesh from a non-Traveller modeler on the web, and I\'m
going to give him 50% of the $ from the pictures that appear with that mesh
in it.  I\'d expect a similar type of arrangement with other Traveller
modelers, but % would not necessarily have to be that high.

My Cr.02 worth of brain fodder.

Jesse

This is a general problem with the web and art IMHO. My wife and I have
struggled with putting her art on the net in a gallery, sales page for
quite a while, the problem is with the proliferation on high quality
printers and graphic programs out there anything published on the web
can, almost easily, be reproduced in acceptable quality.

That\'s not to say that everyone is a cheat. For the most part I think
people are honest, however instant gradification plays into the
equation.

Question: How can you tell if some one is using one of your meshes in a
commercial peice of art submitted to say, SJG? Once it\'s "covered" isn\'t
it hard to tell if it\'s yours, or one they built? 

Maybe a solution would be to offer them, on request,for a small fee,
along with the appropriate "contract" for a % if used comercially.
Another possibility is to only allow them to s select group or club,
again with the approriate contract in place. It\'s a real quandry, since
I know from the generous way you let us on the TML have access to your
work, that you are a generous person, however, your talent should really
be supported as well! (selfish motive here, I want to see more of it!!!)

Just my Cr.02 added to yours

	Not quite. The DGP license granted by GDW did not in anyway strip
the DGP work of its copyright protection. So you can\'t just reword it

Marc Miller) the right to reuse the concepts. So *Marc* can

They have to reach all the way to geo-synchronous orbit. So they\'d only

What do you mean, "to attack"?

You don\'t seem to get it.  The only reason I\'m even bringing up these ammo
tests is because SOMEONE ELSE was perpetuating the rumor that I ALSO thought
to be true until I did some reading--namely, that the caseless ammo wouldn\'t
make it in the field.  I merely returned with, "They tested it, and it makes
it."  Maybe the reason you don\'t think solid propellant surviving a drop
from an aircraft (I\'m not talking about a drop with a parachute) is because
you had some of it hit you on the head?  Hmm?

>It\'s a standard test that anything we are buying or making has to pass.

And I\'m only saying that it passed the test.  Go back and read the thread.

>I can\'t recall the last time something was rejected from our procurement
>system for failing it.

And I\'m saying that there is no reason to reject it because of the ammo and
the soldiers who have tested the thing in the field LOVE it, but because it
isn\'t COLT, American soldiers probably won\'t get it.  That\'s all I\'m
saying....

have to go off of.  Any piece of equipment that\'s yours and you use often
you can usually tell that it\'s yours because of that little tiny scratch
there from the time that...or the burn mark from....or the paint spray
from.....etc.  You get the idea.  In the case of the meshes, I can visually
pick up on little things like boolean artifacts, angles, etc.  There\'s also
a little trick you can do if the belligerant in question just kept being,
well, belligerant.  You can take them to court and have them provide "their"
mesh.  You can then zoom in to certain areas down to the submicron level and
show the jury the little "footprints" that you left.  Really all you need is
your name and a date with a surface color the same as the surrounding area.
This little footprint is barely bigger than a point (a point has no real
physical size and is infintesimally small) and would be virtually impossible
for someone to find unless they knew EXACTLY where it was (i.e. they were
you).  You could even do something like create the footprint, then do an
operation that clones that footprint object to every point present in your
geometry.  As an example, the lowly Scout I\'ve done has 2,437 points WITHOUT
the landing gear, gear doors, turret, and external doors.  With all of it\'s
parts present, it has 11,544 points.  My Marava Far Trader on the other hand
has over 44,000 points in it.  You can see just what kind of a
needle-in-a-haystack that would be for someone who knew about this trick.
It\'s just really not worth it.  In the amount of time it would take someone
to check that many points, they could build about 10 of their OWN damn ships
:)

If I end up posting my meshes to the web, I\'ll have this sort of protection
in place.

As for your wife\'s flat art, there\'s at least one software maker that has a
program that can add a "watermark" to her images that is undectable to
someone who doesn\'t know they exist.  And, the only way to see that
watermark is with that program, so it\'s not like every punk on the \'net
could see it without some investment.  IIRC, even if they have that software
to see it, they still can\'t alter it.  You\'ve then got your proof when you
take their a@@\'es to court :)

Sorry for the delay, but I am still working on the supplements. At present,
I am not even hazarding a guess as to when I will be shipping them. I will
only say that this has turned out to be a very time consuming project, but
that I do manage to work on it at least a couple of hours most every day.

Technically true, but they rapidly were armed with torpedoes, and 
assumed the torpedo boat ecological niche themselves with the 
intention that they would both attack enemy capital ships with 
torps and protect friendlies against similar attack. (cf the 
employment of destroyers at Jutland.)

Hmm... could u give me the stats for this beasty again?  Or point to the date
(or best yet digest #) where this was presented?  I seem to recall the pen

And that\'s where I put my foot in my mouth saying it wasn\'t probably needed by
anything other than perhaps a dedicated pd vehicle.  It largely stands against
conventional arty, but of course FS was left out of my ruminations.  ;-)

Very good question.  Would depend on teh time, range and weapon system I would
think.  Course TL9 should be pretty advanced, though a phalanx type thing
might be required.  Something like the IVIS system immediately turning an
appropriate weapon system on target of an incoming doesn\'t seem preposterous
to me for TL 9.  YMMV.  Inside a certain range and there just isn\'t time to
react, though getting inside a sensors envelope by a system of comparable TL
might require some heavy explanation (and/or nailing more than one target,
before the delivery system gets destroyed by another grav tank).

Maybe in T4...in TNE\'s 5 second combat rounds, most good combat vehicles has a
SA5 *per fire action* (up to 5/round).  On a standard semi auto ROF, that\'d be
4 shots in 20 seconds.  On full bore, it\'s 20 in that same period of time.

The CPR loading times in FF&S is one of the only things I was unsatisfied
with.  When I made up the M256 120mm smoothbore gun (the Rheinmetal-sp?) it
gave a loading time of 4 turns w/ mechanical loading assistance, which is way
off.  During TCGST (Tank Crewman Gunnery Skills Test), tankers are required to
load in 7 seconds for SABOT and HEAT rounds and 9 seconds for MPAT rounds in
air mode (requires flipping a switch on the top of the round) which is 1-2 TNE
combat rounds.  That includes the time to press the knee switch to open the
hydraulic ammo door and arming the main gun.  Now, i\'ve done a sabot in 4.3
seconds and an MPAT Air inside 7 (IIRC on the MPAT).   Is this different in
FFS2?  I don\'t have my copy handy at the moment...

As a house rule, I had the FF&S derived # be the default in rounds and was
divided by the average of STR and AGL for the basic number of rounds.  Next
follows an attribute check (doesn\'t really have much to do w/ skill IMO, just
strength and coordination).  Outstanding success cuts by 1/2, success is
normal, failure is double, catastrophic means that (damaging the round,
releasing the propellant in the vehicle, etc etc).  

The above for Joe Genero would give 20/6 or rounded to 3 rounds or 15 seconds,
which is abysmal.  Oustanding success would let him get it done in 7 seconds
(inside 2 rounds).  Failure would mean he fumbled around gets in the pipe and
probably forgets to arm the gun (causing the TC to smack him when the gun
fails to fire and sends everyone in misfire checks).  Odds say Joe Genero is
either going to be a driver or hating life or he\'ll get stronger from
regularly hefting rounds and/or manually turning the turret 720 degrees
around.  ;-)

I saw a Project Management analysis of the project and it argued that once
the spec was fixed (about 12 months from the end) they were within 3 years
of completion. But at that point it was a political embarrassment.

Do not, on any account, pay money for this.

Run, do not walk, run, to your web browser. Plug in a search for \'THUDDD\'
(three Ds, no quotes). Go to the THUDDD web pages via Craig Berry\'s home page.

Download more ships than you could want for Milleau 0, ranging from
exploratory traders, to lo-tech SDBs for Pocket Empires, to the
Imelda-class yacht for the mega-rich.

Then go to Jesse\'s home page, 
http://www.vision-forge-graphics.com/jesse/traveller/trav_welcome.htm and
print off some starship pictures.

You should have a design that reeks of adventure and some handouts.

Has anyone got deckplans on the web for suitable ships ? I know there are a
set of plans for the FSY Exploratory Trader design, the Recollet (*), but I
got it via snail mail.

(*) Ditzie has been mucking around stealthing, upgunning and generally
modifying one, in order to continue her feud with Gridlore by, as she says,
\'Knocking the Colonel-wonel Daaaaaaaarby cwass into obsoleswence an an an
selling lots an lots of Wecollet Armiiiiigeurs to twooopers all over the

By the way, she wants to know if people want the fusion guns for
atmospheric work in the 50, 100 or 200 megajoule range (projected damage
circa 280, 400 or 520 range, where 20=1 cm of Superdense).

A shipboard FS Gauss Gun is also under consideration.

the RPPG is able to utilise main plant power or an auxilary box of 120 EPG

In short, another example of the design flair and technical excellence for

I couldnt think of whether to go with a EPG based system or good old
regular current from the main power plant, so I went with both.

This baby (known as \'Ditzie\'s Super Soaker\' in some quarters) is capable of
pulling some serious point-defense duty. At 4 rounds per second, and
hitting as hard as a 400 MJ laser, it is capable of keeping a point quite
secure.

Oh, and one of these babies in a turret will give most rampaging mobs pause
before they damage the paint of your nice starship. Plus go
wubba-wubba-wubba real fast as it spews hot plasma death all over the
starport.

Plus you can sign your name in the blast berms.

Hey, thats an idea ... a business recycling EPG cartridges ... re-inject
them with hydrogen, reseal them and then sell to gullible plasma gun owners.

I now have a budding young Burrito File.  Here\'s how I\'ve
organized it:

1. One HTML page per class of NPCs, in Arial 8-point font.

2. Each NPC gets 8 \'lines\' of text -- whatever the page
composer defaulted to.  This text fits onto the blank side of a
ruled 3x5" index card.

3. "Unassigned" cards are organized in clear plastic 4x6" photo
pages. These pages are available at office supply stores, and hold
2 4x6" photos per page.  The pages have holes in the side for
storage in a regular sized binder.  I find that 4 or more index cards
can fit, side down, in each photo pocket.  Thus I have one
pocket (or one page even) per category.  I call these pockets
Resources.

4. In a separate section, pouches are designated as belonging to
a Place -- a city, world, system, whatever.  When I need a persistant
NPC for a Place, I draw one from the appropriate Resource and put
it in that Place.  That NPC now lives there, unless game flow dictates
a move.  There!  Now I have to try it out in a real game.

Given how useful they\'ve proved several times in the "modern, limited
conflict" warfare, I wonder if there might not be some value to
consider building a few BBNs. I think you need at least three to unsure
that you could have continuous coverage of an area by a Battle Group (1
on station, one in transit, 1 being repaired or in reserve). 

I know it\'d never get past Congress, but it\'s still an interesting
idea. Just what *would* be a good design for a BBN? 

Obviously, you\'d have integral Tomahawk launchers as well as the
turreted main guns. What size should the main guns be? 400 mm? 450 mm?
500 mm? How many to a turret? 2 or 3? How many turrets? 2, 3, 4?
What sort of armor? How *big* should the ship be? Do we want to include
launchers for something bigger than tomahawks? Probably not.

I would say that provisions for mounting a *big* laser for anti-air,
anti-missile work should be included. Even a mere 1 MW laser will do
nasty things to most missiles. It\'s not as if the ship can\'t spare the
power. :-)

OBtrav. There will be situations where a world will be ordering ships
that will be built at high TLs but designed to be operated & maintained
at lower TLs (silly example: you are trading with a planet at 1600s TL,
what sort of ships will you sell their wet navy?). What parts of the
ship do you use the high TL for, and which do you use the lower TL for?

I think the hull and internal structure might as well be the high TL,
as major damage requires a shipyard regardless, and any repairs made in
the field would be makeshift anyway.  Weapons definitely need to be
lower TL, simply because they require *lots* of maintenance.

Well, I suspect that one possibility would be to have a mixer/extruder
gizmo. Either it extrudes a "grain" the right length onto the loading
ramp, and it then gets rammed, or it swings into place against the
breech after the ramp is retracted and extrudes the "grain" directly
into the breech. It then swings back to "stowed" position and you close
the breech.

Either way the extruder would only have to endure fairly low pressures
(less than a lot of hydraulics already in the turret) and the two
components would only get mixed as they exited the extruder.

While it\'s not practical for such uses, I\'m reminded of an interesting
binary explosive used in coal mines. You drill the hole, pack it with
cotton, then saturate the cotton with LOX. Ignite with a standard
blasting cap. :-)

Much simpler....

Use bioengineering to produce *lots* of the membrane used by electric
eels, electric rays, and other such critters to generate potential
differences. In essence, you\'ll have *millions* of layers of the
stuff, and a setup that feeded oxygenated glucose solution to them.
That should be able to produce some *incredible* discharges.

An adult electric eel is about as thick as your arm and maybe 2 meters
long. It can discharge *multiple* pulses in the 500 to 1500 volt range,
with enough current to kill a *horse*. 

By stripping the "electric organ" down to its essentials (the membrane
and the solutions), you should be able to get a *lot* more "oomph" out
of it. Voltage depends on the number of layers, current on the area of
the layers. I\'m sure there are references somewhere that give the
details. 

Note that as with most fuel cells the plumbing is a nightmare, since it
has to be set up in such a way as to not act as a conductor between the
individual cells.

Ah, so you didn\'t mean it "didn\'t work", just that it didn\'t work where it
was supposed to .  Sorry, I misunderstood.  By way of apology I offer the
following...


In 1953 the most powerful computers (with names like Eniac and, wait for
it... Maniac!!) were the size of University buildings.  These literally took
weeks to work out comparitively simple sums.  (Less computing power than a
digital watch!)
In 1963 (IIRC) the computer used to control Atlas ICBMs was a box approx 2ft
x 8ft x 20ft. This could control (again, IIRC) the initialization and launch
control for one ICBM.  (Computing power roughly equivalent to a digital
watch with stopwatch and date function).
 In \'my\' computer room we have a CRAY/SGI \'Origin 2000\' used to design and
\'windtunnel test\' Airbus airliners (amongst other things;).  The Origin 2k
is 512 Intel Pentium2\'s running in series/parallel - the system
automatically arranges them in the best \'3d\' config for any particular
problem - Massively Parallel Processing.
These are all \'big\' boxes that require specialized rooms to run in, with
industrial power supplies and *huge* airconditioing requirements..
For a few months we also had a Hitachi supercomputer that was (IIRC) almost
as capable as the Origin 2k but in a box about 50cm x 100cm x 75cm, with a
sculptured \'wavy\' top to stop idiots putting their coffee cups on it - this
is designed to sit in a normal, air-conditioned office with Secretaries,
Juniors and Users next to it - something that would have been undreamed of
with the other systems.

Some Desktop systems are now approaching the capability of CRAY
supercomputers designed in the 1980\'s.  Data storage has improved by so much
that even the phrase \'orders of magnitude\' hardly touches it.

ObTrav:  Someone (Imperial Intelligence in disguise?) approaches the party
and asks them to take a \'pocket calculator\' to a neighbouring world.
Unbeknown to the pc\'s though, the \'calculator\' contains the memory chip from
a sophisticated spy system that the locals would like to get their grubby
mitts on...  Always assuming that \'Imperial Intelligence\' is not a
contradiction in terms ;).

Imperial Navy\'s biggest waste of money?  The "Bwana Always Everywhere
Watching-3" Elint cruiser - a converted Type C with a huge sensor suite
(both PESA and AESA) attatched to a mod/1 computer armed with four  and a
huge nose blister that ground crew can never resist painting red...

While I\'d be perfectly happy with the ruleset you suggest, my initial suggestion was more aimed at the amateurs sharing with each other rather than the professionals (or professional, singular) sharing with the amateurs. I don\'t think anyone would begrudge you keeping the ones you do to yourself, given the knock on improvement on published Traveller material.
One idea might be to get a license from Marc, or through one of the existing licenses, and sell the meshes. I don\'t know how much you\'re getting from SJG, but you might be able to find some happy medium whereby you can also sell the meshes on the side for a decent price. As for submitting them to SJG, I\'d be surprised if anyone could match the quality of the texturing anyway.

Minor error - colored by my recollections of destroyer actions against

british destroyer? Not enough to sink it, but effectively a mission-kill.

	ISTR reading somewhere that the Q-Ships of WWII used this. A Q-Ship
was an armed merchantman, masquerading as a unarmed merchantman in a
convoy. Idea was, Nazi raiders sneak in for a turkey shoot, and find

You can build as large as you want, but you quickly begin to run into major
problems in surface area.  Big ships need lots of power, which needs lots
of surface area for radiators.

I did a million-man colonist vessel.. that was about 5 Mdt IIRC.

Heinlein can be directly applied to Traveller.  The discussion on Q boats
can be directly applied to Traveller.  Asking for a review of "The Green
Berets" is not related to traveller, and should be addressed in another forum.

If you had asked about Imperial Special-ops forces, or mentioned the
book/movie in relation to a proposed campaign, that would have been
on-topic.

work.  I certainly hope more people out there get interested in the fun.
It\'s like building a plastic model kit where you have to make the pieces,
put \'em together, and then make the paint to paint \'em with =)  I\'m sure
Chris Cox and Mike Linsenmayer can agree with me on that (if they\'re out
there on the TML).

As always I\'ll give any help, advice, or tips that I can when it comes to 3D
artwork.  With the completion of my new Sulieman I should have a tutorial on
building it up sometime shortly after the Starports deadline on the 29th.

I\'ve given a little bit of thought to the licensing issue, but haven\'t
mulled it over enough yet :)

Keep in mind the different logistical situations. The Americans had larger
reserves of manpower, more equipment, generally more everything. They
could afford costly victories, or even several defeats, and still keep
fighting. The British were stretched mighty thin, and knew it.  They
couldn\'t afford any more heavy losses.

(That said, my grandafther was always extremely scathing of Monty, more so
than anyone else I\'ve ever heard him talk about, so there\'s at least one
British Army vet who didn\'t like him.)

	Can\'t argue, as my PM is with all my other worldly possessions,
being abused in a warehouse somewhere. I could have sworn there was
something in there (or in the ref\'s manual) that the second number
wasn\'t actually killed for characters, just critical, near-death.
Death was if, when you actually rolled the damage dice, all three
characteristics wound up zero.

license.

	Or, have Ditzie hunt down and ... de-exist ... Roger Sanger (who
bought DGP, and is apparently being irrational about licensing it),
and then talk to his heirs ...

	Oh, and make sure Ditzie knows the difference between Roger Sanger,
and Paul Sanders (this confusion popped up a while back ...)

	Worked great for me when I ref\'d. But why restrict yourself to just
8 lines? I used as much as I needed, and could fit on a 3x5 card
front & back. There\'s a couple of useful programs out there to
intercept printer output, do any necessary rescaling and layout, and
tile it front & back on the sheet. Also organizes the pages to allow
booklet folding, etc. Marvelous tool for getting loads of info
without wasting paper, or doing special things like weapons & NPC
cards. The one I use is ClickBook, and it\'s available for Mac and
Winblows.

	As Bruce correctly pointed out, the Torpedo Boat Destroyer very
quickly took on the characteristics of its prey, and was used both to
attack and defend capital ships. Wasn\'t there a fairly big nigthttime
action in the Pacific between a Japanese carrier fleet and a US
destroyer squadron?

	Americans were also still applying lessons learned in our Civil War.
McClellan and some of the other commanders who foolowied him were cautious,
slow and put the preservation of their army at the top of their priority
list--and the result was failure and stalemate over and over again against a
numerically inferior opponent.  Grant, Sherman and the later commanders made
constant engagement and winning strtegic victories regardless of tacitical
cost as the high priority and this led to the final victory (at a high cost in
lives).   The lesson the Americans learned, and continued to apply was that
high casulties in the short run are worth the cost since the war will be over
sooner and the total casulties will in fact be lower.

Your right,

The damage assesment was to determine how  damaged they are. If the first
number is not reached, none of the characteristics are allowed to go below
zero. If the second number was not reached, all three characteristics are
not allowed to go below zero. If all three characteristics reach zero,
diagnosis within 1D minutes will keep the character (barely) alive long
enough to get into a low berth or to nearby  tech 9+ hospital

I guess, technically, reaching the second number brings you to a "destroyed"
state... but not actual death.

Thanks for that Jesse. To tell you the truth I already was using some of your
scans on two of my machines, and I\'m sure a few other people I know are doing
so as well, basd on the number of people who asked me where I got the cool
wallpaper, though I did tell them to go to your site to find them, so at least

Resistance in Gurps.

Didn\'t TNE use a DR system? I\'ve only seen the cover... so I know almost
nothing about TNE.

I\'m looking for help in determining what the DR should be for armor and what
the damage should be for weapons. I was comparing the stats in G:T and MT.

It looks like more damage dice are added to weapons with higher penetraition
and those with really low penetration actually have less damage.

MT: A guass pistol (dmg 4D , pen 4) would do 2D damage to an unarmored
person on a roll of 7.
G:T : A guass pistol (dmg 6(2)) would do 6D damage to an unarmored person on
a successful attack.

Same scenario, but target has Combat Enviro Suit (AR Value 6 / DR 24)
MT: Guass Pistol does 0d damage (1/10 dmg for zero pen and 1/2 for marg.
success / 0.2d damage)
G:T : Guass Pistol does 6d damage, DR is 1/2 for guass weapon, result, 6d -
12 points.

Doesn\'t G:T seem a lot deadlier? Consider a Gurps character on average has
10 HT and a traveller character has 21 lifeforce (7\'s in ST, DX, EN). It
could take 4 shots with the guass pistol in MT to kill and just 1 in Gurps.
How damaging should a guass pistol be?

I was almost thinking that the Gurps numbers would work better for traveller
unadjusted. What do all y\'all think? If I come up with a good conversion,
I\'ll post it on a web page.

The only reason that Freelance Traveller\'s Multimedia Gallery is
small is because I don\'t get a lot of contributions.  I have a
few more Linsenmayers that I have to put in; lately, time and
life (and I don\'t mean the magazines, either) have been
conspiring to keep me from spending as much time on site
maintenance as I\'d like.  It looks like I may be able to get a
break to do some of this stuff soon; it will be lots easier
if/when Downport supports the FrontPage extensions.  I\'ve also
been concentrating on trying to analyze why some people seem to
get the pages screwed up when they view \'em; that problem is now
"solved" and waiting for upload.  The problem is that there\'s a
bug in Netscape that doesn\'t exist in IE; Netscape either
distorts background images or doesn\'t handle mixed width
specifications on tables properly.

If other people are willing to run these contests, I\'m willing to
host a page/pages in the Gallery for the winners.  As far as
rights go, all rights remain with the creator - and so does all
responsibility.  I _can\'t_ stop people from misusing what\'s
posted on Freelance Traveller; if the creator sees misuse, it\'s
his/her responsibility to pursue it.  The most that I will do is,
at the creator\'s request, _reluctantly_ remove it from Freelance
Traveller.

We have recently had the distinct pleasure to view your proposal for a 
120mm RF gauss gun (aka Ditzies little helper).

We cannot however not understand why the gun uses TL-4 KEAP rounds when 
it could be using TL-8 APFSDSDU round or even TL-12 APFSDSSD.

Dimashq Industries

<serious mode>
Ian, you made a slight oversight when you designed the weapon. At higher 
TL:s than 4 the pen rating is multiplied with a constant as the 
projectile becomes more advanced. With APFSDSDU the pen rating would 
become 936. If this sounds to much for anyone remember that the gun has 
~27 times more power than the Rheinmetal 120mm smoothbore on M1:s and 
Leopards. 
<serious mode off>

Ohh, and as we are talking guass weapons:
Why doesnt velocity effect the gun barrel in terms of weight even 
slighty. Some thing like Wt = Cal^2*Vel/60000 (tons) maybe.

Im trying to design a 10-cm Gauss RapidFire heavy mortar but the barrel 
weights 4 tons and that is a little to much for a mortar in my taste 
(especially as it has 4 barrels).

MT ships are the only kind I have ever designed... it took a while to get a
good understanding of what the rules are doing... theirs a bit of going back
and changing what you did because it doesn\'t work farther along the design
sequence. I find using a spreadsheet helps greatly. At the very least, have
a calculator handy. Also, for your first designs, make simple things...
maybe a grav tank or a fighter... then redesign a scout ship. This may help
when making more "custom" designs.

I found having the 101 vehicles from DGP very useful in figuring out MT
design.

Good luck with HG!

I think I like the HG system for being its simplicity (Compared to MT). I\'ve
never seen FFS(2), so I don\'t know how difficult they can get their. I saw a
spreadsheet someone made for T4 and it seemed to have similarities to MT.

Basically, you test munitions to see what happens to them if they\'re hit
by enemy fire. Assuming the hit isn\'t immediately catastrophic (i.e. no
form of ammunition is going to fail to burn when hit by the jet from a
HEAT warhead), the worst any ammunition should do is burn *slowly*
(since rapid burning and low-order detonation are in essence the same
thing).

Now, if a munition is capable of surviving this kind of treatment, it\'s
safe to drop.

We already use combustible case ammo in the field (not quite the same as
caseless, but nearly). Why would I think that it\'s unsafe? I get the
impression that we\'ve been arguing the same side here.

Ah, NIH. It is a trait observed far to often on your side of the pond.

ObTrav: Although people might express a preference for gear made in a
particular system, is NIH going to be a major problem for the Imperium\'s

 You can build as large as you want, but you quickly begin to run into major
 problems in surface area.  Big ships need lots of power, which needs lots
 of surface area for radiators.

I had the distinct pleasure of gaming with Steve Jackson at CoastCon
this weekend (the Lego Pirate Game).  Today, at a panel discussion, he
was wearing a t-shirt that read, in part, "Steve 1, Secret Service 0." 
At least _one_ of the two parties involved in that mess has a sense of
humor....

(BTW, I also had the pleasure of getting Evil Stevie\'s autograph... in a
copy of the SJG edition of _Principia Discordia_.  He thanked me for my
help in running the Lego Pirate Game.  ~walking on air, with a big ol\'
grin ~)  

ObTrav:  What would be the most likely security agency, in the 3I circa
1100, to pull something like the SS raid on SJG?

	Douglas fir, is ever-so-slightly-more than neutrally boyant when
waterlogged.  It also will not burn worth a damn, but will produce
horrible amounts of smoke trying...
	So, U-Boat slugs the Q-Ship with its deck gun at the waterline,
and is gratified to see great gouts of white smoke pooring out the cargo
hatches in short order.  The they get the nasty surprise....

I\'ve used (MTU) a veriation on this, the Wideangle Heavy Attack Microwave
(WHAM) Cannon and one use pulse missiles (WHAM Shots) the principle was to
blind, usually slowly by frying the sensor arrrays of opposing ships. The
physics was wobbly (if not ignored) and degrading effects relied on sensor
locks being required before fireing.

If anyone can gear head a toy (pwease Miz Ditzie) I\'d love to see it on the

Unitll recently ping-pong balls were made of two thin celluloide shells.
Celluloide is/was much more flamable than modern plastics (ref Clif\'s
pyrotecnic TML 320). The volume of air (oxygen) to celluloide (Carbon) on a
carton (or ships hold)of ping-pong balls cica 1940 is a relatively poor
explosive, but great site for a fire.

Rather than duplicate effort, I recommend that you check the
sci.military.naval newsgroup on DejaNews.  You\'ll find quite an
extensive discussion on this and related subjects.  The bottom line is,
few (more accurately: no) informed naval analysts will state, given the
current naval combat environment, that a ship armed with
battleship-sized guns is cost-effective as new construction.  A few
folks will (reluctantly) suggest that the IOWAs, since they are already
built (and modernized), are sufficiently useful to keep on standby in
the Naval Reserve.  (TravRef: the Mothball Fleet).

In Traveller, fighters (and thus carriers) are of minor importance in
major fleet actions, ship spinal mount guns can reach hundreds of
thousands of kilometers in a couple of seconds, and missiles are of
secondary importance in capital-ship combat (due to PD lasers,
sandcasters, nuclear dampers, and distance).

Find a way to accelerate fighters to at least 10x the average speed of a
fleet (in World War II terms, 200 knots versus 20 knots), and
Traveller\'s combat assumptions will change as radically as they did
during World War II. 

I wouldn\'t suggest, however, that you use Traveller combat assumptions
to decide what forces would be useful in Milieu:  AD 2000.

I figure that, to maintained at a lower TL, a starship should be built
to within a TL or so of the supporting TL.  (That\'s why, in my ref\'s TU,
the TL13 BROOKLYN-class cruiser is new construction in the M:1100
Spinward Marches.)

At the risk of making an overly personal observation, I\'ll note that no
matter which of the two mental pictures you have of "Ditzie", the

earlier this year, and the reason. (Nasty case of child abuse, for you
newcomers.)  There\'s something about the tone of some of the remarks that

Generally not a big deal if the problem is a cracked hull from torpedo hits,
but if the torpedo hit somehow caused a fire - or if the Q-ship were attacked
by a deck gun or aircraft cannon - you probably weren\'t putting the fire out
in time for it to matter.

This is third hand from a WW2 convoy escort captain to my US Coast

Hmm.

The Imperium seems to rely on early delaying actions, followed by massive
retaliation supported by both technological and logistical superiority.  

From what I recall, Imperial strategy seemed to be fairly direct during
most wars. Rather in the nature of (1) assemble your forces, (2) head
straight for the enemy and beat him.  This seems to be backed up by the
battle rider doctrine.

The Zhodani, OTOH, seem to be pursuing an indirect strategy (although
their goal is not what the Imperium thinks it is).

I know this is OT and has been replied to several times. Bear with me and
I\'ll bring it kicking and screaming back to Traveller.

Bismark was hit by an aerial torpedo from a Fairey Swordfish that crippled
her stearing gear and enabled the Home fleet to catch and pummel her.
Now one of the main reasons why the Swordfish was able to score the hit
was because Bismark\'s radar controlled AA guns were calibrated for a
minimum target speed of 100 knots. However the venerable old Swordfish
was an obsolete biplane (TL 5 Vs TL 6) and made its attack run at a speed
of less than 100 knots (around 80 IIRC). Now to drag the topic KaS back to
Traveller, just how often do high tech forces get themselves into this sort of
situation. Imagine if you will the Imperial Marine with his/her FGMP-14 and
battledress with advanced sensors. Along comes your TL 3 guerilla with
his/her rifled musket, triangular socket bayonet, paint bomb and a few human
looking local critter decoys...

Hindsight and all but I wish I\'d known the "in" joke before my first post -
the fact that Ditzie\'s actually just a little kid.  That would have
prevented alot of that.

I\'m sticking with the little Ditzie as she\'s alot like my kid sister Erin
(who\'s now not such a kid anymore) and there\'s alot more potential for just
good ol\' comic relief instead of fueling the (mentally) adolescent fatansies
of a few members of the TML.

On a positive note, I did get a personal e-mail from a female TML\'er whose
name I shall protect (I\'ve always had an anacrhonistic streak of chivalry in
the modern screwed up world).  To directly quote her "I think your
characterisation was great. I\'ve always seen Ditzie as a wide-eyed angelic
pyschotic maniac."  I couldn\'t have put it better myself :)  I hope everyone
on the list can just sit back and enjoy the Ditzie stuff I\'ve done (and the
FS press releases posted by Ian) at their face value, as a good little
chuckle between flame wars.

OK Ditzie, you can put the particle accelerator away now....


Best,
Jesse

Have you written up the Lex specs for "ditzie speak"? You should. It\'ll
save you time, and the filter would be fun for everyone.

As to the "indirect fire" role of the weapon, the high muzzle velocity
is going to set *severe* restrictions on its use. Those rounds are
travelling at half of Earth orbital velocity. 

Work out the range at 45 degrees. Also work out the peak altitude
reached and the total flight time. Then try the same calcs for 70 or 80
degrees (true "plunging fire"). I suspect that the flight time will be
excessive. And that the peak altitude will be such that low orbital
installations are in danger.

Luckily, I doubt that the power requirements would be low enough for

In such a situation, having the CG act as if it was *attracting* the

 Actually, AOL\'s internal browser is an older IE, and has this "amusing"

the AOL cache version is unopenable in anything but AOL. I hate

Including your own, Jesse.  YOU drew the pic!  : )  It\'s really STUPID to be
putting down "mentally adolescent fantasies" on a mailing list about a
Role-playing game.

Face it!  Gamers are geeks!  You\'re a geek!  I\'m a geek!  (I know, Dough,
you\'re not a geek.  You\'re a big he-man, bad-ass, etc., etc., who still
can\'t find it in himself to crack on himself now and then.)  What the hell
are we really doing wasting are time on this game, anyway?  If we can\'t
fantasize and escape and have a little fun, what the hell good is the game
in the first place?

That\'s what makes Jesse one of the nicest people on the list.  He doesn\'t
take himself too seriously.

ThumbsPlus will do it as well.  I love the program and use it extensively in
my web prep work, as well as for selecting wallpapers, and just plain
all-around graphics management.  You can try it out at www.cerious.com.  If
you try it, you\'ll wanna\' buy it like I did!!!!

  You could probably build a missile with some useful space combat duration
at 40-80 G\'s, but I don\'t see how that would change a small crafts striking

Even without obscenities like the FS Gauss Gun (and I\'m still not convinced
it\'s an effective artillery weapon - any sane power plant will take yonks
to repower the 170 ton battery pack), there are still enough ATGMs floating
around a TL9 battlefield to make at least a 20mm high ROF autocannon plus a
small radar/ladar a good investment.

The way I look at it, at TL6 naval missiles became common, and at TL7 big
ships started to get point defense. Now, at TL8, it\'s on virtually every
\'real\' naval ship.

Now, an effective land point defense system has to be smaller and better,
because ground vehicles and missiles are smaller.

I\'d be interested to see how a ZSU or equivalent would do against TOW and
similar, if it\'s radar could be tweaked enough to deal with ground clutter.
Something like FLIR could actually be better than radar, die to a lack of
ground clutter effects.

My guess is \'not often\' at TL9, \'probably\' at TL10 and \'yes\' at TL11.

This will basically make solid rounds workable at TL9, obsolescent at TL10
and obsolete at TL11, which is the way I feel it should be.

You might want to look at the FS Rapid Pulse Plasma Gun for an idea of what
you can do at TL12 in the way of a point defense weapon.

The problem isnt the range, it\'s the refraction from differing densities in
the atmosphere and so on. If you are trying to plug individual tanks from
orbit, then 5 meters out with a laser just doesnt cut it.

Cloud cover will also limit you, and chew up rather a lot of power.

One of the themes of the Imperial Rules of War is \'No-one makes War in

the deliberately loose guidelines.

This isnt an issue in TNE, but then again TNE doesnt interest me.

Fantastic shots!  That scout base is really cool, I like the fact that the
hangers look almost like something out of WWII, and not all High Tech like
the ships themselves!

Glad to see you went for the classic geometry!  I\'ve always loved that
shape for a ship, dating back to what I suspect are it\'s origins in "Planet
of the Apes".

Any chance of you doing some future ones in 1280x1024 :^)  All my systems
have that size desktops and I\'d love to use one of your shots for a desktop
picture!

Okay this was totally uncalled for. Rob is a teacher and by all accounts is
dealing with a nasty case of abuse involving one of his students. Abuse is
a nasty brutish thing that leaves everyone touched by it scared. Rob has
asked politely that a particular topic of discussion be dropped for personal
reasons. Nobody is asking you to walk on eggshells, somebody is asking
for people to show a little common decency and respect. I work with abuse
surviors and perpertrators and it ain\'t fun,in fact its a shitty fucking disgusting
mess. And everyday you get to deal with ignorant attitudes and just
sometimes it gets too much and you ask for the those misinformed
attitudes to please shut up.

>No one here is advocating child molestation.

I know you honestly believe what you just said, and a lot if not all
of the people here would agree with you, but you\'re wrong. You may
not be advocating child abuse, but your (and lots of other people
here) attitudes are helping to make abuse possible.

Okay, so this had nothing to do with Traveller, and I\'ve probably gone
more than a little over the top with my rant. But sometimes the shit
gets to you.

maybe inertial compensators are limited to 6G, thus preventing manned craft
from exceeding the 6G barrier, but what\'s to stop building a ship-killer
missile?  Even accounting for relatavistic effects, I find it relatively
easy to obtain .1C+ velocities in a reasonable time.  For example, before
relativity rears it\'s ugly head, a 100G missile accelerating for only one
20-minute HG turn will reach a whopping (V=1/2AT^2)
(7.056*10^8m/s=[.5][9.8m/s/s][100][1200sec][1200sec]) 705,600km/sec, or
roughly 2.5C.  Now, off the top of my head, I can\'t recall the formula for
relativity, so could someone either come up with that or perhaps show me the
error in my (rusty) astrophysics.  BTW, the "warhead" on this missile is a

Clif, those two things are not contradictory.

AIIIIEEEEE!!!!

This is a really, *really* BAD IDEA. Under even moderate "compression"
match-heads have been known to self-ignite. At least you are using a
ping-pong ball, not a used CO2 cartridge. So you\'ll only have 2nd & 3rd
degree burns to worry about, not shrapnel, and blast effects.

Out of curiousity, how did you arrive at the "contraband" list? Is
there some sort of "standard" list floating around, or has it been
compiled from experience at your location only?

If there\'s a standard list, it might be interesting to post it just to
show the sort of stuff that *can* be dangerous in the wrong hands.

Because the barrel is a simple "guide tube". Unlike a gun barrel, it
doesn\'t have to withstand huge pressures. 

Depending on whether the weapon is a "rail" gun or a "coil" gun, there
may or may not be extra bracing needed to resist the "recoil" of
accelerating the projectile. But this doesn\'t need as much mass as a
regular gun barrel.

Why would there be a difference between a coil gun and a rail gun in terms
of recoil stress on the launch tube? Electromangnetic forces act upon the
bullet to accelerate it to V and thus imparts an equal but opposite
direction momentum in both cases.

Maybe the coilgun does most of the acceleration at a shorter time?

Then the MD barrel should be considerably lighter. A 10cmL60 gun is 1.2 
tons and a 10 cm MD barrel comes at 2 tons. At even larger caliberes it 
becomes worse.

But should a 300m/s barrel be the same thing as a 6000 m/s barrel? In 
the gauss handgun design sequence it doesn\'t. It probably isn\'t as 
linear as in the handgun sequence (and in my proposal above) but there 
should be a difference as the 6000m/s barrel would have to handle 400 
times the energy compared with the 300 m/s barrel. The difference in 
power cabling, length and whatever accelerates the projectile (rail or 
coil) should be noticeable (i.e. I want my MD mortar).

The problem is probably that MD:s " in FFS1&2 aren\'t as "fleshed out 
compared with chemical guns. I remember trying to design a MD grenade 
launcher under FFS1 and I ended up using a lot of assumptions.

Maybe MD mortars should have their own design sequence? Any takers?

>Cmdr X where are you :*>

Right here!

While no, you can\'t put a spinal mount on a fighter, you CAN put a 3ton
PAW or Meson on it!

X-TEK Industries of Deneb, LIC has produced a PAW fighter (TTL-15/GTL-12)
and an experimental Meson Fighter (TTL-16/GTL-13).  Stats are on the X-TEK
website.  The PAW fighter is in both HG and GURPS stats, the meson fighter
in GURPS stats.

These weapons are extreamly short ranged when compaired to laser weapons.
The fighters are heavily armored to resist fire and get inclose to fire
their gun.

<Shameless Plug>
You can view the stats for these and many other X-TEK ships and weapon
systems on the X-TEK website:
http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/xtek/xtek.htm
Select "Year 1100" for HG and "Year 1120" for GURPS

Also, look for upcomming X-TEK news releases as it works on its new ad
campaign to counteract the "Ditziemania" that has swept the Imperium!  And
its merger with Maximus Interstellar Defence Industries. "X-TEK/Maximus
Industries, We don\'t kid around!"

Bravo, Bruce. I belatedly and heartly second this observation. I\'d be
embarrassed as hell to let my girlfriend read half of the comments I\'ve
seen this morning (as I dig through the backlog created by days of neglect
- -- 1,300+ messages -- aiieee!). I think the phrase she would use is "why
those rotten suckers." ;-)

ObTrav (aw, man, now I gotta turn this "me too" post into a Trav\' post):
Hmm. Rotten suckers. That puts me in mind of the old AD&D monster called
the rot grub. *That* puts me in mind of alien life forms that might be
dangerous or hostile to Travellers.

I remember whan I was young there was a book that dealt with dangerous
alien life forms -- not Traveller, but one of a group of books that were
published in the late 70s/early 80s. IIRC, essentially what the authors did
was take a bunch of sf paintings, bundle them together and write a
narrative about them as if the scenes were actually photos of some real,
living, future universe. IIRC, there was a book on dangerous alien life
forms, one that was sort of an overview of popular tourist sites in the
galaxy, one that was a listing of ships (much like the Salamander books of
modern military hardware you used to be able to find on the bargain book
tables in stores like B. Dalton and Waldenbooks), and a couple that dealt
with a hypothetical future war (between a federation composed of humans
from Terra and near-humans from Alpha Centauri against another agressive
near-human race from Proxima Centauri). I *loved* these books when I was a
kid.

Anyway, the thing I remember most about the book about dangerous aliens was
that there was an entry for this highly dangerous bipedal organism that
originated on this little blue planet that orbited a type G2V star. The
place had been essentially "red zoned," because the inhabitants were
considered every bit as dangerous if not more dangerous than the amorphous
blob horrors and trans-dimensional psionic death-trees that were the other
subjects of the book.

But that\'s actually besides my point. What I would like to know is this:
Does anyone know what the titles of these books are or who published them?

Okay, so that wasn\'t exactly ObTrav, but it was close. How\'s this ...

ObTrav: Would the Imperium red-zone a minor human world that was, say, TTL
6-8 if it\'s inhabitants were highly xenophobic and aggressive? Or would
they just roll in like the biggest steamroller this side of <insert
favorite wrathful deity here> and flatten said xenophobic, aggressive minor
humans into abject submission?

Clif, you are truly beneath contempt.  I\'m convinced that you suffer
from some severe form of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.  The arrested
emotional development is a bit more blatantly obvious.

I\'d love to have you come out west so some of us on the left coast
could demonstrate just exactly what kind of "geeks" we are, but I\'d
be wasting me time.  As my grandfather (and doubtless many others)
were fond of saying, "Never wrestle with a pig.  All you get is
filthy and the pig loves it." :^(

However, since you are using grav plates to make a parallel-deck ship
feasable anyway, why not just line up the decks so that they are neither
parallel nor perpendicular to thrust, but rather just parallel to the
bottom spine of the ship? That way you could have a nose-down Suleiman,
without nose-down decks when you turn off the artificial grav.

This is kind of a test post to see if my posting problems have been
eliminated.

I\'ve been working on an intro scenario for trav and I\'m trying to
determine some way of preserving a relic starship on a plant surface for
use by future generation. As an example - a critical starship component
is broken and the crew of a vessel wants to preserve the ship for future
use if a replacement part can be manufactured. Any ideas on how long the
basic integrity of the systems (airlock seals, etc. ) can be relied on
in a standard earth type atmosphere.

The tar pits come to mind, perhaps pump the ship full of noble gas and
coat it in tar?

Hope this gets through,

Glenn

Dont use tar, corrosive.  You need to get hold of some natural rubber or
latex, coat it in that, the noble gas idea sounds good, though a vacuum
would be better.  Be sure you get the humidity down if you use a gas.

Sheesh!  Go big or go home, eh?  My favorite motto!!!  That\'s why I shoot a
.45 USP instead of those little baby catridges ;D

I\'ll see what I can do.  My eventual plan for the gallery portion is to have
several different sizes/resolutions/compressions available, so if you\'re
internet connection is a nice fat pipe, you can download a 1280x1024 at 100%
if you want to.  Not recommended for less than 56k :)  Right now I don\'t
have the time to set that up, but when I do I\'ll send a message to the TML.

Best,
Jesse

2 WE\'RE GEEKS???!!!!  What??!!  Nobody told me that!  When did this happen!?

3 fantasize and escape from reality is great.  It\'s better than choosing drugs
or something else dangerous/illegal as an escape.  HOWEVER i\'m sure Cliff that
you\'re not suggesting that fantasies (even slightly sexual) about a very young
girl are a normal, no I didn\'t think you were, even in RPGs.

  {
    'body' => 'One of my players expressed interest in playing a \'new\' minor race in our new campaign, so I asked him to go ahead and create a race. This is what he came up with (with a little help from me):

Komodani (Tjassi-ssri-sstarr): Intelligent minor race originating on Heath (0209 Trojan Reach).
The Komodani is a bipedal, carnivorous reptilian. They are divided into male and female sex. The hands and feet each have 5 digits with claws. The saliva is rich on bacteria and is highly infecteous - it acts as pre-digesting agent. The Komodani spine ends in a tail which easily reaches the ground when the individual is standing upright. The Komodani are coldblooded and thus have no self-heating or cooling mechanism. Instead, they rely on external heat-supply in order to maintain appropriate body-heat and vice-versa regarding body-heat reduction. Comfortable temperature for a Komodani is around 33.8C.

Average height is 1.9 meters for the male, and 2.2 meters for the female. Average weight is 130 kg for males and 180 kg for females. Eyesight is poor, hearing is average, but the sense of smell is high. The Komodani uses flickering of the tongue as a sensory apparatus for smell. Sense of motion is also high when on all fours, otherwise it is average. Komodani possess average motorskills.

This minor race spends two thirds of the day resting; the remaining one-third is spent throughout the day - both nocturnal and daytime.

The Komodani female lays appoximately 50 eggs in a batch after a pregnancy lasting up to 200 days. Hatching-time of the eggs is 30 days. In the period following the hatching the young are only raised by the female Komodani. The young live in constant fear of predation by the males, and the actual survival rate is only 20 to 30 percent. Male Komadani lives on average 130 standard years - female lifespan is somewhat shorter; only 90 standard years.

Having reptilian origins, the Komodani seldom needs to feed. This is done approximately every 100 days and is called "The Calling" (klariss-rasstirr). The male Komodani will hunt for food in the wild, returning for 3 to 4 days to his savage state and engage in a feeding frenzy. When the male returns from the hunt, he will have only a slight memory of what happened. Most criminals are male Komodani who did not manage to get into the wild before undergoing "The Calling".

Architecture: Typical Komodani constructions use natural or artificially made caves as the base-form. Each guild will have a central plaza (usually including a hot-spring). Living quarters make up the inner ring surounding the plaza. The second ring contains educational and administrative constructions. In the outer ring one will find factories and storage areas. The guild areas are connected by large tunnels.

Communication: The Komodani have only one spoken language but several writen ones. A common writen language does exist but each guild also has it\'s own which is used when guild matters are involved. The Komodani rely heavily on signs and body-language; even scent is involved when the Komodani communicate with each other. This is the reason it is virtually impossible for any non-komodani to speak/see/smell the language fluently.

Evolution: Archeological findings support the thesis that the Komodani are a separately evolved race. These findings are however very inconclusive due to the fact that the Komodani race has not shown any interest in archeology whatsoever until recently.

The separation of the sexes is seen as a simple mean of survival. The early Komodani were so aggresive that any contact between male and female would result in lethal combat and the death of at least one of the Komodani. Hence the Komodani live apart. It is believed that a gradual change in the climate, in the form of global cooling, sparked the need for a more intelligent Komodani. There is evidence that in the archeological period where the cooling took place there where a limited amount of geographical locations where thermal heat escaped the planet core (hot-springs, mud-pools etc.). These places where used by the females as breeding grounds, and taking into account that the physical size of the female in those days exceeded the size of the male with up to 100%, the male would have little hope of gaining any territory in the heated geographical areas. It is thought that the necessity for an external heat-supply forced the males to rely on self-initiated means of heating th!
eir bodies. On the other hand, the females did not have a need for intelligence since they had the physical power to hold on to the increasingly important heated areas.

The female Komodani still use these heated locations as their territories, but in modern days the male Komodani have built several artificial hot-spots where the females can live. Since the race rely on an external heat supply in order to survive the male has no problem in finding a female when the need for breeding arises.

It is believed that the uncontrollable desire to breed was kept in the nature of the male in order to force the male Komodani away from their safe, self-heated areas and engage in the ordeal of mating. Not only would the male have to cross country where the threat of death by freezing was ever present - the male also had to fight the physically stronger female if the race as a whole were to survive. Hence the unavoidable desire to mate among the male Komodani. Since the male would need all his strength in the ordeal, the body and mind enters a state of frenzy where everything is centered around brute physical strength (this explains why the female breeding grounds are kept away from the male society).

Since the young male Komodani would be driven away from the heated areas by the young females from their batch, it was, and still is, necessary for the young males\' survival that the adult male population can keep them out of harms way when the young females start showing signs of territorial demand.

History: The most significant fact when looking at this minor race from a historical point of view is that the pace in which the Komodani develop and change their society is relativly slow. They do not seem to approach change with much eagerness, relying instead on carefully taken steps towards both social and technological advancements. There has not been done much research into the Komodani history prior to First Contact.

Although some tales suggests that the Komodani experienced visits from the stars already during the First Imperium, no evidence has been uncovered to prove the theory neither right nor wrong. Ancient Komodani legends tell about god-like beings who descended from the heavens riding on large animals, and wielding mighty powers of destruction and healing.

These tales have first been written down in much more recent times, and it is unclear from which period they originate, or if more than one visit took place. Researchers has theorized on a number of different possibilities, claiming that the visitors were respectively Vilani, Vargr or Aslan. No conclusive evidence has been uncovered to support neither theory, neither on Heath nor on any other planet.

The first documentable contact with off-worlders happened in -161 when Floriani explorers contacted the Komodani, who at that time had a stable and slowly progressing tech level 7 society. Although science was advanced, knowledge of the true nature of the stars and planets was only in it\'s formative period, as the planet\'s sky is mostly overcast, which caused the Komodani to begin to speculate about the nature of the universe outside their world rather late. Still, it was not totally incomprehensible to the locals when they were contacted by off-worlders.

Floriani-Komodani relations have been relatively uneventful since then. Both races are somewhat placid and normally unaggressive, so no reason for conflict between the two races has ever appeared.

Although the Floriani in general seems to like the Komodani, Heath has never been a member of the Florian League, despite it\'s proximity to Floria (0213 Trojan Reach). Trade and commerce between the two races has been conducted on a steadily increasing level, as the Komodani society has been advancing.

The Komodani came into contact with the third Imperium for the first time in 203 when imperial scouts landed on their homeworld. At this time, Komodani had already been offworld, and some had even met Aslan. Although small in numbers, Floriani were always present on Heath, and the Komodani had been members, albeit not very important ones, of interstellar society for over 300 years. The IISS decided to leave the minor race to the Floriani, and established friendly although irregular ties with the Komodani.

Today, Heath is still mostly oriented towards Floria, but many Komodani also travel to the Third Imperium for trade, education or cultural exchange, and the world is occasionally visited by an Imperial ship. Komodani-Aslan relations in recent times have been cool, but almost non-existing.

Homeworld: Heath (0209 Trojan Reach B487532-B) is the name used among humans. The Komodani themselves call the world Tjassi-ssri-rassh-kiasrr. Although archeological evidence suggests that the middle temperature once was about 30C, the world experienced a major shift in climate about the time when the Komodani started on the evolutional path towards intelligence (it was this shift which sparked this development in the first place). Major geological upheaval, possibly caused by a passing large celestial body, caused the atmospheric composition to change, lowering the greenhouse effect and increasing the world\'s albedo. The result was a much cooler world, and this situation has remained unchanged until this day, where the mean temperature is around 14C. The sky is mostly overcast.

One local day is approximately 14 hours and 40 minutes. One local year is 112.47 standard days.

Heath is governed by a group of Elders (Jgarrioss Hjrar B\'tass). Each member of this council has been recruited from one of the many guilds. The selection-process is strictly in the hands of the B\'tass. There are 21 members of the council and it is headed by a Hrjar Ustass (coordinator). No guild may be represented by more than one member in the B\'tass. The council may not interfere in intra-guild matters but may step in as mediator in inter-guild quarrels and disputes when these seem unresolvable by the guilds themselves - this does however require a request from the involved guilds. The B\'tass takes care of all matters regarding off-planet relationships - the council was in fact only established as a result of First Contact. The Komodani realized that they needed a way in which their interests could be communicated to and coordinated with off-world cultures. Some may say that the existense of the B\'tass is in conflict with The One Law but the Komodani themselves see it as a !
necessity in dealing with off-worlders, since the have realized that the The One Law is not universally recognized.

With respect to The One Law, off-worlders are usually regarded as intelligent beings. There are no weapons restrictions on Heath, since self-defence is seen as a legal response to violence. One should however note that the degree of violence used in self-defence must reflect the degree of the attack upon the victim\'s freedom.

Society: Komodani society only has a very loose structure. Individual status is determined by physical size. Male and female societies are divided and the two sexes only interact when mating occurs. Intelligence is much more advanced in the male part of the population. The females act as drones and do not possess any culture. Male Komodani must venture into the wild in order to find a female. When found, the female will seldomly willingly mate. After breeding, the male returns to society. This happens once every 400 days and is called "The Beginning" (ssafo-kjiass). 200 local days later, and also only once every 400 local days male hunting groups will gather in order to retrieve male young from the wild. Not many young survive this, but are instead killed and eaten in the proces. This event is known by the male society as "The Turning" (kssirr-brass). Every adult male participating in this event (only the ones who participated in the previous Beginning) will try to capture one!
 young male - this must be one of his own hatchlings - and bring this young Komodani back to society where the upbringing will take place. The adult male recognizes his own off-spring by scent. Other hatchlings that the adult male encounters, will be killed and sometimes eaten.

The male society (tjassi-ssri-sstarr) is devoted to the search for knowledge. The male Komodani loathes the savage side of himself - the genetic programming that makes him crave The Beginning and The Turning. As a consequence of this the male will act very peacefully when not engaged in the two reproduction events. The society has only one law: Thou shall not hinder the personal freedom of another intelligent Komodani. This law is seldomly broken - and when it is, punishment is swift and merciless. The criminal will be hunted down by other males and will be executed. By breaking The One Law (xserss-biass) the criminal has lost his status as an intelligent Komodani and has thereby lost his protected status. This hunting proces will also call forth the savage side of the male.

The male community is made up by various guilds which span from the Brass-ksarr (sanitary) to the Stiash-mniss (space-tech). The Komodani do not place any guild over the other. The young male will be brought up in his father\'s guild and will take his place when the older male dies. All have equal status in society. This is probably a derived effect from The One Law. The guilds usually interact with each other. Some guilds even have representives within the bounderies of other guilds. The above mentioned Brass-ksarr is a good example of the inter-guild coorporation.

Each male will spend at least one year in the Drasaur-Jiss (Guild of the Claw) learning basic combat techniques. Many of the young males will then continue their fighting training in the various military guilds. The basic training will aid the young males when mating and it also serves as a necessary base of personal discipline in the remainder of the young male\'s life. It is during this year that the males learn to contain their natural aggressive behavior.

The Komodani seem to have a relaxed attitude towards other races, but it should be noted that no non-Komodani has ever been taken in by a Komodani guild. Some visitors have been known to misunderstand the Komodani\'s attitude regarding personal freedom and thought them lawless. The only type of crime the Komodani have any concept of is the use of physical violence. However since other forms of non-Komodani crime usually involve a violation of the personal freedom of other individuals the punishment will be swift. The Komodani have no judicial system - punishment will be executed by the guild that happens upon the criminal act. There are only 3 types of disciplinary action among the Komodani: Warning, banishment and death. The Komodani do not see activities where a personal choice is involved as criminal. It does not matter if an invidual wants to destroy himself by using drugs as long as that individual does not interfere with the freedom of other individuals. The drug-abuser p!
ersonally chooses to buy (or sell) drugs and this is not against The One Law. If, however, this is forced upon an individual it is an all together different matter. The same goes for areas such as prostitution and gambling.

At our facility "contraband" is defined as ANYTHING that can not be purchased
at the facilities commisary OR any item purchased at the commisary but then
altered in any way.

The match head thing was learned from experiences at a riot at the Corcoran St
Prison where inmates stuffed match heads in tooth paste tubes with a
wick/fuse.  This created a small incindiary type explosive that they used to
start various fires at long (throwing) distance.

Our contraband definition is so broad because "they" have 24/7 to figure out

Well, I believe somebody has mentioned that the Scout uses two landing struts
and the tail to form its landing tripod.  Makes sense too, since most of the
weight is in the rear, volumewise and densitywise (drives and plants)

At current tech levels, hard kill defences for land vehicles are
unlikely, since the weapons don\'t scale. You use a missile the size of a
sidewinder or a 20mm cannon to defeat a naval missile weighing a few
hundred kilos. What do you use to kill a man-portable ATGW with an all-
up mass of 50kg?

For current tech, look to soft kill (Arena/Shorta) and improved reactive
armour (Kontact-5).

TOW is slow flying, and it\'s not a crossing target. Then again, it\'s
small. The best use for that ZSU would be to hose down the area where
the launch signature came from, since you can kill the operator and
abort the missile before it hits you.

Use a cheap penetrator with a simple homing unit and guidance fins. Drop
from orbit. Repeat. Sure, you are ammo limited (vice a laser with a
fusion power supply); but it\'ll work through clouds, fog, smoke,
moisture...

Not really. While no-one is using Q-Ships, the U-boats will at least
give the crew/passengers time to abandon ship before using the deck gun.
When it gets out that this trick is going on, they\'ll just use torpedoes
from underwater and d*mn the conventions.

ObTrav: I know that the Imperial Rules of War prevent the use of nukes;
but is there any requirement to give a freighter crew time to abandon
ship before it\'s vapourised?

Mark, I must (somewhat reluctantly) come to Clif\'s defense on this one
point.

I admit that I\'m a geek, though I\'ve never done that thing with the 
chicken.  *grin*  And escapism is my primary reason for gaming, and gaming
my primary form of escapism.  So on this point, I have to agree.

However, Clif:  another poster made a request to end this topic based on
RL unpleasantness and issues deriving therefrom.  That\'s a FULL STOP on
the joking for me (and should be for you too); it\'s like a woman saying
"no," or "safeword."  It means that the kidding around is done and that
to continue is to deliberately cause pain to another human being, however
ephemeral they may seem over the Net at times.

Never mock or criticize someone for spoiling your "fun" because it touches
on painful personal stuff.  If nothing else, remember karma - that which
you do shall be returned to you threefold someday.

I know you honestly believe what you just said, and a lot if not all
of the people here would agree with you, but you\'re wrong. You may
not be advocating child abuse, but your (and lots of other people
here) attitudes are helping to make abuse possible.

No, YOU are wrong.  It is a legal system which outlaws a patriarch taking a
rapist\'s life into his own hands that enables abuse of children.

>Okay, so this had nothing to do with Traveller, and I\'ve probably gone
more than a little over the top with my rant. But sometimes the shit

You\'re telling ME?  My own sister was molested.  It\'s not the guys who can
appreciate a well-drawn cartoon of a girl with a big gun that you have to
worry about it.  So tell me all about it, why don\'t you?

A combat critter that gets to act intelligent, but keeps getting sidetracked
by genetically-programmed atavism. 

Feeds once every three months? It must go into a torpor after feeding,
because it just ate enough to choke a (human) platoon.

This race will probably only exist on their homeworld, with very rare
exceptions. They turn unintelligent and go hunting every 100 days, which
means they\'ll have to hunt in an appropriate environment - which means
home. At most, you\'ll meet travelling Komodani within five or six jumps
of Heath - say, ten to twenty parsecs max range? Any more and they
won\'t be able to get home for their hunting instincts to come out.

Sounds like their thin veneer of civilization tears the moment they think
someone has broken their One Law. Interesting, as a horde of tranquil
philosophers become red-clawed predators at the drop of a faux-pas.

There\'s a problem with the description of the males as devoted to the
pursuit of knowledge, and the description of the race as somewhat 
plodding and slow to develop - unless, of course, Komodani just aren\'t
that good at science and creative thinking. Combine a traditionalistic
culture with individual random bouts of savagery, this might be the result.

Imagines the First Contact team being introduced to the greatest
Komodani philosophers and scientists, and realizing these worthies
can\'t tell a hypothesis from a hypotenuse...but could shred you in a
moment if you annoy them. <weg>

Lurk cloak off.

Okay Clif, your own self righteous preaching has gone too far.  I come to
this list to get ideas, and have a good time with others of like mind.  I
made my own male oriented comments about the drawings.  Then I dropped
it.  If what I said insulted someone, my apologies.  We do NOT have the
right to slam others, nor  to act without tact or respect for others. 
That applies to you as well.  I don\'t give a damn what you have been
through, you still have to act with respect for others, no matter whether
you want to or not.  If someone asks you to drop it, respectfully, then
drop it.  IF you want to debate someone on a subject, then do so off
list.  You\'ve been asked to drop this more than once.  Drop it.  Now.

Marines had M-16s, but us swabbies still had shotguns.

Looking back on it, I prefer the way we were armed.  The .45 has enough
authority to stop someone, but probably won\'t put a hole in a high pressure
steam line - and the shotgun is a very authoritive passageway sweeper - and
the ranges inside the skin of the ship make it *very* effective.

I remember my father telling me about something similar to this from when
he was in the South Pacific in the 2nd World War.  It seems that the local
medium bomber squadron on occasion dropped what were called "bird dogs",
which were basicly one or two ounce lead fishing weights with small tin
fins, on suspected Japanese positions.  Individually they were not too
impressive, but when a flight of B-25\'s overflew a beach area where they
were taking fire from and dumped several tons of the little beasties, my
father changed his opinion.  When they went ashore from the PT boat to
investigate, he said all they found was shredded jungle.

OB Trav:  Trapped on a low tech world with the Chamax advancing, all you
have is a pinnace, a coulple brawnly locals with shovels, and a lots of
lead fishing weights...

Very well written and presented.  Both you and your player are to be 
commended on the quality of the presentation.  I do note some 
similarities between the Komodani of the Trojan Reaches and the 
Drakarans from coreward of Gvurrdon sector.  (Details on the 
Drakarans can be found in GT: Alien Races 1.)  It might be worth 
looking into for some additional ideas, although you do seem to have 
a lot of bases covered already.  :)

Thanks for sharing that with us.

        Actually, the issue was economics...  they had more deckgun rounds
than torpedoes, and Q-Ships were always "tramps"...  alone, no convoy
escorts, or straggling behind a convoy just a bit too far for the escorts to
get to...  in other words, a prime candiate for the U-Boat to surface and
shell stupid.
        In most cases, the ship the U-Boat surfaced and shelled *was* a
straggler or a tramp.  So, the U-Boat captains always took the risk, saving
the torpedoes for situations where they *had* to attack submerged.

A different tack might be that the Komadani might be purists, in the sense
that they have mastered the higher theories of mathematics, etc., they
simply have not applied the principals to practical matters.  They might
simply appreciate the subtle aesthetics of the sciences without getting
their appendages \'dirty.\' <g>  Cultural pressures, religious convictions, or
their own unique perspective on The Universe (tm) could be used to explain
this behavior.

  As to a Ships locker on  Scout ship, ACRs do not seem 
unreasonable to me.

  Depends how many and how much ammo.


  If the landing part of a Donosev finds tracks of a 
Crested Jabberwock, then calling up to have the ACRs 
sent down does not seem unreasonable.

  If there was a war going on then having ACRs would
not make a lot of difference.  They had best hope that
no one starts firing missiles at them.

I must admit that I had some problems with this one, and that\'s the 
reason why I referenced earlier to the GT Minor Race, the Drakarans.  
Their feeding cycle is once every 20ish days.  The 100 day feeding 
cycle might be better served by lowering it, or by providing other 
means of Komodani sustenance.  (Like a sugar-water drink or something 
that gives them the calories to burn during active periods, or 
something.)  Just a thought.

Also, consider the requirement of a heightened heat source, brought 
about by the change that also gave rise to their intelligence.  In 
the beginning, the Komodani most likely couldn\'t have created 
artificial sources, but if you picture their homeworld as being, at 
least initially, volcanic, then the hotspots near volcanic areas 
becomes prime territory.  The need to possess this territory 
probably helped develop the intelligence of the species, and 
eventually, when reproducible means of creating and maintaining fire 
was developed, the population spread from the mountain ranges, etc, 
and into uncharted territory.

I like this interpretation, as it leads well into the next point.

Simply put, the Komodani aren\'t that bright, as a race.  Given their 
One Law, it would seem that the race is more prone to violent 
eruptions than they would like to be, and the One Law serves as their 
justification.  While not very advanced technologically, the Komodani 
are probably well developed in their Social structures, analyzing all 
situations with a view toward rationalizing their violent 
predispositions.  Hence the One Law becomes just that, the only law 
they need.  The permutations of its interpretation, however, could 
take volumes to cover.  A professor of ethics would have a field day 
on a research sabbatical on Heath, at least until he violated 
someone\'s personal freedom unintentionally.  <Adventure Idea>

You want Book 5 : High Guard. make sure it\'s the second edition though.

If you\'re in the UK try BITS, if you\'re in the US I\'m sure someone else

The Ship Design System ;-)

It seems more complex and less straight forward. HG2 appears to have been
thought through a bit more.

Respectfully Sir, Cleon the First\'s reduction and depopulation of Keshi
(1938 Core), the capital of the Chanestin Kingdom, in 2 Imperial could
hardly be called \'honourable\'. Similarly, the sterilisation of an entire
planet\'s ecosystem such as practiced in Ilelish, or the entire basis of the
Zhunastu school of contact, are not actions which could ever be described
as honourable.

The Imperium grew from the actions of men and women which would not be
accepted in today\'s superficial, politically correct, Empire. These
people\'s decisions shaped our future, building an Empire greater than any
ever seen before. We should be thankful that we live in these sheltered,
stable, times and not in the blackness before the dawn of the new age, at
the ending of the Long Night. We do not have to face the same decisions,
nor test ourselves against morals and honour when they conflict political
demands in the same way our ancestors did.

To pretend the Imperium is innocent, and honourable, is to deceive oneself.
Honour is the guiding principle, but not a blinding principle as seen in
the Aslan. One has only to consider Cleon\'s ninety seventh edict to see
this any means necessary approach.

With kind regards,

A Realist.

I don\'t have doubts bout the main or coaxial/secondary weapons on grav tanks
to be able to take an ATGM, at least if they have a ballistic computer and
stabalization.  For really convoluted systems, a dedicated pd platform is
needed.  IMOA.  YMMV.

We already have an MCD that works.  It isn\'t shooting down the incoming, but
it still works.  Radar, HRT/EMS sensors are standard on any grav tank, even
the TL9 ones.

Yup.  Also from the TL-15 PD APC in RCVG (RPW-15H, 18.5 Mj ROF 5 fusion gun).
That\' up to 25 shots in one 5 second turn.  Pen Val: 129-129-65-13.

From 3000 km, the TL11 80Mj laser found on the only "canon" ortillery squadron
in any books of mine (the 4518th Lift Infantry, the Duke of Regina\'s Own
Huscarles, which use system defense boats, presumably TL12 Shukugans) has a
performance of  1/7-22 in a standard atmosphere, which will be enough to ruin
any grav tanks day. (pen up to 166- of the high end Imperial/Regency vehicles
only the TL-15 Heavy Grav tank is safe on anything but the frontal arc).  A
whole grav tank division will be picked off if they can\'t do something to stop
the ortillery squadron (PDM, deep site, COACC friendly space forces), either.
Move up to TL12 120Mj (pen 255), much less TL15 150Mj (pen 322) or 210Mj (pen
444), lasers and it gets very messy.

Um... U mean with the ortillery?  I\'m not assuming any particular scenario,
though this could apply an anti insurgency mission *by* the 3I or a combat
situation between the 3I and another power (Zhos, Solomani, K\'kree vs Hivers,
etc).

Nope.  Damage Value and Penetration Rating vs Armor Value for character scale.
Vehicles up use a penetration value (divide DV by Pen Rtg) vs armor value.

A TL-13 gauss pistol w/ dart ammo has a Pen of Nil and won\'t penetrate a
Combat Environment Suit (AV 1).  HEAP rounds have a DV of 3 and Pen of 2-2-2.
Joe Genero would take 1 dice of damage and has 14 points in the head, 42 in
the chest and 28 for everything else.  Max possible damage from one shot is 24
(6 x 2 for outstanding success x 2 for quick kill), which is serious to the
head, slight to the chest, and serious to everything else.  Damage to an
unarmored Joe Genero has a max possible of 48 by dart, which will critical
everything but the chest (serious), and 72 by HEAP (ditto).

I use TNE w/ D10s for damage and the T2k quick kill, which tailored
particulars more towards my tastes.

With Scouts expected to be out of the ship a fair amount of time, in
potentially hostile environments, and with their primary threat being from
animals, how about a good hunting rifle style weapon in addition to
shotguns? With a few of each, it seems a scout crew woul;d be well
equipped for their mission.

Is there a real-life vessel analogous to a Scout Courier in mission?

IMTU, the IISS is part of the Imperial Military, so putting an ACR in the

Personally, I\'m suprised he didn\'t try the argument that they should have

Sticking in an animation loop where it rotates on the axis may be
a good look.  The general problem with transparent objects is that
their implementation varies from browser to browser.  At home with
my Riva TNT card it looks nice.  At work, the browser defaults to
\'screen door\' tranparency and the look isn\'t as good.

Perhaps replacing the sphere with a neon green 3d cross hair (at
the center of the sphere) would aid in the illusion.  Possibly
bright green with alternating dark green can be used to built a
grid.  Alternately, a transparent GIF can be used to great effect
as a circular grid on the \'horizon\'.

One possiblity is to chorigraph the fight off the bow of the ship
and add a LOD group to easy the CPU burden when not at the bridge.

Pixels 3D 2.1.4 (an older version) is available for free as well, see
www.pixels.com but you have to call them for a serial #. Then they have

The $10 Strata was charging was S/H; the product is listed as free on
their web site. As to the legalities, I have no clue, but since they\'re
giving it away in mass fashion like that I rather doubt they\'d care.

Hmmm.  I\'m not sure which is the scarey part: my vita or the comment
about the pig! :^)

Well, I can\'t really speak to that.  I\'m pretty fair with a handgun
but my wife Lori is a match for me in both SMG and Tac. Shotgun.

You know, Jesse, if you\'re ever up north, you *really* should stop
by so I can play host out at the range for an afternoon.

To unsubscribe to Traveller-Digest, send the command:

I assume that you send

if you want out of the non-Digest version.

I would give them weapons that are good for repelling boarders, but not

could believe that the Ditzie pictured was legal.

As I recall, the remark I made was to the effect of "If I didn\'t

flirt with her".

I get the digest version of the list, and I only check my mail
once a day.  Thus, when I reply, it usually ends up in the _next_
day\'s digest load.  So, by the time my comment above made it to
the digest, it\'s quite likely that Jesse\'s misconception had been
corrected, and the picture in question had been removed (I
_still_ think it should have been left up - it\'s a good
picture!).  I don\'t know what the delay to the reflector list is;
it may or may not have been down by the time my message got to
the reflector folks.

If I\'ve offended anyone by my remark, I apologize.  More, I
apologize for making a remark that apparently set off a couple of
people; such was _not_ my intent.  I was thinking of it as a
compliment to Jesse\'s drawing skill - a skill that I wish I had,

How long you want to preserve it?

Slight internal overpressure should keep the other gases out.

If you can put it in a cave, or in this case, put a cave around it,
to protect it from the elements, that would help.  I\'d think about
burying it too, to preserve it from erosive effects of the environment
if thats a concern.

<TNE example snipped>

GURPS example:
Gauss Pistol does 6d(2).  This is a projectile weapon, so blowthrough occurs at
1x HT.  This is an AP projectile, so damage is halved after applying DR.  The
order in which the halving and the blowthrough occur is not entirely clear,
arguments can be made both ways.  We will assume we are shooting at Joe Genero
(HT 10)
If blowthrough occurs first, damage is almost always 5.  Roughly a 50% chance
that Joe is knocked down; if he isn\'t, 50% chance he\'s stunned.  Zero chance of
direct lethality, though if untreated he has a small chance of bleeding to
death.
If blowthrough occurs second, there\'s about a 60% chance of doing 10 points,
which will on average render Joe unconscious in about 2 seconds (and have
effects as above); otherwise effects are basically as above.  There is a
moderate chance of bleeding to death.

If the shot was in the brain, average damage is 40, Joe makes 5 death checks
and has about a 97% chance of dying, and is automatically unconscious; assuming
he survives, bleeding to death is likely.

If the shot was in the vitals, average damage is 31, Joe makes 3 death checks
and has about a 87% chance of dying; assuming he survives, bleeding to death is
likely.

Note, however, that the gauss pistol in GT is a fully automatic weapon, and is
in fact rather low lethality.

This *is* edited. Those of you who know Rob will now that he is usually
impeccably polite, and constructive, and does not tend to flame up. Suffice
it to say that he was not happy.

The upshot of this is that all Rob\'s Traveller software work is off for the
foreseeable future, plus he will no longer be contributing further new
material to BITS or from his own site. This, in my opinion (which is biased
as I consider Rob a personal friend) is a great loss to the TML, to BITS,
and to Traveller, for which you can thank Clif.

I could rant here, but the perpetrator has run away, and it isn\'t worth it.
Maybe if enough people contact Rob, maybe if people are a little more
supportive, maybe if people think of others before they write, maybe he\'ll
be back sooner rather than later. That is if you prefer the contribution of
someone who has written material for Traveller since MT days, has provided
some really good GURPS Traveller and T4 material both as shareware and
freely, and is always positive. If you prefer the *contributions* of the
likes of Clif, perhaps you\'d like to say so I can consider unsubscribing
too.

What are the limits of the "weapon" mustering out benefit?  The book says,
IIRC, that it is applicable to a skill the character has, and subsequent
rolls of "weapon" can either mean multiple weapons or additional skill
levels.  We had a character muster out recently and his only weapons skill
was high energy weapons.  To compound things he was from a TL-15 world and
mustered out on a TL-15 world.  

Since he did not have battledress, there was only one weapon he qualified
for...FGMP-15.  Granted, the scenario was a trip into the jaws of hell, and
the firepower helped, I still can not come to terms that the Imperial
Marines would allow someone to claim a fusion gun as a benefit of service
unless the handwave was that he was doing \'odd jobs\' for the Marines and
they knew where he might end up.

adding to it as needed to insure that a positive (above normal
atmospheric) pressure is maintaind, is also desirable.

Unfortuantely, this method doesn\'t make any allowances for gravity
"settling". Many of the components will suffer some warpage, dependant
on time. A check of all air-tight joints and a good balancing for any
rotating parts (such as generator rotors) would be needed during
re-commisioning.

Not sure what long term gravity effects on electronic components might
be.

By the way the nitrogen container storage method is how most large
machinery rotors are stored. They are typically "hung" by one end in
storage to reduce the effects of gravity warpage. At my facility we\'ve
used this  method to store rotors for up to a decade, with a 1# positive
nitrogen blanket. Once unsealed they\'ve shown no deterioration. They
were also check balanced and found to need very little re-work before
use.

Hmmm, you might concider disassembling delicate components and storing
them external of the craft in proper storage containers. This might
eleminate some of the gravitic effects.

	An ACR in a scout ship\'s locker sounds perfectly appropriate.   It is a
military weapon but it is not all that much more damaging than a hunting
rifle, only with a higher ROF.   I believe all sorts of paramilitary groups in

availible as back-up  (US Coast Guard, Treasury Agents, Border Patrol etc).

Well, I can\'t claim Rob as a personal friend, since I don\'t know him. However, I
consider him one of the people on the TML that I pay attention to. I get the TML

It is unfortunate that one arrogant jerk has ruined the "taste" of the TML for
someone who posts quality stuff. The TML has suffered a loss with Rob\'s absence.
Speaking for me, Rob will be missed.

IIRC, the first year of military service is basic training, and the character
gets Combat Rifleman skill (or whatever the equivalent is in the flavor of
Traveller you play). That means that, IMTU, each military character must be
qualified on a weapon like an ACR. So the mustering out benefit would be an ACR
in this case.

You\'re right. IMTU, the military doesn\'t allow "military weapons" to be
mustering out benefits. The exact definition of that term is open to debate,
naturally. I generally translate it to mean "reasonable weapon".

If the character does have an FGMP-15, there are certain problems you can impose
upon the character to make life interesting. If the weapon breaks down, there
are only a few worlds where it can be serviced (the nearest Marine base is, of
course, not normally an option for civilians). As an energy weapon, it\'s very
illegal on worlds with a law level of 1 or 2 (I forget which). Plus a weapon
that powerful is bound to be in demand by disreputable types on any world.

Allow me to concur. So it isn\'t Ditzie. I can always use a picture of a
strong character (male or female) for my games. I like being able to
show my players a picture and say "This is what he/she looks like."
Unfortunately I can\'t put pen to paper without ruining both, so I\'m
forced to fall back on photocopies and, nowadays, gifs (Strictly
personal use, btw.). So put her up again, Jesse, please?

Mind you, although I think the Young Ditzie pictures are fun, I can\'t
actually use them for anything (I\'m not letting Ditzie into any of MY
universes, thank you very much! I spend far too much time building them...)
And if Legal Ditzie is carrying a MegaGun, I\'ll be hard pressed to find
a use for her, but maybe she\'d do for a certain NPC... Anyway, I\'d like
to see it.

One must remember that in GURPS there is the "blow-thru"-rule, that states
that on a normal body hit a bullet attack can only do up to HT of damage.
Also as the death caused by damage over 2xHT can be avoided by a succesful
HT rolls, it can take from 2 to 6 average damage (21 pts, 10 after
blow-thru) hits to kill an unarmored character.

Russian "trawler"? Probably smells about the same...

There really is little need for such a vessel in this age of more-or-less
instant communications. Prior to the advent of the wireless, a frigate or
packet steamer was probably closest in function. A PBY "Catalina" amphibian
might be a mid-20th century equivalent.

From the Digest battledress article: the armour "has a few dangerously weak
spots" such as the visor which is only the equivalent of cloth.

Basically, you need a pinpoint shot to penetrate the armour. Probably your
average joe could\'t do it, but if you were facing Daniel Day-Lewis* you
would be in trouble.

	  The HBC would have had exclusive trading rights within the
North-West -
	the British Crown never claimed to own the land, I suspect.
Certainly
	monopoly trading companies were very popular with early modern
European
	governments, not least because they brought private capital into
service
	of State interests (which was a two-way street...).

	  For most of the period Crown land would likely simply have been
land
	that wasn\'t held as private property (ignoring aboriginals here);
IIRC,
	nowadays Crown land is only rarely alienated (B.C. is a special case
so
	I\'m not sure if that applies back east :> ).

	  Perhaps someone could give us an Oz perspective?

	        Steven Hudson

Pretty much the case here. It was all considered Crown Land and squatter\'s
then purchased rights to it from the crown (not sure how much it was
though). I think 70% of Australia is still crown land which is then leased
in 99 year leases to farmers and the like, unless it is national parkland,
then we just lease bits of it so they can mine uranium. Conservative
government, what are you going to do. 

Although purchases from Natives did occur such as Melbourne, which was
bought for blankets and knives and when that didn\'t work, we committed
genocide (white settlers were very enthusiastic ethnic cleansers of the
first order). 

As for native rights, their lack of it boils down to the fact that legally
Australia was regarded as Terra Anullius, (I think it means unclaimed land.)
Essentially as Aborigines didn\'t claim it (hell, they couldn\'t understand
the concept of boundaries and were nomadic to boot) then they lost it. 

A similar situation could make any colonization of planets with sentient
life quite interesting.

PS Sorry if I answered this wrongly. What\'s the protocol?

The blow-through rule is not clearly stated in any part of the rules, but
judging by the examples in G:High-tech, the blow-through limit is not
affected by the bullet type multiplier. Therefore the second of your

4.  Some of my T4 designs are conversions of my HG2 designs.  Would
there be much interest in my posting the HG version as well?

I think it is great that we can all rally around someone we know only on a
mailing list.  I value Rob\'s input, and I feel it\'s a shame that he decided
to withdraw from active participation on the list.  I look forward to his
eventual return.

It was, however, his choice.

I haven\'t voluntarily read a message from Clif for 2 months, unless the
response showed it to be something worthwhile.  For a while, I stopped
reading the responses because they were as low in Traveller content as the
original posts - unless someone whose opinion I respected chimed in.  Still,
I think it\'s a shame that he found it necessary to leave the list.  (read
that - finally badgered and driven off the list)  We are trying to promote
interest in Traveller as a whole, not just our particular visions of how it
should be.  Every person we drive away is that much less support we will
have in the future.

I find it completely reprehensible that the personal attacks on him are
continuing *after* he has withdrawn from the list.

ObTrav - there is nothing remotely resembling Traveller in this post or in
any of the posts in this ugly thread.  I would not sully the game by trying
to bring in a traveller reference.  Hopefully, this will be the last post on
this topic.  If you find it necessary to discuss this with me, do it
off-list.  My email address is, as always, douglas@teleport.com

I didn\'t even know of the blow-through rules. Sadly, the only gurps rules I
have are the "Gurps Lite". I was only basing my examples on what I saw in
the G:T book and the Gurps Lite.

Is the G:T book in error? On page 110 it states that Gauss Guns fire
high-intensity dart ammunition. Armor DR is halved, but damage is not halved
after penetrating DR.

I\'m no GURPS expert, but that\'s about way I read the rules too, and I
mean the rules in the Basic book.  My reading was that you roll 6d and
reduce it by one point for each 2 points of armor penetrated and then
apply the rest to the target.

There *is* a blow-through rule (optional, like most GURPS rules), that
limits the amount of damage to some max (don\'t have my books here, but
I think it\'s HT). 

Let\'s say Joe Generio (10) had armor with 10 DR (that\'s pretty good
personal armor, I think) and your 6d roll was 21 with no modifications
for where it hits. After penetrating the armor (2 for 1) you\'d have 11
points left. If I\'m remembering the blow-through right, and I\'m
probably not, then 10 of the 11 points would be inside of Joe and 1
would exit hitting the armor on his other side.

Or something like that,

I\'ve got a sample ships locker posted on my site.  You might also want to check out the

Really Black Ops would probabvly be carried out by the IISS.  Scouts are

like introducing tailored virii to destroy a zhodani world\'s grain crop.

Military types tend to stand out, which hurts their usefulness in these
kinds of missions.

IMTU, the Scouts are the main intellegence branch of the Imperium, sort of
like the CIA.

I give characters like that a shotgun or carbine as a default weapon, though

Higher speed missiles would increase the range at which missiles could be
fired at capital ships.  Since most of the damage from missiles in Traveller
(G:T at any rate) is from kinetic damage the faster the missile goes the
more damage.

More effective yet would be the development of a weapon that could be
carried by a fighter and have enough power to defeat battleship armor.  WW
II aircraft were a danger to shipping because dumb bombs big enough to sink
a ship could be used against targets that were basically incapable of
shooting down the delivering aircraft.  That and the cost factor. The cost
of an airplane squadron (including support) was much less than the cost of a
ship. Note that the cost factor breaks down in modern times; when not only
is the aircraft that delivers the smart bomb more expensive than the target.
The cost of the smart bomb is more than the cost of the target.

Traveller fighters are much cheaper than capital ships, but they have no
weapon that can really wax an armored battlerider or cruiser.

Please don\'t use a dog.  The Ancients took wolves from Terra some
300,000 years ago, a very long time before humans developed the many
modern breeds of domestic dog.  ("Varg" means "wolf" in Swedish, by the
way.)

Gravball players need some kind of armor, too, as I recall.  I\'ll see if
I can find my copy of the game (I wonder which box it\'s in?) and look at
the 15mm Martian Metals figures that came with it.  

On text (further to my email), "branch" is too high an organizational
level.  I\'d go with something like "1144th Exploration Squadron, Regina
Subsector".

PAO IRIS CORE CAPITAL Press Conference  11:30 Capital Time <on vid>

Communications Director, Directorate Public Affairs Office Jahon Lowvitz
<under Director>

Citizens of the Imperium:

My fellow Sophonts of the Third Imperium, the Imperial Regency of
Security and Intelligence would like to clear the air regarding the
involvement of the Emperor and His Government in alleged covert
operations, euphemistically called "Black Ops" by those romantically
minded members of the press corps. The reality of our situation is much
blander than the typical Starport newstand spy-thriller. There is no
"Capable Group", nor is there a Iamaes Bindii 2XX. Although there are
many excellent female sophonts serving IRIS and the Imperium, there is
no Ditzee Spofulam, Agent of Chaos, serving in the field for our
agency,. much to our complete regret! <laughter and hoots from male
press corps members>

Firstly, let me state that IRIS has never conducted covert operations
against citizens of the Third Imperium and its member states. Our
charter <DOC I> expressly forbids such actions and the \'constitution\' of
the Imperium has through tradition and precedence of law eliminated such
actions from the perview of all members of the Imperial Intelligence
Community, except in times of war. Such actions are only taken on the
advise and consent of the Moot. We all know we are not in a state of war
with any of our neighbors. I\'m sure Holo Headline News and our friends
at HNN would like a change in that state. <laughter> Who can forget
their epic reporting under fire from behind the Frontier! We should
commend Piotr Harnett for his brave coverage! <applause, embarrased
reporter stands up and meekly bows >

Secondly, as per our charter (DOC I) IRIS can only conduct covert
operations within territories of enemies of the Imperium. These actions
may only be taken with the express approval and oversight of the Emperor
himself. However, IRIS uses this Imperial Charter provision strictly in
manifesting review of activities of members of the Imperial Intelligence
Community. IRIS at this time is categorically, not engaging in such
activity in any foreign power, as that would violate treaty obligations
established with our Coreward and Spinward neighbors. <quiet calls of
\'Zhos\' from the press gallery>

Thirdly, our charter is of primary of purpose the protection of the
Imperial Body and Family. Our agency as budgeted by the Exchequer in the
1095-1115 Authorization is mandated to provide this security for the
safety and continuity of the Imperium at exclusion of other missions
previously associated with IRIS. We at IRIS are \'brown-baggers\',  there
are no  Jump-3 lunches on our watch. <laughter> IRIS is the
clearinghouse for information and intelligence to the Emperor from our
more munificent friends in the Imperial Intelligence Community. At IRIS
we employ librarians and information scientists. Our typical employee is
not espionage material. We\'d make terrible characters on the Holovid and
I\'m sure had we been a series, IRIS would have been cancelled after the
Pilot. <snickering> And I\'ve never fired a PGMP-14, though there are
some days...<pointing to various reporters in audience, much laughter>

In conclusion, my fellow sophonts,  rumours to the contrary, the
Imperial Regency  Of Intelligence and Security does not engage in "Black
Ops". Despite protestations of their legal counsel, IRIS categorically
refutes all charges made by Ctivey Iacqusen Simulations of Regina. These
baseless attempts to link recent criminal activities conducted against
their offices and livelihood with our agents are founded on paranoic
disinformation. This climate of paranioa and governmental distrust that
has pervaded the Spinward Marches. Experts at the Directorate of IRIS
and the Central Command of Imperial Naval Intelligence have determined
this to be a product of our Coreward interstellar neighbors. We deplore
the climate of fear and misapprehension resulting from these completely
unethical and undiplomatic activities. Citizens we must be vigilant! As
per our agency\'s motto "Custodiamus veritas":  We Guard the Truth, and
so should each and every one of you in the press and especially our
patriotic citizens at home.  <applause>

Thank You and Long Live the Emperor Strephon! <cheers>

I\'m sorry but due to a chronographical error we will not be able to take
questions at this time.

Ummmm, well maybe, but that would be one honking missile if you\'re

Whoa!  I think your formula is incorrect, doesn\'t V = AT?  I think
you are confusing it with the formula for distance travelled.

If you accelerate at 10m/s for 10 seconds you are travelling at
100m/s...right?

So, using your example of a 100g/turn acceleration we\'d have...

 V = 980 * 1200 = 1,176,000m/s = 1,176km/s = 0.0039c

...that\'s nice and fast, but approaching c...not quite!  To get up
*near* c you\'d have to accelerate at 100g for somewhat longer...like
almost 4 days.

Of course, I could be wrong here, but I\'m sure one of our more
gearheaded science folks will let us know.

Indeed. The URL is:

http://www.vision-forge-graphics.com/jesse/traveller/ditzie.htm

I find she reminds me of the daughter of a married couple I play Traveller
with. I have seen several other folks say she reminds them of their own
daughters or those of gaming friends.  Kinda scary, really...  ;)

My own daughters (8 y.o.) are the anti-Ditzies.

By the way, thanks for pointing me at this mailing list way back when...
I think.  ;)

Take care,

That\'s a problem I\'m aware of; but, I\'d like to keep the hazy look of

That\'s a really good idea and I\'ll think about it.  I might add it.
Does anyone know of a source for a transparent GIF of a compass 
outline?

Another really good idea.
Thanks for the great ideas.  It will be a few weeks before I can get
back to my VRMLing so if anyone has any pointers to useful GIFs I\'d
like to see them, but the need isn\'t urgent.

OOPS! ;->  Let me redo that.

It takes *5* to get through the 10 armor because the dart has a (2)
armor piercing multiplier.  This leaves 16 points of which the next
10 do damage to Joe and the last 6 hit the armor on the other side.
This should blow through the back armor as well.  Frankly, I wonder
if the dart shouldn\'t ricochet back into Joe doing more damage...

Suz, maybe I need to look at it again.  I just don\'t see what all
the fuss was about.  I mean, there wasn\'t anything obscene or
purient about the drawing.  It was just a good drawing of a late
teen, early twenties, fully-clothed, female human who happened to be
holding a *really big* gun.  Ok, so I can see the freudian
implications of the really big gun, but...?  All the hu-ha it
caused!  ;->

BTW, Nikki, if Suz and you...and others, would post more often, I
think, there would be less of the sort of thing to which you
objected.  I\'m sure the majority here would welcome your ideas.

Actually, what will a PDL accomplish?  While  (see below) my missile won\'t
be moving at an appreciable fraction of "C", at the velocities I have in
mind, my missile uses no terminal guidance or warhead...the only way to take
kinetic energy from my "warhead" is to vaporize it, and far enough from your
hull that a high-velocity plasma jet doesn\'t reach you.  Basically, only a
catostrophic hard kill does the trick.  Also, no sneaky nuclear dampners.

No, you\'re right.  Still, a good velocity, say 1000km/sec, obtainable by a
missile with a "mere" 30G in only one hour, would be:

a. Very, very hard to find- until within a second or two, the object\'s tiny
size means that it\'s apparent diameter is smaller than the resolution of any
ship-based sensor. It is also not emitting much, if anything.

b.  Hard to target.  It will be within range for a very, very short time
compared to conventional missiles and small craft.

c.  Enourmously deadly *IF* it hits.  I will leave the calculations of
energy imparted to those less astrophysically-challenged (I won\'t pretend to
remember the formula, this time).  The simple missile I built weighed in at
5.8 tons.  OTOH, terminal guidance was simple HARM, otherwise guidance was
command-control from firing ship. Great against slow abttlewagons, not so
great vs. fighters.

So can you tell me, IYTU does "IRIS" exists or not?

I ask because:

1.   The original article is specifically labelled as a "variant".

2.   _Survival Margin_ discredits the organisation (Strephon\'s comment
about "Maybe someone should explain the Moot to them").

3.   IMTU, "IRIS" (if I ever get that far) will actually be a section of
the IMOJ that breaks away from Lucan\'s control during the Rebellion. They
set themselves up in the Vegan Autonomous District, and proceed to make
their claims about validating Imperial heirs. For me, this gells with their
"history" as stated in the original article.

  The biggest difference was likely that in BNA there was a history of dealing
with the natives in a defined legal relationship (in no small part due to the
fact that they were strong enough to make conducting business unprofitable and
/or really helpful in squashing frogs or limeys, depending on what scenario
was being played at the time) - so the East was mostly the site of normalized
(if not thoroughly fair) relations, and although there was no pressing need to
be very nice to anyone out West the habit was sort of ingrained - even the NW
Rebellion and various incidents in BC were resolved with fairly low body counts.

  ObTrav: the obvious wrt newly discovered worlds. Also, it begs the question
of why the 3I treated the Solomani the way they did circa 700-900 - was the
Imperium being nice and acceding to legitimate demands, or were they being 
weak? Of course, the Party view wouldn\'t even start with conceding decent
treatment, but how that gets related to being given extensive autonomy which
gets used to carve out an empire and oppress others is beyond me.

Black Ops vs. Special Forces:  In my Traveller universe, these terms
implicate different issues.  I\'ll only talk about the Imperium here, but
certainly the other major and minor powers have special forces and
engage in black ops, too.  

Special forces are elite units capable of carrying out unusual missions
beyond normal supply.  Each uniformed service has special forces.  

Black operations are unconventional warfare operations which may or may
not be carried out by special forces, and which may or may not be
carried out during wartime.  These include espionage, recruitment and
subornation, various psychological and quasi-commando operations to
destabilize another power, and the like.  

The Imperial Army\'s special forces are used in much the same way as the
contemporary Green Berets -- to support and train Imperial allies who
need help, and sometimes to to perform commando operations (jump drops,
seizure of critical installations, etc.).  

The Imperial Marines are almost a special force unto themselves.  Marine
special forces perform commando operations, as well as some "black
operations" like kidnapping and assassination (especially military and
civilian leaders of powers with whom the Imperium is at war), capturing
(as opposed to just destroying) technology and information, and
escorting spy insertions and extractions.

The Imperial Navy\'s special forces consist of ships with special forces
missions, like long range jump troop transports, ships committed to the
communication / surveillance / jamming role, small intruders for
insertions and extractions, etc.

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service has special forces consisting of
ship organizations and personnel organizations.  The ships perform
missions to similar to those of the Navy.  The personnel engage in some
support and training of Imperial allies, and perform black ops similar
to the Marines; they tend not to be used for commando operations. (There
is a considerable rivalry among the various special forces, as one might
expect.)

I don\'t know if canonical sources addressing special forces and black
operations exist. I think Book 4: Mercenary and Book 6: Scouts address
some of these issues.  

For some thoughts about Zhodani special forces, see Paranoia Press\'
excellent book SORAG, which is long out of print.

His Grace makes an important point.  Certainly the Imperium has stated
that its policy is that it spies on friends and foes alike, and believes
that its spies will not be found.  The Imperium is also quite above
board in letting friends and foes know that it will hunt down and turn
the spies of its friends and foes alike -- or imprison or kill them if
they can\'t be turned.  When it announces the capture of a spy, the
Imperium will never state that it is shocked by the behavior -- after
all, powers must spy on one another.  Treason is the offense that shocks
the conscience of an Imperial citizen.

In wartime, the Imperium makes no secret of its intention to and its
belief in its ability to destroy its enemies totally by any and all
means necessary -- including political destabilization, disruption of
military and civil communications, ruses de guerre, etc. The Imperium
does not lie to its enemies.  It truthfully states, we shall lie to you
until you yield, and you won\'t know when we\'re telling the truth and
when we\'re lying.

Well, it depends, I guess.  If the Imperium decided that the world would
be of greater benefit to the Imperium if it were interdicted for a
while, then it would interdict.  If it was in the Imperium\'s interest to
get the world into the Imperium right away -- maybe because of strategic
location or resources -- then it would probably just move in.  

Even in the latter case, I don\'t think that the Imperium would
necessarily invade in a big military way.  It would more likely just
"settle" some "interstellar trade personnel" on the planet, and maybe
some "colonists" later.  It would be sure to get "concessions" from "the
recognized, legitimate, government", allowing construction of a
starport, and the settlements noted.

Then when the local xenophobes "threatened the security" of the
"interstellar trade personnel and colonists", the Imperials on the
ground would ask the Imperial Marines to intervene to "protect Imperial
citizens and property."  This would likely involve some demonstrations
of force that would encourage "the recognized, legitimate, government"
to grant more concessions.

Meanwhile, of course, the real game is being played on the holovid and
in the streets.  The "interstellar trade personnel" are broadcasting
advertising of products just a step or two above the local tech level,
along with dramatic and documentary programming whose basic message is,
"gee, it\'s cool to be an Imperial citizen!"  The "colonists" are highly
visible, and living visibly great lives.  Eventually the local kids at
least will start demanding advertised toys, clothes, etc., and that
culture will largely disappear, only to be remembered by anthropologists
and historians.

Unfortunately, the _majority_ of this is caused, IMO, by the fact that some

	This reminds me of the main reason I do not find the official 
universe all that useful for my IMTU. The above can be easily argued 
in favor, in the Third Imperium, for worlds within its boundaries. 
Probably there is an "Imperial Rules of Colonization" document...

	..but the main area of play in MTU is far away from the Imperium, 
and the largest polity encompasses the fantastic quantity of 32 
worlds... so, almost any colonization effort would be outside its 
boundaries.

	So, this polity (the Federation) might have a policy regarding 
colonization of worlds, but, will this policy be accepted by their 
neighbours?

	For that matter, this is an important question in M:0. Say the 
Imperium recognizes the rights of a group of colonists over a world, 
but the nearest pocket empire suddenly decides that it is interested 
in that world... in fact, <ehem>, the historical documents of this 
empire *prove* <ehem> that he world has been claimend for over a 
century...

	For that matter, a world is a very big place. What happens if two 
different groups settle on different continents and claim 
colonization rights?
	Within the Imperium, probably not much. The world is now balkanized, 
hop.
	Outside the Imperium, what happens if each of the groups gets 
colonization rights from different interstellar states? Will a war 
erupt? Yes, of course, it depends, but let\'s assume it is that M:0 
situation. Will the early 3I go to war with a Pocket Empire to 
guarantee that *its* colonists get the whole world? Will they send 
the marines? Or will they negotiate? Makes for some interesting world 
hooks...

	Now that I stop to think about it, what about *half* a world 
belonging to the 3I, the other half to a pocket empire? The result of 
a failed negotiation attempt...

Are you sure that the Homestead act required occupancy?  My parents
picked up 10 or 12 acres of lakefront land for free (but had to pay 
surveyors costs) in the late 70\'s before the program ended.  Maybe they
qualified under a smiliar state (of Alaska) program.  They never had to
build anything on the property & have not set foot on it in 15 or 20
years.

ObTrav:  There is a lot of land out there.  Even thoough most planets
are smaller then Earth most of them have less than a million people on
them.  There should be lots of good unused land available.  On some
planets it may well be "free" on others it may cost between a few
credits and a thousand credits per hectare.

OTOH: This means that the Aslan Second Sons should be able to pick up
land for pocket change, which is not generally the case in canon.

The coil gun has the projectile reacting to an EM field generated by
several sets of coils. So the forces are exerted on the coils, and
worse, upon only a couple of sets at any given moment. That means the
coils need some heavy bracing.

A rail gun has a magnet (or rather, a pair of magnets) and a pair of
conducting rails. The structure is inherently simpler, and only part of
the force is on the magnets.

No, that\'d be drain cleaner and bleach. No need for the sugar. 

Most non-lye drain cleaners seem to be hydrochloric acid. Allow the
*vapors* from HCl and ammonia to mix, and they\'ll form a fine white
"smoke". This is fine particles of solid ammonium chloride. 

My "guess" is that ammonium chloride is a sufficiently good oxidizer to
make a good combo with sugar. (The normal version of this is done with
sodium or potassium nitrate and sugar).

Your problem is simple. The formula is V=AT. You got it confused with
D=.5AT^2. 

A 100 g missile accelerating for 20 minutes reaches:
	V=9.8*100*20*60=1,176,000 m/s 
or about .4% of c.

You\'ve got a *major* miscalculation in there somewhere. The speed of
light is approximately one "g-year". So it should take about 1/30th of a
year at 30 g to reach c (ignoring relativity). That\'s 20 *days*. 

Keep in mind that we have already *built* rockets that did over 100 g
for multiple seconds. I\'m still tryying to get more exact figures, but
the Sprint interceptor was capable of hitting orbital altitude in a
few seconds, and darn near reaching escape velocity.

Yes but as these landless sons are aslan males and are dealing with humans
they\'re probably swindled with extreme markups. This may actually be the
reason why the humans seem to hate the aslans so much; they don\'t dislike
the aslans so much as they dislike those getting filthy rich by selling
cheap land for a fortune.

A while back someone (I apologize for forgetting who, but I don\'t have

experience for pilots: what rolls were needed at what character skill 
levels and what actions did not need to be rolled for.

I was wondering if anyone had already created a list or might have ideas 
regarding the consequences of failing piloting rolls.  Is there something 
written in canon already or does anyone have a homebrew table.

F.I., what happens if the pilot is attempting to dock with a ship and 
misses his roll by one, by two, etc.?

Perhaps a general guideline for "level of disaster" versus amount of 
failure?

Any information or pointers in the correct direction would be appreciated.

I\'m wondering what the ramifications of such a weapon would be in terms
of fleet design philosophies.

Take HG, add a weapon that will kill a very large or low-agility target almost
every time. The only defenses against it are high agility, or the ability to
keep the firing unit from getting into range. Add that this weapon can be
fired from a very small ship. 

We have the WW2 air-dropped torpedo from hell, with the addition that
capital ships can use them on each other. Space combat becomes a lot
shorter, and a lot deadlier. The ships get tiny - why build a 5000tn
spinal mount when you can wax an enemy battlecruiser with a 100tn
missile bay? Heck, a 30tn fighter might be big enough.

Quite a difference.

BTW, a note on my High Guard work. Someone was mentioning how
ridiculous it was that a fighter squadron could slow down a battleship for
a turn. Note that in High Guard\'s original rules, one 400tn SDB can stop
twenty Dreadnaughts in their tracks, for as long as it takes them to kill
it. My rule ideas would make one dreadnaught hunt down the SDB, while
the others got to play with other targets.

In my own games, I attribute a certain amount of "automatic success" to
pilots of a given skill level. For instance, I don\'t think someone with
pilot-4 should have to roll for a routine docking. They\'re so highly
trained that they could do that in their sleep. Given extenuating
circumstances (under fire, thruster damaged, etc.) they would have to
roll.

I don\'t even see that much of a problem with one plasma gun, just in case.
Even Coast Toasties have MGs and larger deck guns.  I don\'t see a Scout team
carrying the MPPG regularly, but to have as a backup, to cover the
retreating team when everything drops in the pot, might be a good idea.

However, if it is ever needed, you can bet that Scout HQ will have words for
that team...

Good question. When something leaves the jump-field, does it precipitate
into normal space (probably thoroughly reduced to teeny-tiny component
particles) or does it simply "vanish"?

Any examples or discussion in "official" works (whatever that can be
construed to mean for Traveller these days!)?

I think a fair consensus would be that in general point defence lasers
do beat most kinetic-kill missiles (with the possible exception of 
huge, expensive missiles that deploy submunitions at quite long ranges),
and that (b) this isn\'t a bad thing, because missiles that can disable
battleships with a single hit are hardly Traveller canon.

The missile probably does need some kind of terminal guidance and 
maneuver capability - if the missile goes ballistic even 30 seconds
out (one BL hex, quite short range) a 4-G battleship target has enough
time to move itself ~2 km away from where the missile is going to hit.
So the missile needs some kind of sensor or commo and some kind of
maneuver capability, which makes it vulnerable to lasers.

Sensors can detect things smaller than their resolution. (Your eye can
detect a star, which is much, much, much smaller than the resolution
of your eye.) Also, as long as the missile is maneuvering with a fusion
rocket it is incredibly easy to detect - you can see it halfway 
across the solar system. So you can follow it until it shuts down its
engine at (say) 30 seconds out then (see above) it\'ll just miss.
If it shuts down its engine at 1 second out it might hit but will be
well within laser engagement range. Finally, even with the engine off,
if you get a lock on it while it\'s still firing you can track it with
LIDAR or similar sensors.

>b.  Hard to target.  It will be within range for a very, very short time
>compared to conventional missiles and small craft.
Laser weapons can be astonishingly accurate. See the archived discussion
for details, but laser beams basically go where you point them with an
intrinsic error of a few nanoradian - about 1 cm at 10,000 km. The only
way not to get hit by a laser beam is to dodge in the time it takes the
laser beam to travel to you. For a missile to be able to dodge, it 
needs to keep accelerating (making it easy to detect) - if it goes
ballistic at even thirty thousand km the laser is guaranteed a hit
less than a second later.
Unfortunately for missiles, the size of
your "dodge radius" goes as range^2 (and only linearly with accel.) 
So a high-acceleration missile at very close range is actually easier
to hit than a battleship at long range. This means that even if the
missile keeps evading all the way to impact, once it\'s within about
5000 km it can\'t evade fast enough and the point defence laser is
guaranteed a hit (and has five whole seconds before the missile hits.)
One can (under FFS1) design lasers with really ludicrous rates of
fire that can catch a dozen missiles in this time. (I can post my
favourite, the BAMTech CSN/RT, if I can dig it up.)

>c.  Enourmously deadly *IF* it hits. 
This part is true, which is why we have to stop them.

If they will give a scout ship to a person, I don\'t see a problem with them
giving an ACR to someone. However, IMTU, any weapon given as a mustering out
benefit is engraved, decorated, etc with the servicemembers name, rank,
units, \'best wishes\', etc that no one would ever consider using it in a real
fight unless it was the only weapon available.

Of course, if the weapon is used in a crime, it also make it easier for the
LEOs to track down the offender.

"Gosh, Officer - then this guy with this really ornate ACR opened
fire...looked like the same model I used in the Marines, except for all the
engraving."

Maybe tossing things out the airlock will have no effect on it, maybe your
ship vanishes forever - this is not an experiment a ship crew will allow
you to perform.

Since ships destroyed while in jump space leave no wreckage to investigate
and no flight recorders, all kinds of myths and conjectures exist as to 
what happened. Many of these ideas caught on, and form a kind of SOP
for starship crews. One of the most common ones is "don\'t mess with
the jump field, even a little bit".

I have sed IRIS since it was published.  I see it as a combination of MJ-12
and the darker aspects of FEMA.  Basicly, even those who have oversight or
hold the pursestrings never knew the scope or true charter IRIS operated under.

In most cases, they are neither good nor bad, just committed to their own
secret plans.  Actually, in one of the campaigns I was in they engineered a
hit on a peace meeting between a moderate faction of the Solomani
Confederation and the Fed of Daibei (sp?).  In the next few months
cooperation between the Solomani and Federation became much tighter as each
group tried to track down who they thought casued the assassination
attempt.  In the end, this caused the downfall of the extremists in the
Solomani Confederation and a cooperation treaty between the two polities.  

By the late 1100\'s (TNE had yet to be published), the newly created Rim
Republic had gone a long way to restoring peace and prosperity to the war
ravaged rim sectors.

I miss that campaign.

I am very saddened that Rob Prior left. However, that is not what bothers
me most about the entire affair.

It is entirely likely that Clif suffered from a personality disorder of
some type (my guess would be Borderline Personality Disorder).

He certainly tended towards abusiveness, but this does not excuse the many
abusive things said right back at him *on list.* This should have been
taken to private email (for those who want to argue with those who are most
likely mentally ill) *or* taken up with Rob Miracle (in the form of
requests to to have Clif removed from the list).

IMO, those that argued with Clif most vehemently were *worse* than Clif --
I was offended more by the well-thought-out, unpleasant things written (and
now, it seems, drawn) by certain others than the childish outbursts Clif
made.

IIRC, one poster even went so far as to bring up the possibility of Clif
being mentally unstable, then went right on berating him. This is, IMO,
akin to going up to a guy with schizophrenia on a street corner somewhere
and poking him with a stick because his ravings irritate you.

Clif was very difficult to get along with. He was abusive, short tempered,
paranoid, and ignored (or didn\'t understand) any advice given to him on how
to conduct himself in a social setting like this mailing list.

But still ...

ObTrav (\'cause that is what this list is really about): Mental health in
the future. Some current theory holds that many of the most serious
psychological disorders are rooted in physiological breakdowns influenced
by many factors. Environmental stresses, genetic predisposition, bacterial
or viral infection, chemical poisoning, and even persistant illogical
thinking seem to have the ability to adversely affect the brain in such a
way as to cause a range of mental illnesses. Advanced technology might be
able to identify and correct many of these problems -- in fact, high tech
therapy might actually be able to make changes to the "hardware/software"
of the brain/mind interaction to both positive and negative results.

At what tech level does mental illness become a thing of the past? How
expensive is it? What are the ethical questions involved? What happens when
a high-tech society decides that certain traits -- traits that we might
consider "individual" -- are actually disorders that need to be treated? It
doesn\'t have to be something so blatant or Orwellian as "mind-stapling"
people to make them passive drones, either.

Sufficiently advanced techonology might even be able to affect mental
capacity. What would it be like to visit a world where everyone had an INT
of F?

IIRC, someone on the list (Robert?) wrote a piece on psychology at future
tech levels. Is this still in electronic form somewhere where I might get
at it? I can\'t seem to find it on my hard disk. :-(

First of all, Suz and Nikki, it\'s so nice to hear from
the both of you; I\'d thought you all had left the list.
Glad to hear you haven\'t.

Secondly, I\'m trying to find all the issues in the
GURPS engine which can affect a G:T game. Examples are
the effectiveness of point defense lasers vs. missiles,
the effectiveness of missiles in general, effective
use of fighter-type craft (if any), "double-booking",
etc.

I\'ve already made a great deal of headway in IDing all
the advantages/disadvantages/skills I *don\'t* want to
use. I\'m looking more for rules engine issues rather
than Traveller background issues.

Does anyone on the list know of any websites (other than
SJG and GURPSNet) which ID\'s/deals with these issues?
Basically, I\'m looking for someone who has already done
the work rather than wading through 3 years of posts;
I\'ve been tweaking Traveller rules since 1979 and I
admit to getting a little tired of it (one of the
reasons G:T will be the last set of Traveller rules I
learn).

Oh, one more thing..has anyone figured out why GURPS uses
armor PD in addition to DR rather than just DR? It seems
that PD is just an unnecessary complication. (YMMV)

Truly.  Consider the fate of the Meso-American nations when faced with the
Spanish technological superiority.  Or any case where on side has an
overwhelming advantage in population or technology.  Most of the time, that
side will win.

Esalin/Jewell was co-owned by the Zhodani and the Imperium after the 4FW.
Each side had forces on the planet limited to the local TL, and port of
call rights.  Made for an interesting place to visit.  Especially when an
Imperial and Zhodani flotilla were making courtesy calls at the same time..
(cf: "The Trouble With Tribbles" bar fight sequence.)

Negotiate first.  But hold the negotiations onboard a Coronation class
battleship.  Let them know what the are facing.  If you go with the "Ugly
Sylean" school of thought for M:0, the Imperium *wants* to promote conflict
when it hits a multi-world polity.  Makes it easier to absorb the remains.

Since the bubble is protecting you from jump space, I\'d imagine that what
passes throught the field enters the jump dimension.

I\'d also assume that dumping soldi matter through the field might be a very
bad thing.

In CORPS (plug, plug) if a task\'s difficulty is lower than the character\'s
skill, success is automatic, no need to roll.

Taking the example given, missing the roll by only one or two might result
in the ship coming in a little hard, or the task taking longer because of
the need to fine tune the approach.  Watch videos of the shuttle docking
with Mir for ideas.

No.  According to canon, the Moot is responsible for determining the

I like the theory (forgot who put it forward) that IRIS was a construct of

One memorable session the PCs decieded to get even with one of the other
PCs in the group.  While he was sleeping in a hotel room, the entered his
room, emptied several magazines of gauss pistol ammo into his sleeping
form, then loaded everything in the room onto a waiting grav van, replaced
all the fittings with new furnishings unloaded from grav van #2, then made
a bee-line for their ship waiting for them.  Once in J-space, they dumped
both grav vans.

Hrm.  No, more likely I\'m just forgetful, I was assuming APS rounds.  In any
case, blowthrough still limits damage to 10 pts, though this means that brain

Hm..I never read it as optional.  Max is HT for bullets (different for other

Actually, it\'s not; that\'s roughly equivalent to TL 8 light concealable armor

Remulak (SolRim 1833)
E974573-4
Population: 400,000

Over a span of 14 years, the United Nations exported over 110 million 
people to the mainworlds of these systems, and this doesn\'t include 
the other worlds occupied during this time period either.

Good ol\' Cats&Rats talks of a Terran initiative taken during the
early parts of the wars to send out colony ships that raised 20,000
people in creches onsite, and populated a world very quickly.  I
think that Hephaistos reflects the first experiments in that
direction.  (Note the high TL, the correct population, and its the
only Corporate government type in the whole list.)  The rest are
colonies, or started that way.

So, how big should a TL 9 colony ship be that was used to populate 
these worlds?  (All of them are primarily first generation settlers, 
so they\'ve been moved in.)  Perhaps a third of the numbers listed 
came from enhanced fertility and such, promoted by the UNSC to get 
the Terran numbers up against their huge enemy.  That\'s still 70 
million that need to be moved.

Did the colony ships hold settlers in the range of a thousand a trip? 
 10,000 a trip?  20K?  50K?  100K?  If so, were they all under Cold 
Sleep, to reduce environmental conditions and strains?  (Was Cold 
Sleep available at TL 9?)

So here\'s the request:

I\'d like to exchange some thoughts on the design philosophy of a TL 9 
Colony Ship.  It is limited to Jump 1, and probably carries enough 
fuel to make two jumps without refueling.  Maneuver drives can be 
kept at 1G.  How big should it be?  How many colonists would be 
transported, and how?  Any thoughts or suggestions would be 
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

IMHO anything of a given size (molecules ? bullets ? stones ?
plasma-jets ?  - take whatever you think to be appropriate) or
energy-density (laserbeams ?) touching the jump-field will disturb it,
thus causing a (major ?) misjump.

Maybe the breakdown of the jumpfield while in jump (being a _really
major_ jumpdrive failure), or leaving the jumpfield results in the
immediate return of the ship (or whatever) in normal space, usually
spread out over a sphere with a diameter of several parsec. This might
qualify as *vanishing forever*.


Bye the way, why dumping annoying things like corpses in jump-space.
Dump it while conducting gasgiant refueling. I doubt anyone will find
anything dumped into a gg.

I\'d like to post some notes on some of the various worlds involved in 
the Andrew M-V\'s Prometheus Rising data, at the time of the 1st 
Interstellar War.  Your input would be greatly appreciated.

Barnard/Ikugi (SolRim 1926)
E200472-A
Population: 30,000

At the time of the Barnard Incident, the world of Barnard (Ikugi to
the Vilani) is divided into the Sharushiid Complex (pop. 10,000),
under Vilani rule, and three UN colonies (combined pop. 21,000). 
The people of the UN colonies are divided in Pro-Vilani/Anti-Vilani
sentiment, until the Cantebury is destroyed by a Vilani vessel. 
This incident galvanizes the population of the UN against the
Vilani, and launches the First Interstellar War.

Prometheus (SolRim 2027)
C785763-6
Population: 90 million

The second planet to be colonized, following the Barnard Colony, 
the Prometheus Colony recently celebrated its Tenth Year Anniversary.

Fenris (SolRim 1830)
DA98668-4
Population: 5 million

Fenris is a jungle world, protected by pollens that hyperactivates 
most Terran immune responses, sending unprotected humans into 
anaphylactic shock and death.  The world is also home to its own 
indeginous lifeforms.  Several companies lead hunting safaris into 
the wilds around the colonies, making Fenris the latest recreation 
site among Terran nobility.

Hephaistos (SolRim 1931)
D930418-9
Population: 20,000

"The Company," a European corporate conglomerate, has obtained the
rights to perform a colonization test program involving creche
births on the world of Hephaistos.  If successful, the system will
be utilized to help colonize many worlds to Rimward of Terra, in an
effort to insure the survival of the Terran race.  A majority of the
population are in their early teens, and are currently undergoing
deep education/training, based off of similar methods used in
military eugenics programs in the late 2000\'s in the Terran system.

Remulak (SolRim 1833)
E974573-4
Population: 400,000

Remulak contains the hold-overs from an attempt by several Navy 
captains to form a pocket empire to rimward of Terra and the Ziru 
Sirka.  Although the rebellion was put down two years ago, the 
population rejected UN rule, and began attracting all manners of 
political malcontents.  After the Vilani situation is taken care of, 
the UNSC is determined to resolve this issue.  Until then, the planet 
is kept under tight surveillance.

Thank you very much for your time,

There is. Supposedly, PD is the ability of the armor to shrug off an attack
and represents the amount of damage the armor *always* protects
against even when the target is surprised, unconscious, etc.

My understanding (assumption) of armor is if it\'s between you and
an attack, it protects. The Dex advantage in ADnD represents a
character\'s ability to dodge an attack which is something completely
different. GURPS already separates the Dodge capability from amor
damage absorption/negation.

Now you know why I\'m confused. I\'ll probably just ignore any PD ratings
and just stick with an armor\'s DR.

Oh my, yes! I shelled out over $100 US for all the

	IMTU no field is required to stay in jump space, rather you
	stay there due to 4th dimensional inertia. Thus, anything 
	ejected from the ship will share that inertia and will
	harmlessly continue through jump space until dropping out 
	(probably about the same time that you do). Because jump

and decided that ALL major actions needed to be rolled. THe reason is
Critical Success and Critical Failure. Even though a character could
normally automatically succeed at a task if a critical was rolled it
still counted. The same was true of a critical success, if the character
would normally fail, a critical roll could cause a success. I did modify
this, slightly however, if a critical is rolled in the above cases (i.e.
normal automatic failure or success) the result become a NORMAL success
or failure.

How I handle the results varies for the situation. When writing an
adventure I only list MAJOR tasks (things like flying an air raft in a
storm, or hacking a secured database, etc.) and then list both normal
failure and critical failure for the task. For example, in hacking a
secured database, the normal failure would be just not geing able to
gain access, while a critical failure would be the triggering of an
alarm.

In general I try to think of a critical failure as "double the trouble"
of a normal failure. Likewise a critical success usually has some
benefit, again refering to the above example, such as finding a link to
a second hidden info file.

Actually, what PD represents is the tendency of armor to deflect hits (if they
come in at a poor angle), rather than absorbing them.  I don\'t necessarily
agree with how GURPS handles PD, but that\'s what it supposely represents.

I\'m happy to see plaintext ships on the list. They don\'t take up as much

Add one constraint - the weapon has very short range compared with the
main armament on the heavies- far, far less than the meson
guns/PAW/Lasers - i.e. you have to survive closing to point-blank range
to fire it.

With the modification above, there is now a justification for fighters.
Big ships probably aren\'t going to risk closing (since the enemy big
ship might fire one of these weapons back at you); but lobbing in a
squadron or two of fighters? Sure.

OTOH, if all you build are small craft with this weapon, the enemy is
going to build a few bigger ships that can toast you at range - so you
need a balanced fleet.

PD as an advantage seems to me to have a different rationale than armor
PD, but with the same effect- it\'s either some intrinsic ability to
avoid blows (like the Truul in GURPS Aliens), or hyper-reflexes, or
mystic force fields, or something else normal humans can\'t have. It can
also be plain old armor if you\'re building a robot or cybered
character. But I think in Traveller you won\'t see PD (or Enhanced Dodge)
as a PC advantage without a terribly generous GM...

I\'ve always taken armor PD to represent the ability of armor to \'turn\' a
blow, so it never strikes squarely enough to do damage at all. The PD
number is added to the active defense since they work together to avoid
attacks (i.e. if you dodge a little, your armor can cause the blow/shot
to glance off, but you\'d have been damaged without armor). It\'s what
makes plate armor better than an equivalent weight of chain. (p.71-72 in
the main GURPS book)

If you leave PD off of armor, defense rolls will become much harder to
make and GURPS combat will get even deadlier; maybe this is what you
want though. :) There are probably other balance issues with PD that I
can\'t think of right offhand.

Interesting encounter: The AE-35 antennae on the ship\'s exterior is giving
an indication that its structural brace has fractured. If it breaks loose
and contacts the jump field, it could be "bad." (imagine all life as we
know it ceasing to exist and every molecule in your body exploding at the

One of the PCs has to spacewalk on the outside of the ship, clinging to
the hull so as not to contact the jump field himself, and secure the
antennae.

And you thought engineering was a safe profession!

I think a colony ship shouldn\'t be too large, and should have coldsleep of some
kind for best value.  A 10,000 ton J1 ship could have
6000+ tons free for low berths.  Using something like emergency
low berths (4 people per dton), 25,000 people could be squeezed
into a ship.  Make 4 round trips a year and you have 100,000 people
moved in one year.  Have 10 such ships and you have 1 million
people, per year.

Probably a safer way is to have a fleet of 1000-ton cold-sleep ships;
say, a few hundred of them, with 2000-2500 peoplesicles per ship.
This way, a hundred different interests can launch colony ships, from
nations, large corporations, and various agencies.

as explained in the rules. PD represents the armor\'s tendency to deflect
attacks completely; an armor with a high PD, when struck, is more likely to
bounce the attack completely. The PD is added to the defense roll of the
character. Without it, defense rolls would be made far less often, and
characters would die more often. DR, or Damage Resistance, is the number of
points of damage the armor absorbs when it is hit.

Rather than a needless complication, PD is in fact an integral part of the
defense/damage system that makes GURPS my preferred system for any genre
involving hand-to-hand combat. There are rules in High-Tech for reducing PD
to account for high-velocity bullets (thus making them harder to dodge), and
the GM is always free to say that a particular attack cannot be dodged (such
as lasers). Myself, I just let \'em do it anyway; GURPS is lethal enough that
I figure the characters need all the breaks they can get.

Ayup! That fusion gun is gonna be a mighty big string tying that

he can walk into Joes Sporting Goods and ask for a box of fusion gun

  Even in second edition HG a single vessel can be placed in the line such
enemy units may only fire at that one vessel and not any Reserve/Screened
units; the big difference from first ed. is that in 2ed the recognition is
made that both lines are clearly in effective range of all units in each 
battle-line.

  If such were to be gamed out a la Mayday (an old Dragon/Aries article made
a decent start on this) then clearly a ship _could_ not be rendered unable
to move; at best a ship could be prevented from moving through the hex of a
hostile vessel able to fire weapons capable of inflicting meaningful damage.
This reflects nicely the implications of going too close to a laser-armed
ship and being subject to near auto hits in near-ROF quantities (!); the best
way of handling this would be akin to Star Cruiser/2300 AD\'s overrun rules -
upon entering an enemy hex (or vice versa) all beams involved get to resolve
an additional combat phase at normal hit opportunities, without losing their
normal extended range combat phase later in the turn sequence.

  Did you ever clarify how in your proposed pseudo-Imperium adaptation
it was that a fighter squadron managed to operate as a coherent unit
yet a pair of cruisers seemed to be doomed to wander about randomly?

  FWIW, under the restrictions you seemed to be placing on co-ordinated
ops how would the optional Escort rules you posted be able to be used?

This was a MT version of the FGMP-15.  With the grav compensator and
backpack.  The only reloads it needs is eiter a ships powerplant or refined
fuel.  His motto later in the campaign was "Have water, will blast!"

We were contracted quite a bit for cross border "trade".  ;-)

We know from old TNS reports that someone has survived exposure to 
Jump Space (more than half of him anyway), and the ship returned to 
normal space intact.  Nothing further came of that news entry, to my 
knowledge.

Therefore, I would assume that chunking stuff into Jump Space doesn\'t 
destroy the ship, at least in the OTU.  Perhaps it depends on the 
mass that\'s dropped into J-Space.  If it\'s sufficient to change the 
gravitational moment by a significant amount (which varies from GM to 
GM), then the Jump field becomes unstable and the ship undergoes a 
misjump.

Suggestion:  For every unit of mass (say 1/1000th of the vehicle\'s
mass) ejected into J-space, impose a DM-1 on the original navigation
roll used to take the ship into J-space.  If the new result would
lead to a misjump, resolve as a misjump. The more penalties
accumulated, the more dangerous the misjump should be.

Alternatively, start with a particular mass, and modify the roll
based on orders of magnitude.  For example, at 1 X 10^-6
(1/1,000,000), the DM is -1.  At 1 X 10^-5 the DM is -2, and so on,
until we reach 10% of the vessel\'s mass, which imposes DM-5.  Beyond
10%, the Jump field integrity is violated, and the ship goes through
a horrible misjump or is most likely destroyed.

It\'s a starting point for a thought, anyway.

hmmm...

Since the (mostly) accepted handwave is that the H2 fuel is used to maintain
a field of N-space around the ship - one that is slowly destroyed by contact
with J-space (hence the need to replentish it over the span of the jump), I
would think that dumping the garbage would cause a slight, but detectable
warpage of the J-field.  Because it did not occur as the field was formed,
it would not result in a major misjump (unless a catastrophic failure was
rolled), but would result in a minor course error.

Of course, minor is relative!  ;)

If it happened in MTU, I would probably double the error factor for the
target system emergance point.

Let\'s see, catastrophic failures could be:

- - Whatever was being dumped serves as a \'conductor\' for J-space energy,
resulting in a breach of the J-field (and J-space sickness for anyone in the
area).

- - Garbage ejection opens both interior and exterior doors simultaneously -
explosive decompression begins NOW!

- - The JumpSpace dragon was waiting

- - Has anyone seen George since he went to dump the garbage yesterday?

Bingo!  In VRML, you would put all the parts into a group

This reflects nicely the implications of going too close to a laser-armed

I think we\'re trying to push too much direct simulation onto the abstraction

When it comes to vehicular combat, PD could probably be safely
ignored, especially considering the fact that GURPS has rules for
reduction of PD when using a high damage value weapon.

PD improves the ability of a target to dodge (or otherwise avoid
damage from) an attack. DR improves the ability of a target to absorb
an attack without taking damage. This could be important if you worry
about things like armor taking damage and such (this becomes an issue
in vehicular combat with ablative armor).

I would say that it\'s probably not a good idea to ignore PD in
non-vehicular combat, because people are going to get hit more often,
and GURPS combat is already deadly enough as is...

I would also avoid comparisons to D&D, as this will probably tend to
confuse you more. Just remember that PD helps avoid an attack and DR
helps absorb an attack.

IMTU (where one of Ewan\'s characters lives, btw ;-) ), ejecting 
garbage in jumpspace is not a problem. Opening a door to do it *is* a 
problem, since you break the lanthanum grid and, basically, jumpspace 
pushes in, with an unpredictable effect... it might swallow the 
character who was trying to dump the garbage. And it will probably 
affect the jump.

In principle, it could be easy to dump (jump?) garbage in jumpspace. 

Just have a chamber with lanthanum grid in the inside and the 
outside. Put the garbage there, open it, and let jumpspace swallow 
the garbage. However, it might affect the jump in an unpredictable 
way... maybe you end up 1 million km away from your destination, 
maybe it takes a day more.

Nice, but I kinda like keeping the vessel size down, due to the 
length of time it takes to build larger vessels, and the various 
nations would want to stake their claims as quickly as possible.

I like this idea.  This makes them approximately a quarter of the 
carrying capacity of the ESA Long-Range Colony ships launched in 
2049, but with the ability to quickly return to our homeworld and 
carry more people out into space.  Practically we looking at little 
more than six round trips a year per vessel, but we\'d also see more 
vessels being constructed by a wider range of interests, which also 
covers the multitude of diverse cultures which fled to the stars, 
based on historical/world references from OTU canon.

Now to test this thought.  Prometheus was probably not settled until
2098 at the earliest, although I personally project the time to be
around late 2099 before colonization started in earnest.  The
population by 2010 is projected at 90 million (using Andrew M-V\'s
data), and we assume that a max of a third of that can be second
generation.  Then, we need to account for the movement of a minimum
of 60 million to Prometheus.  At 2500 per trip, that\'s 24000
vessel-trips.  Each round trip lasts a minimum of 32 days (4 J1
jumps with a two day loading and unloading time at each end, and
that\'s pushing it.)  One vessel could theoretically make eleven
round trips a year. Taking into account annual maintenance, and we
end up with ten round trips a year, roughly.  That\'s a minimum of
2400 ships running people non-stop to Prometheus over a ten year
time period.  (Or, if we look at the 10Kton Colony ships, it still 
takes 240 of them to cover the same situation.)  This doesn\'t take 
into account misjumps, which will eat a portion of the ships over the 
course of (24000 X 4=) 96000 jumps.

I like the concept of the 1000ton Colony ships, but we may have to
consider some much larger mega-colony ships to reduce the number of
vessels required to a realistic number.  We only need a relative few
of these mega-colony ships, though, with a swarm of 1000ton Colony 
vessels to spread the Terran race to the stars.

Assuming that they can still fly it around the planet a bit (or
otherwise transport it), I\'d say the best place would someplace like
Greenland or Antarctica. Snow & ice won\'t do too much to a ship, and the
cold will help preserve things. 

For that matter, Antarctica has these "dry valleys". Areas of bare rock
& gravel where it hasn\'t rained or snowed for thousands of years.
They\'d be a *really* good place. Cold, dry, not anywhere *near*
primitives. 

The next best thing would be in lake far enough north or south. One
where the lower waters stay at 4C all year round. These waters will be
*very* depleted in oxygen. Not much in the way of fish or marine life
except for anaerobic micro-organisms.[1]

At, say, 100 ft (30 m) the pressure won\'t be that bad, but the ship
ship will be safe enough, and again the cold will help preserve it. The
lack of oxygen will help preserve the ship.

Tar pits would rank pretty low on my list. The tar, being a mix of all
sorts of petroleum type compounds is actually *more* likely to break
down seals. After all, it\'s got stuff like naptha in it. 

An old standby is to dig a cave, move the ship in, and seal it off. A
nice variant would be to get the local neolithic culture to raise a
"burial mound" over it. With only a bit of help from the party (in
cutting and selecting the larger pieces of stone) they could do it. 

Heck, teach them about the arch and the dome, maybe even the geodesic
dome. Build a stone dome over the ship, built of keyed triangular
pieces of stone. Then bury that under several feet of dirt.

[1] Lake Superior is such a lake. There\'s a line in "Wreck of the
Edmund Fitzgerald" about "Superior never gives up her dead". That\'s a
reference to the fact that because of the cold water, drowning victims
don\'t bloat and rise to the surface (the result of normal decay
processes). Instead, they stay on the bottom and decay via different
processes.

Gee, maybe I ought to see if our little shooting group can make a road

You should see the joke photos we made up of some of the ladies in web
gear, helmets, and a vicious grin while holding their favorite

Hmmm... come to think of it, those photos might make a nice start for
some NPC illos. :-)

Most GMs would have it blow through the armor (at this rade, it can
still do 4 points of damage to something else :-).  I suppose you
could make a passive defense roll (the same roll you would use
if the bullet was trying to pentrate from the other side)
to see if it bounced (maybe applying 1/2 damge to the victim)
but that would be a pretty hard-core GM (after all, he already
blew the bullet all the way through you, what more does he
want? :-)

Ammonia chloride is not an oxidizer.  It is a reductant (but not
much of one).  Nitrate is, in fact, a decent oxidizer (though
it is kineticially slow, which is why it doesn\'t react with
sugar until it gets a kick).

The premise is that if the shot hits, it may skip off of
the armor, particularly if it is smooth and rounded or
sloped.  If it doesn\'t skip off, it need to punch through.
PD is the former, DR is the latter.

While the line between the two can be pretty blurry, the
effect is real.  I have played around with a system gives
an piece of equipment one or the other, but not both, but
that has been just for fantasy games.  For SF games it pefer
it as is (since giving PCs _some_ chance of defending helps
roleplaying).

I always thought PD was intended to represent two things:

1) armor qualities such as roundedness, slope, and the like -- without
having to figure in a n-degree slope bonus for every make and model of
helmet, breastplate, vase, automobile door, etc.

and

2) a way to make combat less predictable -- as in, "Somehow that
high-powered rifle bullet was stopped by that SCA-guy\'s plate armor. It
must have hit just right (from the SCA-guy\'s POV, that is)."

Of course, in the latter case, this is sort of handled by the random damage
roll (5d, 3d+1, 24d, and so on).

IMTU, opening the door is not a problem. The lanthanum grid only needs to be
"unbroken" to enter jumpspace. Once in jumpspace, the ship is contained in
the jump bubble. If something is pushed out and away from the ship, it would
float towards the edge of the bubble where it would form a bubble of its
own. The amount of hydrogen lost by the ejected object would be
insignificant if it was small, (say body parts, small trash., etc) If
someone tried to take an air/raft out for a joy ride... they would most
likely cause a misjump. 3 possibilities would exist, the air/raft gets all
it needs to complete jump safely, the ship keeps enough to jump safely, or
just enough is taken to cause both to misjump. It may be possible for the
power plant fuel to be vented into the bubble to make up for the loss.
Either way, the air/raft would suffer misjump (if it has enough of the jump
bubble, the damage might not be so bad) I would say the risk is extreme to
attempt such a maneuver... but might be better than getting eaten by the
"alien" that was on the ship. I think I might take my chances with jump
physics rather than becoming lunch. Might be interesting trying to explain
why you are at 100 diameters in an air/raft... or atleast the oxegen
deprived body might be an interesting find... might be an interesting
adventure, to be prepairing to jump when you come across a "dead" air/raft.
Finding a dead person at the controls. Last log entry was incoherent... just
ramblings of, "devil\' in \'em" If the travellers took the air/raft in and
then jumps... oh how much fun they will have when the "body" opens it\'s
eyes.... and the horror begins again.

</IMTU>

Anyone have any reasons why my IMTU example couldn\'t work? Considering that
most of what we know of jumpspace is "theory" and the ref has to decide what
the "real" theory is. I figure if it is believable... it\'s playable.

IMTU (where one of Ewan\'s characters lives, btw ;-) ), ejecting
garbage in jumpspace is not a problem. Opening a door to do it *is* a
problem, since you break the lanthanum grid and, basically, jumpspace
pushes in, with an unpredictable effect... it might swallow the
character who was trying to dump the garbage. And it will probably
affect the jump.

In principle, it could be easy to dump (jump?) garbage in jumpspace.

Just have a chamber with lanthanum grid in the inside and the
outside. Put the garbage there, open it, and let jumpspace swallow
the garbage. However, it might affect the jump in an unpredictable
way... maybe you end up 1 million km away from your destination,
maybe it takes a day more.

I checked it out from G:T and G:Ultra-tech 2 and it is that way. On the
G:UT2 page 53 is the high-density dart that is effectively both AP and
impaling so the damage penetrating the armor is not halved.

I think it is mainly to allow someone with a heavy armor (lowering move and
therefore dodge) some real chance of dodging an attack.

As a side note I have used the MT UWP\'s with GURPS for a long time before

The PD could be a negative DM to the attack roll, similiar to hand-to-hand

Is the G:T weapon damage high, simply as a measure of it\'s penetrating
power? That the blow through rule simply limits the amount of damage a
bullet can do? I wanted to re-look at the messages... but the digest archive
seems to be offline. Was it limited by HT? If someone has HT 7, then only 7
points of damage are caused and the rest goes out the back side? It still
drops the guy... just doesn\'t take him to -HT?

How can this be converted to MT? Would the blow through rule effect 1 of the
stats? Still drops the guy... but isnt dead, just 1 characteristic at 0. Can
the damage values in the G:T book be kept the same? or are they too high or
too low for MT? This blow-through rule only applies to projectiles, right? A
FGMP is still going to vaperize the guy... right? (as it should)

I really should go get the Gurps Basic... I could probably answer many of
the questions myself.

With G:Vehicles 2nd ed. the PD is quite an important part of the combat
system as the effects of armor sloping on projectile glancing are better
represented by the increased PD (and therefore also dodge) than by the DR
increase.

In my games (which uses the jump fuel for energy to set up the

has wanted to risk death enough to try it intentionally and nobody
has done it accidentally and come back to tell about it....

    'body' => 'Hi all.

	Just GMed a FUDGE Traveller session on the weekend and it went
great!  I heartily recommend the system for those who prefer a little
more improv and a little less wargame in their RPG.  It\'s especially good
if you\'ve got a) Newbie players, b) Jaded oldtimers, c) Both of the above
(my situation is c). 

	The great thing about the system is that it\'s really fast and
smooth.  The other thing is that I\'ve come to realize that this sort of
improvisational system actually results in more realism because you\'re
never hemmed in by rules that don\'t fit a given situation (yes, you\'re
always free to ignore rules, but formalized systems inately discourage
this, I think).  Of course, this only works where the GM knows more about
a given topic than his players and/or his knowledgeable players are
willing to keep their mouths shut and suspend their disbelief.

	For those already using/interested in FUDGE, I\'ve included the
handout I gave to my players below.  You might be especially interested in
the combat system, which is my own special creation... 

(Eris, since you\'re the resident FUDGE expert (?) maybe you can tell me:
Do I have to put the legal stuff from FUDGE on this?  I\'ve done so here
just to be safe, but maybe I\'m being neurotic?)


ONE PAGE FUDGE

Everything in FUDGE is rated on a scale using seven words:

Superb    Great     Good      Fair      Mediocre     Poor      Pathetic


TASKS

When a character tries to do something, you take one of his attributes as
the base rating for the task.  For instance, a character might have "Good
intelligence", so this would be his/her basic level for figuring out
puzzles, fixing things and so on (unless they have a more specific skill
such as Puzzle Solving or Fixing Stuff).  

To figure out exactly how well a character does at a given task, roll four
"FUDGE dice".  These are ordinary six-sided dice painted red on two sides,
green on two sides and white on two sides.  Every green side that comes up
raises the character up a rating.  Every red side that comes up knocks
him/her down a rating. White sides have no effect and are "neutral". So a
character with "Good intelligence" rolling two green and two whites would
have a result of Superb for that task (up two from Good).  If the same
character rolled two whites, a green and a red, the latter two would
cancel out and he would end up with his default Good result. 


CHARACTER CREATION

This is very free-form and simple.  First, write up a short paragraph
describing the character in plain english.  Then just write down words
representing skills, attributes, abilities, etc. and give each a rating
word.  Good things to include are some measure of strength, toughness,
dexterity, and intelligence.  Other than that, just pick \'em as you see
\'em.  

Example Character:

Bob "Grease Monkey" Jovovich

Bob is a consumate techie.  He works as an engineer on a starship and
always seems to have his head in some machine.  If not, then he\'s reading
"Engineer\'s Monthly" or going over the specs for something.  Typically he
dresses in coveralls and an "INS Devereaux" cap.  The latter is a souvenir
from his days in the Imperial Naval Service where he learned his trade.
[This description part can be as long or as short as you like, I\'m keeping
this one short but I could go on to describe appearance, personality,
political beliefs, philosophy of life or whatever else.]

Attributes:

Strength:  Good  (He is a burly guy, but not really big)
Health:    Fair  (Bob is of average physical fitness)
Dexterity: Good  (Works a lot with his hands)
Intellect: Great (A very smart guy, sub-genius, knows alot about stuff)


Skills:

Repair:     Superb  (Bob can fix ANYTHING, he\'s a mechanical genius)
Engineer:   Great   (He really knows the ins and outs of starships)
Space Suit: Good    (Bob has spent a lot of time in low gravity/space)
Rifle:      Fair    (In the Navy, Bob was taught to fight)
Pistol:     Fair
Brawling:   Fair
Botany:     Mediocre (He has a hobby of raising exotic plants)
[This is a short list, yours can be much longer]


Special Stuff:

Drinking:   Pathetic  (Bob has a thimble gut and gets drunk on one beer)
Coolness:   Good (Bob is pretty unflappable)


Note that there\'s nothing keeping you from just writing Superb beside
everything and creating a god-like character, but that\'s not the point
(and the GM won\'t let you do it anyway, which is really the only check on
powergaming in any RPG, so...). 


COMBAT

Here\'s my system for fudge combat.  All characters must have defined
weapon skills and some sort of "Damage Capacity" attribute, which I call
Health below.  Weapons have a damage rating, and maybe some accuracy
bonuses or penalties (e.g., shotgun +1, autoweapons+2).  Armor has a
rating as well, which is modified by weapon type as necessary. 

1. Initiative:  Roll with your dex/combat reflexes/whatever.  Highest roll
goes first.

2. To Hit (Ranged): GM assigns a minimum roll to hit based on range,
target size, target movement, etc.  Roll with weapon skill to exceed this
minimum.

3. To Hit (Melee): Attacker and defender both roll.  If attacker rolls
higher than defender, he hits.

4. Damage:  Roll weapon\'s damage rating.  Roll target\'s armor rating
(=Pathetic if no armor).  The number of levels by which the damage roll
beats the armor roll is the number of points of damage done.  The victim\'s
Health is reduced by this number.

5. (Optional) Damage Effects:  Roll with present Health rating:
>Mediocre: No effects.
Mediocre: Stunned. -1 to all actions next round.
Poor: Stunned+Roll again for Poor+ to avoid falling (lose a turn).
Pathetic: Fall down (lose a turn)+Roll again for Pathetic+ to avoid KO.
<Pathetic: Knocked out+Roll again for Pathetic+ to avoid death.

There\'s a lot of rolls, but since there\'s very little figuring to do, it
works out okay.  You can skip step 5 and just say that when health goes
below Pathetic, you\'re unconscious and "eventually dead" without medical
aid.


Okay, that\'s all there is to it.  Any comments or thoughts?

Charles.

I look at the function the ship was designed to perform in one rules
set, and design a ship with a similar function in the other.  The things
I keep constant are size, TL, configuration (that\'s why I have all those
Wedge configuration T4 ships), jump capacity, and (approximately)
normal-space acceleration.  Everything else is negotiable.

I\'ve bought into the handwave - it fits my jump model better than anything

As I said, \'minor\' is a relative term.  Slowly, but surely, I am becoming
convinced that (IMTU anyway) a default Jump takes you to the stellar limit,
not the planetary one.  So a minor course deviation is measured against the
stellar system, not the planetary one.

As an aside, before I rolled the campaign back to M:0, I had a group of PCs
running around in a lab ship.  The PC who got administrative control of the
ship (i.e. rolled it as a mustering out benny) had to share it with two
other professors, one of which was a Jump Space Theorist.  He had this great
Vacc Suit that he had his grad students construct.  It would *supposedly*
tie into the ship\'s NavComp and patch into the Lanthanum grid.  It was
supposed to allow a person to be able to spacewalk in J-space...and he was
convinced that the failures of the previous suits were due to J-spaces
unique interference with robotic systems.

As far as I know, he is still trying to get some poor grad student into that
suit...

It was a lot of fun presenting the PC captain with the experiment plans for
the next jump and watch him try and figure out what it would do to the ship,
and it made the period spent in Jump at least as adventurous as the period
on the planet!

Sorry I missed the earlier part of this thread, but just wanted to pipe
in
here with my view that the G ratings of most Traveller ships are waaay
to low.  IMTU, if you\'re ship can\'t withstand 10Gs for 10 minutes,
it doesn\'t get certified.

Did you read Reality Dysfunction books?  Antimatter powered missiles
pulling 30Gs continuously.  They were small, with explosive warheads
and called Wasps.  You would launch a swarm of them to attack.
The defender would launch his own to attack the incoming ones.
They were highly illegal, and even the military didn\'t use them.

Because Antimatter powered them, it was a controlled substance.
Mere possession was a crime.

I\'d go with "Quigley Down Under"... :-)

It also helps to realize that weapons such as the Brown Bess and the
Kentucky long rifle were considerably "over powered" by modern
standards. They shot *high* mass, medium velocity rounds. They\'d
actually be *more* likely to pentrate than more recent military rounds.


Anybody have to data handy to compare muzzle energy of the Brown Bess
and modern weapons?

IMTU, there are regular reminders of Lucan\'s Black War and Black Ops, even if
just in the form of Virus.  :-)  Also the other conventional things (ships of
the black war, biowarfare weapons, etc).  

One of the Special/Black Ops forces from the pre-Rebellion 3I IMTU, is a
special breed of commando.  The rumors go as follows:  Enhanced by geneering
and cybernetics, as well as access to TL-16 hardware and to geneered and
trained for psionics, these were very well trained and very deadly,
accountable directly to the Iridium Throne, though their own chain of command.
Access, through channels that could sometimes be circumvented in extreme
measures, was also possible to assets and of the IN, IMC, and IISS as well as
the various intelligence apparatuses of the 3I.  There were 8 seperate
"forces," the definition, scope and size of which was very carefully held
secret.  Designations of these forces (or the parent organizations) were
letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha Force, Beta Force, Gamma Force, etc etc
to Theta Force).  

Particular exploits of any single force have likewise been unrevealed, though
an RCES-discovered secret INI memorandum theorized each force was a platoon
sized unit and that 6 of the 8 Forces deployed in coordinated actions in the
Fifth Frontier War.  Also hypothesized was an ordinary dispersion of 1 Force
per Domain with the 1 serving either as personal protection for the Emperor
and his family or as a reaction force to be deployed to a trouble area or for
special missions desired by the Emperor (though of course, any of them could
be pulled from their Domain).

Activites during the Rebellion are unknown except for a confused mention of
\'Eta Forces\' by a Vermene intelligence cache discovered by the RCN in late
1202 and also by revelations by Ililek Kuligaan that the IHD had cracked the
communications cipher of a unit calling itself "ISF [Imperial Special Forces]
Theta," but had failed to identify or discover anything more substantial.

More detail, I\'ll tell anyone interested, privately, as I believe one or more
of the players in my upcoming campaigns may be lurking.  None of the above is
anything beyond the detailed information available at the local office of the
Reformation Coalition Intelligence Service.

I think it\'d be more appropriate to have an intelligence unknowingly dispersed
in (or just making use of) IISS assets, as it doesn\'t compromise the IISS, nor
it\'s mission, itself.

Very Interesting.  I\'m gonna have to get Star Cruiser one of these days... 

Is there a calculation where I can plug in a lasers stats and the targets
acceleration and find out the range at which automatic hits are guaranteed?
Probable?  This could also show exactly how close a missile can get...  Also
ship to ship ramming.  PD should be able to scrub a missile, but a kamikaze is
another ball of wax... ;-)

I believe S-3, the IISS Special Security Service might have some duties
along this line. Technically they perform Scout extractions from hazardous
worlds and recapture prohibited technologies on low tech worlds.  I would
assume that this would include prior First and Second Imperium worlds not
yet re-absorbed into the Third Imperium in most Milieus.

I expect that INI, Imperial Naval Intelligence also has field agents in
neighboring confeds.  They would probably concentrate on military
intelligence.

The Sylean Rangers (at least IMTU) perform a role more like the Navy Seals
and Delta Force. For example: A RECON squad might go in to get Humit (Human
Intelligence) Assets out or take a weather control station.  An ASSAULT
squad might be inserted to respond to a terrorist group that was holding an
Imperial noble hostage.

This has been suggested as a house rule.  I don\'t use it
myself....

>power?

High damage means "high damage".  Power to damage is, to a first
aproximation, also power to punch through armor. Weapons that are
designed to be expecially pentrating (with respect to other weapons
that do similar damage) get a modifier to DR.

>That the blow through rule simply limits the amount of damage a
>bullet can do?

Yes.  The bullet literally "blows through you" and out the otherside.
The amount a damage you take by getting a reasonable sized hole
punched through does really depend on how much energy the bullet
had left when it was done....

>Was it limited by HT? If someone has HT 7, then only 7
>points of damage are caused and the rest goes out the back side? It still
>drops the guy... just doesn\'t take him to -HT?

Right.  Unless it hits the vitals (in which case it is limited
by 3xHT) or the Brain (I don\'t remember if it is 4xHT or if
there is no blowthrough limimt for the brain).  In which a shot
might take him to -2xHT or -3xHT.

>How can this be converted to MT? Would the blow through rule effect 1 of the
>stats? Still drops the guy... but isnt dead, just 1 characteristic at 0

Don\'t know.  The premise of the limit is that if you stick a hole
through a guy and not hit a vital organ, he isn\'t likely to drop
dead one the spot.  He is likely to loose consciousness and may
bleed to death.  If you hit him in a vital organ, he may well
be likely to die.

>This blow-through rule only applies to projectiles, right? A
>FGMP is still going to vaperize the guy... right? (as it should)

No.  It applies to any weapon that will punch through you like
that (a spear thrust has blow through, an axe doesn\'t). However,
I don\'t know if one expects a FGMP to punch a hole through
you or to blow the front off of you (maybe do both?  :-).  I
don\'t have my book in front of me....

I think the poster was refering to idea that, since vehicles tend
to have big weapons, they tend to ignore PD under the PD reduction
rule.  It might be said that PD isn\'t important for moderate to
large sized vehicles....

An FGMP does Exp damage, which does not blow through.  As such, the minimum
damage for an FGMP (160 damage) instakills any human.

However, a laser (doing Imp damage) can blow through, though I think they blow
through at 2xHT instead of 1xHT.

Actually, if you use T4 combat rules, every hit has some small chance for a
"ship explodes" result.   So enough fighters blasting away at a captial ship
might indeed blow it up.   Multiple small hits will also wear down armor
eventually and scrub off turret weapons and other devices.   So in T4 at least
fighters are not completely insignificant.   No, they won\'t routinely sink
capital ships in one hit--but hell why would anyone build a captial ship if
that were the case (as no one does today).

This is also very consistent with RL.  One of the early discoveries in tank
designs was that sloped armor is _much_ more effective then unsloped.  An
example using GURPS:

A veteran tank driver, with a skill of 16 has a basic dodge of 4.  This
means he needs to roll 4 or less on 3d6 to avoid a blow, thus, a tank will
suffer damage from a successful hit 98.2% of the time.  Adding sloped armor
to this, raises the dodge to 10, thus dropping the probability of damage to
only 50%.  
	
This is an _integral_ part of the GURPS combat system, and I strongly
suggest that it be used if you plan on using the rest of the GURPS system.
If you choose not to use it, you may want to significantly raise the DR of
all available armors, otherwise, the weapon-armor balance will suffer greatly.

	I generally am inclined to let them have the weapons.  I won\'t let them
use/carry them without getting in lots of trouble.  I think they make a
wonderful temptation and overall great plot hook as they try to hang onto
this white elephant they can\'t carry anywhere.  My theory on weapons
acquired while mustering out is they are responsible for them.  Don\'t get
them stolen.  Don\'t do anything stupid with them. OR ELSE! <g>

I\'m at a loss to understand that statement, since one of the problems with
jump drive fuel consumption is that ALL the jump fuel is used up BEFORE the
ship enters jump space.

[My own explanation is that jump space is denser than (outer) real space,
and that it is therefore impossible to cross the dimensional interface
without \'softening it up\' first (Compare it to the effect of a high-speed
vehicle trying to dive into water; at sufficiently high velocities the
water is as rigid as steel). All the H2 is used to create a small spot in
jumpspace where a ship can slip into the dimension. Once inside jump space
there\'s no problem (the water analogy applies here too) and no more
hydrogen is necessesary. The reason why you need more H2 to enter higher
jumpspace dimensions is that they are denser and need more hydrogen to
create a \'soft spot\'. This also explain why you can\'t jump without H2 even
if your capacitors are fully charged.]

Actually, I believe that the official ruling on the matter is that
blowthrough is always the last thing you look at, after all other damage
modifiers (including DR, the doubling for an impaling weapon, or the
halving for an AP weapon)

There is _no_ blowthrough for the damage to the brain (see the GURPS FAQ at
http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/faq/#BS-04)
Thus, average damage is 84, resulting in instant death.

Basic assumption 1: you can squeeze 2.5 people per ton into 1000+ dton ships.
Basic assumption 2: a ship can make 10 round trips per year.
Goal: move at least 60 million people in 11 years.

Ships    People moved   6 million people =
         per year       how many ships?
1000t     25,000        240
2000t     50,000        120
3000t     75,000         80
4000t    100,000         60
5000t    125,000         48

7000t    175,000         34

10000t   250,000         24
20000t   500,000         12

So I think your solution may be in 3000t and 4000t
ships, which give you the most bang for your buck.

40 or 50 of these two types, making more or less
regular runs for 10 years, will get you over 60
million people on Prometheus.

But if you use T4 rules, then 8,000 of those or so will end up dead.  That\'s
pretty steep.  Perhaps you can jam people into a ship in an uncomfortable
fashion and avoid cold sleep, as CoDominium  Bureau of Relocation does in
Jerry Pournelle\'s Falkenberg\'s Legion series.   The description of
"involuntary colonist" transport is unpleasant, but sounds better than a 1 in
12 chance of death.

deal, when ships are flying about with laser cannon.   When mercaries and

Scraggly red hair, freckled, youthful-looking.  Irish brogue.
Played by: Any Irish stereotype
Likes home-brewed alcohol. Has a good ear for finding cargo shipments. Knows how to
pilot a ship\'s boat. Owns a ramshackle dive on the outskirts of startown.  He
doesn\'t want it anymore because protection fees are skyrocketing, but he also can\'t
dig himself out of debt.  Most likely he will just disappear on the next ship bound
to leave the system.


Lucas Reynard, age 33
Straight red hair, serious expression.
Played by: Gerard of Amber
Knows a lot of local lore. He was training to be a prospector. He has Cr500,000 in
the bank. This money is ill-gotten, from a scam pulled long ago.  He has laid low
for the past 5 years, waiting patiently for another prime chance to get more money
from unsuspecting freighters.



Sir Kashiin Renner, age 38
Short flax hair; cocky grin.
Played by: ST:Voyager\'s pilot, or Renner from _Mote_
A cocky ex-Navy boy, Renner is a great pilot and knows it.  He also thinks he\'s a
pretty good captain as well, and often gets in trouble for over-analyzing
strategic situations.  On the other hand, he is a bright person.  He barely got out
of the Navy intact; his casual manner guaranteed that he never rose in the ranks.


Burke Scrimshaw, age 32
Bald.  Intense.
Played by: James Burke
A philosopher-pilot, Burke concentrates on the human condition almost as much as
piloting.  He is a competent pilot, and doesn\'t let his habit of staring into the
heavens get in the way of his work.  Much.  In his spare time, Burke prefers to
play poker, sip exotic alcohols, and bounce philosophic concepts off the crew.  He
does this mainly for amusement, for he seldom finds "a worthy adversary".


Alesendria Dracar, age 38
Long, red hair.  Short temper.
Played by: Gates McFadden
A pilot by trade, Alesandria dabbles in the arts and sciences.  Her background
includes research and (a little) teaching at a college, spending time as an intern
at a major hospital, and some business experience.  She paints for recreation.  She
also likes to visit the firing range (she needs the practice).

Based on the emails I received, I\'d like to clear up some misconceptions:

1) I\'m in no danger of cracking up.  I\'m not the one in trouble, and my
kid will pull through in the end.  I\'m certainly not worried about finding
a suicide note this time.  (Been there, done that, and don\'t want to do it
again. Ever.) If you really want to help, do some volunteer work in your
local community (many of you do this already).  

2) I didn\'t, and don\'t, think that any member of the TML practices violent
crime (including non-consensual sex) or sex with minors.  I teach
children, 12-19, and unfortunately some of the remarks simply hit too
close to a current situation I\'m dealing with*.  My request to drop the
topic was in the same vein as someone who recently lost a friend wanting
to avoid the topic of death for a while. 

3) While I\'m not reading the TML right now, I (obviously) haven\'t
unsubscribed, and I haven\'t deleted any digests. I probably won\'t have
time to read the digests, but if you desperately want a comment email me
with the digest number and I\'ll have a look. (Or send me the original
message, whichever is easier.)  However, I think it best for everyone if I
stay away for a week or so -- I\'m short of sleep and that always makes me
say things I regret later.

4) I\'m not dropping Traveller, just not interacting with the TML for a
while. I\'ve emailed Jeff Zeitlin the RTF version of 101 Starships revision
2, and BITS and SJG will get the PDF versions tomorrow.  GT Shipyard is
out, Imperial Grand Survey is out, and Metator is well underway.  

5) Aldous Huxley summarized all the advice he gave in his life as: "Try to
be a little kinder."  If we all (including most emphatically myself)
follow this, we\'ll get along fine.


*Obviously I can\'t give you details about any specific case. Divorce,
suicide, murder, rape, incest, forced prostitution... it\'s been an
eventful career so far, with nearly thirty years to go. I\'d gross over a
million dollars more if I stayed an engineer, but quite frankly I love my
kids too much to leave them behind and go back to code and circuits.

Personally, I don\'t use the G:Martial Arts rules, but the others are
appropriate.

The second tier of books (read as: not necessary, but will really, really
help.) are: 

Compendium I (But the GM should carefully limit which ads/disads are
available)
Ultratech
Ultratech 2
Hightech (If you have a lot of GTL7- stuff in your campaign)

The third tier is 
Mecha (for battledress)
Fantasy Folk (For minor race creation)
Vehicles 2nd
Biotech

Sounds like the plasma(?) weapon from the classic Star Trek episode
"Balance of Terror"  (The one where the Romulans shoot an expanding ball of
plasma at the enterprise.)

I think a weapon like this also exists in the Babylon Wars war game.

  The one ship bit bothers me, too, although HG does make you pay a stiff 
price for putting your reserve behind an inadequate screem - IIRC, it\'s a
free round of unanswered fire on the reserve/screened elements if no firing
vessels remain in your line at the end of a round.

  If you do play it out on hexes (and assume that you can\'t enter a hex
occupied by a firing enemy unit - see alternative below) then the number
of "line" sites that need to be occupied increases as detachments try to
go around the otherwise near-point (single hex) battleline to get at your
reserves. The discussion on SF-CONSIM pretty much concluded that you could
force at least a comprehensive 2-D situation using vector movement, but a
given game design may not wish to complicate matters with a map.

  Agreed, and the 2300 rule pretty much fixes it if applied - at close enough
range shots are simply exchanged (at short range or short w/bonus hit mods)
tit for tat until one unit is unable to continue firing - at which point it
will likely be completely scrubbed away; ROF 400+ at a few thousands of km\'s
is nothing less than appalling, even in theory.

  There might actually be a special niche for (non-HG design sequence) gunships
with either battery powered (rules-dependent) or det-laser missile armaments
that serve primarily as speed bumps to deter enemy escorts from closing rapidly;
impaling oneself on units optimized for short term firepower is not a good idea.

  Does not follow if the intervenor is between the two elements. The limited
case you describe would, however, apply to a force in a hex trying to stop
attackers in multiple divergent locations, which is where hex maps or highly
sophisticated abstract displays become essential - of course, some of those
might be more awkward than a hex display itself...

That\'s a tough one, as you\'re trying to hit a moving target in some ways.
You\'ve got your GURPS psionic rules, your Ultra-Tech medical rules, your
GURPS Space spacecraft combat rules (which are modified for Traveller by the
G:T book.) which is abstract combat, the detailed combat rules in G:T which
for space combat, which uses a hex map; your vehicle combat rules (also
modified for traveller) from GURPS Vehicles.  This leaves out GURPS
Cybertech, the Ultra-Tech 2 Safe-tech rules and about a half dozen other
possibilities.

I believe that this system is used because GURPS was originally evolved from
the MAN-TO-MAN rule set which was primarily concerned with fantasy-medieval
weapon combat. The use of armor and shields is very important in that
context and SJ wanted a way to differentiate the Passive Defense that
resulted from the use of a shield or armor, which prevents a character from
taking a hit and the Damage Resistance clothing or armor gives when taking a
hit.  It\'s been a good 18 years since I first used M-T-M so I might remember
wrong.  Anybody ever have SJ tell them why he used this system?

I\'ve made this suggestion numerous times.  Use a combination of grid and coil
technology.  The coil will make a spheroid jump field with multiple coils able
to deform it somewhat.  However, it becomes very inefficient to wrap a needle
configuration in a sphere.  Thus you use the grid in order to mould your jump
field into a tighter shape around your vessel.

How does this apply to your complaints?

Well, in the case of ship damage, the field will tend to leak out through holes
in the grid which might cause a bubble in the field at the leak while reducing
the field slightly around the rest of the ship.  Until the leakage draws enough
off to bring the field into contact with the hull, you can still jump.  You then
arbitrarilly set  the damage to suit your game universe.  Likewise, if you can
produce enough extra jump capability (extra power, fuel, etc.) you might be able
to compensate for more damage.

In the case of pusher ships, you can design their grids so that they
intentionally leak out in a specific direction (towards the captured vessel) or
even do away with your ship\'s grid and rely on spheroid shaped bubbles from
coils.

IMO, you throw something out into jumpspace, you never see it again w/ no

It is?  I know that view of the fuel usage (which I\'m not sure the source of)
is what dooms drop tanks, too.  Why not just say some has to be used
throughout jump (as "displacement mass, coolant, and/or "normal" fuel)?  What
canon does that violate?  It would seem to go against the grain of the
Jumpspace article in JTAS (which implies that jump w/o Lhyd is possible), but
anything else?

[IMTU, J-fuel is, as listed in FF&S, collectively "normal" fuel, coolant, and
displacement mass, all of which is Lhyd.  The coolant and fuel \'parts\' are
both consumed at the same time and are used throughout jump (maintaining the
J-field) while the displacement mass is used to to fill the space that
"leaves" normal space w/ the ship and precedes the space the ship will fill
when it precipitates.]

G-comp is limited by technology.  I\'m pretty sure u\'re aware of that, but just
making sure it\'s noted.  I\'m sure limited periods of high accel are possible
in atmosphere by craft designed for such (pulling and/or turning hard, etc),
though I\'m not sure if such is possible in space...  maybe a "slingshot"
around a gravity well or something.  I don\'t believe in "overdrive" as the
higher accel isn\'t designed for (at least in FF&S and FFS2... not sure bout
G:V).  For long periods (20min HG and 30 min BL/BR turns) the *crew* can\'t
take the higher accel.  In workstations/accel couches, you can take off 2 more
G\'s of str8 accel and 1 more of evasion.  Pop in G-tanks and there\'s another.
Then one more and there\'s a -1 Diff Mod to all actions.  Another and Bad
Things (tm) start to happen.  So at TL-15 you\'re limited to 10G\'s max for
straight, 9 for evasion.  Now look at how much of the ship is to M-drives.
Note how much space is lost to the g-tanks.  

Or do you mean for short intensity bursts?  To what end?  Evasion?  Given
\'short intensity,\' ineffective with the long range and duration of Traveller
space combat.

And antimatter isn\'t a concern in 1100, as its\' largely beyond of the tech
capabilities of the 3I.  Now in the Regency, it\'s on the horizon (Vincennes
and Mora are TL-16 and Vincennes, at least, is TL-17 if you just add water).
That\'ll just mean the ROF 800 PD lasers make a firm appearance on military
ships.  ;-)

There\'s a huge common sense problem w/ dodge rules against direct fire and one
here, too IMO.  Basically, a hit or miss is based on the aim of the weapon.
Jinking, fast movement, range, etc etc all affect the aim (giving proper lead,
anticipating movement), but a tank driver can\'t do anything but jink
randomly... there is no active "dodge" involved, just trying to avoid patterns
in movement, etc.  Berm drills involve coming up just enough to fire and
backing down just as soon as the tank has fired.  No dodging involved.  GURPS
doesn\'t let characters dodge against small arms fire, does it?  I can see
adding a raw difficulty or target number or whatever, and also cover and
concealment, but not a skill in actively evading fire.  For vehicle and
personal combat. IMOA.  YMMVTRLDNIMO.

Was one of my biggest beefs w/ Star Wars, too.  I had players that made The
Mask and Remo Williams proud when in Real Life (tm), there\'s very little you
can do except hope the other guy isn\'t as good as shot and you can nail him
first.

Just FTR, tanks have been and are my business.  USMC MOS 1812 M1A1 tank
crewman here (gunner).  Being a gunner means I was once a driver, too.  It\'s
avoiding a pattern that\'s the tricky part...  even if you think you\'re not,
you end up falling into one (though it might be a complicated one) without
constant direction from the TC, unless u\'re very erratic (which has a bad
habit for po\'ing the gunner).

Having shot a .69 caliber Brown Bess dozens of times I would not want to
be within its threat envelope at 50 to 100 yards. Very messy to flesh,
pumpkins, and cinder blocks at that range. They\'re not very aimable but
devestating to legs, arms, heads, and torsos if these are hit with the
Bess\'s lead rock within these ranges. Bernie Cornwell ain\'t kidding when
he writes about the carnage those guns can do in his Sharpe novels.
Reading surgeons reports from the American Revolution and the Pennisular
Wars are pretty gruesome, and I know a gentleman who was \'knicked\' by a
.69 in a range accident, if you can call scars that look like a roll of
quarters was shoved through his outer right thigh. And he was hit a 80+
yards! I haven\'t fired my Dixie BB in about two years but my shoulder
still cringes at the thought.

A Kentucky/Pennsylvania Rifle of .50 or .60 caliber will put a fairly
devestating deep crater in a V-8 engine block at 200 yards. I\'ve done
it. They  kick like a Garand, hit like a .308 Winchester. Their chief
limitation is ROF. In (very) much  better hands than mine they can be
the equal of most modern bolt action rifles for aim and damage, with
delicate hand loading these people can hit a targets at 700 yards. I own
a .50 Cal. Hawken now that has an effective range of 200 yards, but
usually is more lethal from 50 to 150. It has tremendous penetration for
a round ball.

My current love is a .54 Caliber Berdan\'s Sharps, "MA BELLE"  (orignals
were .52 caliber, but the replicas are a little bigger to help
distinguish from real ones and fakes, and they shoot better). With this
double trigger long rifle with a dropping  breech (8-10 RPM) I\'m sure  a
marksman could nail a trooper in Battle Dress at 300 yards or more. An
accuritized Sharp\'s with a 4X scope is a extremely lethal sniper rifle
out to 500 yards. This was done repeatedly during the American Civil War
by members of Berdan\'s United States Sharpshooters. Other heavy,
particularly Bavarian percussion target (jaeger) rifles had longer
ranges and bigger calibers. The confederates used in small numbers the
english Whitworth, which had a hexagonal \'rilfling\' with a corresponding
\'hex\' bullet. One of these killed Maj. General John Sedgwick at
Spotsylvania from over 800 yards. His last words were "Why men, they
can\'t hit an elephant at this dis...."

Now if the entire BD is bullet resistant to an ACR (which they\'re not)
then a Brown Bess or a Berdan\'s couldn\'t really mess up a Imperial
Troopers day. But I wonder, how the Imeprial Army (or Marines) would
allow guerillas to get that close with the tech lead in sensors,
counter-fire, and intelligence. Perhaps a sharpshooter would nail one
trooper or even two, but the anti-sniper response would be devestating.
With doppler, micromillimeter radars, ladar, ballistic compututers the
size of matchbooks,etc for sensors, PGMP, FGMP, smart mortars, or just
plain tunsten rods from orbit for retaliation would make such an attack
untenable. Guerillas might not give a damn, but good shots are scarce.
However, don\'t underestimate the power of black powder rifles! Try the
North-South Skirmish Association web site for tables \'n\' such. I\'m not
kidding!

Oh, we _definately_ had combat! :-)  A bunch of Aslan Ihatei invaders blew
in through the roof of a mall on Tarsus where the characters were trying
to buy some equipment and all hell broke lose.  I basically pulled the
values out of my head, giving the Aslan heavy battledress Superb
protection against most things and slug weapons damage ratings from Good
to Superb. The characters quickly headed for the weapons shop (Tarsus Law
Level=0, BTW) and grabbed a heavy guass gun and an anti-aircraft missile
launcher.  The HDGG made quick work of a couple of baddies, but the AA
headed straight up through the hole in the roof looking for airborne
targets instead of hitting the Alsan it was aimed at. Much hilarity ensued
when a damaged Aslan G-Carrier came crashing down through the roof a
moment later... :-)

We even had space combat in fact, though here I used the "story element"

things is the limits to which one can go.  In a system like FUDGE\'s
subjective character design, the sky\'s the limit.  In a system like GURPS
the limit depends on the points allowed for chargen.  In either system a
power-gamer is going to go to the limit, and the only thing stopping him
is the GM.  It\'s like that old joke about trains: 

"They say the car on the end of a train is the most dangerous one to be in
if it crashes."

"Oh really?  Then why don\'t they take it off?" :-)
 
Trying to "balance" a game system is similarly doomed to fail, IMHO.
You just end up changing the end-points of the scale.  Not that there\'s no
benefit in giving some structure to chargen, just that it won\'t stop
minmaxers.

Luckily for me, I\'ve got a good group of players (two veterans and two
newbies), so I didn\'t have to do much of the iron fist thing. One of the
newbies may be a budding power-gamger, but in the young ones it\'s just
kinda cute, y\'know? :-)

Ciao,
Charles.

	You want dangerous in the wrong hands? Yesterday on the plane I was
reading an article in Reader\'s Digest about a kid who built a BREEDER
REACTOR in his mother\'s garden shed. Imagine coming home and seeing
yellow tape around your neighbor\'s yard, and men in full isolation
suits emptying the contents of your neighbor\'s shed into 55-gallon
drums with radiation warnings, and then dissassembling the same shed
into those drums ...

	Brief synopsis (some details mangled): kid with too much
imagination. Parents start him off on "Golden Age of Chemistry
Experiments Book." He gets banished to experimenting in garden shed
after explosion in basement. Dad, in attempt to provide good
experience, enrolls kid in Boy Scouts. First merit badge he earns:
Atomic Energy.

	Kid decides he wants to irradiate stuff. Impersonates high school
teacher, corresponds with NRC about isotopes, enrichment, etc.
Helpful bureaucrat tells him safety isn\'t a big issue, as anything
that strong is under NRC license. Kid discovers smoke detectors
contain americium. Convinces smoke detector company to sell him a
hundred broken ones, at a buck apiece (part of "science project.").
Collects americium, places in small lead block with tiny hole, which
is now emitting alpha particles. Places aluminum foil in front of
alpha stream, which absorbs alphas and emits neutrons.

	Kid decides that\'s not enough, takes to salvaging old clocks,
scraping radium off. Finds vial of radium paint in antique store,
purifies. Stronger neutron emitter.

	Somehow gets hold of piece of pitchblende (uranium ore). Afer a few
false starts, manages to produce neutrons of right energy to aim at
pitchblende.

	Discovers gas lantern mantles contain thorium. Buys a few gross
mantles, burns to ash. Throws in stack of lithium batteries, cut
open, and heats in bunsen burner to produce thorium a few thousand
times purer than nature, and a few hundred times above level
requiring NRC license. 

	Mixes thorium, pitchblende in aluminum foil, irradiates with
neutrons. At this point, walking the neighborhood with his geiger
counter, he\'s getting readings all the way down the street. Thinks
perhaps this Is Not A Good Idea. Throws stuff in trunk, drives off.

	Concerned Citizen reports possible tire theft, cops respond.
Discover briefcase in trunk, padlocked, sealed with tape. Kid warns
about contents. Cops get concerned, contact EPA, eventually full
radiation team responds.

Technology is a poor replacement for tactics.  One of the problems with
putting a high tech trooper on the ground is that if, through superior
tactics and terrain advantage, one (or hundreds) of those neanderthals does
manage to take out one of your troopers, then they would have your tech.
Don\'t risk what you aren\'t willing to lose.

Perhaps I am the one with the misunderstanding.  I believe (but I\'m not 
pulling out tomes to verify it yet) that the jump process required \'most\' 
of the fuel, with the remaining amounts originally going to cool the Zuccai 
crystals.  Then, when the theory of the N-space bubble was put forth, it 
was theorized (fantasized??) that the pure H2 was needed so that the 
deterioration of the N-space bubble would be controlled and easier to 
forecast (and explain why unpurified H2 causes misjumps, when it doesn\'t 
affect N-space power generation).

Thus (my numbers) 90% of the required fuel is put into energy productions, 
with the remaining 10% needed to ensure the N-space bubble\'s integrity 
through the duration of the Jump.  This is how it is explained IMTU, at any 
rate.

I\'ve always had a problem with the Lanthium Grid concept that M.M.

a number of years after the initial creation of Traveller.  The ability to
PREVENT a ship from jumping by creating a break in the grid should effect
combat damaged ships in ways that I\'ve not seen in the rules.  It also 
gives
ships that are being hijacked an option that I don\'t want... I DO want

Yes but presumably the Moot does not make their decisions in a vacuum.
They need sources of information to make these sorts of decisions.  Is
it not possible that IRIS is one of them?

Yes it is however that can just as easily be interpreted as meaning: we
(GDW) are not yet ready to commit to the details of all of the Imperiums
spy agencies, therefore we are labeling this one a variant so the refs
can decide.  It could even be interpreted as: The
particular details about the IRIS organization are a variant.

If they had meant: In the official Traveller universe the organization
IRIAS does not exist and we are publishing this article only for those
of you who want to throw in a non canonical spook agency they might have
conveyed that message a bit more bluntly.

What Strephon says [Survival Margin pg. 28] is

"Who are these IRIS people?
You\'d think that I might have heard of them once or twice."

Notice that Strephon does not say  "What is his IRIS organization that I
have never heard of?  What Strephon said could just as easily be read as
saying  "Who are _these_ IRIS people? I.E. We do not recognize the names
and faces of these particular agents from the real agency IRIS.  Perhaps
they are/were somewhat more junior in the agency then they portray
themselves as being and that is why We have not heard of them." 
Therefore IRIS can exist in your Traveller universe.  Strephon has not
denied that IRIS exists he has only disputed the claim to importance of
_these_particular_ IRIS agents.

This interpretation of the text is, admittedly, less obvious.  However
as Emperor Strephon is in politics & therefore we must assume that if
anything he says is true it is true only in the most literal & weaseling
senses of the word.  Naturally we need to take a good hard look at
anything he says rather than interpret it in only one way.

First, reference to canon:  Book 6: Scouts provides in the character
generation section (pp. 14-15, 19) that Scouts may obtain gun combat
skill in a Basic Traveller weapons, but not combat rifle (the Book 4:
Mercenary skill that governs assault rifle, ACR, gauss rifle).  So that
indicates that Scout ships would have, at most, laser rifles and auto
rifles in the ship\'s locker.  

Nevertheless, I don\'t find ACRs to be excessively heavy fire power for
any Scout ship\'s locker.  The Scouts have to deal with a lot of
different situations a long way from any help, and armed only with only
their wits and what they have aboard ship.  In my Traveller campaigns,
while the IISS did set regulations about what weapons Scout ships were
authorized and required to carry, Scout ships in actual service usually
had a variety of weapons aboard, both official issue and, um, scrounged
... sometimes from the other services, sometimes from other branches of
the IISS.

The Imperial Rules of War only apply to war between member states of the
Imperium.  The 
Imperium doesn\'t allow commerce raiding as part of such warfare, because
it impinges on the Imperial Navy\'s total domination of space.  The
Imperium views any such commerce raiding as simple piracy, and deals
with it as such.  What about attacking a freighter in port?  Starports
are considered part of the Imperium, not the member state, so such an
attack is an attack on the Imperium -- bad idea.  What about attacking a
freighter on its way to downport while it\'s in the atmosphere, and thus
safely out of Imperial jurisdiction?  I don\'t know, but that\'s probably
your best shot, and you won\'t have time to give to the crew.  

What do others think about commerce raiding customs between independent
states, like the Imperium, the Zhodani Consulate, various Vargr states,
the 2000 Worlds, the Hive, the Solomani Confederation, the Aslan
Hierate, the Sword Worlds, the Darrians, and the Federation of Arden?  I
think rules vary, and individual commanders have a lot of latitude. 
There probably isn\'t anything like a Geneva convention governing
treatment of civilians and prisoners of war to which all of the major
independent powers have agreed. I suspect that the K\'Kree just kill any
non-vegetarian, non-enslavable sophonts that get in their way, whether
civilian or military.  The three major human states and the Aslan (and
the Sword Worlds) have some traditions of honorable conduct that would
likely lead to informal agreements about how to handle prisoners and the
like.

When the "New World" was being colonized by the European powers many
colonies were planted along the shores.  Sometimes the colonies
fought, sometimes they traded.  In many cases if the colonies were
left to their own devices they would work together.  It was the
"mother countries" that didn\'t want that to happen.

In unsettled areas, with several colonizing powers, I can see
situations were several will plant colonies on the same world.  As
you wrote above, interesting situations may arise.

Depends on your universe, I suppose.  GTL-8 light concealable armor
is about the *best* a civilian would have access to in mine, so DR10
is pretty good IMTU.  Most don\'t wear armor at all, and getting into
a fight with guns is something to avoid not seek out.

Which rules?  (I should point out that although I am a lawyer, I\'m not a
rules lawyer when I play or run RPGs; this question may nevertheless
clarify the problem.)  According to Book 4: Mercenary, mustering out is
as per Traveller Book 1:  Characters and Combat, which does not provide
for FGMPs as mustering out weapons (just basic Traveller weapons).  I
don\'t remember what Megatraveller or T4 provided, and I don\'t have TNE
nor G:T.  I note that your statement says, "The book says, IIRC ...."  A
closer look at the book may help.

As an old referee, I would handle the situation in one of these ways: 
(1) The PC can choose a Basic Traveller gun (and subsequent benefits of
"gun" can be taken as skill in that weapon -- even if that skill was not
available through the character generation process).  Remember, just
because you\'re on a TL 15 planet doesn\'t mean that the only weapons are
FGMPs.  There will be presently manufactured weapons of lower tech
level.  For example, a TL 15 auto pistol will be made of alloys that
don\'t self-weld in vaccuum, will have an integral laser target
designator (probably x-ray laser, visible only with appropriate
goggles), will be 25% lighter, will have a safety mechanism linkable to
a specific shooter (or group), etc.  In addition, there will be many old
and off-world weapons of lower tech level, including war souvenirs.  I
usually think of the "gun" and "blade" mustering out benefits as
representing souvenirs.  

(2)  The PC can have that FGMP that he wants so badly, but it\'s a
souvenir from one of those counter-insurgency missions -- it\'s missing a
lot of parts and can\'t be fired at all, let alone safely.  Still, with a
lot of TLC (in the form of mech-3, elec-3, high energy weapons-3, and
lots of Cr) it can be made a very functional part of one\'s personal
arsenal.  And it will look really cool with that Sword Worlds logo ...
wait the Sword Worlds don\'t have TL 15 weapons ... the SW logo is
painted over something ... the Imperial Sunburst! ... "property of
Imperial Marines; unauthorized possession is an Imperial High Crime" ...

Anyway, even mustering out benefits can lead to role-playing
opportunities.

Well, the Imperium is so overwhelmingly stronger than any red-zoned
potential member state that it just lets the nationalists freak out
until they\'re all dead or bankrupt or both.  The Imperium has the
resources and the time to wait until the potential member really wants
to join -- even if it takes forever.

I\'m not talking about G comp.  I\'m talking about the ability of a ship and

If you\'ve got manuevering capability, it should be.

Some real world G data (without G-comp, AG, inertia compensators):

You can go out right now to one of those \'fighter combat\' deals where
you chase a friend around in a two-seater prop plane and pull 6Gs
for half a minute or so.  The instructors won\'t let you do much more
than that for safety reasons.

You can\'t be a US military fighter pilot unless you can maintain
control of a fighter at 9Gs for 30 seconds (and control means
active manuevering, firing, hitting buttons and switches, etc, not
just maintaining consciousness).  Some of the new equipment
still in the development though being actively tested has demonstrated
that military pilots can withstand 12Gs for 45 seconds and still
fly their plain as needed.

I forgot what the Space Shuttle does but, IIRC, its starts at 7Gs
and then gradually decelerates but is in orbit in 12 minutes.

IMHO, the way they\'re designed, the average Free Trader with 1G
acceleration, and presumably tolerance somewhere slightly above that,
is a daintly little balloon that I wouldn\'t land on a world with an atmosphere.
Even some of the more powerful ships, and I use that term loosely, are
nothing but a target in a hostile environment.  Putting them in an atmosphere
with the slightest potential for trouble is a big risk.

Heck, most modern military fighters would circles around a Rampart fighter.
Only 6Gs, in a vacuum?  Thats a target, not a fighter.

> Or do you mean for short intensity bursts?  To what end?  Evasion?  Given

> space combat.

How about attack?  If I can pull 12Gs in my TL9 F22, and you can only
pull 6Gs in your Rampart, I get to put my hullmounted weapons on you,
and you haven\'t got a prayer of putting your hull-mounted weapons on me.

Give me some Hi-G missiles.  Heck, 50 calibers, with some 30mm cannon.
Good bye Rampart.

Ok, doubt many of us do such intensive combat gaming.  But here is how
I look at it.  Ships are more valuable than their personnel.  For the manufacturer

owner, thats true.  MegaCredits are MegaCredits.  So, when it hits the fan,
I want my ship to be able to withstand more Gs than the people inside.
I can always clean the ship.

All this fuss over a couple of ACRs and an FGMP-15.

May I remind people that you can put several hundred megajoules
of long range fun into a single turret on the scoutship.

The problem with having an FGMP-15 but no battledress and supporting
squad of Imperial Marines is the large "shoot me now!" sign.

That and if the PCs can muster out with one, any mercenary group
they meet has a chance of having one.

I agree that Rob will be missed, I didn\'t always agree with him, but he was an
OK guy, and contributed some useful stuff. But, I disagree we should blame
Cliff for Rob\'s leaving

While one can disagree with people\'s honest reactions to ridiculous requests,
they are still their honest reactions, and Cliff is still completely correct
when he said that we should not go round  walking on eggshells in every
subject just in case someone happens to have a hang-up over a subject. That
would effectively stifle _all_ conversation.

This is a public forum (yes I know it\'s a mailing list not a news group, but
it\'s _still_ a public forum as anyone can join, even Cliff again if he really
wanted to) and it is up to each individual to judge her ability to appear in a
public forum without risking damge to her psyche.

Rob has now made the decsion that he can\'t handle that, and it is his
decision. It may have come a little late,  in a perfect world he probably
should have left before this incident, but one cannot always adequately judge
one\'s own mental state.

I think the loss of both of them is equally bad, Rob for his existing body of
work, Cliff for the fact that he said what he thought, regardless of the
harpies amongst you,and had some good ideas.

And I feel like Escalus, Prince of Verona :

See what a scourge is laid upon you hate ,
that heaven finds a means to kill your joys with love.
And I, for winking at your discords, too
have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.

Well, I did some design work. Using bunks you can cram 1,000 colonists
plus 500Td of cargo (at 1.5 metric tonnes per m^3) into a 4,000Td hull at
TL 9 at a cost of MCr 1,800. When I did the figures for the initial Terran
colonisation prior to the 1st IW I assumed 10 years of colonisation and only
10 million people not born on Terra. So that gave 10 million people moved
per year. Assuming 10 round trips per year, that means you need 1,000
such ships (requiring an investment of MCr 1,800,000). A significant effort,
but within the realms of possibility.

IMTU, anything leaving the jump field reappears as if it had misjumped
from the starting point.
(ie random direction, random distance, random time of multiple weeks.)

Roll separately for each atom. :-)

However, being close to the edge of jumpspace can cause jump sickness
and poking a stick into jumpspace conducts that effect to the wielder.

I like to use the expanding jump field wave to cause jump sickness.  It
expands out from the coil pretty quickly so you normally only get a brief
disorientation, but if you actually stick your head into the actual field
front for any length of time you\'d likely get very scrambled physiologically
speaking.

Thanks, Rob.  I hope this helps your M:E21 campaign as well. :)
Based on the figures presented so far, I\'m looking at the average
Colony ship built along the following lines:

TL 9, 4000t, J1 (with fuel enough for two jumps), M1g, limited or no 
firepower (using escorts), storing 100,000 colonists in Cold Sleep

Additionally, smaller organizations, nations, and corporate concerns 
utilize a smaller colony ship, built along the following lines:

TL 9, 1000t, J1 (with fuel enough for two jumps), M1g, limited 
firepower, storing 25,000 colonists in Cold Sleep

I\'ll work on the two vessels tonight, under MT rules.  If all goes 
well, I\'ll post them within 24 hours.  Any other suggestions or 
thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Wait, this just in:  Andrew M-V posted his thoughts on the subject
in the most recent digest (#341), including a vessel design.  Hmmm. 
 I like the concept of not transporting the colonists in Cold Sleep,
which eliminates the problem of a consistent loss of people through
tech failures, etc.  I\'d probably consider packing them into much
closer quarters, seeing how people travelled to the US during the
19th and early 20th centuries in extremely crowded conditions. 
(Easier to conjure up images from my players this way.)

So, revised criteria:  As above, but not transported under Cold 
Sleep.  Use small staterooms, and cram four to a set.  (They may even 
have to sleep in rotation.)  Ugly and not very humanitarian, but I 
don\'t picture Terra\'s early colonization efforts pre-IW as a pretty, 
happy time for lower/middle class colonists, so it fits the milieu\'s 
world view.

Thanks, Everyone,

Wow! now that\'s what I call conspicuous spacial consuption.  And I thought
my 8 ton "Dining Salon" to which a few players objected ("can we pack cargo
in there?","Sure, but you\'ll scratch up the teak") was significant "waste"
space.

A bit of advice, unless the character would never concience such a thing,
be sure to provide dimensional measurements for the entrance(s) to the
room.  They may want to sneak a cargo container in there, at which point
you can say "sorry, the entrance is 2 meters by 3 meters and a cargo
container is 4 meters by 3 meters...want to take the walls down?"

I really think you need to add a descriptive chunk of text to this ship\'s
description.

You\'re confusing the acceleration of the rampart due to it\'s engine
thrust (6 G) with the turning ability of the F22 - which can basically
be thought of as the ability of its wings, not its engine, to exert
a force (at right angles to its velocity) to make it turn. This is indeed
a very large number; they\'re big wings with a lot of air flowing over
them. However, it\'s apples and oranges. The acceleration that an F22\'s
engine provides is more like 1.5G (much less than a Rampart); and in
an atmosphere, a Rampart\'s wings would provide a similar turning 
ability (a reason to by airframe hulls...)

that the Project: StarRise M:E21 campaign is officially slated to
begin in three weeks, on Wed, 04/14/99.  The first session will be a
sample adventure using pregenerated characters, to give all players
a chance to get to know the MegaTraveller rules system (I prefer it
to T4, GT, or TNE) and each other.  On 04/21/99, I will begin with
the actual PCs and a First Contact adventure with the Vilani. 
(Barnard\'s Star, here we come!)

Are there any Travellers in the Austin, TX area who would be 
interested in joining us for an exploration into Terra\'s first steps 
into space?  If so, please feel free to write to me privately, before 
04/14/99.

This will take some analysis of its viability.

A couple of threads have been talking about whether characters should be

the solution to this is simple:  The enemies you encounter are scaled to
your firepower.  Of course, that means that if you have an FGMP, the bad

Also, whilst the F22 pilots are killing themselves in a 12G turn or loop,
a happy fun ball is just flying along in a stright line, spinning
on its axis, pulling almost 0G, whilst keeping its weapons pointed
straight at the F22 because it does not need to generate lift
(a reason to have streamlined but non-airframe hulls...).

Pah!

The Pioneer X exploration ship has 2 such "function rooms" on the main
ship and another in one of the pods.

What _my_ players objected to was that the Noble\'s stateroom was 48std
(plus another 48std in one of the pods)

After the pilot complained "The Noble\'s bath is bigger than my stateroom"
and threatened that the Noble would be the first to go, my only reasonable
course of action was to make Marquise Alia Usssuul (head of the Emerging
Technologies Division) a dolphin and flood the whole volume.

I want to see Jesse\'s Scout Courier shot against the gas giant on the back
of a black T-shirt with the red "Traveller" logo on the pocket area of the
front.

With all that AWESOME artwork laying around, they go with a plain text
T-shirt with the sunburst on it? I hope they decide to do more.

    'body' => 'Fellow Travellers,

I\'ve been reviewing the World Data from Andrew M-V\'s Interstellar 
Wars data, trying to figure out the relative order of contact of 
various worlds during the early expansion and exploration of the 
United Nations into interstellar space.  I made the assumption that 
the Terran explorers were J-1, with enough fuel to make two jumps 
without refueling.  With this assumption, the following worlds would 
probably have been explored/contacted in the something resembling the 
order presented.  Once we reach the end of the list, the Terrans 
required either a J-1 vessel with fuel for three jumps before 
refueling, or an established Deep Space Station to serve as a 
refueling point and starting point for future explorations.  So 
without further adieu, here\'s a list of Terran Exploration "Waves" 
during the years 2096 to 2110AD, at least IMTU.

Wave 1: Barnard/Ikugi, Prometheus, Peraspera, Junction

Wave 2: Midway

Wave 2.5: Hades (via Midway); Ember, Loki (via Prometheus, Peraspera)

Wave 3: Hephaistos, Calgary, Inferno (via Hades); Dismal (via Loki);
Fenris (via Junction)

Wave 4: Sirius, Ys (via Fenris)

Wave 5: Encounter the Ziru Sirka borders, thus stopping expansion in 
this direction (via Sirius); Remulak, Sarpeddon (via Ys)

Wave 6: Mirabilis (via Sarpeddon) 

IMTU, each world has been credited with first survey by 
various governments in the following timeline:

Barnard: 13 Sep 2096 (by USS StarLeaper I)
Prometheus:  20 Oct 2096 (by ESS Prometheus Rising)
Peraspera:  24 Nov 2096 (by ESS Prometheus Rising)
Junction:  20 Dec 2096 (by ESS Prometheus Rising)

[Historical note: the USS StarLeaper I arrived in Junction system 
only six days after the ESA\'s Prometheus Rising.  The ESA\'s control 
over Deep Space Station Europa (SolRim 1928), combined with the 
retrieval of StarLeaper I from Barnard, allowed the ESA the upper 
hand that allowed for their first survey of Junction.  The ESS 
Prometheus Rising was lost in misjump shortly after reporting their 
findings.  Foul play is not suspected.]

Hades:  25 Apr 2097 (by USS StarLeaper I)

At this time, I have not completed the general timeline of events for 
my campaign, so the remaining worlds do not have "official" first 
survey times as yet.  Colonization, of course, begins somewhat later. 
 So far, the only colonies I have established as having been founded 
are:

US Barnard Colony (Barnard/Sol) established on 5 Aug 2097.
ESA Prometheus Colony (Prometheus/Sol) established on 15 Sep 2097.

The rest of the history is forming, so that I have a guideline to go 
by, and so that I can make sure to cover specific events with the 
players as they occur.  PCs can, of course, change the actual flow of 
events and thus, the course of history, but I\'m starting with the 
"official" timeline, as augmented by Andrew M-V and Rob Eaglestone, 
as the basis for my campaign.  (Just in case they play nice and stay 
within the lines.  :)

If anyone is interested, I\'ll post it when it\'s complete.  (With the 
level of detail I\'m trying to go into, it may be awhile, though.)  
It\'s intended to cover the time period from First Contact to the 
Barnard Incident.

I\'ll keep you posted.

Jason

PS The ESA\'s first explorer/scout vessel was named for Andrew M-V\'s 
campaign, of course.  Thanks for the inspiration and direction, 
Andrew.

The ship\'s gotta have something to sit on when it lands. I certainly
can\'t see them just sitting on the hull, tipped over.

Science doesn\'t say we can\'t. If you are not capable of acceleration
(or choose not to at all) they you are right, you\'d have to vaporize
the slug (warhead, whatever) far enough away that the plasma is no
danger.

In reality the weapon would have to be constantly accelerating until
it is very close to the target in order to actually hit since thet
target will be acclerating or evading. So as soon as you knock out
the sensors on the missile, or its propulsion system (the former is
very easy since the sensor is fragile and *must* point at the
target) the missile will miss unless the target is not accelerating.

I think rules should include a way to deal with surprised, or
otherwise non-accelerating targets, mind you. (rule would say "BOOM,
yer dead" :-)

So the bottom line is that KKMs are fairly easy to mission kill with
PDF (damn adobe ;-), under normal combat conditions (maneuvering
target), and damn near impossible to mission kill under non-typical
conditions (coasting targets).

This leads me to the following question.

Since missiles are definitely part of Traveller,
missiles with a pumped laser warhead are more
effective than KKMs, and the Imperium won\'t
allow nukes, is there any other way to pump a
laser warhead to the point of making it effective
while avoiding the use of a nuke?

Sorry about the basic question but I\'m not
weapons-systems literate at all.

I woudl say that science says they can too, and would be happy to debate

For vehicle combat, what you\'re saying makes perfect sense, but not for
Traveller space combat, as we know it (general assumptions only- long range
and long duration turns).  More than 2 uncompensated G\'s (count G-tanks and
accel couches as compensation, as well as \'real\' G comp) for 20-30 minutes at
a time.  Yeah, you might be able to survive 12G\'s for 45 seconds, but that\'s
petty compared to the scope of space combat and the same pilot will be jelly
after 30 minutes at 12Gs.

In space, you get your minute bursts of 12Gs (most of which is from lift, by
the wings and canards, etc IIRC and not from actual thrust).  I use half of my
6 on evasion and when your burst is done and you momentarily can\'t effectively
alter your vector, I either pop a det missile on you or zap u up to my ROF
with my laser lance.

Not when I blast your F22 from orbit with my laser lance.  Or when I blast you
from  *missile* range in the atmosphere w/ the same laser (and then the
missiles).  If i\'m not completely careless, I\'ll know you\'re coming when you
take off.  I\'m in a *space* fighter after all and should have some
intelligence on enemy COACC activity.

An airframed space fighter (if not a dedicated aerospace fighter), which will
get the same lift advantages that an aerospace fighter does, would be desired
if a dogfight w/ the F22 was going to be attempted.  It\'s much easier to fry
the F22 from far outside its own range and play a different game rather than
on the F22\'s terms.

Course, the Rampart as presented (excepting the 15dt RF-128 and 128-2 from
Azhanti High Lightning, which I have a good (IMO) FF&S conversion of on my
FF&S web page) in MT and BL sucks big time.

My first Ref called it an SS Gun, short for Secret Service.  I have
never read about the actual one in Logan\'s Run, but his was set to
recognize the user (a la Lost in Space) and would do 3d6 damage as it
self-destructed in the hands of any other user.  IIRC, his version could
not be loaded with individual rounds, like all homer, but could hold
just one of each.

Has anyone done a Traveller conversion for the Gun?  Somewhere in the
musty rearward chasms of my mind I seem to remember something similar...

I believe the actual name of the organization (Sandmen) was DS (Deep

Oh, yes...I would assume that UWP and location would be available as
standard library data on any ship. Whether that UWP is _accurate_ or
not, well..._that\'s_ a horse of a different color. IMTU, size, hydro and
atm are likely to be accurate, the others, being dependent much more on
human activity can, at best be regarded as a rough guide, Law and Gov in
particular can change quite rapidly.

Remember, the second Survey was done ca 800-1000 (IIRC) so in M1100, it
can be a least 100 years old.

From the SJ Games Wish List
<http://www.sjgames.com/general/author/capsules.html>:

"GURPS Traveller: Espionage 

"The Imperium is a treacherous nest of secret agents, diplomats and
operatives of organizations too black to name . . . and those are just the
locals! Once you factor in psionic Zhodani spies and fanatical Solomani
conspirators, things get really interesting. Espionage will deal with both
the public and private aspects of interstellar relations, covering
everything from the most shadowy spies to the most public (and pompous!)
ambassadors and consuls. It will describe the structure, capabilities and
resources of diplomatic corps, intelligence agencies (overt, covert and
clandestine), and terrorist and renegade groups. The practicalities of
diplomacy in a star-spanning culture will also be discussed. Finally, the
book will include advice on both espionage- and diplomacy-oriented
campaigns, adventure seeds for use in any kind of campaign, and expanded
character templates for diplomats and spies. The author of this book should
be familiar not only with GURPS Traveller, but also the original Classic
Traveller source material. 128 pages. 

"Other Notes: Espionage is definitely a working title! A book like this
certainly deserves a more exciting name, but we can\'t tell you more at your
current clearance level. "

They are actively soliciting proposals from anyone interested in writing
this (and other) sourcebooks.

The F22 can at best pull 2Gs in straight flight (12Gs would be
atmospheric manuevers) the rampart would runoff an leave any current
fighter behind including any current air-to-air missle.

It was. We ran it at GenCon Uk 97 (at 98 we ran Star Worn...). It worked a
treat, especially the bit when we took 18 of the 36 players (6 groups of
six) and simultaneously moved them to different games. Bugger to mark
though.

According to BTRC\'s 3G3 and More Guns the propellant energy of the Brown
Bess is about 1360 J, some reverse-engineering calculation from it\'s DV
shows it\' muzzle energy is some 1250 J. 

For comparison: 
5.56 NATO 1640-1960 J (depending on TL)
.30 carbine 1320 J
.44 magnum 1270-1400 J (depending on TL)
M-19A3 1816 J (RE\'d from weapon stats)
M1 carbine 1344 J (-..-)
S&W model 29 1012 J

btw. For those interested in conerting weapons from MT to G:T or vice
versa, both of aforementioned books can be used for this. (And in my
opinion the More Guns is easier to use in conversions.)

Dang it, I *knew* I was being brain-dead!

Thanks for the info, guys. I\'m cracking my copy of FFS2

I HATE it when I confuse it.  Bad example.

I\'ll stick by what I said about a ship being able to withstand lots of
Gs though.  :-)

Or I ram you taking advantage of my space grade armour, or I use contragrav

Well, it was a bad example.  But . . .
The F22 pilots aren\'t killing themselves in 12 G turns today,
at least with the experimental equipment, and certainly won\'t
be at higher TLs.  And the Rampart isn\'t going to hit anything
because its hull mounted lasers point forward.  Where the
enemy isn\'t likely to be for long.

The problem with real art on a T-shirt is
1) its more expensive, and
2) One person\'s Sulieman is another person\'s Donsonev.

Collars.  Not a good idea.  Ask anyone who plays Rugby.
Rugby has them for tradition, I guess.  Smart players tuck
them under, I think Rugby League for rid of them.

It hurts to be tackled by them.  I think the future would learn.

Wow! Best idea I\'ve yet seen for aligning the various j-drive
"explanations". Now we just need to tie the mechanics together - eg.
     - the DGP rule that "more than 40% [?] of hull destroyed increases
       the likelihood of a misjump".
     - whether its possible to compensate for damage by "overdriving"
       a j-drive in a jump smaller than the drive\'s rating.
     - some sort of rule covering inefficient grids, as those of a jump
       ship wrapping its cables around cargo or if you forego the grid
       and just use the bubble to enclose your external cargo.

[Actually - you *did* mention this idea back in digest #92, this year.]

Well, CT _is_ the greatest ;-) but we are a mixed bag on here.  I\'m a
crusty old CT fart who liked T4 (serious minority) but dislikes T:TNE.
I\'m somewhat cool on MegaTraveller, too.  I\'m following the GURPS

a fairly large contingent of CT folks.

Thats only \'illegal\' in US law.  And even then, its not really a \'law\' but
an executive order, which has the force of law, until it is revoked.

\'Illegal\' and \'Black\' are different things, but I can envisage a scenario
when you would want it known that you had someone assassinated.

I agree that GravBall is probably a contact sport, but I\'ve always
equated it to Rugby rather than American football, and we all know
how much protective gear rugby players wear! :^)

Aside from the specifics of the game itself, it\'s extremely difficult
for me to add the kind of armored uniforms you suggest in Poser.  The

Actually, this is an interference with free trade, and as such specifically
protected by the Warrant of Restoration.

This is why piracy is outlawed (commerce raiding is just "legalised"
piracy).

As I said, it\'s only a minor quibble, because the effect is the same!

Douglas is right, the distinction is based on who takes the credit or blame
for the operation:

"white" operations -- I admit that I did it.
"black" operations -- I deny that I did it, and try to hide it if possible.
"gray" operations -- I try to make it look as if someone else did it.

There is also the overt/covert/clandestine distinction:

overt -- everyone knows about it; I wear my regular uniform (SF trains
troops in El Salvador)
covert -- no one is supposed to know about it, but I still wear my uniform
(SEALs recon Kuwait City)
clandestine -- no one is supposed to know about it, and I don\'t wear a
uniform at all

Interesting question.

Let\'s see.  Looking in the current copy of _PC Magazine_ [Volume 18,
Number 7, dated April 6, 1999], I find the Sony VAIO Slimtop desktop PC
on page 48.  The CPU measures 3.5" x 11" x 13.2".  Converting to metric
gives us (approximately) 8.9cm x 27.9cm x 33.5cm, or 8320cm^3.  One m^3
equals 1,000,000cm^3.  Therefore, one can fit approximately 120 VAIO
Slimtop CPUs into one m^3.  Since 1 dton equals 14m^3, this means that
one can fit approximately 1680 VAIOs in one dton.  Let\'s allow some room
for I/O devices, displays, and operator seating, and assume 1000 VAIOs,
with ancillary equipment, per dton.

Now, the VAIO Slimtop is powered by a Pentium III running at 500 MHz,
with 128 MB of SDRAM, and sports a 10.8 GB hard disk.  Surely this can
run the Windows version of Acrobat Exchange.

A Model 1/bis computer from CT, requiring 1 dton of space, can handle 4
CPU slots worth of programs.  Therefore, Acrobat Exchange requires no
more than 4/1000, or 1/250, or .004 CPU slot.

As a result, you can, by running 250 windows worth of Acrobat Exchange
in one CPU slot, destroy 250 missiles per turn.

The question is, of course, guaranteed to have gray areas. 
Those gray areas are where all sorts of adventures can grow. 
:)

MT World Builder\'s Handbook does address the question. This 
is apparently a major part of the survey job of the IISS. 

From WBH:
"Imperial xenologists find that three areas of development
must interact to bring a species to the level labeled as 
\'sentient\'. These are: language, social structure, and 
tools (environmental manipulation, in whatever manner is
physically possible for that specific race)."

It then goes on to describe different levels of language,
considered as evidence of conceptual thought; of social 
structure, and of tool use. Various unusual cases and 
exceptions are mentioned. I\'m not typing the rest of it 
in. :)

earlier was her first ship to celebrate her new-found freedom (a.k.a.

ship would better fill her needs.  In addition, a TL15 yacht design
would be marketable to the Imperial Navy as a VIP transport or (by
replacing the ballroom with a Combat Information Center) a C^3I ship. 
This market would only be enhanced by the ship\'s impressive sensor and
ECM suite, and stealthing/EMM masking, all of which were originally
intended to help the Noble purchaser avoid pirates.  Of course, for
Naval purchases, the stock Chameleon coating can easily be replaced by
Ultra-Black.  The design already sports a useful self-defense armament,

That\'s the Logan\'s Run gun down to a \'T\'.  The cylinder was a throw away as
I recall that was tossed when you were done with it.

    I use the MT & CT rules to run my game.  I love the CT setting & about
half of the rules, but, I like the way you can use, in MT, Free Traders to

That\'s a very good question, and I\'m not going to answer it (at least
not with until His Imperial Majesty flips the meter on so that I\'ll get
my Cr300/hour for legislative drafting).  I think that the definition
will be in an early Imperial edict, rather than some other source of
law, and I\'m sure that Cleon and especially his legal/political staff
will have spent some time thinking hard about it.  

Here are some issues that I would raise (in no particular order) if I
were privileged to participate in those meetings:

1)  We humans and the other major races all include self-awareness as an
essential characteristic of a sophont.  Is that objectively reasonable?  

2)  Assuming that it is, what level of self-awareness is required?  How
can it be quantified?

3)  The roots of sophont are the Greek words "sophos", meaning "clever",
and "sophia", meaning "skill".  Does that help our analysis?

4)  Aside from self-awareness, what other characteristics make up a
sophont?  Abstract reasoning?  Linguistic processing?  Tool making? 
Economic life?  Planning for the future?  Must all characteristics be
present, or can the presence of some or even only one be enough?  How
can they be measured?

5)  Political issues:  Who\'s going to decide each new case?  Who will
advocate for and against Imperial citizenship?  With respect to old
cases, does Cleon have supporters who practice slavery and need to have
their slaves deemed non-sophonts?  Is Cleon willing to do this, or would
he consider it better to alienate the slave-holders and get the support
of the ex-slaves?

Thanks, Jeff, for opening a really interesting and important line of
inquiry.

parsecs without refueling.  It does this the same way that the multistage

addition to crew quarters, cargo/low berths, etc.) a jump drive capable of
moving the ship one parsec is surround by demountable fuel tanks.  It jumps
1 parsec and then drops off the now empty tankage, thereby reducing the
ship volume.  It then jumps again as a smaller volume ship, using less fuel
on each subsequent jump.  Since one use of this is to reach systems trapped
behind the lines, I call it a "blockade runner".  It might also be used to
jump small rifts.  In either case it won\'t carry much more than news,
orders, the most vital supplies, etc.

The ship contains a Core with
2 staterooms (to hold a pilot, navigator, and engineer), 8 spaces; a basic
bridge module, 2.5 spaces; 1 engineering module, 1 space; 20 jump drive
modules, 20 spaces; 10 maneuver modules, 10 spaces, 2 utility modules, 2
spaces; and 66 tons of cargo space for cargo and/or low berths.  The fuel
tankage is as follows....

It has an unstreamlined hull and can do Jump-1 and 0.5 Gs.  It masses 1863
tons.  It is not clear how you handle demountable tanks, but I assumed it
wouldn\'t change the volume significantly but double the cost of the jump
drive.  That puts the cost at 334 MCr and replacement of the tankage at 204
MCr.

Looks like the guy on the left is winding up for a side kick !

And I agree with Steve about the collars.

Though I\'d disagree with the armour as medical technology is good enough to
replace most damage
Possibly head protection though.

Sorry, I didn\'t find any good shots of Aeroball from the old 2000AD, it was a
slightly different game, and most of the shots  are side on.

Well she finally contacted me today, killed her with kindness, told herI still
loved her, and if we couldn\'t be married, then friends who
happened to share a wonderful son was more than enuff.

Besides, after all she gave the gift of my freedom after 18 mon. of

These are, BTW, not questions that apply only to Traveller, but which apply
right now in the real world.

Many people consider Down Syndrome such a disorder, and there is some research
suggesting that a true genetic "cure" could be produced.

But at the same time it has been shown that when the stigma of being
"retarded" is removed and people with DS are treated normally and their
special dietary and other requirements are catered for , they are quite
capable of living a productive healthy life, and even competing succesfully
against so-called "normal" people in intellectual pursuits.

The big question here is whether _anyone_  has the right to "cure" something
that is a natural occurence, and produces unique individuals who do not
"suffer".

Personally I believe that any attempt to "fix" such disorders will in the long
term reduce the capability of he human genome to survive, in the same way that
vegetables highly modified for cloour taste and yield are less able to
survibve in the wild. Similalry any attempt to modify mental health will, I
believe, have the same effect.

Sure, you\'ll get local maxima, where say a eugenics-based culture rises above
others, but I contend that they will be  local maxima, and ultimately slow or
prevent full development.

It\'s no coincidence that there is a stereotype of "mad professors", I would
suggest that the vast majority of those who have serioulsy advanced our
science, technology and culture, have been at least borderline psychotic if
not completely loony by "average man" standards.

Sometimes their insanity is of a form that we can admire, such as say, Jesus,
Ghandi or Martin Luther King,
but without all ends of the many mental spectrums, humanity as a whole becomes
weaker and less able to survive whatever the universe throws at us.

I suspect that while such enhancements would allow a futuristic person to
_seem_ more intelligent than say a modern person, they wouldn\'t really make
people "more intelligent", they\'d just be able to pass IQ tests better, and
find info faster, etc. Coming up with ideas...  well I suppose if the ability
to have ideas one day becomes tracked down to some hormone level....

And in fact, enhanced technology is having the reverse effect on the United
States, where all measures of intelligence are decreasing, and the decline in
"native" US intelligence is only just being  offset by imports of highly
intelligent people from India and Eastern Europe.

One reasoning  behind this is that people don\'t need intelligence to survive
in Western countries anymore, so it no longer serves an evolutionary purpose
and is thus being "bred out"

To keep it on topic, this might well explain all those stupid things in
Traveller like drop tanks and inefficient X-boat routes, the reason they
haven\'t been though of is because the average Imperial intelligence is far
lower than it is now, because they didn\'t need it. It would also explain the
huge devastation of the Long Night and then later the Virus. The Long noght
caused people to start getting intelligent again, but when they suceeded in
getting the Third Imperium, they didn\'t need it anymore and lost it, so that
when Virus came along.....

Well, alright it;s pushing it a bit, but all that low passaging must have had
some affect on the Imperium\'s average IQ   :-)

Then there\' sthose that feel the reason for humanity is to create our
successors out of silicon, such as Hans Moravec. He might be right.

Anyone ever consider that Virus was the good guys ?

The point was that a space fighter doesn\'t need to loop because
it isn\'t actually flying. So it can just spin on its axis.
A pilot placed at the centre of the space fighter will experience
almost no G whilst doing 60 rpm, so the problem for the F22 pilot
is that whatever manoeuvre they perform, the space fighter will
still be pointing lasers directly at them.

Obviously, the F22 pilot could break left instead of right, but
there is nothing in the dynamics that stops you pointing at them.

Finally there is an assumption in Traveller that even spinal mounts
can be pointed slightly off axis by the targeting mechanism.

I\'d agree with streamlined ships buying up to 10G of structure.

Even more for those hypersonic designs trying to gas giant refuel.

It was mentioned in connection to the John Glenn flight, Gemini was 7G

This brings up some interesting problems.  As you suggest, many species will
have some, but not all of these abilities.  As I recall, dolphins are
mentioned in some Traveller material as being sophonts.  I will grant that
even today we might conceivably attribute dophins with the capability of
abstract reasoning and linguistic processing.  I would even go so far as to
say dolphins would be (are) capable of _using_ tools.  However, due to
dolphin physiology (most notably a lack of manipulative appendages), they
would be hard pressed to _make_ tools. That is, they can use tools which are
provided to them, but are unable to create tools to begin with.  Thus
species such as dolphins would be dependent on other species to create tools
for them.  Would this affect their ability to gain sophont status?  Is the
ability to make tools simply another human-centric measurement of
intelligence?  (Another way for humaniti to reassure itself that it is
indeed the dominant lifeform in the galaxy?)

IIRC, The tool making problem does not apply to dolphins because they
were genetically engineered by humans to allow them to press buttons
with "fingers" on their flippers.

In general, if you can use a tool, surely you can use that tool to make
another tool.

By the time you can control computers by thought or speech, and
use those computers to run fully automated factories on the other
side of the system, the ability to make a flint hand axe by
bashing two rocks together seems a bit quaint.

Sort of.

The problme is that the Rules of War arent really rules, they are guidelines.

I agree, the probability is that most of the time in most places, the
Imperial Authorities would argue that \'No-one makes war in space but us\'.

On the other hand, governments often do silly things that seemed like a
good idea at the time, and selling off licences for Commerce Raiders in
legitimate intra-Imperium conflicts strikes me as a good way of keeping the
local Imperial Admiral in the lifestyle to which he has become accustomed.

Huh? Since the drives on most ships can\'t *reach* 10 gees, what\'s the
point? 

Also, if it\'ll withstand a given acceleration for *one* minute, it\'ll
likely handle it for 10 minutes, or even 10 *days*.

But that data doesn\'t apply to a spacecraft. The accelerations in tight
*aircraft* manuevers are due to using control surfaces agianst the
atmosphere to turn. 

But in space, the direction of travel, and the orientation of the ship
are *not* linked. Turning the *ship* can be done with steering jets and
fairly *low* accelerations. 

Changing *course*, requires using the main drive. And, it just so
happens that accel from the main drive will *always* be in the same
direction *relative to the ship*. 

So when you change course there will be a *slight* sideways accel as
the ship\'s nose is pointed in the correct direction (and not the one
you might think!), but the main accel will continue to be from the nose
to the tail.

Also, the g forces on aircraft tend to be from the pilot\'s head to his
feet. Except for a few manuevers where it\'s from his feet to his head. 
In the former case, 10g is substantial and only endurable for seconds.
In the latter *3* gs is dangerous.

If you are in a proper acceleration couch in a space fighter (or a ship
with decks properly oriented with respect to the drive), the
acceleration will be from your chest to your back. In this position 10
gees is sustainable for minutes. Maybe longer.

The shuttle stays around 3-4 g. That\'s one of the reasons "civilians"
are allowed.

Don\'t bet on it. They are about as "frail" as a battleship.

Having a 1g rating means they are as "fast" as an F-15 eagle. They can
boost *straight up* and keep climbing indefinitely. Try that in your
airplane. At 2G, they can go from ground level to 100,000 feet in 79
seconds. 

> Heck, most modern military fighters would circles around a Rampart fighter.

You are confusing two *very* different things. Very few aircraft are
capable of *accelerating* at much more than 1 g. They are the ones
where the pilot can point the nose straight up and keep going until the
engine flames out from lack of air. A 6g space fighter will outrun one
of those *easily*.

The g rating *you* are thinking of are forces induced by using the
*atmosphere* to turn. As I pointed out above, it doesn\'t work that way
in space. Turning your ship does *not* alter your course.

That 12 gees defines how sharply your F22 can *turn*. Not how fast you
can *accelerate*. As I recall, the F22 barely exceeds *one* g for
acceleration.

Consider that the Rampart has engine thrust equal to 6 times its
deadweight. That means that it can go from 0 to mach 5 in 28 seconds.
And reach mach *25* another 2 minutes. And keep right on going. And it
can do almost as well going straight up!

The limits on a Rampart\'s *turning* (in atmosphere) are going to be the
same as your F22. How many *transverse* gees the *pilot* can take.

> Give me some Hi-G missiles.  Heck, 50 calibers, with some 30mm cannon.
> Good bye Rampart.

Hardly. How are you going to deal with a "plane" that goes zipping by
at mach 25? That\'s roughly 5 miles a *second*. Your guns are useless,
because the Rampart is flying faster than the muzzle velocity. Your
missiles are equally useless, since their top speed is too slow, and
it\'ll be out of range long before they get up to it.

Again, the G-rating for ships and the g-ratings for aircraft are
measuring *totally* different things. 

Think of a ship\'s g-rating as being the same as the "thrust to weight
ratio" of a fighter. When you look at it that way *then* you realize
that 6g is *awesome*.

Why bother? As I noted, a Rampart can zip by at Mach 25. The shock wave
alone would shred the F22, and probably at several miles range!

What else can provide enough g-turns of acceleration? And if there *is*

The problem is the energy requirements. Chemical lasers exist, but the
amount of chemicals required is rather large.

Sorry, but the resolution argument doesn\'t work. What *resolution*
means is that you couldn\'t tell if what you were seeing was one missile
or a pair flying in "close" formation.

For example, *stars* are far below the resolution of the naked eye. But
you can still see them. And as soon as it tries to make a course
corection (which is *required* if it\'s going to have a chance of
hitting) it\'ll be *damned* visible.

Also, any engine capable of boosting it at that rate is going to leave
the missile quite hot. It\'ll stick out like a sore thumb.

Remember, a "combat hex" is something like 30,000 km.

It\'ll be "in range" for *minutes*. At 1000 km/sec it takes 30 seconds
to cross one hex.

What makes you think "science" says they can\'t?

Consider that the laser does *not* have to destroy the missile. It
merely has to knock out the sensors or drive. Do either one and you\'ve
got a virtuallyu *guaranteed* miss.

Consider the angle subsumed by the target ship at a range of a mere
thousand km. If the missiles path is outside that angle, it\'ll miss.
Likewise, if the ship makes a *small* course or position change, the
same is true. 

A kinetic kill missile *cannot* hit without active guidance. And *that*
is what the laser can knock out.

I\'ve done the same thing before as well.

Another alternative is to give them the weapon, and design an adventure 
to acquire the armor.
Then once the marine is ready to go into the thickest of battles blazing 
hellfire all the way, make sure the next 10 combats or so are small arms 
fire onboard the player\'s ship, or are over before donning the armor is

I\'ve played all of them, though I seem to be leaning back over to CT
again.  Perhaps I\'m beginning to atone for my earlier heresies.  Hmmm,
NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!  I still love the original CT, no Imperium, it was all
original creations of the players.

A couple of problems here.  The rampart as drawn does not have the wing
surface to turn in the atmosphere with an F16 or any other fighter.  In the
atmosphere aerodynamics are what count.  With enough power a brick can fly
but it can do so well.  To make up for this lack of control surface the
rampart will have to use part of it\'s g capacity for manuvering and even in
the pilot is in the center of mass for the rampart he will feel every bit of
the acceleration/deceleration Gs.  Also does CG and thruster plates have
that fine a control in every direction without reorienting the drives
facing?  CG can cancel gravity but that is about it.  Can thrusters thrust
in any direction regardless of physical location and orientaion?  What
happens when the pilot is in the path of the thrust?  Is he pushed away by
the thruster?  If thruster are basic rockets without phisical exhaust (GT
seems to suggest this with their \'vectored thrust\' moddel) then thrusters
have little advantage over jets.  A Rampart would have to turn to change the
direction of it\'s acceleration just like a F16 as it\'s thrust is
unidirectional like a jets.  Those turns take time just like for the
fighter.  If this is how thrusters work then their only advantage over jets
is that the have not physical exhaust.

Next, while a rampart could be going mach 25 in space I dought that it could
do so in the atmosphere for more than the few seconds that reentry interface
takes to brake it.  The heat caused by air friction at that speed would melt
titanium if it were maitained for any real length of time.

Third, what is to stop the fighter form mounting lasers?  The fighter has a
great advantage in lift.  It\'s engines do not have to produce enough thrust
to push it into orbit.  If it flies, it works, so it can have a much greater
\'war load.\'  Also who says that an aero fighter can not use thruster plates
and CG?  A fighter purpose build to fight in a planets atmosphere will
defeat a space fighter of the same tech level IN the atmosphere with all
other things being equal. It\'s weapons and sensors will be optomised for the
atmosphere.  The space fighters for space.  I find it a bit hard to believe
the space sensors have the same range and resolution in the atmosphere.
From what I know about the design of space base sensors they are huge
disperse structures that would be shreaded if they were deployed durring
atmospheric flight.

Forth, AA weapons.  Very mobile CG platforms for LOS AA batteries with VHROF
(lasers, PAWs, Meson guns).  Easy to move and hide.  The ramparts would be
clay pigeons anywhere in LOS.  See David Drake\'s \'coliape\' (vulcan plazma
cannon) AA power gun systems for what such a system could do.  A power gun
is just a chemically pumped plasma weapon.

mercinary campains.

Reminds me of a quote: "the intelligence of the universe is a constant;
the population keeps increasing."

What is insanity, btw? It\'s usually defined by a society, as in "marked
deviation from the cultural norms", making anyone sufficiently different
"insane". Bottom line, there is no final arbiter of insanity or sanity,
only as measured against the present society. The only unchangeable
standard I can think of is Darwinian evolution.

As to Frank Pitt\'s suggestion that intelligence is being bred out of
modern Western society, how do you account for the breakthroughs in
genetics and world wide communciations, which happened primarily in the
West? On your theory, the Chinese would be the lowest intellectually,
since their culture for millenia has been one of being satisfied with
the status quo (the theory being that they\'re already a perfect society,
so why embrace the new?). That\'s what allowed Europe to dominate the
last few centuries--Europeans broke free of the religious suppression of
knowledge and followed what they considered "common sense" (meaning
experiment and observation--true, much of their common sense was wrong,
but they were trying, and we still are).

I don\'t think you can breed out intelligence--perhaps our society needs
to redefine successful evolutionary strategies instead. We make
dim-witted people rich and famous for playing a sport well, when most
scientists live in obscurity. Denis (SP?) Rodman isn\'t a genius, he\'s
just eccentric and way to wealthy compared to his positive impact on
society. Monica Lewinsky, whose genetic code would probably serve the
human race best if left in obscurity, is now a star. Need I continue?

Back to Traveller: in a space-based society, "basic knowledge" would
include such things as trigonometry. Anyone working and living in space
would have to have an intuitive feel for the relative motions of bodies
in zero g. Those who didn\'t have the "proper brain structure" (i avoid
using the word "intelligence" here) to properly intuit the physics of
relative motion (and perhaps perform complex trigonometric calculations
in their heads) would tend to remain planet-bound or would consider
space to be like an ocean was to 19c passengers--something to buy a
ticket to get across, but little else.

Ok, Leonard, you\'ve caused a number of questions
to bubble out of my ignorant brain. :-)

Is it possible to have a missile designed so that
it receives guidance from the launching ship using
the missile\'s "skin" as a receiving antenna for, say,
pre-specified guidance frequencies?

If so, can it also be designed to have its skin
act as the antenna for one or more armored passive
sensor processors placed deep within the missile for
protection?

If both of the above are true, why not let the
launching ship guide the missile to its target
and then allow the missile to home during the
terminal approach on the target?

I understand the "skin" sensor must have a bottom
limit to its surface area and sensitivity but can\'t
incoming laser shots be used to home in on a target,
assuming the missile survives them? If one section of
skin is carbonized, have the onboard processors keep

Is there a difference between laser energy frequencies
and cosmic energy frequencies which could make this
viable at high TLs?

Of course, the last question above assumes a single
target doing the PD firing. Multiple PD sources would
just result in a very confused (or dead) missle,
wouldn\'t it?

You\'re both missing a critical point: G\'s measures acceleration, but
when you\'re in combat, RELATIVE SPEED is the critical factor. 

Using your example, if you attack a Rampart fighter, it doesn\'t matter
how fast it\'s accelerating, it matters how fast it\'s going at the moment
you shoot. the Delta between your and its *actual velocity* is what is
important. G-factor indicates  rate of acceleration (how fast it can
change speeds), not an actual velocity.

To get a good feel for how relative speeds can be simulated in a
boardgame, try a game of Star Fleet Battles.

Dolphins are covered under Best of the JTAS Vol 2 and in Traveller 
Digest #13 (or maybe 15, I can\'t remember which one has the Terra 
info in it.)

From what I recall, Dolphins don\'t have much genetic manipulation to 
give them "fingers" on fins, simply a bit more heightened intellect.  
However, they do use "waldos" built by the Solomani to make other 
tools, they do communicate through language, and they do exhibit the 
capacity to solve problems.  And that seems to fit the bill defined 
under WBH for the sentience question.

This is interesting. I can see every downport having a large armory with
individual lockable lockers, so all the PC\'s can deposit their weapons before
they leave the port. I wonder how long it will take for some wiseass party of
PC\'s to rob the armory...?

Well, since the scouts who first investigated the system containing
these so called \'fuzzy sapiens\' were clearly insane and hallucinating, I
propose we red-zone the system, and hope they go away...;-)

Seriously, it gets hard to define, as things get (forgive me) really
fuzzy along the edges.

All of the mentioned aspects (tools, language, culture, self awareness,
temporal awareness) are _signs_ of sentience. Classification as a
sophont under Imperial law, will be up to the survey teams and
supervisors in the IISS units investigating the system. I would guess,
that they would certainly tend to err on the side of caution.

Now, since lifeforms useful enough to be slaves will certainly show
enough signs to be classified as sophonts by just about anyone, it\'s
unlikely that this will show up, at all. (In fact, I suspect the
greatest incidence of slavery will be precisely what we have here on
earth today... indentured servitude or so-called contract laborers...a
real gray area of the law in most places)

The areas of greatest concern over sophont classification will be over
lifeforms that happen to be living on valuable resources, and will
revolve around whether they have to be paid, protected or just oopsed
away.

This will certainly be less influenced by strictly scientific concerns
than by political and economic ones (in the Imperium, often one and the
same.) I\'m sure there will be powerful interests in the Imperium behind
preservation of native cultures and ecosystems, just as there will be
powerful interests in favor of resource exploitation whereever they can
be found.

These opposing forces will certainly make themselves felt on the IISS,
often at the same time.

"This is an EX-PC! If it weren\'t nailed to the character sheet it\'d be

I suspect retribution would be swift and extremely nasty for any party
willing to try that...remember the downport is Imperial territory. Plus,
you\'ve just pissed off a large number of characters who carry guns they
have to lock up on regular occasion...

First, I know that the standard SC has a "landing gear" but I do not see that they 
are a must. If you are not landing on a tl10 starport with gravplates and 
manipulators and on water, You still have your extrem strong hull to sit down on 
it.

If You still insist on something like landing gears, why don\'t you ad something 
like not movable, extremly hardend extensions (not like a heli more like a small 
pondon)?

Ah, this gets into the philosophy. :-)

Here I am referring not to an increase in I.Q., but to actual enhancement
of proccessing capability. Although there is yet to be a definitive
distillation of just what "intelligence" is, there is general agreement
that there is *something* there, and that it varies from individual to
individual. The difficulty in definition is most likely that there are
probably several tens of different variables that play into what we call
intelligence.

Certainly part of intelligence is determined by environmental factors (a
person can be taught good thinking habits such as logic, critical thinking,
etc.), but there also seem to be clear physiological components. Some
people just seem to be able to think more clearly, quickly, and with more
depth than others. (In computer terms, some people just have faster
processors than others. Mine\'s a 286-SX, unfortunately! ;-))

That\'s always what I considered Trav INT to represent, and why it was
seperated from EDU in the game.

It is this processing power that high technology might enhance, and this is
what I was talking about. Of course, all the advanced cyber-enhancements
and brain-therapy in the world won\'t teach a person good thinking habits.
Furthermore, it seems that bad thinking habits can actually change the
physiological makeup of the brain (i.e., how the neural connections run).
There is a feedback loop involved, and errors on either side might be
involved in causing a breakdown of function. So perhaps high-tech society
could start everyone out with a perfect brain, but environmental effects
would cause individual differences.

Unless, that is, the science is so advanced that they can make changes as a
person develops. Here, of course, we get into ethical problems, as you
mentioned. What to correct, and when?


>Coming up with ideas...  well I suppose if the ability

Creativity may or may not fall under the definition of intelligence,
depending on who you ask. Actually, a lot of things in psychology depend on
who you ask, which is why it\'s considered such an unrigorous, "squishy"
science by the more hard science types out there (and the reason I bugged
out on getting my Master\'s in cognitive psych -- if I\'m gonna be squishy, I
might as well be an artist).

In game terms, I leave creativity out of INT, and leave that up to the player.
Creativity is not something that lends itself well to statistical analysis
in RPGs. I can quite easily compensate for a player who has a character
smarter than he is by simply giving him more information. This simulates
his ability to deduce things clearly, quickly, and correctly. I have a
harder time making a character more creative than the player is, though.

I concede both points ( in general :)  However, I was thinking that an
intelligent species (capable of a language-but nothing similiar to human
speech - ultrasound, clicks, low-frequency sound, etc.) that had no
manipulative appendages with which to build tools, would be difficult to
recognize as a sophont.  They would most likely be living in their original
habitat, and so they might appear to be wild animals.  Real Life (tm)
dolphins make a good example.  They can\'t build tools, but they can use
tools given to them by man.

I think it would be very easy to dismiss an intelligent race, simply because
of physiological restrictions.

Bear in mind he has 6G compensation which means he can pull more G\'s than
the F22 pilot.

You\'re forgetting G compensators as well as contragrav and thrusters.

A contragrav ship floats. It requires no lift. The T-plate can apply
vectored thrust (SOpM) to some degree. The Rampart does have small wing
surfaces to help to. Thus that 6G can be used to manuever.

No, it hovers, burns the 6G to point at the F22, hits it with a light speed
weapon (or the ionisation shock). You are making the assumption that a
space craft with advanced technology will behave the same way as a fighter,
which is flawed IMO.

Anyway, a sane person would either (a) kill the F22 at range from space or
(b) send a Trepida to do the work.

Thruster operation is only defined in one source at the manuever level, and
that is the SOpM.

Fair point.

>Third, what is to stop the fighter form mounting lasers?

Ahem. Aside from the fact that this example was a F22 against a Rampart? If
you want to change the frame of the discussion, that\'s fine. An F22
couldn\'t generate enough power for the 250Mw laser.

> The fighter has a

>to push it into orbit.

No advantage at all. It needs forward motion to allow air to pass over the
wing surfaces to generate lift, which is why planes stall.

The Rampart has contragrav which means it doesn\'t have to spend engine
thrust pushing into orbit. It *floats* and can rise with high enough CG.

Additionally, a wing based airbreathing engine like that on the F22 isn\'t
going to be much use in orbit.

Nope. See above.

Have some more missiles if you want but I\'ll take the Rampart and the laser
battery.


>Also who says that an aero fighter can not use thruster plates
>and CG?

No one. That wasn\'t the context of this discussion though. If you want to
discuss a TL15 air fighter against a TL15 space fighter, fine.

Why? The active set from a space vessel is going to be way more powerful
than an air based set.

All things being equal, there may be an advantage to a fighter optimised
for atmosphere,but it probably won\'t look like a F22, which needs to
generate lift to work.

Read COACC if you can get a copy.

PAWs have a problem in atmospheres.

Taking a planet is going to be hard, I agree, but your argument has
wandered from why a (TL8) F22 is better than a (TL15) Rampart in an
atmosphere to why a TL15 Rampart will most likely be destroyed if attacking
a TL15 world with TL15 designed airspace fighters.

BTW I believe a TL15 airsuperiority fighter is more likely to be a sphere
than a plane.

  For initial guidance it\'s OK to have a receiver that simply doesn\'t face
the target or "adjacent" PD establishments. Later on light lag becomes a
very serious issue for a missile that needs to contact; a det laser might
be able to get by with peeking for only a few seconds as it deploys the
Xaser rods - a bad time to take a hit, though.

  I\'m not sure what you mean, but if the skin is the receiver, then its\'
getting cooked will still screw your sensors.

Maybe, maybe not.  The DOE is still funding magnetic confinement fusion
(which means I still have a job) to the tune of well over $200 million a
year (a pittance in federal budget terms, but about what its been).

I just hope that article doesn\'t make people think that larger fusion
programs are unecessary.  Not only is the work of fusion research important
to developing fusion power, its also been a catalyst for many other
inventions and uses in related areas (plasma science, magnetics,
magnetohydrodynamics, etc).

Reading the article though, it seems more like "good press" than "bad
press".  I wonder what my boss will say when he gets back from that
conference.

Note that the type of fusion described is "Inertial Confinement" fusion,
whereas the fusion usually associated with the Traveller concept is
"magnetic confinement" fusion, like what is done here at MIT.

Also note that "Cold Fusion" has not really weathered the test of time so
far.  Although there are still some advocates, it is generally not
considered "Fusion" any more.

Another issue to raise:  What about uplifted species?  Would the

denied the use of its new product?

(Well, of course I\'d never reject the offer of a higher fee, but that
amount does seem reasonable to me -- a Soc 9 or A professional with a
lot of experience, engaged to do complex work, but not in a crisis
setting or under unreasonable or even unusual time pressures.  On the
other hand, the people whom Cleon will actually have dealing with this
problem are all probably Soc C+, and are not billing by the hour. 
Rather, they\'re just doing their duty to the Imperium and to Cleon, and
their rewards are the doing itself and being part of the historical
record.  Besides which, they get all the advantages of being Imperial
nobility -- especially land in various forms -- so they would hardly
seek monetary fee.)

I usually use MT rules, especially the task system.  My campaigns are
usually set in the Spinward Marches before, during, or just after the
Fifth Frontier War, so the background is solidly CT.  As I\'ve gotten
older and busier with other things in my life (as Les Howie once
remarked, "In life, you can have two of the following three things: a
career, a love relationship, and enough time for gaming"; N.B.: that\'s
not an exact quotation, just my memory), I\'ve tended to try to use more
stuff "off the shelf", rather than designing every ship, planet, and
weapon system myself.  That way I can spend my referee time on what I\'m
good at, which is plot and mood development.

That\'s my Cr0.02.

Actually, I understand that it\'s well-documented cross-culturally that
the only factor that is always associated with reduction in the birth
rate is increased education.  Education is of course different than
intelligence, but if the intelligent people are the ones who want to
make sure that they and their offspring get educated, and if
intelligence is carried genetically, then the intelligentsia will
eventually breed themselves out of existence.

There are already about a dozen errata in the que, but I hadn\'t seen one
here. I don\'t have the book with me; I\'ll check when I get home. In the

formula in VE2 is based on $, that in T:FT on MCr. Big difference.

I would however offer as a working definition:   a being is a sophont if it is
aware of itself as a separate being from the universe at large, and is aware
of the knowledge that it possesess.

As to the second, key, clause:  a dog knows and remembers a great deal of
information, but it is not aware that it posseses certain pieces of knowledge
when it is not using it.  It must be "reminded" of everything by some

sorry 3Gs is actual accelleration (thrust 4Gs).  I don\'t have the book
handy but it is 3Gs for a period of time, throttle back to 1.5G? for a
minute(to determine if an abort to Kenedy is needed), then back to 3G

I play using CORPS from BTRC.  When I do play actual Traveller, I tend to
use either MT or T4 with Marc\'s upgrades.

Making it public would only invite retribution.  Even the Soviet Union kept
quiet about it\'s handling of troublesome citizens in the Eastern Bloc
countries.

Also, using regular military personal makes it an act of war.  An agent can
be denied, a serving officer is so much more difficult.

<good natured jibe>
Allow me to pick at nits for a moment, just to show how difficult it is to
define (sophont, sapient, sentient, self-aware, ad nausem)

A great many beings which inhabit Terra circa 2000 A.D., and are considered
to be sentient, consider themselves to be \'one\' with the universe at large.

<a bit more serious>
I think it would be very difficult to define intelligent life in any
objective sense.  (Especially if that definition were to be used to
determine status/rights of a given species.)

I haven\'t found the willy in any of the rules sets yet.  I suspect,
however, that it\'s from CT, as CT design issues are strictly
volume-related, with no real concern for mass.  Stats are highly
variable.  Finally, the appropriate hands doing appropriate waving, (or
other appropriate things) dramatically improve the physics of the

I think the fairest way would be to send a representative of the species to
some council to determine if they are sophonts.  You aren\'t allowed to enslave
that species until it gets certified as non-sophontic.  Once you get that
certification, you can abuse them as you see fit.

I know this is a rhetorical question, but I can\'t help it. Insanity is a
legal term. I don\'t recall the exact definition (Bloo?), but it has to do
with whether or not a person can be held accountable for his own actions in
a court of (U.S.) law.

Certainly that categorization of someone as "insane" is up to subjective
definition. However, many of the behavioral traits that are displayed by
those we currently refer to as mentally ill are not. Defining a condition
as healthy or unhealthy does not change the condition. A person that
suffers from catatonic schizophrenia exhibits the same behavior whether he
or she is considered by society at large as "consulting the gods" or "sick."

The goal of psychology as a science is to develop a way of measuring the
variables that cause such behavior in order to describe, make predictions
about, and understand why it occurs. With this understanding (hopefully)
will come the technology to change it, if we -- the society at large --
decide that it is what we want to do.

TL advances won\'t help us with the ethical questions in any sphere -- but
that doesn\'t mean that the advances won\'t be there.

If you are using the term "intuitive" to mean simply processing information
without having to think it through explicitly, then I agree with you.

<giggle> Why avoid the word "intelligence," since "proper brain structure"
is just a code phrase for the same concept? ;-)

I\'m not so sure about this, unless by "to properly intuit" you mean
"learn." Intuition is learned knowledge that doesn\'t rely on language. For
example, once you learn how to do it, throwing a baseball is intuitive. You
can do it without thinking "I must throw at x velocity and y angle to get z
distance."

It is highly unlikely to be necessary to do higher math in your head just
to get around in a zero-G environment. Many, many mathematically complex
activities are picked up relatively easily by living things. Inability to
function in such an environment would almost certainly be the result of a
physiological shortcoming.

In other words, those that are able to control everyone else determines who
is sapient and who isn\'t.

In other words, might makes right. ;-)

I think that\'s a pretty good description of reality.

GDW\'s Alien SModule 4, Zhodani, page 27, may hold a clue. The acquired
skills tables, has in Prole skills one chance in six of the skill
\'Brawling\'.

IMHO:
This can be used to represent a Martial Arts style filling the social niche
of Ti Chi. If used as a combative stlye I suggest that the stlye will have
been tweeked from the Tavrchedl\' (Thought Police). Omitt lethal strikes,
necessary sweeps or strike point awarness to deal with armoured (esp std
Zho combat armour) opponents. To balence increase the non-lethal strikes
(open handed and circular moves), holds and pinning techniques. Add a
strong philosiphy of \'action in reaction\' and \'deflection of force\', and
accent the stlye towards a sporting approach (like the veriation between
Kendo and Kenjitsu).

If you expand or modify for the Nobles and Armed Forces, not justified by
the incidence in skill tables. Then include lethal strikes, close terrain
or streight strikes and modify the philosiphial imperatives. I\'d be
inclined to keep the sporting use as an approved military recreation.

The waeknesses of such a style are a \'face the opponent only\', prefrence to
try to take\'em alive in the military and inability to deal with armed
(blade or gun) opponents re the incidence of blade and gun cbt in non-prole
careers. The facing problem derives from one on one sporting practice
situations and a biult in bilndsiding to a teleporting opponent from
tweeked from the Tavrchedl\'. The take\'em alive from excitment when they
forget that this isn\'t a sproting situation.

non-IMHO:
I am aware of the opinion that the \'Brawling\' skill adheres to the Soviet
model and represents sport. I\'ve not found a back reference to this, if
anyone can provide one I\'d be most greatful.

Insanity (or diminished capacity) as a defense means that you are incapable of
telling right from wrong.  It\'s also a highly subjective decision on the part
of the jury, and (obviously) isn\'t applied to people who are arguably insane,
but aren\'t criminals.  In other definitions, you can only force
institutionalization of someone (for insanity) if you can show that they are a
danger to themselves or others.

Overall, I\'m not at all convinced that there\'s any overall definition for
\'sane\' or \'insane\' in US law.

Not necessarily, but the context of the conversation necessitates some
kind of provable standard. You think a dog is not a sophant because you
have lived your whole life with dogs and have the background of all your
race\'s accumulated history with dogs to tell you so.

But what about that 10-legged blue thing you just found wandering around
your scoutship? Is it a sophant? Is it aware of all the things it knows
even when it isn\'t using the information?

How can you tell?

This was from a very early Journal (#11? 14?)... can\'t remember the article
name, sorry. It involved a number (how many??) of atmospheric fighters
escorting a country\'s leader who was riding one of six G-Carriers. The
interceptors were two Rampart fighters. The atmospheric fighters each had
one ship missile that they could use on the Ramparts. It was stated that
the Ramparts were immune to everything the fighters had EXCEPT the missile.
Three ranges were used: short, long, and extreme. Only the Ramparts could
escape to extreme range (simply by flying straight up).

The suggestion was to base all ranges off the G-Carriers, since they were
the slowest vehicles and also the primary targets.

The six G-Carriers were just a version of the old shell game - the Ramparts
don\'t know which one the leader is in, so attack them all.

Soooo, what...it\'s so because you say it is? 

You made assertions in your earlier statement that do not seem to hold
up. 

How do you know that dogs, for instance, require outside stimulus to
remember learned knowledge and that humans do not?

Let\'s make it even stickier - It\'s generally accepted in the late
Third Imperium that an AI Robot _cannot_ be a sophont or citizen;
IIRC, the rationale was that it was an artificial creation.  If
this attitude holds in the early Third Imperium, then would it be
possible to _disenfranchise_ some of the minor races that show
marked variation from the Solomani/Vilani/Zhodani norm? (e.g.,
the Geonee, or the geneered humans in Solomani space with the
humongous ears and larynxes who live on a planet where the only
way to handle long distance communication (severe electrical
storms on a near-continuous basis) is to shout from one island to
another)  After all, these races are clearly geneered, and
therefore arguably "artificial constructs".

What about people with prosthetics or bionics?  When do they
become less sophont than robot?

Worse still - working with the "artificial creation" issue, would
it be possible to deny that Norris\'s "true-daughter" is a sophont
or citizen?  What about Avery, who is likely to be a clone of
Strephon (though we don\'t know this for sure)?  Are Strephon\'s
ceremonial doubles clones, biological robots, or people who have
given up their independent lives in exchange for the luxury and
perqs of "being" the Emperor?  If they\'re not hired actors, are
they sophonts and citizens?

(Obviously, I\'ve been reading again.  Equally obviously, HBP made
it easy on the Zarathustrans.)

I really don\'t see why a dog couldn\'t be thinking about going out to play
fetch while he\'s busily devouring his dinner. No stimulous required. He
finishes dinner, goes and gets the stick and takes it to Master...

<wag wag, toss stick at feet> BARK!

Who is to say what a creature is thinking. Now *There* is an interesting
question though...

What role could PSIONICS play in helping us decide who is a sophant and
who is not?

IF you could read a being\'s mind, what would you look for to prove
"sophant" status?

Personally, I prefer the rules in T4/EA which cover the superheated plasma

        Hi, Jim!
        I personally tried the "upgrade" from CT/HG to MT;  I sold me CT/HG
collection to pay for all the shiny new MT books....  the paperwork *killed*
the game.  I was fortunate to have a friend give me his entire and almost
complete CT/HG stuff, and I am very doubtful I will ever use anything but
for Traveller.
        So, that having been said, I don\'t use the "canon" Imperium...  I
run a TL9-11 game set near Earth in the year 2099...  check out my website
if you\'d like more info.  I expect that if I had owned a PC back then, MT
would have been no problem at all and I would have stuck with it.  But with
the binders of paper I required for a moderately detailed 2-group
campaign...  forget it.

While the United States was the first Terran nation to build a starship
capable of jumping interstellar distances, several other groups were in the
process of building starships when the \'Starleaper I\' made it\'s historic
journey to Barnard\'s Star.

So close was the race that, before the Starleaper I returned from it\'s first
mission, the European Space Agency launched it\'s first strship, the
\'Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin\'. The ship jumped to Alpha Centauri, which was
considered less likely to have habitable planets than Barnard\'s Star, but
was somewhat closer to Terra. While the voyage of the Starleaper has become
enshrined in history, in many ways the Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin\'s voyage was
scarcely less important.

The American astronauts returned with news of intelligent life only two
parsecs away. The European crew discovered an eminently habitable world in
the Alpha Centauri system, which they named Prometheus. Plans were quickly
drawn up to claim and colonise the world for Terran humans, even as the
United Nations drifted closer to war with the Vilani.

The Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin is a primitive design, lacking gravitics, fusion
power and other components considered necessary in later vessels. Crew
facilities are cramped and uncomfortable. Nonetheless Several examples of
the Cosmonaut Class Scout/Probe were built from AD 2088 to AD 2098, but 
were
quickly made obselete. The Yuri Gagarin herself was preserved in orbit
around Terra as a heritage piece. There it survived over three thousand
years, before being reduced to slag by the Imperial Navy as it laid seige to
Terra in the final phase of the Solomani Rim War.

An evolutionary development of the Cosmopnaut Class ships entered service
with the fledgeling Terran naval forces in AD 2098. The \'Yarvin Shekerdze\'
class gunships mounted a primitive missile battery, and were among the first
warships fielded by the Terrans as the built their forces prior to the 1st
Interstellar War.

I was 2 when CT came out.  12 when MT came out.  I missed \'em (I started rpgs
w/ AD&D2 when I was... 15 IIRC).  :-)  

I use TNE rules (the "latest/greatest" IMO).   And the TNE Reformation
Coalition setting- think Solomani Confederation, lacking the human supremacism
(though that\'s kinda present with one obscure psuedo-faction) and Party
domination (ugh).
The basic prominent battle is between Centrists and Federalists (big and small
govt, respectively, in a nutshell).

I\'m going to be starting up a 3D Alternate Universe, set relatively new
future,using FF&S and TNE rules set.

Avery is not a clone.  RSB (pg 84) is pretty clear he\'s "the biological son of
Strephon and the dead Empress Iolanthe," conceived in vitro, using ova that
had been removed from Iolanthe in her youth (probably a habit to take "DNA
evidence" from Emperors and ova from the Empresses).

Strephon\'s doubles were clones, as Arrival Vengeance (pg 22) indicates, though
he rarely kept them around because they raised "difficult existential
questions that keep coming back."  He says he could have given them new lives
and let them "become real."  The RSB Library Data indicates that simulacrum
(clones fashioned to duplicate the original; a tradition dating to Paulo I for
heirs to the Iridium Throne to be cloned in infancy for ceremonial doubles)
had a dubious status as sophonts.  Some Emperors created programs to
rehabilitate their doubles and enter society as "real persons" while others
simply ordered them destroyed upon their deaths.  

Psuedobios?  What happened to AB-101 when Strephon discovered Dr Kranstein\'s
(?) construction?  It was discovered, wasn\'t it?  (I only have a couple
Traveller\'s Digests).  I imagine Cleon\'s ruling against robots would hold
against Psuedobios.  *Exhibiting* but not possessing sentience.  Course, I
expect that doubletalk from Cleon.  ;-)

Surgical (human) doubles would definately be sophonts, unless the "real"
Emperor wanted to just make them "disapear" or keep someone from spilling the
beans.  Beyond the waving and smiling, and the obvious opulence they would
live in, I don\'t think these guys who have a whole lot of fun.

Strephon wants his successors to have access to his "spin" on what\'s

Geeze, wouldn\'t you know it.  I think I\'m responsible for the change in the
original book form 0.0048 to 4.8.  I was getting unreasonably small crew
sizes during the playtest because I was inputting ship price in MCr. Using
price in MCr seemed more reasonable because tha6t\'s the way it\'s listed in
ship descriptions.  I guess there\'s no happy medium.

Half of all dolphins do in fact have an appendage which in fact they are
capable of using for slight manipulation.

In Traveller they need the Waldo skill to use the Waldos that are can be
surgically attached and they need a set of the waldos (CR 250,000 IIRC).

However because primates are capable of using tools primates are capable
of thinking of using tools in different ways.  Even if (and that is not
a small if) a cetacean had a high general intelligence their brains are
not as used to considering the possibility of tool use.  Since humans
can use tools they gain evolutionary advantage from using them in clever
ways.  Therefore tool using ability is evolutionarily selected for. 
Since cetaceans can not use tools the ability to use tools well has not
been selected for.

Several people have mentioned that you can detect objects with an apparent
diameter smaller than their sensor resolution.  This is clearly true.
However, using a star- i.e. a massive all-wavelength EMITTER, is a very bad
comparison with a small masked target.  After all, the only part of the
missile that will be seen is the 2m diameter ablative-foam "mushroom" shield
on the tip.  While hardly very sophisticated, a very-low density foam will
be a very, very good EMS shield.  At best, the shield will be a few
fractions of a degree above ambient background radiation.  As for the fusion
plume, which will be VERY visible with any passive sensor array, it is only
on during the initial run in and last couple of seconds.  The use of
compressed gas steering jets should be plenty sufficient for course
corrections.
     A note, when I designed this missile, I assumed it wasn\'t for use
during pitched battles- basically, it was for use during ambushes and raids.
Thus a main premise was the ability to gain high velocities unobserved, then
use the energy generated for a "sneak" attack that is only obvious at the
very last second.  A good example would be to "run it up" from behind, say a
gas giant, and then run cold until almost at the target.  That\'s the reason
for no active sensors.  Basically, passive sensors would be unlikely to
detect it until such close range that reaction was impossible due to the
short time till impact.

As for stopping, once again, the "guidance" is command control, which means
that the control unit can be safely placed in the back, shielded by the bulk
of the missile.  Note:  This is a good reason for escorts.  While,
theoretically, a PDL could simply keep firing until the KKM is vaporized, in
reality, the missile depends first, on coming in undetected, and second,
using its mass to absorb the (relatively) low-powered PDL blasts.

Finally, I never though this would be a torpedo in space- it is simply too
easy for an enemy aware of it to stop it.  OTOH, it certainly is a
channelizing weapon- even a Tigress captain will think twice about getting
hit by one.   I don\'t want to re-start the near-C rock wars, but one method
I thought of was to have a carrier ship boost normal missiles to high
relative velocities for attacks on predicatable targets- frontier refueling,
anyone?

I\'m not sure I\'m the resident expert, but I *do* like FUDGE. ;->

You have to include it in stuff you publish, but here on the
list...frankly, I don\'t know.  We don\'t print Far Future\'s legal
stuff on all our posts, so I guess we don\'t have to post FUDGE\'s
legal stuff on everything either.  I\'m sure you do if you publish
something, or put up a web page.

One thing I like about FUDGE is that there are as many ways to play
it as there are GM\'s...Ok, there are *more* ways than there are
GM\'s. ;->

Actually, I was using the wrong units.  If I use MCr instead of the full

Yep, and my main contention was that attempted control of our diversiity (in
any direction, up, down sideways) reduces our capability for survival, because
it\'s the diversity that\'s our strong point.

Simple, most of them have been made by _in_ the West but by Chinese, Indian,
Russian, etc, researchers.

I have no idea, whether it\'s at all true, but what I do know is that US and
other Western countries are increasingly importing high tech and scientific
personnel from "third world" locations because they can\'t find the skills,
knowledge and ability locally.

A delegation of Silicon Valley CEOs recently went to see Clinton to lobby him
into preventing the imposition of stronger immigration restrictions for exacty
that reason, they claimed the US was unable to produce the sort of highly
skilled and knowledgable people they needed.

This is nothing new as well. Way back in 1979 Jerr Pournelle and Robert
Heinlien were bemoaning the lack of engineerig graduates coming out of US
colleges, and predicting that the US would have to import it\'s engineers in
future. With Jerry and Robert\'s patriotism, they actually tried to prevent
such articles getting to overseas locations back then !

Well, that would assume that they were correct. I\'d say that actually, China
is not an easy place to survive, at least not as easy as the West now, so they
would still be needing intelligence.

That\'s not the problem really, as they are only individuals. It\'s all the
millions of people
who stay alive who would have died if they\'d had to make their own food and
shelter that tips the scales.

Basically, "social responsibility" is anti-darwinian.

Where did you hear this? Raw and generalized intelligence scores have been
increasing ever since IQ tests have been invented, especially in
first-world countries. Theories for this Flynn Effect vary, but it has been
quite well documented.

Some have claimed the exact opposite, that the Flynn effect is caused by
modern technology favoring higher intelligence. However, the rise in
intelligence scores is too rapid to be caused by genetic change. Western
civilization has not existed long enough to account for any significant
change in human genetics.

The Ramparts hull is not made of titanium, it is made of bonded
superdense.

What is the melting point of superdense & of bonded superdense anyone?

Hard Times has a bit where they use an arcwelder on a starship hull,
although we do not learn what type of material that hull is made of
still this may provide a slight clue.

We know how strong & dense superdense is, do we know what its melting
point is?  Is it magnetic?  What color or colors is it?  How does it
wear?  How malleable is it?  What is its heat conductivity?  How about
its coefficient of friction [a phrase that is, alas, not as dirty as it
sounds].

Do we know anything else about it either?  Superdense what?  What metals
(or other substances?) do you start with before doing what to them to
get superdense? 

FF&S2 says (pg 63) Superdense "A material whose molecular structure has
been partially collapsed by intense artificial gravity felds, increasing
both density & strength".

Maybe. Two problems:

1. Easy to model in a hex-map combat system. Let missile boost fer a
turn, then only use gs to make contact on turn of "kill." If they
are the same, or consecutive turns, you get no benefits for being
"quiet." (BTW, your course might move on the order of a missile
diameter or two with jets, but not more than that--gas jets would
never work for course corrections on the order of multi-g
maneuvering targets.)

2.  the last seconds to contact are also within the range where
lasers can\'t possibly miss. So if target is evading, and shooting,
missile misses. Target only shoots and it might get hit. Target only
evades, it might get hit.

In this mode a useful weapon, IMO. Model it in a combat system as I
suggest above. Dunno about what kind of mod it might get.

But it still has sensors, right? A stand off mother ship will have
massive light-lag problems.

I really like space torpedos :-) A use for fighters. Fighters boost
missiles and drop them on intercept vector. Fighters drive away, hot
engines aglow. Targets see, fighters, see them turn to some nnew
heading, but don\'t see missiles since they are in a standby mode til
they get close enough to lock and hit targets.

the torpedo could beam back its sensor data, and the distant command
control could simply be to release the weapon to attack. the
operator on the fighter or ship then watches his display... hit
chances are flashing for each weapon he controls. He can wait and
maybe miss a target (lag is a problem for him), or release them too
soon and have them get shot down when they expose themselves by
thrusting (becoming instantly visible). Kinda neat.

Well, according to the OED, 

sapience: correct taste or judgement

Therefore, anyone who disagrees with me or has poor taste, is clearly not
sapient.  Easy.... :)

It might be fair but it\'s hardly practical.

A simpler solution would be to read the IISS report for the planet.

If the scout who wrote it says they are sophonts, then they are
sophonts, otherwise they aren\'t.

Obviously, there would be an appeals procedure - the species can lodge
an appeal at the subsector capital. If approved, it would be passed
on to the sector duke, then referred up to the domain archduke.

If not rejected it would go before the Moot and they could decide
if it was fit to be put before the emperor who would then decree
once and for all time their status.

Presumably, this procedure could also be used in reverse.

If they don\'t appeal, they aren\'t sophonts.

"I don\'t know, the plans are at the subsector capital only 7 parsecs
 away. If you can\'t even be bothered to take an interest in local
 politics, I don\'t see why I should have any sympathy for you."

Better yet, from the perspective of the IISS:

From the perspective of the Imperium:

I know there will be lots of borderline cases, but I\'ll bet the "average"

I prefer the MT system with my own background.  I\'m also working on 
rules for Traveller HERO, but since I\'ve succeeded in convincing my 
die-hard HERO players to give MT a try, I can spend more time in a 
system I\'m comfortable with.  Loved CT, although MT works better for 
me.  TNE rules turned me off, and it\'s taken a while to get over the 
Virus slam on the OTU, but I\'m getting better.  I just got a copy of 
T4 from Half-Priced Books day before yesterday, and am now 
reevaluating my position on that, so the jury\'s still out. Looking 
forward to T5, though.

This is going to be such a shock to my girlfriend.  :)

No, seriously, the more emphasis I place on one or two of these, the 
more the remainder suffer.  Still seeking the correct balance, but at 
least I get to roll dice twice a week, while my SO watches TV or 
sews.  (She\'s happy, I\'m happy, my gamers are happy.  Work complains

Okay, I checked and the formula in the book (p. 75) is correct. It is also
pretty aggressively labeled "price in MCr" in the appropriate places, so I
guess that isn\'t the problem. Were you perhaps taking the result, which is
in man-hours per day, and using it for a total maintenance crew requirement
instead? I can see where that could happen.

For what it\'s worth, I checked all the sample ships in the appendix (pp.
136-140) against the maintenance requirement. I only had to add one or two
extra crewmembers (over what pp. GT149-150 requires) to one design to meet
it, although I did have to tweak just who I counted as "maintenance
personnel" depending on the ship.

There\'s more to it than that.

The need for technological skills is endless - no matter how many people
your country could provide right now, you could always use more. The
USA has such a standard of living compared to other countries that people
come here. Would you stay home and work for laborer\'s wages if you
could come here and get a middle-class or higher standard of living?

Third-world students come to the US to learn high-tech skills because
the US has a reputation for teaching first-rate engineers and scientists.
These students are usually meant (by whomever paid their way) to come
back to their homeland and contribute those skills to improve the
standard of living where they came from. Many do go home, many
notice that they can make hundreds of thousands of dollars and live
in a first-world country if they stay in the US. If they go home, they\'ll
make a few tens of thousands of dollars - if they aren\'t killed in a civil
uprising or jailed as an enemy of the state. 

If I\'m an American engineering student and flunk out, I can probably
end up with a moderately comfortable lower-middle-class job in
a safe area with good food and reasonable education for my kids. Compare
that to what awaits a third-world foriegn exchange student - not if he
flunks out, but if he doesn\'t excel well enough to get research fellowships,
good job offers, or positions with American universities.

I\'ve worked four years at universities. The desperation I\'ve seen from some
foreign exchange students, and even visiting foriegn professors, makes me 
want to watch my back. That\'s one way to instill a work ethic.

Furthermore, the US has labs and science facilities that are legendary
to the rest of the world. The top-flight scientists of other countries come
here because the facilities are often tech levels above what their home
countries can make available to them.

Walt Smith

ObTrav: Can any low-tech Imperial world prevent a brain drain? All the
smart, motivated people find a way to get off-world employment and
high-tech education (Scouts, Army, Marines, etc.), those who stay
behind can\'t compete with the off-world corporate interests who want
to exploit local resources. A low-tech world might get to a point where
every doctor, techie and administrator has more in common with
off-worlders than they do with the locals. More division between the
Traveller Elite and the Unwashed Masses.

Ah Bullsh*t...this is all neo-Darwinian claptrap. The _reason_ that there are
so many foreign graduate students in the US is that the US graduate schools
are considered superior.

Again, bullsh*t! They are doing so because foreign labor is _cheaper_ pure and
simple. A foreign employee automatically has the hammer of the INS over them
to keep \'em in line.

All of those Silicon Valley execs pissing and moaning about how they have a
talent shortage is just posturing. 

They have a _cheap, young_ talent shortage. 

Silicon Valley, in many ways, is worse than Hollywood...if you\'re over 30,
you\'re washed up, though in this case it\'s not because you might look old, but
because you no longer have the desire to work 80-90 hour weeks for $40k plus
stock options in a company that has never made a dime. You want to be treated
like a human, and have a life of your own. If you\'re 40 and not an executive
in your own company and a paper millionare? Fuggedaboutit! go way, we don\'t
want you! Doncha\' know, anyone over 35 is worthless can\'t learn a thing, don\'t
know the hot paradigm of the moment.

RANT/

What we seem to be having is a hard time distinguishing reality from cynical
partisan propaganda. Did you know, in fact, that US student test scores have
been steadily increasing, and were not really all that low, that the crime
rate has dropped precipitously and that the majority of computer and systems
engineers in the US are Americans?

Of course not, that isn\'t news! What\'s news is anecdotes about a high-schooler
who graduated unable to read, or can\'t find Africa on a map or random horrific
crimes happening to someone, or there are no competent programmers left in
America. Yes, Jerry Springer presents an accurate portrayal of average
Americans, and all our city streets are JUST like what you see on COPS! We\'re
getting dumber, because our TeeVee says so!!!

What bothers me about these neo-social-darwinists is that they themselves are
%$@#!@# clueless about biology, and have the attention span of the average
baby-boomer. Their lifespans are all that counts and everything important in
the universe has happened since 1947.

We have had time for _two_ generations in that time span. This isn\'t enough
time to vaguely select for _anything_ in the population, much less making us
so significantly dumber that the only important breakthoughs in our society
are due to them furriners in our midst...

/RANT

Of course more American kids go into fields other than engineering or the
sciences...but our popular culture has never held those careers in much
esteem. Nerds have NEVER been popular on campus. Not now, not in the 70\'s, the
60\'s or the 50\'s. Look who drove the great breakthroughs in physics and
chemistry in the 30\'s in American universities. For that matter not in the
1850\'s. There is a strong anti-intellectual streak that has run throughout
American culture from the beginning. It has waxed and waned but it has always
been there.

But we\'re only getting dumber NOW???

Walt Smith made some excellent points on this, but I feel compelled to
chime in here. As a card-carrying member of the IEEE this has been a
pretty hot topic of debate in the IEEE Spectrum (the monthly pan-IEEE
magazine).

To set the stage: The IEEE is a worldwide organization for sharing
knowledge amongst electrical & electronic engineers (IEEE == Institute
for Electrical & Electronic Engineers). There are national branches,
which do things like lobbying governments on behalf of the membership
(IEEE:USA, IEEE:Canada, etc).

The IEEE:USA has been lobbying Congress (et al) to keep the number of
H-1 visas (temporary foreign worker visas, usually given to high-tech
workers) capped. Last year, all the H-1 visas (I may have the identifier
wrong) ran out around August I think... essentially, a lot of skilled
people couldn\'t get into the US from August to December. This was pretty
upsetting to a lot of big companies, who have been lobbying for an
increase in the numebr of H-1s.

Now, it is true that the US (and Canada to a lesser degree) benefits
greatly from the influx of highly intelligent and skilled immigrants
from other countries who come looking for better educational &
employment prospects. HOWEVER: the nature of high-tech employment has
changed pretty drastically over the last decade or two. Look at any
high-tech job ad and you\'ll see a description that can only be perfectly
fitted to about a few dozen people WORLDWIDE. In the cutthroat world of
American Business(tm), it\'s cheaper to hire someone who can match the
needed skills without training than finding someone who\'s smart and a
close match and training them. Thus, with the US\'s fairly liberal
immigration policies, it\'s often cheaper to bring someone in to do work
(who has the right skill set) than to retrain someone who you may
already have on staff, or at least close at hand.

I am not anti-immigration, but I do think that relying on a constant
influx of skilled immigrants is less desirable than making some
investments in training and trying to fill personell needs from a local
staffing pool. For example: Ontario is no longer producing enough
doctors to meet its own needs. What happens if doctors stop wanting to
immigrate here? Do I just stop getting medical care?

Anyway, enough off-topic rambling. I don\'t think anyone is getting "less
smart" (i.e. dumber). I do think that with an increasingly global base
from which companies can select employees, a lot of people who think
getting a good job is "easy" are finding that there\'s a hell of a lot
more competition than the people in your town.

ObTrav: Anyone think there\'s a planet that\'s the Imperial equivalent of
Ireland? Sending generation after generation of their best and brightest
off-world because of problems at home? This would, of course, mjean that
there would be some sort of equivalent to Guiness...

And if the fighter is designed at the same tech level so will the fighter.
If fact the fighter will be able to manuver better.  Your happy fun ball has
to use 1 G just to say in the air.  It has to use more of it\'s Gs to slow
down and turn.  The fighter can use it\'s wings to turn and manuver while
running it\'s engines at full output.

No, I have not.  I have also not forgot those systems take up space and

The rampart does not have contragrav in it\'s design.

No contragrav on the rampart so to hover it has to be tail down.  If it
rotated to bring it noe on with a level target it would stall an tumble.
With thos small wings it would have to fall a ways before it\'s wing load
would let it pull out of the dive.  Durring that dive the thruster could
only be used to speed up the dive.

NO!  I\'m saying that the space ship moves worse in an atmosphere.  How can
you say that with all other things being equal that a plane designed for max
performance in the atmosphere and one designed design for both space and
atmospheric flight will be equal in the atmosphere?  If they are or if the
space fighter is better the areo fighter designer was a moron!

First the aero fighter can carry laser just as well as the space fighter.
Something you seem to neglect.  The aero fighter can have better aerodynamic
for combat flight because it does not have to deal with reentry.  The space
fighter will have to carry it\'s weapons load internally for reentry.  The
aero firghter can use pylon mounts as well as internal mounts.  The space
fighter has to carry heat shielding, life support, radiation shielding and a
host of other thing that it has to have to operate in space that the aero
fighter just does not need.  The weight penalty alone for the duel mode of
operation will be enogh to tip the scales in the aero fighters favor.

Also, the space fighter pilot is not likely to be as good at atmospherice
combat as the aero fighter.

Also the aero fighter can be designed for greater in atmosphere speed than
the space fighter.  High speed in the atmosphere requires special design of
the buffeting and turbulence will tear the craft apart.

>Anyway, a sane person would either (a) kill the F22 at range from space or

And the F22 would shoot back at the space enemy.  It has space capable
weapons or the designer is an idiot.

While we are at at this lets look at some ome the other support the
aerofighter can expect.  How about a Iowa class battle ship with it\'s 16\'
guns replaces with type T mason guns, it\'s 5\' guns replaced with type d
mason guns, and all it AAs replaces with heavy rapid fire lasers.  Say there
are six of these per ocean.  A tigress inters high orbit and get hit by 54
Type Ts and 150 type Ds.  Let add an equal number of arsonel ships and we
can add 600,000 tons of missle bays at a minimum.

As another point, if the rampart is the \'best\' design then the planet will
be using them of a knock off AND will have a lot more of them that any space
force can bring with them.  A planet is one huge space station after all.

Actually I ment an eqaul tech level fighter as I said.  A 5 tech level

So, what does that matter if it\'s weapon are a 360 degree threat.

The rampart does NOT have CG.  Look at the design in AHL.

Of course not, but the fight will be in the atmosphere.

Nope, see above.  Also even if the rampart has CG so could at eqaul tech
level fighter but I dought it would.  The weight penalty would not be wouth
it.  A larger plane carrying armor and a heavy war load would be more cost
effective.  The plane would launch enough small fast missles to overload the
rampart one laser in the one round it would take for them to close with the
target.  On hit in the atmosphere and it\'s over.

I\'ll have a laser also, many several.  I can afford to with all that weight

That was what I was discussing, sorry.  I reread the post but as I

things being equal.  I have said this several times.

And nearly useless.  Space and atmosphere are two very different
enviroments.  In space you get 1000k temperture changes from light to dark.
In the atmosphere you have wind shear that can pancake a 747.  A sea gull
will total an SR71.  Think about a 3 pound object moving at a relative
velocity greater than a rifle bullet.  One small hole in the ships skin lets
in winds with the power of a tornado.

The aircraft has an active set also.  And is the space set designed to deal
with the goasting caused by an atmosphere?  Is it designed to withstand the
buffeting of fast trastit through an atmosphere.  What about refected power?
Harmonic distotion?  Intermod?  Electrical storms?  And just how is a 40
foot in diameter space sensor dish going to survive 300+ mile per hour
winds?  And what is the wind load going to do to your manuverability?  Have
a looked at the physical size of workable space sensors in Bruces sensor
rules?  I seriosly dout that the space fighter will be able to use the same
set in the atmosphere he used in space.  The IR system will be nearly
usless.  Lidar will go with visibility.  That leaves you with radar the same
as the aero fighter.  And he is trained to use his IN the atmosphere, and
his is design to work IN his atmosphere.

That was never my argument.  My basic premise was that a TL15 space craft
would be no match for a TL15 air craft in the atmosphere.  I think that the
first poster had the other premise.  The TL15 space crafts laser would
decide the battle with the TL8 fighter plane provided it has the sensors to
use it in the atmosphere.  If the fighter get off his heat seakers the space
ship is toast.  Under CT combat rules an F15 carries more than enough
missles to overload the fighter laser capacity for the less than one turn it
would take them to arrive. 
 The fighter could fire from over the horizon or behind a clould bank and be
safe from the space ships laser.  Their radar would not be bothered but most
space based sensors could not see through the clouds.  Given the lack
integration shown in the imperial navy they could have a bad time of it
against todays US military.  Almost any of todays units can act as a pointer
for nearly any of our weapon systems.  A infantry man can target for 16\'
navy guns, 200mm morters, tomahawks, bombs, howlitzers, tanks, and missles
with the same hand held device.  He can also call in self guided and seaking
weapons.  I find it a little hard to believe the far furture weapons systems
are as pourly integrated as they as portray to be in traveller.

>BTW I believe a TL15 airsuperiority fighter is more likely to be a sphere

I dought it.  Drag would kill your speed.  No matter how many Gs you have
you still have to deal with terminal velosity and wind effects.  A sphere
has a terminal velosity around 200-280 mph at one G.  That is the point when
air resistance cancel out acceleration.  The effect is non linear and goes
through some wierd permutations arround the speed of sound.  At those speeds
you are talking some serious design limitations.  One small mistake in your
surface geometry and the wind tears your ship apart.

Keep in mind that there is a *big* difference between
a "martial art" and "unarmed combat". A martial art is
limited to certain moves and techniques when used against
an opponent. Practice of a martial art is for perfection
of form.

An unarmed combat methodology is studied to optimize the
use of the human body\'s assets in order to cripple or
kill, as fast as possible, an enemy who wants to kill you.

Martial arts are derived from unarmed combat but is often
confused with it (thanks to Hollywood). If you make a mistake
with a martial art, you\'ll likely wind up with a bruise.
You mess up with unarmed combat, odds are you\'re dead.

Also, keep in mind the Vilani armed forces have for centuries
waged "no holds barred" combat. They are trained to view
an opponent as "the Enemy" who deserves no mercy. This has
been documented in "Vilani and Vargr", I believe. Given
this predilection, any opponent who uses a martial art
rather than unarmed combat against Vilani troops will more
than likely lose.

I\'d say the Zho armed forces would be just as merciless as
the Vilani and any open-hand techniques would be just as
deadly. Would they have various martial arts disciplines
for civilians? I\'m not sure; after all, such a controlled
and "well-adjusted" society would be very unlikely to allow
or need the development of such practices.

People keep saying this, but it\'s not true. A black foam shield at 1 AU
will rapidly heat up to room temperature from sunlight, easily
detectable by thermal infrared against space. If it\'s a white
shield, it won\'t heat up as much but you\'ll see it by reflected sunlight.
SO you need a black shield and you need to cool it actively,  which means
you need refrigeration, which needs power, which means you need a place
to radiate away waste heat...

Compressed-gas steering jets will only suffice if the target isn\'t maneuvering-
no compressed-gas jet can match the delta-V of a Traveller starship. (Jets
are for a few tens of meters per second.)

Not a bad concept, but don\'t put a fusion rocket on it; fusion rockets are
visible across the entire solar system. And once the fusion rocket goes off
its course becomes predictable - cold jets can\'t change it enough that
you can\'t keep tracking where its going to be until it comes into LIDAR
range. If you want to surprise someone,
use T-plates. (Expensive and more limited.)

Such weapons do have roles. As you say, in surprise or against targets with
limited maneuverability. IMTU such weapons are refered to as "Kinetic Lances"
and they occupy a role similar to fireships in the Napoleonic Wars - feared,
but really only useful against targets in harbour or otherwise stationary,
and generally scorned by most combatents.

>\'sane\' or \'insane\' in US law.

Insanity is not a term widely used (in my experience) by psychologists,
except when talking about legal issues. The definitions vary from state to
state (although I think there has been a version in Federal law since 1984).

Here is an excerpt from Arizona law (since this is the only reference I
have immediately available):

13-502: Insanity test; burden of proof; guilty except insane verdict

A. A person may be found guilty except insane if at the time of the
commission of the criminal act the person was afflicted with a mental
disease or defect of such severity that the person did not know the
criminal act was wrong. [...] Mental disease or defect does not include
disorders that result from acute voluntary intoxication or withdrawal from
alcohol or drugs, character defects, psychosexual disorders or impulse
control disorders. Conditions that do not constitute legal insanity include
but are not limited to momentary, temporary conditions arising from the
pressure of the circumstances, moral decadence, depravity or passion
growing out of anger, jealousy, revenge, hatred or other motives in a
person who does not suffer from a mental disease or defect or an
abnormality that is manifested only by criminal conduct. [...]

The full citation can be found at:

http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/502.htm

A very interesting article on the effects of such laws in general can be
found at:

http://www.law.vill.edu/vls/law-review/Volume_39/lafond1.htm

The section titled "Common Misperceptions About The Insanity Defense" is
especially enlightening.

ObTrav: Would there be a definition insanity in Imperial Law? Given the
possibility of quick high-tech treatments (as opposed to long
institutionalization) would the public-at-large stand for such laws?

That\'s actually pretty close to the situation in reality. One of the
reasons that ships just keep getting bigger (absent artificial
restrictions, like having to fit through the Panama Canal), is that crew
sizes -- and therefore life support and salaries -- increase much more
slowly than hull sizes. The smallest ocean-going tramp freighters have
around 30 crew; the largest tankers afloat only maybe 200.

Naval vessels are a completely different matter, of course.

Could it be a kind of allotropic iron?  (The same as diamonds
and bucky balls are allotropic forms of carbon.)

Intense gravitic compression would force the material to bind

    'body' => 'Greetings All:

I don\'t have SJG\'s merchant book yet, but in my (slowly reviving) campaign,
I\'m leaning towards running the group as merchants.

I\'ve come up with a few thoughts that I\'d like to briefly run by you all:

(1) Trader\'s Guild: Sort of like the "Ace Hardware" answer to Home
Depot/Lowe\'s. Small merchants band together in order to compete effectively
vs. the Big Boys. I\'m not sure how far to push the "bennies", but the thought
was to a clearinghouse for trades/cargo, maybe selling bids on new prospects,
some sort of insurance/health insurance, etc.

(2) Big boy/small boy relationship: A larger firm hires an independent firm
(one or more ships) to help cover smaller routes. Gives them a guarantee on
business for that route. Sort of like the "mail run" relationship that the
Imperium has with some free traders.

And here\'s one more (less developed):

(3) Would the Imperium (at any level, down to subsector) hire traders to act
as information gathering platforms (not spies, more like news clippers). This
came to me from my thoughts about James Blish\'s "Cities in Flight" series in
which the "Okies" (flying cities) acted as bumblebees for the galactic
civilization: moving technology and ideas around the galaxy, cross-pollinating
cultures, leading to new technology and ideas.

I\'d like to model my free traders after those found in Andre Norton\'s stories
(both the stories about the Solar Queen as well as others). Anybody have any
thoughts on that (that is where I started to come up with the Trader\'s Guild
stuff). I\'m also wondering about the Thieve\'s Guild (although I would hate to
inflame the pirates discussion again!).

Actually, according to Mr Wiseman, it bolted to the wall.  I am in the

  As Striker (I) is of course the expanded CT combat module, it might be
pointed out that a properly designed TL F gunship would include at least
one PD fire-con, arguably capable of editing 4-16 _dice_ of projectiles
each turn; attached to a laser it will also ignore the targets speed and
air combat agility (IIRC) modifiers. TZZAP!

  Oh, and said gunship will likely be armoured like a grav tank.

Hell, just dump it during a run to the jump point. The velocities most
ships hit during that run are *way* in excess of system escape
velocity, and the odds of the body passing close to anything that can
intercept it without *lots* of hassles are essentially nil. 

At a measly 100 km/sec it\'ll pass the 40 AU mark in under two years.
And once it\'s out that far it\'s effectively "lost forever".

Guilty.  I probably would have thought of this AFTER setting out with a few
friends and a pickup truck, and tried to work out a deal on the fly by cell
phone.  Many of my more memorable (and less reputable) adventures, both

NASA\'S GALILEO FINDS \'BOTTLE BLONDE\' CHEMICAL ON EUROPA

     Hydrogen peroxide -- the chemical that can turn a brunette into
an instant blonde -- appears on the icy surface of Jupiter\'s moon
Europa,
according to a new discovery by NASA\'s Galileo spacecraft reported
in the March 26 edition of the journal Science. 

     "Hydrogen peroxide is a really weird chemical that reacts strongly
with almost everything," said Dr. Robert Carlson, principal investigator
for Galileo\'s near-infrared mapping spectrometer instrument, the device
that detected the chemical on Europa. Hydrogen peroxide is formed 
constantly on Europa as Jupiter\'s energetic particles smash apart 
molecules on the surface to produce new chemicals, Carlson said.  This 
process is called radiolysis.

     "We expect to find more bizarre materials on Europa, because it\'s 
constantly bombarded by Jupiter\'s intense particle radiation
environment,"
Carlson said.

     Hydrogen peroxide does not appear naturally on Earth\'s surface,
partly because the surface is not hit by enough radiation to initiate 
the process that creates the chemical.  "On Earth, if we want hydrogen
peroxide, we have to make it in factories," Carlson said. 

     "Almost as soon as hydrogen peroxide is formed, it starts breaking 
down," Carlson explained.  "It\'s either destroyed by ultraviolet light
or changed by contact with other chemicals, so its life span on Europa
is only a few weeks to months."  The hydrogen peroxide becomes another
reactive chemical called hydroxyl, and can ultimately produce oxygen
and hydrogen gas, said Carlson.

     Because Europa\'s surface chemicals are constantly being made 
and destroyed, it\'s hard to study its long-term chemical history, 
Carlson said. "On the other hand, we are interested in watching 
changes in chemical composition over short periods of time.  By 
studying chemical processes on Europa and the other moons of 
Jupiter, we can learn more about how those moons interact with 
Jupiter, and how similar processes occur elsewhere in our solar 
system."

     Galileo\'s near-infrared mapping spectrometer works like a 
prism, breaking up infrared light that is not visible to the 
naked eye.  Since different chemical molecules absorb infrared 
light differently, scientists can study the light patterns and 
determine what chemicals are present. In this case, the 
instrument was used to study infrared light from Europa\'s 
surface, and it detected dark areas of hydrogen peroxide.  The 
human eye would not normally see the hydrogen peroxide on Europa, 
because it is dissolved in surface ice and has no color.

     Galileo\'s instruments had previously detected several other 
chemicals on Europa\'s surface, including sulfur dioxide, water 
ice, carbon dioxide, and possibly salt molecules containing 
water.  Carlson and other scientists will have another chance to 
study the chemistry of Europa\'s surface when the Galileo 
spacecraft flies by Europa on November 25. 

     Galileo has been studying Jupiter, its moons and its magnetic
environment for more than three years. Its primary mission ended
in December 1997, but the spacecraft is in the midst of a two-year
extension called Galileo Europa Mission. 

     The Galileo mission is managed by JPL for NASA\'s Office of 
Space Science, Washington, DC.  JPL is a division of the 
California Institute of Technology. 

     Additional information about the Galileo mission is available 
at: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo.

Converting the gamer into my SO took me more than 8 YEARS! so do not count
on it.  (We were both involved with other people when we first met.  We were
good friends and gaming companions for a long time before we were both free
and saw to posibilities.)

The competition for the very rare single female gamer is fierce!

If your SO is open minded and the other players in the game put forth some
effort to welcome your SO you should not have to many problems...accept
having to share your game books. (Grin)

Once you see that sort of fusion plume, something will go active - probably
not the main ship, but at least something will head towards it emitting.

This may be one of the few good uses for fighters.

The point has also been made about the fusion drive inevitably heating up
the rest of the missile, presenting you with a bunch of IR to get rid of.

I can happily assume side radiators though, which will bleed this off at
the normal ?2000 K? of FFS2 radiators, in a direction well away from the
target.

Not if the target starts maneuvering at 2 gees.

Design a missile and do some numbers under Bruce\'s Definitive Sensor Rules.
See how fast it goes, what it costs, and what the signature is.

One thing I think you will find is you can be stealthy or cheap, but not both.

I dont know about anyone else, but a Famile Spofulam \'Signature\' class
point defense laser is 250 megajoules. And thats the low-powered civilian
version.

\'Dash\' kinetic-kill missiles also have their uses in a counter-missile
role, as do nuke missiles.

Command control from long distances will also give you light-lag issues to
the tune of (target->guidance unit)^2. This will make terminal guidance
difficult, unless you want to be in weapons range of the target.

Sounds like an excellent reason not to do frontier refuelling without a
high guard with active sensors on.

Ah Bullsh*t...this is all neo-Darwinian claptrap. The _reason_ that there
are
so many foreign graduate students in the US is that the US graduate schools
are considered superior.

Again, bullsh*t! They are doing so because foreign labor is _cheaper_ pure
and
simple. A foreign employee automatically has the hammer of the INS over them
to keep \'em in line.

All of those Silicon Valley execs pissing and moaning about how they have a
talent shortage is just posturing.

They have a _cheap, young_ talent shortage.

Silicon Valley, in many ways, is worse than Hollywood...if you\'re over 30,
you\'re washed up, though in this case it\'s not because you might look old,
but
because you no longer have the desire to work 80-90 hour weeks for $40k plus

What we seem to be having is a hard time distinguishing reality from cynical
partisan propaganda. Did you know, in fact, that US student test scores have
been steadily increasing, and were not really all that low, that the crime
rate has dropped precipitously and that the majority of computer and systems
engineers in the US are Americans?

Of course not, that isn\'t news! What\'s news is anecdotes about a
high-schooler
who graduated unable to read, or can\'t find Africa on a map or random
horrific
crimes happening to someone, or there are no competent programmers left in
America. Yes, Jerry Springer presents an accurate portrayal of average
Americans, and all our city streets are JUST like what you see on COPS!
We\'re
getting dumber, because our TeeVee says so!!!

What bothers me about these neo-social-darwinists is that they themselves
are
%$@#!@# clueless about biology, and have the attention span of the average
baby-boomer. Their lifespans are all that counts and everything important in
the universe has happened since 1947.

We have had time for _two_ generations in that time span. This isn\'t enough
time to vaguely select for _anything_ in the population, much less making us
so significantly dumber that the only important breakthoughs in our society
are due to them furriners in our midst...

/RANT

Of course more American kids go into fields other than engineering or the
sciences...but our popular culture has never held those careers in much
esteem. Nerds have NEVER been popular on campus. Not now, not in the 70\'s,
the
60\'s or the 50\'s. Look who drove the great breakthroughs in physics and
chemistry in the 30\'s in American universities. For that matter not in the
1850\'s. There is a strong anti-intellectual streak that has run throughout
American culture from the beginning. It has waxed and waned but it has
always

Walt Smith made some excellent points on this, but I feel compelled to
chime in here. As a card-carrying member of the IEEE this has been a
pretty hot topic of debate in the IEEE Spectrum (the monthly pan-IEEE
magazine).

To set the stage: The IEEE is a worldwide organization for sharing
knowledge amongst electrical & electronic engineers (IEEE == Institute
for Electrical & Electronic Engineers). There are national branches,
which do things like lobbying governments on behalf of the membership
(IEEE:USA, IEEE:Canada, etc).

The IEEE:USA has been lobbying Congress (et al) to keep the number of
H-1 visas (temporary foreign worker visas, usually given to high-tech
workers) capped. Last year, all the H-1 visas (I may have the identifier
wrong) ran out around August I think... essentially, a lot of skilled
people couldn\'t get into the US from August to December. This was pretty
upsetting to a lot of big companies, who have been lobbying for an
increase in the numebr of H-1s.

Now, it is true that the US (and Canada to a lesser degree) benefits
greatly from the influx of highly intelligent and skilled immigrants
from other countries who come looking for better educational &
employment prospects. HOWEVER: the nature of high-tech employment has
changed pretty drastically over the last decade or two. Look at any
high-tech job ad and you\'ll see a description that can only be perfectly
fitted to about a few dozen people WORLDWIDE. In the cutthroat world of
American Business(tm), it\'s cheaper to hire someone who can match the
needed skills without training than finding someone who\'s smart and a
close match and training them. Thus, with the US\'s fairly liberal
immigration policies, it\'s often cheaper to bring someone in to do work
(who has the right skill set) than to retrain someone who you may
already have on staff, or at least close at hand.

I am not anti-immigration, but I do think that relying on a constant
influx of skilled immigrants is less desirable than making some
investments in training and trying to fill personell needs from a local
staffing pool. For example: Ontario is no longer producing enough
doctors to meet its own needs. What happens if doctors stop wanting to
immigrate here? Do I just stop getting medical care?

Anyway, enough off-topic rambling. I don\'t think anyone is getting "less
smart" (i.e. dumber). I do think that with an increasingly global base
from which companies can select employees, a lot of people who think
getting a good job is "easy" are finding that there\'s a hell of a lot
more competition than the people in your town.

ObTrav: Anyone think there\'s a planet that\'s the Imperial equivalent of
Ireland? Sending generation after generation of their best and brightest
off-world because of problems at home? This would, of course, mjean that
there would be some sort of equivalent to Guiness...

And if the fighter is designed at the same tech level so will the fighter.
If fact the fighter will be able to manuver better.  Your happy fun ball has
to use 1 G just to say in the air.  It has to use more of it\'s Gs to slow
down and turn.  The fighter can use it\'s wings to turn and manuver while

No contragrav on the rampart so to hover it has to be tail down.  If it
rotated to bring it noe on with a level target it would stall an tumble.
With thos small wings it would have to fall a ways before it\'s wing load
would let it pull out of the dive.  Durring that dive the thruster could
only be used to speed up the dive.

NO!  I\'m saying that the space ship moves worse in an atmosphere.  How can
you say that with all other things being equal that a plane designed for max
performance in the atmosphere and one designed design for both space and
atmospheric flight will be equal in the atmosphere?  If they are or if the
space fighter is better the areo fighter designer was a moron!

First the aero fighter can carry laser just as well as the space fighter.
Something you seem to neglect.  The aero fighter can have better aerodynamic
for combat flight because it does not have to deal with reentry.  The space
fighter will have to carry it\'s weapons load internally for reentry.  The
aero firghter can use pylon mounts as well as internal mounts.  The space
fighter has to carry heat shielding, life support, radiation shielding and a
host of other thing that it has to have to operate in space that the aero
fighter just does not need.  The weight penalty alone for the duel mode of
operation will be enogh to tip the scales in the aero fighters favor.

Also, the space fighter pilot is not likely to be as good at atmospherice
combat as the aero fighter.

Also the aero fighter can be designed for greater in atmosphere speed than
the space fighter.  High speed in the atmosphere requires special design of
the buffeting and turbulence will tear the craft apart.

>Anyway, a sane person would either (a) kill the F22 at range from space or
>(b) send a Trepida to do the work.
>

And the F22 would shoot back at the space enemy.  It has space capable
weapons or the designer is an idiot.

While we are at at this lets look at some ome the other support the
aerofighter can expect.  How about a Iowa class battle ship with it\'s 16\'
guns replaces with type T mason guns, it\'s 5\' guns replaced with type d
mason guns, and all it AAs replaces with heavy rapid fire lasers.  Say there
are six of these per ocean.  A tigress inters high orbit and get hit by 54
Type Ts and 150 type Ds.  Let add an equal number of arsonel ships and we
can add 600,000 tons of missle bays at a minimum.

As another point, if the rampart is the \'best\' design then the planet will
be using them of a knock off AND will have a lot more of them that any space
force can bring with them.  A planet is one huge space station after all.

Nope, see above.  Also even if the rampart has CG so could at eqaul tech
level fighter but I dought it would.  The weight penalty would not be wouth
it.  A larger plane carrying armor and a heavy war load would be more cost
effective.  The plane would launch enough small fast missles to overload the
rampart one laser in the one round it would take for them to close with the
target.  On hit in the atmosphere and it\'s over.

And nearly useless.  Space and atmosphere are two very different
enviroments.  In space you get 1000k temperture changes from light to dark.
In the atmosphere you have wind shear that can pancake a 747.  A sea gull
will total an SR71.  Think about a 3 pound object moving at a relative
velocity greater than a rifle bullet.  One small hole in the ships skin lets
in winds with the power of a tornado.

The aircraft has an active set also.  And is the space set designed to deal
with the goasting caused by an atmosphere?  Is it designed to withstand the
buffeting of fast trastit through an atmosphere.  What about refected power?
Harmonic distotion?  Intermod?  Electrical storms?  And just how is a 40
foot in diameter space sensor dish going to survive 300+ mile per hour
winds?  And what is the wind load going to do to your manuverability?  Have
a looked at the physical size of workable space sensors in Bruces sensor
rules?  I seriosly dout that the space fighter will be able to use the same
set in the atmosphere he used in space.  The IR system will be nearly
usless.  Lidar will go with visibility.  That leaves you with radar the same
as the aero fighter.  And he is trained to use his IN the atmosphere, and
his is design to work IN his atmosphere.

That was never my argument.  My basic premise was that a TL15 space craft
would be no match for a TL15 air craft in the atmosphere.  I think that the
first poster had the other premise.  The TL15 space crafts laser would
decide the battle with the TL8 fighter plane provided it has the sensors to
use it in the atmosphere.  If the fighter get off his heat seakers the space
ship is toast.  Under CT combat rules an F15 carries more than enough
missles to overload the fighter laser capacity for the less than one turn it
would take them to arrive.
 The fighter could fire from over the horizon or behind a clould bank and be
safe from the space ships laser.  Their radar would not be bothered but most
space based sensors could not see through the clouds.  Given the lack
integration shown in the imperial navy they could have a bad time of it
against todays US military.  Almost any of todays units can act as a pointer
for nearly any of our weapon systems.  A infantry man can target for 16\'
navy guns, 200mm morters, tomahawks, bombs, howlitzers, tanks, and missles
with the same hand held device.  He can also call in self guided and seaking
weapons.  I find it a little hard to believe the far furture weapons systems
are as pourly integrated as they as portray to be in traveller.

>BTW I believe a TL15 airsuperiority fighter is more likely to be a sphere
>than a plane.
>

I dought it.  Drag would kill your speed.  No matter how many Gs you have
you still have to deal with terminal velosity and wind effects.  A sphere
has a terminal velosity around 200-280 mph at one G.  That is the point when
air resistance cancel out acceleration.  The effect is non linear and goes
through some wierd permutations arround the speed of sound.  At those speeds
you are talking some serious design limitations.  One small mistake in your
surface geometry and the wind tears your ship apart.

Keep in mind that there is a *big* difference between
a "martial art" and "unarmed combat". A martial art is
limited to certain moves and techniques when used against
an opponent. Practice of a martial art is for perfection
of form.

An unarmed combat methodology is studied to optimize the
use of the human body\'s assets in order to cripple or
kill, as fast as possible, an enemy who wants to kill you.

Martial arts are derived from unarmed combat but is often
confused with it (thanks to Hollywood). If you make a mistake
with a martial art, you\'ll likely wind up with a bruise.
You mess up with unarmed combat, odds are you\'re dead.

Also, keep in mind the Vilani armed forces have for centuries
waged "no holds barred" combat. They are trained to view
an opponent as "the Enemy" who deserves no mercy. This has
been documented in "Vilani and Vargr", I believe. Given
this predilection, any opponent who uses a martial art
rather than unarmed combat against Vilani troops will more
than likely lose.

I\'d say the Zho armed forces would be just as merciless as
the Vilani and any open-hand techniques would be just as
deadly. Would they have various martial arts disciplines
for civilians? I\'m not sure; after all, such a controlled
and "well-adjusted" society would be very unlikely to allow
or need the development of such practices.

People keep saying this, but it\'s not true. A black foam shield at 1 AU
will rapidly heat up to room temperature from sunlight, easily
detectable by thermal infrared against space. If it\'s a white
shield, it won\'t heat up as much but you\'ll see it by reflected sunlight.
SO you need a black shield and you need to cool it actively,  which means
you need refrigeration, which needs power, which means you need a place
to radiate away waste heat...

Compressed-gas steering jets will only suffice if the target isn\'t
maneuvering-
no compressed-gas jet can match the delta-V of a Traveller starship. (Jets
are for a few tens of meters per second.)

Not a bad concept, but don\'t put a fusion rocket on it; fusion rockets are
visible across the entire solar system. And once the fusion rocket goes off
its course becomes predictable - cold jets can\'t change it enough that
you can\'t keep tracking where its going to be until it comes into LIDAR
range. If you want to surprise someone,
use T-plates. (Expensive and more limited.)

Such weapons do have roles. As you say, in surprise or against targets with
limited maneuverability. IMTU such weapons are refered to as "Kinetic
Lances"
and they occupy a role similar to fireships in the Napoleonic Wars - feared,
but really only useful against targets in harbour or otherwise stationary,
and generally scorned by most combatents.

Insanity is not a term widely used (in my experience) by psychologists,
except when talking about legal issues. The definitions vary from state to
state (although I think there has been a version in Federal law since 1984).

Here is an excerpt from Arizona law (since this is the only reference I
have immediately available):

13-502: Insanity test; burden of proof; guilty except insane verdict

A. A person may be found guilty except insane if at the time of the
commission of the criminal act the person was afflicted with a mental
disease or defect of such severity that the person did not know the
criminal act was wrong. [...] Mental disease or defect does not include
disorders that result from acute voluntary intoxication or withdrawal from
alcohol or drugs, character defects, psychosexual disorders or impulse
control disorders. Conditions that do not constitute legal insanity include
but are not limited to momentary, temporary conditions arising from the
pressure of the circumstances, moral decadence, depravity or passion
growing out of anger, jealousy, revenge, hatred or other motives in a
person who does not suffer from a mental disease or defect or an
abnormality that is manifested only by criminal conduct. [...]

The full citation can be found at:

http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ars/13/502.htm

A very interesting article on the effects of such laws in general can be
found at:

http://www.law.vill.edu/vls/law-review/Volume_39/lafond1.htm

The section titled "Common Misperceptions About The Insanity Defense" is
especially enlightening.

ObTrav: Would there be a definition insanity in Imperial Law? Given the
possibility of quick high-tech treatments (as opposed to long
institutionalization) would the public-at-large stand for such laws?

On which everyone else was commenting and you posted a response. I
erroneously assumed you were commenting on the same scenario (indeed,
re-reading your post I still would assume that). But being corrected, I
have just deleted the 20 min worth of response I\'d been crafting. <sigh>

Not actually true as the 40G superdense, space meteorite resistance armour
on a Rampart will shrug off the damage. Bear in mind the laser on the
Rampart can hit from thousands of kilometres.

The space fighter sits high in near orbit and hits the fighter from over
the horizon...

I agree, and on that basis your argument that the US military would be

Generally I accept this argument, but remember that the Traveller armours
are much much better than those on current air and land vehicles.

the eco system of the enemy world and blockading it until the civilisation

Well, armour is one of the weak points of an airframe design - the extra
surface area will increase the demand for area to be armoured.

Now, you could play games with (say) a general 1cm hull, and a thicker
\'citadel\' along the central fuselage that holds the pilot, weapons, power
plant etc, but it could be ugly to have a penetrating laser hit on your
wing at high speed.

The problem is high accuracy speed-of-light weapons (lasers, PAWs, Meson
Guns) make atmospheric speeds irrelevant.

They see you. Weapon fires. It hits.

Given this, the only things that saves you are armour, and not being seen.

Thus, the either \'Happy Fun Ball\' or the \'Be vewwwy qwiet we\'re hunting
wabbits\' <1> design concepts.

The distances just arent long enough for speed-of-light lag to make agility
important.

>That was what I was discussing, sorry.  I reread the post but as I
>understand it it the space fighter verse athmospheric fighter with all other

My feeling is they\'ll both be Happy Fun Balls, but post up some optimised
airframe designs for us to kick the tyres of.

To me, this says armour up and slow down.

Thus, the Happy Fun Ball, or the grav tank.

Well, you get any two out of high output, high ROF and easy to hide.

The other point to think of is these highly armed CG platforms are
competing in the same air-superiority ecological niche as atmospheric
fighters, except with the different strategy of maximising firepower rather
than speed (they are at the other corner of the good old
speed-protection-firepower triangle)

>>

Well, C-PAWs have big problems in atmospheres. N-PAWs get their problems in
space.

A quick look at the range function for Fusion/Plasma weapons in FFS2
indicates they probably arent going to be able to get their maximum range
out to line-of-sight.

Meson guns ? Yeah. The weapon of choice for planetary defense everywhere.

The other thing to stick in the back of your mind is Gravitic and Neutrino
Sensors. Many of Ditzie\'s projects are based on the assumption that use of
fusion, fusion+ and contragravity can be detected outside line of sight
ranges.

>Under CT combat rules an F15 carries more than enough

Ahhhh, the good old \'one shot per twenty minutes\' assumption.

See Striker\'s rules for point defense, or some more modern design sequence.

> The fighter could fire from over the horizon or behind a clould bank and be
>safe from the space ships laser. 

And their NPAW/Meson Gun, targetted on that nice active AEMS signal ?

> I find it a little hard to believe the far furture weapons systems

Ummm, see the Ortillery rules in Striker. Or in fact the Indirect Fire
rules in Striker. Hell, see any desription of \'Forward Observer\' skill,
which Imperial Marines get in every generation of Traveller I can think of.

With lasers, atmospheric speed is irrelevant.

Oh, I ain\'t griping, mind you.  I followed the playtest.  I thought it was 
fairly thorough.  I may not have contributed, but I was there!

The only place I do have concerns is what to do with my 55 
Maneuver Drive crewmembers during a week in jump space!  That 
ship has a got a crew of 190.  What I do is divide the total number 
of crew by 3.  Then divide the number of maintenance Man Days by 
3.  That\'s how many people are either Preventive Maintaining or On 
Watch during any 3 hour shift.  It works. 

BTW ... I guess I should say, Good Job!  I do like the book.

he\'s still gonna get washed over with pretty hot air), but those around
him may be subject to blinding, singeing, etc.  The inertial compensation
and grav lifters take care of the kick-back and extra weight of the

an old Howitzer (with that flat armor plate thingy, y\'know?) and the front

My GF just recently tried gaming for the first time, and she quite enjoyed
herself!  We\'re definately not talking about a person you would normally
see around a gaming table here, so I\'m pretty happy with the result. I\'m
hoping this good first impression will be the start of something.

Based on this experience, here is my advice for introducing a woman to
gaming (all IMHO): 

1. Use a dirt-simple system.  (like...oh...let me seee...FUDGE? :-)  This
way she won\'t get to thinking that gaming is a boring sequence of looking
up things in tables and so on.  Also, she won\'t be made to feel like a
dummy, which can happen to both genders when they first start out with a
complex system.  This is probably good advice for any first-timer, in
other words. 

2. Have other women there if possible.  The modelling effect is a very
strong determinant of attitudes regarding proper gender role behaviours
(he said like a true psych student).  In other words, if she sees other
women there, she\'ll be more likely to realize that gaming is a "normal" 
and "good" thing for women to do.  This couteracts the unfortunate popular
view that gaming is only for men, and even then is a questionnable
pass-time. 

3. Keep the violence level down.  This depends on the lady in question, of
course (for some the opposite advice would be the way to go! :-), but in
general women are not into massive gore-fests and kinetic ballets of hot
lead.  Emphasize roleplaying, problem-solving and intrigue. 

4. Use a group of 4 to 5 players.  This is large enough that she\'ll get to
experience the social aspect of gaming (which may be the most appealing
part to her) and small enough that she won\'t get washed away by more
agressive players.

Damn, I keep rewriting this, and stills sounds kinda patronizing!  That is
not my intent, of course, I just want to help people get more women into
our fine passtime.  Apologies for any offence.  

So, does anyone have anything to add to this advice?  Any other similar
experiences to report?

Terraserver is a whole pile of fun.. pinpointed my apartment, my job, etc.

But back to Far Trader.  Just below the port scoops, you\'ll se a short
white section over the long black section that runs up from the lower right

the left is a rectangular area.  That\'s the holding lot for shuttle vans.

One problem with it is that a good PE game takes a lot of work to GM.

What do people think about the idea of co-ordinating a game with a team of

ability to do it, but I think it should be possible to have a web interface
that sends splits up orders and send it to the appropriate GM in charge of
each world.

Easily possible. Remember, trade is about relationships. TAS may serve this

Definitly.

Yes. Perhaps this could work informally - your local Subsector Admiral may
have an unofficial list of \'auxilaries\' (perhaps with ex-Navy people on
board) that they provide cut-rate or free maintainence and access to
mil-surplus gear, in exchange for them being available for \'special
missions\', moving stuff the Navy needs moved (but cant justify using one of
their ships for) and acting as auxilaries in wartime.

Well, the Andre Norton novels seem to have a different model of
interstellar government to the Imperium.

I\'d advise you to buy G:T Far Trader, even if you dont use Gurps. It looks
like a great product for your campaign.

No, just stick to CT.

If the rampart\'s laser gets one fire action per twenty minute CT turn,
then your F15 ... "carries the equivalent of one turret"
(to paraphrase High Guard)
So all its missiles combined only equal one factor 2 missile turret.

If you figure firepower of the defences according to the CT abstract
defence factor system and the attack in a TNE style missile by missile
system, you should not be surprised if the results are incompatible.

If you are going to drag manga into it, there\'s a much simpler method.
Just let them know that the IWWW\'s *best* pair of troubleshooters has

Which is why you borrow a page or two from the "how to be a guerrilla"
comics the Chinese used to print. 

You honeycomb the village and other areas with tunnels. One of the
favorites was a sniper position built into the typical "brick stove".
You shoot the trooper who was checking out the hut, and scramble down
the tunnels.

And even low tech geurillas will get the idea that they are being
detected due to the presence of XXX. And once they do, you\'ll get
*lots* of false alarms. And they\'ll find ways to nail you *without*
using XXX.

No, it\'s an example of mixing up two incompatable rule systems and
getting totally confused.

A factor T meson gun is a High Guard spinal mount. That means you
are using High Guard rules, so your Iowa class gets only one of them.
It also means that you cannot put factor anything mesons in the 5"
turrets, because it is not allowed.

Note that the factor T is 7,000std (100,000m3). Adding a 1200 EP power
plant and fuel gives 9,400std or about 130,000m3.
I\'m not convinced this fits inside an Iowa, and you still need the crew,
some armour, factor 9 meson screen, nuclear dampers, a 9 Fib computer
and agility 6 or the Tigress will toast the Iowa.

If you use one of the later rule systems (which would allow multiple
meson guns) the Factor T equivalent is closer to 300,000m3 (I kept the
power input constant at 30,240MW and assumed 250m long and ROF100)
This has a "barrel" diameter of over 18m.
(T4 rules, yet it is still only T4/CUSP factor 16)

I think that you\'ll agree that you cannot put even one of these in an
Iowa, never mind 3 in each turret.

On the other hand, if the factor T meson, is supposed to be a factor
27 weapon in T4, then you end up with a tunnel so big you could put
several Iowas into it, so I don\'t think that conversion would be correct.

   I think this is an overgeneralization.  I could mention a host
of physical ailments that people with DS are prone to suffering,
but I won\'t. "Normal" treatment and catering to their special
requirements won\'t always accelerate their physical and mental
development to match that of people without DS.  There are
greater and lesser degrees of "Retardation". Actually, if you can
focus on its meaning of "delayed" or "slowed" and ignore the
stigma that ignorance and prejudice attach to it, it\'s a
reasonably accurate description.
    As for the value of intelligence, I\'d rather have a DS child
who is the polar opposite (in both intelligence and disposition)
of the other DS lately popular on the list...but then, since I
already do, I could be biased.

The fighter *has to*.  The grav vehicle doesn\'t.

Try designing a space fighter and atmosphere fighter (Striker or FFS) and say
that again.  The atmosphere fighter is going to lose alot more space due to
its airframing.

It\'s called "airframe" which means the space ship *is* a plane.  Contra grav
tech means canonically that airfraft and grav vehicles merge at TL13 (COACC).

Let\'s play the design game.  I\'ll do the space fighter.  You do the

Quite debatable.  Especially if this innovative concept of "airframe" is used
on the space fighter.

So design your apple.  The discussion was about an F22 against a Rampart.
We\'re having the new discussion now, it seems.  :-)

Err...  we have an LOS lightspeed weapon.  Don\'t *have* to face you and can
hit you a helluva way off.  Manuever inside atmospheric against such weapons
is unlikely to be able to evade a laser.  Reference the archived kkm
discussions.

Not in the premise of the original discussion.  It was claimed that Traveller
space ships didn\'t have have high enough G endurance.  The combat situation
was in space.  Then it lowered into an atmosphere where grav vehicles still
have an advantage.  No stall, the ability to make all the aerodynamic
maneuvers, loads more armor and heavy weapons.  An order of magnitude more
distructive.  Being a space and atmosphere fighter.  Imagine that.

Who says?  That\'s ludicrous.  You do actually play the game right?  First
design your atmosphere fighter.  Then run a combat and tell us the results.
I\'ve seen a few grav tank vs space military ships vs civilian space ships
(trader class ships).

You\'re going to have a design an atmosphere fighter with "many several" lasers
and the performance you\'re hinting at.  I\'d really like to see it and will
consider that claim to be apocryphal until I do.

When you design an *airframed* space fighter and put in atmospheric flight
avionics (especially terrain following), you\'re taking all of that into
account.

AEMS is everything that radar is and alot more.  Everything from longwave
radio to gamma rays, and everything in between.  Far more advanced than
anything in any plane today (though an awacs type job might have the advantage
of dedicated equipment, though even that could probably be debated by the pure
capabilities of integrated usage of EMS, densitometers, NAS, and LADAR sets
that are common on good military ships of greater than 1k dt).  Putting that
in a dedicated EW space fighter is more than possible.

This has already been countered by someone else.

Highly debatable.  The distance is paltry.  The range for full effect (in TNE
it\'s 1/10-30, which makes a final pen value up to 312) in a standard
atmosphere for the ramparts laser (144Mj) has a range of 6,000 km.  In a dense
atmosphere, it\'s half that (3,000 km).  Maybe you think a cloudbank will cut
the performance by even more than a "dense atmosphere"...  How much?  Cut it
by a 1000 times and I can still get you from 6km.  Traveller space lasers are
powerful.

  {
    'body' => 'As I said in part 1, or should have said if I didn\'t, these notes
are my way of doing things in a FUDGE like way.  

I\'ve boosted the damage capacity scale for characters somewhat
because I want to use damage numbers for weapons more like CT (or
GURPS).  Let me also say that, in the spirit of FUDGE, everything
here is a guideline and subject to fudging as the situation merits.

Eris

INJURY AND WOUND CLASSIFICATIONS

In FUDGE there are seven classifications of injury or wound:

0 NONE -- The blow did no discernible damage and, other than
producing a FAIR chance of the character aborting his current
action, has no effect on play.  Most punches and many kicks fall
into this category.  The character may notice they are nicked and
bruised after combat, or perhaps the next day, but that is all.  

1 SCRATCH -- This category\'s name comes from the movie expression
"It\'s only a scratch!"  Injuries or wounds in this category
definitely hurt and have a GREAT chance of causing the character to
abort his current action.  SCRATCHES accumulate and if the character
gets scratched often enough he will become more seriously injured.
A few punches, a fair number of kicks, and most club blows fall into
this category.  A SCRATCH is the least amount of damage you can
expect from an small edged weapon or pistol.

2 LIGHT WOUND/MINOR INJURY -- Now the character is taking enough
damage to affect his actions.  He will abort his current action,
have a FAIR chance of being knocked down, but only a POOR chance of
being knocked out.  All future tasks he attempts will be one level
harder until this injury is healed.  A few punches and a few kicks
will cause a a LIGHT WOUND, as will a fair number of club blows.
Small edged weapons and light pistols most often cause this sort of
injury.  This is the least amount of damage you can expect from a
larger edged weapon (sword), heavy pistol, or light rifle.

3 SERIOUS WOUND/MAJOR INJURY -- A character taking a blow this
serious is likely to be "out of a fight."  She will lose her current
action, have a GREAT chance of falling down, a FAIR chance of being
knocked out, and all future tasks will be two levels harder until
this wound is healed (or reduced to the MINOR category where tasks
are one level harder).  If a Seriously Wounded character continues
to act she runs a MEDIOCRE chance of increasing her injury and there
is POOR chance that the wound will worsen without treatment.  All
edged weapons and guns can produce SERIOUS WOUNDS, amd this level of
injury is common from single wounds inflicted by swords, heavy
pistols and light rifles.

4 INCAPACITATED -- The character is definitely "out of the fight",
falling down and lapsing into unconsciousness from a blow of this
severity.  After he recovers consiousness all tasks are four levels
more difficult until the wound can be reduced, and he has a GOOD
chance of injuring himself more severely if he does anything other
than lie still, and even then there is a MEDIOCRE chance the wound
will worsen without immediate treatment.  Even standing up takes a
GREAT effort.  Heavy edged weapons (great swords, war axes) and
rifles will often cause this level of injury with a single blow.

5 NEAR DEATH -- The character is not only INCAPACITATED, but is in
danger of dying within a few minutes.  Only immediate treatment to
stabilize his injuries will save this character.

6 DEAD/DESTROYED -- It is up to the GM to decide when this occurs,
but if a character takes damage far beyond NEAR DEATH...well, "He\'s
dead, Jim!"

NOTES:	

 1.  A blow to the head does double damage.
 
 2.  A blow to arms or legs does half damage.

 3.  A Critical Success (success by 3+ levels) does double damage,
    and may give other advantages.

	(SPECIAL NOTE:  A Critical Success on an injury to the head does
     *4* times normal damage!)


DAMAGE CAPACITY

I am using Constitution or Endurance for this value, however Size
(the sheer mass of the character) really should come into play here.

Specie    CON Rating     Capacity
- ----
Humans  Superb, or greater  5
        Poor+ to Great+     4

character. Multiply the character\'s Wound Capacity by...
  
  1 SCRATCH
  2 LT WOUND
  3 MAJ WOUND
  4 INCAPACITATED
  5 NEAR DEATH

...for the maximum points that character can absorb at that level
from a single blow/injury.  Use the example of a human with a FAIR
Constitution rating below as a guide.

When a SCRATCH is taken put an S in the left most empty box.  When a
LT or MAJ WOUND is taken put an X in the left most empty box of the
appropriate level, or the first empty box to the right of that
level.


STUN DAMAGE

All weapons that blast, burn, crush, puncture and cut a body do some
amount of stun damage in addition to any lethal damage they do.
Edged weapons and guns generally do equal amounts of stunning and
lethal damage, but some attacks, primarily clubs, punches and kicks,
do more stunning damage than lethal.

Weapons with an (S) modifier in the following table do half lethal
damage, but full stunning damage.  The effects of stunning attacks
last during the current combat, but have fewer and milder lasting
effects.  A character may be staggered and fall down, stunned into
unconsiousness, and have lowered ability to perform tasks, but a
*stun*, in and of itself, can not kill and won\'t last far beyond the
current combat. Of course, the acompanying Lethal damage can.

Place an S in the appropriate box of the Stun line of the Wound
Track, as per lethal damage, and check for falling, unconsciousness,
and loss of skill, *and* place an X (for LT or MAJ WOUND) or S (for
SCRATCH) at the appropriate level for 1/2 the number of points
rolled in the box on the Lethal line of the Wound Track.

NOTES:

 1. Melee weapons depend, at least in part, on the Strength of the
    weapon\'s user, so STR is included in the damage calculation.
    
 2. Coordination (DEX or AGL) is important in melee combat in the
    role of making a hits and critical hits more likely, not in the
    amount of damage the weapon does.
    
 3. Some ranged weapons fire armor piercing projectiles.  These are
    represented with a (#) modifier in the above table.  Two points
    of Armor is penetrated for each point the weapon generates.
    
 4. Weapon damage is close to that produced by GURPS, but is fudged
    somewhat..what else do you expect. ;->
    
 5. Ranges are somewhat fudged at this time, but follow a basic
    format of (Effective Range = ER):
    
      ER/8  Contact 
      ER/4  V Short
      ER/2  Short
      ER    Effective
      ER*2  Long

      ER*8  Extreme

Colour.  Unless they\'ve changed since WoTC took them over it sure isn\'t
quality.  AD&D 1st ed. was decent, but second edition has simply been about
making a buck.
Needless to say, I\'ve picked up a lot of 1st ed stuff and about 3 2nd ed.
books.

I think (and an currently experiencing) this issue, abet in a closely
related context. You have observed, correctly, that those in a given
society are importing talent to make breakthroughs. You have no data no the
relationship of said talent to the making of those breakthroughs.

My experience is that within a given society e.g. IBM everyone is
indictrinated, made homogenious to that society, in short they
live/think/breath/imagine inside that box. While they will progress the
technology of e.g. IBM they will do so by conventional means, one
shuffeling step at a time. By importing talent you have someone/thing with
fresh/out side the box concepts or approach. They bring change by different
perspective to a situation/problem, i.e. they enable jumps or lateral
progression.

The flipside (also my experience) anyone within a confined society are
often xenophobic and resist any source of cross fretalisation of ideas,
making them notable through rearity. Another style of management insists
that source of cross fertalisation is temporary ammounting to intelectual
or effort pillageing e.g. large corps that scout talent from universities
use it (hard)as bonded labour then as it transforns into drones like the
majority of its employee base, and then dismiss them.

I suggest that what you have observed here is the benefit of cultural cross
fertalisation and a strong argument infavour of cultural diversity.

[snip]

Again while I appriciate thre point, but my current experience is at odds
with you here. By your admission Pournelle & Heinlien (1979) bemoned the
lack of forsight or intelegence of leaders in failing to ensuer an adiquate
pool of suitably educated labour. We can see this in Real Life (tm) with
the ministrations of Bax Bradford (NZ Minister of Tertiary Education),
prevoiusly Wyatt Creech (NZ Minister of  Education). Who are manipulating
sections of the higher educationed labour pool by modifying the cost of
specific education paths to encourage/discourage entry. These are directly
related to anticipated earnings once in the work force not to projected
workforce vacancies.

This results in very compedative if well paid sectors of an ecomomy and
underpaid and undertrained sectors with significant dissafected labour
turnover.

Trav Obs:
In a command economy it is possible to allocate a given number of education
slots to given career paths. Within the Third Imperium the restraints on
educated labour are relatively few. To maimtain that pool of educated
labour in the face of vacancies in another economy requires intellegence or
dictitioral methods.

In the case of high law level systems this can be used to help explain the
restriction on travel. Educated labour might not be owned but contracted
and indentured, with uneducated population being more able to travel if
only the could afford it.

I\'ve heard that before.  I was at the Game Developer\'s Conference last week.
And thats all business.  Big business.

Yet what does my C.O.O. discover when he goes to meet the staff of
Interplay (publishers of Baldur\'s Gate) about a business deal between them
and us [shameless plug omitted but follow the URL in my Sig if interested],
these business executives were up all night the evening before playing good
ol\' pencil and paper AD&D.  They said they hadn\'t done so in 10 years.

Now if only I could convince Marc M. to license Traveller to Interplay
(no offense to Fenris-Wolf, I\'ve never seen their products), since their
own executives have ably demonstrated how a Computer RPG
rejuvenates interest in the traditional form.

When you said "Ace Hardware" when talking about space merchants, it

Anyone ever thought of using _that_ environment as a model for Traveller ?

Well, actually, even using TL-8 materials, there are several ceramics that
have perform very well in the thermal shield role.  For example, the tiles
used by the space shuttle don\'t become warm to the touch until well after
reaching incandescence.  The NASA video showed a scientist picking up a
peice after it had been subjected to an acetelyn (sp?) torch long enough to
glow white-hot.  The scientist used his bare hands.  Given 7 more TLs I find
it hard to believe that a material that doesn\'t fit the bill better will
come along.  Even worse, simply put the missile in a black globe.
Expensive, but not likely to shot down, either.

Isn\'t there an undocumented feature in FFS2 (FFS1) that forgot about
minimum tunnel lengths for meson weapons which means Ditzie gets more

Actually Gary, I looked into this: Contragrav is only a T4 and a TNE
artifact. MT uses \'antigrav modules\' on ships below 20dt. This are
functionally a cross between CG and a T-Plate. The Rampart (MT design
version in Ref\'s companion, Arrival Vengeance) has the Anti Grav drive, not
T Plates. So I can see where Charles is coming from, even though his space
craft may have trouble landing if non-airframe. The Rampart is an Airframe
design.

>So design your apple.  The discussion was about an F22 against a Rampart.
>We\'re having the new discussion now, it seems.  :-)

Charles did change the frame of the discussion - I reread the thread. It
just wasn\'t clear he had done so.

You\'d better agree design systems, because I think you\'re talking either:

CT with HG and Striker.
MT with COACC
FFS1
or
FFS2

Or use your 6G to climb out of the atmosphere and kill your opponents cheap

The problem with this defense concept is that it relies on a large number
of stonecutters being available for weapons duty :-)

The other problems is I start attacking your oceans (tidal waves etc) and
really start to hurt your ecology as I use nukes and deadfall KK munitions.
Maybe even a few small rocks from mass drivers a la the Centauri on Narn in
B5.

	Therefore I would imagine that Imperial nobles will be scrupulously polite
people.  First because the risk having to fight a duel if they offend another
noble.   Secondly, an emperor of whatever calibre simply cannot know or pay
attention to the behavior of trillions of citizens, however, he can become
reasonably aware of the characters of the members of the nobility.  The nobles
will find it in their best interest to behave in a very un-Cliff-like manner. 
	On their homeworlds, nobles may act in a hig-handed and intolerable manner,
but on other worlds they risk offending either the noble responsible for the
world or the emperor and so would also be on their beter behavior.
	So, publically all nobles would be models of correct behavior (incidentaly
the thing that most commends an aristocracy)   but in private, those with bad
characters will act badly, those with good characters will act well.

I wasn\'t aware of the Rampart\'s configuration. I was making the
(apparently unfounded) assumption that it was *intelligently* designed.

Well, the hulls of Traveller ships are a bit sturdier than that. And
there are various means of dealing with the friction. Tiles like on the
shuttle, playing games with electrostatic fields to "guide" the plasma
around the hull instead of across it, and who knows what else. 

BTW, titanium is *not* that high a melting point. Try something like
tungsten carbide!

As for your other points, they are ok, but I was concerned with his
mistaken impressions about g-ratings and performance.

Possibly. But you *then* have to deal with speed of light lag. The ship
doing the controlling is seeing where the target (and the missile,
incidentally!) was at some point in the past. If you are 5 hexes away,
then you\'ll be looking at where the missile and target were .5 seconds
ago, and your commands will take *another* .5 seconds to get there.

This makes steering *very* hard.

my thoughts (feel free to ignore them ;-) ).

For me, the best thing about Far Trader is it allows the
calculation of the volume of passenger traffic between worlds,
current passenger volume, passenger availability by type, and
ticket price negotiation. All the formulas are simple to use
(i.e. no calculator is necessary, IMO).

For those of you who don\'t care about these, Free Traders also
includes rules for stock markets, speculative trade, stock futures,
market performance, dividends, ship insurance, in-system traffic
control procedures and navigation aids, jump-point masking by stars
and planets, starport arrival/departure procedures, customs
inspections, freight handling, merchant character generation, piracy,
and additional merchant ship deckplans.

And more...

Some may want to tweak some of the economic rules to suit their
tastes but there has *never* been a Traveller supplement
published by *anyone* which has so much usable information
and ideas pertaining to the economics of starships and the
Imperium. Not even by GDW. This one supplement is useful for
_any_ version of Traveller, including home rules, and even
non-Traveller campaigns.

Whether you\'ve been playing Traveller for over a decade or just
starting, if you buy nothing else related to GURPS: Traveller,
buy Far Trader.

You won\'t regret it.

There was a fairly decent movie named _Space Truckers_ made a few years
ago.. I don\'t remember it getting to out theaters, but caught it on
Showtime a few times.

Deniis Hopper plays a crusty in-system long hauler who gets pushed into
hauling a sealed load to Earth orbit.  Along the way he and his fiancee and
the newbie kid get captured by pirates, etc., etc.,..

Pretty decent idea and a gold mine for NPCs, settings, flavor text and the

ObTrav: I have yet to Ref a game where the entrepreneurial bent was
toward anything that did not require a starship or a pile of military
hardware.  Might a Campaign where the characters open a casino or a
weapons store be a challenging and exciting scenario, rife with pitfalls
(and pratfalls)?

Of course, no plausible laser could vapourise a 1 tonne missile, but (for

No matter how good your target tracking is, if the target can maneuver at
Traveller levels you can\'t hit it with a ballistic-course weapon. The target
can track the missile until it goes ballistic, predict its course, and
move out of the way *easily*.

Actually, IIRC, the ideal (as in least-drag) shape for an object travelling
through a fluid, is a teardrop, going rounded-end forward.  That\'s why
Lensmen ships were that shape....

Good luck with your shop. At the GAMA con; I talked to many businessmen/women
at all three levels (retail,distributor,manufacturer). A LOT had either a
partnership (often husband/wife) of two or more people that covered both the
creative/gaming end, and the beancounter/business end, or a staff that had
both professional managers and creative people. Often the business people
weren\'t gamers. This combo works VERY well. My local FGLS has the husband
doing the day to day stuff (when he\'s not gaming...:-)), and his wife does the
books...

Well, it could be intelligently designed (though the one in BL wasn\'t- no MFD.
too much for the pilot to do, etc) and it\'s just the artwork that bites.  It\'s
usually drawn looking like a big missile with some canard-looking things
rather than actual "wings."  IIRC, they\'re said to be retractable, too.

Hmm...  You\'re right.  How do these antigrav "modules" behave?  Just by the
wording, it would imply it acts like CG.  I don\'t see anything in the SoM...

Naturally, I\'m most proficient with and prefer FF&S1.  I can manage MT &
COACC, though it leaves a bad taste in my mouth whenever I try.  I have FFS2
but have never used it for anything other than data mining for TNE.

I\'m at the opposite here.  I think 2nd ed both looks and is alot better than
the 1st.  Course, I hardly crack the covers and either my 1st or 2nd ed books
anymore and the long running campaigns ended w/ my last TNE campaigns (having
largely been supplanted by).  The 1st ed looks like crap to me, and always
seemed kinda quirky when using, especially the books I term "edition 1.5"
(Oriental Adventures, the Dungeoneers and Wilderness Survival Guides, etc).

You\'re not a M:0 Campaign owner are you?  $29.95.  Compare that to the
StarDrive book.  I don\'t even play Alternity or StarDrive and I\'d buy it
first.  Any day of the week.  How much was the base T4 book (hardback)?  Lump
Starships and First Survey and Emperor\'s Vehicles in there and you might have

If you have a problem with \'furries\' then you haven\'t seen good furry
fiction, yet.

The Fanzine that I contribute to (and act as technical consultant on) has
just printed our Issue #20.  The universe isn\'t very much like Traveller,
but we have some great stories about the crews of the freighter \'Tai Pan,\'
the pirate \'Ikotome,\' the research vessel \'Ramanujan\' and the luxurious
\'Quantum Lady.\'

I agree.  2nd edition D&D blew the doors off 1st edition.  It was well worth the
money in my book.

And, someone was speaking about blowing $100 on playing a role playing game.  I
still say that gaming is one of the cheapest hobbies out there--if you calcuate
how much time you invest in it versus the dollars you spend on movies, plays,
going to a baseball game, or whatever.  Gaming is just down right cheap--when you
figure that if you weren\'t gaming that night, you probably would have been
spending about $20-30 bucks that night, with the same guys, out at the local pub,
playing pool or throwing darts and drinking a beer.

What we do in my game is pass the hat.  Periodically (about once very three
months) I\'ll pass the hat.  Each player coughs up $20 bucks.  I throw in a 20
spot myself.  That gives us $100 to go out and buy gaming material with, so we
load up.  My reward for spending the extra time I put into the game as a GM is
ownership of the books.

This is a great system, and we have a large library.  No body is hurt monetarily
($80 bucks a year, spread out over three month periods, is nothing).  And, our
game continues with everything we could want--all of us having a blast.

I recommend this if you are not already playing this way.

Barring the black globe option, it\'s set by the laws of thermodynamics. If
a material is absorbing 1000 W/m2 of sunlight (which a black object will be)
it has to radiate 1000 W/m2 of heat at some infrared wavelengths. If it
radiates less heat than that, it\'ll warm up until it does radiate this much
heat. It\'s a fundamental consequence of the laws of thermodynamics.

Shuttle tile stuff mainly demonstrates that it\'s a good inulator - if one 
side is white-hot the other can still be cold - not that it won\'t absorb
and reradiate heat. It\'ll do a good job of stopping heat generated inside
the missile from getting out, or heat from outside from getting in, but
the surface has to be radiating away the heat it\'s absorbing unless it\'s
actively or passively refrigerated.

Actually, you\'ve got science exactly *backwards*. Science is based on
the fact that it is *impossible* to "prove" something. You can only
*disprove* it. So science concerns itself with things that can be
tested. And requires that there be a way to *disprove* something before
it can be accepted as a theory.

So science is based on the idea that the *dis*-provable is false. It
doesn\'t claim to know "the truth". It claims to have a set of rules
that have weathered all attempts (so far) to disprove them. 

This works better than anything else we\'ve found so far, and in fact,
when the rules get changed, it\'s a matter of the old rules turning out
to be a "special case" of the new ones. That is, under more common
conditions, the new rules are indistinguishable from the old ones, it\'s
just when you get into extreme conditions that you can find a
difference.

This pretty much *has* to be true or the old rules wouldn\'t have given
right answers.

And then there\'s "electrostatic confinement". There was an article

Afraid not. You are forgetting the velocities involved. The higher the
velocity the more powerful the "steering jet" has to be  to cause the
*same* course change (in terms of angle).

You have to be steering all the way in or else using *large* amounts of
power for those terminal course corrections.

A "compressed gas steering jet" is good for a vector change of *maybe*
200 m/sec. Add that to a forward vector of 100 km/sec, and you get a
vector change of arctan(200/100,000)= 6\'53" or about 1/9th of a degree
course change.

Now consider that you are likely talking about missile velocities in
the *thousands* of km/sec, and you see why the corrections have to be
made continuously or else be made with the full power of the drive.

The problem is that for the scenario you just described, you have to be
able to determine the target\'s position an hour or more ahead of time.
That is, you\'ve got to be able to aim the missile at a point it will
reach in an hour *and* have that point be quite close to the position
the target will have at that time. 

On *minor* course change and the target will pass by outside the
missile\'s intercept cone. 

You have to consider the *scale* involved. Hiding behind a gas giant
works, but it automatically makes the range many light seconds or more.

Alas, I\'ve been thru this. The only targets "predictable" enough are
planets, asteroids and orbital stations.

I\'d be more inclined to use Soma cubes. For those of you who haven\'t
encountered these time wasters, they are a bunch of pieces made up of
3-4 cubes each (sort of like tetris pieces, but in 3-D). They can be
assembled into cube 3 times the size of the cubes making up the pieces.
There are millions of ways of assembling them into a cube. There are
*trillions* of ways of assembling them so that they *can\'t* form a
cube. :-)

A couple of years ago a few of us carved out a niche on undernet where
Travellers could go and chat the hours away about ship design and all
manner of things such as we discuss here on TML, except in a real-time
fashion.  We used to have regularly scheduled chat sessions and generally
it was a lot of fun. I thought it was time to remind everyone that it is
still there.

The channel is currently undergoing renovation. We\'re converting it into a
virtual TAS Lounge and it is open during construction.

Now, I have a problem. Every good lounge/bar type entity needs a really
good name and while I\'m very happy to manage the place, I suspect many of
you can come up with really good bar names and probably already have for
the games you are in. So...

I\'m inviting all patrons of #Traveller Undernet to wander by and give one
of the bartenders (ops) suggestions for names. Suggestions will be taken
until the end of April. If you can\'t catch a bartender online, email me
privately, please.  I\'ll try to post all new entries as soon as possible to
#Traveller Undernet\'s new website. Ok, that\'s under construction, too. Bear
with me, I\'m working on it. 

http://home.att.net/~websuz/
 
And since we\'re converting to a bar/lounge atmosphere, I\'m going to have to
have a stock menu of drinks from the Imperium to stock and train the
bartenders to make . I know we\'ve been through this before (did anyone keep
a list?), but I\'ll make the topic of the week Drinks of the Imperium. Stop
by Wednesday or Thursday evening. I\'ll be along by 7pm Central (ouch, when
does DST change? I\'m in AZ we don\'t go there...). Hint:  Whatever night
appears to be busiest, is probably when future chats will be scheduled.

Ok, I\'ve blathered on long enough. See you on #Traveller Undernet!

Sounds like missiles in any version of Traveller with a 6G limit and
non-nuclear pumped warheads are useless, assuming no handwaves.

Do note that Ireland is attracting a *lot* of artists (and possibly
other skilled types) these days. Apparently they\'ve deliberately set up
their tax laws to give such folks a break. They\'ve realized that these
folks bring in lots of money to the local economy. Enough to more than
make up for the taxes lost. And they are "low impact" environmentally. 

That\'s why a lot of authors live in Ireland these days. :-)

AHA!  So, we develop a material that doesn\'t radiate heat until it reaches
an absurd temperature.  There will be many, many circumstances when the
fighting will be out past 1 AU or in the presence of a star weaker than Sol.
Even then, the missile only needs to take it for a limited period, and there
is no guarantee of the "warhead" being towards the sun

Anyway, passive EMS masking, per MT rules, blocks IR signature, wether from
internal or external sources.  For a vehicle this small, it\'s not really too
expensive.

  Heck, even T4 was arguably playable with the main rules and M:0, and the

  For another comparison (albeit non-SF) Hoghead\'s "Warhamster Fantasy

Which is essentially the case with the A-10. The pilot sits in a
titanium "bathtub". Pilots *like* being protected.

Not entirely true. For example, airships get torn apart by weather that
a jet fighter can fly thru unharmed (though the jet pilot would rather
*not* fly thru it!)

Likewise, craft that *don\'t* need wings for lift can get by with
"stubby" airfoils to aid in steering. That allows them to be even
*more* compact, and thus much stronger. 

A properly designed aerospace fighter (pure rocket/thruster or thruster
& CG) will likely be a hypersonic needle with stubby fins so it can use
the air to help it turn. It\'ll be able to endure conditions that\'d rip
a aerodyne[1] to shreds.

But things like clouds help a *lot* by dispersing laser fire and
interfering with sensors.

I suspect that due to airflow considerations, a "happy fun ball" will
be *at least* an oblate spheroid (take a ellipse and spin it around the
short axis). Possibly even a "lens" type shape. Sharp leading and
trailing edge for better supersonic airflow, but the radial symmetry
allows it to pin around a vertical axis without affecting airflow much.

So this thing that looks like a classic "flying saucer" goes zipping by
at *high* speed, and has its main gun firing at you the whole time!
Heck, the "slow spin" even brings the main drive around to decelerate
you to make the next pass!

I can even see some slight changes giving such a shape the ability to
make a steep glide if it loses the main drive.

Well, I don\'t have a set of design rules more recent than High Guard,
so I can\'t do it. But I think the "saucer" and the "finned needle" are
both worth checking out.

Actually, you won\'t run into even *rain* if you are up in the
stratosphere. And birds are rarely found much above 10-20 thousand
feet. :-)

BTW, the SR-71 isn\'t a bad choice as a starting point for a very high
speed, high altitude fighter. Just consider what it would look like if
those *huge* engines were replaced with something inside the main body
(thruster plates). The delta wing would get even smaller because the
engines wouldn\'t be screwing up the airflow. And gee, you wind up with
something approaching my "finned needle". 

For that matter, can one of you gearheads figure out how powerful a
fusion plant you can cram into the space those engines take up? Pity we
don\'t have design rules that\'d allow for "fusion heated air" as an
engine type. But I bet the thing would still have performance that\'d
have the boys at the Skunk Works drooling.

If I was a relatively poor planet, I\'d build *fast* missiles with CG
homing capability. Say something like the old Sprint anti-missile
system. 200g for 5-10 seconds will put the missile 25-100 km up, moving
at 10-20 km/sec. 

Most Traveller weapons aren\'t geared for stuff moving that fast.
There\'s a *damn* good chance that a Sprint could take out anything
withing range (especially if they have nuclear warheads). 

And the old HAARP program had test vehicles with *thousand* g
acceleration. Sure, the endurance is lousy. But they\'ll be deadly if
you are in atmosphere or low orbit. 

And this is all 1960s technology!

[1] aerodyne: aircraft relying on aerodynamic forces for lift as
opposed to aerostats which rely on static forces (bouyancy) for lift. 

So, basicly aerostat=balloon/dirigible. Aerodyne=most other current
aircraft. 

Traveller has CG aircraft and aircraft that stay aloft by virtue of
pure thrust.

  The Striker box covers that - an aircraft with fusion plant, rocket

  IIRC, the conclusion on Trav-Tech (and the consensus on SF-CONSIM) is
that the more realistic the technology the less useful contact or close-
proximity warheads are against defended targets. Given that most Traveller
simply isn\'t space opera it becomes difficult to maintain the original B:2
premise of contact missiles; of course, GDW itself made great efforts 
later on in aid of finding more supportable roles for missiles in Trav.

Sadly it\'s too easy to begin. Convince the US government to (turn a buck)

decide that since law is a paying career compared to a structural
engineering that you can charge more tuition fees to law students than to
engineers.

The smart bit is where you (the government) offer these real hoopy student
loans to everyone, that way you\'ve got an indentured work force. (All
except those in well paying careers who can pay them off.)

In the short term (0-20 years) this isn\'t expected to work. The hard bit is
to get government to tweak this in the name of equity (roman law as opposed
to justice- English law) to have the over filled professions subsidise
under represented professions. This is contrary to the concept of free
market forces which we started with. But we do have a large body of
saleable debit, aka student loans. By selling this debit to those companies
that need the specifically education workers, there is a demand for e.g.
Engineers.

In the medium term (20-40 years), if we go down the path of selling
marketable debits and receiving return on high paying professions we will
have an economy that can afford to permit non-core/uneconomic occupations.
This is how: once lone viable professions have paid their life style
debits, established permanent relationships, and form stable life paths
they have excess income which can be spent on the non productive or
tertiary economy. At the same time previously indentured/indebted
professions are coming on line for stable payment of lifestyle debits etc.
This ensures that the lifestyle e.g. mortgage departments of banks retain
business rather than suffer generational surges.

In the long term (40-60 years) the productive sectors are sufficiently able
to support an appropriately sized non productive sector e.g. artists,
philosophers, game designers etc. Such are the joys of market forces, if
government is able to retain a single path of economic strategy.

In this projection I have used 20 year spans to indicate a workers
productive half life (from initial training to full trade proficiency). And
have only used one factor for control of modifying choice of profession.
Other options include the possibility of directly closing enrolment rolls
for some higher education institutions, or deliberately allowing an over
abundance of glamorous professionals with a dearth of competent personnel
in other areas. As noted by Pournelle & Heinlien (1979) in the USA with
Engineers. The greatest down falls are in human cost and ability of a
government to keep a course of action long enough to work (or fail).

Related Trav Seniero Nugget:
Not too far from the Starport one of your crew are met in a Coffee Lounge
by a potential patron. She wants her children (young adults) taken off
planet. She claims they are college students about to graduate who are then
to be sold at auction to any company that will take them. In an extended
conversation she explains the selling of education indentures, a form of
legal slavery. She also gives the players brochures and a long set of
costings (just in case anyone asks).

If the players check the planetary government do sell education, extensive
medical care, contract out expertise, etc. This all keeps the tax rate
acceptably low, almost on par with Imperium average.

Should they accept she can pay them with a mixture of mediocre jewellery,
local currency and trade data (useful to a trader using the skill \'Trader\'
per Book 7 Merchant Prince pages 30-31) for a temporary insight (50 day/
+2) for shipments to this world. The twins are both 22 years old, must be
smuggled onto the starport, not too hard for a group of hardened players to
get two people through a customs border is it. Get them to another world,
for niceness setup in some sort of work and new identities.

Should they ever come back, up the local law level interest in them for the
sake of tension. They may look up their patron, sadly she died in an auto
accident (subtext suicide) shortly after the disappearance of her two
youngest children. Surviving relatives are uncontactable.

** Not bright a future sinario, probably not good traveller, but a

Anyone else like to offer an alternative governmental approach and

the worlds of Traveller. Some comments follow.

* Psychology is that science dealing with the way the mind works. It
includes in its ambit theories of personality development, social
interaction, etc.

Clinical psychology attempts to use some of the more useful ideas in the
treatment of mental illness e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapies for
anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders can trace their ancestry back
to Skinnerian concepts of conditioning.

* Psychiatry is that branch of medicine dealing with the diagnosis and
treatment of mental illness. It currently lacks a unifying theoretical
foundation because of our ignorance of how brain function (at the
cellular level) eventually leads to (dys)functioning individuals.
Like most of medicine, it has an empirical basis, much of which is in
flux at this time with developments in physiology and therapeutics.

Ob Trav : With further technological advancements, the molecular bases
of conditions such as depression and schizophrenia are elaborated.
Increasingly selective pharmaceuticals are combined with environmental
and behavioural therapies wherever possible.

New disorders appear (jump psychosis? post low berth revival delirium?)
while others disappear, with appropriate changes in cultural mores as
well as \'professional challenges\' as to the disease entity\'s existence.

[\'Drapetomania\' - the morbid condition where a slave would keep trying
to escape his/her master\'s property - was a recognised medical diagnosis
in the pre Civil War United States].  

In the Imperium, many of the most advanced techniques (e.g. memory
reading) are either too sophisticated or forbidden because of their
similarity to psionic powers.

* When Is A Creature A Sophont?
Quick criteria :-
i. Creature Factors : adults are large enough to have a brain weighing
at least 900 grams, or have enough cells/synapses (10^11 neurons in
average human brain with 1000X as many synapses). The obvious exception
is hive type organisms ;
ii. Artefacts :- language, tool use, art, other environmental
modification (e.g. buildings, agriculture).

Comments and constructive criticism welcome.

(for which I must take some small responsibility), mentioned the
electric eel as a bio-battery, or a source for bio-electric power
sources.

The electric organs of the eel and some other fishes are modified muscle
and nerve tissue. Impulses are transient potential differences generated
by the establishment of an ion gradient across the cell membrane. This
requires energy provided by the aerobic respiration of glucose and other
substrates, in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).

The eel, as mentioned by Leonard, can discharge enough electrical energy
to cause a horse to undergo cardiac arrest. This would be in the
neighbourhood of 300-400J of energy.

Aside : Defibrillators in clinical use have a maximum discharge energy
of 360J. As little as 50J can be useful in restoring normal (sinus)
rhythm.

Ob Trav : Entire electric organ cells would be required at a minimum for
your hypothetical battery, immersed in an appropriate oxygen, nutrient
and waste removing solution.

Aside : Some fish use weak electric fields for sensing purposes.
Apparently some sharks can sense other fish, etc. via the ampullae of
Lorenzini (spelling check?!) in the front of their heads with this
method.

Well, missiles dont have a 6G limit. They do have a limit, but it\'s higher
than 6 gees.

You can do a fairly neat small x-ray laser, but basically, yeah, missiles
are very much a secondary weapon system, suitable for use by and against
civilians and auxilaries.

The other major problem is the enemy having active sensors turned on. Me, I
believe in full tanks, firepower and active sensors, so I suspect that the
missile wont get to contact range intact.

Sorry, you cant do it. Thermodynamics means you cant block IR signature per

The A-10 is much, much closer to the grav tank in design philosophy than to

But it still cant take damage. It\'s paying too much surface area to get

*shrug* So use PAWs. In any case, point defense lasers end the era of the

In any case, how much would cloud disperse a (say) 100 megajoule laser ?

OK, so a streamlined Happy Fun Ball gets the teardrop treatment.

But the basic question is when you have very, very fast weapons that go out

I was more worrying about lead, lasers, plasma, PAW beams and all the other

Fusion plant ? Not until about TL12 can you put em in anything smaller than
200 m3. In any case, I\'d say fusion heated air is pretty close to Heplar in

Leonard, I have *very* serious doubts about Sprint having the performance

Frankly, I think you are reading reports people wanted to be true, and

That sort of acceleration is just too useful for high-level interceptor
missiles and so on, and those missiles just didnt happen.

They will be if they are designed for counter-insurgency or planetary
intervention roles.

Personally, I think they\'d get picked off by lasers and so on, if they were
being shot at ships who were aware of the fact that these weapon systems
existed.

Definitely. Balls heat up too much at high speed.

Have you seen what one can do with a frisbee ? Doesn\'t need to

I\'d agree that in the real world both shouild be far better than balls unless
they are so overpowered and shielded  they can completely ignore the presence
of atmosphere, in which case there is no need
for any difference betwen aerospace and space fighters

Then again, given the neccessary overpowering to make balls effective in
atmoshere,  just about _any_ shape could be effective, so the shape of
fighters would depend more on aesthetics than engineering.

The "utilitarians" would go round saying how beautiful and functional their
balls looked, and the "freudians" would go round saying how manly and
penetrating their needles looked, and engineering performance wouldn\'t enter
into the decision.

Exactly.

I\'ve always liked giving Travellers surprises with an old technology taken to
it\'s max, which is what will happen with continual refinement and no
innovation, such as would be expected on Vilani worlds.

For instance. Anyone remember the "loiter" bombs of  World War Two ?

Attach a proximity fused bomb to a helium balloon on the end of a several
hundred foot string . Let if float around in a war zone. Sooner or later a
plane will come along and hit the string, the balloon drags back behind the
plane, thus pulling the bomb into contact with the plane....

So does the real world. Two examples are the BAE Electric Lightning and the

Both can / could do Mach1 straight up.

That\'s why I suggested a sphere, as it would give you a shape approximating

There doesn\'t appear to be a canon description, except that an air raft

By the fact it\'s used by the Rampart and airrafts I would assume it is a

Yep. Thing is no-one did anything about it at the time, so now the US _does_
have the lack they predicted.

I fully agree with those who posted saying basically that this is the fault of
corporations not willing to invest in training, but laying blame doesn\'t fix
the problem, and preventing immigration won\'t force companies to train the
staff they need, it will just force them to move operations offshore. What\'s
needed is targetted intervention by government, something Clinton has actually
been trying to do, but as the concept of Federal government interfering in
that sort of thing raises the hackles of State legislatures, it \'s hard to do.

I don\'t agree with that. NZ Government training funding is not related to
anticpated earning, but to actual costs of funding the training.

They are only funding to a certain level of costs for _all_ courses, what this
does is make the individual institutions _either_ increase prices in paths
where training expense are high (which is what Otago U does) ,  _or_
subsidize the high cost courses by charging all students basically a flat fee
that may be slightly higher than it would have been if they charged actual
costs ( which is what Canterbury U used to do, I don\'t know if it still
does. )

However, it just so happens that some high earning professions (dentistry for
example) have high costs.

On the other hand computer science, electrical engineering, or law, don\'t have
as high training costs as the medical courses, but often have as high, or
higher, earnings.

Thus, as a result, students wishing to maximize their return willl choose law
over dentistry, and won\'t even consider arts.

You can assume this was intentional, but I don\'t credit our government with
that much intelligence,
IMO they charged fees merely to reduce their costs, and didn\'t think about the
consequences

For the non-New Zealanders amongst us, New Zealand tertiary education up to
about 1989 was essentially free, tuituion fees were about $500 NZ ($250 US) a
year plus around $200 a year for text books.  Subsidies were cut in about
1990, and students were charged around $2000 a year for a full time course,
and offered loans to pay for this. The government then steadily reduced the
subsidies to a small percentage of the course\'s actual cost.

We still pay less  ( I think? )than equivalent training in the US, but to gain
a dentistry degree one will owe, if unable to pay cash, upwards of $150,000
(again $75,000 US )in student loans.when you get your PhD

So, you in the US will probably wonder what we\'re complaining about

Only if you assume market forces don\'t work. While it\'s not very nice for

is demand, as people try to maximize their returns by training in areas where
there is demand, and other areas will become depleted

Useful adventure hook that. Mercenaries hired by a mega-corp to extract
indentured labour of great economical value to hiring company.

Paralyzed Patients Use Special Computers 

L O N D O N,   March 24  Severely paralysed patients
can now communicate by using brain waves to write
messages on a computer screen, German psychologists
said today. 

The new system, developed by scientists at the University
of Tubingen in Germany, gives a new lifeline to locked in
patients who have no muscle control and cannot communicate.
Using brain waves called slow cortical potentials
displayed on a computer screen, the patients can see their
brain activity and learn to control it.

It\'s crude but it\'s fast becoming an accepted method for

        I went one step further with my lady friend...  I organized a
"Ladies game" of AD&D with some other female friends of mine who gamed
periodically and that went over *very* well...  everyone played archetypal
characters and it was a high-fantasy setting (in other words, extreme
technical knoweldge of "Real World(tm)" triva was not a factor".  We played
several sessions of just stomping through the woods before even getting to
the ruins they wanted to explore, and I tailored the outside encounters to
be more role-playing vehicles than combat opportunites.  For the exploration
of the ruins, I focused on atmosphere and color, and everyone had a grand time.
        In point of fact, while the combats were brutal (in keeping with my
experience to date that women gamers are much more ruthless than men), it
was a refreshing change for me as DM to have a group not focussing on how
big the sword was or how ugly a trap they could spring on a monster.  It was
a wonderfully interesting game from start to finish.

But wasn\'t GURPS Lite and this lite version that you saw both published

After I sent the email, I went back and looked at his old picture (I still 
had it buried in a bunch of old gaming material).  It didn\'t look like it 
too much after all.  I guess the design was just something I 
remembered seeing from somewhere else. Now I know it was.  

Guess I\'ve had my head up my butt for the last couple of days.

Oh, well.  One of those weeks.  Thanks for the response.

CT/Striker/MT: they provide reactionless thrust similar to thrusters, 
but can be installed in smaller vehicles, and lose efficiency once 
they are a certain distance away from a gravity source (MT).  The 
vehicle needs 1g of acceleration (in a 1g field) to hover; excess 
gees are used for maneuvering.

Okay, I\'ve had a look at FFW.

I agree, those stubby wing things aren\'t as big as the wings of
an F15, they look much more like the size of its tail fins.
There don\'t appear to be any elevators, so they must rotate the
whole aerodynamic surface.

So that should mean that the rampart is at least as manoeuvrable
in atmosphere as a modern fighter, even without using its superior
engines.

             CRUSADE, the highly anticipated new series from the
             creators of the Emmy Award- and Hugo Award-winning
             series Babylon 5, will premiere on TNT on Wednesday,
             June 9 at 10 pm ET/PT. Gary Cole, Tracy Scoggins,
             Daniel Dae Kim, David A. Brooks, Marjean Holden, Carrie
             Dobro and Peter Woodward will head the cast of
             CRUSADE. Douglas Netter and series creator J. Michael
             Straczynski will executive-produce for Babylonian
             Productions.

             CRUSADE begins after a savage attack on Earth by the
             Drakh, allies of the evil Shadows. Earth\'s humans have
             succeeded in defeating the alien force, but not its final
             revenge: a biogenetic plague that will eliminate all human
             life on Earth, unless a cure can be found. The White Star
             fleet -- led by the advanced prototype warship Excalibur --

             combs the ruins of races far more advanced than humans
             to find the cure that will save them.

             Cole will lead the cast as Captain Matthew Gideon,
             commanding officer of the Excalibur. Cole also appears in
             the upcoming feature releases A Simple Plan, with Bill
             Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton; I\'ll Be Home For
             Christmas, with Jonathan Taylor Thomas; and Kiss The
             Sky. He recently completed production on Office Space,
             with Jennifer Aniston, for director Mike Judge. His credits

             also include From the Earth to the Moon, The Brady
             Bunch Movie, A Very Brady Sequel, Gang Related
             and In The Line Of Fire, with Clint Eastwood. On
             television, Cole starred in the series American Gothic
             and Midnight Caller and received critical acclaim for his
             role in the miniseries Fatal Vision.

             Scoggins reprises her role from Babylon 5 as Captain

I wonder. Even by a conservative estimate based on the assumption that
Imperial nobles are rarer and more powerful than the equivalent of
present-day heads of state, you\'ll have tens of thousands of them. If you
go by an estimate based on the (IMO) mistaken idea that they are about as
numerous and powerful as 17th Century European nobility, you get billions.

And yes, I know no one specifically _says_ that they are as numerous as
the old European nobility, but that\'s the way they are portrayed in the
character generation rules and the various adventures...

It\'s the existence of drop tanks that "proves" that all the jump fuel is used
before jump. Since the tanks are dropped before the ship enters jump space,
any unused fuel would be dropped with them. What dooms drop tanks in the
opinion of some people (not including me) is that drop tank equipped ships
are more economic than ships that rely on internal tankage and would thus,
if they existed, crowd out such ships (My opinion is that drop tank traffic
requires a minimum volume to be economic, and is in any case less flexible.
That combined with the fact the drop tanks are a recent invention means,
IMO, that they would be found only on major trade routes. Since very few
published adventures take place on major trade routes, the lack of reference
to such ships is not a major problem to me.

It\'s been a while since I read that article, but I don\'t recall that it

Well, sure, but then they wouldn\'t be travelling!

I could see an entire campaign set on a recreaction asteroid or
station:  casino, bars, hotels, and other assorted ventures.
Adventures could include "bad guys" trying to "cut in on the

pirates/merchants/belters/patrolmen just dropping by for a little R

My point was just that it *could* be that the design isn\'t crappy but that the

They do?  Maybe TL-8 lasers, but they aren\'t going to do much to a grav
focused laser.  Not on the scale of planetary combat.

> In any case, how much would cloud disperse a (say) 100 megajoule laser ?

Not very much.  The range of such a laser, even in a dense atmosphere (which
seems close enough to a generic "cloud"), is in the thousands of kilometers.
FTR, a TL-12 100-Mj laser has an effective range of 3,000km (performance:
1/8-25 or penetration up to 212).  To 6,000km, performance is 1/4-13 (pen 64).
This is in a "dense" atmosphere.

Original FF&S is pretty explicit that HEPLaR was just a heat exchanger that
could be powered by any kind of power plant.  All it is is heating lhyd to a
plasma and expelling it out the back.  There are handwaves to explain the
extremely good efficiency, too.  Most popular on the TNE list, it seems, is
the Plasma Focus.  Annti can tell you more, but the basics IIRC are lasers are
used to induce microfusion in hydrogen, which launches plasma out at very high
speeds.  Another possible handwave could be a Blacklight reaction and/or Zero
Point Energy.

Maybe I should have named my ship design bureau "CanonTech" instead of
AuricTech....

Then again, AuricTech gives readers a better idea of the nature of my
designs (gold-plated, all the bells-and-whistles, to excess). <shrug>

I\'m not sure who made the original "Ace Hardware" comment, but for
our non-US correspondents...in the US that\'s the name of a chain of
smallish hardware stores, I think mostly independents with
centeralized marketing/distribution channels.

IMTU, I made the "Spacer\'s Guild" (offical name Space Merchants and
Workers Guild) one of the bad guys.  It\'s stated goals are to
protect the rights of "all those that do trade among the stars"
workers and merchants alike.  However, it is secretly controlled by
a cabel of big shipping companies and criminal gangs who are milking
the spacers with dues and pension fund schemes and squeezing the
small companies and independents off the profitable runs and right
out of business.  

A few of the independents are trying to "organize" a competing
association in the Mark system.  They have recently taken a big hit
when one of their leaders "accidentally" fell 40 stories from the
suite of a notorious loan shark, Pele "Pickax" Hiika.
Coincidentally, the number two Guild representative on the planet
happened to be there at the time and corroborated Hiika\'s story that
"he\'d been drinking and just leaned back over the balcony\'s rail and
fell."  Hiika also claims that the dead man owed him several hundred
thousand in debts, but can\'t produce any paperwork for that "loan."

"Terminal velocity" is the point where drag cancels out the
acceleration due to gravity. It applies to *falling* objects. It also
depends on *density*, since the "propulsive force" is the *mass* of the
object.

A sphere with a 6g drive will be able to go *faster* than terminal
velocity. It will reach a limit at the point where the force of the
drive equals the drag forces. And for a 6g drive that\'s going to be
damned fast!

Not quite. The proper shape depends on density and viscosity of the
fluid as well as speed. There\'s an aerodynamics formula for determining
the Reynolds number based on speed, density and viscosity of the
medium. Situations with the same reynolds number have similar folow
characteristics, and require similar streamlining. 

Teardrops are ok for *subsonic* air. At the time Doc smith wrote the
Lensman stories, the only experience with *supersonic* airflows was
with bullets and shells. Which are *pointed*. 

Supersonic airflows prefer a pointed nose and tail.

Just watch out when the kkm velocity gets up towards c. At some point,
that "vapor" starts counting as particle radiation. And it doesn\'t take
very many joules per square meter of relativistic ions to result in a
fatal radiation dose!

Another mean, rotten trick would be to using sodium or some similar
metal for the "warhead". The result will be lightly plating your ship
with metal. Which *immediately* renders radar useless and tends to
degrade optics. Firing a laser when the emitter has gotten a light
coating of metal will cause a *major* explosion (because the metal
intercepts a percentage of the beam energy, a percentage large enough
to cause a substantial "bang").

They are fairly useless against a prepared opponent with military grade
point-defence. Even the nuke pumped warheads are at a severe
disadvantage. 

Against armed merchants it\'s a whole different ball game. 

I\'d say you\'ve got the following "levels":

1. warned miltary. You can essentially forget it. You\'ll keep his point
   defenses busy, but that\'s about it.
2. surprised military. If you get lucky, you might get a hit.
3. warned civilian. You\'ve got a fair chance of a hit, if you set
   things up right.
4. surprised civilian. You\'ve got a good chance of a hit.

<sigh>

Sorry, but what you saw in that film is *not* what you think. The
material *radiates* just fine. That\'s what the glow is. And the glowing
parts *are* white-hot. 

But the stuff *conducts* heat so poorly that the corners and edges can
cool off to the point where it\'s safe to handle it by *them* while
areas millimeters away are still white hot. 

Touch the *center* of one of those faces and you\'ll get third degree
burns! 

It is *phsyically impossible* to have something that is white hot *and*
cool enough to handle. If you look at the pictures again, you\'ll see
that the corners are dark, and the edges somewhat dark. That\'s because
that\'s were the most surface area attaches to the least volume, making
for the most rapid heat loss via radiation, conduction and convection.

It\'s good insulation, but that doesn\'t help. You have to get *rid* of
heat. Otherwise the materials making up the drive will melt. 

In the space shuttle, the heat doesn\'t work its way thru the tiles
until the shuttle is on the ground. At which point they\'ve hooked up
ventilators to circulate *massive* amounts of cool air thru the shuttle
to keep it livable. In the event of an emergency landing at a normal
airport, the crew will *have* to leave the ship before the internal
temp gets unlivable. They can return in a few hours when things have
cooled down.

Not *possible*. The temperature of an object *is* the rate at which it
radiates and to some extent, the wavelength. If an object is at 300 K,
it *will* radiate X watts per square meter. No exceptions. It *has* to
radiate. If it is radiating less than X watts, then it isn\'t at 300 K.
Period. 

That\'s what Bruce meant about having to refrigerate a surface to reduce
the IR radiation. The radiation rate *is* the temperature. 

> There will be many, many circumstances when the

However the temperature/radiation relationship is a 4th power law. So
the difference between the 3 K background (3 degrees above absolute
zero) and a 300 K object (30 C) is not a factor of 100. It\'s a factor
of 100^4 = 10e8 or 100 *billion*. 

	radiated
temp	energy
- ----	----
   3 K	  1
   5 K	 10
   9 K  100
  17 K	  1e3 	Liquid Hydrogen
  30 K	 10e3
  53 K  100e3
  95 K    1e6  
 169 K   10e6
 300 K	100e6	Room temp, average temp of objects at 1AU
 533 K    1e9
 949 K   10e9
1687 K  100e9 
2000 K	198e9	"standard radiators"
3000 K    1e12

And remember that you have to double the distance from the star to drop
the received energy (and thus the radiated energy of objects in thermal
equilibrium) by a factor of 4. Which will only drop the temp by a
factor of 1.4 ( sqrt(2) ).

So you have to be *way* out before thermal signatures drop
significantly.

Do you have any idea how *big* a Sprint was?  The second stage ignition
occured practically on top of the launcher, too. And they cost like
sin. They just cost a *lot* less than having a nuke hit you. :-)

I\'ve exchanged messages with some folks who worked on the program.

Depends. This sort of thing *is* taking a technology (solid fuel
rockets) *way* out to the extreme edge of practicality.

Which is part of my point. They\'d only exist in systems that were being
recontacted (and not all of those). There are much *better* ways of
achieving the same effect with other technologies.

This is rtather like the situation where you try to protect against WWI
biplanes with modern missiles. They don\'t have the thermal signature
*or* the radar signature for the missiles to pay attention. 

They *can* be picked off, but not by the automated systems. 

This sort of thing is one of those situations that *can* happen, but
doesn\'t happen often. So it\'ll screw you royally if it does happen, but
the odds are against any sort of "standard" precautions being deployed.

I\'m normally the advocate of lasers-as-the-ultimate-weapon, but the one
thing they won\'t do is shoot through clouds. Clouds are (you may have
noticed this) opaque. They absorb and scatter light. A laser beam, no
matter how it\'s focussed or what kind of adaptive correction it has, will
get absorbed and scattered rapidly. This is probably one reason why
plasma weapons are more common than lasers for atmosphere craft/grav
tanks...

TNE in general was somewhat too generous with atmosphere ranges/performance
diminishment (especially for x-ray lasers; the atmosphere is basically
opaque to x-ray lasers.) As a seperate issue, IMTU, grav focus doesn\'t
work through atmosphere; it absorbs the grav pulse. So ground-based
laser weapons are fairly short ranged. Atmospheric turbulence will
degrade laser fire into an atmosphere unless the firing craft is fairly
close, so in general lasers are used to/from orbit, not halfway across
the solar system (makes ground attack more interesting.)

And, as others have said, the debate about what shape atmosphere fighters
should have is fairly silly. Speed and maneuverability don\'t help you dodge
lasers or even plasma fire, so atmosphere fighters have to rely on armour
and on turrets that let them point there weapons in any direction - which
is to say, they become tanks.

There aren\'t any canon designs that have drop tank equipped ships w/o internal
tankage are there?  This is what needs to be outlawed by the design systems
IMO.  The rest can be solved by the Gearheads.

Going on the TNE Gazelle, it has better jump performance w/o the tanks than
with (J5 vs J3), as the greater displacement requires more fuel per jump
level, which follows by common sense.  The Supplement 9 Gazelle still is still
capable of J2 w/o the drop tanks...  

Here\'s my take:  J2 worth (at the higher displacement) is used at the
*instant* of jump, the drop tank\'s fuel is transfered to the internal tankage
and then the tanks ditched giving lower displacement, to be consumed during
the jump, which original FF&S\' treatment handles well.  How\'s that?

What is the CT/FFS2 fuel consumption again?  Some FFS2 gearhead can give us
the appropriate #s.  Is this scenario voided by anything (say Supplement 7)?
The strawman seems to be that J5 is held in a drop tank, jump is started and
the empty drop tanks are ditched and all the J-fuel is consumed in an
amazingly short time (any concrete time mentioned?)...

That\'s just the sort of sticking ones head in the sand, to pretend the problem
doesn\'t exist, that I really dislike.  It\'s characteristic in many places by
people afraid to let to the OTU grow and develop (as if their campaigns have
to be sucked along for the ride) and stagnate.  Drop tanks are just one.

I\'d buy that, too, though I like my solution better.  :-)  My way doesn\'t
require a ridiculous (IMOO) assumption and handwave (nor watery musings) on
the workings of Jump Drive.

Probably the part:

<<Power Source: Jump uses large amounts of energy to rip open the barriers 
between normal space and jump space. Normally only fusion power can 
supply this energy. Some alternate systems make use of solar power 
generators (which operate much more slowly), or anti-matter power 
systems (rare and very high-tech). >>

The part on "Contaminated Fuel" also references the *ship\'s* power plant.
"Power Generation Capability" implies an "equally capable alternative" to
fusion power generation systems must be available.  These bits would both
dispel the DGP/SoM super-quick-plant and the FF&S model (by requiring ship\'s
power).  I\'m completely ignoring the abomination presented in FFS2, which is
completely groundless IMO, as far as canon is concerned (though itself isn\'t
necessarily a "bad" model.  MTU, i\'m thinking all 3 versions are possible,
though the original FF&S\' is most prevalent (and was used in/by the 3I, for
whatever reason)).

They\'re in the original (TNE) FF&S in cybernetics w/ Implant Computers &
neural jacks that can allow all sorts of things (smart links, data storage,
etc) as well as things like therapy, drugs, etc.

Mostly, it has.  Along w/ other issues like nanotech, biotech, etc.  Usually
it\'s blamed on \'Vilani Conservatism.\'  I, on the other hand, prefer to think
the Vilani might have delt with it and developed it, though it would\'ve
naturally been along the stagnant lines mandated by the researcher castes.
Blech.  ;-)

NOTICE TO STARFARERS

	RCSA is pleased to announce the opening of diplomatic relations with the
planet Schotz (1937/So Skire/Old Expanses).  Though the world remains very
reculsive and restricts foreign contact, the Hive Federation has been allowed
to establish a Temporary Base in the outer sytem, that will enable the
refueling of
ships and provide a firm Jump 3 link connecting the Reformation Coalition and
the Hiver client-state in Sitah subsector (Subsector P/Old Expanses).
	Travel to the planet and use of it\'s class C starport will be restricted
until negotiations can be completed, though the use of the Hiver Temp Base
(and all such bases on the Jump 3 link) has been extended to all Coalition
vessels, as well as independant merchants.  Some Assembly representatives have
expressed concern over the reclusive nature of the world and it\'s goverment.
RCES confirms that the world is not ruled by a Technologically Elevated
Dictatorship, just extremely high levels of xenophobia.

It\'s a subpage off http://www.vision-forge-graphics.com/ but I can\'t
remember which one.

It may be quicker going to BITS http://www.bits.org.uk/ then selecting the
jumpsite page, then clicking the direct link to Jesse\'s pages.

The artwork is really, really good.

Certainly QSDS 1.5 (the pdf version). SSDS produces similar results. FFS2
is such a pain to use as released (no offence intended Dave/Guy).

But I\'d use HG in preference to either unless I ...

I notice that they\'ve put production of anything past the first thirteen

I think he\'s thinking more of what if that laser superheats the cloud and
converts vapour to steam, giving massive ionisation efects. I suspect it\'d
give problems with the first few shots, but at a Traveller FFS(x) rate of
fire this may be ultimately irrelevant.

This is what annoys me - T-plates were handwaves, but so is HEPLaR. <sigh>

Could a small version of such technology make space scale plasma weapons
viable?

The BITS website http://www.bits.org.uk/ has been updated as follows:

1) Andrew Moffatt-Vallance\'s Pocket Empires Excel Spreadsheet

	...has been updated to version 1.6.4. This is now a smaller file
than before, and very useful to PE GMs. A MacOS version has been added.
______________
This is a spreadsheet to handle some of the calculations involved in running a
Pocket Empires campaign. The spreadsheet currently:

  -  Calculates the GDP for each world
  -  Calculates Government Income, Fixed Expenses and
     Available Budget for each world
  -  Calculates Popularity and Prestige for each
     individual world
  -  Features a worksheet for calculating the prestige
     of multiworld Empires
  -  Calculates the trade codes for each world
  -  Calculates the initial Resource, Infrastructure and
     Culture scores for each world
  -  Calculates the Resource demand for each world
  -  Calculates the Resource trade benefits for each
     world

Changes to 1.64
  -  Fixed bug in resources available formula
  -  Use of absolute references removes the need to edit
     formula when adding new lines
  -  Added comments to the headers to explain what each
     cell does
  -  Reduced the number of worlds from 350 to 50 so as to
     reduce the size
  -  Added a Mac version
  -  Added non-official viable trade partners option

The sheet is capable of handling up to 50 worlds. To add more worlds just copy
and paste the appropriate lines in the GDP sheet.
________

2) GenConUk 99

	A link to the RPGA site for GenCon UK has been added.

3) Release 2 of 101 Starships for GURPS Traveller

	...will be added soon for your entertainment. We\'ll let you know when.

The glow *is* white-hot, as you say, and you really don\'t want to stick your
hand in front of the torch to find out (well, at least I wouldn\'t), but as
soon as you remove the torch from the tile, it returns to a near ambient
temperature extremely fast - thats what the ablative tiles *do*.  They
radiate waste heat by losing the hot \'bits\' - radiation, conduction and
convection are smaller parts of the process.

I saw a video similar to that at school (could have been the same video for
all I know), back when challenger blew up in 1986 (I think).  The scientist
picks up the tile with his fingers near the middle of the tile, scant
seconds after it has had a torch on it.  The tile reverted from incandescent
(visually) to dull in those few seconds.  I spent the rest of the day
daydreaming about space travel, and how we\'d be zipping around in
spacecopters within a few years :(

However, that doesn\'t solve our missile problem.  What about heating a heat
pump to heat up something in the core *really* hot (steam-turbine driving
the heat pump) while keeping the outside cold?  I\'m sure there is a law of
diminishing returns in here somewhere though...

The Ernest Lord Rutherford is often mentioned as one of the first three
Terran interstellar probes (the other two being the Micheal Collins
[Starleaper I] and the Yuri Gagarin). However, in reality there was very
little similarity between her and her contemparies. Whereas the Collins and
the Gargarin were mannned probes, the Rutherford was a fully fledged
Exploration ship. More than ten times the displacement of either the Collins
or the Gagarin, the Rutherford was capable of conducting a complete system
survey. While the Rutherford was begun almost a year before either the
Collins or Gagarin, both her size and the detailed preparations made for her
mission ment she was not ready to jump before the Starleaper I mission
returned to Terra.

Unlike the Collins and Gargarin, she was intended to complete her mission
without resorting to deep space refueling and carried sufficent fuel for four
consecutive jumps. Her life-support systems were completely self contained
(including gardens) and as a result, her endurance was only restricted by the
pyschological limitations of her crew. She was fitted with extensive sensors
for survey, along with a complete set of backups in case of failure and low
berths for the entire crew in the event of disaster.

With the return of the Starleaper I mission, the Rutherford\'s original
mission to Alpha Centuari was abandoned in favour of a \'grand tour\' of the
nearby systems to establish the extent of the Ziru Sirka and to locate
potential new colonies. Many latter commentators tend to lose sight of the
fact that at this stage, the latter mission was driven more by Earth-bound
rivalries than any fear of the Vilani. The Rutherford returned from her first
mission in 2097 AD, after having surveyed Prometheus, Perspera, Midway, and
Junction. The Western League shared the results of this voyage with the ESA
in return for access to the Europa Deep Space Base. This was an important
foundation in the establishment of European/Oceanian dominance on Earth in
the years leading up to the establishment of the Terran Confederation.

Tragically the Rutherford never compeleted her second voyage. In 2098 AD she
left Junction enroute to Fenris and was never seen again.

Yeah. One of my lobbying efforts is to get a minimum length on Meson Guns
of 60 meters at TL11, reducing by 10 meters per TL thereafter.

This way, they can stay in space and underground, where they belong, and
not provide a counter-battery proof battlefield artillery that people can
use to skeet-shoot grav tanks.

I\'d prefer them rebuilt to FFS2 standards, but yeah I think they are valid.

What I\'d like is a percentage-based High-Guard type system, and a modular
QSDS/SSDS system, both with components based on FFS2.

I\'ve got fragments of the High Guard system built ... it may or may not see
the light of day soon.

I played in a Traveller LARP.  It was at a convention and everyone got
secret assignments in one room and then sent down to the pool area. The
pool  area was like a lounge while we waited for a ship to arrive. A
friend of mine and I were running our own scam to sell plans for a jump-6
drive.  It had nothing to do with our assigned mission though.

was my characters uncle was the head of one of the most powerful "houses".
After giving my name I excepted his challenge. He actually got scared at
that point. He contacted me several times after the con, trying to get out
of the dual. After some time, I agreed that he could make a public apology
to me, to her and to my house. It would have been great... but he never
showed up and I never heard from him again.

Bringing this thread back to casino\'s and such. The merchant princess that I
was guarding had set up a travelling casino. We had all kinds of tables set

didn\'t use real money and we used a computer for the roulette wheel.

During an assembly in 1980 or 81, when I was living on Eastern Shore of
Maryland, we had a NASA scientist discuss the Shuttle and how it worked.
At the begining of the assembly he ignited a plumbers blowtorch and set it
in a cradle so that the flame would wash over the tile.  Near the end of
his spiel, over an hour later, he turned off the torch, waited a moment or
two, and then to the disbelief of all who were watching, picked up the tile
with his bare hand.  His explanation was that the tile needed a lot of
energy to heat, and shed it just as quick.

Oh, great.  I really hope they put it on at a time that will allow them to
get decent ratings!  Ten or eleven at night is not the best time to run a

Actually, to be totally realistic, they won\'t work worth a damn through
atmosphere at all, because unfortunately unless air is perfectly clear a laser
going through air will start heating up the air -- and a laser intense enough
to burn through significant amounts of steel in a short time (flash duration
sufficiently low that the 1 cm beam doesn\'t drift more than its own width when
shooting an evading target, so .04 seconds or less) will flash-heat atmosphere
to plasma, which is opaque; even a lower energy laser will cause enough heating
of air to change its index of refraction, which will diffuse the beam...  As
such, you can assume that a 1cm width beam probably just won\'t penetrate
atmosphere if its discharge energy is over a few hundred kilojoules.  This is
actually also a legitimate worry for the ability to penetrate armor -- these
high energy lasers will turn steel to plasma, which will then absorb quite a
bit of energy itself.

Note that you can resolve many of these problems by using a more realistic
laser technology -- if you simply use a wide area focus (one square meter or
more) and collapse the beam duration down to microseconds you can get a beam
through atmosphere, and flash heating on the surface will cause shockwaves in
the surface of the material, which will actually do a reasonable job of
damaging the target.

Artillery?  Bah, just use them as direct fire weapons.  This was a problem with
designing vehicles for GT: Star Mercs, which resulted in rules changes for
meson weapons in GT -- you could reasonably afford to put a meson gun on every
truck, and suddenly armor was obsolete.

I did something similar. I designed a battlerider tender with no internal jump

mounted in the rider bays. You can swap bays for riders (the tanks are the

 Two requirements to be "valid" in my opinion:

 -use the most current (and presumably most correct) versions, both available
online.
 -make sure the ship description lets the reader know which rules were used.
For example: "Happy Fun Ball-13 (QSDS 1.5)"

 As long as these things are kept in mind, any of the design systems related
to Traveller are "valid."  Usefullness to all people is a hedgehog of another
color...

True.  I see them as either siting in the open with enough firpower to toash
anything they see or hiding and waiting for their shot them moving to
another prepared position like a sniper team.  Their CG is shut down most of
the time.  Perhaps they use surface effect instead to cut their signature.

Go chemical pumped (copper matrix chemical plazma) and non fusion power
systems or put you $$$s into shielding  IE: Hammerslammers  Then the tank\'s
main gun can open a space ship the space ships say back.  If the space ship
has tank level armor it will have little else.

Not posible.  RF make a very mushy point source.  Harm Missles yes as they
can corrrect as they close but RF is to defused a signal for long range
direct fire with pin point accurracy.  All it would take is a little
atmosphere interference or skip a you get nothing but air.  You need am

Lasers can be countered by arisols and ablative armor.  I think in the end
energy weapons will have to go tward very high output and short duration.
In effect HE energy \'shells\'.  Plazma/fussion guns most likely.  Lasers are
going to have a lot of trouble with real armor. (Heat dispersion.)  You\'ll
need the penetration/punch of an hypersonic ice pick with the stoping power
of HE.  Lasers are just not the best for this.  We may still be using direct
fire shells for a long time to take out heavy armor.

Check the rampart.  It does not have that kind of armor in CT.  And exactly
what is a G of armor?  Is that grams per square centimeter?  If so even
assuming colpsed tank armor steal double DR rampart go BOOM when the
sidewinder hits!  Shaped charge!

IF it\'s sensors can target the fighter.  That\'s a big if.  Space and the
atmosphere are very different.  Why do you think they have to design
different systems to look at earth and the stars from orbit?

And the fighter is the target for anything on 1/8 of the planet.  You can
implace a lot of laser cannons on that much surface area.

Well actually I have said several times that I ment a TL15 atmospheric
fighter against a TL15 space fighter in the atmosphere.  I do not think a
space fighter would last long agaist an equal tech level atmospherice
fighter in the atmosphere.

Huricanes and tornados total MBTs and neither of those have hypersonic wind
speeds.  As for armor getting better, yes it will but only in the aspect of
bulkyness not mass.  Armor works because of mass density.  Dense armor means
less volume more weight.  You\'ll reach limits of design where you can not
move your armor.  1 ton of colapsed steel still weighs 1 ton even at half
it\'s volume and 1 ton of steel with take only so many MJs to melt
regardless.  Colapsing with probably act like suface hardening and give
better protection against impact but I dought it will change the melting
point of and element greatly.  This could make titainium a very sought after
material.  Light strong and heat resistant to start with and when colapsed...

I think that factor 2 is low.  Most modern fighter bombers can carry a lot
of ordence.  6+ missles at the low end.  For some 24 would not be out of
line.  I\'m not sure about pylon and control limitations but weight would
alow thier carrage.  IIRC I saw one the the large carrier fighters armed
with 4 pylons of 3 missles and 2 single mounts on the wing tips.  WW2 is my
prefered era of military history so modern aircraft are not my area of
knowledge.  I wish I had my reference books with me at work right now!  All
I have with me is my PBY book.  It could carry 3000 lbs of ordinence (2
torpedos!) and it was a WW2 reconocence plane.

7000 displacement tons?  That is almost 2 turrets worth.  The BB would have
to go with say 3 type Ms then.  Or 1 type T replacing it\'s forward turrets
and a type K for the rear turret.

>plant and fuel gives 9,400std or about 130,000m3.

8000 tons fuel and fresh water for the boilers.  Boiler weight is not in my
book.

2 million gallons of fuel oil alone. (200,000m3 approximately)

10 inch armor belt.  Can not easily convert the others.  Maybe they would

I was saying main armament replaced with main armament but OK.


The USS North Carolia (BB55) "The ShowBoat".  (Have spec book in hand)

728 feet long.
108 feet Beam.
35 feet draft.

Crew 2,2339 (144 officers/2,195enlisted)

Displacement over 40,000 tons!  (Ship displacement has a different meaning
than Traveller displacement.)

She carries 3 main turrents that weigh 1,400 tons each (turret only not
support equipment).

Each turret had three 16 inch guns 72 feet long.

They fires a shell weighing 2700 pounds.

She has 16 5 inch 38 dual mount turrets. (32 guns)

60 40mm in quad mounts.

36 20mms in single and dual mounts.

3 Kingfisher scout planes.


Now some Guestimates.  The above numbers for size deals with the waterline.
More than half the ship is above the water so the aproximate volume is
around 800000+ cubic meters. (I\'ve been aboard her it\'s probably a lot more.)

If you replace her main turrents with mason guns each would weight in at
about 3,500 tons if you replaces pound for pound. (Shell weight, powder
magazine, turrets, machinery, ect.)

The US alone had a dozen ships her equal in WW2.  Great Briton, and Japan
about as many.  Germany had 2 that I know of, Russia about 12 (equivalent)
at their best.  So say 50.  If you add 10 more for everybody else that\'s 60.
This does not count cruisers or aircraft carriers.

60 naval ships with 180 mason guns each weighing 3,500 tons.  That\'s a lot
of firepower!  Even if it were just 60 type Ts it would be bad!

Somebody cut out that part and I assumed and stated that the fight was in

One real fighter can launch many real missles.  One CT traveller rampart can
fire it\'s laser only once.  I play CT and GT.  I have never seen rule to

True, but that is NOT a space fighter.  It\'s an aerospace fighter.  Not the
same thing.  But even then and aerospace fighter has to waste space that on
a atmospheric fighter can be use for other things.  Take two identically
designed aerospace fighters.  Remove from one all the space only systems and
replace them with systems useful in the atmosphere.  Now which of the two
will be more survivable in the atmosphere?  At the least add extra armor or
decoys.

Any why would you put systems in a craft you could not use?  Air and space
are different enviroment.  A pure space ship would not mount sensor only
really usefull in the atmosphere.  Why would a space fighter waste space and
money on a tropostatic scatter array?  It can not be used in space.

And line of sight.  With the right gear the atmosic fighter can fire from
beyond LOS and still kill the space fighter.  Range is useless with a laser
if you do not have LOS.

Yes, that true also.  Performance is definately a situational word.  A high

Sorry but she\'s one of a kind in more ways than one.  Makes gift giving easy
though.  She like flowers, old silver jewlery(Siamese mostly), and....GAME
STUFF! in that order.  She\'s buried me the game and hobby stuff lately.  I
made the mistake of telling her I use to do scale modeling and she\'s gotten
me every SF space ship she could find.  She is currently serching for a
scale model of a cannoe and a English reverse trike car made some years ago.
Things used by various of her characters.  The canoe by a medevil
trapper/mage and the car by a modern horror mage/spirit talker.  The car was
inhabited by the spirit of Barron von Ricktoffein (spelling?).  You know,
"the bloody Red Barron of Germany."  Let\'s hope nobody discovers where those
missing Lewis guns went...

One of her chracters is a CT scout.  Do any of you have any ideas about
converting a Star Wars \'star destroyer\' into a large scale traveller scout
ship?  How about replacing the \'command bridge\' with a battle ships triple
turret or a modified tank turret?  Are there any good detail shots of the
turret or the landing gear articulation?  Would love to surprise her.

That\'s a problem then.  I play only CT and GT.  I dod not have a set of the

Not according to the TNT B5 web site.  Crusade premiers in June--of course, you
may mean that there will be no other Crusade shows after the first fifteen or so.

Open Frame Hull  [a simplification of a proposal I made earlier]:

An "open frame" starship would consist of an open frame hull and a number
of pressurized sections -- probably minimum 2 (bridge/crew and
engineering), up to as many as desired.

Choose your hull normally, from the table on p. GT151. Multiply surface
area by 0.001 at TL10, or 0.0004 at TL12; this gives the mass of the DR 100
open frame armor. Calculate cost per p. GT152. 

Select pressurized sections, also from the hull table. Do not use weight or
cost from the table. Instead, using the surface areas given, armor and seal
each section separately. Vehicle bays and cargo hold modules do not have to
be pressurized; all others must be included in a pressurized section.

[This puts open frame over the pressurized sections, but is the simplest
way to look at it. In keeping with High Guard the pressurized sections
should be limited to DR 100 as well, but VE2 does not require it.]

Alternatively, asteroid DR = (armor weight in stons x 2,857)/surface area.

Well, missiles dont have a 6G limit. They do have a limit, but it\'s
higher
than 6 gees.

You can do a fairly neat small x-ray laser, but basically, yeah,
missiles
are very much a secondary weapon system, suitable for use by and

We don\'t have to mess with thermodynamics at all.  It is perfectly
acceptable to have a heat sink internally that you can dump excess heat
into.  This only works until the heat sink is at the same temperature as
whatever it is being the sink for of course.  So we have a perfectly
acceptable thermodynamic reason for LHyd in our missile design.  This
would not need to be anywhere near infinite in capacity, since all you
would need to worry about is a few 20 or 30 minute turns before the
missile would go into terminal/active guidance and be visible as an
emitter.

Just to set my own record straight, the type of fusion was not "inertial
confinement" in the sense that it is not placed in that category of fusion
science.  I couldn\'t get a straight (i.e.layman\'s) answer out of my sources
here as to what kind of fusion it was, given the choices, but I found out

I\'m not sure how closely Jay watches the list, so I\'ll venture a bit.
The store will be opening in O\'Fallon, Illinois in mid-May.  An
invitation to the grand opening will be sent to all, but it\'s a bit too
soon yet, as he doesn\'t get the key to the store site until Wednesday.
He\'s been bouncing around some website ideas, too.  Maybe now would be a
good time to hear from the online community about what they would like
the website of their FLGS to have for them.  Hey, maybe there are some
ideas around for T-shirt designs, too?  Guys like Jay who are living
what many of us would consider a dream, still need practical help with
the basics.  It\'s hard to guess what customers want sometimes.  How
would you do it?

Actually, I\'ve found that the MET ( White Wolf\'s Minds Eye Theatre ) basic
mechanics can be applied to just about _any_ genre of game.

Just replace the Traveller stats and skills where Vtm has traits and such to
get the right feel.

The majority of the work in a LARP is providing the background materiel for
players to understand the culture and the character descriptions to get in
character, with Traveller that\'s pretty easy, as almost everyone knows
something about it or can generalize from Star Wars or other SF with
"Empires".

It doesn\'t really matter if they get the wrong idea aout the Imperium from
Star Wars, because there _are_ people in the Traveller universe that consider
the Imperium to be the big nasty, and any conflict is interesting in the plot.

Last major one I was involved with was a set-up for a table-top sci-fi game.
We played the various members and technical advisors to the UN Space Council
as we tried to decide who got sent on the First Contact mission.

Wolf Technologies, a private corporation that effectively controlled much of
Mars and had the only "jump" drive had discovered what was basically a probe,
and determined where it was transmitting to. And that was basically all we
knew about the aliens, though there were suspicions that Wolf wasn;t telling
us everything.

Some of us were realists and considered military capability a must, others
thought that was a bad thing to show on our first contact, and of course every
politico-cultural group wanted their own man / woman in the top job and at the
very least a representative on the team.

We were given briefings on the possible team members, none of whom were at the
meeting,  the area reps had full dossiers on their people, but could choose to
"edit" the truth if they felt a particular fact didn\'t help their candidate\'s
chances. At the end we all voted on the members of the team.

It was a lot of fun, and most of the evening was spent in political
maneuvering. Though I still remember the USAAF astronaut  (an "advisor" ) very
seriously telling me about the Roswell "incident" and how they might be in
trouble if the aliens found out about the autopsy.

Yep, she was mine.  Both of \'em - kinda\' funny as one of the two shots
wasn\'t going to be used originally, which is why I\'d made the second one.
On page 23 is the second version that I\'d done at Loren\'s request.  On page
91 is the original version.  That original version was also one of the shots
with motion blur on the ship in the background, and Loren and Steve had said
they didn\'t like \'em like that.  Go figure, but I\'m certainly not
complaining!  :)   I\'m not sure if a color copy of either shot exists, but
I\'ll check at home.  If yes, then I\'ll post a version on my site that
doesn\'t conflict with SJG copyright.  Just as an FYI, all of the CG shots in
there (35 of \'em I think...) were mine with the exception of that starfield
filler shot that\'s been around since the first G:T book.

I\'m looking at doing a Java-based ship design suite partially to brush up my
Java skills for an upcoming project at work, but also because I want a ship
design system that lets you create deck-plans from stock components ( such as
the pieces in the Naval Architects manual ) and print them out

I have no idea if I\'ll _ever_ get that far, my character generator began in
text mode on a TRS-80 and I still haven\'t finished it !

I\'d like to be able to write a system that determined the parameters of the
design sequence from an XML description of the system, allowing the same
general interface to be used for a ship design sequence, a small vehicle
design sequence or a character generatorm, with any really specific and techie
UI bits being able to be drawn in on the fly as Java Beans

I suspect that with this sort of architecture one could support FF&S,
QSDS/SSDS, Striker, High Guard, and possibly other rules system withiin the
same program.

I have all these dreams of "Ship Design Wizards" a la MS Office as well.

I\'ll probably die first, but assuming one wrote, say, a FFS2 sequence, does
anyone see a need to be able to choose whether errata were applied or not ?

40G is a MegaTraveller term for a hull with an armor value of 40 made of
material code G (bonded superdense, IIRC). It is the equivalent to 33 cm of
hard steel.

Sidewinders do not have shaped charge warheads. AIM-9 Sidewinder, for
example, has a proximity-fused conventional blast fragmentation warhead
weighing 20.8 pounds (9.36 kg). In fact, AFAIK no AAM has a shaped-charge
warhead, since their targets (other aircraft) are not armored.

The emphasis of my point is above.  While I could be easily persuaded to
concede that the TNE/FF&S laser performance is "too generous" (especially w/
thousands of km in a dense atmosphere), I would need specifics on the effects
of clouds, etc, especially given what we know Traveller lasers are capable of
(most prominently, burning through a bonded superdense hull hundreds of
thousands of kilometers distant in vacuum, as well as some role in orbital
bombardment and planetbound useage).  What is a couple hundred km of
atmosphere, much less mere meters of a cloud, compared to that?

What would you think is reasonable for a "clear dense atmosphere",cloudy dense
atmosphere, clear standard atmosphere, cloudy dense atmosphere,etc?
Specifically for a TL-12 100-Mj laser.  If it has a maximum effective range
(in FF&S/TNE) of 324,000 km in a vacuum, how much should a cloud dissipate it?
Obviously this should have something to do with the dimensions and exact
composition of the cloud in question.  A storm cloud will have a different
effect than an "ordinary fluffly" one, no?  How much should a cloud have an
effect over the "normal" effects of a standard atmosphere?  

If I did 3G3 right (never tried before now) merely requires the laser to have
a minimum diameter of 449mm, when in an atmosphere, which is a dwarf compared
to the 3.6 meter focal array I put on the ad hoc FF&S/TNE one, ignoring grav
focusing.  About an 8th of it actually.   I get a range in the 10s of km (RC 5
to 6).

Some GURPS Gearhead wanna tell what GV2 lasers are capable of?  Anything for
clouds in there?

I\'m ignoring that I could possibly maneuver to where the cloud isn\'t an
obstacle (possibly with assistance to "corner" the target) and Traveller
lasers have been portrayed as having a usage in planetary combat, even in
AFVs.  On a clear day, there definately shouldn\'t be a problem...

> plasma weapons are more common than lasers for atmosphere craft/grav
> tanks...

Yup.  High energy weapons do seem the most prominent, especially in grav AFV\'s
(though lasers make appearances in the armaments of these,too), despite the
extreme effectiveness of CPRs (and the ETC subset) and MDs using advanced
materials for KE weaponry (APFSDSCI,SD,BSD,CBSD, etc etc) and the capabilities
of autoloaders at higher TL\'s.  I don\'t have a problem with any of this,
though.  There can be numerous rationalizations/handwaves for that.  With the
TL caps (amongst others) for lasers, it becomes more desirable to use high
energy energy weapons, at least for the primary armament.

You can put an airframe on a space fighter and still have a \'space fighter,\'
just like you can airframe a free trader or scout ship.  The Rampart *is* an
airframed space fighter.  Airframe allows higher atmospheric speeds and
maneuvering.  The cost in the design is easily justified if you want a space
fighter that can double as an interface/air support platform.  This appears to
be what the Rampart is, as it\'s referenced on Imperial TOEs (in Striker II) in
a ground support role.

If they\'re being put in, they\'re going to be used.  They\'ll be used in an
interface/ground support craft.  All of the above can be used in space, as
well.  Should be usable anywhere.  Why would u want them?  The EW game should
be vitally important for far future combat.  The NAS is the least required and
has limited application.

I\'ll see them from many km off w/ my AEMS and easily pick them off w/ my
laser.  And in case, you missed the above, EMS covers everything "dirtside" I
need, though you could make a case that the avionics are required to make
sense of it in an atmosphere.

Regency Combat Vehicle Guide for TNE.  I\'ve never seen the poor integration of
Traveller high tech weapon systems, that you claim.  RCVG is at least one
example (Striker II another) where every kind of vehicle is there (support,
meson artillery, tanks, apcs, etc all grav).  From what I\'ve heard, Striker
would be another.

Actually, yes.  I\'m working (on and off - mostly off) on such a conversion.

Here\'s what I\'ve done so far:

I\'ve estimated the scale of that model at (IIRC) about 15mm scale.

Take everything off the hell (no engines, superstructure, etc) so you just
have the wedge left.

Turn it over - see that bubble bulge in the middle?  That\'s where I\'m
putting the turret.  I\'ve bashed a turret out of a table-tennis ball and a
couple of old GDW plastic marine\'s weapons.

Most of the rest is fairly simple.  Sheet styrene for the airlock and
air/raft hanger door.  I\'m building up too thrust plates out of thick wood
disks.  Landing gear might be a problem...I\'m thinking of scavenging them
from my old Millenium Falcon model.  Don\'t know yet.

More (maybe) to come...

Hmm. Your guestimate is off by at least factor of ten, unless I miss my
guess. If she displaces 40,000 tons of water, then she pretty much masses
40,000 tons. I\'m pretty sure that an armored battleship is going to have a
higher density than 1 ton per 20 cubic meters.

Lets look at it another way.

Using your numbers, let\'s pretend the North Carolina is a box 728 feet
(approximately 220 meters) long, 108 feet wide (33 meters or so), and 90
feet tall (2 x draft and then some, about  27 meters). This would give her
a volume of  (220 x 33 x 27) 196,020 cubic meters, or about 14,000
displacement tons in HG terms. About the size of a small Imperial escort
destroyer.

And she is not a box, so her volume is less than this.

Then the ships wouldn\'t be able to combat each other.
I think you are assuming different things. A pure space ship is 
unstreamlined and cannot enter the atmosphere so it can\'t fight the 
aeroplane except from orbit. A USL fighter would of course not have 
atmospheric sensor. The current discussion is pretty futile.

<SNIP of many kb of such futile discussion>

A more interesting discusion would be a pure atmospheric fighter
vs a multirole space fighter. The atmospheric fighter would have an
edge but how large (thin?) would it be? My SWAG would be that the
aeroplane is not _that_ much better (probably cheaper and smaller 
though).
 
I think there are several examples of atmosphere capable fighters in one 
of the THUDDD:s.

Not cancelled as such - placed in a holding pattern awaiting ratings IIRC.
Bear in mind Crusade has not had a pilot and they probably had a limit to
the investment they wanted to make before they continued.

There\'s a note at www the station.com (not sure exact spelling) from JMS on
the topic. Apparently TNT told them not to destroy the sets, as it seemed
likely it would be back.

In the UK there was a cut version at 10am on Sunday in kids show, and the
full version (unadvertised) after 12 midnight some weeks later.

Not good.

40 - minimum armour on a space going vessel
G is type of armour. eg superdense.

Someone here can probably translate the 40 into something more meaningful.

And collapsed superdense on the Rampart is designed to take micrometeorites
as a minimum, plus provide harden rad shielding from flares. I suspect that
most usual starship armour will shrug off the equivalent to a sidewinder
shaped charge.

Because the earth is illuminated by a large fusion reactor so a great
source of reflected light, whereas the stars are point sources of emmitted
radiation? :-)

I\'m assuming you\'re talking about weather effects here, not the Hawker and
Panavia aircraft.

Maybe so, but I have never come across an example of a 65 Tonne MBT being
thrown around by a hurricane. However, I don\'t live in a region where I get
that kind of news. I don\'t actually see what you are postualting and how it
links back to the original text. Hurricanes will do damage by throwing
around a vehicle as a unit, not by bursting a hole into the body and
exploding it.

> As for armor getting better, yes it will but only in the aspect of

Nope. Less volume same weight. Conversely, my cm of superdense is
significantly stronger than your cm steel because (1) there is more
material and (2) the bonds are manipulated to strengthen or align the
material - hence bonded superdense.

But playing with the bonds and material structure enhances the material
beyond a straight dimensional compression.

Whereas I believe playing with the atomic structure of the material is
likely to significantly alter the melting point, elasticity, and hardness,
not to mention the heat transfer ability.

Do you sell titanium? ;-)

Maybe, but from the references I\'ve seen for Traveller I\'d take the
superdense. It\'s significantly better, even at the same thickness.

a Traveller displacement ton is the volume occupied by 1 ton of liquid
hydrogen. It is a *volume* not a mass. It is not comparable to the IOWA\'s
displacement, which IIRC refers to the tons of water displaced, which is a
mass. The densities are different.

728 feet (converting approximately to metres by dividing by 3) = 242m
108 feet = 36m
35 feet = 12m

Say this equates to a rectangle 242 x 36 x 12 = 104544 m3

14m3 = 1dt

so your ship displaces 7467 dt in Traveller terms. You can only just fit a
type T in the shell of the ship.

Say we double the beam and assume that you ship has as much volume above
the water line as below =

we still only have 210,000 m3. Your 800000m3 assume 7/8 of the ships volume
is above the water.  800,000m3 is 58kdt equivalent.

Frankly, I disbelieve that much of the volume is above the waterline this.

To power a TL15 Type T requires 1200 dt of power plant at TL15. We still
have no hull, no bridge, accomodation, fuel, drives or armour. I leave it
for you to calculate the minimum size required just to service a single
Type T (50 weapons crew = 100 dt of staterooms, plus the PP crew (12 more
crew).

It\'s just HEPlaR is a \'better\' handwave.  ;-)  lol.  No violations of any
fundamental laws and you got to keep track of your gas.  Course, if you did it
with the ridiculous pre-FF&S power plants, you should be able to handle it.  I
can buy some of the T-plate arguments (after all, IMTU they come in at TL-17),
but they just seem weak compared to HEPlaR.  It\'s a personal preferance thing,
though the claim that HEPlaR is flawed is quite debatable, though.  

As far as using a plasma focus as a weapon?  I dunno... from the descriptions
I would doubt it.  There is a fusion reaction taking place, but outside of the
"ignition chamber," supplying the extra energy.  The upper limit IIRC is
supposed to be around 1/3 c.  Lasers, PAWs and MGs would still have the upper
hand.  Maybe for close range (inside 1 BL/BR hex) or fighters or something.
Back to HG1 drive attacks, possibly.  ;-)

Rather than coming up with a new theory and then coming up
with a number of reasons why it can\'t do what one would expect
I would just not have them in first place.

New gimics are fun at first.  Then you become used to them.
But any problems they may have continue to permeate through
a setting.

If I follow what you are saying, you are talking about "demountable"
tanks.  You strap them on and jump with a higher displacement.
When you get to your destination, you pop them off and use your
remaining fuel to jump at a lower displacement.

Also, before people start going off on this...player character
generation in no way is supposed to be indicative of the general
population of the OTU. Remember Travellers are those rare people who go
jaunting about the universe having adventures, instead of the 99.99% of
the rest of the people who have an 8-5er in their home city on their
home planet. That makes barons at .0003% (more or less) of the
population.

Given the what, 20 trillion population of the Imperium, there are still
waaay too many barons, though...something like 4 million or so...

Actually, no.

The Battlefield Meson Gun in Striker is TL15, and a very big mother.

Striker II ? I dont know.

The problem is battlefield meson guns at TL11 combine with the zero-delay
Inderect Fire Control Centers and Map Boxes, and you give a forward
observer instant ability to call down fire instantly to any point.

I dont have a problem with this being bleeding-edge TL15, but we are
talking about a set of technologies that is a thousand years old by the end
of the Third Imperium.

Ditzammer Spofulam is the Vice-President of the High Energy Solutions

She is very young, very smart, and only kept sane by huge quantities of

Her designs tend to push the envelope of high-energy solutions.

Recent designs include the Rappoteur 4 million joule man-poertable emplaced
plasma bazooka, the Signature class laser (one shot per 2.5 seconds at 250
or 600 megajoules, fits into a 3 or 6 dton standard turret) and \'Ditzie\'s
Little Helper\', a 140mm Gauss Gun that propels 30 kg slugs at 4 km/second.

Dont land without an adequate planetary bombardment. The other option is to
have a disposable ablative shell (with many decoys) ... the ship comes in
at some velocity, spews out a number of these shells. Once you are deep in
the atmosphere you touch off the solid rockets to kill your velocity and
get to NOE *fast*.

Yep. In FFS2, the damage formula for a fusion gun is 40* sqrt(Output), as
compared to 3.6 * sqrt(Output) for lasers and 7.2 * sqrt (Output) for PAWs.

Clearly, fusion guns rule the atmosphere.

Not true actually. You can build damn thick armour with the amount of

At TL7-8, maybe. As TLs go up, it gets better, especially if you can

CT has Striker as the ground combat module. It improves that aspect a lot.

Not once plasma guns come along. They can put out seriously scary amounts
of damage at moderate ranges, and dont have the problems solid shots do
with point defense weapons.

Emplaced anything on the surface gets mesoned to death from multiple light

Charles, one of the most basic things about Traveller is a displacement ton
is 14 cubic meters. It is not a metric ton.

In any case it gets seen and fried from multiple light seconds.

800 000 m3 is approximatly 50 000 dtons. She\'s about the size of a Light
Cruiser.

Not if they cant dodge. And they cant ... at least not fast enough to make
a difference.

>Air frame should provide spave not reduce it.  Wings give you space.

Charles, the way \'volume\' works in Traveller is your maximum dimensions,
not your internal volume. In any case, wings massivly add to your surface
area which in most cases is *bad*. 2mm of aluminium just doesnt cut it when
you can have lasers that can be dragged by the squad\'s motorbike.

The optimised aerospace fighter is in fact a grav tank. Low speed, heavy

I suppose that you could say that drop tanks prove your case, but I can also
see where they prove mine.  Admittedly, the only \'canon design I\'ve seen for
drop tanks is the Gazelle class, and they only *extend* the range, according
to \'Traders & Gunboats\', it has a standard J-4 (with tanks), J-5 when it
drops the tanks, and J-2 on internal tankage only.  So for the extended Jump
(where it is dropping the tanks), I would assume that it draws fuel from the
tanks first - stores that power in the newly-developed accumulators - drops
the tanks and switches to internal tanks.  By the time the accumulators
discharge and the plant supplies the power - the tanks are far enough away
not to interfere with the formation of the J-field.

About like the turret armor on the USS North Carolina.  Thick!  What\'s the

You are right of course.  Mixing thought again.  AT has shaped charge not AA.

Many of these capabilities are useless in the atmosphere.  Long wave radar
can not be used without a deploy antenea of the right length (100+ meters!)
Forget gamma rays, densometer, and Ladar.  Air is not a homogenious media.
Also there is the problem with training.  How much training time has the
space ace had flying in the atmosphere and using all those sensors?  I\'d say
he spent most of his time practicing space combat and what was left in
various atmospheres while the defender will know his world very well indeed.

Not true.  Space and atmospheric sensors that provide usefull data are very
different.  The design of radar systems are a science in and of itself.
Also look at the surface area of effective space sensors.  How are you going
to deploy them in an atmosphere without them being torn off?  You can\'t have
a 20 foot dish on a plane expected to travel 100s of MPH and perform high g
manuvers.  A little thing call wind load.

No, you will not because they will be terain following air breathers with a
radar aspect of a peanut and no efective heat signature running on passive
and homing on your active radar signal!  Can you say stealth!  When they
achieve LOS they detonate a bomb pumped or Duturium florine burning laser
and laser you without giving away the position of the launch vehicle some
where beyond the horizon.  Or they detonate a charge and fire a solid rod
Californium penatraiter with a time to target in the fractions of one second.


The atmosphere is NOT space.  You do not have a 4K background to compare to.
RAM, Thermal Cloaking, pop up attacks, over the horizon radar, target
seeking missles, and you space fighter with it\'s very hot radiaters to act
as a heat seeker magnet.  The problem you get is that in the atmosphere you
can not depend on visual/ir detection like you can in space.  IR is not
curtain in the atmosphere.  And sensor size is limited by drag.

I do not have any of these GT, and Gurps vehicles are my perfered systems.
With them you can build nearly any currently made Military gear.

Or, does bonded mean that the superdense is glazed and
chemically bonded to an inert substance?  (Think
galvanized steel.)  This would theoretically amount to
a ceramic skin on the armor and an improvement versus
thermal and chemical (acid) attack.  I think BSD is just
a minor improvement over superdense armor.  (No books
handy.)

Well, Steven is in fact correct. I was only on target with the issue
number. :-(

The article is "Striker Variant: "Foxhound"" from JTAS 14, pp 44-47,
written by J. D. Webster.

The plot is this: on a balkanised world, a large off-planet company is
attempting to arrange a trade deal. The dictator of one country is planning
to travel to the trade conference in a convoy of G-Carriers, escorted by
three starfighters provided by the off-world company. Another country wants
to block the trade deal, as it would give the dictator enough power to
conquer the entire planet. They have decided to use their advanced jet
fighters to shoot down the dictator\'s transport.

The strike group consists of 12 swing-wing twin-engined "Foxhound" jets,
each carrying 2 "Gyrfalcon" hypervelocity fire-and-forget starship missiles
(provided by a rival off-world company), 2 IR homing missiles, and a 2cm
autocannon. Appears to be based on the F-14.

The convoy consists of 8 ordinary G-Carriers each mounting twin LMGs in a
cupola.

The escorts are three Rampart-class star-fighters, each equipped with a
beam laser.

All start in high mode. The G-Carriers must stay together, and are used as
the centrepiece for range considerations. The jets and Ramparts can split
up. There are three ranges: close, long, and extreme (only available to the
Ramparts). Craft in the same range band can challenge each other to
dogfights.

Jets can fire the special missile at the G-Carriers if they are at long
range and unengaged. They can fire the missile at Ramparts not in the same
range band if they are not dogfighting. They can fire the missile at
Ramparts in the same range band provided neither is dogfighting. They can
only fire their IR missile at targets in high mode, and can only use their
autocannon if they win initiative against a challenging star-fighter OR if
strafing the G-Carriers.

G-Carriers can fire offensively if they win the advantage (unlikely),
otherwise it is only defensive fire.

A Rampart can fire at targets in the same range band that do not have an
advantage over them, or at targets in other range bands that are not
dogfighting, or at incoming missiles (when at extreme range only). They
cannot fire when moving from long to extreme range, as they are climbing
straight up.

As for damage, an IR missile (Pen 11) or cannon (Pen 15) will only do minor
(paint-scraping) damage to a star-fighter (AF 60). The special missile has
a Pen of 65 vs the Rampart\'s armour. The beam laser has a Pen of 75, with
_full_ effect against jets (rather than half as per Striker). This means
that each hit does 75 damage points. My assumption is that this rule is
used to show how much more deadly starship-grade weapons are than
atmospheric weapons (the

Full stats for the jet are given, plus a few for the Rampart. The jet h=

You are off in several areas but right also.  She is less wide at the
waterline as she is at main deck level and she is more like 120 meters tall
overall but you make a good point.  She is very heavy for her size.   I
messed up displacement in the exact opposite way I warned about in my own
post.  Sigh, anybody got a towel for this egg on my face?  I do not want to
think to much of something as massive as BB55 flying.  She is awesome
sitting in the water.

True, my goof has already been pointed out.  The NC could handle the mass
but not the volume of a Type T.  I\'m not sure the Nimitz could and still
have room for everything else.  Think of the stress involved in liftoff of
something this size!

More than twice as much above as below.  She\'s tall with a lot of freeboard.

There would be IF she was a rectangle.  This is more the volume of a
rectangle that could hold her.  She probably has about 1/3 to 1/4 this space
inclosed.  I blew the math in the wrong direection.  Scaled up instead of
down.  OOPPPsss!

My goof here too.  Sidewinder are not shaped charges.  You need an antitank

That\'s part of it.  The earth is a lot warmer than space also.

Good one.  Yes I ment wind effects and I ment that if 500 MPH tornado winds
can move a tank 780+MPH winds will peel a planed skin of if a breach ocures.

I dought melting point will change as it does not seem to be directly

You missunderstand.  Superdense what?  What was made superdense?  I was
saying titainium would be a go thing to make into a superdense material.
You have to start with some normal matter.  Some matters will be better than
others in making superdense.

	As I remember, his article hit JTAS 22 a few months after it was announced
in a Scientific Mag that a break-through using computers and Alpha wave
scanners had occurred IRL. A test subject fitted with a helmet stared at a
symbol and the alpha scanner helmet fed this info to a computer. Then
another symbol, etc etc. Then each symbol was linked to a computer program.
the subject was told that symbol A would mean turn on the lights. the
subject was told to "turn on the lights" the subject then concentrated on
symbol A and the Helmet detected the alpha pattern, computer program
connected to that symbol/pattern ran. 	The problem being each persons alpha
pattern was different for each symbol. Nothing has been heard of since
about that project (except a movie, Firefox with Clint Eastwood) So that
being said, My impression was that the article was accepted because it had
a basis in real life. 
	Another interesting IRL occurance is if you read the description of the
Battletech (FASA) Musculature motive system for the Battlemechs and then
read the description of the robotic muscles break-though being tested now...

	Does this mean that some scientists are former gamers? or that gamers
think ahead? Or some gamers are scientific calibre?... I can\'t wait for my
Type S Scout to hit the market. Can we preorder our force swords?

	And finally as a side note. With whats happening in Europe and the Y2K
event... is anyone ready to play Twilight 2000 For real? Look at the names
of where the fighting is taking place and then look at the names on your
Twi 2000 maps.

Jason asked:
>Now, that\'s an interesting comment.  How -would- one run a Traveller
>LARP?  Has it been done?

I played in a Traveller free-form at CANCON back in the late 80\'s or early
1990\'s (after MT and Digest #9 came out but before TNE, anyway!). We were
(mostly) playing nobles (and Aslan guard commanders, etc) aboard the
Imperial Palace after Lucan had succeeded in defeating Dulinor. His
daughter, Isis, was going to swear allegiance to Lucan during an audience
with him, but ended up shooting him and declaring herself Empress. The
session that developed from there was that the Moot had to decide whether
to ratify her claim.

There were a number of sub-plots, including raising the Marie Celeste that
was somehow in the "pond", preventing some lunatic from overloading the
fusion plant, chasing down some sort of alien critters that had been
released into the airducts, and so on. From memory, the Palace was boosted
into orbit with its black globe on until we came to a consensus - and I
can\'t even remember who ended up elected!

BTW, the black globe was turned on late in the game, and is known in gaming
terms as a "brick wall" - a badly-executed glass wall. If you are going to
run a "box" scenario (one in which the PC\'s cannot escape before the end of
the session), you need to have a plausible "box" that appears transparent.
That is, the PC\'s can continue to *hope* to escape the "box", even if they
really can\'t. The worst form is a "stone wall" (ie. the GM "stonewalls"
your efforts ;-).

Here is a reasonable checklist for creating a convention game (given that
you should spend more time on it than "normal" scenarios):

1.   Conceptual Playtest

     "I\'ve got this great idea for a module..."

2.   Devil\'s Advocate Meeting

     A conceptual playtest without an actual playtest.

3.   Alpha Test

     First rough test of the module.

4.   Beta Test

     Conceptually complete module, tested prior to the final write-up.

5.   Dry Run (GM run)

     Final playtest designed to familiarise GM\'s with the module under
     tournament conditions.

Note that, just like the Programming Life Cycle, it is a rare module that
goes through all stages... ;-) However, the more effort you put in, the
better the module. It helps to close up all the gaping truck-sized holes in
the plot that a 10-year-old can see thru... for example, having a
teleporter in "Missions of State" or FTL communications in JTAS 26!.

I rather like both the QSDS and SSDS, especially the cost reduction.  It
reflect the lower cost (in-game) of standardized components, and thus helps
to flesh out the world in the mechanics.

Yes, as I understand it. THey have stopped filming and STORED the sets,
rather than recycled/scrapped them. So there is always the hope that
high rating will put the show back on the schedule.Unfortunately the
crew and cast have been released and are seeking other jobs, so picking
the show up again at this point might not yeld the same product.

The problem seems to be an expensive product and luke warm market. Then
again this may be over "creative differences" and by letting the crew go
and re-hireing later, the network executives can tailor the creative
element to their taste. I\'ve seen this sort of thing happen in other
industries.

Maybe this is a question of semantics?? The Trav fighters I have seen in HG
or MT rules are all designated as airframe construction. I always believed
that small craft ARE optimised for an atmosphere, since that is where I
perceive them being used most of the time. They are interface craft. Look
at the "slow boat" in MT, for example. It may only have 2G, but since it is
airframed it travels at over 2000 kph in atmosphere, much faster than the
5G ship\'s boat which is only "streamlined".

I always view the sensors the same way; the craft are designed for
interface combat, so the sensors work just as well in atmosphere as in
space.

What you may like to check out is COACC, which has a (50-ton?) TL 15
fighter in the back. Now *that* may be a match for the original (8-ton?)
AHL Rampart - but check out the 50-ton Rampart IV\'s and V\'s from an early
Challenge (#27? #28?)!!

>>40G superdense, space meteorite resistance armour
>Check the rampart.  It does not have that kind of armor in CT.
>And exactly what is a G of armor?

"G" is the MT code for superdense armour (so the quoter was just being
redundant ;-). And I think you\'ll find that the Rampart *does* have good
armour, even in CT. High Guard armour factor-0 is AF 40 in CT personal
combat. This is the scale that rates cloth as AV 5, battledress as AF 18,
and FGMP-15\'s as Pen 34. HG armour factor 1 is personal combat AF 60, which
is what the Ramparts in "Foxhound" have.

The IR air-to-air aircraft missiles in that scenario only have Pen 11,
which is arguably very low. Anyone have a better aircraft missile drawn up?
What does COACC say (my books are at home)?

Sounds kinda like the Hellbore weapon from the Bolo books.  A sliver of
frozen deuterium, fusing, fired at .6-.7C...  The output is measured in
Megatons per second.... :)

My rule of thumb goes something like this:

Craft up to 6000 tons can land on landing gear, if airframes or
streamlined.
Craft up to 50,000 tons can land in water or highly-specialised cradles -
water is cheaper!
Craft up to 100,000 tons can enter low atmosphere but cannot land.
Dependign on the atmosphere, the GM might rule that this is very dangerous.
Anything bigger can only enter high atmosphere - for example they can
refuel at a GG.

[Natch, craft smaller than 50,000 tons can land on cradles,  eg. the Tukera
merchant from the early Digests (#4?) or in the water.]

This is why you need all those small interface craft - for transport!

Dunno about clouds, but in a standard earth atmosphere an x-ray laser has
1/100th it\'s vacuum range.  Since a 450MJ GTL12 Laser (on p:GT173) has a
maximum space range of 39 2000-mile hexes (78000miles), in an atmosphere,
that means it has an effective range of 780 miles in an atmosphere.  

Does anyone know how that compares with the distance to Horizon at say,
20000 feet?

Well, I don\'t have the charts to which you refer, so I\'ll make a couple
of suggestions.  Try these out, and see if you get answers closer to
what the charts indicate.

1.  Don\'t assume that a ship accelerates for the entire trip out. 
Generally speaking, a ship will accelerate for the first half of the
journey, and decelerate for the second half, thus entering jumpspace
with little or no relative velocity.  The reson for this is simple.  If
you enter jumpspace moving like a bat out of Hell, you reenter normal
space moving like a bat _into_ Hell.  Since you can\'t see ahead of time
what might be in your way, this is generally considered to be a _bad_
idea.  (Makes me feel like Tom Bodett in the Animaniacs cartoons\' "Good
Idea/Bad Idea" feature. ["Good Idea:  Entering jumpspace at a high
velocity {shows Mr. Skullhead piloting the Millenium Falcon into
lightspeed, just ahead of the TIE fighters}.  Bad Idea:  Re-entering
normal space at a high velocity {shows Mr. Skullhead slamming smack into
the side of the Death Star}.  The End."])

2.  The tables may have already compensated for the gravitational effect
of the celestial body in question.  Your calculations should do the
same.

3.  Without trying to reignite certain "discussions" on the TML, I would
point out that the 10/100 diameter limit could refer to the _stellar_
diameter, rather than the planetary diameter.  Try running those
numbers, and see what you get.

	One of the best games stores I\'ve ever seen is The Game Parlour in Chantilly
Virginia, it is really quite excellent, almost beyond words.  There is even a
review of the store on www.RPG.NET, search the review database.

	The best things about the store are as follows:
	1) Everything is arranged by theme rather than by company.  All the fantasy
stuff--rules, magazines, minatures is together, all the Sci-fi stuff is
together as well.  This makes finding what you want much easier .  it also
makes buying supporting material such as miniatures, mats, play-aids much more
tempting.
	2)  Game playing space provided:  there are over a dozen game tables and even
a separate role-play room all of which are availible for reservation.   I
can\'t tell you how much more money I\'ve spent since I go in there every two
weeks to run my game.  If you give people a place to play, they will want to
support you by buying their products from you rather than elsewhere, I know I
try to by everything at the Game Parlour, if possible.  They also make some
money selling packaged food like candy and sodas.
	3)  Gamers run the register:   it makes customers feel doubly welcome.


	best of luck to you, and if you ever get to DC go to the Game Parlour, it\'s
worth a look.  (It\'s not too far from Dulles Airport)

From FF&Sv2, page 63:

"Bonded Superdense:  Armor with internal electron bonds, further
strengthened by a small induced electrical current."

Sounds as if Bonded Superdense is an accurate name (since the "bonded"
refers to the strengthened electron bonds).

I agree totally.  I even tried to create one for Milieu 0, but I\'ve
misplaced it.
I realize that the canonicity of Milieu 0 is suspect to some, but FWIW,
from Milieu 0 (pp.46-47):

The Nobility
The Moot
The Bureacracy:
   The Military
      Army
      Navy
          Marines

          The Imperial Office of Justice (later Ministry of Justice)
   The Scout and Exploratory Services (later IISS)
   The Ministry of Information
   The Diplomatic Corps

Although discussed, the Bureau of Interstellar Affairs is not clearly
affiliated
with
any other named office.

Of course, if you want to watch your PCs _really_ squirm, throw the
equivalent of "Chiggie von Richtofen" (from "Space: Above and Beyond")
into the campaign.  A single experimental enemy fighter, of TL:
Higher-than-the-PCs\', slaughtering squadrons of friendly fighters all by
its lonesome....

This also works for larger ships (one enemy cruiser-sized ship wiping
out Batrons).

(Actual design would depend on TL of the milieu in question.)

I disagree with your conclusion, to this extent:

Vehicle design is similar to restaurant food:  "You can get food that\'s
good, cheap, and fast.  Pick two."  With vehicles, it\'s "You can have
vehicles that are fast, well-armed, and well-protected.  Pick two."

It seems likely that there will always be a mission requirement for
vehicles that achieve high speed, at the expense of weapons, protection,
or both.  Two examples would be reconnaissance vehicles (which need to
be faster than the vehicles they support) and "flying artillery" (such
as the Ju-87s used in Hitler\'s "blitzkrieg", or the close air support
available to Coalition forces in the 1991 Gulf War).

IIRC, helium (in one isotope or another) is the byproduct of
hydrogen-based fusion reactions (which isotope of helium, and how much,
depends on which isotopes of hydrogen are involved, in which fusion
reaction).

From what I recall reading, you can gain energy from fusion reactions
all the way up to Iron (similarly, you can gain energy from fission
reactions of elements heavier than Iron).  A fusion reactor designed for
optimal efficiency of reactive mass could do so, although I would
suspect that diminishing returns would discourage most of the
higher-level fusion reactions.  Helium, OTOH, would likely still provide
a sufficiently energetic fusion reaction to be worth exploiting (at
least at higher TLs).

I\'m not invoking any "new theories."  *Nothing* says every last drop of j-fuel
is consumed at the instant of jump, is there?  Drop tanks exist in every
version of Traveller.  They\'re not just going to go away.  Of course, they
don\'t have to apply to anyone\'s TU, but the only reason they give problems is
due to assumptions on the workings of J-drives, assumptions that don\'t seem
grounded in canon.

Nope.  According to my MT Ref\'s Manual, Dismountable tanks are "fixed and
semi- permament" and (the exterior ones) require two weeks to be dismounted.
Drop tanks are instant drop.  This is apparently, the only difference between
the two.
Just what do you think drop tanks are?  Are we talking bout the same thing?
How do drop tanks bust up YTU?  The economic thing Hans was talking bout (and
solved nicely if that\'s the only problem) or the issue of J-drive workings I\'m
talking bout (and is solved by correcting the theory behind J-drives)?

I\'m taking it there are no designs with drop tanks lacking internal tankage?
That is the only thing that would require "new theories" and should normally
be prohibited from the OTU rules IMO.

The only problems w/ drop tanks (aside from eventually sundering economic
assumptions), is the issue that is only a problem if you\'re the "instant
consumption" model of J-drive.

Duh.  We\'re told EMS sensors cover *everything* in between longwave radar and
gamma rays.  That includes longwave radio, shortwave radio, microwave radio,
heat/IR, visible light, UV, X-ray, Gamma.

Well unfortunately Traveller history is against you, as the usage of these
sensors (EMS, at least) in atmospheres is well documented (try every TL-10+
design) in both grav and space vehicles that have no problems operating in the
others environment.  We\'re talking bout a TL-15 Rampart here that has
holographic dymanic linked computers that can assist the user and is very
nearly AI by itself.  It\'s a no brainer.  The tech is the great equalizer.

Listen, Charles.  The space sensors (AEMS and PEMS, at least) are *everything*
that the atmospheric sensors are (at least when coupled with the atmospheric
flight avionics).  The differences you\'re focusing on are gone (or glossed
over) at TL-10 w/ the development of EMS sensors.  That\'s the basic and
underlying presumption.

There arent\' any 20 foot dishes on the Rampart (in BL anyways).  The Rampart
has a (60,000km short range) fixed apeture synthesis array of dispersed
elements that have a diameter that total 5m for its PEMS.  It\'s not just one
big Sony DSS on the nose cone.  lol.  *That\'s* certainly not in the artwork.
;-)

I trust u\'ve finally conceded that by TL-15, aerospace fighters are mostly
replaced by grav tanks?  Avionics & airframe make the space fighter an
aerospace fighter.

What else would you do but multiply the relevant diameter (in
kilometers) by 10 or 100? I don\'t have Imperial Encyclopedia here, so I
can\'t address the travel time charts.

One other factor to consider is solar diameter.  The idea of safe jump
distance is that your astrogation will be made inaccurate by strong
gravitational forces, so you get away from the gravity well of the
planet.  You should for the same reason also get away from the gravity
well of the system\'s star.  Thus you need to determine whether the world
is within 10 or 100 diameters of its sun when you are deciding safe jump
points.

IMTU, there is a system called Beck which is the recreation system
situated on a main with several rich hi-pop worlds within a few
jumps.  It is Las Vegas, Orlando, Cancun, Paris, Baden Baden, Monte
Carlo, Bangkok, and Hawaii rolled up into one for the subsector.
Everyone from families to newlyweds, gamblers to wealthy dilettantes
travel there for "holiday."

There are also a number of large liners that travel the Beck route
catering to these vacationers.  The liners are the equivalent of the
cruise ships *and* the luxury liners from early this century.

I\'m *sure* you could run a very interesting campaign either on a
liner or in the Beck system.  

On the liners the players could take on roles of crew (and not
necessarily senior crew).  Deal with thieves, hijackers, cheating
gamblers, a pack of pre-teens that decide to "have some fun" comes
to mind.  This wouldn\'t be your typical mercenary/merchant game, but
it could be interesting.

In the Beck system the choices for what they played would be *wide*
open!  Bar, cafe, lounge owners, workers, entertainers.  Law
enforcement agents.  Casino management or security.  All the folks
on the *Other* side.  You could campaign for years there, couldn\'t
you? ;->

Gamers are science fiction addicts. All of what you mention appeared in SF
_long_ before it appeared in a game or IRL. One of  SFs jobs is to try and
predict future tends.

They are not really related. T2000 is based on a full scale conventional war
with the Warsaw Pact as it was in the seventies, followed by a limited nuclear
excchange.  The only reason Yugoslavian names appear is that Yugoslavia was
one of the "border countries" of the Warsaw Pact, and is an obvious place for
fighting to occur.

IRL, the Warsaw Pact is basically non-existent, the Russian Confederation
would find itself hard pressed to mount an effective defence, let alone an
assault, and Germany has been re-united and is on NATO\'s side.

I\'m sorry, but this is patently ridiculous.

If, as you assume, you conserve your velocity when entering jump space, you
will never get to the destination you are aiming for, because the relative
velocity between your ship and the target system is going to be _huge_ , even
assuming that you have cancelled your velocity relative to your own system.

Near C rocks ?
Try a near C jump torpedo.

The only way for jump to work as advertised is for it to "automagically" match
your velocity with that of the target system on exit from J-space, in which
case your velocity on entry to jump is completely irrelevant.

At the risk of being off topic:

The Warsaw Pact was dissolved in, IIRC, 1990.  Since Poland joined NATO last
week, its obviously dead by now.  Note that Poland, Hungary, the Baltic
states, and what was then Czechoslovakia all petitioned NATO for "associate"
membership in 1991-92. While this was not given, there has been a tacit
assumption that NATO will look out for them if necessary (i.e, if Russia
became militaristic).  Note that Poland has been exercising with Germany and
the US.  Also, Germany is not only on NATO\'s side, but has been a member
since 1954.  Finally, given the level of defensive paranoia in the high
command of the Russian armed forces, the idea of invading the West to "save"
Serbia is laughable.  The Russian military has a very historical
perspective, and remembers quite well what happened last time they tried to
help their fellow Slavs- back in August, 1914.

ObTraveller:

Note how, of all the Imperium\'s many enemies, only those who were once a
part actually launched a full-scale invasion (the Solomani)?  Sadly, I
believe Yugoslavia is a very good example of what happens when the pin falls
out of the grenade.  Without loyalty to Tito, or any outside threat,
regions of Yugoslavia that haven\'t been independent in this Millenium are
suddenly restive.  Makes the Rebellion seem almost tame.

	There was a short discussion about the technology called as 
	"plasma focus" in TNE mailing list. It appears that this kind
	of technology might allow roughly similar results as "HEPlaR" 
	drive.

	In plasma focus experiments they are using high intensity lasers 
	or electron beams to induce microfusion (or other similar 
	reaction) in hydrogen plasma, and the resulting reaction 
	launches plasma sheath at 100-200 km/s velocity.

	If this kind of system could be as a basis for a space thruster, 
	it would mean that:

	1) System requires input energy for powering the lasers (or 
	   electron beams) and generating plasma.

	2) System uses hydrogen as fuel.	

	3) The reaction generates much energy, since the plasma pulse
	   is launched at much higher velocity than the input energy
	   would suggest.

	It appears that FF&S HEPlaR drive operates in a similar way.
	HEPlaR generates about 1980.2 times the thrust it should be
	generating, so there should be energy-producing reaction 
	somewhere.

	Therefore we might consider HEPlaR to be a kind of plasma focus 
	drive which achieves ~40361 km/s plasma velocity.

	This might be just an ugly handwave-explanation, but at least it 
	made me feel more comfortable with HEPlaR drives.

	Plasma focus might be a possible explanation for plasma and 
	fusion weapons. Since the reaction launches single pulse of 
	plasma at very high velocity, a plasma focus device could 
	probably be used as weapon.

	This kind of weapon might consist of:

	1) Plasma focus chamber which launches the plasma sheath.

	2) Magnetic lens (barrel) which concentrates the plasma into 
          narrow stream.

	3) Hydrogen fuel.

	4) Accumulator which gives a pulse of energy to plasma focus 
	   chamber.

	5) Power source.

	I haven\'t considered this kind of system as a space weapon. 
	Currently I use man-portable versions in my TNE campaign, and 
	call them with "PGMP-xx" or "FGMP-xx" -style names.

D6  roll of 1=(6 days in jump), 2 thru 5=(7 days in jump), and 6=(8 days in

For single ships this isn\'t a problem, but once you start trying to
coordinate two or more ships, things get interesting.  For any sizable
fleet, 17% of its ships will arrive in-system on day 6, 66% arrive on day 7,
and the remaining 17% will arrive on day 8.  (All % very approximate).  This
provides an interesting tactics problem, as the fleet will be divided for a
certain period of time, and a random mix of ships will be appearing out of
jump (over time).  Strategically, this means you would have to plan for
eight day movement cycles.

I assume that most game systems would ignore this little problem, but I\'d be
interested in hearing how it would be handled otherwise.  How would it
affect ship design?  Fleet composition?  Would commanders stagger their
jump-entries, in order to ensure that main-line battle elements arrived
first?  Would stealth become more of a priority, since ships might have to
spend 24-48 hours without support?

It seems like some interesting developments might occur...

  Average density of CT/HG ships appears to be 10-14 metric tons per cubic

  FWIW, that\'s small beans compared to the density of the IM APC on a Kinunir:

This is simply solved by saying that the relative velocity with respect to the
"local" gravity well (IMTU that would be the local sun) is conserved. So a ship
travelling away from the star at 30km/s and enters jump , when leaving jump it
will be travelling at 30km/s away from the target star.

"Superdense is *metal* which has had its molecular structure partially
collapsed in a massive artificial gravity field (such as might be
encounterd in a white dwarf star), which increases its density and
strength. Bonded superdense has had its electron bonds artificially
strengthened, by means of a field similar to that used in damper

Bonded only has the metal collapsed and the bonds manipulated. Coherent
Bonded Superdense has the entire molecular structure aligned to resist

Nope.

GT: AR1 covers the Zhodani quite well (as did the CT AM).
There is also a CT Droyne module, and a planned GT module.

See my post on superdense sent separately. Basically, FFS says \'metal\' so I

Heavy frame also multiplies the hull hit points by 2 (3x surface area),

What I understood from this is that the variance is a physical/astrometric
factor that is present in a "region" at the time. A fleet coordinating a
jump using the same or near same tech level jump system would have the
same astrometric variables affecting them.

The problem would be co-ordinating multiple fleets along multiple paths
trying to arrive at an objective at the same time. The variances in jump
time over multiple jumps would end up resulting in some interesting
problems, as one fleet would show up perhaps a couple days after the first
group.

<snip>

IMTU thrusters work the same way as a gondola in venice:
The gondolier pushes with his stick against the bottom thus using the
rest of the planet as reaction mass. As this effect upon earth might be
to small to be measured, this method might be described as being
reaction less.

Thrusters push against the structure of space-time, thus using the rest
of the universe as reaction mass. IMTU this causes some ripples in
space-time (small gravitational waves) which can be sensed by
densitometers.


Comparing thrusters to HEPlaR (FFS V1):

to generate 100 metric tonnes of thrust you need:

HEPlaR:
0.5 m3,  0.5 t,  5 MW,  0.005 MCr

Thrusters:
2.5 m3,  5 t,  2.5 MW,  2.5 MCr


the same IMTU at TL14:

HEPlaR:
0.5 m3,  0.5 t,  5 MW,  0.01 MCr

Thrusters:
1.6 m3,  4 t,  20 MW,  0.16 MCr


Speaking for MTU there is only one reason to use thrusters:
They do not consume fuel. In all other aspect the are (seriously)
inferior to HEPlaR, especially when you are in need of lots of thrust.


Just something for you to think about ...

Not the way you appear to define canon (the body of published adventures as
opposed to the rules). But not everybody are as willing to consider the
rules to be of secondary importance as you are. As you know, I for one think
the rules are even more important than the background (because a good,
self-consistent rules-set, if adhered to by writers, will ensure that the
background is also self-consistent).

Mind you, that dosen\'t mean I don\'t think the background is important.

Fair enough. But this is also a canon change.

Well, yes. The rules. You can take your Gazelle, initiate a jump that uses
all the drop tank fuel, drop the drop tanks, make the jump and arrive at your
destination with every last drop of your interior fuel intact.

>Drop tanks exist in every version of Traveller.

And they perform the same in every version.

>I\'m taking it there are no designs with drop tanks lacking internal tankage?

None published (IIRC), but there\'s an awful lot of TCS designs out there
that used to be legal and would not be if your change was adopted.

Even with your model you have J-2 worth of fuel being consumed instantly
(actually, in 20-40 minutes), so I don\'t quite see just how it solves
any problems with the instant consumption of J-4 worth of fuel. Reduce
them, perhaps, but how does it solve anything?

    'body' => 'The things one gets tangled in. I try and write a paragraph of variant
rules, I find myself writing pages. <G>

I was writing some variant HG rules for ambushes by SDB\'s during gas
gaint refueling operations, and realized that HG has no operational scale
movement rules. Ships are moved strategically (via Jump or long hauls
to or from the Outer System) and sort of moved tactically (line of battle
to and from the reserve), but there isn\'t any way to differentiate between
the fleet defending the gas giant and the fleet defending the main
world. We can\'t have that now, can we?

I\'m putting the touches on a first draft of operational-scale rules for HG.
Basically, the battle for a star system takes place in alternating movement 
phases and combat phases. The star system is divided into the Inner 
System, the Outer System, and System Defense Zones (SDZ\'s). The "Inner
System" is an abstraction representing transit times between points of
interest like worlds and gas giants, the Outer System is pretty much as
it is in TCS - it represents the safety of deep, deep space. Each SDZ
represents the area of space around a point of interest, such as a main
world, gas giant, etc.[1] 

In a movement phase, any ship can move from an SDZ to the Inner System.
Ships in the Inner System must move to either an SDZ or to the Outer
System, while ships in the Outer System are out of the fight until the
next TCS turn.

Note that all SDZ\'s are adjacent to the Inner System for movement
purposes, but not adjacent to each other[2] - if two points of interest are
that close together, these rules would place them both in the same
SDZ - for example, Luna is included in the Earth SDZ.

During each combat phase, ships within each SDZ fight just like HG
rules. Combat continues until one side is destroyed, surrenders, or
breaks off (must move to Inner System next movement phase). A standoff
can also occur, if no ships have been damaged for five HG combat rounds.

Rules for jumping in-system, operational movement by small craft, pursuit,
interception, and refueling are also included. And yes, rules for SDB\'s
pouncing on fuel-scooping starships in the depths of a gas giant are part of 
the mix. I should have it to the list by the end of the week.

What I\'d like to hear from the list:

Is an area/operational rules set for HG an interesting idea? Or does it add
such a level of complexity that we\'d be better off going straight to a hexes
board game?

What happens to an HG/TCS game when you have to defend two or three
gas giants as well as your main world? I think it will make HG strategic
games less bloody, as a careful enemy will be able to refuel and retreat
when hard pressed - or he\'ll be able to defeat your defense fleet piecemeal
as you try and defend all the refueling sources.

BTW, I\'m still working on my Fleet Tac variant for HG. These operational
scale rules should be entirely compatible with Fleet Tac.
"Fleet Tac" is my working title for the Imperium-inspired High Guard
combat rules involving match-ups and screening elements instead of
two fleet ramming all ships into each other.

Variants, variants, variants...Fighter Strike, Fleet Tac, Fleet Ops.
Not to mention Logistics and Area Point Defense/Escorts. I like HG,
it gives me ideas. <G>

Walt Smith

Notes
[1] My concept of SDZ is based on the idea that an invading fleet has
some objectives in mind - fuel, destruction of enemy bases, whatever.
If two fleets want to destroy each other, they could just mutually define
any empty chunk of space as the "All the Marbles SDZ" and send all their
ships there.

[2] One variant would be for a GM to lay out the star system and
define specific transit times between each SDZ. This would be fine,
but I think that level of detail would be better saved for a full-fledged
"Battle of Jewell" wargame...I\'d like to keep this simpler than that, while
still providing a feel for fighting an entire system rather than have every
fight for every system be one big battle all at once.

GDW did publish a Droyne book.  Alien module 5.

        I think it is a much better idea than hexes...  However, there is
one small issue that it develops.  Allow me to use an IMTU example.  In near
game future, the Bad Guys are going to attack a heavily defended colony
world.  Precendent says that they will genocide the colonists if they
succede in reaching the world.  All that is there is a small battlefleet and
a reasonably mean TL11 battlestation
.
        When you cut the level of abstraction down as you describe, the Bad
Guys jump immediately to the ISZ and then straight to the SDZ around the
planet.  Great.  What game mechanic is in place that says they have to
actually attack the defending fleet?  IE:  Once they are within 50000km of
the world, what rules mechanic is in place to say that they have to defeat
the defense fleet before bombing the world?  

        Logically, the defenders would engage the incoming warships from the
edge of the SDZ, to allow as early an engagement as possible.  However, with
space being loosly defined as "bigger than really, really big", and
engagements really only taking place by mutal consent, how does your concept
handled "end runs" instead of "break throughs"?

        What would happen is rather much like current naval doctrine of
"SAG"\'s (Surface Action Groups).  You spread your defenses out over the area
by priority...  really, who *cares* if he refuels?  Sure, its a great
opprtunity to bushwhack at cruiser with an SDB, but otherwise, what
difference does it make?  Since the only thing that can hurt a cruiser+
sized vessel is a spinal mount, and they pile so many hits on in one shot,
not to mention criticals, a full fuel tank can become an empty tank in one
soild hit anyway.  If he tries to escape by jumping out, ok, he can\'t use
any energy-consuming weapons and you get to pound on him unanswered.  This
is hardly a bad thing.  
        So you put a few picket ships out at each of the SDZ\'s with a
cruiser as the SAG commander, resign yourself to them being flaming datums
when the bad-guy shows up and stack your biggest assets around the things
you cannot afford the bad guy to attack.

        For system interdiction, then perhaps the battle for the gas giant
will become the meat grinder and not the main world.  Most major systems
will be able to survive just fine for considerable time with interstellar
trade interdicted.
