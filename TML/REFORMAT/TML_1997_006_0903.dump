    'body' => '     I finally received Milieu Zero and First Survey... well, I am not
blaming IG for the delay, because I am \'overseas\' and I was not able to
order them immediately after release, but, anyway, it has been a long
time reading all the comments in the TML and not being able to say
anything.
     So, now, my time has come <g>... just a few general words, and I will
review First Survey in a sector I know: Massilia.

     Milieu Zero seems great. To begin with, it has been great to see
my name among the rumormongers <G>. And now I can see that really
M:0 has a distinctive flavor... a very different Imperium, at least very
different from the M:1100 one. The Zhunastu school of contact is really
interesting: manipulate all those worlds into the Imperium, and make a
profit from every step. Cleon must have had a Hiver teacher.
     Unfortunately, the references of the text do not match the FS
data of Core that is included in M:0. The astrographical references (\'one
subsector rimward from Sylea\', \'two subsectors spinward from Sylea\')
match the T4 rulebook Core subsector, that seems to be non-canon now,
and not the FS one. And, well, there are all the already discussed
problems with the UWPs of the Chanestin Kingdom, etc.
     What is a real pity is the fact that M:0 does not really fit with First
Survey as a whole. How many worlds are there suitable for a campaign
following the contact scheme? For the PCs to be "Visitors form the
Stars", the world should have starport X, and, well, there are no X
starports in the nine sectors. I suppose the E starports have taken their
place, but there are not much of them either.
     And, well, I thought M:0 should provide the general background,
and it does pretty well, but I also thought FS should provide the specific
flavor, but that\'s not the case. Thousands of UWPs, but no summaries.
What is the date? Which worlds are Imperial, where are the influence
zones? Not to speak of the BIG Gob-Law level mistake. And a big
problem is that the maps are totally useless to get a general picture,
without the starports. OK, the players should not know them, but we refs
want to know the aspect of a zone... is that A starport in that barren world
isolated, or is near a hi pop world? Check half a dozen UWPs in three
different pages to find the answer.

     The sector I know in more detail is Massilia. I treasure the 1120
data, continue to develop the Rebellion and Collapse effects, and was
very eager to put my hands on the Year Zero data. The 1120 stats were
published in Knightfall, a GDW publication whose copyright is now
property of FFE, so one should expect some compatibility. Even more,
given that the Massilia Library Data published in TD 11 and reprinted in
Knightfall showed data relevant for Milieu Zero.
     From inspection of the Massilia data, I deduced the rule used for
changing or not changing names: If the world is Hi Pop in 1120, then the
name is not changed in FS. If not, it is changed. Has anybody noticed if
this is the general rule? We could argue about the reasons, but, well, it\'s
already done...
     There are general inconsistencies. It is not clear which date
(even which century) the data corresponds to. Too developed to be Year
Zero, for instance. I suppose we could take the UWPs as some sort of
average over the years 0-200, but then they are not really useful.

     But there are some specific problems. Let me list a few, just in
case FS gets fixed and somebody cares.

     1) THE REBIN EMPIRE. Quote Knightfall: "The Rebin Empire is
a pocket empire long since reabsorbed into the Imperium, but
maintaining a disctintive local culture. Rebin (0312) is the homeworld of
a highly technological, matriarchal culture that settled the inhospitable
systems around itself in the latter part of the Long Night".
     So, it should be a pocket empire in Year Zero, right?. Problem:
Rebin (now Ande) is Barren. Pop exp=0, Pop mult=0. Well, in 1120,
quoting Knightfall again, "the colony worlds hold the bulk of the
"empire"\'s population, while the pleasant homeworld is artificially
restricted to the estates of ruling nobles and their servants". In 1120, this
means Pop=4. OK, fix it saying that the homeworld has already been
restricted to the nobles and, as they do not live there permanently, the
computed Pop is really 0. But it is a bit forced. The most probable
explanation is that nobody cared when rerolling the data.

     2) ANAMONI. Quote Knightfall: "Anamoni (1510) was settled in
the late 400s, soon after the First Survey located mineral resources
buried far beneath the planet\'s icy shroud".
     So, it should not be settled in Year Zero. Problem: Anamoni
(now Aankhi An) has 20 million inhabitants... that\'s going to be difficult to
fix. Is the planet going to be depopulated and re-settled later?

     3) SHIG. In FS, Shig (0510) is an Ancient site and has an
incredible population of 400,000 million (400 billion for you americans),
more than 1/4 of the total population of the sector, and almost the
population of the whole Vland sector. Clearly, a VERY important world..
In Knightfall, Shig (then Cluseret) has only 70 million inhabitants and is
not an Ancient site anymore. Okay, 1,100 years is a lot of time, but
either the world has lost an average of 360 million inhabitants per year
during more than a millennia, or there has been a real catastrophe, a
major event in the history of the Imperium. You don\'t lose 400,000
million people (ans an Ancient site) in the blink of an eye. Well, this has
to be delliberate, because Pop B cannot be rolled under the rules, right?.

     4) SHIWONEE. The Geonee homeworld, now called Asadug
(1430), has now pop A (40,000 million). In 1120, it has pop 8. What a
pity that TD 11 write-up of the world stated that "The planetary
population has stabilized around the present figure for the last 200,000
years (...) Almost all species of life on Shiwonee have evolved with
some form of mass migration, and the Geonee culture allows the
humans this same necessary survival tactic".
     So Pop A does not really fit in the scene. The 200,000 years
stability figure could be a typo, I guess, but, anyway, you cannot have
40,000 million people following the temperate zone in a permanent mass
migration. I have already started to build up a story of this, based on
partial wheather control and orbital stations, as you can see in the
Geonee Timeline and the Milieu Zero Setting, in the Geonee Online
Sourcebook.

     5) MURCIA (2109). Hipop in 1120, it has just 80 inhabitants in
Year Zero. The problem is that, according to Knightfall, the world has a
detailed, distinctive history, with Solomani colonists (I guessed that:
Murcia is the name of a province just south of mine here in Spain), and a
Vilani culture which "allowed the locals to survive" through the Long
night, before the planet "joined the Third Imperium". Well, they did not
survive very well, right? It should have been a curious situation, 80
people joining the Third Imperium as the only survivors of the Long
Night...

     6) STELLAR TYPES. Uhhh... can Stellar types change in 1,100
years?. Nilton (1239) has a star F1 V in Knightfall, but back in FS, the
system (now Kiig Ki) exhibits an F1 VI star. Can a VI star change to V in
1,100 years? Have any other stellar types been also changed? Well, let\'s
pretend its a typo, but I would be worried if there are hundreds of minor
stellar changes, not involving the "Dwarf/Not Dwarf" question.

     That\'s enough for now. I do not really know what to do with the
FS data for Massilia. I do not like the general aspect of the UWPs, but I
hesitate to jump to my own alternate universe so early. Well... I am
going to fix at least Shokee and Shiwonee subsectors (the main Geonee
area, of course ;-) )

Because you\'ve spent all your life in an atmosphere and at the bottom
of a gravity well, you have a distorted notion of physics.

In space (ie 99.999999% of the universe), once you start the ship
spinning it\'ll *stay* spinning until something is done to *stop* the
spinning. 

So it\'s far more efficient to just start the "slow roll" and let it
contibue until combat is over. The computers can easily correct for it
in both the sensor readings and in the aiming of the weapons. 

On the other hand, unless you are *very* close, or have *exceptional*
sensors, you can\'t "correct" for the spin of a target, because while
it\'s not that hard to measure doppler shift on radar signals and the
like to tell how *fast* the target is spinning, determining *which way*
it is spinning is a *lot* harder. Hard enough that I don\'t see it being
a feature of combat sensors. 

Besides, what few "corrections" you coul make would be pretty
meaningless except at *very* short ranges.

Wrong. Even if you keep the 6g drive limit, please note that in M0,
g-comp is limited to *3g* at TL12. So a fighter can run at 6g because
the pilot is taking the 3 "uncompensated" g on his back. In a ship,
it\'d be almost impossible to get around the ship with the same
acceleration. 

Heck, going by real world test results, the pilot should be able to hit
13 g or better (10g or better uncompensated) for minutes at a time.
That makes dodging things a *lot* easier.

It\'s not like fighter aircraft where the g-forces run head-to-toe.

Yes and no. The subs *can\'t* communicate without giving away their
position. A spaceship can\'t *hide* it\'s position, and the commlags
aren\'t that great except in to cases. Frst, intersystem jumps. Second,
travell between planets. Anyplace "near" a planet and they have quite
reasonable comm-lags, and no reason not to.

Sorry, but since you are trying to *dock* with him, you\'ve got it
exactly *backwards*. You\'l have already *matched* the forward motion.
It\'s the movements from the attitude thrusters that matter, because
you\'ve already *cancelled* any other *relative* motion. It doesn\'t
*matter* that both of you are flying at a zillion km/sec relative to
somebody else, only what your motions relative to *each other* are.

Half right.

The fighter should have a compact structure. *But* "thrusters" belong
on outriggers to give more leverage (moment arm) when turning. And you
might as well hang some ordinance from the struts. It saves space. Just
like the "wings" on attack choppers. More hardpoints.

And of course you have sensors out on the struts as well, for the extra
resolution the seperation gives you. 

I can\'t think of any good reasons to put beam weapons on the struts but
maybe there is one. 

So the Babylon 5 fighter designs actually make a fair amount of sense.
The ones in the episode I just watched had the main engines at the ends
of struts in an "X" shape, with a spherical main body. Reasonable
design, as it lets you use the main engines to rotate the ship *fast*.

Sure you do. It takes energy to *start* rotating and to *stop*
rotating. It takes none to *continue* rotating. It\'s not like there\'s
friction with something to slow you down. 

So you just put some spin on the ship and let it *keep* spinning.
Continually starting and stopping the spin would be a nightmare.

Sure, then you don\'t need to. But once you start rotating, it\'s easiest
to *stay* rotating until you are sure the fight is over. *one* blast of
the attitude jets, or spin/despin command to the gyros. Then you just
"coast" until you send the command (opposite of the previous one) to
stop the spin. And each uses up the same amount of energy.

As noted in another message, a ship won\'t have a sensor shadow that
extends as much as a hull length from it. It\'s too unsafe for both long
and short range maneuvering.

Well, if you are outside the 100 diameter limit (or even *inside* it,
but desperate) you *can* do a "jump 0". But it\'ll be a week later when
you reappear.

One of the fun things about H. Beam Piper\'s hyperdrive was that the
jumps were instantaneous in realspace, but took time in hyperspace
proportional to the distance travelled. So if you jumped from A to B,
waited 10 minutes, and jumped back, you\'d reappear at A 10 minutes
after you left. But it might be several *months* of shipboard time if A
and B were far enough apart.

This would royally mess up too much of Traveller though.

Your idea is interesting, but the time to cross that .1 light second
had better be *more* than 1/1700 second. If not, it\'d be useable as a
stardrive. After all, a parsec is *only* about 100 million .1 light
second jumps. So 100 million times your "instantaneous" had better be
more than a week or we have a new stardrive.

It\'d also make for missiles that can\'t be stopped. Blink--blink----boom!

The problem is that in space things are moving in *all* directions
relative to you, so the only "blind spot" that is acceptable from an
ordinary *safety* point of view is a *very* narrow cone centered on the
exhaust of your reaction drive, and you\'d do your best to eliminate
*that* as that will be the *leading* edge of the ship while
decelerating. 

With thruster plates, you should have 360 degree sensor coverage.

This is another one of those cases where experience on earth does *not*
translate into space at all well. Just keep in mind that even if you
are only interested in the area more or less "ahead" of the ship (ie in
the direction it is moving), that can be *any* direction relative to
the ship\'s nose, solely depending on what sort of course changes the
ship is making. So again we wind up *requiring* sensors that cover the
entire sphere. Blind spots just aren\'t acceptable in the design.

Sadly, it\'s not *difficult*, it\'s *impossible*. Or the next thing to
it. It\'d be like trying to approach a group of *alert* soldiers who are
standing in a circle facing outwards on a large stretch of bare, level
ground. You *will* be seen by one or more of them.

It\'s *harder* to stealth a small sub. And it takes a lot of power to
haul a decent towed array, plus, communications underwater are *lousy*.

The sensor and communications picture are *totally* different. The only
reason small ships are stealthier is *because* they are small. That
means less signal, all other things being equal. 

And in space, you can have "tight beam" comm links. Underwater that\'s
just *not* possible at anything *approaching* useful scouting ranges. 

Underwater visibility (via anything but sonar or mass detector) is
virtually nil. And even via those, it will be limited. Communictions is
just about impossible at anything but short range (until you get
"magic" comm units like meson communicators).

In space, visibility is unlimited. It\'s a *rare* situation when there\'s
something to hide behind. And communications are *easy*, laser, maser,
whatever, you can have comm links that are hard to tap. (yes, somone
more or less on the line joining the two ships, but farther away will
be able to pick up "spill". But with a decently narrow beam, that\'s not
anything to worry much about.

Sorry, but there\'s a major problem here. Ships *will* have IR sensors,
simply necause that\'s the best *passive* means of spotting things. and
actually *better* than active radar at spotting objects a long ways
off. 

On IR, your F-117 is the equivalent of a road flare. The backgound
(empty space) is at 3K. The life support areas of the ship are at 300K
(read, 100 *million* times as bright). The engineering spaces and
especially the engines or drive may have substantial areas at 3000k or
higher (read one *trillion* times as bright as the background). 

That\'d be like trying to sneak up on the cargo plane while aiming
landing lights at the pilot!

And before you try to say that you\'ll "stealth" the ship with regards
to IR, better consider that this is *very* hard to do. It\'ll take
*huge* amounts of power to cool just the side facing the other ship
down to a "safe" temperature, and it\'ll require dumping so much extra
heat from the other side that you\'ll stand out like a beacon to anyone
looking from that side. The more narrowly you restrict your emissions,
the more power it takes, and the more visible you are from the angle
you still emit. 

So you\'d better pray that there\'s no one around to ask "what the hell
is that bright IR signal?" and thus tip off your target. And also, I\'m
pretty sure that the power requirements make IR stealth impractical.

Consider how much power it takes to lower the temp of the inside of
your fridge by 20 degrees C or so. Doing so by 297 degrees will take
around 50,000 times the power. And that\'s not taking into account the
fact that you have things inside that are *producing* heat. 

At a guess, reducing the engineering heat emissions to 3k would take
around 500 *million* times the power your fridge uses (and this is on a
volume for volume basis).

Remember, the relationship between energy and temperature is roughly:
  E=T^4
That\'s why all these power and brightness factors climb so high, so fast.

One thing that fighters can do easily that ships have a hard time doing
is run aty accelerations *higher* than the G-comp can handle. Since
acceleration in a space fighter is *transverse*, not "vertical", the
pilot can withstand high accelerations for a *long* time if he\'s been
trained and kept in decent condition. For example, taking 2g flat on
your back should be possible *indefinitely*. 3g would be possible for a
number of turns. 

This means that while ships are restricted to (say) 3g so as to allow
for damage control and the like, the fighters can run at 5-6g. That\'s a
big advantage. 

Of course, missiles can do even better....

Again, remember that *space* fighters take g forces in a different
direction than aircraft do. So the g-tolerance is a *lot* higher.

This also puts fighters back into the early role of aircraft on
seagoing vessels. Scouting. 

Your sensors can detect a bogie a long ways off. And get some info
about it. But stealthing and passive countermeasures can limit the
certainty of the info. 

So you send a couple of fighters out to take a look. They have the
extra gs to go out, take a "close" look and return, unlike your larger
ships (they also use a lot less fuel in doing so). 

If it\'s harmless, fine. If the bogie is a hostile trying to look
harmless, he has to hope that his camouflage holds up at close range.
If he starts shooting, the game\'s up. He won\'t get closer to the big
ships, and they may just be able to damage him badly even at such long
ranges. Plus, the fighters can take a few shots, and louse up his
targetting. Heck, since he has to lie doggo until he\'s *sure* he\'s been
indentified, that means that the fighters get their first shot "free",
as that shot is likely the first indication he\'s going to get. :-)

Point defence isn\'t a lot of help when someone has closed to *visual*
range before firing.

Networking won\'t be a lot better, but you could try combining email
with the "ref and 15 players" bit. It\'d be rather like the way I\'m told
the local miniatures club used to handle campaigns. They\'d use
"boardgame" rules for moving (often handling moves via phone or the
like) until they had units come close enough to fight. Then the
designated commanders of those units would be informed, while the other
folks set up the sandtable for the battle.

I and some friends discussed this a long time back. We figured that you
have the players give orders via email and check in on a fixed schedule
(daily, every other day, twice a week, weekly). The ref plots the moves
and tells them what happened. When they encounter another player\'s
"unit", then the ref arranges for a face-to-face (or say an IRC
channel) for a battle. The results then propogate to other "units"
(fleets) at the speed of whatever couriers have been sent.

Given either all local players, or all players being able to connect to
the internet realtime, you could even write software to let people have
a *real* "fog of battle" as they see only what the computer says they
can see. :-)

Picture sitting at your computer, and logging onto the "battle server".
You come out of jump and wait for the sensor readings to tell you
what\'s going on. Sensor lag will be real. Passive sensors show the way
things were seconds, minutes, even *hours* ago for some things. There\'s
a slowly expanding ring on the display showing how far the signal from
your emergence has gotten. at intervals behind it, other rings indicate
how old sensor returns from inside them are.

You watch as bthings sappear on the screen. Some are identified almost
immediately. Others aren\'t. And sometimes a signal changes from
"harmless" to "enemy" as you detect ships trying to lie quiet. And you
give orders for fighters to check out the nearer "unkown" blips. And
head in on your mission, hoping that you don\'t see a major enemy force
blossom on the screens.

It\'d be fun, but we\'d need to write a lot of software....

I think it\'s difficult, if not impossible, to analyze the relative
merits of fighters vs capital ships without having a context to place
the conflict in. (My wife is a religous studies grad student, so I\'ve
learned lots of neat concepts like \'context\' from stuff she studies.)

Let\'s get specific.

Why, in T4, is the fighter said to give the new Third Imperium an
advantage over other interstellar empires?

First of all, why are the Syleans the only ones with fighters? Fusion
plants have a very large minimum size and the invention of fusion+ allows
small fusion plants for the first time, ever. (We all knew that though).

OK, so, why would fighters be an advantage? I\'ll present one mostly-
handwaving argument.

Historically, in almost all fields of battle, the upper hand has gone to
the side that has redefined how the battle is fought. The victor is almost
always the one who fights the battle on their own terms. Gunpowder in
Europe. The German blitzkreig in WW2. Submarines versus surface convoys.
The advantage doesn\'t last forever - this is an important point. But there
is an advantage for a while and often it\'s long enough to have won a lot
of battles if not the entire war (OK, so not the blitzkreig in that case).

How would the introduction of space fighters in the sub-100Td range have
changed the field of battle in Year 0?

Well, what would have been there before? Big capital ships. With BIG guns.
There probably would have been a period of escalation in the size of ships
and in the size of spinal mounts, the only things that could damage these
big ships. As somebody else mentioned, no one wins a war in space - wars are
won on the ground. So, you\'d have big ships carrying troops to take over
systems. You\'d have big ships with big spinal mounts attacking them. You\'d
have big ships with big spinal mounts and armor defending the troop transports.
Those empires that can build bigger ships and more of them will be able
to win space battles. It is, however, really expensive to build those
giant things. There isn\'t a choice though - the smallest power plant you
can build is, what, 250Td? You might as well exploit economies of scale
and build the biggest damn ship with the biggest damn gun you can think of.
Side bonus for meson spinal mounts - you can do rather accurate orbital 
bombardment with it. In Year 0 there aren\'t very many deep meson sites
to give you trouble. Atmospheric combat is handled by fighters specifically
designed for it (and powered by MHD turbines probably). Ground combat
is again, handled by ground combat vehicles - again, there isn\'t a power plant
effective enough to power small grav vehicles yet. You\'d see vehicles with
a disturbing resemblance to modern combat vehicles. (Note: This is what
T4 canon tells us. We have to partially disregard the descriptions in MT
books like COACC because there isn\'t a viable power source for grav vehicles,
even though the gravitic technology exists, until TL12.)

Enter the Sylean Empire and Fusion+. Suddenly you can build small, fast,
high-endurance space fighters.

So, what changes?

Imagine, you\'re a Vilani officer aboard the ZS Eneri VIII battleship.
It\'s a 10,000Td egg-shape, with Jump-2, maybe 3Gs of acceleration (all that
you can compensate) and a whopping big meson gun, the biggest you can hold.
(The Vilani like spheres for ship hulls, but a sphere is the worst thing
in the world to put a spinal mount in. Eggs are a nice comprimise for those
old-fashioned Vilani). What other weapons are there? Some missles maybe.
Maybe a few point defence weapons, anti-missle lasers, but not much other
than the spinal mount. There\'s no use for anything else - it isn\'t able
to damage the enemy. Military doctrines is to close into spinal mount
range on the enemy as fast as possible then hit them before they hit you.
(Hopefully you have a longer range and more armor). That\'s it.

One day, you engage the enemy (a strange looking vessel without a spinal
mount - easy target!) and before you manage to close in close enough
to loose your meson gun, the enemy ship disgorges a couple hundred ships
that are about 50td each. Huh? What do you shoot them with? You\'ve got a
few missles, but not enough. You have a few point defence lasers, but not
that many. What the hell is powering those things? You\'ve got the meson
gun, but it can\'t come to bear fast enough on those things (which are probably
pulling 6 or more Gs, with pilots in acceleration tanks). Sure you\'re
heavily armoured, but they can get real close and punch through the soft 
parts - probably even firing right into the main meson firing tube!!
This is not looking good. You\'d run, but they can chase you. Hopefully you\'re
not too close to a gravity well to jump...

Now, this sort of situation wouldn\'t last long - maybe a century until all
the old ships get destroyed and ship yards have had time to turn out
ships that are bristling with a mixture of small, medium and large weapons.
In that century though, the Sylean Federation becomes the Third Imperium.

That\'s why fighters will beat big ships IN YEAR 0. General comparisons
of capital ships vs fighters are too vague to be meaningful.

No, a ship that flips over constantly in the same direction is 
spinning. I\'m talking about a ship that flips over in a direction
that\'s convenient to the pilot to accomplish what he wants. If he
wants to bring that extra turret to bear, he flips over in direction
A. If he wants to make sure that the hangar bay faces incoming
ships, he flips in direction B.

No but you don\'t want your sensors bunched together like that. One
good shot could take them all out. You want your sensors spread out
over the ship\'s hull. You also want more than one sensor array per
type of sensor you have for redundancy purposes.

There are three situations here.
a) you have one sensor array per sensor type and they\'re all bunched
   together
b) you have one sensor array per sensor type and they\'re spread out
   over the ship
c) you have several arrays per type and they\'re spread out over the
   ship

Clearly C is the best choice. With A, you\'re _required_ to roll your
ship in order to get maximum sensor coverage. With B it\'s the same,
but the complexity of the rotation _can_ be great, depending upon the
distribution of the arrays. With C you don\'t need to rotate.

Some people say they are useless for attacking Capital ships, some say
they should be kings of teh spaceways.  The major problem is that for
T4, we have no fighters to argue about.  The three in Starships are
broken.  The other Traveller incarnations aren\'t much better off.  TNE
had the Rampart and the Wildbat. CT and MT had a few.

I say we make the next THUDD about designing fighters.  They are pretty
intersting to build.  We would have to agree on a mission
specification.  Heavy fighter, light fighter, long range patrol craft
(week duration), short range patrol craft, sensor/picket fighter,
ground attack, but once you have one built, it is easy enough to
modifiy it to another mission. 

Once we have these made up, we can start arguing with some facts to back it up.

What do you say?

PS I think Fighters are useless for attacking capital ships, but pretty
good at attacking civilian ships, undefended and lightly defended

I concede the point. I hadn\'t thought of that. However, it still
means you rotate during combat. When in "peacetime" you don\'t need
to, unless you have poorly designed sensors (which I posted about
in a different message).

That\'s a good point Craig.  My thinking was that the primary use of the
Patrol Cruiser was independent anti-pirate missions which would seldom (if
ever) call for more than J-2.  As to working with Fleets, remember that
tenders and other slow craft will be Jumping with a fleet at times, and they
will rarely waste the space on J-3.

More than anything else, the Jump AND Maneuver issues are both issues of
design rather than standard.

Yes, that is correct.  Unless specifically mentioned, the TL for standatd
THUDDD competitions is TL-12 current Imperial Tech.  As the Imperium grows,
and consequently the ISBA, the tech level will likely change, but unless it
is said to be changed, the TL is 12.

Ya missed the point.  It will see everything.  And it will direct a full
complement of offensive and defensive craft to deal with threats.  If it
doesn\'t have such a complement, ya wouldn\'t send it along. 

As far as defense goes, be careful about passing yourself off as an expert
on stuff you know not much about.  The AWACS has NO jamming capability of
any sort.  Or any other defensive mechanims for that matter (unless you
count four engines).  It\'s defense is to be to see EVERYTHING and direct
other craft to do it\'s dirty work.  Oh, a quick FYI:  the USAF has never
lost an AWACS in combat.

Now space combat is slightly different.  I\'m not a ship designing expert,
so someone on the list correct any mistakes.  I would think active sensors
have a greater range than the weapons.  So assumption #1 is that not too
many weapons can hit it.  Secondly, I\'d build other ships that have great
defensive stuff to protect the ship.  Or possibly add them to the
AWACS-spacecraft.  Third, you\'d keep back a reasonable arsenal of ships to
attack anything that got too close to it.  

I think it\'s a great idea.  If you\'re attempting to achieve space
superiority in a system with a large armada, one of these ships would be
invaluable for C2 functions.  

>Stealthy ships with huge passive arrays, now those are a horse of a

Question: in order to pick up stuff, someone has to been sending out
signals for it to pick up.  Who\'s doing the sending?

Not sure if the point here is valid.  AWACS don\'t jam.  USAF has other
craft to do that.  And without getting specific, suffice it to say there
are lots of ways to avoid being jammed.

   You\'re right, of course.  Speedboats are practically standing still
   as far as modern naval warfare is concerned, so having that kind of
   speed would not give the warship any tactical advantage. If the
   American navy could build a warship that was as fast as a fighter
   though, it would have /great/ military advantage. 

   If you want Traveller fighters to be an analogue to modern fighters,
   you\'ll need to change the rules to give them much greater speed than
   the warships they fight with.  Traveller\'s current rules encourage
   designers to make all of their fighting ships with 6G acceleration;
   this is very cost effective and advantageous with the design and
   combat rules published so far.  You\'ll need to modify these rules to
   make fast warships uneconomical, and keep fast fighters cheap.

   Uh, only if the battle group sees the Osas before they close to

   blow it out of the water, even if they had mere conventional warheads

   This is a good point.  In order to make the fighter analogy work,
   Michael is going to need to change some of the old assumptions about
   the Trav universe.

You\'re assuming that missiles have the same relationship in
traveller combat that they do in modren warfare, ie: a small missile
can kill a big target.  This hasn\'t traditionaly been the case in
traveller, but even if we assume that it is right, there is no
reason to bring a pilot along for the ride!  Just shoot waves of
missiles.

In CT and MT, the fighters would have an advantage that they could mount 40

In ship/fighter, aircraft operate under fundamentally different physical
laws than ships. This is not true in Traveller. The proper analogy is
ship/speedboat (or, as someone more reasonable than I said, ship/FAC.)

In traveller, there are no shields but there is armour - and armour scales
so that big ships can always carry much more.

A fighter will *never* get close enough to use bombs, or even "torpedoes".
If it\'s carrying decent-sized missiles, you might as well save time and 
money and fire the missiles directly.

The typical fighter you\'re talking about is - what - 10 tons?
In the same volume, for less money, a battleship can easily fit 
a 3-ton standard turret plus enough power plant to fire it at ROF 100.
The turret will be able to target fighters just as well as anything else
(at 60,000km a fighter heading towards you doesn\'t exactly have a high
crossing rate.) At 30,000 km or less it will *always* hit (see below). 
A hit from a 750 Mj X-ray laser (TL-15, admittedly) will always kill a
fighter. If the fighters are closing at (say) 20 BL hexes per turn - 
pretty damn fast - the laser will still have time to kill 5 fighters out
of a swarm in the time it takes them to go from 30,000km to "bomb" range.

But note that US doctrine against Soviet ships had really changed to using
standoff weapons - Harpoons, etc. - carried by fighter aircraft rather than
flying right overhead and dropping bombs. Anyone who\'s ever played out such
a scenario in (say) Harpoon knows why this is so...And even in the falklands,
a handful of exocets on Entendards were much more effective than all the iron
bombs (though that\'s a special case.)

Spinal mounts are of limited use against fighters, but good old-fashioned
laser turrets are fine. Hitting a 10-ton fighter at 30,000km is no 
harder than hitting a 10000-ton capital ship at 300,000km (ignoring 
evasion, which helps the capital ship more - see below.) It has the
same angular size, and if the fighter is heading towards you to drop its
bombs while the capital ship is evading, the fighter has *lower* 
apparent crossing velocity...

Have you ever even designed a Traveller starship? With any set of rules?
The M-drive/P-plant to give a 50,000 ton ship 6-G is precisely 5000 times
the size and cost of the M-drive/P-plant to give a 10-ton fighter
6 G.

You may find it absurd, but you\'re wrong.

Laser rule 1: Laser\'s don\'t miss. A laser beam always goes were you want
it to, for all practical purposes - even with modern optical technology you
can design closed-loop tracking systems that give a laser beam an error
circle 14 cm in diameter at a range of 30000 km. (The trick is that you
don\'t do fine aiming by moving the whole laser, but just with a precision
mirror inside the laser assembly, and you have your terminal tracking
sensor looking along the same set of mirrors that will launch the laser.)

If the fighter at 30000km is
heading straigh towards you to drop its bombs, every laser shot the capital
ship fires will hit. If the fighter moving sideways, that still doesn\'t
help - the tracking sensor always keeps the laser centered on the fighter.
Mirrors and computers can always move faster than the fighter. At long ranges
the computer has to "lead" the fighter, but that\'s easy to compute and do.
At 30,000km, you can\'t move fast enough to avoid light.

The only way not to get hit by a laser is not to be where you were (or where
the computer thinks you\'re going to be) when the pulse arrives. You can
do this at medium-long ranges, since the pulse takes a whole second to travel
300,000km - you have two seconds to evade randomly, during which a 6-g fighter
can move itself 120m from its predicted course. At 30,000km, you have 2/10
of a second, which is only long enough to move 1.2 metres - not enough
to not get hit.

Even in the Real World, as laser weapons become practical (take a look at the
USAF planned 747-carried anti-theatre-ballistic-missile system),
I suspect aircraft pilots may be in for a nasty shock. The only things that
will protect aircraft against lasers are atmospheric effects - turbulence,
clouds, etc - that will degrade the beam against low-flying aircraft, and
the fact that TL-8 lasers don\'t have a whole lot of power or good beam
quality. Neither are issues in Traveller.

Wait a second, why exactly would a small craft have very poor targeting.  I

What about weapons that carry there own targetting systems, ala the
Phoenix?  If ship could close to a distance where it could detect a target,
it could fire its missles (or torpedos or whatever).  They should be able
to finish the job from there.  Hey modern day weapons have very effective
targeting system, and they\'re much smaller than a 10 ton space fighter.

I hear what you\'re saying, but I think a much bigger, much more important
point is being missed.  Are fighters useful?  The group of fighters vs. a
single ship is probably a lousy example, \'cause in a war you\'d want to
utilize all the weapons at your disposal.  Each platform has a role (or set
of roles) that it fulfills.  Together, they win a war.

So here\'s the question:  is there a useful role that fighters can perform
in naval (space) combat?  That role doesn\'t have to be killing
dreadnoughts.  If there is a role, then build \'em and use \'em.  If not, don\'t.

Lives are not more expendable.  Not unless your AI systems are capable of
running the whole show (in which case you wouldn\'t use people in the first
place).

Of course, this does depend somewhat upon the culture.  Kamakaze (sp?)
pilots in WWII thought it a Good Thing to die for their country.  In the
Gulf War, Americans were appalled (sp?) any time a pilot or soldier was
killed.

Not really.  Two or three years is a better figure.  Most pilots who have
been in the service 20+ years are in a desk job somewhere, commanding folks.

Bzzzt.  Ever heard of Billy Mitchell?  No?  Go find a library and read up
on him.  The USN can effectively use aircraft to destroy enemy fleets.
Bombs, missiles, and torpedos can sink battleships, carriers, cruisers, and
anything else (except perhaps subs, but that\'s a different question).

Now ideally fighters would not be the ONLY thing the USN used to destroy
the enemy fleet (everything is situationaly dependent).  They would like to
use their battlships, cruisers, destroyers, subs, etc as well.  Everything
should be one big coordinated effort.

The real issue is can Traveller\'s fighters carry weapons that can damage a
large ship.  Logically, yes.  But the real question is what have the ship
designers allowed?  If they haven\'t built such capabilities, then they can\'t.

Well, here you have hit upon the main point and with good accuracy.  If
it\'s not in the game, then it\'s not in the game.  This would be an example
of Real Life not scaling up to Traveller Life.

I suppose we could argue about whether or not it *should* be that way, but
I\'d rather not.  Nobody\'s asked me to design the next version of the game.

Wrong.  Any US aircraft carrier right now is as fast as a speedboat.
Remember with your naval analogies that max speed for a ship is
proportianal to its length :-P

Besides, his point is right.  USe the ship design rules to build
fighters for traveller and look at what they do vs. a big, heavily
armored ship.  BTW, it\'s interesting to try and build a fighter with
high-g drives using any of the design systems that actually count
mass.  You end up having to iterate the process, and it\'s really
hard to get a fighter with a high g-rating.

*blink*  One, armor is a smaller % for a given thickness on a
bigger ship, period (even now, it\'s simple geometry).

The modern naval analogy is broken.  There are no iron bombs in
traveller.  If a fighter can fire a nmasty missile, so can the BB,
all the fighter does is add a crew member to each small group of
missiles.
 
Your WW2 example makes no sense at all.

If the mother ship were to just fire missiles, you needn\'t wait for

At short ranges the PD never misses.  The counter measure is
evasion.

Agility makes no difference at ranges where the travel time of the
weapon is small.  At close range, the fighter evades a fraction of a
meter in the time it takes for the laser to get from its turret to
the fighter.  Unless the fighter evades about a ship radius in this
time period, it will likely get hit (very, very likely).  This is
unarguable.

space fighters aren\'t faster, period.

a 6g ship is a 6g ship is a 6g ship.  My BB can just run away and
you\'ll nevcer catch up (all the while killing a bunch of fighters a
turn).

It is taken for granted that Earth\'s development is the standard by which
civilizations on other worlds advanced technologically. This is fine although
IMO a not wholly accurate way at looking at TL advancement. IMO, it is
possible, for example, for a civilization to be really advanced medically but
lagging in military hardware. The expanded UPP for TL enables one to
differentiate this.

The point of my post is this: I\'d like to see a more detailed version of TL
advancement across the spectrum as it appeared in the CT big black book. I\'ve
had to make my own modifications to it based on the last 20 years of tech and
the speculations about the future it has inspired. Some areas are defined
pretty well (military hardware & jump drives) but there\'s no central
repository of this overrall info that I can find. I haven\'t seen the CSC so I
don\'t know if what I\'m looking for is addressed there. The T4 book covers
this in little blurbs but only for society at TL11. 

Maybe it is up to the ref to determine this on his/her own.

Yes. Because it\'s already published.
:-)

Actually, subregional is the transition between the 30/300/3000 
progression, and the personal combat ranges.

The full table is as follows (Gathered from T4 and CSC):

  0   Contact              3 m
  1   V. Short            15 m
  2   Short               45 m
  3   Medium             150 m 
  4   Long               450 m
  5   V. Long           1500 m
( 6*  E. Long           4500 m  )   
  6?  Subregional         10 km
  7?  Regional            30 km
  8?  Subcontinental     300 km   
  9?  Continental       3000 km
 10?  Orbital          30000 km
 11?  Far Orbit       300000 km

I just noticed there is another range listed in the Vehicle Weapons Table 
on page 59 of the CSC called "E. Long".

If E. Long is "Extra Long" then it would, I assume, fit in at 4500 m.

Note to Marc: If "Extra Long" is indeed a range band, then the table you 
recently posted should start at 7, not 6.

Why waste fuel and time by: firing lasers, thrust to rotate, thrust to

lasers...

When you can: thrust to rotate, fire lasers, fire lasers, fire lasers...

All of my points of course, assume that rotation is only necessary and 
advantageous during combat. *obviously* if you\'re just moving from point 
A to point B without seeing another ship you don\'t *need* to rotate.

The original poster was referring to boarding actions. What kind of 
unsolicited boarding action happens outside of the context of combat?

In a nutshell: Ships expecting or entering into combat that are 
constantly rotating have an advantage over ships that do not. Therefore, 
wise captains keep their ships spinning.

Screen: looks reasonable, lists the new UPP which will be explained later
in pocket empires.  It does not, though, have a table listing the meanings
of the various UPP values, beyond that they are (for example) government.
Sigh.

Still and all, the other tables are fairly good.

EA: Very good work, but I have come to expect that from Greg Porter.

The weapons themselves are reasonable, and I liked the side bars on
antimatter, nukes, and other details.  If this is the quality of work we
can expect from the new IG, I am favorably impressed.  The outside covers
still have Giant Robot art by Chris Foss, but the interior art is
Traveller-specific.

Someone should come up with a canonical answer, though, on what tech level
the Vilani and the ROM made it to.  Several points inside EA refer to TL 13
equipment from the Vilani, which I had thought they did not make it to.  I
am, of course, willing to be shown otherwise.

The TL16 weapons were fairly clever as well.

It is also completely irrelevant because of the tremendous speed
differences between modern vessels, and the destructive power present day
fighters carry.

Until you address that, you had best ignore most modern naval tradition.
We have ultimate weapons in the form of fighter misses and bombs, which
traveller does not.  Introduce those, and fighters come back.

Agreed, they are cool, but I rule that they are not a major factor against

but are not going to make a difference in a fleet action, save against
escorts.

But it will likely not be any more economical to build 5000 10 ton fighters
and a carrier to bring them to the battle location.  Further, the 5000
fighters do not have the spinal mount needed to crush big iron.

For a shore station, you are a bit better off, but then you should compare
the result to a 50000t battle rider carried by a 90kt carrier to you 5000

Perhaps, but one fighter will not take out a battleship.  Are 9000 fighters
more expendable?  Are they easier to replace?  Admittedly, they do build
faster.

So?  If your fission bomb is a light second away, I have certainly seen it,
and if I have enough lasers (and I will - I can put a small laser
sufficient to nail a missile in a very small space, along with fire
directors as needed) I can kill it.

My sensor suite is a lot larger than yours, and I can afford a lot more
computing power here and there to shuffle through it.  Every one of my
people has better information than each of your fighter pilots, and thus is
more likely to get that critical shot.  Remember, unless the fighters are
in a tactical net, which requires communications, I have all of my good
stuff in one spot, whereas yours is spread all over space.

The Traveller fighter is a slow platform - the same speed as the target.
It has light speed weapons which are vastly inferior to the target, and sub
light weapons that are not.  Given that the target may have several HOURS
to target your fighters and their munitions, I would say that there is not
defense, save not being seen, being able to survive the onslaught, or being
able to overwhelm the defenses.

My apologies, but I must really protest at making this analogy.

Ships and space vessels are similar in many ways, but atmospheric fighters
are just NOT similar to anything in Traveller.

They cannot get close enough, and they cannot do enough damage.

[fighters are more survivable]
>I disagree, show me an historical example.  Name one naval battle where a
>battleship with out aircover went into battle with a carrier and won? 

In Traveller, there is no air cover.  None.  Nada.  Zip.

Air cover depends on being able to harm the enemy when he cannot harm you,
with weapons that do damage.  Because Traveller ships all move at roughly
the same speed, and have access to the same weapons, and those weapons go
up in danger with size, there is no equivalent to the fighter plane.

If you think there should be, change the following:

1.  The lack of a small weapons that can get through armor

2.  The tremendous range of starship sensors

3.  The low speed of traveller ships, relative to their sensors.

Note the time scales of present day combat - I see your fighters just about
when they come into their own range, because we have the same weapons, and
they are all overkill.  In Traveller, fighters come into range _hours_
before either of us can fire.

>
>>Also, i would assume that a fighter could get to its top speed a whole

No, I am afraid that is not the case with Traveller physics.

In traveller, things are rated with an acceleration.  6Gs is 6Gs, so the
carrier and the ship have the exact same speed.  Slew rate might make a
difference, but not much of one.

If you add a non-Newtonian drive, then you might have something, but
Traveller does not use drives like this.

No.  In space, at the time scales we are discussing, the only real risk is
hitting micrometeors, and a large ship has the advantage of more armor.  If
you wish to argue this point, then you had best state what assumptions you
are making that differ from traveller canon.

Agreed, and a very good use.  I expect they could also be used for lockons
that are handed off to the main ships out of easy range.  It is a lot
easier to keep tracking something than to find it in the first place.

Well rotating your ship to bring your batteries to bear has its mostly good
points but from the sensor end it sucks.

Example: a 400 dt ship with a large inflatable PEMS array of >100m
diameter. In this example the dish array do not rotate by it\'s own device.
The dish is most sensitive/accurate when the incoming signal source is
perpendicular to the arrays axises. The array is pointing dead ahead ie 0
degree\'s in all axises that matter/count. By rotating the ship the dish
array will be no longer in the most efficient/sensitive/accurate position.
Lets say that the 90 degree axises of the array are 30 degrees out of
alignment with a possible signal source. Due the misalignment the signal
will be perceived by the array as 100% less strong. At 45 degree lets say
that is where your array has side lobes, the incoming signal will be
perceived as 50% less strong. At 75 degrees of misalignment the incoming
signal will be perceived as 300% less strong and at greater 90 degrees
misalignment no signal can be perceived at all. 

So by rotating your ship you will be unable to locate incoming signal
sources until your array is rotated into a position where the misalignment
will allow a signal strength to allow the array to process it into a
possible target. But that a good enough alignment of array and target
source will not occur very often. Lets say once out every ten rotations,
this not very good for tracking a target signal source for use in firing at
the target source.

Lets change the example a little ie the dish array now can rotate and has
stabilization to cover all relevant axises ie generally two axises.

Well having a dish array capable of its own independent rotation on the
surface sounds like good idea, well in a few cases it would be. Those cases
being when the ships rotation will allow for the dish array to stabilize to
the target signal source. But those cases would depend upon how far the
stabilization to occur say 45 degrees above and below main signal axis.
Even with this degree of stabilization most of the ships rotation 70% the
array will not be able to track/detect a target signal.

Both examples were only trying to detect/track a single target source
signal. More than one target signal really mucks up the figures against
ship rotation to unmask batteries.

A better use would be for the main batteries to be mounted such a way that
they can all bear upon targets directly in the front firing arc.

However that is all it can change with attitude jets. Thus it can spin or

Doing so requires a vector change, and at high vectors High Gs are required

I would agree that this would make it terribly difficult, if not impossible,
to dock with the ship. However, it does not significantly impact the ability
to hit the ship. Thus the ship could be hit with a grappel harpoon, and
possibly restrained (depending on relative masses).

I guess I just don\'t see why spacefighters are "cool".  They
strike me as an unoriginal approach of just tacking current
military tatics and sticking them onto Traveller.

Large ships, however, harken back to more romantic times
in WWI when large capital ships dueled and and tried

The problem with this argument is that TNE allows spinal mounts to fire

very effective against fighters.

Unfortuately, I haven\'t really seen much in the way of good missles for TNE,

The space equivalent for noise would be heat radiation and IR signature, and
since it is hand-waved away in the game I think it would be totally fair
for this discussion to wave away the noise problem; either one will throw your

Another thing that just occurred to me: what about frictionless materials? At

sub a coating of Slipee(TM) (a product of Better Way Industries, "Letting You

True it would change your course, but by how much? If it is just attitude
jets, I would have to say: not much. Even rotating and firing main thrust
might only result in a small adjustment to course if you are travelling at
high velocity (which in interplanetary travel you would be).

All of this seems to bring up the point:

When would a battle and/or boarding action take place?

It would seem uncommon for ships to engage at the high velocities envolved in
interplanetary travel, so I would think that battles would tend to occur only
nearby planets and bases. This type of situation definately favors the
defenders, since they have a homeworld advange. The defenders can rely on
support from planet-based weaponry and other elements of their navy.

It also makes the prospects of piracy a bit dicey. Where would the pirate
ship ambush its prey? Velocity would only be slowed down nearby destination
planets, and most of those would be patrolled by the local navy (and possibly
Imperial). Jump point might not be a good spot since ships can jump in
anywhere outside 100 diameters, and can jump in with any velocity and
bearing.

I think this might make privateering more difficult then the concept of
boarding.

Well Franklin, this is coming from the really old section of Traveller
players, but there have been floating GG cities around.  In a adventure
published by White Dwarf, a floating city in a gas giant (named New
World with 100\'s of millions of people on it) contracts the players to
travel to one of their processing stations. I have it at home and it has
to be about 14-15 years old by now. 

Great books, BTW, and I always enjoyed floating cities in Traveller. 
But the reason for not having them are in the adventure. The PC\'s have
to figure out what is wrong with the station as it sinks down into the
gas giant. The gravity and temperature keep increasing until the PC\'s
have start making rolls against endurance. If they don\'t figure it out
in time, POP!, they are crushed.

It is a great starter adventure for new PC\'s and I have used it many
times. In fact, I may be using it again this weekend!

The only reason I can think of is if the fighter has a greater operational
range. In this case, a carrier group would carry fighters (and "bombers", or
missile boats) into battle (the planetary war zone). The group would then
send the fighters and "bombers" in while staying out of the effective range
of the planetary defenders. Under the direction of an ECM ship (an AWACs type
ship), the fighters and bombers would launch their missles once they were in
effective range, then peel off as the main strike fleet closed.

That would be for the element of surprise, and assumes that the fighters and
bombers could close relatively undetected, while the carrier group stayed out
of detection range. Another advantage is that once the fighter/bombers begin
launching, the defenders would probably soon light up their active, spotting
the fighters but turning beacon for the carrier group, which might have a
strike group (cruisers and such) ready to pounce.

The fighter/bombers could then return to the carrier group for a resupply of
missiles.

This would allow the missles to have higher G ratings for shorter durations,
and possibly carry more payload.

___

Now as far as missiles go, how are they done in T4? I haven\'t seen T4 yet,
but the missle design system in TNE made designing difficult. And the nuclear
pumped x-ray didn\'t seem  like the best solution. Perhaps I\'m just partial to
explosions (they\'re pretty and make a lot of noise in the target ship).

This is an incorrect assumption.  Top speed is whatever a space craft has
been built to go upto.  Im sure light speed isnt one of them (mayb absurd
speed:).  Each tech level logically would have an upper limit of the
absolute fastest speed it can build engines to.>>

How is it incorrect?

In space, drag is negligible. If you apply thrust you accelerate in the
direction opposite the thrust. The only thing that acts to decellerate you is
drag, which is neglible. Thus you can continue to accelerate infinitely.
There is no additional stress on the vehicle, no air resistance to overcome.
The only limiting factor is relativity, i.e.: the closer you get to the speed
of light the slower time goes. That and fuel.

Each Tech Level has a limit for maximum G (kind of). But this is simply a
matter of acceleration, a 1G ship has the same "maximum speed" as a 6G ship,
the 6G ship can just get there faster.

However, if you have spent the past week (or whatever) in 6G acceleration,
your vector along your heading would be so extreme that you cannot apply
anything but the smallest changes in course. Thus space combat could not
really occur at such speeds, other then a basic slugfest (after vectors have
been matched) or a rapid exchange of fire (when vectors intersect or come
close). There could be no dogfighting, jinking, or maneuvering for position.
This is why I think space battles would chiefly occur around worlds, gas
giants, and space stations.

>>>
Um, sorry. I do not care how many targets you put out there IF we are
talking about two equal forces. One has BB, the other CV and fighters. =20

Lets look at some basic assumptions:
First, today=92s navy.
For many years the Navy has had to defend the big CV. Why? Too easy for
missiles to destroy.
But the CV has survived, Why? Because the aircraft carry missiles. Big
ship killing missiles. (On another point, the old USSR was very
concerned when the old US Battleships were returned to service, because
the missile war heads had been reduced and would no longer do much
damage to those ships)=20
This ability to stand off and launch big missiles is what makes the
fleet focused on the CV. You have the horizon to hide behind, the
fighters do not have to get close, and weapons that can hurt big ships.=20

In Traveller, fighters have no weapons that can cripple any big ship.
Those factor 1 and 2 missiles will not even dent the sand thrown up by
any capital ship. The EM energy alone could blind most fighters small
computers and sensors. (In space you have to have huge antenna for
resolution) so you would have to get VERY close in space. That means
that the big ship has all the time in the world to pick you off.
Starting at about 150,000 km fighters would be targets. The faster they
go to close range, the more predictable their path would be, easier to
hit.=20

Years of training, building of morale, vs one aircraft. No contest.

>>>
Another poster made the point that even in modern naval warfare planes
are
not very effective against modern Point Defense.  I disagree.  If this
were so why was the last great Battleship engagement was France, 1940?
Also, why do modern Navies still rely on Carriers and land based
aircraft
over battleships?  Because no matter how good or how massed your point
defense is, it wont hit everytime.  Fighters will get threw. =20
<<<
No they wont. Not with equal numbers. Why do fighters carry missiles and
not bombs today. Because the SAM and close air defense will destroy any
and all aircraft within range. These weapon systems are designed to
shoot down missiles that are traveling at Mach speeds, on the deck, and
most aircraft can not do that.  They are considered sitting ducks by the
computers who control the system. If I remember correctly the Phalanx
fires about 1000 rounds per min and tracks each bullet individually to
measure how far it missed by, to correct for the next bullet! I watched
as one chewed up a drone, and then went after the chunks as they
scattered across the ocean, shredding them into even smaller chunks.
Many pilots agreed that even if you ejected, all you would be is another
target. Not a picture the pilots wanted to see. =20
Let me ask why the last great air to ship bomb attack was the
Falklands.  Because the Argentine air force only had a few missiles. So
they had to drop bombs on a fleet. No out on the opne water where they
would have been picked off, but stuck in close to islands (great cover).
On the open sea, with some advance warning it was a different story. The
British had missiles (on a SUB!) and the entire Argentine fleet stayed
in port!!=20

Every ship that his been hit during the past twenty years, to the best
of my recollection, has been hit by missiles.  The British did get hit
by some bombs (dropped too low and did not arm, a good thing, if they
had gone off the aircraft that dropped it would have been damaged), but
the most devastating damage was done by missiles. Also the Argentine air
force had to fly at 10 - 30 feet off the water to avoid being destroyed.
The missile systems and guns have gotten too good so you have to stay
down low and avoid radar coverage and get mixed up in the clutter. Where
do your fighters hide in space?


>>>
SNIP
In a
naval battle the number of attacking craft are usually in the hundreds,
if
there land based attacker, there in the thousands.  I can tell you now,
that the planes will come back with a lot less damage then the
completely
destroyed capital ship.  The aircraft will fight again, but the ship
will not.
<<<

Most actions do not involve 100s of aircraft today. Only if it is a
major war. 100s of missiles are another story. I was in a naval exercise
back in the 80=92s where we launched over 300 (SIMULATED) missiles at the
main Russian fleet. NONE got through. If that had been aircraft, NOBODY
would have returned. Try and convince that next crew to get into the
fighters.

>>>
So they are cost effective.
<<<

Not with those odds. Only if they can return and launch the next wave of
missiles that can actualy do something.

In Traveller that means that you will have to stand off with ship
killing missiles that DO NOT EXIST and launch at targets locked on with
sensors that DO NOT EXIST while hiding behind some horizon or cover that
DOES NOT EXIST to be effective.  So in Traveller, as we understand the
technology and weapons, fighters are reduced to being a small boat with
machine guns that somebody else mentioned.=20

>>>

Not really, since most of these weapons will be designed for larger ship

In space that does not apply. The range is what throws most people off.

that is close range!

This is an incorrect assumption.  Top speed is whatever a space craft

absolute fastest speed it can build engines to.

Speed and combat in space do not relate at all to ground base combat. In
space there is no upper limit on how fast a ship can go, until you start
getting close to light speed. Look at the small probes we have launched.
No engines to speak of, but through the use of gravity and slingshot
effects they are really moving now. (somebody correct me, but is
100,000+ kph about right?)And it still takes them YEARS to reach the
edge of our solar system.

In Closing:
I will not, nor will anyone else stop you from using fighters. They are
lots of fun and many people will believe in them based on Star Wars and
other shows. However, within Traveller rules, and our best guess about
reality, (such as that is:) fighters are about as useful as pigs in
space.

So, Launch the fighters and fire the wave motion gun!! Its a game!

Subject: Fighter Design

Everyone seems to be arguing over how effective space fighters are.
Some people say they are useless for attacking Capital ships, some say
they should be kings of teh spaceways.  The major problem is that for
T4, we have no fighters to argue about.  The three in Starships are
broken.  The other Traveller incarnations aren\'t much better off.  TNE
had the Rampart and the Wildbat. CT and MT had a few.

I say we make the next THUDD about designing fighters.  They are pretty
intersting to build.  We would have to agree on a mission
specification.  Heavy fighter, light fighter, long range patrol craft
(week duration), short range patrol craft, sensor/picket fighter,
ground attack, but once you have one built, it is easy enough to
modifiy it to another mission.

Once we have these made up, we can start arguing with some facts to back it 
up.

What do you say?

Lewis Roberts
PS I think Fighters are useless for attacking capital ships, but pretty
good at attacking civilian ships, undefended and lightly defended
civilian installations, such as mining colonies, asteroid cities, etc.

Yes, I think we should begin fixing the fighter problem.  Actualy, the boyz 
in X-TEK R&D have already begun building fighters.  Look for them soon on 
the PLanet X homepage.  In designing the fighters i discovered only  that 
designing the sensor system is imposible with QSDS or SSDS, unless al you 
wan is to put lowsy civilan packages on the things.  I have an Idea that VDS 
was used to make the ones in the books, mind you I will concurr that those 
designs are broken.  I think i will sen the first fighter entry, as i alrady 
have my 10Td XTF-1A Alpha Fighter Ready.  It\'s your basic fighter, pulling 
6G\'s with t-plates, with EMMasking and powered by a Fusion+ (of course).  It 
carries a Standard Military Laser System and 2 Missile \'pods\' Capable of

Most of you on ISBA also know of mine and Baron Colsworth\'s Missile boat 
project.  A 70td heavy fighter/bomber using Colsworths missile system.  This 
boat would be able to launch many missiles at other fighters or a full salvo 
at a capital ship.

Just because I jumped the gun a bit don\'t mean the rest of y\'all should be 
intimmidated.  I would love to see the ISBA, and non-aligned Shipbuiders 
alike start designing fighters. Personaly, and this is in no way a slur to 
his majesty,  I think the old Zhunastu Fighters of the early imperial 
expanision era are a bit outdated.  Sure, the workd well against the 
Chanestins, but its the 3rd decade already.  How do we know that the 
Wolflike aliens to core dont have fighters?  Or the Solomani States to rim?

   In TNE, big ships as well as fighters can have more than 6G
   acceleration.  This is why there are no real fighters in Trav, only
   "gunboats".  If you want fighters to be feasable, you\'ll need to make
   some rules up that give them an advantage over big ships.  The
   current rules treat them exactly like big ships, only smaller.

*blink*  missiles have infinite range.  I let them coast towards

I don\'t see how there is any complexity to the rotation. If you scatter your

full coverage. Works just like a rotating radar, which is what EVERYTHING

Today\'s fighters can engage air targets at ranges of no more than
100km (or so), while engaging surface targets at roughly half that
distance.  Traveller fighter sensors allow them to actively engage
targets a thousand times further away.  This would require some
powerful sensor arrays by today\'s standards (compared to a modern-day
fighter).

BTW, the new F23 is approximately 66 feet long if memory serves,
comparable to a Traveller 10t fighter.

In my opinion, units that are tasked with fighting the Zhodani would be
equipped with psionic shields as a matter of basic issue.

Large items, from grav tanks to Tigress-class BBs, would probably have psi
shields built into the structure.

Please explain, in some detail, how exactly you are going to use the weather
to hide a fleet in space.  Or are you also assuming that in every battle one
side will have cracked the other\'s codes.

Well, If I wanted to waste my time lining up the spinal mount for a shot at
a fighter, I could do it.  I have designed a 90kton battleship, and it has
350 laser turrets.  More than enough to discourage any group of fighters.

Meanwhile my Battleships are boosting towards your carrier.  Since I\'m
heading straight for it, and your fighters have to change course and begin
heading back, what do you want to bet that your flying repair station is
toast by the time you get there?

Not if my armor is thick enough.  My "Royal" class BB is heavy enough to
require me to recalculate drive effiency due to the density of the thing.

You are basically strapping a trained pilot onto a missile to do a job that
a Gunner\'s Mate, 2nd Class should be doing in the Combat Command Center:
guiding missiles onto the target.

Actually, the Iowa class BB was very fast, faster than some of the
destroyers that were supposed to escort it.

A F-14D SuperCat costs in the $35 million range, plus about 1.5 million to
train one crew for it.  About 18 planes per squadron.  A little over 650
million dollars for one squadron!  Add in the cost of maintenance and fuel,
and you\'ll see that modern fighters are not economical.

The dive-bombers hid in the clouds, and the torpedo-bombers flew close to
the surface.  Neither of these tactics will work in deep space.  Also, in
the example given, target detection was still a function of the Mk 1
eyeball, as most ships didn\'t have reliable radar at that point.

But if I see you coming 90,000km away?  A capital ship will have cruisers
that can devote a great amount of firepower to breaking up your fighter
formation.

Did you know that an Iowa class Battleship\'s waist armor can bounce a

Then why does the US Navy plan on expending 2/3 of its fighters\' weaponry at
beyond visual range?  The AIM-54C Phoenix missile has a range of over 100
miles!  The AMRAAM nearly 60.. All modern anti-ship weapons are designed to
be fired from long ranges.  This is because, even in our TL8 world, if you
can see it you cna kill it.  In space, there is no horizon to hide behind,
no clouds to mask your approach.. the moment you start an intercept course,
the target knows you are coming, and will start trying to kill you.

Aircraft won because they could strike before the target could react.
Period. Now, we have refined Air Defence to the point where manned fighters
react too slowly to survive.  So now the emphasis is switched to drones such
as the Tomahawk cruise missle.  Even the AIM-54 is self guiding in the
terminal phase, and the Air Force is developing fire and forget missles that
acquire their own targets, and communicate among themselves to insure even
target distribution!

>How wouldnt this hold true in Traveller?

Because speed is relative.  A 6-g fighter that has been accelerating for 20
minutes is a lot slower than a 1-g BB that has been thrusting for a day.
Unless your closing velocity is faster than my computer can react to, I\'m
going to target your fighter.  Why not just save the space for the fighter,
its crew and maintenance folks, and launch tube, and just add missile
storage and MFDs?

Modern fighters are referred to as weapons platforms for a reason.. They
exist solely to deliver munitions.  In the ship attack role, that is done by
launching Harpoons from 40+ miles away.. *Nobody* directly attacks a naval
formation, since every naval vessel in the world has SAMs and guns just for
knocking down pesky aircraft.

This brings me back to my point:  since all you\'re going to do is launch a
missile, wouldn\'t it be better to launch from a well protected ship with a
MFD?

   (Donning professorial robes and beginning a physics lecture) Ahem,
   not true at all.  If the two beligerants have matched vectors (and if
   they are close enough to one another) then they can dogfight quite
   nicely.  If their vectors are matched, then they are standing still
   relative to one another.  When they turn on their drives, they
   accelerate, decelerate, and alter course about one another exactly
   like they would if they started from rest ---- because really, they
   /are/ starting at rest.

   Unfortunately, none of the tactical combat systems introduced sinced

   Well, mostly battles occur around things of value.  Interplanetary
   space is not usually very valuable.  So I agree with your conclusion,
   but not with your reasoning.

Sure it can, depending upon how you define "rapid". If I can spin in
any direction, I can use those same jets to slide in any direction.
Not as quickly as the maneuver drive would do it, but still effective
enough to block boarding attempts.

The term "rapid" implies speed. Accelerating long enough produces
speed. That\'s why the M-drive is "faster"; it has more acceleration.
In theory, I can use just steering jets to go to the moon. In practice,
that would take longer than my one-month fuel supply would allow.

No. High Gs are required to effect a vector change rapidly. If I

I do not discount the high probability of such an encounter, and as a
work of fiction, it could be considered highly accurate.

Traveller, however, is a RPG with a limited selection of rules.  No
version of the traveller ship combat rules would allow fighters to
"get real close and punch through the soft parts" of the target\'s
armour.  Armour is armour, and it is all equally effective regardless
of facing or location (even the maneuver drive T-plates/HEPlaR ports
are considered armoured under the rules).  Considering that the armour
of such a Capital ship was designed to defend it against powerful PA
spinal mounts, it should be suffice to defend it against fighter
lasers and most missile attacks.

The physics of the situation, regardless of the tech level (TL11-13),
would still make it more effective to simply use massive missile
volleys when combating heavily armed and armoured targets, instead of
more expensive fighters.  Fighters would still be highly useful versus
smaller targets, however, as well as many of the other roles we
typically associate with modern attack aircraft.

I doubt it would take that long (ie: a century) to change space combat
doctrines, especially considering the military actions taking place
around Year 0.  A larger number of missile batteries would probably be
the first steps to match the fighters offensively, followed by an
increased use in laser weaponry for point-defense.

In fiction-- and in Real Life(tm) for that matter-- things could very
much turn out as you describe.  The rules, OTOH, do not allow the
recreation of such a scenario, however (eg: armour penetration).

If rules did exist for variable armour thicknesses, then a group of
fighters could conceivably inflict heavy damage (albeit, at the loss
of many of their fellow pilots).

There are many good home grown systems, some complicated some not.  I
refrain from "awarding" based on "good role-playing".  People who can act
would get all the points.  Not fair.

Basically, I favor the systems where a player "works out" to get strength,
or "practices technique" to get skill levels.  Now this method leaves
somewhat to be desired since I refuse to codify it for the players, but it
basically goes as follows;

Attributes that can be practices or built up (Str, Dex, Edu) may be built
up independently.

Skills that can be practiced in which the character has at least a one
(gun combat, fencing, forgery, computer) may be increased independently.

Skills that require either a major resource (laboratory, library, etc) or
an instructor cannot be increased in the course of an adventure.
Increasing such a skill can be done if the character leaves off
adventuring and enters school, if they qualify, and if they have the funds
or whatever as appropriate.

To increase a skill or attribute which can be increased the character has
to spend *about* 20 hours per week (increased as the level of skill being 
sought increases) for 3 months (12 weeks) or equivalent, within reason.
So they can spend 12 hours a day, 5 days a week (60 hours) for 4 weeks.
Major interuptions are a problem, and if a character is working on a skill
and is interrupted for more than a couple of days (discretionary based on
the skill) I will subtract a week from their tally.

After the requisite period the player rolls the controlling attribute or
less on 1+desired skill level, all ones being auto success, all 6\'s auto
failure.  If the roll fails, his next atempt - 3 months later - is at +1.

So Jack practices to get unarmed melee 3.  After spending 4 hours a day
inand out of jump for three months practicing he rolls against his
strength, which is 9.  He rolls 4 dice (1+ desired skill level 3) trying
for a 9 or less and gets a 13, guess he\'ll be practicing another 12 weeks.

Other Factors;

Instructor with instruction plus skill; Roll one less die for each
instruction level. The instructor can only help up to their level in the
desired skill or instruction, whichever is less.

Factor Zero skills can be taught by anyone with a level 2 or better in the
skill (i.e. instruction not needed), but are earned just like the other
skills above (but note that the "success roll" is one die vs attribute -
usually pretty easy) I usually rule that level zero skills go away if not
utilized regularly (kinda like CPR certification). 

Help from a person without instruction skill will give a +1 to the success
roll if they have one level of skill higher than the desired skill level.

This was determined to be an artificial limitation to starship design.
The rules for TNE and T4 place weapons according to the calculated
surface area of hulls of different displacements and configurations.

As for grouping all of the weapons of a fighter squadron into a single
battery, I do not believe this is possible in any rendition of the
Traveller rules.

With some of the time scales of starship combat, and the ability to see targets 
*much* farther than weapon ranges, there are some remarkable similarities to the
old rag-wagons of the Age of Sail.  I\'ve always considered Traveller starship 
combat much like that if \'feel\'.

Agreed. But what if you have an irregular hull and you scatter things
in oddball places. You seem to be making the assumption that 
spaceships have symmetrical, smooth hulls with no nooks or crannies.
What if you have a planetoid? An unstreamlined, asymmetrical ship?
These configurations means that you can\'t evenly distribute your
sensor arrays and, therefore, that rotating on a single axis won\'t
work.

Part of the above I agree with in Passive sensors should always have a
greater range than active sensors. The part I disagree with is the heat/IR
part, in T4/MT/TNE there has been "handwaving" regarding heat
generation/radiation in spacecraft. If we accept the "Handwaving" regarding
the heat build up then the IR signature of target will not be what it
should be by todays tech. If we do not accept the "Handwaving" then the
entire ship system is truly Pooched. So I for one, have to accept the
"Handwaving" regarding the heat generation/radiation. So with "handwaving"
mode engaged the IR signature will not be as pronounced.

Yes very true, but what about the point when the IR level falls below the
detection threshold of the IR sensor. 

A crude example would be the mark one naked eye looking at the
constellation of Orion, under a cloudless, night under perfect conditions,
the MK 1 would see the pattern of the constellation, but not the many other
stars that you could see the telescope or the Hubble. The mk 1 would
perceive the non detectable stars as blackness.

The distance from the IR source and detection sensor factors into the
ability of the sensors to detect the IR source.

But under daylight conditions using leading edge lights the carge plane
would not detect the approacing palne until it very close. This method was
tested/used during WWII on aircraft searching for Uboats and had a greater
success than most people know about.

Yes this is true but with "handwaving" mode engaged the stealth possiblity
is very available. Ie a "Super Handwaving" mode for IR stealth, using
advanced forms the "Handwaving" method of heat generation/radiation
management.

You don\'t need to develop a new missle type; you design a transport
mechanism to handle the ones you got. This transport mechanism exists: the
System Defense Boat.

I suppose it depends on what you think the Zho\'s can do with 
psionics..I mean I find it plausable to have a psi-enhancement 
technology, (IIRC there is some precedent for a psi/technological 
crossover with psi "flicking" and such) and so the Zho comm techs (at 
least in the Guards) are also telepaths. That would give the Zhodani 
Guard units a hell of an advantage with FTL communications (again 
dependent on your presumptions about psi). A Guard squadron could 
jump insystem, kick ass, and be gone before anyone knew about it.

Of course, we all know the Zho\'s lost the 5th Frontier War (Yaskodray 
only knows how). I\'d assume that this is probably due to the fact 
that the Guard are elite (I mean they are all nobles), and there 
aren\'t too many of them.

The presence of psi-enhancement technology (even at the lower Zhodani 
TL\'s) actually makes the Zho\'s really fearsome. I mean as it stands, 
Zho Guards can teleport into a restricted area behind defenses...they 
can pull tactical secrets out of the Imp admiral\'s head while he 
sleeps, and a telepathic clairvoyant can guide a psionic jump source 
(a la FFS) with pinpoint precision.

And I shudder to think of what a Zho cyberpsi could do on a data 
raid...yuk!

One, a fighter isn\'t any faster in space, period.  Two, it will
never have the same capabilites.  This keep coming up, *sigh*.

Tell that to the pilots.  Look at what kind of losses the US
Airforce could sustain (politically) in a conflict.  The Imperium
should be closer to that mosdel in some ways.  The notion of highly
trained people being expendible doesn\'t wash, IMO.  (and that
doesn\'t even take morale into account)

True enough.  But then why bother bringing the fighter?  Just shoot
the smaller, harder to hit missile.
 
Missiles can (and should be able to) be built to wreak a big ship.
They would typically, IMO, be as big as the fighter you suggest, and
would kill by slamming into the target (warhead being superflous at
a few hundred kms per second).  They might even cost as much as the
fighter, but they would have a (non-expendible) crew member.\\

See above.  BTW, a Tigress has what, 300 laser turrets... based on
calculations done (back of the envelope) on the beta list, once you
get really close, a given laser could hit almost as many targets as
it\'s ROF, so hundreds of missiles or fighters hit per laser
(assuming they are within a few degrees bearing of each other----but
that\'s why you have many lasers).

Only in primitive societies.  It\'s partially a media thing (you see
the war sitting at home) but at least partially the fact that people
in more advanced (technically) societies tend to have fewer children
so they care more if they lose one (there was an interesting article
in the Wilson Quarterly about this a year or so ago).

Only if you assume that for some reason a missile needs to be
carried close to the target.  As it stands, the farther a fighter
can shoot at a warship now, the better (for the fighter).  Fly a
fighter to iron-bombing range against a US CBG and it will be
destroyed, without question.
 
The reason for missiles in modern terms is the frightening prospect

Bzzzzt.  Wrong answer.  You\'re thinking Star Wars.  The g-rating of
the ships drive is how "fast" it is.  Fighters can\'t carry big
drives as easily, so they really aren\'t faster.  Also, in an
absolute sense, they can reach as high a velocity as a BB could.
When your relative velocity to the dust, etc., around you in space
reaches a certain point, your ship will take damage from these
micro-meteorites.  BBs carry orders of magnitude more armor.  The
more armor, the faster you can go.

g-rating is _acceleration_, not velocity.

If the fighter (or anything) gets too much above 1% of c, it\'ll get
shreaded by dust motes.

Not true at all.  A hundred Chinese aircraft could try and take on a
US Carrier Battle Group.  They\'d die, all of \'em (except the ones
that turn tail).  Even if they all carry a couple tac-nukes, they\'d
likely not score a hit.  How many F-14s on CAP for a CBG?
20-something?  That\'s half to all of the attackers dead just from
missile fire.  Any that live deal with the screen, then missiles
haver to also survive the screen.  Not gonna happen.

Aircraft Fighters are (again) not even analogus to space fighters
except that they are small.

Compare:

Aircraft		Space_fighter
- ----		----
Cheap (kinda)		Cheap (kinda)
Faster than ships	Not faster than ships
can sink a ship		Can kill a small ship
ship-like sensors	carries much less capable sensors


The critical point is that they\'re no faster.  The faster nature of
aircraft allowed carriers to have a longer reach than BBs.  This
isn\'t true in space, period.  They project force, but no better than
any other asset in the fleet.

A traveller BatRon has like 2400 fighters, BTW.  They still can\'t
kill a BB.

You assume that a space BB is different than the fighters, it isn\'t.
The only problem it has is that it is a bigger target.

Nope.  a 50 cal bounces off a meter thick slab of armor.  Empty you
magazine at a single point on the hull (bloody hard to do at 10 of
thousands of kms vs. a spinning target) and they have still all
bounced off.  What was your point again?

It could, why not?  the apparent size compared to a BB at much
longer range wouldn\'t be much different at all.  But why bother
since you shoot _one_ fighter with the spinal mount.  Use the
several hundred laser turrets all traveller BBs have.  You could
also use some of the 21,500 ready missiles a Tigress has to nail
fighters (15,500 on a FFS-like version).

You are totally wrong here.  I assume you understand that we\'re
dealing with an effectively frictionless environment.  That means
that you needn\'t run the drives to keep moving.  If you shut off the
drive, you drift forever at your velocity when the drive died.
There is *NO* speed limit save lightspeed (except what you armor
allows vs. dust particles (the BB is faster in this case)). 
 
I think this assumption you make above, which is completely wrong,
is at the bottom of all the other broken assumptions that allow you
to map atmospheric craft to spacecraft.

What about mounting advanced sensors on missilles?  They would be difficult

Agility
Small presented area

To use these to best advantage, fighters would stay as far away from
the target as possible within whatever their effective range is.
Effective range would be their direct fire weapons (lasers) range and
their missiles (determined by the g-rating of the missiles, and
their vector on launch).

If they get too close, evasion makes no difference at all, they get
hit (approaching once per shot fired).  Evasion is the only factor
in space combat that incurs range penalties.  This is why fighters
have uses (aside from close air support in atmosphere).

There will be ranges where the large ships can be easily hit by the
fighter\'s lasers, but the fighters are harder to hit----this is where
they live (if they get to chose) in combat.  They can launch
missiles from there as well, but the missiles have to deal with the
PD fire, etc.  Enough missiles from different angles could satureate
the PD, but ships could do this as well.  The limitless delta v of a
t-plate fighter makes carrying missiles a decent idea.  Just don\'t
put your fighter in range of the BB if you care to go home.

So fighters move towards the enemy, then launch missiles (better
than the fleet sending the coasting from far away).  They can then
brake and stay ahead of the enemy, firing lasers either at enemy
missiles, or to pick away at surface features on the enemy hull that
aren\'t armored.

Correct! The capital ships will change, forcing the \'fighter\' to new
configurations, changing the capital ship .... etc. In M:0, instead of the
fighters presented, the most likely initial figthers were existing hulls
restructured; like the standard scout, only drop off the jump drive, convert
the cargo hold into a missle magazine, and turn every other cubic centimeter
not involved with flight, power or weapons into armor.

nay-sayers on the fighter debate.  I think the arguments about long-range
detection, direct-fire energy weapon point defense, peashooter armament,
heavy armour on the capital ships and absence of a speed advantage for the
fighters means that Lucas-esque small fighters would be stunning wastes of
men and materiel.

	I think that what might be worth investigating is more of a gunboat
concept; stuff a big PA gun, a laser or two, and a sandcaster into the
smallest possible hull (say 200Td or so); this gives it a long-range weapon
with punch enough to give a hard target a hard time, and some defensive
capability.  It minimizes the amount you have to spend on hull, systems,
and crew per big gun.  The idea is to spend the most money possible on
*effective* offensive weaponry and M-drive performance, and sacrifice size,
accomodations, and endurance in order to do so.

	This would be the wet-navy equivalent of mounting a 16" naval gun
as a spinal mount on a boat about 75\' long.  Wouldn\'t work in the water
because of waves & such, but you get the idea; cheaper to build a bunch of
small hulls, power plants, etc, so you get more big guns in the water for
the same amount of money.

	You could use smaller yards to build them in, and you could put
more units out faster than if you were building big suckers.  They\'d be
attrition units, designed for wolfpack tactics.  Any of you SFB players
recall PF\'s?

	As far as the statement in the T4 manual that Fusion+ fighters are
what gives the Third Imperium its edge, let\'s recall that this would
probably be against opponents some TL\'s lower.  Fighters might not be
effective against capital ships, but might be quite effective at commerce
interdiction, generally raising hell, infantry support, terrorizing
civilians, and beating up on lower-TL opponents. They might prove very good
at extending sensor baselines too.  And let\'s not forget that this is
Milieu 0; we don\'t even have rules for building ships over 5,000 Td yet.
So the 100,000 Td dreadnaughts won\'t be a problem right away...

	I don\'t quite buy this one, Ethan... if my neighbours are building
ships with inadequate point defenses, all I\'m going to start doing is
building my ships with many, many missile racks apiece, and nuke my
opponents to bits before they get into spinal mount range with massive
missile waves.

	If there are going to be drones or missiles out there, there are
going to be point defenses... and if there are going to be big spinal
mounts out there, they\'re going to have very heavy point defenses, to keep
their gigacredit investment from being fried by a nuke missle that cost a
few megacredits, tops.  Thus, the fighters get fried when they try and play
with the big boys.

	The more I think about it, the more I think that any admiral
sending fighters in against capital ships would be out of his mind.
Fighters against merchants, fighters against interface fighters, fighters
against ground targets, yes, but not against capital ships...  Now a swarm
of the gunboats I proposed a few posts back against capital ships, yes, but
not fighters...

The same as on Earth (assuming the air itself isn\'t colored, in an otherwise
breathable atmosphere sulfure will generally not formed colored compounds).
However, a thiner atmosphere will mean the blue is darker (tender more
toward the background black of space) and the red will be less intense
(less scattering as the light comes in).

The color of Earth\'s sky depends on scattering and not on chemical adsorption.

How relevant is this to Traveller?  Fighters travel by a diffeent
mode (flight) that gives them and order of magnitude difference in
speed and maneuverability. This isn\'t true in Traveller.  I would
say that a better analogy would be to compare the heavy battleships
and lighter patrol craft of WWI (before naval aviation became
as important).  For reasons similar to Traveller, combat was
staged by larger ships "sluging it out".  Not sending in smaller
craft to attack.

Yep, that\'s exactly my thinking too.  I\'d go a little smaller than the
400sdt SDB, though, down into the 100sdt range.  Send out a squardron with
a few missiles aboard to fire in salvo at long range, then they retire to
their tenders for recovery and resupply.

Like Bruce, I\'ve tried to stay out of a Space Fighters argument, but I
*just* can\'t.  ;-> For all the reasons Bruce, Bob and others have
presented, *fighter* craft are not appropriate for Traveller style space
combat.  This doesn\'t mean we can\'t have some smaller craft though...

As I see it small warcraft in Traveller are much closer to torpedo boats
than fighter planes, if you want an analogy.  They are a little faster
(sometimes), more agile (usually), and without their torpedos little more
than speedboats with machine guns.  Even with their torpedos, torpedo
boats, weren\'t especially effective in attacks on capital ships, unless
they had the advantage of total surprise from darkness or cover.

Now, I think Traveller can give you the torpedos (big missiles that can
damage capital ships), but not the cover.  <G>

How about something like the following:

Parker Class Missile Boat - something like 80 to 100 sdt..crew of 3 to 5. 
Designed to be as fast (best acceleration you can give them) and
maneuverable as possible, have fair sized sensor suites, have a *little*
armor (enough to give them some protection from civilian lasers), armed
with missiles that can damage a capital ship and a couple of low power
lasers for soft targets.  In squadrons, they would launch swarms of
missiles toward a capital ship from *very* *long* range and then run like
hell (still taking loses from covering fire from *destroyers*..that\'s why
they were originally called torpedo boat destroyers.  <g>), and although
most of their missiles would be picked off by point defences they *might*
get a lucky hit and do some damage to a capital ship.  Their main use in
fleet action would be to occupy the escorts for a little while, *maybe*
drawing them off so more capable ships can get their missile swarms past
the escorts and into the capital ships.  We might equip them with
*several* sandcasters and allow them to perform some limited
screening and cover operations as well.

The Missile Boat\'s missions would include:  1.  System patrol; 2. a little
Intellegence gathering and Picket duty; 3.  Commerce
escort/raider duty; and 4. squadron sized missile attacks (probably not too
effective) on capital ships.  IAC, a Missile Boat trying to close with any
*warship* bigger than themselves would be suicide.

These would be short duration/non-jump boats based working out of a tender,
or a base.  I\'d expect these boats to work in groups, seldom alone.

Does anyone want to write up the details? ;->

Ah, the KKM returns, excellent.

 :-)

Actually, even if their use isn\'t always cost effective, since they
*might* be on the enemy\'s load out list, you have no choice but to
build a defense against them.  But I digress.

I used to envision missile bays from HG as big missiles (some guys
use lots of small missiles, some use big fat ones).  A 5-10 ton
unmanned "fighter" with t-plates would be a nasty critter indeed.
You give it as big a g-rating as you can shove into it----perhaps
t-plates as high as possible, then HEPlaR or someting as a booster
for a few g-turns worth.  They might not hit, but if they do...

The knowlege that every enemy fleet has a few of these puppies
warmed up in the launch tubes is enough to make any admiral set up
some good screening around his major units.

I really prefer variability in missile systems, so this is pretty
neat to me.

Regarding fighters and carried missiles, though, I do think there is
reason to use the endless delta v of a missile carrier to set up
missiles on a flight path into the enemy (where they then use their
reaction drives to intercept).  Missile boats probably make more
sense since they minimize crew requirements.  Smaller units
(fighters) might be used in an offensive screening role----since you
can spread out your missiles over a wide patrol area.

In my campaign ships maintain their velocity with respect to the background
stars when they jump. The relative motion between stars is on the order of
tens of km/sec, as I recall. Because of this, when a ship comes out of jump
it may have a large velocity difference between it and its destination. To
offset this, ships in my campaign jump to and from points on the 100
diameter limit where the relative motions counteract each other. For
example, if two systems are moving away from each other the ship will jump
from the trailing point of the origin system and arrive at the leading
point in the destination system. This can save hours of travel and tons of
fuel with HEPlaR drives. Therefore for every jump there is exactly one
departure and one arrival point which is optimal, the "jump point". Pirates
can calculate these points as easily as merchants and wait there for
incoming victims. Merchants in my campaign can decide whether to use the
predictable efficient jump point or a safer but inefficient random jump
point depending on their fears of pirate attack.

As we are opperating in a vaccume where relative drag makes the Drednought

Logical, smart, and it makes sense.  I would tie them in with a combined
force of fighters and TL12 capital ships. So it lets play out the
scenario a little more:

TF 1002 with Admiral Soandso on board, in charge of the traditional
Vilani fleet:=20
4 - 90,000 ton BB=92s=20
6 - 30,000 ton CA=92s
4 - 10,000 ton CL=92s
15 - Escorts in the 3-5000 ton range
20 - Scouts in the 100 - 400 ton range
8 - Supply and Repair ships in reserve

Your mission is to probe the strength of some new up start empire called
Sylena, or some such thing. The fleet jumps in system and starts to
deploy without incident. Big ships towards the center, escorts and
scouts towards the edge, and a few ranging out front. The entire fleet
starts to look like a giant umbrella moving handle first, with scouts at
the curve of the handle. A very traditional approach towards a hostile
system.
=20
Suddenly the scouts start to report small fast moving objects
approaching, and the leading scout goes off line. A few minutes later,
sensors report a large explosion where the scout used to be.

Admiral Soandso does the smart thing, and moves some of the larger
escorts up to support the scouts. Just as the fleet starts to execute
the orders, more and more of the picket scouts start to disappear.=20

Slowly, almost painfully, the fleets eyes and ears are removed. The
fleet is forced to pull in tighter in order to protect the fleet from
these gnats.=20

On the other side the Sylean Fleet controls the time and place of their
attack. Moving in at an angle that provides them the most advantage,
their 2 BB=92s supported by the new fast attack ships, crush most of the
escorting ships. Then, and only then, do they move into the remains of
the Vilani fleet by executing the perfect crossing T maneuver.=20

Weeks later, as the remains of the Vilani fleet return, high command
places full blame on Admiral Soandso, MIA.

Only after they join the Third Imperium do they realize the full extent
of their blunder, and just how lucky they were.

For soon the Zhodani, K=92Kree, Hiver and Vargr will experience the same
results. Only this time the Vilani get to be on the winning side.

Well, here you have hit upon the main point and with good accuracy.  If

the way i see fighters being used in fleet situations is to harras/annoy

than having to wade through everything else to get at them, which is much
the way navy battles have gone throughout history, you don\'t attack a
pocket battleship with a MTB unless you are suicidal, but you can attack
his supply convoy or destroyer escorts with one, denying him his resupply
resources.

as for the comparisons of Aircraft Fighters/Space Fighters to Navy Capital
Ships/Space Capital ships, it is an invalid argument.

Because we are earth bound and so used to surface,submerged and air combat
we forget that they are three entirely seperate mediums.

Subs essentially travel totaly submersed in a Liquid,
Aircraft travel through a gas,
Ships that are on the boarders of the two mediums half in liqued and half
in gas, getting more drag from the the liquid,

in space you are all in the same medium, so when comparing space craft to
navy craft please use vessels using the same medium i.e surface craft or
you have an invalid comparison.

It is neither fine, nor correct. A TL denotes a certain technological
accomplishment. From the start the books used examples from Earth\'s history
as _examples_ of various TLs. Thus TL 4 corresponds, more or less, to what
could be found on Earth between 1860 and 1900. But only more or less. If
you forget that you are apt to get into terrible trouble. For example, IIRC
TL 4 is singleshot weapons, even though there were plenty of magazine
weapons made between 1860 and 1900. And obviously Earth is not TL 9 in
space technology yet, even though TL 9 is supposed to correspone to ca.
1990 to 2000 (OTOH it is my belief that Earth today is considerably above
TL 9 in computer technology).

And then, of course, there are lots of things that _could_ have been done
at a certain time on Earth, but wasn\'t done because the knowledge was
missing. But in the Traveller universe the knowledge IS there. Not, perhaps,
just after the Long Night, but in 1100 every non-interdicted low- and
medium-tech world in the Imperium has access to full TL 15 knowledge. So
drawing parallels between what technology was used on Earth during a
particular historical period and what can be done on a planet with the
"corresponding" TL is difficult and at best a guideline. At worst it leads
to silly mistakes.

Try to get hold of the Megatraveller book _Referee\'s Companion_. It has a
big chart with details of a dozen different technological fields set out
level by level.

The canonical answer is that the RoM (which included the Vilani at the time)
made it to TL 12 (Vland slipped to 9 during the Long Night, but began
climbing again when contacted by the Sylean Confederation in (I think) -450).

The big problem (apart from writers who apparently don\'t give a damn about
maintaining consistency) is that there is no definition of just what it
means that a world or a culture has a particular TL. My own (personal)
definition is that a world is TL X when 90% or more of it\'s inhabitants
routinely use TL X implements and that an interstellar culture is TL X
when one or more of it\'s major worlds are TL X.

I\'ve reluctantly come to the conclusion that the knowledge of the early
Imperium is apparently TL 14 or thereabouts. Reluctantly, because it opens
up a whole truckload of worm cans. Why did the central world of a multi-
sector empire lack the economic strength to advance from TL 12 to 13 in
less than 3 centuries? (The Imperium dosen\'t reach TL 13 till 300). The
Imperium will almost certainly have a few jump-4 or even jump-5 couriers
(costing a fortune, yes, but can you imagine how useful they would be?).
And why did it take 1000 years or so to advance two TLs in knowledge? (In
1105 there are aspects of the Darrian TL 16 technology that is still not 
understood* (which is strange in itself when Vincennes later turned out to
be mature TL 16 approaching TL 17).

I agree that someone ought to decide the definite answer to the whole
question of technolgy, both knowledge and application, across the
Traveller timeline, and the only one who can do that is Marc Miller,
since there is no way to resolve all the contradictions involved without 
violating several part of the canon.

*And how DID the Darrians manage to lose their TL 16 knowledge when one
 entire university survived the _Maghiz_ intact? Sigh...

     **Leader article**

The highlight of the ISBA\'s recent activities was of course, His Serene
Highness, Emperor Cleon\'s suprise arrival and speach at the ISBA
inaugurial dinner. The ISBA\'s foundation was greatly honoured by his
attendance. A full text of his speach is reproduced below.

"Welcome. I am pleased to be here....tonight, both personally and
professionally. You all know Zhunette (a gesture to the left) and of her
work with those in need. And you should all know James (a gesture to the
back of the room) who has been so helpful with the promulgation of the
calendar."

"Although these events are never informal, I want to speak with you
tonight not as Emperor, but as a man. And I would hope that my words
would have the same force no matter what. We are in the process of
building a great empire... an interstellar government that will have a
greater span than any that has come before. The future we face
stretches out a thousand years or more, and we will not see an end to
it in our children\'s children\'s lifetimes."

"But our future is bright. We have made a major stride forward with the
Fusion Plus system, and I expect in the near future to see similar
strides with Jump Doubler and G Restraints. We stand on the threshold
of a vast new frontier."

"And that frontier presents problems that will inevitably stand in our
way. We can solve each of the physical problems, but what continues to
trouble me is the fact that each of us here is human. Our empire must,
if it is to survive, embrace each intelligence that resides in it, and
if necessary make special provision to bring each intelligence to its
greatest possible level of achievement."

"We have an opportunity now to sweep away the prejudices of the past,
and we must make that a goal as much as our goal of expanding
territoriality."

"David {Baron David Colsworth, Maximus Interstellar Industries}, think of
how much more marketable your products would be if they standardized
controls for the major ergonomic forms in the marketplace."

"And Mallard {Sir Ira Rimmer ,Bureau Of Starships Safety, Health, and
Transit Standards}, if more of your people were locals, wouldn\'t they
understand better the needs of the locals in terms of safety and health."

"Our empire must be eclectic and cosmopolitan, embracing everyone it
meets, absorbing them under an umbrella that protects and enhances
them. The safety and security that we create will give us and our
children\'s children the opportunity to live out our lives in peace and
prosperity."

"Remember that both the Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man collapsed from
their own shortcomings. We must not allow that to happen again."

"I thank you all for being here tonight, and although I must leave, ask
you to embrace this philosophy of empire and make it a reality."

His Serene Highness took the opportunity to introduce Duchess Zhunette
Rosale Cardell, the Emperors offical Liaison to the ISBA.

     **News**

024-20: Klan Sorien Trust LIC announced today its intention to make a
substantial investment in Valipro Yards LIC. Currently only capable of
constructing ships of up to 500 Td, Valeizro intends to upgrade it\'s
capacity to enable the construction of ships of up to 2000 Td. Count
Sorien (President of Klan Sorien Trust) was quoted as saying "This is an
investment in the future of the shipbuilding industry. Klan Sorien see\'s
major long term opportunities in this field. With the current growth in
interstellar trade it is only a matter of time before existing facilities
become inadequate. This partnership with Valeizro is but the first step in
what we hope will be a major focus of our activities" Valeizro stock rose
5 points on the Sylean exchange in response to this announcement.

045-20: The Imperial Navy announced today its intention to procure a class
of ten long range commerce cruisers of a new design. It is intended that
the prototype will be produced at the Sylean Imperial Navy Yards. However
it is expected that, as per standard practice, contracts subsequent examples
will be let to suitably qualified private yards. Whilst the design is
apparently well advanced, the Imperial Navy\'s Bureau of Contruction and
Repair (BuConRep) is remaining tight lipped as to the final specifications.
All that has currently been released is that the class will be in the
20,000 to 30,000 Td range with a good endurance and heavy armarment.

061-20: BSSHTS investigations continue into the tragic loss of the Tukera
liner "Granier". Lost on her maiden voyage on 321-19, the Granier was a
prototype high capacity liner incorporating several new technologies built
by Vossin Craftwerke AG. Whilst no firm details have been made public
regarding her loss, informed sources indicate that current investigations
are focussing on certain aspects of her revolutionary low volume thruster
plates produced by Zimm Gravitics LIC. Officals at Zimm declined to comment
on such speculations, stating only that any comment would have to await the
offical report of the Board of Investigation.

072-20: The shipbuilding industry mourned the death of Baroness Drena Von
Rankle today. Baroness Von Rankle was a leading naval architect, noted for
her inovative small craft designs. Active until she was striken by illness
in the middle of last year; Baroness Von Rankle is survived by her son Mark
and daughters Erika and Mia. It is expected that Baroness Erika will take
over the reigns of the Von Rankle design bureau.

086-20: X-TEK inc. today announced that it was beginning preliminary design
work on a new line of fighters. Apparently a speculative design, the new
designs are intended to suppliment rather than replace the models currently
in service. While X-TEK has release no offical specifications, company
officals have privately stated that the designs will incorporate several new
technologies and inovative design practices. BuConRep declined to make any
offical comment, but many senior fighter commanders are believed to have
shown interest in the project. Lt Cmdr Gam Luushem, commander of the elite
97th Naval Fighter Squadron stated "X-TEK produce some of the best high
performance small craft in the Imperium, I for one will be very interested
to see what the Commander is producing. If it\'s anything like X-TEK\'s
previous designs, I\'d be happy to see the men and women in my squadron
behind the controls".

094-20: X-TEK inc. and Maximus Interstellar Defence Industries (MIDI) have
announced an agreement for X-TEK to fit MIDI\'s new CDVX-22 missile system to
several of its designs, including the AB-1A Assault Bomber and the Missile
SDB currently in the design stages. This new missile system will offer
significantly increased capacities for the X-TEK craft. Many analyists
predict that the CDVX-22 will also form the main armarment of the new line
of fighters currently in the works from X-TEK. It is believed that X-TEK
intends to commence licenced productio of the CDVX-22 in the near future,
with MIDI recieving access to several advanced X-TEK high energy weapon
systems in return.

Notes

     Catullus Aerospace presents its first quasi-military starship. The
\'Greek Fire\' class Mercenary Cruiser is designed to meet the needs of the
Imperial contracted mercenary group or corporate security organisation. We
would also be delighted to assist any planetary governments in discussing
how a contingent of \'Greek Fire\' class ships could assist in fulfilling
their local security and rapid military deployment requirements.
     Armed with 4 of the latest, and most powerful yet, Sylea Industry
approved heavy laser turrets, alongside 4 standard heavy missile turrets, a
\'Greek Fire\' class starship is your company\'s ace in the hole for that hot
drop into hostile territory. You need no longer hope that a decent
percentage of your lightly armed shuttles, or temperamental drop capsules,
arrive safely. Now the fire support for your elite shock troops can come
with them all in one package.
     With these advanced weapons systems and the provision of 4 of the
recently released \'Guard\' type sandcasters, your \'Greek Fire\' starships can
also be used for anti-pirate operations such as base attacks or
neutralisation and boarding operations. The advanced communications suite
also allows its use as an orbital support and command platform, or even for
control of an orbit against a non-military opponent.
     Each \'Greek Fire\' ship is capable of carring up to 40 troops. This
includes provision for a planning room for the troop and shared large
quarters for every two soldiers. This means that your troops arrive in prime
condition and preperation for the upcoming battle. Support facilities
include a full medical bay allowing for immediate treatment in safe
conditions of any casualties.
     Separate large staterooms are provided for the Captain and First
Officer of the ship. All other crew are accomodated two to a large stateroom. 
     For wilderness operation, or in a hostile location, fuel scoops have
been provided which will fill the ships\' fuel tanks in a single hour, giving
you maximum flexibility. The scooped fuel can then be refined in 10 hours.
     Two Modular Cutters are provided to increase the flexibility of the
Mercenary Cruiser. These allow the despatch of negotiation teams, orbital
surveillance of multiple locations, and rapid dropoff and pickup
capabilities. Details of these modular cutters are shown below.

The modular cutter below is a design by Antti Lahtinen <lahtinen@ee.tut.fi>,
which was posted to the TML in February, 1997.

Modular Cutter: The Modular Cutter is a multi-purpose cargo vehicle which
can be fitted with a variety of 30-ton (420 m3) modules. The outer shell of
the cutter\'s mid part open as a large cargo hatch, and a module is attached
to the cutter\'s spine between the cockpit and engine. The cargo hold has
lighter armor that the rest of the cutter (AV 20, Armor 10), but counts as
normal armor (AV 40, Armor 20) when a cargo module is carried internally.
The cutter has build-in fuel scoops which are used only when a fuel module
is or flexible 30 DT fuel bladder is fitted in the cargo hold. The external
dimensions of cargo modules are 4.60 x 25.26 m.

     **Biography**

Duchess Zhunette Rosale Cardell (nee Zhunastu)
Born: 024 - -16

Duchess Cardell is the neice of Emperor Cleon, and has been appointed as
his official liaison with the ISBA.

A graduate of the prestigous Armash University, she studied criminology and
earned a Master of Science in criminal psychology. The Duchess Cardell
married Corlon Cardell (son of the ruling family of the Shaglaath Empire)
in 0002. The couple settled on Sylea, where they became leading members of
the court social circuit, seen at many state functions. Corlon continued his
passion for grav racing, becoming a frequent sight at the Sylean Grand Prix
and many similiar sporting events. Regretably Duchess Cardell\'s charitable
works prevented her from joining her husband at many of these events.

The couple remained devoted to each other and their two children Corlon Jnr
(18) and Talin (16). However after 18 years of marriage their union was ended
by Corlon\'s tragic death in a grav racing accident 5 months ago. The Duchess
was reportedly devestated by her husbands death and was not seen in public
for several months after the event.

The Duchess is noted for her extensive charity work. Despite the pressures
on her time, she is a tireless worker for the education and care of Sylea\'s
underprivileged youths and is Patron of The Imperial Youth Hope Fund; as well
as being a member of the board of trustee\'s of several leading charities;
including the Emperor\'s Children and Mothers Trust and the Khargiip
Foundation. In 15 Emperor Cleon personally presented her with the Shield of
Hope award for her work with the underprivileged.

Thanks for raising a different topic from the (yawn!) thread on fighters  
clogging the TML at the moment. I really enjoy putting in little 
details like colour of sky, strength of wind, feel of gravity and so on 
to add authenticity. IMO, this is something the players will experience on 
*every* planetfall, whereas chitchat about the advantages of fighters in 
space combat will almost never be of any use. 

Back to the topic: 
Somebody stated that the taint won\'t have any effect on the colour of the 
sky, and this is correct for sulphur compounds. However, other taints 
like dust, smoke and so on will turn the sunlight a distinctive shade 
of yellow (if you\'ve ever been near a bushfire you\'ll know what I\'m 
talking about); if the atmosphere is tainted with sulphur, it 
is a fair bet that there is a lot of volcanic activity - and 
volcanoes don\'t just belch out \'colourless sulphur dioxide\'!

Our sky is blue because our sunlight is scattered, but I don\'t know if 
different coloured sunlight (ie different star) would scatter 
differently - thus leading to a strangely coloured sky? 

Also, I\'m not sure, but I think a chlorine taint might make the sky 
greenish.

    'body' => 'Greetings, 
I have noticed that many of you on TML have considered the design of 100
or 200Td vessels that cary a large main weapon and perhaps some
missiles.  Hate to break it to y\'all but...

Been there, done that.

The first thing i designed with QSDS was the Assault Scout. It was
designed to be basicaly a fighter with j-drive.  I took the basic
Scout/Courier, added 6g plates and mounted a Military Laser (for the
+4FC mod).  These babies rock.  I have done combat scenarios with a
small squad of these things against small capitals around 2000Td and
less and found how effective they were.  Not bad, they gave the
destoryer a run for its money, but the destoryer managed to disable a
few with missiles and lasers.  Mind you I only threw 5 Assault Scouts at
the thing, more of these scouts could prolly disable or destory it.

The Assault Bomber design added 2 Missile barbettes.  It\'s cool to see
capitals waste lasers on missiles, so that when the Scouts come in the
capital has nothing left to fire on them with.

My question is, If i could build these things, whats to keep the Pocket
empires from building them? In my experience i find these mose effective
than fighters.  Jump capable, dont need smaller senors, and about 10x
the room to put stuff in.

I will contine building fighters just to see what can be done with a
small hull. :)

Don\'t forget that the "entry points" are more than a little spread out.
You can\'t pick a spot and jump to it, only sort of close to it. (I\'m
going to have to collect all the rules about jump accuracy and see what
I can find).

Trouble is, you *can\'t* "jam" IR. Well you can put out "flares", but
sensors can easily ignore ones that aren\'t radiating at the "right"
wavelengths/intensities.

Sorry, but you are wrong. Water, people, beer, etc *all* have *more*
Hydrogen per unit *volume* than LH2!

Work it out. A cubic meter of water weighs 1 ton. One ninth of that is
hydrogen. So that gives 111 kilos per cubic meter. Or 1556 kilos per
displacement ton. 

Trouble is, each passenger is a lot *less* than a cubic meter. 10 tons
of hydrogen would take around 100 passengers.

I think so. 

Since a fighter is essentially the *only* vessel that can run at a
higher acceleration than the g-comps can nuetralize, it does have the
ability to do things you can\'t do with larger vessels. 

They make good scout/recon ships simply because they are small enough
to give a small signature (even on IR), and they can outrun pursuit. 

So they are good gor checking out that target that looks to be a meteor
on sensors, or for dropping that agent somewhere (if they have the
range). 

They are also useful against lightly armed and armored merchant
vessels.

Sunset will definitely be red. That\'s due to absorportion and the like.

But I think you are going to run into a situation like Mars. Sulfur
compounds in the air tend to abosorb blue light *very* strongly. They
also tend to form fine aerosols. Which will act like the dust in Mars\'
very thin atmosphere. 

So the daylight sky will be *pink*!

I like to think about some of the "Notices to Space Pilots" for

Sorry, but this is *two* (or more!) tables jammed together.

Please note that ranges 1 thru 6* are using steps of 3+ per level (step
of x3, every other step is x10 of the one 2 before it).

The 7 thru 11 ranges use steps of x10. 

Therefore, these *aren\'t* the same table because they scale differently!

My post the other day shows what you get with a scaling factor of 3+
per step all the way up to parsec. That was, I trust, overkill?

Factor of 10 is just fine for space (and most other things). Heck, it\'s
silly to use those factor of 3 steps on some of the other things.

Remember, in space, the *only*  thing affecting signal strength is the
inverse square law. No atmospheric absorption to worry about. 

So all the RF that leaks from ships, all the neutrino emissions, the
"glow" of the drive, the IR radiated by the various sections of the
ship. It\'s all there to be picked up. 

And the IR is the biggy. The background is interstellar space. At 3
degrees Kelvin. Humans and anything at a comfortable temp for them
radiate around 300K. The waste heat from the powerplant, drives, etc
has to be radiated from the ship or the ship will get hotter until it
*is* radiated as fast as it\'s created. You can\'t "mask" the IR.
Attempting to redirect it to limited areas of the hull uses *lots* of
energy, resulting in an overall signal that is *stronger*. 

And heck, just sunlight heating the hull will make a decent signal. 

Gimme a ship, and some Schmidt cameras (a type of telescope) set up for
work in the appropriate IR bands and I\'ll have every ship in transit in
a system located in a matter of hours. Due to the extra "noise" around
planets it\'ll take a few days to spot the stuff in orbits. Then I can
jump out from my vantage point (near system zenith or nadir and *well*
out from the ecliptic) long before anybody gets there.

You need a course in physics. 

In space, objects in motion *keep* moving. If you fire your engines, it
changes your vector (speed and or direction). Your "top speed" is
solely a matter of how *long* you can maintain acceleration. 

Velocity = Acceleration * Time

So a ship that can accelerate at 6g for 10 minutes, and one that can
accelerate at 1 g for 60 minutes both have the same "top speed". And
they\'ll both have to be rescueed if they reach it, because they will
have used all their fuel to reach it and thus can\'t slow down!

The ship that can accelerate at 6 g will reach a given speed *faster*
than the one that can only do 1 g. But these two ships can both reach
the same speeds. 

But if two ships both have a maximum *acceleration* of 6g, then neither
*regardless of size* can reach a given speed "faster" than the other.
If one has the fuel to accelerate at 6g *longer* than the other, then
it can reach a higher speed.

Why aren\'t the anti-missile lasers taking out the fighters? After all,
even without fusion+, I can build 500 ton MIRVs. Carry a ridiculous
number of missiles, get into the range where the lasers are just
starting to be a threat, and then disgorge a few hundred Sprint
missiles or the like (the Sprint would list in trav terms as something
like 500g for 30 seconds). And the "bus" would bore on in too. It\'d be
dangerous just from the mass!

Betcha it doesn\'t last more than 5-10 *years* at any given place. But
as long as they can keep fusion+ a secret from the folks thy are
*fighting*, they *can\'t* refit, because they can\'t build it. 

Sure, knowing that it\'s *possible, the more flexible cultures may
actually discover it before their war is over. But likely not in time
to make a difference.

The problem is that to hurt the "battleship" they have to *hit* it or
at least get within not all that many km of it. 

But the lasers and PAWs on the battleship can detect and target the
fighters and missiles at 30,000 km! In fact, at that range, they have
essentially *no* chance of closing unless there are enough of them to
overwhelm the fire control. Which is very unlikely (it\'d take
*thousands*). 

Also, your "waves" idea doesn\'t work in space combat. The ships are
moving so fast that if a fighter did a "close pass" it could take it
*hours* to be able get back to its carrier. 

> Armour is a measure of endurance in these sort of battles, not a guarntee

Yes, but the beam weapons make missiles and fighters next to useless.
Unlike WWII, these are going to hit what they shoot at. Every time. The
only defence is to be far enough away that your evasive manuevers can
cause the beam to miss. That means several light seconds. That\'s
several times the distance to the *moon*.

Sorry, it\'s 100% plausible. There *aren\'t* any counter-measures against
a laser of the power we are talking about except to not be where it is
aimed. And *that* requires being far enough out that speed of light lag
prevents the computer from changing where the beam is aimed faster than
you can dodge.

Consider. In one second, with a 6g drive, you can change your position
from your predicted position by 60 meters. Assuming that your fighter
is only *10* meters across, that\'s 6 diameters. So at 1/2 a light
second, you are safe because the light/radar/whatever signal that
bounced off your fighter took 1/2 a second to get to the enemy, and the
return laser shot takes 1/2 second to come back (plus a few
milliseconds for calculating and aiming). So by the time it gets there
you are 60 meters away.

Now try this at .1 light seconds. The lag is .2 seconds. In that time
you can only move 2.4 meters with a 6g drive. That\'s a lot less than
the 10 meters across that your fighter is. So the shot aimed "dead
center" hits a couple meters to the side. You\'ve still been hit.

Note that .1 light second is 30,000 kilometers!

And yes, the lasers *can* change aiming point that fast. All they have
to do is swivel a mirror a tiny bit.

It\'s not that the agility works against them, it\'s that the shorter the
range the shorter the "time of flight" of the laser beam. The agility
is *irrelevant* at closer ranges.

Sorry, but lasers make closing with an enemy ship *suicide*.

Because they can no longer avoid being hit if they close with the
enemy. Lasers and modern tracking make that *certain*.

In traveller, your 500 fighters are going to be starting from hundreds
of thousands of km away. Consider a fighter that survives to launch a
missile at the .1 light second range. It\'s still got to cross 30,000
km. In plain sight, with the exhaust plume backlighting it every time
it makes a course change. And with the lasers getting *more* accurate
every meter of the way. And the effectiveness of dodging dropping every
meter of the way.

	Sure, it wouldn\'t matter for combat targetting. But it\'ll make it
difficult to board, because you CAN\'T perfectly match my course if I\'m
changing. And that was the whole point of the discussion (see the Subject:
Boarding Action). As long as I can rotate or translate my ship, it\'s going
to make it harder for anybody to latch on. Not impossible, depending on how
much linear/rotational acceleration I can put out. But harder.

	Sorry, learn basic physics. YOU have an incorrect assumption. Top speed on
Earth is limited by drag and friction effects. At the point where drag
equals thrust, you can\'t go any faster.

	 Drag and friction are negligible in an environment where you have a
single atom per cubic METER! The effective top limits on speed in space are
solely how long you can thrust your drive. Period. Dot. The theoretical
limit remains the speed of light.

	Yep. As well as T4. But that applies to both battleships and fighters.
Again, the only limitation on maximum acceleration is how much the crew can
handle. And don\'t try to handwave about how fighter pilots are better
positioned to handle G-stress. Any naval designer who can\'t design a
battleship with the acceleration properly directed to allow a battleship
crew to sit in the same kind of seats as the fighter crew, and hence handle
the same acceleration, is a submoronic cretin.

	So, the ONLY advantage small vessels have over large vessels is the
ability to change direction faster. Big vessels have the advantage of armor
that can be invulnerable to small weapons, they can carry defenses such as
nuclear dampers and sandcasters, they can carry sufficient weapons to fry
fighters in a single shot (a single 800ROF laser can kill 800 fighters in a
single turn), they can carry sensors that can detect and target fighters at
greater ranges, etc.

	So fighters just don\'t make sense as the "king of the battlefield" in
Traveller. They play a supporting role, as scouts, commerce raiders,
pickets, etc. No more. Any admiral who tries to use fighters against
capital ships is as moronic as the naval designer I mentioned above.

	The only way to make fighters into the glorious toys you want is to
completely and totally rewrite all of the Traveller space combat and design
rules, ignoring the SCIENCE in SCIENCE fiction. If I wanted to play space
fantasy, I\'d play Star Wars anyway.

	Why? Yes, I can\'t run my 500,000Dt battleship at 3G over GComp for weeks.
But the fighter can\'t do that either, because it doesn\'t have the endurance.

	Any naval designer worth the designation will design warships with the
thrust vector aligned properly and acceleration couches for the entire
crew. So I can\'t do damage control while running at 3G excess. Neither can
the "fighter."

	Given that I _can_ run a properly designed warship of any size at excess
G\'s, this kind of falls out.

No you don\'t "Jam"  IR, you "Mask" it.  At least that is what we do 
at TL8.

Everyone seems to forget, once you make a tech advance in one area, 
someone comes up with a counter or a counter counter measure to 
negate or limit the benefits of the advance.

Just because the limited ship combat systems for traveller don\'t 
address it doesn\'t mean that there wouldn\'t be ECM and ECCM to help 
ships avoid detection at higher tech levels.

Of course.  The same holds true for Imperial Battlerider squadrons.
It is just that some people are arguing the (better) cost
effectiveness of fighters, yet forget to mention the manditory carrier
or base.

Excuse me, but I think the war was still raging during "the last few

Your definition as to when the "war" officially started and ended is
amusing, especially since you acknowledge attacks that take place both
before and after.  I believe James Gariss\'s reply was accurate, based
on the content of your original post.

My understanding, based on conversations with my German partner and my German legal 
intern, is that the normal career path is like this:  Age 18, finish Gymnasium (i.e., 
high school); ages 18-20, mandatory military service; age 20, begin law school; age 25 
or so, take written exam; during that same time, get a position as a Referendar with a 
law firm, corporate legal department, court, or some other practical legal setting; 
after that, take oral exam.  At about age 26, having passed both exams and completed a 
3-month Referendar program, you\'re allowed to practice law.  

One interesting distinction between the common law and civil law systems, which is 
reflected in legal education, is the position of the judge.  Usually, judges in a common 
law jurisdictions have been civil litigators or criminal lawyers (usually prosecutors) 
for twenty years (or a long time, anyway) and are appointed (or, depending on the place 
and the level of the judge, elected) by the executive branch.  The position of judge is 
very prestigious, they have a lot of authority and discretion, and they serve as a 
neutral regulator and manager of the litigation process.  

In civil law systems, on the other hand, a law student can specialize in judging, and 
can get a civil service job as a judge right out of law school.  Judges don\'t have the 
same prestige as in common law countries, and act in court much more as a representative 
of the state than as a neutral figure.

I expect that Imperial and local courts will be eclectic on this issue.  I haven\'t 
decided whether the Terrans carried more of a civil law or a common law tradition into 
space; probably it was mixed, and the resulting judiciary is mixed by the time of the 
Third Imperium.

I had many law professors who had LL.M.s that they had received from

This was my point from the beginning. That\'s why you (as the pirate)
want either the computer/pilot or power plant disabled. That way
the steering jets aren\'t working.

    'body' => 'To continue the thread of why fighters should be effective, there
  are some important things to consider:

  1.  Just because the time consumed in one game turn is 10 minutes,
      doesn\'t mean that characters are only performing actions which
      last for 10 minutes.  If a ship manages to board another, and
      you end up trying to conduct combat simultaneously on the two
      scales, it is entirely possible that the entire boarding action
      will be finished in one or two starship combat turns.

  2.  What I\'ve always wondered about is why there isn\'t a spinal version
      of the laser turret for ships which are manuverable to to use it.
      After all, the weapon systems and propulsion systems on a fighter
      are going to be the primary consumers of space and mass, so it
      shouldn\'t be a big concern to the fighter pilot if he has to 
      shoot in the direction he\'s moving.  Of course I\'m assuming that the
      extra benefit of the spinal style laser weapons would be increased
      damage potential.

      I mean, if your in a 10 ton fighter, you really don\'t care about
      having a weapon which can rotate to fire, simply because you should
      be able to turn your ship around and shoot back fairly easily
      (or possibly even just do a 180 and bring your weapon to bear).

      Does anyone know if FF&S or any of the more recent ship design
      systems support this idea?

  3.  Its been awhile since I\'ve played a starship combat, but given
      the relatively large defensive DMs for the TL15 fighter in
      the MegaTraveller naval book (I forget the name, but its the one
      with all the capital ships in it), the fighters should be fairly
      survivable.

  4.  Maybe I\'ve just been watching Babylon 5 and other shows too often,
      but it seems to me that a small carrier with 5 to 10 fighters
      should be more effective than the equivalent SDB in performing routine
      patrols.  Especially if your concern is mostly with dealing with
      smaller ship (i.e. 500 tons or less).

      Then again, the approach to fighter carriers which don\'t have
      internal landing bays would be maybe cheap enough to allow effective
      fighter carriers too.

Either way, I haven\'t played around with the combat system enough to know
  for sure, but I would assume its the same as for BattleTech the last
  time I played, that the smaller ships should be just as effective together
  as the big ships, given the right tactics.

Clinton has ordered such cruise missile attacks during his first

True :-)  I guess it would be better put "the first actions of the
war were..."  Still, there were special ops that happened before the

There is.  It\'s been named (in TNE) the "laser lance."  In CT it was
just a laser without the turret.

Unfortunately, the design rules for lasers in FFS (the basis for
SSDS and QSDS) has a very small penalty for the steering glop for a
laser.  As a result, non-steerable lasers are kinda pointless.

I have played spinal weapons such that they has a bad modifier on
attacks made while their own ship is evading.  Assuming the concept
of Agility is added to a better combat system, you might subtract
Agility from your evasion Gs and use that as a - DM on the to-hit
task.  That way more agile ships are better with a spinal mount
(then trow a PAW on a large-ish "fighter."  :-)

Bingo! This is what I envision Cleon\'s designers doing. Taking an existing
hull, using the newer Fusion+ power plants to release space for expanded
weapons and sensor suites.

Now, how much bigger a punch could you pack into this baby if you assumed
the crew was only on board for 18-36 hours, max, at a time?

Yes that the one the three type of IR electronic warfare that we have
today. Go look in Janes All The Worlds Aircraft, you should find a rather
large section covering EW gear on aircraft, alot of the gear specifically
deals with IR EW pods.

Another good rule is if it can be detected or emitted it can subject to EW.
Just because you don\'t believe it is possible to EW IR, does not make it so.

Yes very true that has always been a leak point in traveller, the real
winner in high tech military vehicle engagements is the one that has the
EW/ECCM edge.

Someone good at game-design help me out.  Isn\'t the answer to "why bring
the fighter" *oney*?  I would think missiles consume some sort of fuel.
The farther away the missiles are fired, the more fuel they need, the
greater their comm requirements (or the better their sensors have to be),
and the bigger their housing.  All of these cost money.  Right?

I\'m not disagreeing, just curious.  Why is the game designed such that
smaller ships (ie fighters) carry "much less capable sensors"?

	Yes. There\'s no real reason you can\'t have a large fixed laser. However,
there are limits on the maximum power of lasers.

	Most of the discussion against fighters has been based on ab-initio
analysis, done by people with some impressive technical knowledge to back
them up. Irregardless of what MT said, there are two points that kill
fighters:

	- You really can\'t hide a fighters. Even now, NORAD admits to being able
to track MARBLE sized objects between here and the moon. That\'s just what
they admit to. Now you throw in the power plant, and the drive, and you
cannot hide a fighter. The big ship will see you.

	- Lasers are highly accuracte lightspeed weapons. If the big ship sees
you, it will hit you, especially once you get within a few lightseconds.
Big ships carry big lasers, so a hit is a kill. See the previous bullet
about sensors.

	Again, trying to analyze the physics of space combat based on either TV
shows, or old WWII movies will completely mislead you. Those TV shows were
created to show off the special effects wizards capabilities, and the guys
writing the scripts watched old WWII movies too. Babylon-5 style fighters
in Traveller would require immensely more powerful weapons available to
small ships.

	You can, of course, create a combat system that ignores physics. In that
combat system you can set it up so that fighters can take on big ships. But
if I\'m going to play fantasy, I\'ll play with elves and magic. When I\'m
playing science fiction, I do want science to be considered.

    'body' => 'I thought I\'d give those people on the list-- that aren\'t involved in
the Fighters vs. Capital Ships discussions over on TML-- something
else to digest for a change :)

I picked up the new Babylon 5 RPG the other day and thought it might
be interesting to share the task system used in "The Babylon Project"
(or "TBP").

There are a number of similarities between the T4 and TBP task
systems.  Both systems use six-sided dice (TBP using only two dice),
both use an "Attribute + Skill" method of determining character
ability, and both use different levels of difficulty (TBP uses target
numbers instead of T4\'s variable-number-of-dice).  Both systems have
the ability to determine critical successes or failures, and TBP goes
the extra distance by offering multiple levels of success or failure
(including "criticals").  TBP also offers two additional task results
that are not *directly* linked to the attempted task at hand.  I will
try to explain.

Like T4, TBP uses "Attribute + Skill" to determine the general
competence of each skill posession by the character.  The result of
the sum is known in TBP as that character\'s "Ability" at that task.
TBP uses attributes that range from 1 to 9, and skills that range from
0 to 5 (characters can also have one or more skill "Specialties",
which give a further bonus of +2 to that skill).  All skills have
recommended attributes with which they are considered most
appropriately associated (these associations are not written in stone,
however).  Regardless of whether you play T4 using "Attribute +
Skill", "Attribute + (Skill x 3)", or whatever, the similarity between
the two task systems will become obvious in a moment.  This fact also
allows easy conversion to Traveller, regardless of which (un)official
task system you are now using.

TBP uses multiple levels of difficulty, just like T4.  Instead of
declaring a variable number of dice to be rolled at each difficulty
level, however, TBP uses fixed numerical target numbers as follows:

  Difficulty        Target
    Rating          Number
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D
Trivial                2
Easy                   3
Basic                  5
Average                7
Tricky                 9
Difficult             11
Very Difficult        15
Next to Impossible    17
Miraculous            25

This list can easily be toned down to six entries for T4.  The high
number of defined difficulty ratings is necessary for TBP\'s ranged
combat rules (and possibly others that I haven\'t read yet :)  During
contested skills between two individuals (such as an arm wrestling
match) don\'t bother assigning a Difficulty Rating.  Instead, simply
have everyone involved make a roll, with the one rolling highest
declared the winner.  TBP has additional rules for team work and
complex/time consuming tasks but I won\'t get into those rules.

The character\'s "Ability" is then modified using what TBP calls a
"Random Modifier" (ranging from -5 to +5) as follows...

Each player has two six-sided dice of different colours.  Once die is
considered "Positive" (traditionally green) while the other is
"Negative" (traditionally red).  Both are rolled together, and the die
with the _lower_face_value_ becomes the "Random Modifier".

=46or example: a Positive "6" and a Negative "2" would result in a
Random Modifier of -2, while a Positive "1" and a Negative "2" would
result in a Random Modifier of +1.  Identical die results generate a
Random Modifier of 0 (exception: "box cars" or "snake eyes" are
considered unique results-- "Benefits" and "Setbacks", respectively).

The final total-- Attribute + Skill + Specialty (if applicable) +
Random Modifier-- is then compared to the assigned Difficulty Rating
on following chart:

"Ability" Test Result     Degree of Sucess/Failure
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
roll failed by 6 or more    Critical Failure
roll failed by 4 or 5       Significant Failure
roll failed by 2 or 3       Normal Failure
roll failed by 1            Marginal Failure
roll made by 0 or 1         Marginal Success
roll made by 2 or 3         Normal Success
roll made by 4 or 5         Significant Success
roll made by 6 or more      Critical Success

These degrees of success or failure have rough guidelines for a TBP
referee to follow, but they can easily be reduced to a simple "roll
failed by 5" or "roll made by 5" result to represent Critical Failures
or Successes in Traveller.

The "box cars" and "snake-eyes" results that I mentioned earlier are
used in TBP to represent unpredictable events-- not DIRECTLY related
to the actual task test-- that might "benefit" or "set back" the
character performing the task.  Since these two dice results are still
treated as a Random Modifier of "0", a Setback result could still be a
success (and vice versa).

=46or example: a character attempting to pick a mechanical lock could
normally roll a Critical Success or Failure using any of the T4 task
system rules, resulting in the lock being picked far faster than
normal or possibly being damaged, depending on the Critical result.
In TBP, a Benefit result ("box cars") might indicate the inadvertent
discovery of a key under the doormat, while a Setback ("snake eyes")
could represent a local security guard that just happened to arrive on
the scene.  These could be considered "optional" task results for
Traveller.

Admittedly, this system would need a bit of adjustment to satisfy some
of those people that dislike the current T4 task system (myself
included).  Things like adopting a multiplier of two or three to all
Traveller skills so attributes don\'t dominate the game (TBP has over
twice as many calculated and derived attributes as T4), or simplifying
the two tables I have included above come to mind.

Comments?

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

One other note regarding TBP: it doesn\'t contain rules for space
combat.  Apparently a boxed boardgame does exist (by "Agents of
Gaming"), but it does not use vectored movement.  However, a website
*does* exist that converts the existing movement rules into a
vector-based system-- while still using a hex map.  It can be found

Well If NORAD say so <G>, is that a marble sized using how big of a sensor
antenna array under close to ideal conditions? Maybe one those huge phased
array monsters that they have, by the way was it a active or passive
sensor? <G>

The laser can only hit you accurately it the range calculation/measurement
was accurate enough. 

I remember way back when we were still in "man on the moon" phase of the US
space program, one of the missions left a reflector on the moon. The
purpose so from down here dirtside could bounce a laser beam off the
reflector and back to the earth. End result was the prior calculated
distance to the moon was off more than they had suspected. I am sure that
some of the WAG\'s on this list can provide more details. But it does show
that passive sensor range calcs are less accurate than active sensor range
calcs.

At one light second (300,000,000 meters) with a range calc accuracy of say
0.000001 you would have a range deviation of + or - 300 meters. With that
kind of accuracy the target would not have to evade.

Fighters can be effective against large warships but you can not use
missiles that cost fractions of megacredit and carry a single warhead. The
missile will not be small, it will not be cheap and will carry large
numbers of multiple warheads off nukes and KKM types. If a missile
traveling at 36g\'s, releases 10,000 warheads at say 30,000km from the
target, assuming the missile is armored enough to get past the PD stuff,
the target PD will not get it all, most of it will get to the target. By
the way some of the math inclined it the warheads are traveling at a
velocity of 36g\'s at 30,000km, how long will it take the warhead to reach
the target area? 

The chance to hit could be stated that a weapon with ROF of 10,000 firing
at the target. More than one hit is a certainty

=46ighters, unfortunately, need fuel as well.  They also need a highly
specialized tender/carrier.  Missiles, OTOH, can be fired from any
ship mounting (or capable of mounting) a missile turret.

If it really is a matter of money, though, I was wondering... why
bother with expensive, expendable missiles at all?  After all, it is
much "cheaper" to just use lasers (they don\'t cost MCr2 per shot, and
can\'t be shot down).  Of course, missiles do have there advantages,
but they are still expensive.  A ship that depends primarily on
missiles could conceivably fire the monetary equivalent of an entire
ship each combat round :)

I think it has something to do with antenna size (bigger ships can
mount bigger antennas), although I could be wrong.

Besides, the extra space freed up by not having all of the components
that would aim your laser really wouldn\'t add up to much.  You might
be able to up the powerplant output (via a larger powerplant) and
install more powerful laser...

Of all shows, S:AAB had fighters with turreted weaponry.  It was

So the next time (next time?) I lose my marbles on a trip to the dark

Babylon 5 is a good start however, with space combat scenes that use
Real World(tm) physics (ie: properly vectored movement).  They could
also spread things out so that the combatants are tens of thousands of
kilometres apart, but that would be pretty boring to watch (although
rendering time would be sped up immensely :)

The sensors in Traveller have several issues that need to be pointed
out.


Just because the target is radiating energy of specific level does not
mean that all of that radiating energy level is will be usable by
sensors.


The following is figures derived from technical manuals relating to
energy propagation in space from a isotropic radiator. The formulae used
are:


Surface Area of radiated sphere= 4*pi*r^2

Watts per square meter of radiated sphere\'s surface=P/4*pi*r^2


I used watts rather than field strength levels because I feel that more
people would better understand watts per square meter than volts per
square meter.


formulae are from "Television Engineering Handbook" by K. Blair Benson,
copyright 1986. Chapter 6 Propagation, section 6.2 Propagation In Free
Space, page 6.3


"For the simplest case propagation in space, namely that of uniform
radiation in all directions from a point source, or isotropic radiator,
it is useful to consider the analogy to point of light. The radiant
energy passes with uniform intensity through all portions of an imaginary
spherical surface located at a radius <italic>r </italic>from the
source."


"From the above formulas it can be seen that for free space:(1) the
radiation intensity in watts per square meter is proportional to the
radiated power and inversely proportional to the square of the radius or
distance from the radiator; (2) the electric field strength is
proportional to square root of the radiated power and inversely
proportional to the distance from the radiator."


P=total power radiated

radius=distance


P=1,000,000,000 watts or 1 GigaWatt


milli=10^-3

micro=10^-6

We will also say that for this TL X passive sensor to detect the
radiating signal the signal level must be greater than .5 microwatts.


As you can see the value of watts per square meter will not be larger
enough, so I add in the parabolic reflector antenna signal focusing
properties.


I will be using the 100 meter diameter parabolic reflector(the
information on designing parabolic reflectors I no longer have access to
so I am making hopefully close approximation).


Using the 100 meter PR I get the following values:

Values are in microwatts per square meter

Range in Hexes(30,000km each) 

1      2     3     4     5     10    20    30   40    50     60

1,388  347   154   86    55    38    3     1    0.87  0.56   0.39


So up to a range of 50 hexes(1,500,000km) the passive sensor with PR
antenna can detect the target, beyond that nothing.


Using a lower watt rating for the signal source get very interesting


Using a 1Megawatt radiating source and the same signal detection levels
ie .5 nanowatts per square meter , a 100 meter PR receiving antenna


Values are in microwatts per square meter

Range in Hexes(30,000km each) 

1      2     3     4     5     

1.39   0.35  0.15  0.09  0.06

In this example the sensor can only detect a 1Mw radiating source at one
hex.


Using a 1 Kilowatt or lower radiating source will not be detectable by
the sensor.


Now if we try the same method with a active sensor it gets more
complicated to make it very simple you would need a 1Gigawatt Maser
tightbeam and a 100 meter PR receiving antenna and you would only be able
to detect a target out to 25 hexes (approx.). Illustrating that passive
sensors have twice the detection ability of active with the same
resources(ie power, antenna etc).

This show the amount or error at varous range.

I would say that error1 values could be used for passive sensors and error2
values could be used for active sensors.

Well what do you define at "combat" ranges?
Without the large (greater than 100 meters) antenna you do not have a
decent chance of tracking/detecting incoming missiles.

A 100 meter antenna is not that large in Traveller you can have 800 meter
antennae  .

Well you are assuming what I meant, the best way to mount batteries is so
they can bear on the target. Yes maneuvering can effect which batteries can
brought to bear but it also will effect how well you can track/detect the
target.

Hmmm....the traditional 100 ton scout only has one turret by CT/MT.

Yes but where is sensor array during this roll, or yaw or pitch.

If I have a ship firing two batteries at the rolling scout and the dorsal
side is towards me when I hit the rolling ship only that side is damaged.
Even rolling, the damage will cluster to either the dorsal or ventral
sides, the edges will seldom get hit.

Very much so

Ok then that would mean that Error1 value would be correct for active laser
sensors?

By the way do you have the knowledge/tools to figure out at a range of 10
hexes, at 100 meter sphere, how big would your receiving antenna array have
to be. Also how much power/watts would the laser have to be?

Well I was trying to be generous<G>. I also agree about how distance is
figured in passive sensors. 

In general military use the passive sensors let you know something is there
and the active one give the information/data for a Fire Control Solution.

In current day submarines the passive sonar detects the target but just
before firing the weapon the subs try and active ping to make weapon
placement even better.

0.140Mcr/M^3, but in both Starships and FFS SD is listed as 0.0140MCr/M^3!
In fact, all the material costs are 10 times higher in CSC.  

If CSC is wrong, for example, we\'d shave over 50KCr off the cost of a
speeder like the Rolen Politesse and get the price down to near the one
given in T4. And this would be a multi-million Credit difference in the
cost of starships too!

So, officially, which is the errata?  Is CSC 10 times too expensive, or are
Starships and FFS in error?

Ok looks like you found some more errata I will forward it on to the right
people. How did I miss that one.

I really appreciate the info, James.  I really like B5, and I\'ve been 
wondering about this game.  I didn\'t even know it was out yet.  

It sounds like they\'ve got thier act together much better than IG 
does.  I\'m getting a little peeved at IG.  I\'ve got, what, five books 
now, and there\'s something terribly wrong with most of them.  And, it 
looks like Marc and company are going to keep that half die in the 
revised rules, because I sure haven\'t heard from them about my 
system.

It is not that I\'m upset about them not using my system--I just want 
a good game.  If they come up with something better, then great--but 
get that half die out of there.  

If you are going to fix something, fix it right.

And, I\'m getting tired of them not doing things right the first time. 
 Even Marc has messed up.  Just look at First Survey.

I\'m anxious to see EA and the screen, and I sure hope that I am not 
dissappointed again.

Again, thanks for the info on B5.  It really looks to be a good game 
from what you\'ve posted.  

Can you go into a little more detail about the rest of the game?  
What do you think of it?  If you don\'t want to respond to the list 
(and I think you should), then e-mail me in private.

Thanks,

Kenneth.

Yep, you\'re right.  Actually, it\'s probably even *worse* than you discribe! 


It\'s very unlikely the fighter would be able to change vectors fast enough
to really help it even at a 1/2 ls.  If it could instantly apply 6g in some
lateral direction then it will be in a 6 diameter hit circle of probability
(that works out to something like 1/36 chance to hit), but the fighter
*can\'t* change heading
instantaniously, it\'s going to take time.  Even if it accelerates right
through the heading change (this is where the g load will whack the pilot)
it won\'t have moved 6 diameters away in 1 second! How much the fighter can
evade depends on how fast it can turn, how much g load the pilot can take,
how fast it can accelerate, and how much time it takes the sensor/shot to
make the round trip.

I\'d guess a small *very* maneuverable ship would be able to evade about 1/3
as well as if it could make instantanious vector changes. It\'s just a
guess, and I\'ve got the feeling that it\'s a high guess for a 1 second time
window.

To use your example, the fighter might only be able to evade by 20 meters,
this translates to a 25% chance to hit at 1/2 ls: 

(3.1416*5^2) / (3.1416*10^2) = 0.25  

So, at 150,000k *1* 800ROF laser averages 1 kill/18 seconds and 200
kills/turn.  <g>

You know, this applies to missiles too. They can certainly pull much higher
g loads, but they are still going to have to cross *long* distances against
weapon systems that can track and hit them.  

I\'m thinking the only effective missiles are going to be stand-off weapons
like laser-head missiles that close to, say, .1 ls and pump multiple
X-lasers at the target. They are still going to be in range of their
targets for several seconds before they can fire and they\'re going to be
*very* expensive.

Range isn\'t critical, since any target along the path of the beam will
be hit, regardless of any "range deviation".

10,000 warheads !?!  This isn\'t a missile, it\'s a small destroyer!
I\'d like to see the schematics for designing a MIRV that could carry
and release that many individual warheads over the course of a
fraction of a Combat Turn :)

=46irst off, releasing 10,000 warheads at 36g acceleration 30,000km away
from the target wouldn\'t leave them enough time to scatter, meaning
that one laser shot could hit them all simultaneously.  Besides,
what\'s to prevent me from knocking out this large (how big is this
thing?) missile coming straight at me BEFORE it gets a chance to
deploy its warheads?  ONE minor hit and your out 10,000 warheads just
like that, because now they can\'t even deploy.

I\'m sorry but this is just too silly.

I\'m using it this way as well.  Since a zero leveled 
individual only use (in KBv2.0) the attribute, 
this makes sense.

Here\'s a list of the alterations for KBv2.0:

1)
Multiple Action Rule--Divide target number by number of actions 
desired to arrive at the new target number.  If doing more than one 
type of task, use the lowest target number between the individual 
actions before dividing.

2)
Zero-level skill--Only use the attribute (at its 
full value).  (This is really not a rule change from KBv2.0 since 
3 x 0 = 0)

3)
JOT--Use as Richard has described above.

4)
SS & SF--I\'m still working on this.  I\'ll post it when I\'ve got it 
completed.

No, it means that you know the actual flight time of the photons to
within 1e-6 sec or so, no matter how far it was, so you have a fixed
error of no more than 3e8/1e6 or about 300 meters range.
Once you get stable timing you can measure 0.010033 sec as
accurately as 3.155071 sec, which existing atomic clocks
and optical setups attached to them can do right now...
[You can do better for short range by superimposing a pattern
on the laser freqency and doing interferometry to measure the
shift very precisely, but you need a pattern repeat length of
at least the maximum light time of flight if you do that, and that
gets more or less impossible to work with for times of flight over
a 10km or so distance].

It\'s largely a photon count problem... you need 10 to 1000 photons
to accurately detect them and time them; you can work out the beam
spread over the distance to the target fairly easily: assume a lens/emitter
diameter (say 1m), focal modifier (if you use gravitics... say TL12=5D^2),
frequency/range factor (100), use the stuff in FF&S pp 127, gives you
a range of roughly 25,000km before beam spread ocurrs.  [this is based
on the actual physics involved].  Munge that to 30,000km for simplicitys
sake and you get a range of 10x "short" range, so beam spread is a factor
of 10^2 of the lens diameter, or 100 meters across).  Figure out how much
of the laser energy in the ranging pulse is on-target by dividing the
vehicle cross sectional area (say, simplify to (length/2)^2) by the spot
area (pi * (100/2)^2 ~= 7500 m2).  You cheated and say a 100-meter sphere,
so in this case that value is unity.  For smaller craft this is an important
factor in detectability/ranging though.  You can do a rough photon count using
the formula e=h/wavelength (check a physics book, mine is in a box under
several hundred pounds of rocket design and parts... I believe that the
value of planck\'s constant h is 6.6e-34 in this units system... so a single
photon with wavelength 1e-8 (far UV) has about 6.6e-26 J; a 1-joule pulse
would be 1.5e25 photons).  Since the target surface is uneven and will
reflect in all directions, you have to assume that you\'ll intercept roughly
(collector area) / (hemispherical area at this range) of the photons.
At 10 hexes, that\'s half the area of a sphere 300,000,000 meters radius,
or 4 * pi * (r^2) = 1.13e18 m^2.  A one-square-meter detector mirror
or lens system would intercept 1.5e25/1.1e18 or about 1.4e7 photons
from that theoretical 1-joule pulse with those optics and can easily
determine range (by about a factor of 1e4 more than needed).

This same sequence can be used with arbitrary target sizes, ranges,
laser pulse intensities, etc.  just substituting the appropriate
numbers in where I made a for-example assumption above.

There is an underlying 1/r^4 law in effect here, but it\'s probably
easier to do it this way than work out the results that way.
My astronomer friends aren\'t on the list, or they\'d probably do
it just to spite me, though 8-)

Or rather, it *will*, but from a far wider pool of editors. :)  Seriously,

Fighters: The problem is here we are getting bound up in the reality/traveller reality 
confusion here.  
 
Under CSC, a person can handle by defult a 2g vehical without grav compensators. Ok, now since 
we are locked into 4g by the tech level of the Imperium, we put in our fighter a 4g grav 
compensator. 
 
Now in the real world (tm), fighter pilots have g-suits that compensate g-forces. I dont know 
what, but lets say for arguments sake we can compensate 3g. 
 
Now, what is wrong of combining all three things together? A figher with a person in a g-suit 
(which by this tech level has to be better than today, but lets just use 3g), that is built to 
handle 4g with grav comps, can now go 7g, and in an emergency can safly go to 9g! Given that 
the best ship of the Imperium can only do 4g without use of pressure suits (which as far as I 
know has not been mentioned in cannonal sources)

Think LA in August, if LA were at 15,000 feet. :)  The basic sky color
would be deep violet-blue overhead, fading to more of an aqua shade near
the horizon; add to this a tan-yellowish haze of sulfur compounds in the
first couple of km of the atmosphere, photocatalytically converted by all
that UV-rich sunlight.  Net result from ground level would be white/tan
haze toward the horizon, blue/white haze overhead, with that painfully
bluewhite star glaring down through it.  In other words, *dark* sunglasses
weather. :)

What (if any) are the roles of spacefighters in Traveller?

  Interface duties
As many people have pointed out airpower does not exist in space, but it
does in an atmosphere. If your planning on invading a world it only makes
sense to bring some along with you. This could be met by bringing single
environment atmospheric craft, but they would be dependent on building or
(more likely) seizing suitable surface facilities. I think it would make
more sense to bring dual environment space fighters to provide aircover
during the crutial landing phase.

  Picket/scouts
Fighters are small, manueverable and have good acceleration. Their sensors
will not be as good as those of larger ship, but they are good enough for
the fighters to serve on picket duty and for investigating contacts. However
they would not be expected to fight; see and run like hell. Getting the
information back is too important.

  Close defence
Fighters can stay close to your own big ships to act as an additional layer
point defence. Not as effective as on board PD perhaps, but every little bit
helps.

  Fast Attack Craft
In certain circumstances, fighters will become very potent. The analogy here
is to modern day FAC\'s in confined waters. Put some fighters on a moon of a
gas giant (or even better, inside the GG atmosphere). They are small enough
so that the clutter will hide them and they can sit and wait for the enemy
to come and refuel. They\'d have to hit fast and hard, then run like hell;
but they would be quite a nasty threat.

  Commerce raiding and deep penetration
Your carrier jumps into system and the fighters fan out and hit as much of
the enemy\'s commerical shiping and system facilities as possible.

  Finishing off cripples and engaging escorts
Against damaged ships and escorts, fighters will be effective. Why waste
a big ship to finish off a cripple when it can be engaging a higher value
target? Better to leave them to the fighters, effectively increasing the
effectiveness of you big ships. Then there\'s the enemy escorts, if they are
busy defending themselves against fighters, they can\'t be doing their job of
covering the big stuff. Fighters in this role could be termed a flexible
reserve. On point here in the fighters favour is that they just have to
plot one target, whereas the escort has to plot all the fighters; this will
go someway to counteracting the bigger ships advantages regarding sensors
and fire control. Here it would be an advantage to have an AWAC type vessel
(I\'d term them fighter control ships/craft), either a 100-400Td starship
or a smaller carried non-jump capable craft (think E-2 Hawkeye).

  Engaging enemy fighters
Simply stopping the enemy doing the above. The best counter to a fighter is
a bigger fighter. Here you get to a delicate trade off, the bigger the ship
the less maneuverable (higher inertia and bigger size making turning harder),
plus the bigger the ship the fewer you can have.

  ********************************************************************

On a related topic, many people have proposed that space combat will take
place a very high velocities. While this will be true, I don\'t think that
they\'ll be as high as many people seem to believe. It doesn\'t make good
sense to drop into a system and then accelerate flat out until you met the
enemy. Far better to build up your velocity and establish formation before
jump and arrive in system ready for combat. If you accelerate in a hostile
system without knowing were the enemy is you loss too much flexiblity. If
they\'re comming from the wrong heading its just too hard to react. Plus at
lower tech you have HEPlaR drives and it would be suicidal to burn too much
fuel before combat. Of course this give no additional advantages to fighters
(they are operating under the same rules).

  I hope so, or your accounting system is in trouble.  But, for some
purposes, like say discretionary launch of a spread of small missiles
from a remote location or awkward vector, a small bus with an expert
system is just the answer.  Call it a drone if the pilot is a robot,
or a fighter if it gripes about the food and its\' commanders.  OTOH,
the dividing line between possible roles will be determined by the
design sequences, and in Striker or HG, the minimums aren\'t a problem.

  Economics and/or design constraints.  If my light cruiser wants two
big radar arrays, fine, 2(X) mass, 2 (Y) cost.  If my ten torpedo boats
want one identical capability each for independent use, then 1X and 1Y,
_ten_ _times_.  Hmm.  Is this cost efficient?  BTW, the answer can be yes.

  Sorry, maybe I\'m missing something but with a laser beam your exact
distance is of little concern - the beam will continue if I guessed
short.  Accuracy/precision in the other two dimensions will count.
Even notoriously primitive passive sensors like telescopes can do that.

  36 G\'s is an acceleration, not a velocity.  36 G-seconds would give
you a velocity, but not a real impressive one for our purposes.  What
would be really useful is the physical parameters of a stand-off kinetic
delivery or some sort of Traveller designed missile that works in these
roles.  This means no contact HE, so CT has to use det-lasers :(, but
it should still be attempted.  But "deadfall" ordnance at tens of
thousands of klicks is likely going to end up being very lonely for
the next few thousand years.

  In Striker, at TL 12, each 0.1 kiloton nuke is 15kg and KCr 1.
Ten thousand sub-munitions sounds counter-productive.

  Umm. No. ROF 10K for a laser or battery thereof, yes.  For a spray of
effectively unguided most certainly non-relativistic projectiles, no.
Otherwise I\'ll just bolt Puff the Magic Dragon to my Scout and hose
you down with my 7.62mm rotaries :)

  BTW, the error chart for sensors is what my associates would
specifically call "math".  It\'s not necessarily science.  One
thing that could help tidy up these discussions is some word
on sensor values - real or game canon.  I believe 2300 AD may
have some of those values kicking around - I\'m not sure.

Not as far as I know. Although it is a very popular game in the Academy.

They prefer to use humans on each side, and let the fog of war be

Wrong. Look it up. Bush was in office when the war was over. Clinton
used the US Navy to launch over 100 cruise missiles when Iraq moved some
units in the Krud demilitarized zone back in Sept 96. Read the news.
This happened at lease two separate times. My point is that now the area
over Baghdad is too dangerous for fighters. During the war the Air
Defense had been neutralized and so we could fly with only the guns to
worry about. As long as you stay above 10,000 feet, no problem. Now Iraq
has rebuilt much of what had been destroyed, missiles and radar and
computer systems.

>>>Your definition as to when the "war" officially started and ended is
amusing, especially since you acknowledge attacks that take place both
before and after.  I believe James Gariss\'s reply was accurate, based
on the content of your original post.
<<<

The war officially started on Jan 17, 1991 at 1:30 AM with the launch of
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf. 

Prior to that the special forces had several teams in Iraq doing some
very neat things, clearing the way for the cruise missiles and stealth
bombers that would follow. 

The war ended at 8 AM on Feb 28, 1991, and as far as I know, we did not
attack anything else until Clinton sent in the cruise missiles.

My point stands: The skies over Baghdad are too dangerous for fighters,
UNLESS you do something to knock down the Air Defence. 

But it does bring up some interesting ideas, this is a great model for
how the 3I would be able to bring many hostile planets into the fold. 
 
Use several behind the scenes tricks to make the 3I appear even more
powerful then they are, make an example of one system, use major PR to
skew the opinion, and then watch as more boarder states fall in line
without a fight. 

Ideas?

    'body' => 'Fighters in Traveller would never work like in pop science fiction, 
but used at multi hex ranges like other spacecraft there is still a place
for them in Traveller, for several reasons:

- - Target size. Fighters are much smaller targets than battleships. 
This means that at range a fighter without fire control has the same 
kind of chance of a hitting a battleship as the battleship with fire 
control has of hitting the fighter. Given that fire control costs in 
the region of MCr25 per battery, the fighters have a cost advantage 
in this area.

- - Fire control provides another advantage for the fighters, as a 
large swarm of fighters could easily overload the fire control 
capacity of a battleship, meaning that many fighters would be 
attacked by weapons without fire control, reducing the chances of 
being hit to a very low level. Decoy robotic fighters could further 
overload fire-control and increase survivability for pilots.

- - Battleships designed for combat with like sized ships would be 
denied any efficient target for spinal weapons and big batteries.

The combination of denial of spinal weapons, lack of 
dependence on MFD technology and the reduced size of the dock 
facility needed for fighter construction would seem to make fighters 
a particularly useful weapon for a faction facing a more advanced 
aggressor.

There are advantages in using larger vessels too, but both must 
exist. The reason for this is that designing a battleship to fight 
other battleships is a very different task to designing one 
to fight fighters, the former having larger weapons and less fire 
control. Tactically this means that a battleship targeted at 
fighters is beaten by a battleship-targeted battleship, but the 
battleship-killer is beaten by fighters which are in turn beaten by 
the fighter-killer. This of course gave rise to the Vilani children\'s 
game "Shipkiller-Fighter-Fighterkiller", where players 
simultaneously produce a gesture symbolising one of the ship-types, 
and the winner is determined by the order:
 "Fighters beat Shipkiller beats Fighterkiller beats Fighters."
The gestures are
Shipkiller : Open hand (all fingers point forward at a single target)
Fighter : Two fingers pointed at the opponent (multiple vessels)
Fighterkiller : Fist (no specific direction of attack or defence)

Personally I like this perspective because it makes a space battle richer 
and more colourful than saying \'fighters always win\' or \'fighters 
have no place whatsoever in any circumstance in a battle involving 
battleships\'.

Much of the detail of this is based on FFS and Brilliant Lances, but 
it seems to tie in with the T4 rulebook.
 (As I\'ve only just rejoined the TML sorry if I\'ve misunderstood
 the argument.)

I would think you would have something akin to my PD-0 Planetary
Defender.  This is basicaly the SDB concept but using the same 100Td
hull.  Removing the j-drive and consequental fuel reqs, i was able to
put in more power and a larger weapon system.  I believe it has the 6g
plates plus 2 military quad batteries.

Fusion plus eh?  I\'ve played with them, small plants yes, but the water
can take up space.  I\'ll give it a go on the PD-1 upgraded defender and
see what i get :).

This is true if they use the fuel the whole time.  I agree, with
t-plate fighhters, they become useful for their delta v----but why
not either give t-plates to missiles (expensive) or make a missile
bus that has t-plates.  So a 50 ton missile bay might be a 50 ton
craft (unmanned) that carries a bunch of missiles.

For sensors that can only work at tens to maybe over a hundred kms
the size is\'t much of an issue.  For space craft, the capabnility of
the sensors is determined entirely by size for passives, and by
power for actives.  Fighters have less of both than bigger ships.

Hmm... Range is not critical? Only if the angle of attack is perfectly in
sync with firing laser, example:
 
My missile is approaching the firing ship at a bearing of say 90 degrees,
your PD laser is five meters + elevation and 10 meters aft down the ship\'s
main axis. Your pd laser will firing at angle so range will be factor.

Also the laser is trying to focus the beam to deliver the precise amount of
energy to cause maximum damage. With out accurate range data the focusing
of the laser beam will be off, resulting in less penetration/damage.

Yes I would be happy to see the schematic for a working fusion plant too.
Well remember that a combat turn in space is 10 minutes. There are
multitude a deploying that many warheads during that time frame. By the way
that would be 10,217 warheads of a yield of 50t, mass of 81 tons, and a
cost of 5.1 Mcr. All of this in a 10m^3 warhead module. By the by, the
missile can carry more than on of the these warhead modules.

Well then I release them at an earlier point then, to give them time to
scatter. The missile in question has CSC armor value of >50. That means
that a Point Defense laser will not penetrate its armor. It also has a
agility DM of -25 to be hit. You would have to fire a secondary or main
battery, if they are outfitted to be point defense, to hit it. But remember
it will have lots of friends with it. It your main batteries are engaging
missiles they are not firing at my ships.

>I\'m sorry but this is just too silly.

Too you it appear to be silly, it can be designed using current rules for
vehicle design ie CSC/VDS.

I would describe this as "*designed* to be an artificial limitation", but
at the time I wrote that message no one had decided/stated which version of
Traveller we were discussing. However, I still use High Guard as it is
reasonably fast and playable - I find the TNE design sequences offensive in
*my* universe as it changed canon so much. Dropping T-plates was heresy!
;-) I mean,  I like T2300AD which seemed to be the source of the changes,
but Traveller was never Aliens-esque too me, its always been
Foundation/Norton etc.

T4 has yet (IMO) to have a consistent design sequence, and until then I\'ll
stick with HG and Rob F\'s conversion system.

Agreed. It wasn\'t canon. But when I played Traveller a lot (CT/MT eras) it
seemed to be a common response from refs who wanted to make fighters more
"Star Wars". Much in the same way that most task systems mentioned on the
list start at 2D and go up in whole dice increments...

Personally, I see fighters as no more than an irritation for capital ships.
Your fleet (a combination of escorts, carriers, cruisers and BBs) deploys
in system after jump. The escorts form the initial battle line as the fleet
co-ordinates out of jump, and the carriers deploy fighters to the line of
battle, giving a screen to the capital ships in the reserve. You then close
to battle, which tends to break into fighters and escorts vs fighters and
escorts and the capital ships of both sides duke it out. (Horses for
courses.) The fighters then screen any withdrawl through shear numbers in
the line of battle, then withdraw to the carrier (which is in itself
screened by FE, DD and *maybe* a cruiser or two). The carrier jumps clear,
and the escorts then follow.

As a thought, both B5 *and StarWars* imply that fighters are useless
against capital ships. The Death Star is weak because fighters aren\'t
viewed as a threat and design neglects them (and in Return of the Jedi the
closing of the two fleets is with great reluctance and the fighters get
creamed). In one B5 episode, the \'combined fleet\' hits a shadow fleet (just
before then end of one of the series, can\'t remember which) and the various
ship classes break off to fight their counterparts.

To conclude: Fighters are good for screening the fleet, scouting, hit and
run versus civilian and small military targets, but are not any good
against a capital ship. UNLESS you change the rules. (Which is what the
grouping in batteries mentioned above  was!)

I think he meant that the missile would have a closing velocity of
36 hexes (a 36g burn)----that\'s 600 km/s.  The "warheads" are
dispersed *after that acceleration to the target.

If I read this right, it\'s just a bb missile.

That is correct it I was using Tl-12 but I am using TL-15 for nuke round

Well would your 7.62 have the pen value to even scuff the paint job of a

A shotgun uses the same unguided projectiles to hit fast moving targets. By
the way did I mention that the nukes also had timers so that they would
detonate in the target close proximity. As for the KKM warheads one of them
uses 1cm 10gram spheres with a pen of 38 at the speed of 30g\'s.

It falls off via the inverse square law. And gas giants don\'t really
have "surfaces". What we seen in telescopes *is* the upper atmosphere!

"Big" ships can\'t operate effectively at accelerations higher than

I think he\'s referring to the fact that TP gives the Zhodani a comm
channel that can\'t be intercepted by the Imperial forces. Nor can it
easily be jammed. 

This *would* annoy the hell out of the EW officers! It makes their
efforts pretty much useless.

Sorry, but the "handwaving" mostly affects the heat from the powerplant
and heavy gear. For life support reasons, most of the hulll *still* has
to be at 300-400k, not only due to thermal leakage from inside, but
because of "solar" heating of the hull (at typical mainworld distances.

IRAS detected *lots* of asteroids etc that were noticably *colder* than
this, simply because of the *major* contrast with the 3k background of
the sky!

Doesn\'t apply for a ship sized body unless it is *way* outside combat
ranges. Pretty damn *basic* sensors well be able to pick out a ship at
tens of light seconds. Missiles will be detectable (especially due to
the hot exhaust plume!) at a light second or more.

So? Those stars are *light years* away. We are talking about detecting
ships at a few light seconds or less. *Big* difference.

Please note that the same "mark 1 eyeball" can detect the light
reflected off a sphere less than half a meter across at several hundred
miles. That is, I was able to see Sputnik I from the ground...

Since the *purpose* of the sensors is to not only detect ships, but the
larger chunks of "space junk" at ranges adequate to dodge them, and
while they are inn equilibrium with solar radiation, it won\'t have
trouble picking out ships or missiles.

But that\'s my whole point. That trick worked because the lights made
the plane about the same brightness as the sky behind it. In space, the
sky is far *darker* than you can get any ship or missile to be!

So we are talking about a plane trying to sneak up with its lights on
*at night*.

Sorry, but my take on the "handwaving" is that we need to fix ship
design, not use its shortcomings as an excuse to violate reality in
*other* ways.

You are forgetting that this is a *boarding action*. That means that
the *relative* vector between the ships is *small*. BY DEFINITION!

So as far as the vessel attempting to dock is concerned the two ships
are *at rest* a short distance apart. So the steering jets *are*
useful. So is playing with the throttle on the main drive.

You need to specify *which direction* this acceleration is in. It
sounds like you are talking about pulling g\'s the way fighter pilots
due, not the way astronauts do. 

A fighter pilot feels acceleration mostly on an axis from head to toes.
"Negative gees" are in the opposite direction .

But what the pilot of a space fighter will feel are *transverse* gees.
Thrust will be felt from chest towards back. 

Transverse gees are *much* easier to take. Ordinary people can handle 3
for modest amounts of time (there are *carnival rides* that provide 2-3
transverse gees for 5-10 minutes!). 

Trained pilots should have little trouble with 9 gees transverse. But
given the limits of drives in traveller, 9 gees isn\'t likely.

The only "handwaving" done regarding this has to do with the need of
ships to *safely* dispose of excess heat. The fact that it is emitted

Doesn\'t help much. We *already* have good approaches to it. But there
are *three* kinds of drag. Friction drag, viscous drag and pressure
drag. Pressure drag is due to the stuff piling up in front of you, and
viscous drag is caused by the viscosity of the medium making it hard to
get past you.

After seeing all the discussion about the AWACS Starship, I decided 
to try to design one.  So here it is.  I used the standard SSDS 
template without modifying any of the systems or custom designing 
any-that\'s to come later  :)

So take a look and give me you thoughts/feedback if you would.

thanks

Notes	Including the latest technology and the Capability of jump-3 
give the vanguard class the long range and quick 
reaction necessary for the early warning/ fleet control 
role.	 The ship mounts 4 of the most powerful military sensor suites 
and very stong defensive capabilities	It however does not mount any 
offensive weaponry as the ship is not designed for combat, but 
rather to direct engagements and provide fleet early warning.

Huh?  I can see how they could rotate better, but whay could a guy
in a couch on a fighter pull more (linear) acceleration gs than a
guy in a couch on a BB?

I can see the point if we assume the BB crew is walking around
and not strapped in.  What do you mean?

That does not mean several lightseconds, read my earlier post about
timelags, acceleration, shipsizes and evading. Drop me a note and I\'ll send
it to you as I don\'t want to repost it to the list (it\'s kinda longish).

You cannot have the cake and eat it. Either spinning brings more guns to
bear with no adverse side effects OR spinning makes the damage less severe.
If spinning lessens damage then you assume beam lasers who definately would
be adversely affected by spinning.

I would assume that even t-plates have a nasty exhaust at boarding
ranges (even if it\'s IR photons)----another reason why you *must*
disable the target.  If he is spinning, boarding means send guys
over in EVA equipped vacc suits (or battledress with thrusters).
These guys would be unhappy if caught in exhaust :-)

I\'ve been listening to this argument for a long time, and this is the
argument that I agree with.  It is solid and logical.  

You know what I\'d call these missle boats???  

SDB\'s

Everything that was said about these missle boats, is applicable to SDBs.
Or at least the smaller ones.  

Overall I like the idea of an offensive SDB, sort of a Fleet Missle Boat FMB
or whatever.

(ducks to avoid flying chairs)

You shoot at the passively detected ship and watch (passively) for the
reflected light from hits/missed shots. There\'s your range estimate which
isn\'t all that important in comparison to angular velocity.

Yes they can, but he did say it would carry "large numbers of multiple

wasted if used against capital ships, something that I subscribe to. The
only survivable approach appears to be to use stand off weapons like
missiles. But the ROF of lasers means that they are almost certainly killed
by laser fire.

Now, I have a question. In the T4 combat rules, the fire control rating
limits the number of targets engaged. So I would have thought that the only
way to succeed in hitting is to overwhelm the target with multiple attacks
simultaneously, a la 2300AD\'s Star Cruiser Game. But, defensive fire
against missiles appears to be exempt from the number of targets limitation
(p119). So the question is "Why are missiles not counted against the number
of targets engaged limit in T4?"

If they were, it would give fighters a chance. Do the rules just handwave
this through, or am I reading it wrong? Are there close range PD sensors
not mentioned...

The MT folio adventure "Assignment: Vigilante" considers a mini-carrier
like this, out of a converted liner. I worked up a varient using the T4
QSDS rules and a 2000 Te hull, stealing liberally from high guard for
launch tubes etc. It used the systems off the standard patrol cruiser
(including the same weapons package) with some upgraded sensors and
computers and carried 15(ish) fighters. Can\'t remember the exact details as
it\'s packed away - I\'m about to move house - but I envisioned it operating
with two standard patrol cruisers in an anti-piracy sweep.

The problem comes with minimum sizes of launch tubes - without these the
launch rate severely limits your operational ability to get the fighters
out quickly.

I suppose you may see merchants with grappled fighters not unlike the old
catapult merchant ships in WW2. It would be a sensible response to pirate
raids. Particularly if you travel in convoy...

Yep.  But when fired from a larger ship, these missiles are
immediately identified as the 1000 (to pick a number) targets that
they are.  Anti-missile lasers must begin dealing with that many
targets right away.

OTOH, those 1000 missiles carried by, say, 250 fighters will appear as
only 250 targets *prior* to those fighters launching those missiles,
meaning that a single hit on a fighter can effectively eliminate four
missiles (something the gunners about the target will be trying very
hard to do).

Of course, if you follow this logic back far enough, destroying the
carrier *prior* to it launching its fighters will also destroy the
fighters, which will destroy all the missiles :)

 Not for passives but perhaps for active sensors:
The gravitic pulse need to travel along with the laserpulse/radar pulse to
focus it. Passives go the other way and the only way to do that would be if
the enemy help you by focussing his emissions for you ;)

problem is that as far as I know the trick with sensors is integration
time:
You collect info from your sensor over time and your collected signal
increases proportionally to time while noise increases by sqrt(time) thus
your signal to noise ratio increases by sqrt(time). The problem with this
is that the better your resolution the less time you\'ll have integrating
per lobe area. Astronomers, be it optical or radio, can integrate a long
time but the same can not be said for spece combat guys.

Your calculation shows however what the active sensors (idiots?) need to
know: Even with inverse squared you\'ll get pretty weak signals so with
inverse to the 4:th power just plain forget it! And I\'m not even mentioning
the target solution you\'re giving the other guy buy blaring
microwaves/photons all over him.

My take is this:
Space combat is passive only except PointDefense. The problem is not
resolution of sensors but sensor collecting area and integration times.
This cuts down on combat ranges to make planets big fun obstacles to swoop
around, hide behind et c.

The point is that ship combat turns in Traveller are between 16.7
(High Guard) to 30 () minutes long.  The fact that today\'s human
pilots can handle 9g for short periods of time cannot be applied to
such long turn burns.

OTOH, a g-suit would allow a pilot to handle violent facing changes,
translating into a higher Agility compared to larger ships (maneuver
drive ratings being equal, of course).

Well taking my own statement about uniform "handwaving" yes would could be
possible. But do you have any ideas on stats on a grav focussed sensor, ie
would it be a reduction in antenna size or what.

I hear ya, Kenneth, but the unfortunate truth is that if you are going to

had attribute + skill target numbers and only six-sided dice. Using it in
my campaign, and some mathematically-inclined TML posters, convinced me
this just doesn\'t work. The problem is that the probability of success
between different difficulties is just too much.

Consider the most most common target number, 9 (attribute 7 + 1 from the
character generation, skill 1). I know that experts will have higher target
numbers in their specialties, but most target numbers will be around 9. The
probability of rolling 9 or less on 2 dice is about 84%, on 3 dice about
38%. There would be a huge difference between an "easy" task and a
"average" task and no intermediate tasks unless you go to half-dice.

Is there anyone out there who has played a fleet-level combat situation?
(Like the old Trillion Credit Squadron). And if so, were fighters used? And
if so, how did they perform?

I\'m no physics or military expert - but looking at the game system (both
present and past) it seems that fighters could be quite useful.

Just curious if anyone knows how they performed in Classic Traveller,
MegaTraveller, or TNE...

 Credit the old DGP World Builder\'s Handbook (WBH) for that;
 they\'re the ones that created it. I just decided that the
 standard format for RICE papers would include it.

 While I didn\'t include it in the RICE papers, I also worked up
 an expansion of the starport code along analogous lines.  I\'ll
 be starting to transfer the RICE papers, including that one,
 into Freelance Traveller over the next few weeks...

 ...which is why, when you\'re detailing a world, something like
 this is good.  Until you need it, though, you simply use the
 "high common" tech level as representing the _general_ level of
 technological achievement - If the expanded tech profile is
 generated according to the WBH procedure, it\'s a fair way of
 handling it.

 I seem to recall that in one or more of the previous
 incarnations of Traveller, or the supplemental material, there
 were some sample tables that showed what the various tech
 levels instantiated as - "Germ theory of disease", "Internal
 combustion engines", "Radio - regional range", and so on.  It
 didn\'t go into quite as much detail as the extended tech
 profile from WBH, but it was useful enough for
 "conceptualizing" the WBH extended tech.

So you are saying that we can "handwave" the major producers of heat but
the minor producers like life support we can not. Is a correct? Well I
would prefer a uniform use of "handwaving" for heat management/radiation,
if it can be used on power plants et al then it should "handwaving" the
life support and solar heating.

But the missiles that I have designed use T-plates for drive then no hot

But I am not trying to violate just tying for a uniform system of
handwaving. If you can "handwave" heat management why not in some areas why
no all? Any fix the heat "handwave" using real world physics is no longer

Not toatlly true.  Spinning brings more of _my_ guns to bear, and
also makes the damage done _to_me_ less since the other guys beam
dwells on a given spot for a shorter period.

Offensively, spinning brings more  guns to bear.

Defensively, spinning reduces damage done to the spinning ship.

The MegaTraveller Journal, #2 has an "official" note in the Q&A section
about jump duration.  The question posed there was essentially "if jump
times are so random, how can a fleet commander get all of his ships into a
system at once?"

Joe D. Fugate answered it, and suggested that if you double the jump
preparation time, you change the jump duration from:

124 hrs + (2D x 6 hrs)           (Starship Operator\'s Manual, vol 1)

         to

167 hrs + (2D x 0.1 hr)

yielding a pretty uniform time.  Oddly enough, the SOMv1 suggests that jump
exit "may occur as early as 120 hours" - how they get that from 124+(2Dx6)
I don\'t know. :)

Given Joe\'s formula for double jump prep time, I have to ask why anyone
would NOT spend twice the time (especially at higher TL where it only takes
minutes).  Trade routes would be far more predictable;  you could easily
say "I\'ll be there in 192 hours +/- 1" rather than "oh, a week plus or
minus a day".  You lose the chance of an early arrival, but IMHO
predictability on a regular merchant run is better than sometimes getting
there early.

Book 3 mentions trade routes in its subsector mapping chapter.  There is no
table in my book;  they essentially say "draw them in where they make sense."

Hmmm.. the reason I stated that the target was sphere is because the
circular shape will only reflect back a very small portion of the pulsed
energy lets say only .1 percent. How many photons would that get back to
the receiver?

i use a system sort of based on Cyberpunk.... were you need:

current level X10 points to gain your new level 


eg... 40 points to get to lvl 5 i give them Role Play points
and skill points... skill points can only be used on the skill they
recieved them on.... and Role play points can be saved to raise 
Attributes or to add to exisiting points in a skill to raise that skill1
level
so it\'s a banking system...... i give them around 5 points in a short
game...
up to 10 points.... i try not to give more then have the points as RP\'s and
spread the others over the skills they seemed to use the most or got the

The tech level I used was X, for undefined so that it hopefully show the

It could be stated that each TL has progressively lower detection threshold.

I was not using integration time as factor I was trying to keep in example
in its simplest form. But you are correct about integration times, but I am
not really up to speed on the use of that in Astronomy.

	I think that I\'m about ready to weigh in on the side of the
nay-sayers on the fighter debate.  I think the arguments about long-range
detection, direct-fire energy weapon point defense, peashooter armament,
heavy armour on the capital ships and absence of a speed advantage for the
fighters means that Lucas-esque small fighters would be stunning wastes of
men and materiel.

	I think that what might be worth investigating is more of a gunboat
concept; stuff a big PA gun, a laser or two, and a sandcaster into the
smallest possible hull (say 200Td or so); this gives it a long-range weapon
with punch enough to give a hard target a hard time, and some defensive
capability.  It minimizes the amount you have to spend on hull, systems,
and crew per big gun.  The idea is to spend the most money possible on
*effective* offensive weaponry and M-drive performance, and sacrifice size,
accomodations, and endurance in order to do so.

	This would be the wet-navy equivalent of mounting a 16" naval gun
as a spinal mount on a boat about 75\' long.  Wouldn\'t work in the water
because of waves & such, but you get the idea; cheaper to build a bunch of
small hulls, power plants, etc, so you get more big guns in the water for
the same amount of money.

	You could use smaller yards to build them in, and you could put
more units out faster than if you were building big suckers.  They\'d be
attrition units, designed for wolfpack tactics.  Any of you SFB players
recall PF\'s?

	As far as the statement in the T4 manual that Fusion+ fighters are
what gives the Third Imperium its edge, let\'s recall that this would
probably be against opponents some TL\'s lower.  Fighters might not be
effective against capital ships, but might be quite effective at commerce
interdiction, generally raising hell, infantry support, terrorizing
civilians, and beating up on lower-TL opponents. They might prove very good
at extending sensor baselines too.  And let\'s not forget that this is
Milieu 0; we don\'t even have rules for building ships over 5,000 Td yet.
So the 100,000 Td dreadnaughts won\'t be a problem right away...

	I don\'t quite buy this one, Ethan... if my neighbours are building
ships with inadequate point defenses, all I\'m going to start doing is
building my ships with many, many missile racks apiece, and nuke my
opponents to bits before they get into spinal mount range with massive
missile waves.

	If there are going to be drones or missiles out there, there are
going to be point defenses... and if there are going to be big spinal
mounts out there, they\'re going to have very heavy point defenses, to keep
their gigacredit investment from being fried by a nuke missile that cost a
few megacredits, tops.  Thus, the fighters get fried when they try and play
with the big boys.

	The more I think about it, the more I think that any admiral
sending fighters in against capital ships would be out of his mind.
Fighters against merchants, fighters against interface fighters, fighters
against ground targets, yes, but not against capital ships...  Now a swarm
of the gunboats I proposed a few posts back against capital ships, yes, but
not fighters...

that for most weapons, being dependent of kinetic energy, may have such a

optimally passing on its energy to damage the target.  However, for weapons
such as these (the old high energy weapons), most of the energy used to deal

Using HG (abstracted movement), fighters end up being missile
batteries (IMExperience).  If they have some lasers, they can screen
against other fighters and small ships.

On the other hand, in HG, the space would\'ve been better used by
more missile bays and lasers (not tying up valuable pilots (an issue
in TCS if nothing else).

Not vs. capitol ships, they just do surface damage----useful, but
nothing special compared to missile bays.

In a more movement oriented game, they allow you to spread missile
batteries over a larger volume of space.  This can at least be a
threat to pickets (in addition to being a picket force themselves.

In TNE (BL and BR (_fixed_ BR)) they are aagin useful as missile
platforms.  In BL (and fixed BR) getting a Lock on a missile happens
about 5-15% of the time, so 85% of missiles get through PD (!).
This is without any major bashes to the rules.  Fighters are also
*extremely* difficult to detect if they evade (er, Lock).

As a result, they make a little more sense.  On the other hand,
trying to make a high-g fighter in FFS that is small enough to
remain really hard to spot is difficult (mass gets above dtons*15
very fast on these guys).

	Like I\'ve said before, WHY can\'t "big" ships operate at excess Gs? True, I
can\'t do damage control, or go to the head, but neither can the fighter.
I\'m not going to operate at excess Gs during normal cruising, I\'m going to
pull them at exactly the same time as the fighters will--to save my butt,
kill the bad guys, and break their toys.

	The only advantage the fighter will have is being able to slew faster, due
to that nasty Omega^2 x Radius law.

Above the effective edge of the atmosphere (call it the 1-millibar level),
gravitational acceleration does indeed fall off as the inverse square of
distance from the center of the planet.  Below that, though, it\'s a bit
more complicated, as at each radius you have some of the planet\'s
atmosphere "above" you (at a greater radius from the center), and hence
not contributing to gravitation on you.  In the limit, at the center of
the planet, the acceleration due to gravity is *zero* -- but of course,
you have other difficulties to contend with there... :)

Since far from the GG effective g is (nearly) zero, and at the center it\'s
zero again, it follows that g reaches a maximum somewhere in between.  For
Jupiter, this point is about 200 km below the cloudtops.  It\'s a wide
maximum, though -- effective g remains in the 2+ range for a band of about
1000 km, with the cloud deck in about the middle.

Gravitational *potential*, though, is a separate issue.  This is a measure
of (basically) how hard it is to escape from the planet\'s g-field.  A very
dense earthlike world might have a surface gravity in the 2+ range (not
likely, but it could happen), but escaping from it would be much easier
than doing so from Jupiter, as the total mass (and hence depth of the
g-well) would be far less.

	It\'s a good show, I agree. In fact, Babylon 5 is the only television show
I care enough to watch that I tape it. \'Course, there\'s only about three
shows I watch anyway, but still.

	The problem with the Babylon 5 model is that the weapons on the fighters
are an order or two of magnitude more powerful than the ones in Traveller.
In B5 it is possible for a fighter-sized laser to penetrate the armor on a
big ship. In Traveller, it just isn\'t. A laser that fits into a "classical
fighter" (i.e. a one-man, on the order of 10disp tons), won\'t go through
meters of armor. All it\'ll do is scrape things off the hull IF it hits
something vital and unprotected. In B5, fighters also seem to have more
acceleration than big ships. In Traveller, not.

	The biggest flaw in the B5/Trav comparison is the range of combat. Given
realistic sensors (read: sensors we can build now), a Traveller ship can
detect the fighter quite a ways out; B5 tends to seem to fight at visual
range--it\'s a TV SHOW! They want to show off their special effects. Given
lasers that can fire every other SECOND (ROF800), you\'re dead long before
you get into visual range.

	The range deviation isn\'t necessarily that big of a deal. What I care
about is the angular deviation. Draw a line from where I am to my aiming
point. As long as the target is actually on that line, who cares if he\'s
300m closer or further away.

	And how big is this missile carrying 10,000 battleship-armor-cracking
warheads, and able to accelerate at 36G\'s? And how much fuel does it carry,
so how long can it actually thrust at 36G\'s? And how big is your fighter,
to carry missiles like that? I thought so--it certainly looks NOTHING like
the "classical" 10T one-man fighter. More like a several hundred disp ton
System Defense Boat.

	PS: Releasing at 30,000km leaves the PD plenty of time to nail individual
warheads. Unless you waste this supermissile on a dinky little patrol boat.
But a battlegroup will be able to allocate plenty of fire on the warheads
that are actually aimed at a specific ship. Assuming the captain\'s too
stubborn to maneuver. Accelerating at 36G\'s towards a non-evading target,
you get a closing speed of 1,296 km/s. Releasing at 30,000km range leaves
me 23 minutes to track all the warheads, project which ones are going to be
close to my non-evading ship, decide I\'m an idiot for not evading, or shoot
the dangerous ones.

	Can I have the contract to build these missiles for your Navy?

	36Gs aren\'t a velocity, they\'re an acceleration. The velocity of the
warheads will depend on what the velocity of the missile was when they were
released. And how will your warheads deal with an evading target once
they\'ve been released from the missile? It takes a while to travel 30,000km.

The T4 rules are broken :-)  Actually, a lot of the talk regarding
anti-missile fire was hashed out on the beta list (more even than
here!).  What happened back in the TNE days was that we decioded to
make some "sub-hex" range bands.  These were totally abstracted, but
depending on the type of missile, it would have to get closer and
closer to detonate----that or actually hit the target physically.

The idea was that under 30,000km (one hex in BR/BL) weapons would be
allowed to fire uopn multiple targets witha single _turret_mounted_
weapon----but only if such a target was on an intercept course.  This
was since the target has to try to hit, so it moves in a highly
predictable way.  So missiles that aren\'t det-lasers have a much
reduced chance of reaching the target.

Fighters could operate at ranges above 0 hexes quite well in most
rules as published (or even bashed).  What happened was that in a
recent set of calculations I did for the beta list, it came out that
it was harder to miss than we had thought.  Looks like a non-evading
target would be hit approaching ROF number of times per turn, at
very long ranges.  As you up evasion gs spent (assuming perfect use
of such gs to avoid being hit) it gets slightly harder to hit until
some range where it drops off rapidly.  It might actually map well
to a HG-like set of range bands :-)

The end result of these 0th order calculations is that fighters
within about 1 ls would get hit if they were Locked (both actually
likely at that range in BL/BR, too).

I guess it all depends on whose definition of "the start of the war"
we use.  By Iraq terms, the "war" started long before Jan 17th, with
its invasion of Kuwait in an attempt to create a unified Arabic state
(united against the "evil" western powers :)

Can\'t argue here, although there was never any real need to send in
the F-117A\'s immediately anyways (ie: the UN knew exactly what it was
doing and didn\'t have to resort to any risky maneuvers such as sending
in aircraft into uncleared airspace).

Considering that we are talking about subjugating entire worlds with
populations in the millions or trillions, this would probably be the
best way.

You\'ve lost me.  What difference does it make WHERE on my hull my

I doubt that a laser, capable of delivering damage out to 300,000 km,
would have any noticeable reduction in damage just because the beam is
focused 300m in front of or behind where I believe the target to be.
At those ranges, the damage falloff would be less than 1% (and that\'s
being overly generous).

A working fusion plant is beyond our current engineering technology...
MIRVs are not.  Since you never mentioned what tech level your missile
was based on (and what yield the nuclear warheads were), I simply had
a hard time visualizing a device that could release all 10,000
components efficiently inside of the time frame necessary.  A 36g
missile accelerating over a few turns would have a substantial
velocity... leaving little time to scatter its ordnance (to increase
their likelihood of survival) within 30,000km of the target.

No problem here, except that you specified deployment inside 30,000km.

Hmm.  Several worlds in the Imperium made it to TL 16 in the last 
years of the 3rd Imperium, immediately prior to and during the early 
years of the rebellion.  Some Hiver worlds made it to TL 17.  

Perhaps we could extrapolate that a few such worlds in the RoM made 
it to TL 13?  Not enough to matter, but enough that the odd surviving 
mothballed artifact might be miraculously overlooked by millions of 
people for 2000 years, but was discovered by an enterprising PC? <G>

And I hear you too.  I know, more than most from the tests that I\'ve 
done on both KBv1.1 and KBv2.0 about the half dice being a necessary 
evil.  That\'s one of the reasons I used them in KBv1.1.

KBv2.0 is simply a better system.  It doesn\'t use half dice.  The 
percentages for all difficulty levels and all target numbers are 
good.  And, it give more creedence to using a character\'s skill in a 
particular area and not just his natural ability.

You are right.  If you are going to use only attribute + skill with 
six sided dice, you have to use the half die.

Why not kill two problems at once--the half die and the 
skill-not-meaning-that-much problem--by using KBv2.0?

Or even another system that that might make more sense than the half 
awkward half die system?

Hmm...could be for a future product.  <G>

Seriously, these are the Economic Extensions (EE) to the basic UWP 
for Pocket Empires, which is, I believe, in the process of being 
printed as we speak.  

Resources is a raw measure of the economic potential of a 
world/system as expressed in a single digit.  Primarily useful to 
Pocket Empires.

Labor?  A number that works as an exponent of Population.  A measure 
of the productive portion of a world in interstellar terms.  Again, 
primarily useful to pocket empires.  

Infrastructure?  Refers to the development of a world\'s 
transportations, and communications networks.  Also somewhat useful 
as a gauge of just how evenly technology is distributed across a 
world in physical/wealth terms.

Culture?  Refers to the economic expectations of the world\'s 
citizens?  How much butter they prefer instead of guns.  Again, 
primarily useful to Pocket Empires.  

As for how to generate them, until Pocket Empires comes out, I\'d tell 
ya, but then I\'d have to kill ya.  <G>

Yes.  Greg developed his materials table for CSC after the FF&S numbers were
built into the first version of QSDS and Starships.  Also note that the
toughness numbers are different.  The formula for calculating the armor
value based on thickness is different, too.

I\'ll let you know as soon as I know.  This is a question that\'s currently
being resolved with Marc Miller and IG; in all likelyhood, T4 Deluxe will
use the CSC numbers, resulting in a slight price increase for starships (but
this isn\'t final yet; Dave Golden and I are awaiting a decision from Marc).

For the time being, please continue to use both CSC and QSDS/Starships as
written - they\'re two separate systems, and don\'t generally mix well.  Some
amount of "conversion" is possible (a rule of thumb was provided by Greg in
CSC, and more detailed rules appear in _Emperor\'s Arsenal_; I\'ve also posted
on the subject to the TML in the past).

I know that Imperium Games and Marc Miller are aware of the problems created
by having two systems trying to co-exist in one game, and are working toward
resolving the problem.

By the bay did you get look at Emperor\'s Arsenal? The nuke section could be

yes more properly stated angular deviation would have effect. Well lets try
an example of the my point:

Your ship is firing at a missile/fighter that is not attacking your ship at
all. The longitudinal axis of your ship we will call the Z axis. The other
two will called X and Y. Y being the going from keel to superstructure, and
X going from port to starboard. Your course of your ship is 0 degrees, you
are not evading or rolling. The target(read missile)is approaching your
ship at 90 degree angle on the x axis. But the targets line of travel is
below the X plane of your ship, it would pass underneath your ship by 1km.
The target/missile is evading and doing three times your speed. Lets say
that the Y axis angle is 135 degrees at the point you are going to fire.
Your firing battery(1 turret) is located along the starboard side at the 90
degree point on the X and Y axis. Your Firecontrol system will be firing a
100 meter diameter pattern in order to have the best chance of hitting the
target.(yes I know it an arbitrary pattern) But the range error in this
case off by 300 meters, ie your FCS has placed the target 300 meter ahead
of it self. Your FCS will be basing its TOT(Time On Target) upon this. The
end result being that when the laser pulses get there, they will be 250
meters ahead of the target/missile, net result no chance of a hit.

Now if my target/missile was attacking your ship at 90 degrees on the X and
Y axis yes the range error will matter little. But who says that missiles
can not perform the maneuvers of current day antiship missiles, like a
popup tactic or a TankBreaker? maneuver popping up and detonating above the
target.

It is the minimum canon size that Thruster plates can be mounted on. ie 10
dt. No fuel needed as current design status, using storage cells, duration
at this point 2 hours at full acceleration of 36g\'s, longer if it goes
slower. Yes the missile carrier will not be a 10 t fighter, but refer the
missile as torpedo and the torpedo carrier as a "Torpedo Boat" "ducking
thrown objects"<G>

The design status is waiting the calculation of the pen of the nukes using
the nuke types from Emperor\'s Arsenal.

Ok but in another post you said the closing time would be 60 minutes 23 secs?
But what if deploy warheadsat 3,000km or even 300km. With a armor value of
CSC >50 it will shrug off any hits if you get any remember the agility DM
is -25 to be hit. 

OOps correction the torpedo "Bubba" is 30g\'s. This not the one that will do
that but it looks like "Little Bubba" will.

This makes me wonder whether the Zhodani -- or others who use psionics, like the

There are two good examples bri. One is the MT module Arrival Vengeance. In
it, there is a picture of a Vegan talking to two Dolphins. It\'s not a full
body shot, though. In Traveller Chronicle #10 (That right Harold?) there is
a picture of two Vegans and one of their beasts of burden. It could be 11.
I don\'t remember. Hope that helps.

I\'ve seen, what the others have guessed, so I\'ll leave my guess here,
too.

I\'m no astronomer, but I would tend to a darker sky (because of the thin
atmosphere) and the light-spectrum tending more to a yellowish-orange
taint.

So practically, the 10 minutes/6g combo is the "faster" ship, correct?

If i have one car which can do 0-100km in 6 seconds, and another that can
do 0-100km in 10 seconds, but both have  atop speed of 250km/hour then car
A is tha faster car.  The reason it is faster is because of the way the
engine is built (and of course other factors, but the engine is primary),
which is what i was getting at, vaguely admitedly (well, not to me:), but
the same thing.

This seems to be the case in the traveller universe, but im begining to
wonder how "realistic" this is.  It coudnt be that difficult to build a
nice ship killing (small) weapon - could it?  Also, missiles seem to be
weaker then the real world.

See my other post concerning this.  I was speaking within the context of
the argument, fighters vs battleriders.  The loss of the battlerider with
all its crew is worth more than the loss of a few pilots.=20

True.  So we come to the crux of it all, apart from low intensity battles
(or soft targets) even modern aircraft are defunc?  I find it hard to
believe, its all the more worse since the last serious naval conflict was
over 50 years ago.

WHich is the point, we would be talking about a major war only, where the

Which is a shame, it couldnt be that hard to introduce a weapon of
substantial power.  Sensors are a moot point, fighters dont need adavanced
sensors, just good targeting combined with smart weapons.  Horizons i
think may be offset by some keen weapons and high manvr., which traveller
also seems to lack.

Fair enougth, i just still wonder about the "reality" part, since they
seem to be fairly useless in traveller.=20

Anyone want to do a simulation?  Have a capital ships vs equal tonnage or
cost of 10t to 50t fighters? (no carrier).

Im curious to see if they actually would do any damage at all.

They dont need the sensors of a big ship.  It would be wastage.  They
would be ordered (im assume) to go to cordinates x,y,z and engage detected
hostiles.  They would just need targeting, and even this may be redundent

True.  Im also making an assumption here that in taking a world you dont
want to obliterate it.  So a battleship (unstreamlined cause its cheaper)
wouldnt have the finese for targeting as a fighter would.  Also
battleships couldnt give much support to troops on the ground (close
quarter support) as opposed to "we want this sector nuked" which the
battleship would be handy for :)

Okay, lets assume that the weapon is a smart device, has inbuilt
targeting. Maybe its so smart that it homes in on transponder signals.  No need for
excessively complicated targeting on the fighter itself, just on the
weapon.  What do you think of that?

Yes of course, but the orginal poster used 1 battlerider vs an equal
tonnage of fighters, which i think is wrong (and i stated so) but i
remained within the confines of the argument.

Of course it is a waste, let me qualify.  Im speaking within the confines
of the argument.  Losing a hundred pilots (excessive, but usefull for
illustration) is pitful compared to the destruction (and loss of life
thereof) a battlerider.

Also, pilot scarceness is culturally linked as well as resource linked.
Germany in wwII had no real problem in finding pilots, nor did japan (they
sacrificed hundreds by the end of the war).  The soviet union and the USA
also didnt have extensive problems with pilot acquisition, while England
did.  

Im assuming that the opposing powers are of equal resource strength (large
empires perhaps?) and wouldnt have a great problem with training new
pilots - which still doesnt justfy wasting them though.

True.  So perhaps we should remould the argument.  Im willing to concede
that carrier based massed fighters maybe redundent, but what about planet
based or mixed arm battleships (battleship carries a small squadron of
planes)?

True, but its more convenient to place sensors and the bridge in usually
susceptable places.  Also, the spinal mount can be susceptable to attack
as well as the engines.  The destruction of anyone of these things will
badly affect the battleships combat ability.

So, the assumption (which may well be right - i havnt played traveller in
years, and never played the current version) is that Battleships, in the
main, no matter what size, will have 6g acceleration?

So, no fleet in the known universe can outrun an equal tech fleet?  You
can never have a manevreability advantage over another vessel?  It doesnt
cost excessively much to equip a cruiser or higher vessel with 6g manvr.
engines?

Now, im sorry, but if thats how traveller is now, i think thats wrong.
Also, if thats the case, why would you build anyship at all without 6g
acceleration?  Why would there be a slow boat and a pinnance? why doesnt
every ships in the starship manual have 6g acceleration?  Its not
consistent with the arguments presented here.

What do other people think?

Which is the exact point i was making when i mentioned the carrier vs
surface ship.  Of course a HS vs CV would win, but thats an unrealistic
comparison in the sense that you have deprived the CV of its "air" power.

Probably an american :)

Its the core of warfare, Napleon knew it, Mainstein knew it, now you know
it.  Apply as much force as you can to the enemies weakest point.

Which, again i will concede.  I was seperating a HS weapons as they are
today, and have been for many years - Big Guns used for shore bombardment
and capital vs capital combat and PD weapons used for anti air warfare.

Also, if i remember corecctly the High Guard rules had a limit on the
number of turrets that a vessel could have, is this still true?  If so,
then fighters could outgun Battleships in equal tonnange/cost (?)

I\'ll post to the list (for those that might be interested), but I\'ll
try to keep it short.

Physically, TBP is available as a 196 page softback printed _entirely_
in colour on standard glossy-stock paper.  Since the paper is slightly
thinner than that used in the T4 hardback, the book feels somewhat
more delicate (this feeling comes from fondling the durable Shadowrun,
Wraith, and T4 hardbacks too much :)  I am somewhat surprised that--
based on the huge following of the television series-- CEE didn\'t
consider selling a hardback version.  It has a price tag of $25 USD,
which is also a bit steep if you ignore the full colour layout.

Cosmetically, the cover art is the only real good art in the book--
despite what CEE (Chameleon Eclectic Entertainment Inc.) claims-- and
is provided by the visual FX studio responsible for the CGI in the TV
series.  There are a few other pieces of digital art through out the
book, but they all suffer from a lack of anti-aliasing (ie: they look
pixelated or "blocky").  The four-colour hand drawn art ranges from
"blah-zay" to "pretty good" (with plenty of lens flares provided by
Adobe Photoshop), which is about two orders of magnitude lower than
CEE\'s own review of their art :(

The rules are nicely laid out, using colour whenever possible to help
out.  There is a fair amount of background material, no doubt to be
further backed up with additional sourcebooks.  Unfortunately, only a
very basic "Table Of Contents" is provided, and there is no index.
However, the "Table Of Contents" also contains the only typo that I
have found, so far...

Character development is laid out in such a way to encourage players
to flesh out their characters and not just participate using a number
of statistics.  A total of twelve Attributes exist, divided evenly
into Physical (Strength, Agility, Endurance, Coordination), Mental
(Intelligence, Insight, Wits, Perception), and Cultural (Charm,
=46inesse, Presence, Xenorelation).  Three derived Attributes are also
included (Toughness, Initiative, Resolve), and Psionics is treated as
an optional Mental Attribute.

Players begin by choosing a race (no, you can\'t play a Vorlon) and
writing down the average value for each Attribute.  Players are then
free to alter these stats by as much as +/-2, but the original
Attribute _total_ must remain the same (ie: for every +2 you wish to
apply, you must also apply a -2 or two -1\'s somewhere else).

You then answer a bunch of questions designed to build up the
character\'s background, so that skills can be assigned (there are no
"classes" like "Mercenary" or "Paladin").  Skills are then chosen,
following certain guidelines laid down by the referee and the campaign
s/he wants to run.

=46inally, descriptions called "Characteristics" are included as
roleplaying aids to help describe the character outside of his or her
Attributes and Skills (eg: Curious, Selfish, Ambidextrous, Enemies,
etc.).  All Characteristics have both Pros and Cons, but should be
cleared by the referee just in case.

Skipping over the Task System (see earlier posting), we come to an
interesting combat system sharing certain traits with an old RPG
called "Aftermath".  A hex-grid is superimposed over a silhouette of a
humanoid, with a default aiming location just below the heart.  A
normal skill task result is used to determine the degree of success or
failure (again, see earlier posting), while a third six-sided die is
rolled to determine the direction of scatter from that aiming point.
If a target is standing behind cover, simply obscure part of the
silhouette with a piece of paper.  Combat takes place during 2-second
turns, during which players act in order of their Initiative.  A house
rule popped up almost immediately that subjected the determination of
initiative to a task roll of its own (breaking the rigidness of the
current system and allowing slower characters the possibility of
acting sooner than normal).

Basically, the hex-grid allows attacks to deviate in six different
directions, with the amount of deviation depending on the level of
success (two hexes -2 Damage, one hex, target hex, and target hex +2
Damage, respectively).  The hex-grid is laid out in such a way that a
Marginal Success (two hexes deviation, -2 Damage) can easily shift an
attack off target enough to miss entirely.

The silhouette is also divided into 15 different hit locations, to
help indicate which areas are protected by body armour, if any.  Basic
humanoids are covered by the silhouette provided in the rulebook, but
I can easily see CEE providing additional target silhouettes in future
releases (possibly even including different positions like crouching
or lying prone).

=46or ranged combat, a player may alter the position of the default
aiming location by expending one action aiming (actions spent aiming
can also be exchanged for a beneficial -2 modifier, to a maximum
benefit of -4).  The layout of the hex-grid on the silhouette also
provides the drawbacks of aiming at isolated hit locations such as
hands or feet, since a shot that deviates has a very good chance at
missing altogether (remember, unless the hit is a Significant or
Critical success, the hit _will_ deviate at least one hex).  Dodging
targets also act to provide a penalty to the attacker\'s target number.

=46or HTH and melee combat, the further away from the default aiming
location you wish to aim, the greater the penalty (TBP states -1 per
hex, although some players have discussed changing this since it seems
a bit too harsh).  In certain circumstances, the referee may alter the
location of the default aiming location.  Unlike HTH or melee combat,
however, the attacker cannot spend one action aiming to do the same.

The target number for a HTH or melee attack is the opponent\'s Agility
if the attack is not actively defended against.  To actively defend,
the character must have a lower Initiative rating than the attacker
and expend his or her action for that round-- a defense roll resulting
in a Significant success allows the target to automatically usurp
initiative over the attacker the next round (ie: that character gets
to act _before_ the attacker during the next round, regardless of
their Initiative ratings).

HTH and melee attacks have their own "martial" skills as well.  The
human art Akido, for example, gives bonuses (ie: "Specialties", if
you\'ve read my previous posting) to Parry/Attack, Pull Off Balance,
Multiple Defense, and Blind Fighting.

The medical and healing rules are quite good, but do not bog down game
play during combat.  During combat, non-leathal wounds inflict certain
penalties to all physical actions performed by the injured character.
Characters must also roll to remain conscious, depending on the wound
level.

Immediately after the combat, rolls are made to determine blood loss
(ie: how soon the player can go without basic first aid).  Rules are
also included limiting certain hit locations to the amount of damage
they can suffer (this also affect the rate that different body
locations heal at), whether or not an attack is severe enough to cause
broken bones (which mainly affect healing time), and how long a
seriously untreated wound will result in death (this one\'s obvious).
The temporary task penalty applied during combat due to the wound is
replaced with a more severe modifier that affects tasks involving that
particular body part (yes, there is a "Groin" hit location).  All of
these rules are handled using one, simple-to-read chart.

Lastly, characters possess what are known as "Fortune Points", which
are given out by the referee as rewards during the game.  Two of these
=46ortune Points can be used to add an additional d6 result to a task
result after the task roll has been made.  If the result on the extra
die is unsatisfactory, the player can spend another two Fortune Points
and roll again, keeping the better of the two results.  If the result
still isn\'t satisfactory, two more points will grant another roll (and
so on).  Fortune Points can also be used to save a character from
certain death, or perform tasks that the character couldn\'t normally
do.  These last two methods are subject to referee approval.

That\'s what the factor of (detector area) / (hemispherical area at that range)
is for... it assumes that of the photons that get to the target, they are
reflected evenly over half the spherical space on your side of the target.
So, the photons that reflect right back at you are (area of detector)
divided by (half total spherical surface area of sphere with radius as
large as the range to the target)*.  We earlier determined there were
order of 1.5e25 total photons in the 1J ranging pulse; with range of
300,000km (3e8 meters, 1 light-second) you get a total corrected
(see below for my error in the first analysis...) returned photon count of:
	1.5e25 / [ (1/2) * (4 * pi * ((3e8)^2) ]
...which works out to 2.6e7 total photons.

* Looking at my own numbers, I managed to drop the factor of
1/2 in the example given; the 4 * pi * (r^2) should be 2 *  pi * (r^2)
to account for only reflecting over half the total spherical volume not
the full volume, so double the number of photons that arrive back in the
example.

** Looking further at my own numbers, the 1/R^2 factor for the spot area
early in the analysis is incorrect: the intensity will be 1/R^2, but the
spot radius goes as R/sr when actual range > computed short range.
At "short range" the spot is the same size as the effective diameter
of the laser aperture.  Beyond that, it spreads out at a fixed angle
as described by R/sr ...  however, this doesn\'t affect the conclusion
of the example here, because the spot shrinks below the specified target
size (from exactly the specified target size) and the returned photon 
count stays the same.  That is just good luck, however, make sure and
do it right in any real calculations for followups...

If Emperors Arsenal is M0 then hopefully there\'ll be other weapons so that
M0 develops a feel of its own. That was one good thing with the Foss art:
Everything in the M0 era looks blobby, rysty and scientifically
implausible. Thos saying that this is unrealistic look at american cars in
the 1950 AD era.

There\'s a picture of a Vegan in CT Supplement Library Data (the one with

 It seems unlikely to me that even tradintionalist Vilani wouldn\'t have
learnt something from the loss of the First Imperium at the hands of the
Terrans. I think that Terran ships would\'ve used missiles a lot, as the use
of Anglic suggests they were West dominated, and would thus have favoured
man-power saving standoff weapons. This encourages the installation of good
anti-missile point defences, which would work damn well on fighters, as well.
 I fail to see why a mono-gun ship wouldn\'t also have the crew in G-tanks,
or just acceleration chair, and run at a G or two over the compensators for
the initial engagement (or when fleeing). Besides, I for one wouldn\'t want
to be in a fighter, in deep interplanetary space after some enemy (realising
he can\'t get away) just vapourised my carrier, and I don\'t think you could
kill a BB fast enough with fighters to stop this, esp. if the spinal mount
had any sort of range.
 As to the countermeasure problem (which I see I snipped out), you don\'t
have to copy the fighter tech to counter, just add anti-fighter escorts to
your fleet (destroyers armed solely with PD weapons), and refit your current
fleet with a better PD suite.
 The advantage TL12 gives, IMO is having nuclear dampers and meson screens,
as these give you staying power.

OK the basic argument is about active sensors superiority due to them being
able to calculate the range more exactly and faster than passives. The post
you\'re (Sam Thomas) replying to said that we\'re not that interested in
range when shooting with beam weapons (true). You then concoct a really
stupid scenario the passives would use in order to "prove" the superiority
of actives.
You basically assume that passive sensors will not shoot at the predicted
future angular location but the actives will. Please enlight me if I have
misunderstood your reasoning.
BTW In your example the TOT will be neglible so in that particular case it
is actually OK to shoot at the last angular position with
lasers/mesons/neutrons.

    'index' => 'bj808',
    'body' => 'To help keep the fighter discussion going, here are some quick numbers I
  worked out for a confrontation between a BattleShip/BattleRider and a
  small army:

  Attacker: 200,000 T Battleship.  Cost in excess of 146,000 MCr.
    Assuming:  Computer Model 9. Def DM=7.
    800 Missle batteries, 90 laser batteries, 1 Particle accelerator,
    5 meson cannons, some sand casters.
    Armor:  110

  Defenders: 1,259 strike fighters from Fighting Ships of the Imperium.
    2 pulse laser batteries, 1 missle battery, Computer model 9, DefDM=17.
    Armor:  Doesn\'t matter.
    Note that the size of the fighter squadron was chosen to come out close
    to the price of the battle ship, and that equal tonnage would have
    given a fleet of 20,000 fighters.

  I started out using a strike battleship for the attacker, but realized
  that it would be too easy, so I handwaved the exchange of the jump drive
  for a few hundred missle batteries.

  First, an observation that pg. 95 of the MT ref\'s book says that fighter
  squadrons may be organized into batteries if the ships all have the
  same agility.

  Second, and here\'s the weak part, is that a ship scoring a critical success
  on its to hit roll (and within visual range) may do a pin point attack.
  If the attack was really exceptional (an additional +2 over regular
  exceptional), then the location is hit by a critical hit.  What gets iffy
  is that the battleship gets a -23 DM on its damage table when
  the fighters attack it, so I assumed that the rule that critical hits
  always remove a point of armor (pg. 94) applies.

  Okay, so here are the battle preparations:
    The fighter fleet organizes into a group of about 41 squadrons just to
    make sure that their effective fire is as strong as possible.  The fighters
    advance to visual range (neighboring hex to the battleship) and begin
    firing).
  And here\'s what my quick calculations of the results would be:
    1.  Each round, the battleship will kill whatever it hits (several
        criticals on each fighter hit).
        To save time, assume that the mesons and PA hit each round.
        And assuming about 900 shots from all the other batteries,
        the target number is a 12 to hit (11-9 (comp)+17 (def DM)-7 (weapon))
        for 25 hits in addition.  Since the fighters have no defenses,
        assume that each of those hits kills its target.

        So the battleship is killing 30 fighters per turn, and in
        42 turns the enemy fighters will all be dead.

    2.  Assuming the fighters stay in the 41 squadrons to minimize unfairness,
        each shot ends up having a 2+ target to hit, and a 6+ chance of
        a critical hit at visual range.  The odds of penetrating are about
        6+ again, so the battleship can expect 10 critical per round.
        To even things out, I\'m assuming that the missle batteries don\'t
        hit, or just serve to keep the sandcasters busy.

        So, it will take about 4 or 5 rounds until the battleship starts to
        take surface damage (the maximum modified damage rolls start to 
        exceed 0), and about two more turns before the battleship\'s armor
        drops to 40 or less, and each hit starts causing damage.

  Observations:
    1.  Okay, I conceede the point that none of these fighters (except maybe
        the 30 which die each turn :( ) will be stupid enough to get within
        50,000km of the battleship.

    2.  Depending on the ships being used, the battleship has atleast
        800 crew members.  The attacking swarm of fighters has around
        2500 crew if the Fighting Ships fighter is used.

    3.  The carriers in Fighting Ships carry between 300 and 600
        20-30 ton ships.  The fighters used here are 20 ton fighters.

    4.  No, I didn\'t bother to see if the ship designs were valid.  I was
        just doing some quick possibility studies (as opposed to feasibility
        for launching 1250 fighters from a planet/base).

    5.  Okay, I\'ll admit that I was really stretching the rules into places
        they probably weren\'t designed to go when doing these calculations.
        One of the things I did do was to ignore the bit about getting a
        pinpoint critical hit and rerolling until you get the location you
        aimed for, since it isn\'t possible initially to get past 0 on the
        chart for the first few turns.

  End result:  After suffering probably massive losses (50% or so), the
  fighter fleet should win.  Note that unless the battleship has jump
  capacity, there is no way for it to get away (which is what an agility
  of 6 is good for--the fighters decide when the battle ends...).

In summary, as the MT rules are written, you don\'t need special rules for
  fighters to be effective.  You just need a really big army of pilots
  (about 3 times the crew of the handwaved battleship above).  All you
  really need is a really large number of them.

And yes, I will admit that the fighters really would be better off performing
  more realistic roles (not to mention less challenging to the rule lawyers)
  like finishing off damaged capital ships, really intimidating the players, 
  and performing scouting/patrol missions.  I also know that one of the
  reasons this tactic works is that the battleships are designed to easily
  damage other ships of similar levels of armor and weaponry, and not
  to kill huge armies of fighters.

And just think, the odds of dieing on the side of the fighters starts at
  1/40 and rises, so there probably isn\'t more than a 5 percent chance
  of being a casualty each round.  Oh, and most of the damage to the
  battleship will be on the surface chart, things like fuel, weapons, drives,
  and hull.  It might even be worth salvaging after the combat is over.

But the real question is wether or not T4 is going to allow this sort of
  encounter to work quite as well (if at all).  If it does, then there
  probably isn\'t a need to have ships with mini-spinal weapons.

Actually, I believe that the Starfury\'s weaponry is based on the same
Phased Plasma Gun (PPG) technology that is visible in pistol & rifle
form on the TV show.  I say this because they make no mention of laser
weaponry in the RPG.

=46ans want to see dogfights... they want to see "cause and effect"
(preferably both on the screen at the same time).  If the fighters
were armed with plasma guns, the range problem would make more sense.
But who uses plasma guns when lasers are more accurate and longer
ranging?  Of course, the larger ships use what appears to be beam
weaponry of some kind, and those mysterious "Old Ones"... who knows???
(I always thought that ancient races would be more benevolent--
OBVIOUSLY not :)

Nah.  That limit is, as you pointed out, intended to model the effect of 
"blow through" for projectile/kinetic energy weapons.  It doesn\'t hold 
true in cases of, say, the damage received when a cannonball hits a 
player - it\'s hitting a large area of the body.  Or when shotgun 
fire hits him - lots of projectiles hitting at once.  Or, in this case, 
when a stream of plasma hits him.

*BZZZZT* Sorry, wrong answer! Probably everyone on this list has been
on a space battleship, including yourself. We are discussing game
tactics with game weapons in a game setting; this is something
that seems to always get lost in these arguments. So it is perfectly valid 
to modify real world examples
with what we know works in the game world.

But would this have happened in your example if the Prince of Wales had 
been armed with LOS weapons that fire and hit at c, and the Prince of
Wales had been capable of accelerating and moving just as fast as the
fighters? See? The aircraft carrier analogy does not work, at least until
we have battleshiips and cruisers that can accelerate at multiple Gs and 
hit speeds of 600 knots.

Once again, this only works in a planetary situation where you have a horizon
the carriers can hide behind, weather that can hinder visual sighting, fighters
that can travel magnitudes faster than capital ships, etc. Once you move 
this situation out into the big, wide empty expanses up there with LOS 
weapons that can are effective at extreme ranges and large cruisers and 
destroyers that can race back to your carrier as fast as your fighters can,
it doesn\'t seem like that nice a situation.

Because all the other ships can travel just as fast as your fighters? Why do you
keep ignoring everytime this is pointed out? Aircraft travel far faster than
ships,
spaceships travel just as fast as space fighters.

 You\'ll have to handwave somewhere. I can agree to cooling off the p\'plant
with superheated hydrogen plasma bled off the ship (the cool blue light
from the enginelike coolers at the back off the ship). But if you are gonna
postulate that ship hulls are 0 Kelvin or close I might as well play D&D.
Whenever handwaving is neccessary keep it to a minimum please.

Not to mention KEAP rounds from tanks etc ;)
My suggestion is trashing the rules (all of them) and make your own based
on sound physical principles and math. Start with some definitions like
what actually do I want +1 to hit mean (in my case +1 means the doubling of
the hit propability controlling value like doubling the area at a given
range or increasing the range by a factor sqrt(2)) then define game values
out of this. I wanted to hit DM on a normal human to be 0 which gave me:
0.5 m2 equals 0 DM. Continue doing a few more definitions (what value do I
want a normal STR 7 fist be?, a 9mm round? Then follow physical laws and
everything fits ;)

I could describe the system to those interested but most people on the list
seem to be stuck into the "we have to be compatible with the excellent
products from Imperium Games". Anybody doing their own
design/combat/spacecombat systems that are interested can drop me a line
and enough interest is shown I might write down the basic principles,
formulas et c that I use. Be prepared to toss hitpoints, tasksystem et c.

that system works better for merchant ships than warships - there were a
number of things I wanted to do but could not due to the system
limitations.  Ah well, that\'s what you get for going the simple route, and
since I forgot to pack Starships I don\'t even get to try out SSDS while
I\'m here in Denmark the next six months.

  Anyway, here is my preliminary design.  The major problem with it is due
to QSDS - the armor rating.  I\'d like something larger, but there are only
three ships with more than 20 points of armor in the QSDS list.  The 200T
needle is too small for this job (at least I think so), the 400T Wedge is
not streamlined, so wilderness refueling is out, and the 800T sphere is
too large according to the design requirements.

  The other problem is that there is no provision for L-Hyd tanks in QSDS.
The design I\'d like to make would have a 400T hull with a 100T tank.  In
normal operation the tank stays on for J2 operation.  Dropping the tank
gives one J3 jump, with subsequent performance at J1 until the tank gets
re-attached.  This is similar to the old Close Escort from Classic
Traveller, and allows a more flexible operating envelope.

  Anyway, here is the design - comments welcome.


Generica Shipyards Model 45212 - Patrol Cruiser (QSDS)

Crew Detail:	4 Engineers, 2 Electronics, 2 Manuever, 9 Gunners
		1 Screens, 2 Aux Craft, 3 Command, 1 Steward
		1 Medical

  The Type 45212 combines a mix of weaponry in an inexpensive package
capable of both fleet and independant operations.  Defense is a
combination of laser, sandcaster, and meson screens, as well as the
potential to carry small patrol craft to support the mission.  Offense
consists of both missiles (controled by a central fire director) and
long-range lasers that allow the Type 45212 to stand off and engage the
enemy.  Combined with manuever 4 capability, this ship can deal handily
with the typical small pirate or commerce raider opponent.  In both
defense and offense, the Type 45212 can take advantage of its
military-grade sensor package, allowing it to act as controller for
missile-pack SDBs in a system desense role.

  Equiped with both a sick bay and fuel purification systems, the Type
45212 is capable of extended independant operations.  All crew members are
housed in roomy small staterooms rather than bunks to provide
additional comfort on long patrols.  The three command crew (Captain,
Gunnery Officer, and Chief Engineer) have large staterooms of their own.
To accomadate additional command personell, two large sterooms are
provided.  By doubling up on crew space, additional persons can be
accomadated.

  Hanger space for two 5T fighters is provided, along with space for their
pilots.  Since current fighter doctrine is under review, no craft are
included in the bid.  If small fighters are not required under the final
operations orders, this space can be allocated to additional storage,
yeilding 20 tons extra space.

  Generica Shipyards used only Sylea Industry Norm (SIN) components in
this design.  As a result, total cost reflects a substantial discount.
Volume production can commence immediatly, with large deliveries as
needed.


Design Notes:

  This design was a compromise, middle-of-the-road sort of thing, with a
mix of weaponry.  I originally wanted to put in a 100T TL-12 PA-Gun, but
it did not fit, darn it, at least not without compromising the other
systems, since the gun sucks so much power.  With a 600T hull it might
just work, but the QSDS 600T hull is only M2 and 10 points of armor.  I
went for some long-range lasers instead, to give the ship some punch to
deal with small opponents.  As mentioned above, the big problem is armor -
I\'d like more but am not willing to learn SSDS for that reason alone. 

  I considered some smaller designs, but they seem less effective to me,
since there are fixed sizes for many of the components (sensors, fuel
purification, meson screen) and that robs space in a smaller hull.

  If you decide small craft are not needed, there is room for a few more
things - I sized the power to leave about an extra 50 MW, so one could add
more missiles or sandcasters. 

  An interesting exercise - I\'d love comments.

You are absolutely right about the TL 16 worlds in the Third Imperium, but,
as you also pointed out, they were not all that common.

I didn\'t know that about the Hivers, though, but find it a _very_

What you found was an early copy of the task system, I believe.  The 
correct progression is:  1D, 2D, 2.5D, 3D, 4D, 5D (Easy, Routine, 
Difficult, Formidable, Staggering, Impossible, respectively).

Um, yes. Damn those simplistic rules. This is a situation where the
description you\'d have for something is justified under what "game
reality" would be like, but has no basis in the rules.  Fix the rules,
I say.

OK, again, yes, unless you\'d never seen a missle before, you\'d
probably have a decent point defence. However, I have an explanation
for why my scenario doesn\'t make complete sense (at the end of the post).

OK, not everyone thinks my scenario is totally dopey. Of course fighters
would act as part of a larger force - fighters alone would have a tough
time of doing anything.

It\'s not just refitting, it\'s the ability to change military tactics...
a lot of cultures in Year 0 are going to have signifigant cultural
"leftovers" from the old Vilani rule, which will make it difficult
for them to change. The Syleans have the same advantage over most of their
opponents as the US had over the Russians in the Cold War - a culture
that is ultimately more flexible, efficient and determined. I have more
ideas about this, but I don\'t have the time to post it all now...

Well, anyways, the major point of my post was not to describe a situation where
fighters will trample a capital ship. Other people have pointed out good
reasons why this isn\'t going to happen. My main point was to get away from
the other arguments that were going something like this:

A - fighterz rule! (d00d)
B - fighterz suck!
A - my 8000 fighters will totally overrun you big slow ship
B - my 16000 point defence lasers will take out your shitty 8000 fighters
A - no, you don\'t have all those lasers
B - yeah, I do
A - yeah, well, your big ships have a lower top speed
(etc)

Like, ok guys, thanks a lot. There is no way to resolve this argument
without saying "At point X in time, would a fighter be an effective
part of a naval fleet"? During the early RoM, no, fighters wouldn\'t
even exist. Would fighters be more effective during the Fifth Frontier War?
Hm, well, everyone would be pretty used to them by then, so they wouldn\'t
be a big advantage. Year 0 would be a different story though - fighters
would be something that no one has ever seen before - this is a pretty big
deal! It probably ranks up there in Imperial military history with the 
invention of the meson gun.

The fact that the rules have no provisions for possible advantages
of fighters is, IMO, a problem with the rules. Marc, if you want
to let the Syleans actually win any space battles, throw in some
rules to give fighters a hand up for a while! Otherwise it\'s back
to those damned Vilani in another episode of "Confucanism in Space".

Without setting specific guidelines to hold the discussion within, it\'s
kind of like saying "Were airplanes the dominant battlefield weapon in
history"? You really have to kind of pin down WHERE in history you\'re
talking about, otherwise it\'s not a productive discussion.

Ethan

PS I don\'t think airplanes are effective weapons - as an example, the
Roman seige of Carthage and its later conquest of Egypt.

No, I\'m perfectly aware of the difference. In fact, one of my pet peeves
are Traveller authors who is _not_ aware of the difference and blithely
assume that (for example) just because surgery didn\'t become really 
developed on Earth until late 19th Century then surgery is a TL 4+
phenomenon. Actually, all you need to perform (fairly) successful surgery
is a sharp knife, the ability to boil water plus _knowledge_ of sterile
procedures (Well, a good painkiller wont hurt). Which means that you can 
_implement_ surgery at TL 1, even if you can\'t discover it until TL 4 (a 
very iffy \'even\', btw.).

So I have no quarrel with the Darrians being unable to implement TL 16
technology just after the _Maghiz_ (in fact, I would have trouble with
them being able to do so). And I don\'t have any trouble with them being
unable to implement it for centuries thereafter. What I can\'t accept is
that they would be unable to implement it for millenia thereafter UNLESS
the knowledge entirely disappeared in the _Maghiz_. Which is what the
module _Darrians_ says happened. Even in 1100 there are aspects of their
TL 16 artifacts that the Darrians can\'t understand. Well and good. But
_Darrians_ also state that one of their five biggest universities survived
the _Magihz_ intact and assisted in the rebuilding of Darrian. Universities
are repositories of knowledge. So how did this university manage to
selectively lose some information completely when it survived intact?

And don\'t say that the TL 16 knowledge was so new that the university
hadn\'t had time to acquire it. The Darrians had TL 16 long enough to
build a lot more than three dozen starships (that was the number that
_survived_ the _Maghiz_ and a 1000 years of inattention). They had it
long enough to reach TL 17 in selected fields. And the universities 
used TL 16 to build the probes that set off the _Maghiz_.

I can\'t come up with any scenario that allows a university to survive
yet destroys the knowledge it contains. Can you?

Beta Pic is a *great* setting for an adventure - it has an incredibly
thick inner dust disk - thick enough that starship passive sensors 
(which work mostly in the IR) would have their range reduced by a factor of
ten or more. (Not due to absorbtion, but due to the increased thermal
emssion from all that dust.)

Actually, the background is zodiacal dust, at 200 - 300 K but not
optically thick; it\'s much brighter than the 3K until you get out to sub-mm
wavelengths. It\'ll vary a lot from system to system and even within a system
(since it forms in the asteroid belt and spirals into the sun, there\'s very
little dust outside the orbit of jupiter; systems without asteroid belts will
have almost no dust; some young systems - like Vega and Beta Pictoris - have
huge amounts for reasons that aren\'t well understood.) Adds a nice touch of
colour - referees should modify sensor rolls for "black sky" (no dust)
and "red sky" (heavily dusty) operations.

Redirecting the IR emission seems vaguely plasuible. You\'d end up with a
signature like an F-117 - incredibly high along narrow beams, very low
elsewhere. It would work particularly well if you spot the opponent first -
then you\'d just cool one side of the enemy and turn the hot side away from
them.

Bruce

(Still, overall Traveller does overstate how hard it is to detect people
with passive sensors; in the "real world" passive sensor ranges will be 
much longer than Traveller and active sensor ranges (probably) smaller.
This is partially a result of Traveller power consumptions being way too high,
so starships end up with gigawatts of power.)

My model for grav focussing is that the system fires a grav pulse that
travels with the beam, pulling it in by just enough to counteract the
spreading due to diffraction (this requires much more reasonable field
strengths than a point source in front of the laser would) - so it won\'t
work for sensors.

Cool! Okay, I\'ve got "looks like Earth\'s," "yellow" and "pink." I think
I\'ll assume the morning sky will be yellowish with the heat of the day

Sounds good.

Thanks for the input on volcanoes and the likelihood of that being the
cause for the sulphur dioxide taint.

Another interesting feature of Bruyere is that there is a high population
of Chirpers there. With the very thin atmosphere, my assumption is that the
Bruyerian Chirpers are a subterranean lot who live off a denser atmosphere
in natural caverns. The subterranean atmosphere would be rich in oxygen
(subterranean lichens giving it off?), nitrogen and carbon dioxide and
devoid of the sulphur compounds in the outdoor atmosphere. I have no idea
how realistic this is, but it makes for a good story!

Sheesh, I have to find _some_ way a race of oxygen-breathing mammals can
survive such hostile conditions. The fact that Chirpers and Droyne can live
in reduced life support environments lends itself to my story.

Thanks also to David Summers for his input.

on grouping fighters as a battery, ie all similar weapons and similar

batteries against incoming missiles. With advanced computer guidance and
fast firing weapons, this "floating battery" could add significantly to a
ships chance of survival and be transfered to another platform when
needed, or even screen an entire fleet if they were along or near the
approach vector of the incoming missiles. This is the tactic the U. S.
Navy uses with the F - 14 and the Phoenix missile, although it first
attempts to shoot the bombers before they can launch their warheads.

Also, this battery grouping by the fighters could greatly increase the
effectiveness of the fighters. Even in modern warfare, it is groups of
fighters attacking one target, combining the firepower. This tactic, even
though it may be more difficult in Milenu 0 against capital ships, would
be hell on screens.

If anyone would like them, I did develop a few tasks (MT system) that
relates to this grouping (ie forming up, linking fire, etc) as well as a
few designing rules that enhances these tactics.

Eek.  Well, let\'s at least use good numbers here.  Jane\'s supplies some
nice info:

air-to-air missiles max range:              150km
air-to-surface missiles max range:          650km
air-to-surface cruise missiles max range:  3000km

If someone wants to know the specific types of missiles, etc., I can supply
that.

Let\'s see, 1000 x 100km = 100,000km.  So if Traveller sensors are accurate
that far out, that\'s still way far out.

But given the lack of air resistance, what\'s the max range of Traveller
missiles?

Let me clarify.  I do want MO to have new weapons and develop a feel 
of its own.  I just want to be able to continue my 1100\'s campaign 
with the T4 rules without reinventing the wheel.

I think that T4 should have all the old weapons in it as well as the 
new.

As far as the look, you are right--MO has a feel of its own, and that 
feel is implausible.  The problem is that, eventhough MO is 1000 
years in CT\'s past, it is also over 4000 years in the future of the 
1950 AD era.   Arms in the year 0 should be much more advanced than 
conceptual designs from Terra\'s 1950\'s.

The trick is too look old for CT standards but futuristic and modern 
by present day Earth standards.

And Foss is just not pulling that off.

After some debate here on the TML, we pointed out to Marc how steep 
these curves would be and that the attrib + stat method of 
determining a target number would be too hard to obtain on some of 
these levels.

Marc ammended the difficulty list to:

	Easy		1D/Auto
	Average		2D
	Difficult		2.5D
	Formidable	3D
	Staggering	4D
	Impossible	5D

And, I hate to keep harping on it, but I want T4 to be the best it 
can be.  I\'m just not seeing that with the products that have been 
produced.

Let\'s really fix this thing and come up with a book that is 
fantastic.  Get rid of that damn half die.  Use a system like KBv2.0 
or something similar.

We keep bitching about T4\'s problems, and when we have a chance to 
really fix it, a true fix is ignored.

I\'m tired of broken T4 stuff.

Yes, indeed.

Could we please, then make very, very sure that _everyone_ writing
supplements for the Traveller world knows this well.

I suspect many authors read the list, so please note - if you put a TL13+
object in a RoM site, then you had best have a very good reason.  No TL14
vac suits, and no TL 14 plasma guns need apply.

If you need high tech goodies, there are always ancients, and other long
dead civilizations.  (I litter my world with people who got to high tech
levels, and then fell or were pushed.  I also have may legends of the
Cities of Gold.)

This is why I have fighters used a lot for anti-piracy, where all you
really need to do is get a military grade laser turret and a military grade
sensor suite out to where the bad guys are.  Civvie hulls are **fragile**,
and most pirates are civilian designs, somewhat toughened.

True - so one puts the platform as close as possible to the action where it
will not get blasted to vapor.  On the other hand, since fighters are
fragile due to size, you are usually better with a bigger ship if a small
number of fighters is not enough to handle it.  I would imagine that a
squadron of three 20t fighters is large enough to make life difficult for a
typical small pirate, and a few 100t SBDs will make life difficult for
anything up to a destroyer-sized hull.

I believe they used the baseline argument.  For the kind of resolution need
for the weapons to do what they claim, they figured out the size of the
sensor array needed.  The ship cannot easily mount an array much smaller
than the hull, unless it can handle a lot of stress in heavy maneuvering.
(I have allowed people to mount compensators, etc. for large arrays, but it
costs in space and money.)

One is usually better giving tight beam hand offs to a fighter squadron
from the better and larger sensors around, but then the maneuvers must be
planned in advance, and woe betide you if the enemy figures out your
maneuver plan.

They need one good enough to target at range.  If they use energy weapons
at all, then they will need to see what they are shooting at.

If, OTOH, you assume missiles, then the missiles get very expensive, and it
becomes important to ask whether a fighter is the best platform to deliver
the expensive missiles.

If the opposition is civilian, then perhaps.  If not, then you have a problem.

Then the weapon needs that equipment, and you get the minimum size argument
again.

In fact, given the high cost of the computing equipment and sensor
packages, fighters cost _more_ per ton than a battleship.  They are handy,
though, in that you can buy just one or two fighters for a system\'s gas
giant.  If it comes to a standing fight, fighters are not competitive in cost.

But the Battle rider that a hundred pilots and fighters are going to be
able to kill is cheaper and has a smaller crew than the hundred fighters.

True.  It still costs a lot of time to create the crew, if you want them to
be competent enough to be worth using in a very expensive small craft.

The first half perhaps, but not the second.  It always costs to train new
crew, and you always must use them in a way that maximizes their
effectiveness.

No.  Don\'t be disingenuous.

What people have bee trying to say is that the acceleration of ships in
Traveller is pretty darn close, as they only differ usually by a 10-15% at
a given tech level.

If I design a ship that might get hit by fighter waves, and I think I need
the drive oomph, then I put it in there.  These are the same design
tradeoffs that the fighter designer made, and I suspect they will be
closely related.  It will cost as much or more for the fighter squadron to
get the drive it wants.

In simple terms - fighters cost less on an individual basis, but they are
not better platforms per dollar.  They are only useful if a few of them are
good enough to solve the problem you have.

>Now, im sorry, but if thats how traveller is now, i think thats wrong.
>Also, if thats the case, why would you build anyship at all without 6g
>acceleration?

You are not listening, I suspect.  Fighters are not intrinsically faster
under the assumptions of the universe; you can build anything with high
accel.  You may choose not to.  As a result, if combat ships need to move
quickly, then they will be built with that acceleration.

You have proposed that high accel would help a fighter, but it would not
have much, if any, that is higher than the ships it was facing.  At least,
not for long.

Slow boats and pinnaces have different missions, and so they get more or
less drive.  If fighters are attacking the battleship, and speed is useful,
then they battleship would have been built with the drives it needed, and
it would cost less per gun in both money and pilots than the small fighters.

I have not forgotten jump drives.  The are big and expensive, which is why
battle riders usually win such a duel.  This is also why it is hard to
attack a fixed base - it is cheaper to build a fixed base with a given
amount of combat oomph than a jump ship.

Except that there is no air power in traveller.  None.

It is not unrealistic; it is a corollary of the technology.  If you do not
like it, propose new technology.

Hmmmm, let us take the Battleship vs the carrier analogy another step (sure
why not the horse is already dead, what will another hand grenade do?).

So You have a Carrier with 500 20 ton fighters. Each fighter carries 2-4
standard missiles. Now to add some realism let us assume that the carrier
has at least 2 (Say 2000 tons each) destroyers in the van to detect ships
before the Carrier is detected. We\'ll call this TFA (Task Force A)
The opposing force a 100,000 ton Battleship with Spinal mount, weapons bay,
screens and more. This ship will also have two destroyers in the van. We\'ll
call this TFB.

Scenario
The Destroyer screens pick up each other at long range. Since no one likes a
fair fight both call for back up. TFB pours on the power to the Battleship,
so that it can support its screen. TFA launches two waves of 250 fighters each.

Back at the main fight the Destroyers mount delay maneuvers. The Battleship
closes in to battle range. The Fighters get word from their destroyers about
the battleship. As the combat closes The battleship begins to open fire on
the destroyers of TFA. We can assume that these boys will be concentrating
on staying alive and well. Of course when a 100kt ship fires at 2kt\'s you
can assume one will die if not both. Meanwhile the fighters scream in to
outside range and unleash their missile compliment. No sooner do they fire,
than they pull up and out to return home. At this point each destroyer has
been targeted with 500 missiles each.

End result both sides have likely lost both of their destroyers. Even
battle, well not really. You see the carrier while waiting for it\'s little
babies to return whistles another task force of say three heavy cruisers. On
the other hand the battleship is sitting there with a general idea that
there is a carrier out that away somewhere.

Even if the battleship engage the fighters, at the range and speed you can
assume few fighters would be hit before breaking off, from the fight.

Fighters are not only Dog fighters, they can also hit and run from a
distance, keeping their capital ships hidden.

Hmmm.. I did not state what type of sensors were being used in example. I
was trying to point out that the a range deviation can/will have an effect
upon Fire Control solution in non idealized combat situations. Just as no
one would want to enter combat at a severe disadvantage like going in
backwards, why should approaching missiles/targets give the defending ship
a bigger advantage than possible.

Say that the missiles are programming to approach a target vessel as a non
direct manner such as crossing angle. The missile would then turn into the
proper attack angle at the last possible moment. The will allow the missile
to take advantage of "any" range deviation errors that might exist. It
would also have the have extra benefit of making it harder for the
defending ships to figure out you will be the target of specific missile.

I was making the firing prediction based upon fire control solution
estimate of future position. I did not state if the sensor was active or
passive. I did not want to muddle the example with fine distinctions. But
my impression is that any Fire Control System linked to any sensor(active
or passive) will always try to place the "bullets" at the place where the
target will "hopefully" be at based upon the accuracy of the data from the
sensor(active or passive

I also did not state the actual range to the target/missile just the range
error. So TOT will be something that you will not be able to properly predict.

But the example could be used a good reason to rotate/maneuver your ship to
bring the target\'s Z axis into alignment with one of the firing ships
batteries.

Passive sensors = greater detection range, less precision in range calcs,
and a                   longer time to calc target range, and movement.
Active sensors  = greater precision in range and movement calcs, faster
time in                   target related calc(range, movement etc.), but
range inferior to                   passives.

I am not tying to state that one type of sensor is superior to another,
just each has its weaknesses and strong points.

Hmmm...this is very interesting.

I could have sworn I saw this extended thing when i was fiddling around with

the UPP, i thought they were for the Stellar Spectra, but to my suprise i

the numbers and got different stuff.

If the attacker spins, he/she can compensate by adjusting the "mirror"
used in his laser, to keep it trained on the (projected) location of the
target. Don\'t make the assumption that the lasers are "fixed" on the
side of the ship, or that the spin rate is so high that it adversely
affects targeting.

I was referring to the *defensive* advantage of spinning. ie. when
someone trains their lasers on *you*.

Yes, the cake can be had and eaten as well.

Agreed.>>

Matter is settled as far as I\'m concerned, in Summary:

Boarding CAN take place, procedure is as follows:

Border ship MUST have higher G rating (equal is not good enough).

Border ship MUST match vector (thus there is a timing constraint, hiding in
an asteroid belt to jump ships isn\'t going to do you a heck of a lot of good
if every ship that goes by has had HOURS of acceleration applied to them,
it\'ll take you HOURS to match vector).

Border ship MUST be equipped with some sort of grappel harpoon.

Border ship MUST have greater relative mass in order to render victim\'s
maneuver (attitude jets, whatever) useless.

How much relative mass? I don\'t know off hand, I would say enough to make
reduce the victims maneuver to a point where it can\'t cause any damage with a
spin-ram.

This is a fallacy.  There is such a thing as G onset rate and smaller craft

Explain this G onset rate, it is not mentioned in the rules.

   In TNE, big ships as well as fighters can have more than 6G
   acceleration.  This is why there are no real fighters in Trav, only
   "gunboats".  If you want fighters to be feasable, you\'ll need to make
   some rules up that give them an advantage over big ships.  The
   current rules treat them exactly like big ships, only smaller.>>


I know, however in the design sequence you actuall can get more then 6G from
a small ship and still have a practical design, I haven\'t been able to get
much in a big ship.

G-compensation\'s a b**ch.

Oops, I stand corrected. Sorry my mental reality shifted and I forgot about

Nevertheless, vectors have to be matched, and if the target ship has weeks of
acceleration behind it, weeks of acceleration (by an equal G rated ship) are
required to match vectors. This would seem (to me) to make high vector space
combat unlikely, or - at least - rare.

    'body' => 'Putting on my long-unused sonar hat, I jump into the discussion on sensor
analysis...

As has been made clear by recent postings correcting and re-correcting
math on signal-strength calculations, doing these directly (with all the
exponents and area factors and the like) is a royal pain.  That\'s why all
sonar calculations are not done in terms of raw power, but rather on the
logarithmic decibel scale.  10 db is one power of ten difference in signal
strength; for example, if signal A is 100 times stronger than signal B (as
measured at some detector), then A is 20 db stronger than B.  The
advantage of doing calcs on the logarithmic db scale is that
exponentiation turns into multiplication, and multiplication into
addition, vastly simplifying the math.

To use the db scale, you need a reference power/distance point.  For
example, one could use a measured flux of 1 MJ/m^2 at 1 m from the source,
and define that as 100 db (in sonar, it\'s set in terms of acoustic
overpressure, but the concept is the same).  Now, suppose we have a source
that is putting out 100 MJ/m^2 at 1 m, and radiating it spherically.  The
old way of figuring out what its strength at 1 km would be involves all
kinds of messy factors of pi and exponents and messy things like that.
However, in our logarithmic world, we derive:

  P(R) = P(R0) - 20logR

...where R is measured in terms of the standard basis measurement above. 
Here, R0 is 1 m, P(R0) is 120 db (100 + 2*10, because the source is two
factors of ten more powerful than the standard), R is 1000m, so R is 1000,
logR is 3, and thus the power density at 1km is 120 - 20*3, or 60 db.  You
can use the relation above to convert this back into MJ/m^2, if you like
- -- but the cool part is just by looking you can see that it is 6 orders of
magnitude, or a factor of a million, less intense than it was near the
source.

Beam spreading is measured in terms of at what angle from the beam
centerline one finds a beam intensity down 3db or 6db from the centerline
strength.  A truly linear beam will not drop with range at all; real-world
beams can be modeles as dropping as NlogR, where N is typically 1-5
depending on the focussing of the beam.

So, for some real-world examples:

Passive detection:
  Rcvd power = Target strength - 20logR

Active detection, omnidirectional \'ping\':
  Rcvd power = Signal strength
                  - 20logR             // Trip to the target
                  - TA                 // Target albedo, proportion reflected
                  - 20logR             // Scattered signal back to own ship
             = SS - TA - 40logR
  TA for a perfect mirror is 0; for a stealthy craft, perhaps -40.

Active detection, beamed signal (e.g., ladar, targeting laser):
  Rcvd power = Signal strength
                  - 2logR               // Well-focussed beam
                  - TA
                  - 20logR              // Scattered signal back to own ship
             =  SS - TA - 22logR

It seems a little weird at first, but trust me, db is the only reasonable
way to talk about sensor performance.  Once you get used to it, you\'ll
never go back...

    'body' => 'Good God, you are not going to belive this.  The Emperor\'s Arsenal is 
the BEST supplement for T4 that has been produced yet.

As a matter of fact, it is one of the BEST supplements produced for 
Traveller in ANY edition.

It is the first T4 product that I am really, really excited about.  
And, you know what?  When I was reading it, I didn\'t even think about 
how much it cost ($22.50 US, for those who want to know).  It\'s funny 
how a quality product will do that to you.

Here\'s the run down:

Introduction--
The EA continues the trend started in the Central Supply Catalog of 
writing the guide like it was a real weapon\'s report.

One of the things I really liked about the CSC was that the 
"instruction" pages (the pages that tell you how to read the stats 
and such) were written like you were a Traveller character, standing 
at an info kiosk on some God forsaken planet, trying to download info 
about  the equipment.  The CSC not only told you about the specific 
types of equipment and gave their game mechanics, but it also told it 
in a way, sometimes with anecdotes and examples of how the equipment 
was used, that really gave a feeling for the equipment.  

In a phrase, the CSC was more than a bland listing of equipment--it 
related the information in such a way that you felt the "atmosphere" 
of Traveller.

This is a high complement, and the EA is done the same way.  For 
instance, there is a few pages on Imperial Procurment Practices, and 
instead of just listing info on how to read the new "weapon index" 
(kind of like the UPP, only this is for weapons) in an out-of-game 
context, the EA puts this into context by making it a part of the 
"official" Imperial procurment nomenclature for databases.

Neat, huh?

The text talks about how technologically compatible weapons are based 
on the weapon\'s TL.  For ex, you might want to use a TL 12 sight with 
a TL 11, or even a TL 13, weapon.  Imbedded in the paragraphs is 
rules for this--and parts integration too!

Have you ever wondered where they got the cR898 designation for the 
ACR in the basic book?  I just thought they were trying to 
differentiate it from CT and make it look military-like when they 
wrote that.  Yes, that\'s right.  I just thought that they made it up.

But, actually, the EA explains what this designation means.  It\'s 
that weapon\'s index that I was talking about above.

cR898

c = cartridge.  uses conventional propellants to fire a projectile of 
some kind.

R = rifle.  a weapon which is normally fired from two manipulative 
appendages of most known sentient species.

898 = year.  this is the first year the weapon was manufactured in 
the Imperium.

Isn\'t that neat as hell?



The Articles--
The EA is also full of articles on different Traveller topics.  These 
articles are full of thought and give GMs a starting point or base 
line when they start designing things to put into their game.

For example, in the Weapon Tehnologies article, they list the theory 
behind Gauss weapons AND they list the advantages and disadvantages 
to such a weapon.

I think that this is just awesome.

Here\'s a list of the articles that are in the EA:

Weapon Technologies
Sighting Aids
Tactical Roles of Weapons
Chemical Weapons
No Nukes
Ammunition Costs
Law Levels

Some of these articles even have game mechanics in them.  It is a 
great job that has been done on this book, and I can\'t say that 
enough.



New Weapon Rules--
Yes!  New combat rules!

There\'s rules for weapon malfunctions and environmental hazards (you 
know, using that pistol under water or that gauss rifle in vacuum).

There\'s additional rules (other than the few lines in the Basic T4 
Book) on visibility.

There\'s rules on Area of Effect weapons, Armor Piercing rounds, the 
Backblast rockets make, remote guidance Beam Rider weapons, Directed 
Fragmentation, Explosives, Fire Control Systems, Guided Weapons, 
Minefields, Proximity Fuses, Saturation Bombing, Smart Guns, 
Torpedoes, and Tracer Fire.

There\'s a new attack form--Burst Fire--which is like autofire, but 
you can aim too!

There is a clarification on the Rigid Armor rule from the T4 main 
book--and if you don\'t like that rule, they offer an optional rule 
for using blunt trauma damage with rigid armor.

There\'s a new rule that will decrease the damage a weapon does 
(delivering a KE attack) due to long range.

And, for all of you out there who hate the idea that, in the T4 main 
book, a body pistol can fire up to 1500 meters with an 
Impossible task, there is now a fix.  The new rule limits weapons 
based on their effective range.

For instance,  a body pistol, in the T4 main book, has an 
effective range of Contact (up to 3 meters), but with an Impossible 
task, it can fire out to 1500 meters.

Well, the new EA rule fixes that--limiting the weapon\'s range to 
Short (up to 45 meters).

And, last but not least, there is a new rule detailing zero-G recoil 
for weapons.

Cool stuff.  Cool stuff all.


The Weapons--
The weapons are laid out in sections;  each section details a tech 
level.  There are 17 sections detailing weapons from TL 0 to Tl 16.  
Both new, never before seen weapons are detailed along with our old 
favorites from the classic CT era like the Gauss Rifle, the auto 
assault shotgun, grenades, etc.

Each section starts with a few paragraphs on weapons common to that 
tech level, then there is a long listing of weapons with descriptions 
and game stats.  Some of these--many of them, but not all--are 
illustrated.

And here\'s one of the true gems that the EA offers--THE ILLUSTRATIONS 
ARE AWESOME!!!!!

No more of that crappy Chris Foss stuff!

Remember the neat illos that DGP used to put on their equipment 
sheets?  These are just as good.

Great stuff, great stuff.  You really get a good idea of these 
weapons from these pictures.  And, they all look functional.

There is a multitude of weapons in the EA, from the TL 0 Axe to the 
TL 15 Battle Pod, and let\'s not forget the TL 16+ chapter with 
fragmentary knowledge on postulated weapons and Ancient discoveries.



The Other Stuff--
There\'s a chapter by chapter listing in the table of contents, and at 
the end of the book, there\'s a multi-table listing of all the weapons 
in the book that includes their game machanics (for quick reference 
of every weapon in the book).

Just by eye-balling the lists, I\'m guessing that there is around 250 
different weapons in this book.  From cover to cover, it is packed 
with USEABLE info and INTERESTING stuff.  It\'s got great art, well 
thought out weapons, and new rules that were sorely needed.

In short, this book is a Traveller player\'s dream come true--a book 
that is as good as any that has ever been produced for Traveller.

I was trying to find something that I didn\'t like about the book as I 
wrote this review.  I try to keep my reviews honest and relate both 
the pros and cons of the products I review.

Look as I might, I could only find one thing wrong with EA, and this 
is so trivial, it is hardly worth mentioning.

What is it?  The cover art.  If they had got this right, I would 
consider this a perfect book.

No...strike that.  Even with the cover art, I still consider it a 
perfect book.

The front and back covers contain the old Foss prints again.  What 
adds insult to injury here is that they are Foss pics that we have 
already seen before in other supplements for T4.  It\'s recycled 
crappy Foss pictures.

The cover is that pic where there\'s a very phallic looking weapon on 
some sort of tower on an artic mesa jutting out from the sea and two 
giant claws are surfacing from the cold water to get it.

Dumb, dumb, dumb.  What\'s more, the weapon depicted is obviously a 
very large weapon mounted (and bigger than) on a building.  Since 99% 
of the weapons in EA are small arms, even if you like the pic, it is 
hard to draw an connection here.  This is obviously some sort of huge 
weapon that looks like it can destroy ships  in orbit on a book about 
rifles and pistols.

Hmmm.  Bad choice for the cover.

And on the back, we get that old pic of the crashed, mech-sized robot 
with a castle in the background and people walking over its fallen 
hulk.

Again, this is not appropriate for the EA even if you like the Foss 
pic.  The EA is about SMALL arms--not large, multi-ton, ship-sized 
mechs.

But, to tell you the truth, I just don\'t care about the cover this 
time.

I\'m telling you.  I\'m giving the EA my highest rating.  Greg Porter 
did an incredible job on this book.

Go get it.  I\'m not kidding about this.  You won\'t be sorry.

Im not sure if this is correct.  The only reference i have is the
boardgame "Imperium" here it states that the terrans had developed the
Missile Boat to counter the fleet wide use of missile weapons of the
Imperial Navy as opposed to the laser dominated terran navy.

Okay so lets look at the loss of life, assuming the fighters lose %50,
about 1250 pilots (i dont know what the recovery rate would be, i\'ll
assume that all the fighters are equipped with auto-eject/lifepod combos, so some
pilots would be recovered) and the capital ship lost (captured/killed)
1600 crew members, as well as two battleships which, worse yet, if they
can be salvaged equals a double loss (1 for depriving the enemy and
another 1 for the victor gaining it).

So im wondering if this would make fighters a little more viable?  I
still woudnt accept such losses (unless i could salvage something like
50%-75% of the fighters downed).

Maybe something else that can be tried is to give the side with the
battleships another battleship and add a battleship to the fighters swarm.
This way the bigger ships would have to worry about another battleship
whos hammering away at them, while the little fighters are stinging away
doing more damage than normal because of the decrease in attack potential lost.

Want to try this brad?

As a tactic i would have the fighter-battleships defense beefed up, as one
of its functions is to draw fire away from the fighters.

	It\'s THUDDD: TML Highly Unofficial and Democratic Design Derby.

	Basically, it\'s an informal and semi-organized ship design
competition wherein TML\'ers compete in designing ships.  Submissions are
sent to the person running it (it used to be me, currently is Paul Walker,
and soon will be Craig Berry), who collects the designs and then posts
them.  TML\'ers vote, and the winner is announced.  The prizes to date have
been a gold-plated ASCII biscuit donated by Commander X, and an
iridium-plated rock donated by Sir Arameth Gridlore.

	There are rule-like thingies and suggestions that could be
considered submission guidelines if this were a more uptight contest.
These are usually promulgated by the poor bozo running the THUDDD.

	If you have any more questions, ask Paul Walker at <tiger@goldinc.com>.

No.  Car "A" is the quicker car, but they are both equally "fast".

Both cars could very well have the exact same engine-- let\'s say that
they are both 350 Chev engines producing 250 hp.  250 hp will provide
enough power to allow the car to continue to accelerate until the
amount of drag on the body reaches a certain point.  At the moment
this happens, that 250 hp is exactly enough to offset that drag, as
well as any internal friction of the drivetrain.

One engine could be built differently to produce more horsepower,
allowing it to accelerate further past this point until the drag
prevented it from accelerating any further.  The shape of the body of
the car can also reduce drag, allowing greater acceleration and top
speed.  Finally, the transmissions of the two cars could be geared
differently (which is actually the main contributor to top speed
limitations).

The point that I am trying to make is that cars and trucks have all of
these limitations (they are all forms of friction); a spacecraft
operating in a vacuum does not.  While interstellar dust and micro
meteorites might produce some drag, it wouldn\'t be noticeable until
you reach VERY, very high speeds.

Why would it be more convenient to place the bridge of a military
spacecraft in a "susceptible position"?  The "Azhanti High-Lightning"
class locates it\'s main bridge near the center of the ship.

If it is a matter of being able to look out a window, sensors or a
flying bridge could handle this function just fine.  Combat rarely
takes place within visual range anyways (if it did, you\'d be in
*serious* trouble).

No.  The ship construction rules do *allow* you to build such a
battleship, though.  The limitation to maneuver drives with ratings
between 1 and 6 goes back the CT, although newer rules allow you to
partially exceed these limits.  It still can\'t be compared like the
Mach 2 velocities of some aircraft vs 35 knots for a surface ship :)

No.  Weapons each have a displacement AND a surface area requirement.
The total unused surface area of the hull is what determines how many
weapons can be conceivably fit.

A laser is a laser.  A battleship with a few *hundred* tunable lasers firing
40 times a minute, could destroy entire armored divisions.  A single 7kl
missle body could contain dozens of "flying crowbars," a guided kinetic-kill
weapon.  There are many options open to the ship\'s Captain concerning ground
support.

If the need for gross damage is seen, spinal mounted Meson guns will provide
a suitible demostration.

Remember, these weapons are designed to hit targets up to a light-second
away, at relative velocities measuring thousands of km/sec!  Tagging a few
hundred grav tanks from low orbit will be easy.

They would be most useful over the FEBA (Forward Edge of the Battle Area,
where the forces were intermingled.. by being down in the dirt, the
interface fighters could pick off "sprinting" grav vehicles and attack
suspected headquarters.

However, the apperance of fighters tends to make everybody in range empty
their weapons skyward.. and you never know when you\'ll be hit by a
one-in-a-million shot.

Then why not fire this weapon from a nice, heavily armored bay on a BB or

It takes six weeks to train a Navy gunner.  It takes six years to produce a
fighter pilot.

Huh?  The Luftwaffe was critically short of pilots from 1943 on.. after
about September \'44, the skies belonged to the allies, because the few
remaining pilots were on bomber intercept duty.  The Japanese had to take
untrained cadets and strap them to flying bombs since they had run out of
instructors to teach dogfighting.  Most of the Kamikaze were making their
first solo pilots!  The Soviets would accept almost anyone for pilot
training, and since it meant getting away from the German Panzers, they
never ran short of volunteers.  Since the availible pilot pool was much
larger than the supply of aircraft, it left the impression of a larger air
force, but look at the actual number of planes flown... less than 1500
throught out the war.

The pilot shortage in the US was so desperate that the US Army Air Corps was
forced to allow African-Americans the chance to fly.  One black unit, the
99th Pursuit Squadron (The Tuskegee Airmen), became one of the most
decorated AC units in the war.

The space on a BB is better spent on weaponry.  Planetary squadrons make
some sense, in that they could at least act as pickets.

If you live to get close enough!

A crude example.  I\'m a trained sniper, I can hit a man-sized target out to
about 800m.  I\'m sitting with my trusty M-21 in the middle of a large, flat
area.  You, and 40 friends, are armed with .50 Desert Eagles, range about
40m.  If those suckers hit me, I\'m dead, but I\'m wearing a flack suit, so
you\'ll have to get close enogh to hit an unprotected portion of my body.

Your group starts 1km from me.  I\'ll probably notice you right off, since
there is nothing to hide behind.  At 800m, I start shooting.  At that range,
I might pick off one or two of you.  As you move closer, my accuracy gets
better.  Withing 100m, I *will not* miss, and unless enough of you remain to
completely overwhelm me, I will kill you. 

See where this is going?  It\'d be much better for y\'all to use a .50cal
machinegun, which can penetrate my armor, and hit me at longer range,
without endanger yourself.

*Sigh*  It\'s all relative motion.

Right now, the Earth is revolving at about 900mph.  If I run east at 8mph,
does this mean that I\'m running at 892mph?  No, because relative to the
Earth, I\'m only doing 8mph.  The same thing in car crashes.. If two vehicles
hit head on and 50mph each, the damge is going to be consitent with a 100mph
collision.

If my Battleship (3g accel) has be boosting to a speed of 90,000kmh, and
your fighter (6g accel) is boosting on a parrael course at 30,000kmh, to the
fighter it will appear that battleships is pulling away at 60,000kph.  A
fighter traveling straight towards the battleship at 90k/kph, will see the
battleship flash by at 180k/kph.  Speed is simply a function of acceleration

Do you drive a top-fuel dragster?  We can build and run IC-engine ground
cars that can drive at 300mph+, but those are specialized applications.  The
two small craft you mention are not intended to be warships, they are
designed as passenger/frieght haulers.  By installing less poerful drives,
they save space for the hold.

Most military ships will have high G ratings, simply because there comes a
time when running is the best option.

Changing horses mid-stream..  Being familar with both battles referenced, I
can safely say that in neither case were the carriers denied their air
wings, in fact in the Glorious\' case, the pilots fought deperately.

Nathan Bedford Forrest, and the orignal quote was: "Be there first, with the

Weapon mounts are only limited by surface area and power.. nothing else.

  There\'s also the concern of powering the targetting systems (whether
they be independant or semi-independant) as any person who\'s designed
missiles using FF&S has already figured out...unless you put a fusion
powerplantor some other source of power (such as solar cells) the missile
must have enough batteries to power the guidance package for the intended
duration. (In case you\'ve been wondering, I\'ve done a lot of thinking on
this subject; mainly on the possibility of using missiles as mines)

Emperor\'s Arsenal has a good Classic Traveller field to it.  I was reminded
of the Ironmongery section of Book 4.  The interior art is very nice, and
very Traveller.  The illustration for the ARC-5 stuck out as good example.

It does have many of your old friends, gauss rifles, personal laser

is even a SMG version of it.

I never thought of using fighters as a single battery before and it
*does* make sense!  As long as there isn\'t any solar flare activity or
powerful jamming going on, it should work OK.  There would be limits
to the size of the battery, of course, but fighters *could* increase
their value to a fleet using this rule.

As for someone else\'s comments of adding up the surface area of the
sensors on multiple fighters to form one large array, this also makes
sense.

It appears my maximum AAM range was off due to the conversion between
imperial and metric... the figure I saw must have been in miles.

Would you mind sharing the type of ordnance for your second example?
I did explicitly state "fighters" and not something that came out of
the belly of a B-52 :)

Infinite... as long as they have sufficient fuel to make the necessary
course corrections when targeting an evading target.  Target
acquisition would most likely have to take place within *someone\'s*
maximum sensor range, of course.

You started your scenario with two more-or-less equally balanced task
forces, and after the loss of both fleets\' DDs, you admit that it is
still a draw.  But then you disbalance things by reinforcing the CV
fleet with three CAs... your whole example then shows the threat of
becoming heavily lop-sided.

Upon the two fleets\' DDs spotting each other, I would imagine that not
only would the BB accelerate to meet its DD screen, but that the DDs
would attempt to fall back somewhat to gain the protection of the BB
and delay the arrival of the fighters.  Doing so would draw the
fighters in a bit closer, allowing the DDs to relay to the BB a decent
bearing to the enemy CV (a good tactician could even gauge to range).

Ignoring the additional CAs from the scenario, the BB could then steam
on ahead with a good idea where the enemy CV is located.  We now have
a potential battle between a BB and a CV in the midst of retrieving
and rearming her fighters.

More likely however, the BB might decide to wait and call in three CAs
of its own to fill in as pickets for its lost DDs.  The battle at this
point would be a draw.

I wouldnt have them depend on energy weapons, as they wouldnt be as
effective as missiles.  Laser would be more for dogfights.

True, but the loss of the fighter (as a delivery platform) as opposed to a
cruiser also has to be considered.

We have similiar targeting systems today, they dont add a significant
amount to the weapons size, and your saying that by the 50th century
(earth time) they wouldnt have miniturised to the  point of insignificance

This may be so, but it was beyond the scope of the initail argument

No once again you didnt read the argument, we used a predefined
battlerider with a predefined fighter class (1 man fighter).  So this

During world war II the british could produce about 100 competent pilots

And what ive been trying to say is that, if accelration is the only
measure of agility/manvr. its simplistic.  I have also been trying to say
that if you have a system where it doesnt cost much more (or even
cheaper!) to build a highly manvr. 100,000t battleship as opposed to a 10t
fighter, thats also to simplistic, nay, perhaps ludicrous?

WHich is fine, i dont mind because traveller can easily be modified and
its a role-playing game not a wargame.

I am listening, reread what i said.  If thats the way it is, thats fine,
but, to then assert that it will cost (comparatively) as much to build a
battleship as fast/manvr/ and accelrates as a small 1 man fighter, than
thats a little odd.

SCOTT!  READ IT ALL!  We were at that point speaking about carriers and
battleships in the real world, thats why i use the symbol for Carrier
Vehicle CV.  Were not talking about space at that point.

they could (I can\'t comment on MegaTraveller, since I do not own the
actual rules).  The T:NE "Fire, Fusion & Steel" technical sourcebook
probably did more to emphisize "hard science" in the Traveller
universe than any other book prior (or since).  No expense was spared
at attempting to explain as much about the Traveller universe as
possible using what we know NOW in the late 20th century.  Some
hand-waving was necessary (gravitics, jump drives, T-plates, meson
guns, and the like) to follow earlier canon, but attempts at
explaining these technologies appeared realistic enough to satisfy
most "gearheads".  In short, FF&S is based on as much scientific fact
as GDW could squeeze into 160 pages.

=46F&S is still probably the most widely used set of rules used to build
spacecraft for the Traveller universe (note that the various ship
construction rules for T4 have been designed as to be backwards
compatible with FF&S).  Since its many formulae and charts are based
on some scientific fact, it is somewhat difficult to argue the final
results of anything built using these rules-- and this includes
building fighters capable of taking on big capital ships.

The effectiveness of laser and target acquisition technology have
already been discussed in depth, as has the fact that big ships can
carry better sensors and lasers than fighters (size and power being
the main issues).  And regardless of how powerful a missile\'s warhead
might be, the problem still involves getting it to survive long enough
to get within its own effective range.

You *could* also hand-wave some sort of powerful direct-fire fighter
weaponry (throwing the "hard science" feel of Traveller out the
window) but you would have to make them short ranged-- otherwise the
big ships would use them too.

Much of the fighters vs. capital ships argument has been hashed out
before on the beta list, with many knowledgable participants.  As
Merrick mentioned in one post a few days ago, current technology (and
the physics which governs it) was found to be far more effective at
generating kill results on small targets such as missiles and fighters
than anyone on the list had previously thought.

Lasers capable of firing 800 shots over a 30-minute game turn (which
_can_ be built with FF&S) have been mathematically proven to be
extremely lethal to nearly anything inside 30,000km.  While the
survivability of targets beyond this range increases, the problem is
that all missiles (even nuclear-pumped X-ray laser warheads) *must*
close to well within 30,000km to affect the target.  Such warheads are
moving directly at the target and are easy pickings for such a laser,
which would have a considerable amount of time to do so (especially
regarding those that must close to a much shorter distance).

If a laser can do this to a swarm of missiles, it stands a good chance
of doing the same to a swarm of far more expensive fighters.  The only
advantage for fighters here that I can really see is the ability to
launch more missiles at once.  The question then becomes a matter of
comparing which of the following is more cost efficient:

1) outfit a vessel with "X" missile turrets & missile bays

   ...or...

2) using the same space and surface area required for step #1,
   provide room for "Y" fighters (and their hangers), as well as
   the space for a couple of launch tubes

Option #1 allows massive missile volleys to be fired on nearly every
Combat Round while Option #2 would allow an even larger missile volley
once every couple of game-hours or so (assuming that the fighters
launch _all_ their missiles at once).  I think Option #1 is probably
the most efficient, although Option #2 would be better off when
dealing with foes with REALLY impressive anti-missile defenses.


Making Fair Comparisons (part I)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Traveller space combat cannot be compared to modern-day aerial or
naval combat, since all three operate in different mediums.  A vacuum
offers no drag, which allows for much higher velocities but also
prevents the medium from interacting with the craft for purposes of
maneuvering.  Translation: the Traveller rules pretty much can allow
both small fighters and large capital ships to be built with similar
maneuver and agility ratings, so any advantage a modern fighter has
over a naval target is stripped away.

Air and water provide drag (limiting maximum speed, depending on the
medium) but also provide the necessary counter-force for maneuvering
and acceleration.  This difference in speed and maneuverability is why
it is ridiculous to even compare aircraft vs. naval power (let alone
space combat)... they are just too dissimilar to compare fairly.  We
could try to go one step further and compare your average infantry
company to an A-10, but you can see where this is going :)


Making Fair Comparisons (part II)
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you truly want to compare two subjects, they must be done in a
controlled environment.  This is basic scientific protocol, and would
apply to any military testing as well.  To determine the effectiveness
of using fighters vs. using larger capital ships to prove a point, a
government would demand tests based on their biggest concern: cost.

Eliminating all factors similar to both sides (escort screens, support
ships, tenders, repair facilities, drydocks, starports. etc.), all you
are left with is the comparison between a 1GCr jump-capable battleship
and a jump-capable carrier & its complement of fighters (total cost:
1GCr).  Since all other factors would remain the same, the question
would boil down to "which is the better \'bang\' for the \'buck\'".  The
inclusion of a carrier (or starport) in the comparison is *essential*
in any such evaluation; leaving it out would be the same as denying
the battleship its jump drives, missile & fuel reloads, damage
control, frozen watch, crew quarters, long-term life support, etc.
(besides, the fighters have to move around from system to system
*somehow*).

Then, and only then, could you determine how effective fighters would
be against large ships of various size.  It might be determined, for
example, that a small pocket carrier and her fighters would perform
better than a small cruiser of the same cost, while proving inadequate
vs. a larger vessel (a larger carrier with more fighters would have to
be used for the latter comparison, of course).


Closing Statements
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

=46ighters still have a role in tackling less dangerous targets, and
because of this, the enemy will probably be using fighters, too (these
enemy fighters could also be engaged).  Fighters also work well for
anti-piracy functions, being cheaper to operate than a larger vessel.
=46inally, they are nearly infinitely flexible, meaning that 500
fighters could easily be divided up into smaller groups, depending on
the needs of the situation (where a big ship simply *can\'t* be sent to
two or more places at once).

One of the problems with a "hard science" RPG like traveller is that
true technology is often far scarier than you would tend to believe.

Thats when you have time to spare, in a major war 6 years is not the time
it takes, not at all.  The major powers of ww2 turned out pilots over 
about 2-4 month period.

But the point is they had pilots, it was all relative, but they had
pilots.  I never said they would be crack veteran crews.

Im not familiar, but i would have to guess that the battleships came in
within there gunning range, which is a death sentence to a lightly
escorted or unescorted carrier.  Doing this defeats the purpose of the
carrier.  If i was the captain of the Missouri and i knew i was going in
against the Enterprise, whos location i dont know, id be worried.  Of
course im sure someone will say they\'d rather be in the Missouri, but
thats life:)

Never assume.  Your assuming that death is related to health, which is not

Book 1:  T4 Main Book		RATING  3
Cost  $30.00;  190 pages.

The T4 main book borders on a rating of 2.  There\'s a lot wrong with 
it.  Since I recognize that there is a lot of good in it too, I give 
it a middle of the road rating of 3.

What\'s Good?  
It has a detailed contents and index, reflects that 
good old Traveller feel in many areas, modernizes the Classic 
Traveller rules in many areas, and has a good and logical set of 
skills.  

There\'s a good listing of basic equipment, both new to the 
game and old, in the book.  Likewise, there\'s a decent amount of 
vehicles that you would expect in a basic game. 

Much of the book is taken directly from previous CT Traveller rules, 
word for word.  There are places, though, where they did not convert 
to the lower-is-better standard for rolling very well.  



What\'s Bad?  
Character Gen tries to be good, but ends up screwy with 
problems--notably the EDU problem.  Typos run rampant throughout the 
book.  The art runs from pretty good to down right awful.  Although 
the task system is the best design I\'ve ever seen for Traveller, it 
uses awkward half dice and has probability problems with Staggering 
and Impossible tasks.  Of course, this is easily fixed, and my own 
KBv2.0 task system keeps the general feel and great design of the 
task system and fixes the problems all at the same time.  In my 
opinion, a fixed T4 task system, like KBv2.0, is one of the best I\'ve 
seen for a role playing game--certaininly the best that Traveller has 
ever seen (even better than the very good system in MT).

The space combat system is confusing and unusable--use Mayday or wait 
for them to fix this.  In the Animal Encounter section, they forgot 
to tell you what target number an animal needs to attack.

And, the experience point system just sucks.  It uses some good 
ideas, but characters using this system will become super human in 
just a couple of adventures.  There has to be a system devised that 
makes it harder to increase your skills.

There\'s also the Core subsector listed in the book, but the stars are 
in the wrong place from where they were in the CT game.



What\'s OK?  
The combat system is OK.  It\'s simple and fast and still 
gets the job done.  It\'s a good basic system that can easily be 
added to later with more detailed rules.  I like more detail in my 
combat systems, but this is a good building block.  For those who 
like quick combat systems, they can use this basic one.  For people, 
like me, who don\'t like to be bogged down for an hour rolling a 
combat round, but want more detail in their combat, this system in 
the T4 book is a good place to start--then add more detail to later 
with other supplements (like the EA).

The spacecraft design rules are somewhat broken but playable.  It\'s a 
quick, basic system that leaves some questions unanswered.



In Sum--
I\'d say go ahead and get it.  You kind of have to to run a T4 game.  
You might want to wait until the new revised edition comes out, but 
I\'m starting to have reservations about this one as well.  There\'s a 
golden opportunity here to fix some of the things wrong with the T4 
main book, like the awkward, unwanted half die in the task system, 
but it seems that Marc and IG won\'t consider another system that 
fixes these problems.







BOOK 2:  Starships		RATING  1
Cost $22.50;  107 pages.

This book was a major dissapointment.  The only thing that it has to 
offer that is any good is the starship design system (which I 
understand is somewhat broken as well--you can get the corrected 
version on the net).

This system is a more detailed set of starship design rules.  Other 
than that, you get several pages of crappy art, minimal description, 
and some of the worst deck plans I have ever seen for any game.

I stopped in the game store today and looked at the Babylon 5 RPG 
called The Babylon Project.  In the back is a starting adventure, and 
they give some deck plans for ship used in the adventure.

IG should take a lesson from this.  These deck plans were incredible. 
 They were these 3 D deck plans taken at a three quarter point of 
view.  You could see all of the equipment, what the walls looked 
like, how high the ceiling was--everything.  There is no doubt about 
what the inside of that ship looked like.  I thought to myself that 
this would be great for Traveller.  A player asks what at room looks 
like, and you pull out these plans.  It would be just incredible.

Just so there is no mistake, here\'s what I\'d like to see in T4 deck 
plans.  I like the 3 D concept.  I\'d also like a detailed 2 D set so 
that the far side can be seen as well, and I want to know what the 
outside of the ship looks like.

The deck plans in DGP\'s Starship Operator\'s Manual were incredible 
(although not as good as the 3 D ones in the B5 main book), and I\'d 
be completely happy with these.  I also liked the illustrations done 
in the SOP showing pertinent areas of the ship like bridge, 
engineering, a stateroom, etc.

My recommendation on Starships?  Don\'t get it unless you just want 
the starship design system.  Even so, you should download the 
corrected version of the system from the net.







BOOK 3:  Central Supply Catalog		RATING  4
Cost $22.50;  93 pages.

I really like the CSC.  The entries are written with a style that 
makes you believe that this equipment is real--not just the 
traditional bland equipment lists prevalent in old Traveller 
supplements.  It\'s got a good list of equipment (in fact, just about 
everything ever designed for Traveller in previous products--I went 
through all of my old stuff and checked!), a short robot design 
system, and a detailed vehicle design system.

I would have liked to see the equipment, especially the armor, taken 
to TL 16 like the EA has done, but even as it is, the CSC is a good 
buy.  I highly recommend it.







BOOK 4:  Aliens Archive			RATING  3
Cost $22.50;  106 pages.

The AA is a pretty good book.  If you want to add some diversity to 
the races you use in your campaign, then this is the book for you.  
This book holds details on 12 alien races including the Newts from 
CT.  It is done in the tradition of the old Contact articles in the 
old JTAS.  There\'s even a page with some real good art done for each 
alien.

Among some minor problems, there are two things that stand out as 
negatives to this book.  One is that all of the aliens are depicted 
without clothes, arms, or equipment.  Although there is a lot of info 
on each of the races, we don\'t really know what they look like.  It\'s 
like seeing a Vargr without any clothes.  You might assume they never 
wear them, which is definitely not true (the Vargr are notorious for 
their choice in clothing), like I do for all 12 of the aliens in the 
AA.  For instance, from an old JTAS article, I know that the Newts 
wear clothes, but in this book you would think that they are just 
humanoid, monster-like, lizards.  Although the drawings are good, I 
get the impression that these aliens would be better suited as D&D 
monsters than Traveller aliens.

Another thing that gets on my nerves is that there is not much 
differentation from humans in the sections that describe how to roll 
up the stats for each alien.  Aliens that look massive and are 
described as having massive strength roll 2 D6 for Str, just like 
humans do.  There should have been more care and thought put into the 
game mechanics in this book.

In sum, I do recommend the book if you want to populate your campaign 
alien, alien races.  You may even want to allow players to use one of 
these races as a PC--espeically if you are tired of everybody they 
play being one of the six major races.  It\'s a good change to play a 
minor race.







BOOK 5:  Milieu 0				RATING 3
Cost $22.50;  110 pages.

M0 is actually a good book, and I\'d give it a 4 rating if I was 
playing in the M0 campaign.  I\'m not, so I give it a 3 rating (I\'m 
playing in the CT 1100\'s ear), but I still think that this book has a 
lot to offer any campaign.

The biggest asset this book has is its sheer volume of information 
packed between its pages.  Every topic imaginable is covered from the 
rise of the Third Imperium to the role of the various Imperial 
organizations to power structures for a M0 campaign.  There is a lot 
of info here.

The biggest liability to this book is that it has little actual game 
value.  You\'ll read this book one time (and this will greatly expand 
your M0 campaign background), but it is not the type of supplement 
that you keep going back to.  Read it once.  Digest the info, and 
that\'s it.

I recommend it if you are playing in M0.  It gives you a lot of 
background for your campaign, but it is not the type of background 
that you can use to make your sector of space that you are playing in 
more detailed.  It\'s history kind of info.  You\'ll know who is 
pulling the strings, what the general role of the Imperial Navy and 
Scouts are, and the procedures the Imperium uses to contact new 
worlds.

If you are not playing in M0, buying this book is a judgement call.  
I\'m glad I bought it for my 1100\'s campaign, but I doubt that I\'ll 
use it directly.







BOOK 6:  First Survey			RATING 0
Cost $22.50;  109 pages.

This is one of those books that you will hardly ever use.  It is pure 
crapola.  All it is is a set of incomplete maps and world data.  On 
top of that, the world data is broken because the last two digits of 
every world\'s UPP (the government and law codes) are exactly the same 
on EVERY world listed in the book.  If a world has code 7 government, 
it has a code 7 law code.

So, all this product is is maps and world data.  The maps are 
incomplete--not showing starports, trade codes, and the other map 
details (basically, the maps tell you the world location, and that\'s 
it), so the maps are not useable.

Then, all of the world data is flawed--unusable because of the double 
digits in all of the UPP\'s.

Basically, First Survey is totally unusable and a waste of money.  It 
is definitely one of the worst supplements EVER produced for 
Traveller.

You know what my recommendation for this product is--stay as far away 
from it as possible and burn your friend\'s copy.

Marc Miller should be ashamed that his name is attached to it.







BOOK 7:  Emperor\'s Arsenal			RATIING  5
Cost $22.50;  110 pages.

On the heels of one of the worst Traveller products in Traveller 
history comes one of the BEST Traveller products in Traveller.

For a complete review, see my post from earlier today.  Basically, 
The EA is just incredible as a listing of Traveller small arms both 
old and new.  The only thing I could find wrong with it was those 
crappy Foss front and back cover pics, but the info...the info is 
fantastic.

I can\'t recommend this book enough.



If you have any specific questions about any of these Traveller 
products, then feel free to e-mail me in private.  I\'d be happy to 
help you out in anyway I can.

I personally like the TL14 space suit, as I believe that Terran material sciences would be far 
supior to the Vilani. Peferably I would use the Worldbuilder\'s Handbook staggered Tech level, 
as that was more realistic than the blanket TL that Traveller used.

They should be -- it\'s the same artist.

EA\'s interior art is by Bryan Gibson, assisted by
Ashe Marler and Steve Bryant.

Many persons on this list will remember Bryan\'s
art from numerous 2300AD and MegaTraveller products.

The Battle Pods bring up a point people might
want to know -- Battle Dress (powered armor) has
apparently been shifted down the tech scale by two
or three levels. By tech 14, state-of-the-art in
front-line personal battlefield protection is a
cramped pod -- essentially an enclosed, armored
grav-bike with sensors, ECM, and alotta guns.
However, I would expect there to be advanced forms
of traditional Battle Dress at TL-14,15 to handle
less-intense combat and garrison roles.

The Ancients\' artifacts are deliberate "GM 
reservations/playthings," so use them as you
wish however they might fit into your campaign.

Well, I\'d add:
   Inconsistent use (again) of dashes and hyphens to
represent negative signs;
   They missed some use of boldface type in the 
explainations of the meanings of the "x[Y]Y000z" 
nomenclature, which confused me until I saw the 
parts where they *hadn\'t* missed it, and backtracking 
what boldface was missing became trivial;
   The weapons technology section on p.21 is formatted
to have a short introduction, but instead dives right
into the text -- thus the first paragraph is inexplicably
separated from the rest of the text, since there\'s no
logical break there;
   Neither the First or Second Imperia beat TL-12 
(with perhaps some localized exceptions), so TLs-13-15
should NOT be "Second Imperium technology." Among old
ROM stuff advanced TL-13 stuff will be exceedingly rare
(and valuable [this advice provided free to slow GMs ^_^]),
and TL-14,15 nonexistent. Those running Classic, Rebellion,
or Virus-era campaigns will find it useful, though.

But, except for the last, these are basically nits.

The BB\'s Task Force shouldn\'t even need to do that, as the Fighters would
need to take a fairly direct route to get there in time to do any good, so
the bearing is "straight behind" the Fighters (and you can just track them
back to the CV, anyway). Likewise the CV\'s range can be calculated based on
likely reaction times, and the Fighters\' G rating (assuming your spy boys
have done their jobs :). Personally I wouldn\'t want to be anywhere on that
Carrier, CAs or no CAs when that Battleship gets there.

"Jump takes 168 hours (+/- 10%) to complete. this time is related to the 
nature of the alternate space being travelled in, and to the energy 
applied. Where time is a variable in travel in normal space, energy 
consumption is a variable in alternate space; time is a constant. 
Consequently, distance depends on the energy applied."

This may seem like a simple question, but the rulebook doesn\'t seem to give
a clear answer. If a career has skills listed down the bottom area (ie:
below the skill tables), do they get those skills only once (ie: the first
term the PC takes that career), or do they get them every term. An example
of this is the Scout career, which has JoaT and two other skill clusters
listed (I can\'t remember what they are off the top of my head). I can
rationalise both ways, but I was wondering what the "official" word is.

Cheers,
Jason

Sensors are area dependant.  There is a physics limit on how small
they can possibly be.  Mass is not an issue (and their weight

Then it was a stupid set of assumptions.  Cost is what matters.  The
tonnage you take out matters not, it\'s the _cost_ (men and machines,
both).

How long does it take the US Airforce?  (funny I\'m on this side of
things :-)  Actually, pilots are passengers anyway, the computer
will be doing all the evasion and fire control, the pilot tells it
where to go, and what to shoot at----sounds like a job for a robot

They\'re a scarce resource indeed in traveller (all the naval char

results may have varied).

You obviously don\'t know what acceleration is.  A ship has  position
in space.  If that position changes with time, it has a velocity (a
speed, plus a direction).  If the velocity is changing in time, then
it is accelerating (either the speed, or the direction of movement,
or both may change).  Period, there is nothing else to lump in with
acceleration (angular acceleration works the same way, but with
spin, but it doesn\'t change much (except the rate at which a given
ship can change facing).

No, it\'s not.  I have an uncle with a speedboat, he couldn\'t
possibly keep up with CVN-65 (the Enterprise).  Not even at the
speed the Navy will admit to.  

Traveller drives require energy, and powerplants take up less mass
as a percentage of total mass for bigger ships.  Also, mass overhead
(structure/armor/etc.) for a fighter eats up a huge %.  This is the
killer.  Fighters, by definition, are equipment dense.  They have no
space wasted, it\'s all there for the job at hand, delivering
weapons.  The problem is that that role uses dense materials, so
getting acceleration becomes harder.

Remember that acceleration = Force/mass  up the mass, drop the
accel.

See above.  And sure, it will cost less to make *one* 6g fighter
than *one* BB.  The problem is that for 10,000MCr, you can get a big
ship, but not near an equal tonnage of fighters.  Each fighter needs
to replicate all the gear on it\'s neighbor, where the BB can
economize on many features.  A fighter with one laser, and 4
missiles that has one active, and one passive sensor has 0.2 sensors
per weapon.  A BB might have 25 sensors, but maybe 25,000 weapons
(calling each missile a weapon as per the fighter)----that\'s 0.001
sensor per weapon (sensors ain\'t cheap).

Why bring up current stuff if it has no relationship to space then?

    'body' => 'An interesting historical note----there are fighters, even carriers
in traveller.  Hell, a BatRon of Tigress BBs has 2400 fighters just
from the BBs!

An these are 50ton heavy fighters!

A major role for these in a T-plate world is chasing down SDBs,
right? (they\'re hiding, so you need to spread out to find them)

The problem is that on order to even bother chasing down the SDBs,
the SDBs need to be dangerous (else why bother).  Traditionally SDBs
are no bigger than destroyers (Sup9 says 5ktons, right?).

In HG, missiles will scrub off weapons (maybe take out the drives).
Once the BB\'s meson gun is below factor 9, the ship is useless
against meson screened foes----BOOM!.  This is a rationale for
missiles, but not fighters (the fighter volume, plus its share of
the tubes, quarters, etc, on the carrier would be better spent on a
missile bay or two, then).  The added delta v of the fighter is a
major plus, however for deploying missiles at long ranges when you
are unsure about the path of the enemy.

I would suggest using nastier missiles.  The trick is that they
can\'t be too cheap, or all the missile bays would be full of them.
They also might not have a very good chance of ever hitting.  But
the knowlege that they are out there drives the escalation of ship
defenses (PD weapons, screening ships, etc.).  Remember that I\'m
trying to explain why history is as it was presented to us!

So, as I see it, SDBs, and some fighters are loaded out with
"torpedos."  Torpedos would be missiles big enough to hurt a cruiser
or better.  Ignore your screening, and you\'re in trouble, but under
normal conditions torpedos get shot down long before they get close.
Skimming (with it\'s limitations (that _should_ be there :-) on
sensors might be a good place to get torpedoed.  This might explain
small SDBs.  They need to be at the right place at the right time to
have a chance to actually hurt something, so make lots of them.
I guess a nule detonated on contact would count as a torpedo
warhead, that or a small missile with huge delta v.

Otherwise, SDBs should be big-ass battleriders with huge spinal
mounts.  Anyway, get SDBs nasty and fighters exist for no other
reason than to kill SDBs!

Carriers would stay near the big boys and let the fighters screen
for SDBs.  Defensively, they could cover large volumes of space and
do some damage to in-jumping intruders.  In that case, insystem
patrols by defending fighters would be at high velocities )perhaps)
to allow them to shoot and be gone faster than the enemy can build up
speed.

In a full-blown fleet furball, the fighters would act as missile
bays----perhaps flanking the enemy so that they are forced to split
up their PD fire (I know that Batt. Bearing rules would make that
not a good idea, but what the hell :-)

They can at least shoot down incoming missiles, too.

Ah, the renowned "Golden BB Theory."  This was a tactical air-defense
doctrine recommended by Soviet advisors in poorly-equipped client states,
whose air defense weapons had not the least chance -- individually! -- of
downing a modern US aircraft.  So, the theory was to *fill the sky* above
the ground target with missiles, AA fire, BB-gun pellets, thrown rocks --
anything that could be lofted -- in the hopes that the attack planes
couldn\'t help running into *something* just by sheer dumb luck. 

Golden BB defenses worked partially for Libya in the mid-80s, and not at
all well for Iraq in 1991.  The theory was first honed over North Viet Nam
in the 60s, but there the technology gap was a bit smaller, and the number
of SAMs available much larger.

Actually, it\'s even weirder than that.  If the two cars have equal masses,
and hit in such a way that they just crumple into one another (no
careening/spinning off to the sides/flipping over), the crash will be
*identical* to each vehicle hitting an utterly solid wall at 50mph.  Think
about it -- each vehicle decelerates from 50 to 0 in a few feet, in each
case.  This is one that a *lot* of people have trouble understanding, but
if you do, you\'ll have a far better handle on the physics of motion.

Acceleration *times* time, actually, and you\'re already travelling at
0.99c in any number of arbitrary inertial frames.  Any mention of \'speed\'
has to explicitly or implicitly contain "relative to X" as a modifier.

Of course, Traveller has the odd twist that there are two ways to \'run\'. 
I can see large ships being built with lowish g-ratings (like 2-3) on the
theory that (a) the party doesn\'t start \'til they arrive anyway, (b) 
lower thrust/power requirements leave more room for weaponry, and (c) if
things get too hot, they can always jump clear.  Smaller vessels, which
will more likely be used in pursuit and interface roles, would tend to
have higher accels (4-6).

I\'m not shure resolution is the issue in sensors. Perhaps it is sensitivity
and that depends on collecting area, not resolution. The VLBI approach used
by radioastronomists creates a virtual telescope with a huge diameter
(giving high resolution) but the collecting area is the sum of all
individual telescopes areas.
Astronomers don\'t care much for collecting area as they can integrate over
long times - a luxury space combatants cannot afford for obvious reasons.

Exactly, but i tried to remain within the bounds of the argument - hey i

would be quite effective, he then asserted that in teh gulf war the USA
only used cruise missiles!  sheesh, i did my best is all.  If you dont

Conservation of energy (a big issue according to canon) while jumping from
one floorfield to another. What is your potential energy while in a
floorfield? I\'ve had a teleoprting PC die because he teleported from within
a floorfield way back when that issue seemed important. Now I don\'t have PC
with psionics so it is still a problem. Any ideas on how to solve this?

Or more proper logaritms is the way to go in sensors. Actually one should
use logs in all areas of gaming as it simplifies to hit, damage,
penetration et c. Whn I switched my systems underlying principles to log
values (6 years ago) I finally came up with something that could be used on
fistfighting to space combat and everything in between without resorting to
persinal hitpoints, vehicular hitpoints, minor hits et c.

A laser is a laser is attenuated by atmosphere, affected by clouds etc.
Thrown ordinance has flight times which will be a major factor. And then
there\'s the horizon factor to consider, to be effective the big ship has
to sit in a fairly predictable orbit. I can\'t see the old rule that you
shouldn\'t put ships up against shore defences being any less valid in
Traveller. A deep seated meson gun will make short work of a capital
ship in the ground support role. Submarine based missiles and lasers will
be very effective, fixed sites almost as good. The big ships just won\'t
be committed until the surface defences have been neutralised. The best
way to neutralise them is by using ground troops, who need support in
the meantime.

A big nuclear missile is likely to be more effective, or even (at risk of
starting another pointless debate) the time tested game of "drop the rock".

No it won\'t. detecting something in space is easy, detecting something in
an atmosphere is much harder. In space you have a nice featureless background
against which things stand out like a sore thumb. In an atmosphere there are
lots of things to hide behind, lots of ways of reducing your signature.
Things in an atmosphere have far less predictable vectors. Things in an
atmosphere can throw up things which can blind your sensors. You can\'t hit
what you can\'t see. Remember that those thousands of km/sec velocities are
mostly straight lines, things in an atmosphere rarely move in a straight
line for long. As an example way back in the seventies the US held an invasion
exercise against the Iranians (back when the Shah was around). The Iran Navy
totally creamed the US by using hovercraft towing very large aluminum
kites, basic reaction of the US sensor operators "What the hell is that?"
The point of this, interface operations is going to be a specialist role
for which your capital ships are just not going to be designed or trained.
Is that contact real or just a ghost? think fast because your only a few
hundred km\'s away and they know where you are (planet based sensors are
a lot better than yours). If you\'re wrong you are likely dead.

Frankly I\'d rather run the million to one risk than make a very valuable
battleship (or cruiser) a sitting duck. So what ships will be used in
interface work? As I see it: firstly there\'s my beloved fighters, great
for direct support; then there will be the bomb ketches, smallish (destroyer
sized or so), not quick (2 maybe 3g), armour that would not go amiss on a
dreadnaught, heavy on other active and passive defence, best sensors you can
fit, armed mostly with missiles; and finally your strike cruisers, basically
scaled up bomb ketches, bit quicker, bit less well defended (they have to be
able to engage in space combat too) for deployment after the fighters and
bomb ketches have neutralised the planetary defences. The battleships are
not deployed until the closing stages, by which time its all over bar the
shouting.

Actually, I don\'t think that the look of 1950s US cars was technologically
motivated. Therefore M0 vehicles etc does not hve to look futuristic but
I\'m actually playing the devils advocate here; I too dislike the look of
the M0 stuff, especially the weaponry that IMO are NOT dictated by fashion
except hunting weaponry, knives etc. I was just arguing the point that it
would be cool to have stuff from different eras look different
stylistically.

And I\'m just stating that one of the advantages of actives (better range
measurement) is not very important when shooting straight beam attacks. All
you have to do is measure the angular velocity (have a rough estimate of
range (to get a ballpark figure for your TOT) and shoot at the spot on the
skydome. If target is 300 m further away so what? It\'ll hit the target one
millionth of a second later.

You\'ll need to know the location of each fighter to within one half
wavelength of the measured photons to do synthetic aperture stuff but I
might be way out on deep water here (somebody correct me on this issue if
I\'m wrong).

One advantage of multiple sensors cooperating is that range calculations
for passives will be much better (some poeple on this list think range

 Are you saying that flying a spacefighter relying solely on sensor data is
as easy as flying a WWII aircraft? Please don\'t give us some crap about
expert systems, VR-augmentations et c. It is a historical fact that air
superiority planes have gotten harder and harder to fly as time progresses.
I\'m not saying that they\'ll get infinitely hard in the future but I think
you cannot take fior instance some farmboy on a desertplanet and drop him
into a space fighter wothout at least a years training.

People tend to do analogies with bodern day stuff like fighterplane engines

in a fighter has to do with the time to spin up the turbine. In Traveller
you flip a switch and you get full thrust right away.

You mean "Rank and Service Skills?"  These are received as part of basic 
training/orientation/officer training/etc.  So, characters only get them

whatever), they don\'t increase their skill level any.  They just get the 
skill level listed (i.e., for Noble, Charisma-1 and Fencing-1), because 
the basic training or whatever just teaches level-1; they\'re not going to 
set up a special class just to teach level-2 to a couple of recruits. [G]

Thank you very much :)

If you have any suggestions on how to implement the different TL for
difference components, I\'d love to hear it.

As far as jump capsules are concerned, they are from Classic Traveller,
Striker Book 2. Thus they are non-standard, and your design may not be
legal in a T4 tournament if you use them. Basically, jump capsules are
armored pods that allow soldiers to perform combat drops into hostile
territories from orbit. They have been canon in every version of Traveller,
including T4 ( M0 talks about the Sylean capital being built pyramid shaped
to repel Jump Troops ), but I believe Striker was the only system that
provided rules for them.

I\'ll try to give a short outline:
After finishing Gymnasium (last 3 years of school up to 13th grade), 
most of us have to do military or civil service (male only).
After that, we\'re free to go to university on any subject we choose! 
Legal studies take 8+X (our own choice) semesters. After that we take 
a number of written and an oral exam. After that we have to take an 
internship with a court, a firm, etc... 
That qualifies us for some areas of legal work.
Then we may take the second exam, again written and oral, which 
qualifies us for judge duty and most higher posts.

I don\'t understand: What is the differance between "the light given off by
the star" and "the heat of the star itself". The light given off from a
star is perfect blackbody (ie temperature radiation) minus some absorption
lines from various atoms in the outer part of the star.

Official Proclomation is that it is illegal, but in this case (that being

The map is almost useless to me, since ist leaves out most of the

starports in a referee-only book?
The sector data is, well let\'s just say not very well printed! It 
takes up too much space (font too large etc.) Also, i find that there 
are too many Ancient sites. There are more sites than 
in the entire SM-Sector, the professed "hotbed" of Ancient activity, 
whith the largest (not anymore???!) number of sites!

One further Question: What will happen to Zhunastu enterprises? Since 
it won\'t be there as a MegaCorp in 1105+ anymore, there\'s room for 
speculation. Did it go bankrupt (not likely) or was it destroyed with 
the death of Cleon the Mad or didn\'t it survive the Civil war (again, 
not likely, since the Civil war didn\'t affect the private sector

Why thank you. Like you I do believe fighters have a place in Traveller.
I don\'t see them as the dogfighting versions beloved of SF movies, more
as the space equivilant of Fast Attack Craft. The carrier as I see it
is not carring F/A-18\'s, but something closer to a Osa or Tarantil <sp>

There\'s a maxim with artillery, it goes "Don\'t tap it, thump it". Orbiting
battleships would be *very* good at thumping things. However as you point
out there are problems with ortillery (orbital artillery). The atmosphere
makes targeting difficult; assuming that most ortillery will be missile
fire (or more likely smart deadfall) there\'s a time delay; it relies on
having your big ships in orbit where they are vulunerable to planetry based
fire; its not as flexible as direct support; and probably most important, it
doesn\'t have the same morale effect. There\'s something very comforting for
the troops on the ground to be able to physically see their support. It
might be nice to see a concentration of enemy troops or a bunker disappear
from orbital fire, but the troops would most likely prefer to see a squadron
of fighters roar overhead. It just makes them feel safer, regardless of the
reality of the situation.

I\'d agree here. Missiles regardless of launching platform would be "smart"
missiles. They might be terminal guidance (they get close, activate their
own sensors and locate and lock on), Radiation Homing (rely on active
emissions of the target, the classic ARM missile, good at taking out your
enemies active sensors), or semi-active homing (rely on illumination of the
target by another source). Fighters could use either terminal guidance or
radiation homing. The fighter still needs to have some sensors (you have
to know roughly where the target is). They\'d have to be passive (better
range and less likely to assist the enemy targeting you). This makes a
fighter a missile launch rack. Esentially increasing the survivability
of your armarment by spreading it out over a larger area and making the
launchers individually mobile. A very rough analogy might be an artillery
battery in a dispersed battery site (heavy emphasis on the rough analogy).
The question here is does the increase in survivablity make up for the
increased cost (both in Cr and tonnage) of the figther support facilities?

Here\'s an interesting thought. If Thrust plates emit a range of unusual
particles (SSDS), why not build a missile with a guidance system which
homes in on them? The traveller equivilent of a Sidewinder. If you switch
off your thrusters you become a sitting duck. This gives the counter
measure of thruster flares.

Sorry, I hadn\'t been following the full thread. Any admiral who would

As an aside, the Japanese at the end of the war did have very big problems
with finding pilots. They had started the war with the best pilots in the
world, but had an inadequate training system and couldn\'t replace their
losses. They went to great lengths to avoid using pilots in kamakazi attacks
(generally unsuccesfully I might add). The crews of the kamakazi aircraft
weren\'t pilots, they were a missile guidance system; trained in bulk to
take off, fly a very basic course and crash (they were not trained to land),
They were trained on the ground, many of them never took off in an aircraft
before their actual mission.
Incidently the during the 2nd WW the British developed a very effective
system of missile guidance based around trained pidgens, capable of taking
individual bridge supports over 1,000km. It was never deployed. Apparently
the British high command was heavy in bird fanciers, and as the pidgen died,
they considered it to be just not good form. The worlds first (and only) PGM
(Pidgen Guided Munition). Just another bit of mindless trivia, but I\'m sure
an enterprising traveller umpire could work that one in somewhere :*).

Its not the problem of finding new pilots, its the problem of training them.
At least two years, which goes a good way to negating the speed of
construction advantage. Plus you have to devote considerable resources to
maintaining a training establishment, pilots are training intensive.

An interesting idea. It comes down to do the advantages of the fighters
(increased survivability of your missile batteries and increased flexibility
of role for the missile batteries) make up for the cost of the fighter
support facilities? Under HG I think it would, I\'m not sure about FFS or T4.

As to operations around a planet, its a whole different coffee pot of
herrings. Here the fighter does make sense. The ranges will be much closer,
the big ship is deprived of it\'s range advantage, the fighter can hide by
skooting down into the atmoshpere. Here you need a carrier with your own
fighters to deal with the planetry based fighters. Even a 2000Td destroyer
is going to have to think very careful about following fighters down into an
atmosphere.

>>Oh and BTW the last classic battleship dual was in the Pacific in 1944.

Guadalcanal. But no it was Surigao Strait. Fuso and Yamashiro against
Tennesse, West Virginia, Maryland and Mississippi; 24-25 Oct 1944. The
Japanese lost.

Exactly, the fighters don\'t "kill" the ship, but weaken it so another big
ship can easily. But in this role the fighters would have to stick close
to your own big ships for protection. Here the analogy is torpedo boats,
they hide behind your battle line and dash out and launch a stand off
attack. Think of the classic torpeodo charge. They don\'t even have to
actually inflict any real damage on the enemy, just launch enough missiles
to occupy them for a bit, giving your big ships a tactical advantage.
There are certain systems which just have to on or near the surface. Things
like sensors, drive exhausts, weapons etc (not incidentaly the bridge, the
modern CIC is put very deep in the ship); and these will be vulunerable and
the loss of them will really hurt.

I\'m not really qualified to comment. I\'d see the average battleship as
having 4 or 5g acceleration, so the fighter would have a slight edge, just
enough to act as a torpedo boat. However I am not that familiar with either
T4 design or FFS to make a good judgement. I still use HG. I\'m not that
interested in indepth ship designs, I regard it as a distraction from role
playing (No value judgement, just what I personally prefer).

As someone has pointed out, in M:0 this may not be true, ships might not
have a good secondary anti-fighter armarment. However as soon as fighters
appear, they will get one PDQ.

>Also, if i remember corecctly the High Guard rules had a limit on the

As I understand it, no its not. The limit now is volume and surface area.
But then again, I still use HG. It produces ships I regard as good enough
and allows me to conentrate on what I prefer (roleplaying). I\'ve yet to
see any PC\'s in a ship which can slug it out with even a 2000Td escort,
so as long as the rules reflect that, I\'m happy :*). Any rule system that
gives the PC\'s a chance of taking out a 100,000Td battleship is fundimentally
broken IMHO (not that any traveller system does as far as I\'m aware).

NASA doesn\'t actually have an array like this right now. (JPL does,
but I\'m not sure that counts.) A few other groups do...all on the ground,
where you can physically connect the telescopes. For this to work you need
to know the distance between the spacecraft to within a fraction of a
wavelength of light, which is hard to do for spacecraft that are
trying to fight.

We (CORE) prepared a set of data and maps, per instructions, for M0.  We 
were told that FS would include our data as well.  Instead, it was decided 
that our data and maps should be removed, and the FS data and maps put 
in.  Thus, what you are seeing in M0 is actually the data and maps 
created by Marc Miller for the First Survey product.

Why is it not likely that a business would go bankrupt in the course
of 1100 years?  Other than the Roman Catholic Church, a few assorted
monarchies, and a few other religions, I can think of very few
organizations that existed 1100 years ago that exist now in the same
form, if they exist at all.

I think the Navy admits to something like 40 knots (any squids out
there?).  Stories about "rushing to a liberty port" abound in
sci.military.naval at some absurdly high speed.

Ships are still a bad example, though, since watercraft have a
maximum speed based on their length (longer is faster).  Small sea
craft need to go to hydrofoils to avoid this (leave the water, avoid
the length = speed thing).  The point of bringing it up was that in
the case of a CVN (or any nuke ship) they have huge amounts of power
to give to propulsion.  Per unit mass, they have to generate more
energy than a speedboat----that is the link to traveller.  Big ships
have huge powerplants.  Give that energy to propulsion and you\'re
gonna accelerate.

Since a BB is less dense than a fighter it has a better thrust/mass
ratio.  Fusion+ might help out here, however.  \\

Hmm.  I like the idea of actives falling off fast, but providing an
r value (distance) to the target.  This becomes important for meson
guns and missiles, both of which need to hit a target in 3 space.

It might be interesting to have a "passive lock" and an "active
lock."  Passive would allow direct fire (\'cept MGs), and MG fire at
a -DM.  Active would allow MGs to avoid the -DM.  Missiles could
home on targets only with better data, other wise they\'d be bearing
lanched, then would home when they get closer.  Of course it makes
little difference since the passives can triangulate distance pretty
quickly sinc the sensor platform moves fast enough to create a good
baseline in a few seconds.

I\'m willing to believe that an aircraft carrier can outrun a speedboat.  I
believe a ship\'s speed is, at least in part, determined by its length at
the waterline, although I can\'t say I understand the physics of this
phenomenon (I think it has something to do with the ratio of drag at the
air/water interface, versus the overall volume of the hull - which might
have something to do with the speed of submarines, too - but I\'m really
in, uh, over my head, hydrodynamically-speaking, and am probably at least
partially wrong).  Racing yachts are often built with a "reverse transom,"
to increase their length at the waterline, without increasing their length
overall (which, I believe, is important for determining which races
they can legally be entered into, for arcane reasons).

That turns out not to be the case. The University of Zlodh is the principal
university of the Zlodh Basin, the Darrian equivalent of a continent. And
_Darrians_ makes it clear that it was engaged in physical sciences (One
of the two "Star Trigger" projects was run from it). It is not just arts

There were jump capsules on board the Kinunir (Adventure 1 I think)
although I do not remember how much detail they had re; rules.  

"I sat in my cocoon, unable to move.  If the ship were hit at that moment
we would have all bought it, never knowing what hit us" ... "We moved down
the slide, precisely like cartridges in an old style automatic pistol."

Paraphrased from Starship Troopers by Robt Heinlien.

The idea is for a battle dress equipped trooper to be transported to the
ground in a low-visibility, quick, and unpackaged a way as possible.  

The trooper climbs into her or his capsule and is strapped in six ways
from tuesday against the G forces of launch and decelleration.  The
capsule itself is made of an ablative material which will absorb the heat
of reentry as it passes through the atmosphere.  No brakes, no manuver
drive, just a big egg with a nasty suprise inside.

When launched on a ballistic trajectory (a difficult task for the pilot of
the troop transport) the capules are generally sent in at a relatively
high velocity, brake by friction with the atmosphere which is when the
many ablative aouter layers peel off like some bizarre onion, leaving an
inner non-ablative shield around the trooper.  Hopefully this occurs
*after* all necessary velocity has been bled off.  The inside of the
ablative fragments are treated so that they reflect radar energy.  This
has the effect of giving any ground controllers thousands of targets -
most of which are fragments - to waste ammo or time on.

When ready (or not) he trooper triggers the first of a series of
parachutes to break the inner capsule.  The first one lasts only a second
before detaching.  Then the trooper will break out of the capsule and use
the second parachute - again just for breaking - on the back of the BD.
Depending on how hot the LZ is they may use a third chute to float down or
use Grav or boot jets for final breaking - before they send their heels up
through their spine by landing the hard way.

In addition to the fragments of shell, the ship will generally launch a
number of "dummy" capsules after the troopers which, being lighter, hit
atmosphere earlier and fragment quite nicely.  Even more false targets.    

All this is recalled from Starship Troopers rather than CT, so take as you
will.

This was sort of my hidden agenda when quoting this source. One additional

by one of my players regarding the state of computer technology
in the Imperium.

I thought I\'d ask this list and get some comments before coming up
with an answer for him.

Here are his questions, along with my answers:
Do programmers do the same sorts of things as today? I\'d say no. The 
programmers of the far future would tend to deal with concepts on
an abstract level. I\'m thinking of an extension to the current idea
where people tend to program in very high level languages. Not many
people still write machine code or assembler.

What does the code look like? I\'d say that the "code" is a series
of objects and relationships. Programming involves creating objects
and relationships through the use of pre-packaged modules and VR
interfaces.

Are data-nets (a la the Internet or the World Wide Web) common? Yes,
although the time lag between solar systems makes for data
synchronization issues.

What sorts of encryption and security are used? Generally one-way but
I\'m not an expert in this topic.

Is VRML or true virtual reality common? Yes, most applications (at
TL13+) use VR interfaces.

Are there such things as mainframes anymore? What do they do? I think
that mainframes will always have a place. Besides, as the Imperium
expands, the frontier areas won\'t have the state of the art technology.
So you\'ll find mainframes in remote areas. You\'ll also see them in
workplaces requiring high levels of security.

What sorts of operating systems are there? None that we would 
recognize. Operating systems, as we know them, will operate without
much direct interaction with the user. Users will use complex VR 
interfaces to get things done.

What do starship-specific computers do? Are they specialized like 
auto-engine computers or general purpose? How much variation is there 
between ship computers? I suggest that starship computers are as 
simple as can be for the specific job they need to do. I think of a 
model/1 as basically a very large 286-based PC. That\'s all the 
horsepower needed to make jump calculations and run the ship\'s
functions. The advantage to having this simple technology is that
you can buy software/hardware for it throughout the Imperium,
without worrying about the tech level.

Any ideas you have are appreciated!

Well the fastest nonhovercraft or nonhydrofoil US naval vessel, that I have
personal direct information/experience, is a current aircraft carrier.
Speed greater than 40 knots by more than a few knots. I served on a
Spuance(spelling?) class destroyer that was involved in a "race" with other
naval vessels in the Sea Of Okust(misspelled for sure) called the "Dakota
Dash" during the "Dakota Run". As to who won well there was some cheating
involved so the winner depends upon which side of the cheat you were on ie
winner or loser. My ship was exceeding 35 knots with all GT\'s on-line and
in "Battle Override" mode. The sight of rooster tail of water coming off
the stern was "most impressive" to say the least.

I don\'t know how much the new ship design sequence has changed 
things, but using FFS it was certainly possible to design a <10disp 
ton fighter with weapons which could penetrate an armour value of 
1200+, at least at TL14/15. Using Battle rider for approximate armour
values, it appears this laser could penetrate the armour of any ship 
apart from the Sylea. I\'m not sure how well this translates to the 
new system, so the quote above may be more accurate. Still, if 750MJ 
lasers without grav focusing are still allowed, then fighters can 
damage even very large battleriders.
If anyone is interested, then I could repost the design, but it\'s TNE 
not T4.

This is basically true. For small weapons, at low TL, lasers really
beat meson guns, even in FFS/BL. Meson guns don\'t start to win until
targets are big and have enough armour that lasers can\'t do more than
scratch their surface.

QSDS/T4 ship combat exaggerates this effect, since armour can always be
wittled down (blech), and since multiple laser weapons sum to one big
laser battery - that means that even for big ships, lasers probably beat
meson guns until you run out of surface area for more laser turrets.

Don\'t know which University survived but how about a massive EMP wave
followed by a massive heat pulse. That takes care of much of your on-line

heat wave hit, and the contribution they made came from their personal

well-known Dr. B. F. Skinner, of operant conditioning fame.  He trained
pigeons to peck at the center of a picture (aerial photo of a factory, let
us say).  In the bomb, the pigeon would peck at a little viewsceen that
showed a picture of the ground below transmited through lenses.  Since the
pigeon pecked at the center of the factory, if the image shifted off
center the pecking shifted off center and the guidance mechanism of the
bomb would correct course so the picture was in the center of the screen
again.

  The system was rather ingeneous, using simple feedback mechanisms to
keep things on course, and in the few trial runs the bomb worked rather
well.  The rejection of the system had more to do with the mindset of the
military officers involved rather than any love of pigeons - they just
thought the whole idea was silly and refused to fund it further.  Perfect
way to give a low-tech society precision-guided munitions.

  This was the second most interesting paper I ever heard at a Society for
the History of Technology conference (the most interesting was a
technological history of the vibrator, but that\'s another story), in part
because of audience participation.  The conference room for this paper had
a rather large window on one side, and outside was ledge.  Turns out it
was a major pigeon nesting site, and when Eric was delivering his paper
(and only while he was delivering his paper, I might add), the pigeons
swirled around outside and thumped against the galss.  Maybe they had
family members who worked for Skinner...

  I think Eric eventually published his paper - I\'ll have to see if I can
find you folks a reference.

	I suspect there will be varying levels of abstraction...after all
SOMEone\'s gotta build those basic building blocks, but anyone other than
some very specialized people will be way above the hardware level. In
fact, more than likely, a lot of those basic building blocks WILL be
hardware. After all, what would be the fastest way to have a system run,
but put the \'compiler\' in hardware.  Given that TL-12 and up computer
systems will probably be some sort of 3-d optical system (the higher
bandwith needed will almost certainly require optical light wavelengths)
and some really incredible complexity can be built into a system like
that, a lot of what we think of as \'software\' will be hardware.

	I think so, the code may resemble something like the current
popular notion of VR interfaces, a la Johnny Memnonic, Lawnmower Man or
Disclosure. Notice I said something LIKE, not necessarily those. There are
prototype systems in use today, for instance that allow analysts to \'fly\'
over a field of objects representing stocks, bonds, or other financial
instruments, with various variables affecting the shape, \'height\', color
of them, so that very large arrays of data can be navigated rapidly and
accurately.

	The T4 main rulebook already says this...basic worldwide wireless
data nets are an integral part of TL-12 technological society. This will
be a giant bummer if they find out that low level radio emissions DO cause
cancer and stuff :-/

	For ideas on stuff like this check out some of the stuff that\'s
been done on \'smart cards\' and cashless societies. There are systems out
now that can conduct anonymous electronic transactions. I don\'t have the
references right in front of me right now, but a lot of work has been done
by some Dutch researchers. I read about it in various articles in American
Scientist and scientific American. I even visited their web site once, but
ost the bookmarks somehow.

> Is VRML or true virtual reality common? Yes, most applications (at

	Almost certainly. As descendents of arboreal, fruit eating
primates, our senses of sight and touch are the most sensitive we have. An
interface that combines those two is going to be far more effective than
other ones, since it taps into reflexes that are pretty much genetically
fixed in us. Moreover, if neural interfaces become common these are the
only interface tools we\'ll have, except that aural cues will become more
common. In fact even now, people are starting to wake up to the importance
of aural information...there are experimental systems now that let you
\'browse\' large data sets as sounds. They have found that people using
these can attune themselves to incredibly small variations in the data by
distinguishing differences in the sound.

	I don\'t think that there will be a distinction, per se, between
\'Mainframes\' \'PC\'s\' or whatever, but rather the amount of processing and
data storage will probably go up and down in scale...and a single
installation will be extremely difficult to tell from a distributed one.
For instance, right now, I can open up one folder on my desktop and be
looking at five or six different computers, with three different operating
systems, represented as folders of files I can work on...

	In an intensively networked environment, the distinction between
actual locations and virtual locations may become very separated.

	All of this detail really depends on how computers are used in
your campaign. Computers have always, to me, been an incredibly weak spot
throughout Traveller, along with cybernetics. Computers and datanets play
an incredibly vital role in a society like that of Milieu 0, but the
details on using, ( and mis-using) this technology is largely undetailed.
How does a VR cracker break into a high security site? How do you go about
finding out information on someone? Are there systems you can feed a
photograph into and ping out pops a list of likely people? Where is this
information kept, who can get to it. etc.

	Comparisons to cyberpunk genre games start creeping in here,
leading to the 64,000 Cr question...why ISN\'T Traveller cyberpunkish?

True, but in my mind, there\'s no difference between a fighter and a bomber
of today when compared to a Traveller fighter.

 Note: expected design mod to increase range to 1000km (unconfirmed)

So if you\'re looking purely for fighters, then around 600km is max
(possibly 1000km).  If you\'re willing to include bombers, then 3000km.

Ouch!  That\'s what I thought you meant.  I have a photograph (not a poster)
of the F-23 on it\'s maiden voyage.  I still can\'t believe they picked the
F-22.  In any case, the AF is having a roll-out ceremony for the F-22 soon.

Slight?  ;-> Over 50,000 for a Rolen Politess, almost a million for a
200sdt Free Trader, and *millions* for bigger ships.  Seriously, the
difference is 90% of the internal sturcture/armor cost, and that\'s no small
potatoes...this might be the difference between profit and death for a
small trader.

You\'d better shout that loudly.  Lot\'s of people are mixing and matching,
and the conversions aren\'t too bad...except for prices.

During WWII the vast majority of fighters were piston-engine prop jobs with
fixed machine guns.  The only difficult thing was teaching landings.  A
modern pilot of a F-16C, or a F/A-18, needs to be able to operate the radar,
on board targeting systems, manage fuel supply, and stay alert in an
envoiroment that is far more deadly than than that faced by a combat pilot
in 1944.

Now project forward.. An Imperial fighter pilot will have to be skilled in
piloting his craft, running the sensors, and engaging the enemy in complete
isolation over a period of hours!

Take a look at the loss rates for the Luftwaffe from mid-44 on..  You need
well trained pilots, or it\'s pointless.  Unless you have the Japanese
Kamikaze, most of the poorly trained fighter pilots are going to break and
run when the first couple of friendlies fireball.

Considering that the heaviest anti-ship weapon on board the Enterprise can\'t

According to Bruce Petters (Sex and the tail fin, 1985, some sort of strange
psych journal that I will get the ref from when I unpack) 1950\'s cars were
designed as sexual symbols, specificaly, phallic ones. Makes you look at the

To be as serious as I get ( not very), once technology is out of the lab,
it\'s design takes on a life of it\'s own. The market will decide what it looks
like, despite any logic of use, at least in the real of the general consumer.
Military contracts may be more strict as to "form follows function", but
general consumer goods will follow fads. 

Before the flames hit, think about it, why are jacks for your mouse and your
keyboard on the BACK of your computer? Why is ketchup, a highly viscous
condiment, served in narrow necked bottles? There was a brief attempt to sell
ketchup in wide mouth pots, but the public rejected it.

The point (<large cheer!> he may shut up!), is that once you know the minimum
dimensions of any piece of equiptment it\'s shape is entirely up to you and
your concept of the world that created it.

My understanding is that those evaluating the program were aware of
the atomic bomb (still secret at the time) and killed it because
they felt that the atomic bomb would mean that accuracy didn\'t
matter.

In the EA on page 11 there is chart for converting Damage Ratings to USP

I have found the a file on Joe Hecks site [Traveller Answer] Armor Values.
But the T4 to USP is off in the [Traveller Answer] Armor Values a T4 value
of 16 equal to USP of 10, but in EA a damage rating of 16 equals 0-0-0-0.
What I am trying to do is convert some values I have for nukes warheads
into USP values. The values I want to convert are greater than the table in
EA. No I do not have Starships for the USP table that is in there. I will
maybe buy it after the "new and Improved" system get out.

Thats what id be designing. Emmision guided missiles, maybe with an
inteligent detonator so if they do kill there thrusters it will retarget
or sit and wait.

Another possibility would be neutrino guided missiles that go for the
power plant (?)  These are the only two thing i could think of that would

Very true, then you would be looking at the big advantage a fighter would

In T:TNE there are drop capsules used by the RCMC that fit this model almost
exactly.  The only difference is that they are given a micro-flight computer
similar to those on Grav Belts with a thruster pack for re-entry.  These are
launched out of a dispenser similar to Heinalins (sp).  After re-entry
troopers either use a parachute or a Grav belt depending on the world of origin.

They come in basically four variations: Mk. I, IIa, IIb, IIc
        I is for troopers,
       IIa is for decoys
       IIb is for deadfall ordanance or missiles
       IIc is for material (ammo, food, gear etc.)

Each pod costs ~350kCr and is .5 Td
They weigh between 8 and 18 tonnes, are AV 10, .75G with 4 min fuel
Pods are equipped with 5 decoys of IR, Laser, and EM (each, 15 total)
and a .04 MW battery 

They are unfortunately (duh) non-reusable.

        Perhaps what we need to do is to try and duplicate the QSDS lasers 
in SSDS. All of the QSDS components should really be available in SSDS.

there is a tilde character before the jamesd, rather than whatever junk

Yes, I do come off a bit strong.  It\'s just that we have no problem 
tearing IG a new hole when they do something wrong.

If think that if they do something right, then we should be just as 
passionate about telling everyone about it.

Too many times, people focus on the negatives and forget about the 
positives.

In my book, the EA is just incredible.  They did a wonderful job on 
it, and I want everyone to know it.  

I sure hope IG continues this trend.  Besides, it was damn refreshing 
to buy a T4 product and really, really like it.

What can I say?  I was pleasntly surprised, and I\'m excited about it.

Kenneth.

Actually military equipment follows fashions just as much as any other, in
both aesthetics and philosophy. Take a look at the M16, and the Styer AUG -
both have styling that has nothing to do with their function (though the
basic underlying shape does). The US Army was sold on the M16 because it
looked sexy as much as anything else.

This applies to major hardware as well, and a good number of perfectly good
aircraft and ship designs were never produced because those doing the paying
thought they were ugly.

On the other hand, you could use optical lasers for messaging over

   Actually he would be in radio/maser contact with his wingman...err
wingperson and of course his squadron commander and probably the other
members of his squadron.  You\'re right though--the cockpit of an
Imperial fighter is probably going to be more complex in some ways than
a modern day aircraft.  On the other hand, it will also be easier to
operate.  Holographic displays, automated systems, voice activation,
etc. will lessen the burden on the pilot.  Assuming the Imperium shuns
such advances already on the horizon on TL 8 Earth, there is always
another solution: crew your fighters with two people instead of one or
three instead of two.

   In the early grim days on the Russian front, Soviet pilots would ram
their fighters into German bombers in order to stop them.  Eventually
the Soviets figured out how to clip the tail or wing of German bombers
and leave their own aircraft intact enough to bail out (one obsolete
fighter for one modern bomber plus crew--result the Soviets win the
exchange).  Point is that the Soviet Air Force stunk up the air in \'41. 
They got better as the war progressed, in constrast to the Japanese
naval air and other air forces which got worse as the war progressed.

   You need well trained pilots to act as a cadre for training the new
recruit pilots as they enter the air.  The Americans and Soviets had the
luxury of numbers which allowed them to send their best pilots to the
rear where they could act as instructors.  Not having to relearn from
the same mistakes and getting the straight crap on what the enemy\'s
fighters can and can\'t do (and what your own fighters can and can\'t do
versus what some manual says) saves lives and many hours of additional
training.

   In general, battleships ruled the night in WW II and carriers ruled
the day.  A carrier alone at night were a sitting duck (which is why
they had crusiers, destroyers and even battleships as escorts), just as
a battleship alone during the day is a sitting duck (which is why
battleships stopped going anywhere without air cover--at least the ones
that survived the war anyway).  The two complimented each other which is
why the Americans combined them in use.  

   As for waterline armor, the Enterprise (of WW II fame) couldn\'t even
give the Missouri a bad hair day.  Its guns are defensive only.  A
flight of dive bombers from the Enterprise on the other hand could send
the Missouri down *quickly*.  waterline armor does nothing to protect
deck, which is where the dive bombers\' ordinance would be penetrating. 
Aircraft represent the entirety of the offense capability of a carrier. 
Neutralize them during WW II (whether on account of darkness or because
the flight deck is non-functional) and a carrier can do little but bend
over and take it.

   Modern aircraft carriers can operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
in any weather that naval combat can be attempted.  Because they have
overcome the major limiting factor on their operations (darkness), they
have made battleships obsolete.  If we project things into space,
carriers must be able to carry a number of fighters capable of disabling
or destroying enemy capital vessels, whether by penetrating the enemy
capital vessel\'s hull or by saturating it with fire to the point that
all of the enemy capital vessel\'s sensors and commo antennas are
disabled (rendering said vessel as good as dead).  If fighters are
incapable of this, carriers are obsolete for purposes of space combat. 
While they would make excellent mobile bases for ground support
fighter/bomber operations, and good in-system scouting operations
centers, you wouldn\'t see them In Harm\'s Way (John Wayne movie).

Harold

As this is all taking place FAR into the future, what changes would there

    'body' => 'Back in CT days, the advantage of the fighter was blatantly obvious --
100 10-ton fighters have 100 hard points, the same as a 10,000 ton
warship. Unless you had lots of independant little batteries to throw up
a wall of AA, you\'d get pecked to death from surface damage. This is
obviously no longer the case; if the weapon fits, you can carry it...
but I still think there\'s a role for the fighter that no one has
considered.

Nevermind cost-effectiveness, or \'scrubbing\' versus taking ships out in
one shot via spinal mount, or differing fleet tactics, or the chances of
a surface hit turning into an internal explosion (the golden BB rule),
or the manifest superiority of fighters for close support of ground
forces. I\'ll leave all that to the rabid Trav-gurus and the tournament
junkies. What about if your enemy simply outranks you in the tech
department?

My planned campaign has relatively low-tech Terran colonists (TL10; i.e.
tech in the realm of the foreseeable future) versus nasty aliens that
are considerably more advanced than they are (TL15). The aliens have
some kind of fiendish weapon that reproduces the effect of a particle
accelerator WITHIN the target area (read: meson guns). This is unhealthy
for big expensive capital ships, as the humans find out in their first
pitched battle. Warships blowing up from the inside out. Catastrophic
collapse in morale. Tax dollars down the drain. Humanity is doomed...

...or would be if it weren\'t for the surviving carriers, who were away
on patrol when the BEMs launched their interplanetary Pearl Harbour on
an unsuspecting humanity. You see, fighters are agile enough to make the
enemy miss more often. You have a harder time blowing up lots of little
dudes than one big one with your miraculous ray gun. And best of all,
most meson weapons (with the obvious exception of the monster-sized
spinal mounts) are intermediate-range weapons -- fighters can be
launched at longer ranges than the alien\'s nightmare weapon can reach.

A couple of years into the conflict, and the humans are still getting
their asses whipped, several inhabited systems are toast, the taxpayers
are still loudly annoyed at what it costs to fight a prolonged
interstellar action... but it is no longer an unequal battle. Because
those annoying humies are deploying a truly mindboggling array of sensor
drones, cruise missiles (robot kamikaze planes as large as a small
conventional fighter), reflex pods (small robotic fighters carried by
larger interceptors that are slaved to the fighter\'s own sensors & fire
control and can be sicced on threatening targets -- think of a reusable
Phoenix missile that can shoot back instead of just blowing up once),
and other nasty goodies designed to be deployed (key disclaimer here) AT
RANGE. 

With these and other force-multiplying \'semi-automated\' accessories,
every fighter is itself an aircraft carrier in miniature, cutting down
on losses of valuable personnel. Every ship is first and foremost a
(small, fast) fighter carrier, with some secondary function designed
into it. They are escorted by missile boats (another standoff weapon),
and launch a plethora of specialized fighter types. And the individual
fighter jock (read: PC) is a verrrry important person. Good roleplaying
possibilities -- which is why I dreamed up this scenario to begin with.

The key point here is that -- for a low-stellar civilization fighting a
high-stellar one -- I couldn\'t think of a single viable military or
economic alternative BESIDES the fighter. They\'re cheap, easy to repair
or replace, fast, relatively hard to hit, and offer tremendous
flexibility. The more you put out there, the more their sheer numbers
offer protection to each other and saturate the enemy\'s defenses. A
fighter wing offers a battleships\'s firepower, but with the ability to
zoom around from spot to spot and target its \'batteries\' on different
enemy craft according to the needs of the moment, and you can\'t get
lucky and take them all out. (It does not, of course, offer the
mandatory gigantic spinal mount, nor a BB\'s station-keeping
capabilities). You wage war at range and are insulated from catastrophe
and try to keep your big expensive ships back out of the way. For the
desperate low-tech combatant, these are musts.

What do they look like? Because our low-tech fighters are... well... so
low-tech, and have to carry all of the toys that make them so effective,
they start at around 30 tons and go up to 150 or so. They employ a
binary drive system of HEPLAR and conventional CG powered by Fusion+,
giving you double-redundancy against crippling shots (within a gravity
well, anyway) and good fuel-efficiency within a gravity well (again,
only within a gravity well). There would also be a smattering of older
nuclear-powered interceptors propelled by fusion rockets (why are these
bloody things so bloody expensive?!?). Planetary interceptors would be
small, missile-armed, and have very limited burn time on all that bulky
fuel to conserve on displacement, so you could build enough of them to
make a difference -- we\'re talking Soviet-style air defence here, folks.
Burn out there as fast as you can, launch your spread of missiles, and
run back home to refuel and rearm.

Also, since experienced fighter jockeys are valuable and hardware
relatively cheap by comparison, each fighter will have an honest-to-God
ejection pod -- a very small subordinate craft with full life support
and limited burn time for a teeny little HEPLAR drive; just enough for
you to scoot back to your own side. You can also carry the electronics
and active sensors in the \'pod, thereby preserving the most expensive
portion of the hardware.

To compliment the swarms of fighters with the necessary firepower to
pierce a battleships\'s thick hide, however, you need a big spinal mount
- -- but without the rest of the battleship wrapped around it, and
preferably as fast as a fighter itself. Viola! the Fleet Self-Propelled
Gun, or FSPG. Ideally, it is a battlerider of not greater than a couple
of thousand tons displacement, consisting of a mammoth manuver
drive/power section and a crew pod hanging off the ass-end of the
biggest NPAW you can put out there, along with a few point-defense
systems, and not much else. Think of it as spaceborne field artillery.

Lessee, now... you can shoot at all those missiles coming in, or all
those fighters shooting at you, or the nasty FSPG\'s operating in
wolfpacks of two or three all beating up on the same target, or all the
little self-propelled laser batteries, or all the sensor drones that are
collecting the information necessary for everybody to shoot at you...
but ah... lessee.... even presuming equivelant tonnage in
technologically superior capital ships, this is starting to look like
kind of a dicey proposition. How many goddam targets can YOU shoot at?
The same principles hold true even if you are average stellar tech and
you are fighting the TL20+ bad guys from Babylon 5.

Even after you figure out the mysteries of the meson for yourself,
you\'re not liable to change your force structure overnight. It just
makes your fighters and all your assorted toys that much nastier. Your
100-ton missile bombers sprout meson guns, your interceptors can carry
half a dozen robot drones instead of a pair, your FSPG\'s come in
meson-flavored varieties, and the war goes on. A low-tech species that
clawed its way up the military ladder would probably look very much like
what I\'ve just described. The cult of the fighter jock would have been
thoroughly seared into their military culture. Barring catastrophic
setbacks, it\'d probably stay that way. Races at peace during their
stellar development would continue to build big bulky ships even after
improved technology made it possible to build them smaller.

I\'d like to see fleet actions where whole task forces can have their
ships become components in a single massive sensor array; I understand
the US Navy is working on just such a system, so this is clearly in the
extrapolative technology (not the bullshittium) realm. And a simple
minus based on tonnage to non-nuclear, non-meson damage rolls for large
ships would reflect their robust construction and superior damage
control capabilities. This is all necessary and desirable.

But don\'t be too quick to write off the fighter as a terribly useful
component on a well-balanced fleet (anybody ever try to build a "battle
carrier" -- a battlecruiser with the speed and subordinate armament of
its class, but converting the NPAW tunnel into a launch tube for oodles
of fighters and doing away with the spinal mount altogether?). And you
cannot deny that a low-tech dreadnaught (not necessarily less capable
than its High Stellar counterpart, but far bulkier and more expensive)
going up against a meson-equipped warship of ANY size is nothing but a
pathetic joke. You go the Luke Skywalker route or you die en masse,
entombed in a massive hull whose value as protection is suddenly
outweighed by its size as a target.

So long as supposedly sentient creatures settle their differences by
violence, wherever radical gaps in technology exist between bellicose
neighbors (look at 20th century Earth!) -- there is the fighter, your
only ally and salvation. Whoever would defend himself from supratech
aggression must put his money on these unassuming little manned
missiles.

Hey! Did the British do that too?  In the states they trained pidgeons to
guide glide bombs to their targets.  I think it was, the bahaviorist, BF
Skinner\'s project.  I don\'t know if the project went past lab testing, but
from what I\'ve heard it would have worked very well.  Well except for the

Anders, it doesn\'t *have* to be that way.  Thrusters *could* need a warm up
period, before they go online, or ramp up from 0 thrust to full thrust over
a period of time. This could be an interesting limitation to stick
thrusters with..powerful and don\'t need reaction mass, but expensive and
takes time to power up.

"Helm take us out of here, full thrust!"

"Sorry Captain, but the Chief reports the thrusters won\'t be up to power
for another 4 minutes."

"Damn it! Didn\'t I order her to keep them HOT?"

General NB Forrest was a country boy (actually a crafty self-promoter who
had gotten rich trading in anything, anybody would buy, including slaves).
He enlisted as a private in the southern forces and rose through the ranks
to Lt General by the end of American Civil War.  Ok, he paid for his
commission, but it was his merit that got him from Lt Coronel to General.
<g>

Forrest was protrayed by the press as a country rube, the "the barefoot
general." I\'d guess "Get there first-est with the most-est." was some
journalist\'s interpertation of what Forrest said. <G> OTOH, Forrest was
said to have played up his country-boy image so he might have said it that
way himself...with a wink and a grin.  

After the war, he lost his fortune during reconstruction, but soon made
another by...um, questionable means.  He was supposedly the first Grand
Wizard of the KKK, but quit when it\'s activities escalated from speeches
and cross burnings to shootings and house burnings...or so said my
Grandfather. <G>

    'body' => 'Continuing my reviews of all the T4 products, here\'s my take on the 
new Referee\'s Screen.

In short, if you liked the screen DGP put out for MegaTraveller (and 
I did), then you\'ll like this one.

Overall, I\'d give it a 3 out of a possible 5 if I had to rate it 
against the other products, but if you are the type of GM, like me, 
who uses a screen, then this is a good buy.

Speaking of "buy", the screen costs $12.95, and I got it at my local 
game store.  The fact that it was available locally came as a 
pleasant surprise to me, because when I first heard tell of the 
screen, I was under the understanding that it was only available 
through IG Internet ordering program.  

I don\'t like putting my credit card up on the net (I just haven\'t 
been convinced that it is safe yet), so I much prefer being able to 
buy it at my local store.

In fact, I told myself that if I had to get it over the net, then I 
wouldn\'t get it.  I didn\'t need it that much.

But, on to the review...

One of the best things that the screen has got going for it is that 
it is packed with info.  There\'s three seperate pieces to the 
screen--the screen itself, the adventure, and the cover to the whole 
package.


The Cover:

This is a thin piece of paper that wraps around the 
cardboard-like screen (the adventure is on regular papet, 
stapled, and inside the the screen). 

 When I opened the 
package, I was surprised to see that even the cover was used 
for game purposes too.  I sure didn\'t expect this because, on the 
outside, it looks like a throw-away cover.

On one side of this cover is the actual "cover" to the package.  It 
features one of the Foss pics that is in the T4 main book, and 
normally I would be dogging that because I don\'t like a lot of the 
Foss art (in a Traveller context).

But, good news...this is actually one of the Foss pics that I think 
is very Traveller.  As a matter of fact, if you have read the short 
story I wrote and posted here on the TML some months back called 
"Instant Replay", I can picture this pic as the scene where the 
escape pod blasts its way out of the OSIRIS asteroid mining base just 
before the reactor blows taking the whole asteroid with it.

Given this, and the fact that I really like this one Foss pic, it was 
a good choice for the cover of the Ref\'s screen.

The back "cover" of this sheet has your typical sales info tatalizing 
the reader to buy the product.  I have no problem with this, and this 
is something that you see on just about every game package from every 
RPG game company.  It\'s the stuff you read when you are deciding to 
buy it or not.

Inside the "cover" is where a treat lies.  As I 
said, I expected this sheet to serve a just a cover.  Marc should be 
commended for thinking of using this space for game stuff.

What you get on the inside of this cover is information for the 
adventure that comes with the game.  On one side, you get 8 of the 
new "NPC" cards.  6 of these have NPC info on them for the included 
adventure, but 2 of these are blank.  You can photocopy them if you 
want to use the card format for other NPC\'s in your game.

On the opposite side of these cards is a map and planet info for the 
adventure.  This is M0 player\'s information, and what that means is 
that the map and planet UPP\'s are incomplete;  you see a lot of 
blanks.

Normally, I\'d be dogging this too, because I don\'t like those 
incomplete maps that are being used in M0 supplements like First 
Survey.  I\'m a ref, and I want complete maps.  I can easily take a 
blank sector map and detail/limit the info I give to my players.

But, I\'m not dogging it here because, from looking at the adventure, 
having it this way is pertinent to the adventure.  A quick scan of 
the adventure reveals that the PC\'s are searching for something, and 
this type of limited info map is more appropriate here than it ever 
has been in the other M0 products.

Am I changing my mind about these limited info maps?  Heck, no!  It 
is just that I mind it less here than I do in some of the other M0 
products.



The Screen:

The screen itself is printed on a thick, card-board type stock and 
has four double-sided panels.  Although the screen is thick, it is 
not as thick (and durable) as I\'d like it to be.  I\'ve compared it to 
the old DGP screen, and it is about the same thickness as that one 
was.  On first glance, I\'d like the screen to be a little more 
sturdy--maybe as thick as the old D&d screens used to be, but upon 
examination of my DGP screen, it has held up pretty good over the 
years (and I\'ve had it since 1989 when it was first published).

Given this, I think the new T4 screen will hold up well if you take 
care of it, don\'t bend it, and don\'t get it wet.

The player\'s side of the screen has some basic, generic information, 
and on some of the four panels, this information is sparse.

On player panel #1, the skill list is printed.  Cluster and Cascade 
skills are listed in bold, and all of the Default skills are marked 
for easy reference.  The skills list is like the one in the main 
book, although a better job has been done in marking Cluster, 
Cascade, and Default skills.  At the end of the list, there is 
another table, like the one in Book 1, listing the Cascade skills for 
Aircraft, Blade Combat, and Gun Combat skill groupings.

Also on this panel are three tables for computers.  You get the 
Computer Ratings table, the Program Difficulties table, and the 
Processing Times table.

Below that is a table that I consider a real treat because I haven\'t 
seen it listed in any of the other T4 products yet, and I was 
wondering when they were going to get around to including it 
somewhere.

What I\'m talking about is the Master Range table.  The one in Book 1, 
for combat, ends with Very Long.  On this master table, this is only 
one-third the way down the table.

This table starts with Contact range at 0 meters and ends with Sector 
range at 50 Pc.

Panel #2 sports an example of the UPP for characters.  I\'ve been 
playing Traveller for some 14 years now, and I still have to look up 
which digit of the UPP is End.  I\'m glad this is here for easy 
reference.

There\'s also three tables here.  One has the one-line definitions of 
the Primary Characteristics (Str, Dex, etc.).  Another is a table of 
Hexadecimal Numbers, and I\'m glad this is here.  When we start 
getting into the letters, I always have to start counting fingers.  
What did "E" stand for again?  (looking at the table) Oh yeah, it\'s 
14.

The third table is the Noble Ranks table giving the letter codes and 
Rank/Title for each code.  It starts with Soc of B (Knight) and ends 
with Soc of H (Emperor).

Moving along to player panel #3, we get the UWP explanation.  As has 
already been mentioned here on the TML, this also includes the new 
additions to the UWP that we are supposed to be learning about in an 
upcoming T4 product.  I\'m referring to the Resources, Labor, 
Infrastructure, and Culture codes in the UWP, and I\'m glad Marc put 
these in for completeness sake.

Looking back at my old DGP screen, I noticed the section that I 
referred to most was the UWP example.  I never can remember if 
Population goes before Government or what the 5th digit in the UWP 
referrs to.

I am really glad the UWP example was included on the T4 screen, but I 
do have a big critisim here.  The old DGP screen listed tables that 
told you what all the codes meant.  For example, what\'s a Government 
code B mean?  Looking at my DGP screen, I can easily see that this 
means the planet is ruled by a Non-Charismatic Leader.

I\'m sorry to say that the T4 screen does not include this.  You are 
told what each digit of the UWP means, but you\'ll have to pull out 
Book 1 to look up the codes.  In my book, this is a big mistake on 
the screen.

The last player panel has two large tables.  One is the weapon\'s list 
from Book 1, and it includes weapon name, TL, Range, Shots, Mass, 
Reloads, and Cost columns.

On the bottom half of the panel is the Equipment table from Book 1 
listing item name, TL, Mass, and Cost.

I\'m so-so about these tables.  They are good for quick reference, but 
I\'m running my campaign in the 1100\'s so I doubt I\'ll use these 
tables very often.  For an M0 campaign, it\'s probably more 
appropriate, but you are still only getting the basic weapons and 
equipment from Book 1--not a combined list that details all the T4 
equipment in the CSC and the weapons that are in the EA.

Is that a negative?  Well, no, not really, but I\'d be much more 
excited and impressed with the screen if the CSC and EA items were 
listed.

Now let\'s look at the ref\'s side of the screen.  All four of these 
panels have a bunch of info on them--much more than the player side 
does.

Ref panel #1 has the Encounter Range table,  the Encounter Range 
Terrain Modifiers table, and the Encounter Avoidance rule.  The 
Surprise DMs table is also printed there, and the Ground Combat 
Procedure table is below that.

You also get Vehicle Hit Location table.

The Combat Range to hit table is listed, but there is a typo on it so 
that all of the categories list only "D6".  This is easy enough to 
fix because you can take a pen or a thin black marker and write in 
the correct dice code, but it is evident that IG is carrying on its 
poor trend of typos in their products.

Also on this panel is the never before published official new task 
system.  I think that this is both good and bad.  It\'s good because 
they are keeping the screen up to date with the rules in T4--I\'d 
really be dogging the screen if it had the old task system (the 
current one from Book 1) and they changed it in the new revised 
edition of T4.  So, I like the fact that the screen will be 
compatible with the revised editon of T4 and does not have the old 
info (which is the current info we are using now).

My gripe is really not with the screen but with Marc and IG.  They 
are keeping the attribute + skill target number calculation, which I 
think should be changed to give more creedence to having a skill.  I 
think that attributes play a big part in task success, but I also 
think that skills play a much bigger roll in that success than the 
current target number calcuation affords.

My other gripe is that they are continuing to use the half die.  So 
many people dislike using the D3, so if we are "fixing" T4, why don\'t 
we do it right and fix this too?  Why are we continuing to use 
something so many people dislike?  I proved that the D3 are not 
necessary with the KBv2.0 task system.  Whole die can be used to 
obtain good percentages of success.  Instead, the "new" T4 task 
system is using the half die--albeit it is only attached to one 
category, Difficult, but that category is the one most often used in 
a game.

On top of this, the screen has another typo.  The Difficult category 
is listed with a dice code of "2+D".  It should read "2.5D", and 
you\'ll have to pencil this in on your screen.

There\'s a good thing about the new task system though.  Marc is 
bringing back the Universal Task Format used in MegaTraveller.  
One-half of this panel is devoted to the new task format.  Listed is 
the Task Phrase, Task Statement, and Task Comments.  There\'s a 
paragraph on Task Resolution and information of performing Default 
Skill Tasks, Cooperative Tasks, Opposed Tasks, Uncertain Tasks, 
Hasty Tasks, and Cautious Tasks.

But with that, we have a bad thing too.  Spectacular Success and 
Failure are listed.  SF is now considered to occur anytime THREE 
sixes are rolled.

I\'ve got a major problem with this.  Here\'s the new Task Difficulty 
table:

			Easy					(automatic)
			Easy (with Default skill)		1D
			Average					2D
			Difficult					2.5D
			Formidable				3D
			Staggering				4D
			Impossible				5D

Consulting this table, you can only have a SF on Formidable tasks or 
greater!  SF is not possible on Easy, Average, or even Difficult 
tasks!

Big, big, big problem there.  Like I said, the problem is not with 
the screen, it\'s this idiotic new "improved" task system that they 
are going to.

LISTEN UP PEOPLE!  DON\'T USE THIS CRAPPY SYSTEM--USE KBv2.0.

And here\'s another problem.  SS is now when you roll three ones.  
Well, first off, like SF, you can only get SS on Difficult or higher 
difficulties, but that\'s not the major problem here.  When rollling 
three ones, the more dice you throw, the easier it is to roll those 
three ones.

What does that mean?  It means that the chance of rolling SS GOES UP 
the harder the task is!

Boy, oh boy, oh boy.  Why does IG insist on putting out his crap?  
T4 has the potential of being one of the best RPGs every produced, 
but IG keeps on screwing things up with rules like these.

The reason I\'m coming down so hard on IG is that this isn\'t their 
first try at it.  This system is supposed to fix the problems in Book 
1 now, and yet--here it is their second try at it--they still come up 
with a flawed system.

KBv2.0--that\'s the best thing going right now.

OK, let\'s move on to ref panel #2.  You get the Patron Encounters, 
the Random Encounters, and the Rumors tables from Book 1.  Below that 
is a new Reaction table.  This one is more like the MT model, and 
there is another table that introduces Certainty Levels to T4.

Cool.  I like that.

Ref panel #3.  There\'s the Passenger\'s table, the Cargo table, the 
Ship Revenues table, the Brokers table, the Cost of Goods table, the 
Actual Value table, and the Market Price table.

In the center of all of these merchant tables, they\'ve listed the 
Trade and Commerce Checklist.

A good job was done on this panel.  This is useful info that I can 
see referring to during an adventure.

Finally, we get to ref panel #4.  There\'s the space combat Sequence 
of Play table, the Combat Damage (space combat) table with an 
explanation of results, the Sensor Locks and Detection table, the 
Sensor Rating table, the Weapon Fire (to hit) table, and the 
Sandcasters table.

This is great and well if you like the space combat system in Book 1, 
but I think that they did a sorry job on that space combat system.  
It\'s hard for me to even follow what they\'ve done.  In my games, I 
use the old Mayday rules, and I encourage you to use that or the old 
CT basic system or the High Guard system (you could even spend some 
time converting TNE\'s Brilliant Lances to T4).  All of these systems 
are much better than the poorly thought out High-Guard wannabe system 
that is contained in Book 1.

And, of course, there\'s another typo here.  On the Weapon Fire table 
that is used to see what the difficulty level is for ship when making 
a to hit throw, the attack ratings listed referr to the old Book 1 
task system.  For instance, targets at Long range require a 
Staggering roll, and it is listed here that Staggering is 3.5D when 
the new system (see above) states that Staggering rolls are done with 
4D.  This is easy to fix, though.  You just pencil in the correct 
dice code and scratch out what is printed.  It\'s just a shame that 
you have to do that.



The Adventure.

The adventure included with the screen look decent.  Although I\'ve 
never seen it before, I\'ve heard others here on the TML say that 
Memory Alpha has been around for a long time.  Marc has gone in and 
retuned the adventure for the M0 milieu and set it in the Core 
sector.  It was probably set in the Spinward Marches before, but I\'m 
not sure about this since it is the first time I\'ve seen it.  

The actual adventure comes in a stapled 8 page pamphlet written in 
the tradition of the old GDW Adventure and Double Adventure books.

Although I like the old GDW adventures, I always had a gripe that 
they were not detailed enough.  I grew up on D&D, and I always liked 
having the whole adventure planned out for me.  The GDW adventures 
always seemed like they were more adventure ideas rather than full 
blown detailed adventures, and I always hated the fact that they 
alwasy required a lot of GM prep work.  I was ecstatic when DGP 
changed this and came along with there "nugget & flow chart" style of 
adventures.

Memory Alpha is no different than these early CT adventures, but I\'m 
glad it was included in the package.  I also like the fact that work 
was done on this adventure to bring it in to M0.  Although I\'m 
playing in the 1100\'s, this shows me that they just didn\'t slap an 
old adventure into the game.



Summary.

Basically, I like the screen.  I\'ve got some grips, but some of those 
are directed towards the choices that Marc and IG have made about the 
new game rules and not at the screen itself.  And, I\'ll say it again, 
they really need to put some more thought into that new T4 task "fix" 
before it comes out in the revised edition of Traveller.  It\'s really 
not a fix.  It\'s just new problems.

Also, I\'m unhappy about the code tables for the UWP not being 
included on the screen.  I used this a lot on my DGP screen, so I 
guess that I\'ll just have to keep using my DGP screen along with this 
new T4 one.

They left out the animal attack rules.  I was hoping this would be on 
the screen as well.  Since these were forgotten in the main book, I 
was anxious to see how they were going to handle that given the new 
task system, but even without this, the animal attack rules are 
something that I know I would have referred to on the screen if it 
were there.  That\'s another negative to the screen.

Other than that, and the things that I have mentioned above, I think 
that IG has continued the trend of overpricing their products.  This 
thing is 13 bucks, which is not that bad given all that you get, but 
I remember that my old DGP screen seemed a better value.  With that, 
you actually got two screens, although they were only three panel, 
an adventure about the size of Memory Alpha, and some of those 
great old equipment sheets that DGP used to produce.  

I don\'t feel too bad about the value of the T4 screen, it\'s just that 
I felt better about the DGP screen when I bought it for MT.

And that\'s the way I see it.

Thats a good point bill.  The flip side to the current paradigm of initial
planes (wwwi/wwii) are simple --> modern planes (complex)  could continue
in the 50 centuries ahead by adding --> Imperial fighter (simple).

Honestly, what is there to do in a future fighter?  The pilot says i want
to get there and off he goes, the pilot cant handle dodging and split
second manuevring, especially when were talking about speed of light
weapons, so the computer will do that.  A pilot cant handle really high G
acceleration, so automation (future hydrolics?) will do that also.

The only point i wish to make is that the training issue is really vague.
A refere could say that 50th century fighters are even more complex or
more simple to handle then current day fighters.  Theres no evidence
either way (more or less complex to fly) so training may not be an issue.






An army raised without proper regard
to the choice of its recruits was
never made good by length of time.

If your FCS is built by man it can be as stupid as man is.<G> How could the

Any single missile will require extraordinary conditions to successfully
get to any decently equipped target, but how many could the your ship
render inoperative/destroyed before warheads were deployed? All FCS\'s will
have an overload point and/or conditions, Like early version of CIWS would
not engage targets that were in certain parallel approach vectors.

At an armor value of CSC 64 or USP 12, what would the stats be for PD or
any weapon to engage of range before warhead deployment?

Hmmm.. I do not recall ever hearing that from him, just call me "Doubting

the two systems will have to mesh.

Yes I have seen those posts but they IMO seem to deal in "ideal" firing
situations, not what would be routinely found in combat. If the FCS will
only be as accurate as the data supplied by sensors.

What is current stand figuring agility in the NAH/GDW-Beta? As of today the
GDW-Beta archives are not every current. 

Also Dave are you aware that the "Admiralty" part of your web site has lots
of missing links?

People tend to do analogies with bodern day stuff like fighterplane engines

you flip a switch and you get full thrust right away.<<<<

Incorrect.  It is the rate of change of the angular momentum.  IOW, its how
fast you can change direction.  For example - Bank and pull hard and you
start turning, pull harder and you turn faster but pull more G\'s.  The
maximum G load isn\'t as important here as the ability of the airframe to turn
quickly (as long as you don\'t exceed the capacity and rip the wings off ;->).
 A T-37 has a max G rating of a little over 5 but has one of the highest G
onset rates in the world. It ain\'t fast  but it can really turn quick.   This
is what I call agility.

Changing direction quickly is a very big part of dogfighting (but not
everything).  I will grant you that against a Capital Ship a fighter doesn\'t
have a chance but against smaller ships it will be an effective weapon and
being able to outmaneuver your opponent has got to be some margin for help.
 You tell me how to employ Agility to a large spaceship.  It will be more
than the leaning they did on the old Star Trek.  ;-)

 I do NOT think that everyday users will interface with VR systems. They
will interface with people like artificial constructs that you talk to more
or less like an aide or a secretary but with broad and deep expertise. The
VR style computers is a gaming thing or from the highly implausible Gibson
books (good read though). We have consumer priced VR stuff today but nobody
is making accounting packages, wordprocessors, data analysis siftware for
VR. VR is good for games and perhaps porn. BTW pornographic VR software
should be a big seller for starship crews to while away those boring weeks
in hyperspace.

Because it is based on SF literature that predates cyberpunk by a decade or
two depending on wether you\'ve read "Dra Adder" or not. I like the absence
of cyberpunk in Traveller as cyberpunk seems to have so little workable
ideas and so much cliche\'. TNE however had the feel of cyberpunk so there
you could insert cybernetic chainsaw arms and general nihilistic feel.

For simplicity a boat with a given mass thus a given displacement volume
the longer the waterline the smaller the frontal area and thus less drag
keeping draft fixed. This is not entirely true but good enough to account
for larger vessels generally go faster in water.

Agree, I\'m only trying to enlighten people as to why people seem to take

What exactly good has IG done except the T-shirts and mousepads?
All there products are contradicory buggy and only improving compared to
their earlier works. Try comparing any IG products to lets say Steve
Jackson games. I stopped buying their stuff after reading rave reviews of
CSC and finding it to be mostly crappy, bad art but with a few interesting
tidbits ie the best so far.

Sorry about being so bad tempered but I haven\'t had my coffee yet.

Neutrino detectors need to be large otherwise there wouldn\'t be any other
sensors as they are so advantageous: You can look through planets and keep
your sensors under armor. Also the detection capability increases with
volume rather than area.

If future advances make \'em easier then the designers will cram in more
functions for the pilot to do. Fighter pilots will drive around some pretty
expensive hardware so making them utilize it as much as possible will be
high priority.

You assume that they will be easier and give examples from WWII, I think
they\'ll get harder by giving the entire history of flight as a trend. Then
you say that we do not know what the future will be which I agree to.
Either we say we do not know or they\'ll get harder. If you decide your
future will have simple to use ships OK but my argument was simply that the
WWII example was invalid.

Why thank you. Like you I do believe fighters have a place in Traveller.
I don\'t see them as the dogfighting versions beloved of SF movies, more
as the space equivilant of Fast Attack Craft. The carrier as I see it
is not carring F/A-18\'s, but something closer to a Osa or Tarantil <sp>

They still need sensors, even with smart missiles they have to know which
direction to point them :*).

There\'s a maxim with artillery, it goes "Don\'t tap it, thump it". Orbiting
battleships would be *very* good at thumping things. However as you point
out there are problems with ortillery (orbital artillery). The atmosphere
makes targeting difficult; assuming that most ortillery will be missile
fire (or more likely smart deadfall) there\'s a time delay; it relies on
having your big ships in orbit where they are vulunerable to planetry based
fire; its not as flexible as direct support; and probably most important, it
doesn\'t have the same morale effect. There\'s something very comforting for
the troops on the ground to be able to physically see their support. It
might be nice to see a concentration of enemy troops or a bunker disappear
from orbital fire, but the troops would most likely prefer to see a squadron
of fighters roar overhead. It just makes them feel safer, regardless of the
reality of the situation.

I\'d agree here. Missiles regardless of launching platform would be "smart"
missiles. They might be terminal guidance (they get close, activate their
own sensors and locate and lock on), Radiation Homing (rely on active
emissions of the target, the classic ARM missile, good at taking out your
enemies active sensors), or semi-active homing (rely on illumination of the
target by another source). Fighters could use either terminal guidance or
radiation homing. The fighter still needs to have some sensors (you have
to know roughly where the target is). They\'d have to be passive (better
range and less likely to assist the enemy targeting you). This makes a
fighter a missile launch rack. Esentially increasing the survivability
of your armarment by spreading it out over a larger area and making the
launchers individually mobile. A very rough analogy might be an artillery
battery in a dispersed battery site (heavy emphasis on the rough analogy).
The question here is does the increase in survivablity make up for the
increased cost (both in Cr and tonnage) of the figther support facilities?

Here\'s an interesting thought. If Thrust plates emit a range of unusual
particles (SSDS), why not build a missile with a guidance system which
homes in on them? The traveller equivilent of a Sidewinder. If you switch
off your thrusters you become a sitting duck. This gives the counter
measure of thruster flares.

Sorry, I hadn\'t been following the full thread. Any admiral who would
commit any capital ship without support deserves to be cashiered.

As an aside, the Japanese at the end of the war did have very big problems
with finding pilots. They had started the war with the best pilots in the
world, but had an inadequate training system and couldn\'t replace their
losses. They went to great lengths to avoid using pilots in kamakazi attacks
(generally unsuccesfully I might add). The crews of the kamakazi aircraft
weren\'t pilots, they were a missile guidance system; trained in bulk to
take off, fly a very basic course and crash (they were not trained to land),
They were trained on the ground, many of them never took off in an aircraft
before their actual mission.
Incidently the during the 2nd WW the British developed a very effective
system of missile guidance based around trained pidgens, capable of taking
individual bridge supports over 1,000km. It was never deployed. Apparently
the British high command was heavy in bird fanciers, and as the pidgen died,
they considered it to be just not good form. The worlds first (and only) PGM
(Pidgen Guided Munition). Just another bit of mindless trivia, but I\'m sure
an enterprising traveller umpire could work that one in somewhere :*).

Its not the problem of finding new pilots, its the problem of training them.
At least two years, which goes a good way to negating the speed of
construction advantage. Plus you have to devote considerable resources to
maintaining a training establishment, pilots are training intensive.

An interesting idea. It comes down to do the advantages of the fighters
(increased survivability of your missile batteries and increased flexibility
of role for the missile batteries) make up for the cost of the fighter
support facilities? Under HG I think it would, I\'m not sure about FFS or T4.

As to operations around a planet, its a whole different coffee pot of
herrings. Here the fighter does make sense. The ranges will be much closer,
the big ship is deprived of it\'s range advantage, the fighter can hide by
skooting down into the atmoshpere. Here you need a carrier with your own
fighters to deal with the planetry based fighters. Even a 2000Td destroyer
is going to have to think very careful about following fighters down into an
atmosphere.

>>Oh and BTW the last classic battleship dual was in the Pacific in 1944.

Guadalcanal. But no it was Surigao Strait. Fuso and Yamashiro against
Tennesse, West Virginia, Maryland and Mississippi; 24-25 Oct 1944. The
Japanese lost.

Exactly, the fighters don\'t "kill" the ship, but weaken it so another big
ship can easily. But in this role the fighters would have to stick close
to your own big ships for protection. Here the analogy is torpedo boats,
they hide behind your battle line and dash out and launch a stand off
attack. Think of the classic torpeodo charge. They don\'t even have to
actually inflict any real damage on the enemy, just launch enough missiles
to occupy them for a bit, giving your big ships a tactical advantage.
There are certain systems which just have to on or near the surface. Things
like sensors, drive exhausts, weapons etc (not incidentaly the bridge, the
modern CIC is put very deep in the ship); and these will be vulunerable and
the loss of them will really hurt.

I\'m not really qualified to comment. I\'d see the average battleship as
having 4 or 5g acceleration, so the fighter would have a slight edge, just
enough to act as a torpedo boat. However I am not that familiar with either
T4 design or FFS to make a good judgement. I still use HG. I\'m not that
interested in indepth ship designs, I regard it as a distraction from role
playing (No value judgement, just what I personally prefer).

As someone has pointed out, in M:0 this may not be true, ships might not
have a good secondary anti-fighter armarment. However as soon as fighters
appear, they will get one PDQ.

>Also, if i remember corecctly the High Guard rules had a limit on the

As I understand it, no its not. The limit now is volume and surface area.
But then again, I still use HG. It produces ships I regard as good enough
and allows me to conentrate on what I prefer (roleplaying). I\'ve yet to
see any PC\'s in a ship which can slug it out with even a 2000Td escort,
so as long as the rules reflect that, I\'m happy :*). Any rule system that
gives the PC\'s a chance of taking out a 100,000Td battleship is fundimentally
broken IMHO (not that any traveller system does as far as I\'m aware).

And there is where your argument falls apart. Check out the signal

No. It\'s the one that can accelerate more rapidly. It\'s *speed* depends
on how *long* it can accelerate. "Faster" is not the right term for
this, because it brings in ideas that are flat out *wrong*. "Higher
performance" is a more reasonable term.

Easy. The guy in the fighter is picked for a higher g tolerance. The
guy in the BB can\'t boost above the *lowest* g tolerance in the crew
unless he\'s willing to sacrifice that crew member (and it won\'t always
be certain *which* crew members he\'ll be injuring or killing at a given
acceleration).

That too.

> What do you mean?

A combo of the fact that one a big ship you tend to need the crew to be
able to move around, and the "ship is limited to the *lowest*
g-tolerance on board" and the "fighter pilots are picked for high
g-tolerance" does it quite nicely.

At "typical" impact velocities in Traveller, it\'ll do a lot more than
scuff the paint!

At 3 km/sec it\'s equivalent to setting off a chunk of TNT the same
weight. At 6 km/sec it\'s *4* times as powerful. At 9 km/sec it\'s 9
times as powerful. At 12 km/sec it\'s 16 times....

But we are more likely talking about something like 300 km/sec. That
gives 100^2 or 10,000 times as powerful. If a 7.62 round masses what I
think it does, we are talking about a quarter *ton* of TNT.

Kinetic kill would rule if we could only find a way to aim them where
the ship will be when they get there!

Well, don\'t forget that "weeks" of acceleration aren\'t at all likely.
Any trip that\'d take a week of accel/decel (ie 3.5 days of each) is
going to be covered by a microjump instead.

Also 3.5 days of accel at 6 g takes you 18+ AU. with the additional 3.5
days of decel that gives 35+ AU total. That\'s out past Neptune!

But "high vector" *attacks* are possible. For example, I could fire
rounds from a (big) mass driver at where you\'d be. Sure it\'d take a lot
of rounds to cover the area you might be in by the time they get there.
On the other hand, at those speeds even a BB will make you toast! (max
speed during that 35+ AU trip is 18,144 km/s. That\'s 6% of c!)

The problem isn\'t range. It\'s delta-v. The missiles have an infinite
range, but they have a *very* restricted capability to change course.
Between light speed lag, and evasive measures there is a maximum range
at which you can fire the missile and still have any hope of it coming
near the target.

You fire a missile at where you *think* the target will be when the
missile gets there. If the target is "nearby" when the missile gets
into range of the *missile\'s* sensors, then it can try to correct its
course to intercept. But the greater the range you fire from, the more
time the target has to manuever, and the less chance that the missile
will have the fuel for an intercept.

The "limiting case" for missiles is the inert projectile with no
maneuvering capability. It can only hit if the target is where it was
aimed for when it gets there. Once a missile has used up its manuever
capability, it\'s an inert projectile, and worthless if it is far enough
away for a course change to get the target out of its path.

But that\'s the point. You *can\'t* mask it. Not in space. The background
is dead "black". The ship is glowing "white". And any "mask" *near* the
ship will absorb the heat it is supposed to be blocking, which then
makes *it* start glowing.

My opinions remain the same, as they were based on physics, not the rules!

Without g-comp, a fighter can go faster simply because the only limit
is what the pilot can take. Big ships are limited to what the weakest
crew member can take.

With limited g-comp, the results are the same. With unlimited g-comp
(or at least g-comp that can handle as much as the drive can put out)
this advantage disappears.

On the other hand, small vessels getting near large *military* ships
are likely to fry (same reasons given here). Some sort of "force shield
might help, but then the big ship would be even *harder* to hurt with
the small ship\'s weapons.

Non miltary vessels are toast for anything armed. Armed merchants are
toast to anything thatis better armed, or that get the drop on them. 

So as I said in the discussion, fighter do scouting, harass shipping,
and try not to be noticed by big ships.

Asteroid belts don\'t look much like what you see in the movies or tv.
It\'ll be highly unusual to be able to see one asteriod when you are on
another. Even in "dense" sections, it\'ll be thousands of km between
bodies.

Slight problem. What are you using for cable on that "harpoon"? You\'d
need unobtanium to keep it from snapping. You\'ll have hundreds of tons
of stress on it. And that will snap any reasonable sized cable like a
thread. All it take is one burst from the main drive and the cable is
trying to (in effect) support the mass of the ship against the drive\'s
g rating. And if there was any slack, it\'s as if the ship *dropped*
that far under that many g. So when the slack runs out, the cable may
snap. The anchor point may tear loose or the grapple will tear loose.
Probably the last.

But fighters can\'t do much in the way of "damage control" anyway.
Consider a ship and a PT boat. If the ship takes significant damage, it
has damage control to fix it while underway. If a PT boat takes an
equivalent amount of damage it\'s either going to have to limp along, or
it\'s dead in the water (or just plain dead).

The real trick is that even *with* acceleration couches, g-tanks, and
what have you, there\'s still an *individual variance in how many gees
you can handle. You pick fighter pilots from the top 5%? 1%? The folks
on larger ships *can\'t* be selected that way except to for a minimum
standard. You need too mant different sorts of skills and training. 

So the fighter pilot is *inherently* more capable of handling high
g-loads or he wouldn\'t *be* a fighter pilot.

But not as many as the fighter can! And the bigger the crew the *lower*
the limit will be. The max accel of a ship is limited to what the
*weakest* person aboard can handle. 

Remember, since we are talking about extended duration on this, that
means that you aren\'t just making the folks with lower g tolerances
uncomfortable, or even unconcious. You are *injuring*, and likely
*killing* them. Since you don\'t carry *that* many spare crew for any
given position, you wind up losing people you *need*.

I predict that except in dire emergency, most large vessels *won\'t*
overrun the g-comps by more than a g, if that. They probably would
never be *designed* to do so, because of the risks to the crew.

They also say it can be as late as 200 hours, which is just as hard to
get from the formula. :-)

They also say 168 +/- 10% elsewhere! (I\'d do that as 168 * ((2d-7)*.2))

So what\'s the normal jump prep time? 

Also, while there seem to be lots of references to jump *duration*,
there\'s nothing about *spatial* accuracy! That is, Just how close can I
come to a selected exit point?

This is very important for fleet manuevers too!

I know. That\'s what my *second* edition books (from "Deluxe Traveller")

It doesn\'t *have to be "lateral". For example, the pilot can get a 6g
change simply by *cutting* the drive if he was boosting at 6g when you
watched. :-)

Or if you go with the "figure for coasting", then he gets a 6g boost by
firing full throttle. And remember, even if he is firing the main drive
while turning, he is taking the 6 g on his *back*, and only the
steering jet thrust in some other direction. So "taking" the gees isn\'t
a problem.

Since the g load is on his back, there\'s no likely design where
it\'s a factor worth worrying about. Even 9g with no compensator is only
an annoyance (for a "typical pilot" not for me or thee). So it comes
down to acceleration and light lag (since we are assuming lasers).

Surgery was discovered at about TL0. Things like trephination existed.
The trick is, flint tools are essentially sterile if you use them right
after they are chipped (which is what you\'d do because you want your
*sharpest* tools for something important). And hunter/gatherer
populations have very little disease running around loose. So your
chances of survival of even something this extreme is pretty good.

Once you get settled populations, there are more people to harbor
disease, and add in metal tools, and things rapidly get worse.

Easy. I can speak from experience here. The university *won\'t have* all
the info. Most *technology* (as opposed to science) tends to involve
trade secrets. For example, any chemistry class will tell you the
melting point of silicon. And if you go to work for a company that
produces hyperpure silicon for semiconductor use, and work in the right
department, you\'ll learn that the figure in the books is *wrong*. The
correct figure is a trade secret!

The university will have the *principles* things are based on, but the
details of making them work is another matter. Also, the details and
even some of the principles for older tech levels tend to get lost. So
they\'d have to re-invent a lot of the intermediate technology. 

They also had more immediate problems, like trying to *survive* with
the high tech gone. Hit all of earth with a good mag pulse *now* and
we\'d lose most cities because there\'d be no way to feed them. And the
farmers couldn\'t harvest or transport food without tractors and trucks.

And even in the US we are *lucky* in that we have people who can
*remember* how to do it without the machinery. For the Darrians it\'d be
like us *having* to learn how to make stone tools to survive. Sure, a
few people know how, and others know it is *possible*. But not enough
to save more than a tiny fraction of the population.

> I can\'t come up with any scenario that allows a university to survive
> yet destroys the knowledge it contains. Can you?

Like I said, the trick is that universities *don\'t* contain state of
the art tech knowledge.

Craig, I think you\'ve done the list (and hopefully the *game*) a great
service with this post.

With this, all we need to figure sensor stuff (other than range) is:

Passive sensors:

1. the target\'s "emission profile". That\'s the radiated power in each
   sensor "band" (that is in the range of wavelengths a given sensor is
   good for).
2. the background\'s "emission profile".
3. the sensor\'s sensitivity (minimum signal it can detect, in dB)

Note that a ship *can* be detected if it is enough *below* the
background in a given band. But that *may* require a fourth parameter
(selectivity?).

Active Sensors:

1. the target\'s "reflection profile" (ie albedo in each band)
2. The background\'s emission profile.
3. The sensor\'s sensitivity.
4. The sensor\'s power.
5. the sensor\'s "focus" (ie the narrowness of the beam or lack thereof)

This looks to me like it could be handled simply by having the sensor
data (sensitivity for passive sensors, sensitivity, power, and focus
for active) as part of the sensor info you record, the ship\'s emmision
profile as part of the ship data, and the "backrground" emission\'s as
part of the system data.

For *design* rules, sensitivity in each band should cost more according
to some reasonable progression. And in some bands, it\'ll require bigger
antennas. There should also be a max limit at each TL, and an
*absolute* limit (one photon = ???? dB).

Likewise, power takes size and money. "Focus" takes money, I don\'t know
if it affects size much.

Emmission control should again vary by tech level, but I think that the
rule should be that you can\'t reduce your total emitted power, only
change the band and to some extent the direction. And you can\'t change
EM emissions into gravitic or neutrino emissions.

This fits the real world. Black paint and radar absorbent material just
take the optical and radar emissions and turn them into heat....

Oh yeah, I think communication ranges should use the same rules!

So the bands would be something like this:

Gravitic: Mass detectors, CG detectors, Thruster plate detectors (I\'m
	allowing for the likely idea that you can distinguish between
	these three things, but they are all the same basis stuff
	"gravity-like" radiation)
Neutrino: neutrino sensors
Particle radiation: geiger counters, etc. Mostly useful for detecting
	solar flates of particle beam "near misses".
EM radiation: This should be broken down into individual bands.
	1. long wave (any radio that will pentrate water/gas giant
		atmosphere to reasonable depths)
	2. medium wave (any radio that will pentrate a planetary ionisphere)
	3. short wave (anything up to a few cm wavelength)
	4. radar (cm to mm wavelength)
	5. IR (do we need sub-bands?)
	6. Optical
	7. UV 
	8. X-ray/gamma ray

This does sound like the device I saw mentioned. Apparently it was evaluated

I was struck by the simplicity of the system. I found it amongst a book on
weird military ideas that never made it. There were some real jems in it:
The french idea in 1st WW to use falcons to intercept messenger pigeons, the
Brazilian wire guided torpedo of 1910 (it involved a flag and two spools of
piano wire), the British idea of dealing with submarines by using swimmers
with hammers to smash in their periscopes, or trained seagulls to defecate
on them (I kid you not!), the Austrian steam tank of the 1880\'s (abandoned
because it frightened the Emperors horse). It would appear that the British
came with or seriously looked at more of these weird ideas than anybody
else, having a seemingly endless supply of eccentric backroom boffins and
equally eccentric military commanders willing to give ideas a go. How does
this relate to traveller? Not much really other than a vague comment that
the in amongst all the weird and wonderful ideas where some good ones and
that the eccentric British also came up with more of these too.

Interesting but I\'ve check yesterday where all those stars where in the
map. What do we do with those data. All the DGP stellar data are wrong. Do
we change thoses. There is also two stars which are in an empty Hex. Do we
have to move or  create a world in this Hex??

Suggestions?

This is already used is some cases. I\'ve worked on the design and
installation of such a device. We had to connect two building across a
road. We should have dig through the street (very expensive, needs lots of
licenses) or put small IR lasers on the roof. Very cheap indeed. The only
phisycal trouble is birds cutting the link :-). The solution : Use a high
power laser. If a bird cross the beam, it would be cut in half, so the link
wouldn\'t be stopped (joke)

IMO, in future, those kind of communication (focused ones) would be used a
lot. The trouble with radio waves is that the bandwidth is not extensive.
There is a limit. Assuming that the data traffic would explode, radio
broadcasting would only be used for Point-Multipoint transmission (TV,
Radio, ...).=20

You cannot increase the rate in a fixed bandwidth to quite infinte nor you
can increase the number of channels in the same bandwidth to infinite. With
focused communications (masers, lasers, or more simply cable wires...) you
just have to increase the number of emmiting devices or cables.=20


Here is my point of view on the communications

* Inside rooms : IR LED or lasers because of the comfort of using and the
very cheap price

* Inside buildings : Fiber optical networks between computers and orther
automated devices. They are easy to install during the building. Depends
largely on the complexity and the needed bandwidth.

* Static small range : The use of lasers would be very popular. Any one
could intall such device for a static range (easy aiming). Cost : very low

* Static long range : For town to town communications. Generaly centralized
on several communications points owned by companies or governments. Use of
Maser and Lasers. For more than 50% watered worlds, the use of Fiber
optical cables should be the best choice. Ora maybe low orbits satellites
with contragrav to maintain stationnary position above oceans.

* Mobile personnal : use of radio waves (as for Mobile phones). Cheap to
install, limited bandwith. Solution : Cells. Intracell communication =3D
radio waves, Intercell communication =3D previous case. As the population
increase the cell\'s size reduce to "gain" in bandwith. If heavy
communication in needed, Cells can be 10m large. In very low populated
area, cells can be handles by low orbits satelites which should be cheap
from TL12. Same system as Iridium network

* Mobile long range : As for starships. Maser of laser commo. Quite
expensive bexcause it has to be connected to a sensor to follow the moving
body. Radio waves for emergency and broadcasts communications.

* One way communications : Regular satellites. BTW, this type of
communications would certainlmy disapear because of the increase on
interactivity of programs. So the communcations systems would have to
handle both ways of  communications and have to be very delay sensitive.
Geosationnary satelits would certainly be useless for this type of
communication because of the delay. They would be replaced by low orbit
satellites with or without contragrav, or even better grounded networks


Now, Here is my point of view on the look for pre-collapse era

* Virtual reality : mainly 3D and for entertainement. But very present in
family groups. There would be virtual bars to meet other people (Imagine a
Traveller virtual lounge where we could met each other and have real
discussion instead of typing on this ~#*$^@=A7 keyboard). This would make
communications more user friendly.

* Professionnal computers. Virtual Reality or not, that is the question.
Take a look of the use of internet: Everyone want to have Internet at home,
and then at work. But is it productive to have Internet? I would say NOT AT
ALL. Ok, you can easily get informations but you loose much time to search
those data, and to walk around some web sites. Many companies don\'t want to
have Internet because it reduces the productivity of its staff. Intranet :
yes, Internet : no (yes if controled).
So VR? I disagree with Anders Backman :
> We have consumer priced VR stuff today but nobody
> is making accounting packages, wordprocessors, data analysis siftware for
> VR. VR is good for games and perhaps porn
It\'s too soon for VR, this is only tries, prototypes. There is no market
yet. Have you seen the VoicePad software program from IBM. It\'s not usable
in a professionnal environement but in few decades we would surely have
those kind of software replacing the keyboards. Now, why not connecting the
software to a Virtual secretary. This would be much better than a blank
sheet of (virtual) paper. BTW, I didn\'t have noticed but we are working on
virtual paper and using virtual mail.
IMO, VR would be used in offices but not at a so advanced way as the
private use (except in specific cases). Companies always uses new tools
with a delay. Priviate use is more a question of fashion.
TL12-15 computers definitely won\'t have any keyboards

* Invisible devices : Many devices have chips in their design. For example,
let\'s take a train wagon. It doesn\'t seem to need some calculation
capacity. Wrong, the TGV (French high speed train) has three 68000 chips
per wagon... I think this is the way that the Viruses have struck the most
heavily. Because most of the peopole didn\'t supected than the doors of the
lift where controled by a small computer which could be infected
(...crunch...)


Now, Here is my point of view on the look for TNE

* All the networks are detroyed, infected, or potentially infected. So
their use would be severly reduced. Computer should be more Personnal
Computers. The Unix type computers would be banished (because of the
easyness to start a process from a remote location). The Java type
applications would be highly dangerous. The only data that would be
exchaged by regular networks would be DATA files or eventually source codes
which could be checked before compilation.

* VR which need a huge bandwidth would be quite disapeared. Computer use
would be reserved  for specialists.

* Invisible devices : all destroyed, burned by the surviving people.
Replaced by human handle, eventually helped by computer calculations.

* New architecture : IMO The programmable computers would be converted to
nonprogrammable calculators, built for specific needs. The jump computer
cannot be used as the sensor/Navigationnal computer. The exchanged data
cannot change their nature because it\'s built like this. Sensor computer
can only give coordinates of detected taregets to the Turret/MFD systems.
The Nav computer can only specify courses to a destination point. Its
planet database is the only upgradable item. The maint computer has several
modules which depends of the equipement on the ship. A starship computer
has different componnents for redundancy. If you need another function you
cannot reprogram the computer you have to get new boards and cards.=20
All those systems are NOT DYNAMIC because a dynamic architecture is easyier
to invade than a static one. This architecture is NOT the ulitmate parade
to Virus, but it SEEMS safer for the crew (I don\'t inverted it, it\'s
written somewhere in a TNE book).=20
Oh, i forgot. The communicatior are definitely NOT connected to one of the
computer even if it\'s not programmable for obvious reasons.


IMHO of course

Does anybody have a ballpark figure here? I\'ve lost my radioastronomy books

individual photons at peak solar wavelength under ideal conditions but IR
photons are obviously much weaker.

 Either flatscreen talking heads or holographic talking heads or at higher
TLs more elaborate fullperson renderings. Very good voice that is able to
read/use nuances in speech etc.

The point is to make the computers less obtrusive and the PARC Xerox user
interface labs are working along those lines as well (XEROX PARC were the
ones that invented Etherner, the mouse, windows, icons, pull down menus
etc, basically everything we take for granted in computers today). They\'ve
built a system where for instance text input is done by hand on a piece of
paper that get OCRed by a overhead camera. The main push was to make the
computer more like a well trained british butler ie less obtrusive.

The crutial factor is not pure length, its length to beam ratio, thus a craft
with a ratio of say 1:10 will go faster than one with a ratio of 1:6. Its
generally easier to get a better ratio with a bigger ship (hulls can only
be so narrow). If you think of the hull as a knife it helps. The transom
works by using the water flow around the hull to effectively increase the
ratio at high speeds, at the cost of creating vacuum drag at low speeds.
Transoms also require the rudders to be placed further aft to get the same
manueverabilty. The other way to get more speed from a given hull is to use
a hard chined planner hull to create hydrodynamic lift and pull the hull out
of the water (hydrofoils are an extreme example of this principle), but this
has even worse affects on your craft at low speeds and is generally restricted
to small craft.

I\'ve been using such a system (and posted it to the list) for about 5 years
now. Give each sensor type (optical,radar,mass,neutrino) a factor, give
each ship a profile with factors for (optical, radar, mass, neutrino) and
some rules for it. The total lack of interest in my system last time I
posted it reduced my interest in writing it for the list (I use my own
design system etc so some modifications has to be made) but I\'ll repost it
if there\'s any interest.

    'body' => '     I found myself with some extra time this afternoon, so I went to the
game store to see if they\'d gotten the new Traveller products in, and,
sure enough, they had.  After reading Kenneth Bearden\'s glowing
recommendation, I couldn\'t not buy the Emperor\'s Arsenal, and since I was
there, they had it, and $13 isn\'t really all that much, I went ahead and
bought the Game Screen too.  The store owner complimented my choice and
made me open up the Screen so he could look at it.  What follows is my 1st
impression review, in the same format as earlier ones.

PRODUCT          Content  Production  Usefulness  Value        Overall
Emperor\'s Arsenal   A         A-          A        B+ (14-18)    A-
Game Screen         B         A-          B-       B  (8-10)     B

CONTENT is the actual written words of the book, PRODUCTION is the
editing, layout, artwork, and general physical appearance, USEFULNESS is
how much I think I\'ll use this book in actual play, VALUE is how well I
think the price of the book matches the quality of what\'s inside, the
number in parenthesis is what I think would be an appropriate price,
OVERALL is the average of the preceding four, weighted equally.

COMMENTS
GENERAL:  Both of these books reminded me very much of Classic Traveller,
both the content and the level of the production.  I consider this to be
a good thing, because while CT\'s production doesn\'t really compare to the
full-color gloss of many recent product\'s, it\'s actually a large
improvement over the rest of the T4 line so far.

EMPEROR\'S ARSENAL: Kenneth pretty much said it all in his review, and from
a quick skim-through, I agree-- this is a very good product, and pretty
much a must-by for any Traveller fan.  
     Since people haven\'t really mentioned the layout of the book, I\'ll
describe it briefly.  Each weapon description is a boxed article
containing a 1-2 paragraph description of the weapon\'s specifications and
possibly some anecdotal or historical info.  In many cases this text is
accompanied by a small picture of the weapon.  Below this, highlighted
white-text on black, are the game-stats of the weapon, which are also
repeated in a master-table for each chapter and a huge master-table at the
back of the book.  These tables are laid out with alternating blank and
shaded lines, a necessity to keep them readable.  In addition, the
chapters of weapons are interspersed with articles, with a standard text
layout like the rest of the T4 line.  
     Compared to the CSC, which was nothing but pages and pages of
barely-formatted text with an occasional full page of illustrations, this
layout is ingenious.  One slight disappointment is that it seems the color
plates of the early books are a thing of the past.  Not that I really
cared that much, except that the price of the books has stayed the same
with or without them-- if we\'re paying for them, we might as well get
them.
     Anyhow, in addition to having first-class content, this is the first
T4 product so far that actually has good layout and production-- it looks
like it was made by professionals.  There are a couple of minor errors
(missing boldface, a weapon description misplaced) and the canon-bending
(or is that breaking?) inlclusion of TL13-15 equipment for the 1st & 2nd
Imperiums, but these are very minor complaints in the face of a really
superior product.  Now, if the price were lower this would be perfect!

TRAVELLER GAME SCREEN:  I don\'t normally use a game screen as such while
actually playing-- I have nothing to hide and want to keep an eye on my
players, but I still like having all the important charts in one place, as
well as the extras that are usually included, so I usually end up buying
game screens anyway.  This package contains a four-panel medium-stock
screen, an 8pp mini-adventure, and a cover-sheet, the back of which
repeats the handouts from the adventure booklet.  Not a lot for $13, but
the contents themselves seem to be worthwhile so I\'m not really
complaining.
     Starting with the screen itself, it compiles most of the charts from
the T4 rulebook (except char-gen, starship construction, animal
encounters, and a couple others) all completely re-formatted to be
readable and look professional (including shading of alternate lines,
better use of italics, boldface, and footnotes, and more consistent and
efficient spacing).  The difference, just in presentation, in a few cases
(trade and commerce, the skill listings) is pretty drastic and makes
previously worthless tables valuable.  There are a couple of small
complaints: there should have been a skills-by-cluster listing, and an
explanation of UWP codes would have been more useful than the equipment
list, but overall they did a good job with these.
     Some tables are different, too.  The Universal Task Profile
(as presented here on 022397) is included, along with its charts for
Reactions and Uncertainty.  The Rumors table has been completely
restructured.  An Overall Ranges chart seems to be new.  Unfortunately,
the space-combat panel is exactly the same (content-wise) as the rulebook,
including the old difficulty values and the error in sandcaster ranges, as
well as accidentally formatting the Order of Events listing to look like a
table.  However, these are the only errors I\'ve noticed (value-judgments
of the task difficulties, etc, aside), and I don\'t intend to use the
rulebook space combat system anyway, so that\'s no biggie.
     The mini-adventure "Memory Alpha" seems to be an updated CT
tournament, but it now takes place in Core Sector in year 50.  The content
of the adventure is okay, and if handled well by a creative ref could work
pretty well, but the premise makes it hard to adapt to ongoing campaigns.
I\'m willing to give it some credit, though, for having more of a sense of
time/place/background than any of the other thus-far published T4
adventures (in the rulebook or JTAS25).  I\'m eagerly awaiting "Anomalies"
and "The Long Way Home" to finally get a T4 adventure that\'s more than 6pp
long.  The maps are drawn from "First Survey" and share that book\'s
uselessness (forgot to check Gov-Law) in that 1) most of them are blank,
even though the background specifically mentions that the PC ship has been
trading in this area for years, and 2) the layout doesn\'t match the UWP
presented on the screen.  However, that\'s really more of a complaint about
that product, and only tangentially affects this one.
    So, in summary, the screen itself combines many tables in a
seemingly-useful arrangement and much improved formatting over the
rulebook.  The adventure is very short, but considering that is otherwise
pretty decent.  I didn\'t really expect a whole lot out of this, and it\'s
maybe a little better than what I was expecting.  A good (if somewhat
expensive) GM screen, but nothing more than that.

So, definitely buy the Emperor\'s Arsenal; it\'s the best T4 product so far.
Take or leave the game screen, depending on if a game screen is something
you want-- not a major waste, but nothing you can\'t live without, either.

And that\'s it for my first impression.  As I take a closer look (which
with past products has meant "as I uncover more errors") these might
change, but this is how things look after a quick skim/read-through.

It is very realistic, given our understanding and current technology.

True.  So we come to the crux of it all, apart from low intensity
battles
(or soft targets) even modern aircraft are defunc?  I find it hard to
believe, its all the more worse since the last serious naval conflict
was
over 50 years ago.
<<

Yep, you got it, its just that the boys in the fighter seats have not
been told. Some expectations placed the losses in Europe at over 90% of
ALL aircraft within 1 week of WWIII starting. (that was a long time ago
when the cold war was going full on)

Many in the area of strategic planning believe that the B-52 (or Boeing
747) will be the best fighter in the next major war. Load it up with a
huge rotary rack of homing missiles and orbit next to the AWACs.
Anything that gets within 100 miles is gone. Most fighters today are
designed to fight the last war.=20

That is not to say that the Fighter is not needed. No, just the
opposite! We have entered the era of low level regional war. No one can
go around blowing everything in the sky away. (for example the Iran
Airbus over the Gulf) Everything will be controlled from the air. The
Gulf War is a great example of how it can work. Send smart missiles in,
blow the air defense away, send fighters and bombers in to check on the
situation and maintain air supremacy. Destroy anything else at your
leisure.=20

Which is exactly how the 3I will probably use them. In low level / low
threat conflicts where destruction is to be kept to a minimum. In other
words, PC area of operations. I would have to say that the PC=92s will
probably see more fighters than big ships. What better way to keep track
of what is moving in the system?

It is a shame. But can we hand wave some ideas for how to make fighters
more effective? Lets play around with some ideas:

First: Tactics

Lets say that the fighters, using high tech, high speed computers form
up into a close (lets say inches) formation. They also form a data link
for targeting and is controlled by the fighter leader. As they close
with the ship the fighters start to form into geometric patterns that
constantly change. The mass will only appear in one place for a instant,
and then morphs into another as they close with the big ship. The
targeting computer has a hard time seeing past the swarm and ID=92s it as
one target. But its center of mass is constantly shifting. This way the
fighters can close without being destroyed. As most of the beams will be
going in between the fighters.

Add in some passive arrays and a parallel processing and the sensors
would even be fairly good and the entire swarm would be one large
antenna.=20

Then throw in some ECM or Masking for good measure just to blur the
lines even more and presto, you have a way to close with out having all
the fighters destroyed. You may loose a few but the computers would
automatically close the holes in the system.

Hey, you could even throw in some drones that act as fillers for the
squadron, and/or weapon pods. Which brings me to my next point.

Second: Weapons

Missiles do not seem to be a very viable option for the fighter. So lets
look at energy weapons. They will have to be long range, as no matter
how good the fighters are and moving around, the big ship will pick them
off at close range. And them have to be powerful enough to damage a
large ship. The current power requirements of the most powerful weapons
do not allow the fighter to carry them. But that assumes that the
fighter has to be able to fire the weapon continually. What if we give
the fighter only enough power for one shot through the use of some high
tech power storage. Picture a huge plasma gun or something. The fighter
swarm closes to 60,000 km and fires that weapon. 100% chance of a hit
due to the size of the large ship. Major damage and the fighters return
to the carrier and rearm for the next trip.

Just an idea that come to me on the long flight home.

I think it\'s important to remember the management change at IG.  This is
clearly having its good effects, but they won\'t be instant.  Changing the
past products is possible only by releasing updates, and changing the
course of the products as a whole is like, well, changing the course of a
1G freighter. :)

I agree with Anders as to why it\'s not there, but I wonder if the
hermetically sealed nature of the Traveller system is going to be a help or
a hindrance in the overall market.  I\'m not saying it should be a cyberpunk
game (we\'ve got too many of those as it is, and I can take only so much
nihilism), but in its image of computers, government, bioengineering,
nano-engineering, and even its vision of military units, doctrine, and
weapons, Traveller has maintained a decided 1970s big-iron, big-government,
big-product, big-war feel.

Exactly what I tried to get through!
There won\'t be any VR for normal computer use (goggles, gloves, suits et c.
Instead there\'ll be a virtual secretary you talk to that may or may not be
a hologram walking about. What I (and most people) call VR is the kind of
immersive VR where a compleat reality is fictiously created around you (the
R in VR) not a software simulation of something like wordprocessor software
which are loose sims of typewriters. In the future and especially in
Traveller you\'ll have virtual persons/employees that you interface by
talking, gesturing etc to be as humanlike and unobtrusive as possible.

DGP used these things at TL 16 but I forgot what they called them. Some
kind of personality simulation software to simulate a meeting with a person
that couldn\'t be there.

	I thought it was chicken-guided?  I have footage of it somewhere.
It has Skinner droning on about something, and a mock-up of the guidance
system.  There was a small (primitive) TV screen in front of the chicken.
The chicken was trained to peck at certain silhouettes, such as those of
ships.  The bird would peck, and the bomb would realign itself according
to the stimuli on the small screen.  They continued working on it past
WWII, but captured German TV-Guided technology was better, and by \'50 the
tubes were starting to get smaller.

Not neccesarily so.  You should read about "Solar Wind", "Background
Radiation Levels," "Vacuum Polarization," and "Solar Flares."

Actually, the masks blur the heat dissipation, thus causing the IR 
signal to be harder to get a "lock" on.  Plus, if they haven\'t allready
figured that you are out there, you can easily blend in.  With the 
propagation of EM radiation over thousands of kilometers, it would be
easy to hide a ship.

Or if you use a bunch of the laws of physics that the poster obviously
hasn\'t looked into.

Post a message to Usenet asking for the old Grenadier "Alien Mercenaries"
figures. There are two Vargr figures per box. I\'ve stockpiled a bunch of
these for my own campaign and they are excellent!

You may have to pay a bit through the nose for these, but IMO, they\'re
worth it. The box also includes two Aslans, two Droyne, a Hiver, a Virushi

Banking isn\'t analogus to traveller at all.  Rotation is created by
offset use of attitude control thrusters.  The acceleration is given
by v^2/r, where v is the tangential velocity of the end of the ship
(2*pi*r/period_of_rotation).

This is true, but it\'s a function of structure and g-comp.  I  think
design rules should have something about this someplace.

Yeah, but with Traveller, it is easy enough to change it. CT had 
megacorporations already, and the basic motivations for a dystopia 
like cyberpunk settings (overpopulation, greed, crime) are still 
there in selected spots. Rules for cybernetics are easily adapted 
from other games (personally, I just equate cyber with stat adds, 
depending on the system...for example, a cyberarm could be +1-3 Str, 
one arm only. The arm doesn\'t heal (at least not until tech 15+) on 
it\'s own, and it might have add-ins for greater functionality (the 
aforementioned chain-saw hand comes to mind).

All Cyberpunk is, is a darker feel in your SF with (argueably) more 
realistic (or more character-centered) plots (not to mention 
technical trappings). People who like the Scout campaigns, or classic 
space opera don\'t like it, and that\'s okay. People who do like c-punk 
shouldn\'t have any problems adapting Traveller to suit. It isn\'t very 
hard at all...

I wonder if IG would be interested in a "CyberTraveller" supplement? 
Heck, I have the working notes already...

===============================================================================

The Vilani Occupation

	After the war, Sharurshid  started a long-term plan to bring the Geonee
worlds into the Vilani society. The "original" eight worlds were almost
isolated, and all contact with former Geonee colonies was prohibited. In
each world, traditional Geonee government structures were slowly substituted
by Vilani bureaucracy. Geonee traders were forced to work for Sharurshid,
and technological research was all but stopped by the introduction of the
patent system.
	In -4,700, it was obvious that Sharurshid plan was not working. An armed
rebellion in Forquee generalized to almost all the Geonee worlds in less
than a year. Civil unrest spread to other subject races, and Sharurshid
faced the possibility of a generalized insurrection. The Ziru Sirka Navy was
ordered to crush the Geonee rebellion by all means. Forquee suffered orbital
nuclear bombardment, and almost half of the world population died. The
Vilani marines ruthlessly repressed the insurrection on all the Geonee worlds.
	For the following centuries, the Vilani systematically tried to eliminate
the Geonee as a major influence in Massilia. Their worlds were under
military rule, and most communities were evacuated or forced to meet strict
population control measures to reduce their numbers in a few generations.
Around year -4,100, many of the Geonee colonies in Massilia had been
depopulated and resettled with Vilani colonists. Nevertheless, Geonee
communities (sometimes large) survived in at least thirty worlds in Massilia.
	For the following two millennia, the Geonee were a subject race in the Ziru
Sirka. The military rule was eventually eliminated, but all Geonee worlds
were always ruled by Vilani bureaucrats. Occasional uprisings were promptly
and quietly crushed, and law levels were kept high.

The Vilani-Solomani War

	In -2,235,  the Nth Interstellar War erupted between the Vilani Ziru Sirka
and the recently contacted Solomani humans from Terra. The declining Vilani
empire was overwhelmed by the Solomani.
	The Geonee welcomed the newcomers as liberators. The Geonee worlds rebelled
against the Ziru Sirka and promptly allied themselves with the terrans.
	Quickly organized Geonee naval forces and troops comprised a high
percentage of the "Solomani" forces in Massilia during the war. Geonee
communities became advanced bases and safe bases for the terran forces.
	The Geonee minority of Forquee, repressed for centuries, conducted an
extermination campaign against the Vilani population of the world. Their
vengeance lead them to the commission of war crimes almost as harsh as those
commited against them two thousand years before by the Vilani.
	Interestingly, the Geonee naval forces used thousands of Llyrnians as
starship troopers during the war. This started a now long tradition of
Llyrnian marines and mercenaries serving in Geonee ships.
	When the war ended with the conquest of all the Ziru Sirka by the terran
forces, the Solomani were forced to rule over a vast territory, a situation
which forced them to put even simple lieutenants in charge of whole systems.
Thus, it is not surprising that the Solomani relied heavily on Geonee
advisors in the Massilia sector.

The Rule of Man

	Shortly after the end of the war, the Second Imperium (or Rule of Man) was
established. In -2,200, Emperor Hiroshi I granted autonomy to the Geonee
worlds, which formed the Geonee Autonomous Region jointly with Tlasov
(1328), Nindaro (1428) and Llyrn (0931).
 	It was a time of euphory for the Geonee. The Vilani bureaucracy was
eliminated, and all restrictions on research and technology abolished. The
Rule of Man allowed the Geonee to freely travel through known space, and
some new worlds were settled. Nevertheless, all Geonee worlds or colonies,
new or old, outside the Autonomous Region were under the direct authority of
the Solomani government.
	The Rule of Man found the post-war situation in Forquee specially delicate.
An almost genocidal war had been fought between the Geonee and the Vilani
inhabitants of the world, and the world infrastructures were severely
damaged. Forquee was placed under military rule to avoid a continuous
conflict and direct the energies of both Vilani and Geonee towards
reconstruction. Some decades later, a Solomani settlement was established to
serve as buffer between the two communities.
	In -2,000, several Geonee worlds were at TL 12, on the cutting edge of
technology. Interstellar trade was flourishing, and it seemed that the long
Vilani occupation was all but forgotten. Once again, the Geonee were a
common vision on Massilia and beyond. The Solomani love for personal
independence and initiative matched perfectly well with the Geonee
instincts. They promptly developed a well-deserved fame of being excellent
technicians.

Oh Goody! A chance to plug BTRC again!

Guns Guns Guns is a pan-game system weapons design system by Greg Porter,
author of T4 CSC. It is a rather gearhead oriented system, that then
includes scads of conversion tables to the game system of your choice in
the back (which includes TNE, T4 and MegaT).

BTRC\'s web site is:

http://members.aol.com/btrc/index.html

It is avaliable online from Hyperbooks online,

http://www.hyperbooks.com

	For me the best deal was the all-electronic version, which
includes the main rulebook in a well done adobe .pdf format with embedded
hyperlinks, notes and index, in printable form. You can also get Excel
spreadsheets that automate the entire design process. The all electronic
version is only $12.95, I heartily recommend it.

This is what gaming supplements are SUPPOSED to look like!

    'body' => '    I\'ve been following the debate over Fighters with some interest, playing
catch up on some 30+ Digests as I am. :\\ But the one thing that keeps getting
pointed out is that Fighters do not appear to have a ship killing on the order
of the Torpedo or Missile as they\'ve evolved durring the course of Warfare
throughout the Twentieth Century here on Earth.  Problem is no one is thinking
in terms of future technologies or the possibilities.
    I could be wrong OC, I still have some ten Digests to go so someone could
have thought of this but I can think of two seperate ways to give a Fighter in
space the ability to seriously threaten a BB.

    1) Take a missle and give it 1,000g of acceleration for 300 seconds.  You
now have a missile moving at your target at .01c and that WILL punch through
just about any armor you care to put on the ship.  At the worst case senario
the target is going to have to expend a LOT of energy trying to vaporize the
incoming missile.
    This is by necessity a stand off weapon, the distance required to build up
final velocity makes it so.  Meaning that the Fighter has an excellent chance
of getting close enough to launch it and then get away to reload and come back
again.  The incoming missile to the target is going to be coming in head on,
thus presenting a minimal target profile.
    And while 1,000g for 300 seconds is brutal, I do believe it would be
possible to design a guidence system for such a missle that would withstand the
initial accelleration.  This means the missle can lock onto it\'s target and
compensate for the rather violent manuever the target is going to go through
trying to avoid being hit.

    2) One word _antimatter_ as in placed in the warhead.  Nuclear Dampers will
not effect antimatter, completely different forces involved.  The destructive
potential is I believe 100x more powerful then thermonuclear weapons.  A direct
hit would kill your average superdreadnaught I believe.  Antimatter is
something we\'re producing right now, abet in the form of subatomic particles.
Still given the advances of succeeding Tech Levels it\'s probably that by Tech
12 the technology will exist to manufacture, manipulate, store and deploy
antimatter weapons.

    Suddenly we now have two means by which Fighters could kill BBs.  Doubtless
these would be less successful then using another BB.  But as a potential
threat, no sane Admiral will ignore them.  Thus Fighters would have a variety
of roles in space warfare.  Not as the ruler of the vaccum or some other
nonsense, but as a capably multi-purpose weapons platform.

Yeah, that is the problem... the main problem is (of course) thus:

Ship A (Attacker) takes out the Thrusters on Ship B (Being Borded).
But if Ship B still has altitude jets, it can start spinning on
multiple axes which make it impossible to board. Hm...

One thing you might do is send over a couple of guys in EVA suits who
would:

first, get close the the ship and try to find a spot where they could
get onto the hull withough getting destroyed. Probably a man-portable
grapple would be good, because as soon as it hits it\'ll jerk the guy into
motion and he can reel it in to get onto the hull (assuming the guy is
~200 kg with suit, grapple, et al, you should be able to get cable tough
enough to handle a couple Gs of pull, for a short time period).
OK, so now one or two boarders are on the hull. Here\'s the tough part -
they have to plug up Ship B\'s altitude jets and plant a big altitude jet
of their own on the hull to counter Ship B\'s spin and get it so that
ship A can come alongside and fire off the real boarding party.

Now, that\'s not going to be easy. But it would probably make for good
gaming...

    'from' => 'Christopher M. Russell',
    'body' => 'I haven\'t had the time to read all the posts concerning fighters, nor is
there ever likely going to be enough hours in a day for me to do so. Most of
the one\'s I have read have had good points. I have not yet had the
opportunity to purchase T4, so I do not know how this system changes the
Traveller universe concerning fighters. When I do start my own designing for
T4, I will likely use the more detailed design system when it comes out.

As an example of how I would use fighters, I\'ve theorized how an encounter
with two well equipped oponents would develope. This assumes Traveller level
technology (approx 13) with one fleet, called Blue, arriving to invade a
system owned by Orange, with the primary objective to secure one of the Gas
Giants in the system as a base of operation for futire use in securing the
whole of the system. Note most of the references to actual weapons will be
using MegaTraveller rules sets.

Blues fleet, knowing that jumping in next to Oranges Gas Giants would be
scuicide, arrives with tankers in interplanetary space, at lease 2 days
flight from their target. They bring in a fleet of 5 Dreadnaughts with about
30 Light Cruisers for screen and an additional 5 heavy cruisers as a forward
scout. Troop carrying ships would be carefully screened inside the
dreadnaught formation.

In addition, 2 carriers are brought along with the following type of fighters: 

- - Two wings (about 200) of interceptors with a tripple beam laser
configuration, giving them the ability to group into flights of 10 to render
a combined effective battery UCP (at TL13) of 9, a respectable amount of
firepower. The interceptors will be built for speed, perhaps with some
sacrifice given to their fuel load. These will initially provide screen for
the refueling of the fleet from any SDB\'s and deep space fighters, assisting
the light cruisers, and shooting down any incoming warheads.

- - One wing (about 150) of deticated attack fighter/bombers. These will have
some light laser armament, possibly fixed mount beam lasers that can be
combined for a light beam battery, but their main armament will be a missile
turret. Grouping them into flights of 10 with a tripple rack each will give
(at TL13) a battery rating of 7, meaning that if the entire wing of 150
attacks one target, it will be subject to 15 missile attacks at UCP 7, not
excessive, but respectable. These fighters would also have a bay where
ground attack ordinance could be carried.

- - One wing (about 50) of long range fighters. These would be used for
reconosance, serching out concentrations of ships and facilities, updating
data on the system as much as possible. They would have the best possible
sensors as well as accomidations for multi - day missions. The fuel
requirements and accomodations would make these ships large, and, as
unreported information is no information, the need for survivability would
make a need for speed and firepower equally important. As such, these
fighters have a tripple, fixed forward firing beem laser and a missile
turret, lending them equally handy in the approaching battle. Many would
call these ships small gunboats, but their size and use render them more on
the scale of (very expensive) fighters.

- - Three wings (about 300) of space superiority fighters. These nimble little
machines would be the ships escorting the attack bombers to their targets.
Unlike the interceptors, their main need is agility and endurance, with
firepower important, but number 2 on the list. Since agility is fundamental,
a powerful power plant is needed. Noting then power is in abundance with the
engines, the weapon configuration becomes a pair of fusion guns with a pulse
laser for longer range fire. In close, these fusion guns would be lethal. It
is not likely these fighters would need to be grouped into batteries in one
- - on - one dogfights, but in close to a large target, the fusion guns would
be very effective (groups of 10 with 2 guns each equals a UCP of 8).

Orange, in it\'s system, has 8 battleriders with dozens of SDB\'s, carriers,
and fighters with similar capabilities to Blue\'s fighters. Orange detects
Blue\'s fleet shortly after arrival, but has not localized it. Sending out
it\'s first wave of SDB\'s and fighters, the enemy is localized approaching
one of the outlying Gas Giants. Blue detects the approacing SDB\'s with the
recon squadron, and vectors a heavy cruiser, some light cruisers, and the
attack wing, under escort, to engage.

Assuming that this first wave of SDB\'s and fighters are neutralized, the
approach to the Gas Giant would continue. Orange would have at most 2
battleriders around the Giant, suplimented by no more than 30 SDB\'s.
However, by this time more battleriders, SDB\'s, and carriers would be on
their way, with some perhaps moving to other points in the system watching
for more Blue forces to arrive. Also, couriers would have been sent to call
in reinforcements from other systems, but these would be arrriving at the
earliest in 2 weeks.

The first target for this invader is the world around the Gas Giant holding
the SDB base. This world is also equiped with a few deep meson guns, so
bringing large ships into orbit is scuicide. Fast troop shuttles, under
escort from the superiority fighters and supported by some of the attack
fighters, must attempt to land near the base, securing it and the guns as
quickly as possible. Careful planning chose this one since this world is the
only one around this Gas Giant with such a base, so only this world needs a
major assult. Orange has many fighters and SDB\'s defending this world, so
before the attack begins, some softening up will be done with the attack
wing, picking off the SDB\'s and fighters a few at a time, trying to get them
to persue back toward the fleet into the range of the fleet\'s guns.

Eventually, and probably before the assult on the planet begins, Blue and
Orange fleets will engage. Several reconosance fighters would have  been
shadowing both the battleriders already around the giant, staying in far
orbit avoiding Oranges SDB\'s and fighters as much as possible, and the
approaching battlerider squadron. Heavy cruisers would occasionally pick at
the approaching fleet, weekening it\'s SDB screen. If possible, the fleet
around the Gas Giant would be engaged long before the reinforcements could
arrive, making a fight of 5 dreadnaughts and 30 light cruisers against the 2
battleriders and the remainder of the SDB\'s. However, with the deep meson
guns on the planet, Orange\'s fleet at the Gas Giant would likely remain
within that protective cover, holding out until the second fleet arrives. 

Blue, prudently, decides to attack the reinforcements first.

Oranges reinforcements are 6 battleriders and 50 SDB\'s. Orange\'s SDB\'s can
match about 15 to 1 against Blue\'s light cruisers. Blue\'s gamble is that it
can likely engage the reinforcements far enough away from the Gas Giant to
prevent a flanking maneuver from the fleet there if such a maneuver is
attempted. If a flanking maneuver is attempted, a heavy cruiser will
standing by to help escort a strike group to take the planet. If there is no
flanking maneuver, then hopefully enough of Blue\'s fleet will survive to
engage the fleet at the Gas Giant. Recall Blue jumped in with tankers, which
did leave soon after, so it does have enough fuel to jump out if all goes
wrong, even though this would abandon most of the fighters, but if that is
needed, most of the fighters would likely be long destroyed.

In the long run, of course, this battle will be won by the side that made
best use of available assets. Blue\'s interceptors would need to guard
against Orange\'s attack fighters while surviving Orange\'s superiority
fighters. Same holds true for Orange\'s interceptors. Blue\'s attack wing must
clear out as many of Orange\'s SDB\'s as possible, staying alive to help with
the battleriders if needed, and staying in enough strength to attack the
planet if needed. Since the biggest advantage of the fighter is it\'s
mobility and flexibility, the fighters must be applied where they would do
most good, and this will vary from moment to moment in the battle.

This encounter is fairly general, and there are many additions that could be
factored into both sides of the equation. Each of the ships in the fleet
(with the possible exception if the SDB\'s) could have small fighter
squadrons onboard which would be a further enhancement of capabilities.

I have a few fighter designs of my own and have a couple of as yet untried
"house rules" that could enhance thr fighters place on the battlefield. I
won\'t get into them in this post (as it is long enough as is) but I can post
them in a later message if requested.

I believe Pocket Empires will be the first book to have advertising copy 
on the back cover. Marc has introduced several changes in the IG line, 
and they\'re coming into play now.  You saw some of the new layout 
philosophy in Emperor\'s Aresenal (couldn\'t do a lot with it, given the 
nature of the product), and you\'ll see more in Pocket Empires, Anomalies, 
Psionic Institutes, and future projects.  He also has introduced some 
changes to the cover design, which is seen first on the Game Screen, and 
will be continued on all future projects.  EA wasn\'t included for 
scheduling reasons, but PE is supposed to have back cover ad copy.

This may work, and would be quite large, but I doubt that it would need to

Actually, if tech level is the same as it has been in the last three
Traveller incarnations, Antimatter is at least a tech 16 development. Even
today, we can barely produce enough to learn about some of it\'s properties,
but we cannot produce enough to be of significantce (perhaps one or two
particals at most). If one takes the past trends in partical physics as any
clue, we aren\'t going to see practical antimatter uses for thousands of
years, baring any more dark ages.

Some ideas for fighters.  First, use passive sensors, with a Ladar on 
the side.  Using the sensor handoff rules, the tender, or flag ship,
(or maybe a modified fighter) locks on to the enemy ship.  It then hands
the sensor lock off to the squadron (5-10) of fighters.  They then
either keep the lock with a Ladar, or with a PEMS system.

Second, missles are actually fairly nice (They actually can do quite a
bit of damage to a Capital ship--I once took out a Sylea BB with 4 400dt
SDBs!), but you mount them with external grapples, and you either have
a MFD gunner in the fighter (ie a two man fighter ala the Tomcat IIRC), 
or have some MFDs on the Flag Ship with 1000AU Laser communicators.

Third, maybe mounting some missles with area Jammers would help.  As the
missles aren\'t attached to the fighters, the enemy ships can\'t use the
jamming to lock on with passive sensors.  Give the missles EMM, and you
have a light RCV with the capability of lasting for quite some time (as
it will be tough to hit).

Mount a few (2-3) light laser lances capable of full auto.  Use these
to ruin enemy sensors.

All fighters should have Lascoms to communicate.  If the TL allows use
Meson communicators.

OK--that is all for now.

Exactly!!!

I don\'t want cyberpunk Traveller, I want a Traveller which takes into
account realistic advances in science and technology.  Traveller as "the
game of 1960s/ 70s SF" is an amazingly dull idea to me.  I want Traveller
to be a game of *modern* science fiction.  Not cyberpunk, but SF which
takes all the advances in computer technology and genetic engineering into
account. 

Hell, in last weeks paper I saw an article about how Monsanto had breed a
plant (old rape seed) which contained plastic in its leaves and seeds. 
They expect to begin making bottles and bags out of this plastic within a
decade.  [fortunately this plastic is also quite biodegradable]. 

The farm worlds and factory worlds set up of Traveller simply doesn\'t make
sense in light of 90s technology.  With CSC and EA the actual technology
in the game is getting better (though its still too conservative) but the
social changes produced by these technologies are largely ignored.

Bruce,

So, if I\'m reading you right, this game system is directly related to 
T4?

I can use it to design T4 weapons by using the actual T4 conversion 
tables?  You mean I don\'t have to play a GM\'s hunch when converting 
to T4.

If this is so, I had no idea.  I thought it was for another game 
system.  I\'ll definitely get it if it is directly related to T4.

Big deal.  Just as is true for atmospheric fighters, coming in out of the
sun fools both the Mk I eyeball and a lot of IR sensors.  For really
primitive sensors, that is.  For *really* bad sensors, you can draw its
attention away by getting *near* the sun along its LOS.  In fact, this was
a standard defense back in the early to mid sixties against IR homing
missiles...get between them and the Sun, then sharply veer off to turn
your own exhaust away.  The poor dumb missile would proceed to try to
bring down the Sun.

In your typical space battle, with a semi-habitable world nearby, your
heat sources are: 

* The star, a very strong blackbody thermal source at about 10,000 K,
  angular diameter <1 degree.

* The stellar extended atmosphere/wind, a very weak thermal source at
  several million K, covering nearly half the sky.

* Zodiacal dust, an incredibly weak thermal source at 100-400K or so,
  all over the sky but strongly concentrated along the ecliptic plane.

* The world, a strongish blackbody thermal source at about 300 K,
  angular diameter <120 degrees, much less in most cases.

* Perhaps some moons, also at about 300K, angular diameters typically
  <1 degree unless the battle focusses around one of them.

All other sources (including cosmic 3 K background and so forth) are
negligible for our purposes.

Now, what are the heat sources on board a starship?

* Living/work space, at 300 K.

* Fusion chamber, at perhaps 100,000 K

Living and work spaces fill most Traveller ships, meaning that at minimum
a vessel will have a blackbody signature of 300 K.  Depending on how much
waste heat the fusion process produces, the net effective temp will be
higher, or perhaps you\'ll have a two-humped IR signature...a 300 K signal
superimposed on a (say) 5,000 K fusion cooling grid signature.

Note carefully that the only strong IR source in that latter range in the
entire system is the star itself, with a tiny angular diameter.  You can
sneak up on one (stupid) vessel by boring in straight out of the sun, but
the trick doesn\'t work on two or more ships more than a few thousand km
apart.

Now, a ship with its power plant off could hide reasonably well against
the background of a habitable world, in low orbit...but presumably
everyone knows that trick and will go active there if an initial passive
sweep doesn\'t turn anything up.

The only way to "smear" an IR signal as you suggest is to dump hot
*material* (gas, dust, whatever) overboard, and in large quantities.
Traveller ships don\'t carry enough spare mass to do this trick.

Now, you *can* drop decoy flares or drones, just as modern aircraft do.

As for propagation drop...I really think you\'re seriously underestimating
just how intrinsically IR \'bright\' a starship is, *by its very nature*
(having fusion and livable quarters on board).  Also, remember we\'re
talking about band-sensitive sensors -- hiding a fusion drive against a
habitable planet or the corona won\'t work, because the spectrum will stand
out like a sore thumb.

Having made my living off sensors for a number of years (not any more,
though), I hope you\'ll trust that I\'m giving you the straight dope here.

Quicker refers to acceleration, faster to top speed. But that\'s symantics,

Interesting idea, but remember that antimatter powerplats don\'t appear
until TL 17 (according to FFS), now you are saying that weapons and
powerplants are two completely different things. That is true, but they
are not so different thing as to allow weapons using antimatter 5 TLs
before. It is very hard to keep antimatter stable, and think about the
stress 1000g acceleration would put on the containment chamber... One
minor error and the missile would blow at launch. Not a very nice thing
to do, but missiles don\'t discriminate too much... :)

Hmmm.  Not this year, as far as I know.  But, when I look at things as 
they\'re shaping up, I see that by the end of this year, we\'ll have 
almost everything else, rules-wise, in place (including revisions).  

Books of starships, vehicles, equipment, weapons.  A more robust, better 
stated QSDS, and the full-up FF&S ship design systems.  Vehicle design.  
A FFW-type large-scale wargame (Imperial Squadrons).  Lots of background 
on M0.  A few adventures.  A how-to on starship layout and operation.

I\'d say next year should see the rest of the missing pieces...assuming 
they plan on putting out a miniatures game.  Lord knows I\'d like to 
see the Role-Playing Space Combat system (also a miniatures game) 
published.  And a revised edition of the original Striker wouldn\'t make 
me upset, either. :)

Soon as I hear anything, I\'ll let you know.

	Let\'s see... Pigeon guidance was being implemented in order to

I think the Navy admits to something like 40 knots (any squids out
there?).  Stories about "rushing to a liberty port" abound in
sci.military.naval at some absurdly high speed.

35 knots is about right for the older Big E. And that is with 4 of her
eight reactors off line.

We were doing about 33 knots when the Carl V. passed us in the IO. She
had a rooster tail going back about 100 feet and made us look like we
were sitting still. I would say about 45 knots is the VERY top speed for
those newer carriers. But that would place a lot of stress on the entire

Why a LOT of energy?  Even a marginal hit (at a non-evading target
heading straight ahead) will take out its guidance systems, allowing
the target to simply "side-step" the blind missile.  I do not believe
that point defense use of lasers vs. missiles ever mentioned
"vapourizing" them, although I could be wrong.

Wrong.  Antimatter in the Traveller universe isn\'t available as a
power source (and this would _include_ harnessing it for use as a
weapon) until TL 17+.

If you chose to defy Traveller "canon", you could just as easily
create a weapon based on high-energy particle accelerators firing
particles of antimatter.  These weapons wouldn\'t have to be very
powerful, since they would rely on the interaction between matter and
antimatter to do most of the damage (they might even be used in
point-defense).  Now the rules of combat must change again...

Some good thoughts, if one ship has a lock then thru a Tactical Data Link
using some form of tighbeam comms, them all ships sharing the link can
compute the Firecontrol solution for thier weapons to tehe target.

I dont think it would be beyond the realm of traveller to build a small

I dont have anything for point b) but point a) i have already mentioned in
another post some intresting, albeit short ranged, missile weapons that
pack a punch.  Another modification would be that a missile would have no
fuel or engine.  The fighter zooms in and "drops" the missile, the missile
would continue to travel at the speed and vector of its initial drop and
hit the capital ship.  Taking away fuel/engine from the missile would
leave more room for explosives.

I think the reason for the lack of L-Hyd tanks may be because they won\'t be
invented in the Imperium for a Millennium or so.

As for the design, overall very good and solid.  Only thing that I think that
would improve it would be a write-up with a bit more color to it.

My understanding is that Striker wasn\'t playtested the first time around,
or that at least the vehicle construction part wasn\'t.  I hope any new
release of it won\'t be just a regurgitation of what went before.

And... add my vote to the "No more Chris Foss art" cabal.  I _like_ the
look of it, but it\'d be difficult to get art where the style was further
from Traveller without putting cute unicorns or something in it.  I think
players want somethign that they could conceivably say "yeah, we went
_there_ in _that_ ship!"

Yes it is true, 3G3 is what Greg used to design the weapons for CSC and EA.
I have  the hardback version, and the spreadsheet too.

The spreadsheet has conversions for MT/TNE/T4, the hardback has conversions
for TNE/T4. I do not know about the acrobat version.

Greg Porter has a day gig when not at IG called BTRC, which did such execlent systems like 
CORPS, Timelords,Black Death, 3G3 (Guns Guns Guns), Timelords, Slag and others. If you want 
more, look at Greg\'s homepage at http://members.aol.com/btrc 
 
If you want to buy 3g3, go to the hyperbooks link on Greg\'s page, you can get PDF and book 
versions of his games.

I hate this Fighter thread.

The ground beneath the greasy spot where the horse once was is worn down
to the bedrock.

That said, I just discovered something that seemingly hasn\'t come up yet
regarding the acceleration advantage of fighters. Sure, Leonard has
pointed out that fighters will have a greater G capability due to the
single pilot etc etc etc.

But having recently gotten my grubby fingers on a copy of CSC, I have
discovered something embedded in the Vehicle Design Rules:

Compensators can be stacked!

Want 9G compensation at TL-12? Simple. Multiply 3G compensator volume by
3. Envelop pilot\'s area (2 cu. m or so). Pay through the nose. Remember:
The structure must be designed to handle the desired G\'s.

According to CSC:

    Comp. Vol. = ( Desired G Comp. / Max. G Comp ) ^ 3 * Std. Vol.

Granted, the vehicle design rules were not designed to be compatible
with QSDS or SSDS.

But if Traveller Technology allows it, then it can be done, dang-nab it.

PS. This doesn\'t mean I think Loonies with Fighters should attack the
nearest dreadnaught. Fighters have specialized roles, and taking on a
big ship isn\'t one of them.

Well not quite anymore, EA page 104 has AM firing gauss rifle at TL16? and
a Contragrav rifle that uses AM for fuel giving it 1.8 billion G\'s, and it
is listed as TL16?

IMHO this is a fallacious argument, because the ships are being built by
civilizations spanning whole solar systems, with populations in the
billions. This means that the top 1% can be measured by the million. I\'m
sure that with this many people to choose from you could find a G-tolerant
crew for your entire fleet, since aside from Ed. Hamilton\'s old stories most
Sci-fi environments seems to have very small space fleets for their
population bases.

  And look at what they had to work with. Today\'s pilots deal with much more
advanced concepts, maneuvers, speeds, equipment and armament. This results in
a much longer training time.

  There is absolutely NO way you could adequately train a brand new O-1 to
fly an F-16 or F-15 in 2-4 months. It would never happen. Heck, I doubt if
pilots even get into a plane in the first few months of training, nevermind
flying solo. And that\'s just in the T-37 and T-38 trainers!

   I\'m fixing all the stellar data at this very moment.  The UWPs will

Beta Pictoris, which I had to make an adjustment to the gas giant and

sector with what appears to be a flawed piece of software (more on that
in a moment).  At the very least it did not incorporate any of changes
that took place in the stellar generation tables since Book 6, and it
*desperately* needs fixed as a result.

   Some other observations:

1) There seems to be an inordinate number of large stars in this
sector.  I\'m not sure if it was a software problem or just a bizarre
coincidence.  I\'m leaning toward a problem with the software at this
point, because...

2) ...check out the adjusted percentages of the various types of primary
stars.  I say "adjusted" because this includes the original data with
fixes for the known bright stars incorporated.
       percent  #
   O - 0.00    (0)
   B - 0.61    (3)
   A - 4.31    (21)
   F - 2.25    (11)
   G - 12.73   (62)
   K - 25.05   (122)
   M - 55.03   (268)

   Note that type \'A\' stars outnumber type \'F\'.  This simply should not
be the case.  Type \'A\' stars make up about 1 percent of all stars in the
Universe.  There were also an inordinate number of subgiant, giant, and
supergiant stars, though I don\'t have the exact statistics at hand.

3) Going through the UWPs I\'m struck by the large number of size \'1\'
worlds.  I\'m not sure why this is, but it may be worth further study. 
Hopefully it is not a repeat of the T4 bad UWP data problem (where all
the law levels turn out to be exactly the same as the government code).

4) Under alliegence, many worlds are listed as \'Na\' for non-aligned. 
This doesn\'t mesh with all the maps of Known Space I\'ve ever seen, which
clearly show most of the sector being part of the Solomani Confederation
and the remainder belonging to the Imperium.  While you could say the
non-aligned worlds are "associate" members of the Confederation, this
makes no sense since by being associate members of the Confederation,
they are by default *aligned* with something.

>There is also two stars which are in an empty Hex. Do we
> have to move or  create a world in this Hex??

   This should not be the case, since I made sure that the Known Stars
had hex locations that corresponded with an existing system.  If I did
goof however, I\'ll recheck everything and fix it in the final draft.

then why even send a pilot?  A missle, controlled by a MFD, can be flown out
to a point where it goes active and attacks the next thing that meets it\'s

withstand 50+ g\'s?  Don\'t send what is essentialy a passenger along.

Was the original German TV-Guidance wire or radio based?  If I\'m recalling

seaplanes to attack shipping.

Not specifically.  It was designed for BTRC\'s TimeLords(tm) because
that game already used a large number of weapon "facts" to define
weaponry.  3G3 (third edition) was released last month, and uses its
own rules to build weapons.  The last 40 pages or so give you specific
procedures to convert any weapon-- built using the 3G3 rules-- into a
number of other RPGs (including Corps, GURPS, Cyberpunk, MasterBook,
T4, TNE, Battlelords of the 23rd Century, Nexus, Feng Shui, Heavy
Gear, and the HERO Games system).

Let me just define the procedure for building weapons with 3G3.

1) Build your weapon using the 3G3 rules in the front two-thirds of
   the book.  The procedure is very detailed and takes the same route
   as FF&S (regarding realism and accuracy).

2) Once you have the weapon built with 3G3 attributes, you use the
   procedure for the appropriate RPG to define the weapon in terms of
   that system.  By designing a weapon once, you can introduce that
   weapon into *any* of the RPG systems included in the last 40 pages!

That\'s it!

Someone mentioned that CSC had rules to design equipment.  Since that
book was also written by Greg Porter, I can only assume that many of
the weapon design rules for 3G3 were altered slightly and included in
CSC.  So here\'s *my* question: Can you build weapons using CSC?

	Not bloody likely, unless the capital ship is completely dead in space,
without even attitude thrusters. Either you launch it an incredible
distance off, in which case I\'ve got plenty of time to shoot it down, or
change my projected position at intercept by a small amount, or you try to
come in close and die before you launch it.

	Now, if you\'ve got several hundred of these fighters, all manned by
suiciders, you could come at me from all directions, each launching several
of these. My capital ship will kill most of the fighters and/or missiles,
but there\'s a miniscule chance that one of the remaining missiles might
possible hit me.

	But I doubt it.

	Well, it\'s what Greg used to create the weapons in T4. It\'s actually for a
different game (I believe his own game), but provides rules in the back for
determining stats for a bunch-o-games (CORPS, GURPS, Timelords, Masterbook,
TNE, T4, Hero, Cyberpunk 2020, Battlelords, Nexus, Heavy Gear). Online, you
can even place a secure order for an electronic version (Adobe Acrobat),
with spreadsheets (various formats), and download it a day later. That\'s
what I did, and it\'s incredibly cheap. Don\'t take my word for it, go look
yourself.

	Actually, I\'m embarrassed to admit I don\'t even remember how much it cost,
or the URL of the online store that sold it to me. But you can get there
from Greg\'s web page.

>I can use it to design T4 weapons by using the actual T4 conversion 
>tables?  You mean I don\'t have to play a GM\'s hunch when converting

	Yes.

>If this is so, I had no idea.  I thought it was for another game 
>system.  I\'ll definitely get it if it is directly related to T4.

	Again, not directly related, but useable. I haven\'t decided whether I like
it yet, but I\'m rather persnickety. Greg seems very thorough. The biggest
issue I\'ve seen, browsing through it, is that no matter how big a weapon
gets, his T4 conversion produces a damage of 3D. Period.

	Regardless of my personal opinion about this stuff, I\'d still recommend it
to any gearhead, if just as a resource. Greg does good work, and it\'s quite
cheap (around US$15, I believe).

	Perhaps. It took us forever to convince him that a tank might want to fire
at a spacecraft. Incidentally, I wasn\'t referring to the design system, I
was referring to the combat system. So the "-25 size DM" is probably
irrelevant to any space combat discussions.

	And that\'s what most of the posts refererred to. Sensors in space can be
surprisingly accurate. Unless you not only handwave that Traveller ships
can get rid of lots of heat, but that they do so by magically making it
disappear. I can think about accepting "super radiators;" it\'s much harder
to accept "super heat vanishing devices."

	Unfortunately, most of my web site has missing links. I switched

I have to edit each one before reposting it. I\'m more than a bit behind,
and likely to remain that way for a while. If there\'s anything specific

the spacecraft. 

In an old supplement a friend of mine had it had detail on robotic mechanics
(like R2 in Star Wars on the x-wing) and a thing called an "eternity circuit"
that would repair the ship to original configuration given enough time and
raw material.  Pretty high TL if I remember like 15 and up.

As for the computer stuff there are a couple of other options that are common
in SF, especially semi-recent stuff.  Jacking-in through a direct connection
to your nervous system into your brain is one option.  This would be a VR
interface, Cyber doesn\'t have to be punk necessarily.
 Voice control is another.  I see a  Heechee (Frederick Pohl) concept with a
Virtual personality that can be holographically displayed, and interacted
with just like another person.  Perhaps programmed with a specific
personality of a famous person from history. 

 I think you are right on with the programming stuff though.  VR interface
would be the simplest way that I can think of unless you can envision a
holographic display and simply voice input for the programming.  That would
entail more of a language format rather than imagry (hard to pronounce images
unless you are a big fan of the artist formerly known as ...) but I guess you
could name the icons and make that into a language.  That might actually
work.  

Disregard my stream of consciousness.

I bet this was in unmodified BR, right?

BR was seriously broken (all tasks were on level too easy comopared
to BL).  Also, missile damage was way, way way out of whack.  If a
det-laser in BR did more than a damage of 3, something was wrong.
You draw a missile damage card in BR and get a 1 to 6, right?  Then
double it for Outstanding success.  A *single* missile in BR
(unfixed) can kill anything (and a det-laser missile, at that).
Also, since tasks are all one level too easy (look at the TNE to BR
task conversion chart near the end) getting Outstanding Success is a
cake walk.

Dune heavily informs my sense of pre-Civil War Imperial aesthetics.  Arbellatra\'s 
reforms included cleaning up the look of an Imperium that had grown decadent since 
Cleon\'s time.  These led eventually to the clean lines typified by the Keith brothers\' 
artwork.

You will need a pilot for a few reasons, the main reason is the type of
BB-killing missiles im thinking of are very short ranged.  Also, why waste
space for control mechnisms and engines and fuel to get the 50g
propulsion?  Fill that space with High Explosives.

The fighters.  A hit by the enemy BB is death (spinal).  The
fighters get killed off piecemeal, maybe do some damage here and
there before dying.

Explosives are a needless expense for most traveller missiles since
the closing velocity typical of such encounters means that the
kinetic energy of the missile exceeds any chemical energy you can
pack in.

Besides, if the fighter is close enough to drop this coasting
missile with any chance of hitting (assuming the target isn\'t
cojmpletely unaware of it being there) is has been dead for some
time already :-)

That\'s why a warship will have deployable decoys and drones that radiate
the proper frequencies, along with EM jamming, sand casting and everything
else you can come up with.  If they\'re good enough they\'ll be able to spoof
off some missiles.  You\'d probably communicate with them with narrow band
maser so they could be controlled and their ECM could be constantly
updated.  They\'d have to be powered to keep up with the ship and match her
maneuvers.  Expensive? You bet!

Ok now, do I have this right...

Using CSC, if you know you want to end up with an AV of 64 and you know
what material you\'ll be using, you just need to figure out the actual
thickness of the armor.  In CSC, Greg goes from cm to AV, but not from AV
to cm, so I *think* I have this conversion right.


Going from cm to AV you\'d do:  

    AV = (armor thickness in cm)^(1/3) * (Material Toughness)

Going from AV to cm you\'d rearrange the formula to be:

    (armor in cm) = (AV / (Material Toughness))^3

Your example:  AV = 64, 

Material Toughness = 11 (Superdense)

    armor = (64/11)^3 = 197cm

Material Toughness = 9 (Crystaliron)

    armor (64/9)^3 = 360cm


Isn\'t this right?

True, it was just a thought.  These missiles would be luanched AFTER a
barrage of Engine-seeking missile are - ie unless you do want to lose your
engines, then youd probably have them off, and youd be drifting...  


I was thinking along the lines of a combined arms attack.

Quite true.  I imagine space missiles fired from beyond their fuel range
would be programmed to boost to an intercept velocity on a projected
intercept course, go inert and coast in, then relight their thrusters for a
closing charge. This wouldn\'t always be possible, but having a few seconds
of maneuver at the target point could make the difference between a certain
miss and a possible hit.

Two questions:  

At what range does a Nuclear pumped x-ray laser head have to fire to have a
chance to hit?  Very short, within 30,000km..right?

Don\'t you suspect the lasers in the laser heads are non-grav
focused..*however* grav focusing is supposed to work?

Leonard, I think we pretty much agree, but you\'re missing, I think, my main
point. It wasn\'t g-load, it was TIME to turn.  I suspect you *know* all
that follows, but just in case I\'m visulizing it wrong...

Visualize the ship travelling straight forward, accelerating at 6g. If it
can thrust, instantaniously and directly in any direction (including
aft).., but lets say to port..then after one second it will have moved
forward by some distance that can be called 0-relative, and starboard by 30
meters.  This would be the *best* a ship could do on any heading.  The ship
would be somewhere in a spherical volume 60 meters in diameter (plus
whatever it\'s former vector and velocity was, but that\'s probably a *known*
value).  

However, most ships won\'t be able to apply 6g anywhere except along their
bow to stern "spine."  They will have to turn to apply thrust at some angle
to their previous vector.  The *time* it takes to turn will limit their
lateral displacement.  Let\'s say that the ship can turn 90 degrees in 1
second: This means if it turns away from its former heading under power for
the entire second it will have applied its acceleration along an arc from
its former heading to directly port or starboard (to stay in 2 dimensions
for the moment). The volume that the ship can be in is now *much* less than
60 meters in diameter, it would be shaped like a sector of a sphere...I
think. ;->

??Formula something like??

V= 1/6(pi)r^3  V = 1/6(3.1416)15^3 = 1767m

The 10m sphere has a volume of 524m, so you have a 30% prob of success on
any shot placed AT RANDOM, and a much better chance with a little
intellegent prediction of your target\'s future course.  

Or am I totally out in left field here?

There are always two ways to work out a probability problem.  The first is
to count the possible outcomes that meet your criterea, and divide by the
number of possible outcomes.  The second is to simplify the world by
splitting the problem into collections of probabilities that you like, and
then multiply those by the conditional chance of the event happening that
you want.

Using the first method:

Total possible rolls: 6*6*6*6 = 1296.
Rolls that have exactly three sixes:
1666 2666 3666 4666 5666
6166 6266 6366 6466 6566
6616 6626 6636 6646 6656
6661 6662 6663 6664 6665

And, of course, one way of getting four sixes: 6666.

Thus there is a 20/1296 chance of getting exactly three sixes, and a
21/1296 chance of getting three or four sixes.

The problem here is that this does not generalize well.  We now use the
second method, and hope that we get the same answer.  With luck, the second
method is easier to program into a computer or work out by hand for higher
numbers:

P(3 sixes, 4 dice) = P(d1=6)P(3 sixes given d1=6) + P(d1 != 6)P(3 sixes
given d1 != 6)

A mathematician would write this
P(3 sixes | 4 dice) = P(d1=6)P(3 sixes | d1=6) + P(d1 != 6)P(3 sixes | d1 != 6)

P(d1=6) = 1/6
P(d1 != 6) = 5/6

The chance of getting exactly two sixes on three dice is
	(5/6 * 1/6 * 1/6) + (1/6 * 5/6 * 1/6) + (1/6 * 1/6 * 5/6) = 15/216 ->
	P(3 sixes | d1=6) = P(2 sixes on 3 dice) = 15/216

The chance of getting exactly three sixes on three dice is 1/6 * 1/6 * 1/6,
or 1/216. ->
	P(3 sixes | d1 != 6) = P(all 3 dice are 6) = 1/216

thus

P(3 sixes | 4 dice) = 1/6 * 15/216 + 5/6 * 1/216
		= 15/1296 + 5/1296
		= 20/1296

Now, to get the chance of getting three or four sixes on four dice, use
P(3 or 4 sixes | 4 dice) = P(3 sixes | 4 dice) + P(4 sixes | 4 dice) =
	20/1296 + 1/1296 = 21/1296.

This generalizes fairly well.  Given the numbers above, you can break out
the chances for five dice either by counting (there are quire a few
options, so figure out a formula) or by using the numbers we just got and
the splitting rule (known as Baye\'s law) to express the chance of three
sixes on five dice in terms of the chances of getting fewer sixes on four
dice:

P(three sixes | five dice) = P(d1=6)*P(three sixes | d1 = 6) +
			+  P(d1 != 6)*P(three sixes | d1 != 6) +

Clearly, getting three sixes on five dice if the first one is a six is the
same as getting two sixes on four dice, as we know what the first one is.

The numebrs should fall out from there.

Yes, and here\'s one of the points at which "reasonable technological
speculation" runs headlong into "fun role-playing game," and there just
ain\'t no way \'round it.  The whole reason people are arguing so
passionately for fighters is that fighters are a cool thing for players to
sit in or shoot at.  No matter how you slice it, with Trav physics and
tech, drones/missiles are *infinitely* preferable to fighters -- but
there\'s no glory in having your character say "OK, I push the button that
launches a dozen drones at the enemy formation, attack pattern 2-C."
There *is* glory in shouting "Red Leader, I\'m going in!" as you aim your
nose at the Big Shiny Wedge of Doom, turbines screaming into the vacuum of
space. :)

As I\'ve pointed out before, Traveller is 1980ish sociology, politics,
economics, military science, and so forth, with a few key technologies
(fusion, Jump) layered on top, but *without* any real working out of the
wider effects of those technologies.  And that\'s *essential*, if players
are going to be able to drop into the game world without reading a dozen
doctoral theses on how things work in the 57th century.  Players need to
be able to assume that, usually, unless told otherwise, everything works
about the same as it would in present-day society -- a silly assumption in
terms of plausability, but *necessary for a game*!

The problem is that the illusion falls apart if you stare at it too hard.
We\'ve always had fighters in Traveller, but it\'s also always been the case
that they were silly in military terms.  They stayed part of the game
world because the 1980s had fighters, "Star Wars" had fighters, B5 had
fighters, and, damn it, players *like* fighters.  To quote Tom Servo, "It
just *is*!"

By the way, leaving rant mode and returning to the specific topic at hand,
the USN is *very* nervous about automated weapon systems -- more so after
the Vincennes incident, of course.  Their term for how human judgement
controls weapon systems is "Human In The Loop," or HITL.  So (for
example), your AEGIS system will track 75 airborne targets, discriminate
planes from cruise missiles from decoys, come up with a response mix for
your ship and the five nearby, allocate weapons accordingly, and put a
summary of all this on a console, all in a few seconds.  A box appears
with the equivalent of "OK?" on it, which the human selects if he agrees.
Then the AEGIS system automatically deploys all the weapons.  Kind of
scary, really, especially because the pressure to hit OK *now* (before
those cruise missiles get a few km closer) is a bit overwhelming, 

And for some systems, e.g. Phalanx, you *can\'t* have a human in the loop
- -- the required reaction time is just too short.  That makes the Navy
*very* nervous, which is one reason the Stark\'s stern Phalanx was in
standby mode the night that Exocet came visiting.

If your missiles are extremely short *ranged*, you could still use
them as submunitions in a larger missile.

Why waste all the space for fighters, fighter fuel, launch tubes,
pilots quarters, flight deck quarters, etc. back aboard the carrier
when you can make far better use filling up that space with missile
bays and magazines?

Using antimatter as a power source is totally different from using it as an
explosive. The hard part is storing antimatter safely and that is done
today in magnetic bottles at cryo temps. Just shut down the magnetic bottle
and KABOOM.

If you postulate cheap antimatter however I don\'t see why you need a
fighter to deploy it. Due to G-comp limits and human limits on Gs to take
the fighter that depolys the 1000 G 300 s missile would be analogous to
infantrymen on foot launching cruise missiles. So what I\'m saying is your
1000 G missile won\'t make the fighters useful as BB killers as the BBs
themselves kan shoot the same missiles.

was able to iron out the spectacular success/fail rules for use with 
KBv2.0 tonight.

This was the last thing that needed to be developed and bugged, and 
now KBv2.0 is ready for play.

Yeah, I know, some of you are already using KBv2.0 in your games, and 
I thank all of you for all of the private words of encouragement you 
have sent me regarding this task system.  With this post, we\'ve now 
got a SS/SF system, and the whole task system is now complete.

Here\'s what I\'ve come up with for rolling SS and SF, and here\'s 
the KBv2.0 difficutly codes for easy reference.

		Easy				Auto/2D
		Average				3D
		Difficult				4D
		Formidable			5D
		Staggering			6D
		Impossible			7D

- ----



On with the SS/SF rules.  I\'ll compare the thinking behind the KBv2.0 
rules to Marc Miller\'s new T4 task fix that he has indicated (to the 
list with a post and by printing it on the new T4 GM screen) he will 
include in the new revised edition of T4.

Let\'s take SF first.

Marc is using 3 sixes for SF in his new task system for T4 (any time 
3 sixes pop up in a task roll, you\'ve got a spectacular failure on 
your hands).  

It\'s a logical step from the 2 sixes rule from the original (and 
still current) T4 SF rule.  The problem with Marc using 3 sixes is 
that, under his system, you cannot roll SF with Easy, Average, or 
even Difficult task rolls (under Marc\'s "improved" T4 system, Easy is 
1D, Average is 2D, and Difficult is 2.5D).

I have a problem with this in that you can only royally screw up with 
Formidable and harder tasks.  I can understand the Easy category 
being exempt from SF (it is in the current T4 rules too), because 
those tasks are just about automatic, and there\'s no chance of a 
royal blunder.

But Average and Difficult task throws are exempt too?  I\'ve got a 
real problem with that.

With John\'s probability help, I calculated the percentage of rolling 
3 sixes under the KBv2.0 difficulty codes, and I like what I see. 

So much so, in fact, that I am adopting them as the official SF rule 
for the KBv2.0 task system.   In KBv2.0, SF is not possible with Easy 
tasks, but every other difficulty category is fair game.  Here\'s the 
numbers.



SPECTACULAR FAILURE RULE FOR KBv2.0:

Anytime 3 sixes are rolled for a task attempt, a spectacular failure 
has occured.  On Easy task throws, SF is not possible.  The harder a 
task becomes, the more likely SF will be rolled.

Difficulty				%SF
- ----			----
Easy				0
Average				0.46
Difficult				1.54
Formidable			3.22
Staggering			5.36
Impossible			7.81



OK, let\'s discuss SS.  First, I\'ll talk about what I think is wrong 
with Marc\'s SS in his new T4 task fix, then I\'ll explain why I think 
the SS system I\'ve chosen for KBv2.0 is much better.

In Marc\'s new T4 task system, anytime 3 ones are rolled, a SS has 
occurred.  I find three things wrong with this.

First, like with the SF system Marc is using, SS can only occurr on 
Difficult or harder task throws.  I don\'t agree with that.  If a task 
is Easy or Average (meaning that they are easier to accomplish than 
Difficult throws), the percentage to roll SS is 0.00%

It doesn\'t make sense to me that you can\'t do spectaculary well on an 
Easy or Average task, but you can do it on Difficult and harder 
tasks.

My second problem with Marc\'s system is akin to this first one.  
Since we are rolling more dice the harder the difficulty (not only 
is SS available only on more difficult task throws, but....),  the 
probability of rolling SS actually GOES UP the harder a task gets.

This seem ass-backwards to me.  It should be easier to roll SS at the 
less difficult categories and harder to roll it in the more difficult 
categories.

As Marc has it now, the percentage to roll SS using his T4 "fixed" 
task system is this:

	Marc\'s T4 Difficulty Codes			%SS
	----			----
	Easy							0.00
	Average							0.00
	Difficult							0.93
	Formidable						0.46
	Staggering						1.54
	Impossible						3.22

That little screwy drop then raise between Difficult and Staggering 
is because of the inclusion of the half die in Marc\'s system--when 
you are only rolling a D3 instead of a whole die, that one pops up 
much more.

As you can see, though, under Marc\'s SS rule, the chance of rolling 
a SS is less than 1% if you are rolling a Difficult task, but the 
chance is 3 times as much if you are rolling an Impossible task.

This makes no sense to me.

Thirdly,  I think that a SS rule should work in the opposite 
direction.  One of the genius things about the original T4 task 
system was that the probability of SF went up the harder a task got 
and the probability of SS went down as the throw got harder.

That makes perfect sense to me.  It should be easier to roll SS on 
an Easy task than on an Impossible task, and it should be harder to 
roll SF on an Average task rather than a Staggering task.  The 
original T4 system (I know it had other problems) worked this 
beautifully with its 2 sixes rule for SF and its all ones rule for 
SS.  Marc\'s change in this rule, under his new system, has screwed 
up this beautiful relationship for SS and SF.

How am I going to fix that in KBv2.0?

"Well, I\'ll tell ya, pardner," as the Duke used to say.

There are two things governing my thought process as I developed 
this SS rule for KBv2.0.  One is that, as I just stated above, I 
want KBv2.0\'s SS system to:  1)  be obtainable on Easy throws, and   
2) be harder to obtain with higher difficulty.

The second governing thought is that I like the idea of SS being 
tied to skill level.  It is logical to me that the more skilled you 
are in a particular area, the easier it should be for you to do 
really well at it.

Given this, here\'s the SS rule for KBv2.0.



SPECTACULAR SUCCESS RULE FOR KBv2.0:

In order to roll a spectacular success, you have to roll the SS 
target number or less when rolling a task.  

SS target number = Skill Level + Dice Code

Task Roll Example with all possible outcomes:
- ----
For example, a character with a Stat-7 and a Skill-2, rolling a 
Difficult task, would roll 4 D6 (Difficult tasks require 4D to be 
rolled).  If a 13 or less is rolled (KBv2.0 target number for regular 
success ={(3 x Skill) + Stat}, then the roll is a success.  If 14 
or more is rolled, the task attempt fails.  If 3 (or 4) of the 4 dice 
show sixes, then the task attempt results in spectacular failure.  
And, if 6 or less is rolled (SS target number = Skill Level + Dice 
Code), the task attempt results in a spectacular success.

In this manner, characters with higher skill levels will have better 
chances of achieving SS.  Also, using this method, the chance of 
achieving SS will go down the harder a task becomes.

Note that characters attempting a task with a Default skill can still 
roll SS, but it is a difficult proposition.  They have to roll all 
ones on the throw to achieve SS, and given the amount of dice thrown, 
the chances are that this is not very likely (but this accounts for 
those blind strokes of luck).



Since this SS system is dependent on a character\'s skill, one table 
of percentages showing the SS chance of success does not apply.  For 
comparison\'s sake, though, here\'s a table to show you what an average 
character\'s (Skill-2, Stat-7) chance of rolling SS would be.

Character has a Skill-2;  his chance of SS would be:

Difficulty			%SS
- ----			----
Easy			16.67
Average			4.63
Difficult			1.16
Formidable		0.27
Staggering		0.06
Impossible		0.01



And, let\'s go ahead and look at a character with a skill specialty.

Character has Skill-5;  his chance of SS would be:

Difficulty			%SS
- ----			----
Easy			58.33
Average			25.93
Difficult			9.72
Formidable		3.24
Staggering		0.99
Impossible		0.28



So, what do you think of my SS/SF system for KBv2.0?

I think it is exactly what the doctor ordered for the twice sick 
(original and Marc\'s fix) T4 task system.

Let me know.

That is right.  I\'ve been trying to use the CSC codes to come up with 
T4 armor values for the TNE/MT/CT armors that are not printed in the 
T4 books.

I\'m having a tough time of it, though.  The CSC was written for

I\'ll keep trying.  I need T4 armor values for my circa 1105 armor

You thinking on this matter may help me too.  I\'ll try to plug in the 
values backwards as you have suggested.  Maybe I\'ll come up with 
something.  The true test is to backwards work some T4 armor and 
compare the AV I get with the true T4 AV printed in the book.

Shurely v2.1? ;-)

[Needs p(3 sixes) for nD, n>= 3]

This is given by p(arrangement contains 3 sixes) * no. of such 
arrangements.

p(3) = p(6)^3 * p(not 6)^(n-3) * [n! / ( (n-3)! 3!)]

where a! is used for a factorial = 1 * 2 * ... * a and a^b is a to 
the power b.

Hence p(3) = (1/6)^3 * (5/6)^(n-3) * n * n-1 * n-2 / 6
           = (1 * 5^(n-3) * n(n-1)(n-2)) / 6^(n+1)

This gives the probability of 3 and only 3 sixes.
The easiest way to get p(3 or more sixes) is to find
p(0), p(1) and p(2). Since the sum of all probabilities = 1,
p(3+) = 1 - (p(0) + p(1) + p(2))

p(0) = (5/6)^n
p(1) = n (1/6) (5/6)^(n-1)
p(2) = 1/2 n(n-1) (1/6)^2 (5/6)^(n-2)

This can be used to rewrite p(3+) as

p(3+) = 1 - (5^n + n * 5^(n-1) + 1/2 *n(n-1) * 5^(n-2))/6^n

Hence, using these formulae:

Dice  P(3 only)  P(3+)

3D    0.0046     0.0046
4D    0.0154     0.0162
5D    0.0322     0.0355
6D    0.0536     0.0623
7D    0.0781     0.0958

*very* roughly, spectacular failure on 5D is equivalent to 1/36 
(double 6 on 2D), on 6D 2/26 (roll 11 on 2D) and on 7D 3/36 (roll 11+ 
on 2D).

Which sounds good to me...

Keep up the good work with KBv2.x

Actually if CT Robots is considered canon there could be neutrino sensors a
few kilos in mass but I\'m not shure about range. The text says something
like "detects nearby powerplants". Come to think of it wasn\'t there
neutrino sensors for missiles in the Journal Missiles supplement?

However in my Traveller campaign neutrino sensors are pretty large and
requires a license to own as they would make tracking of SDB movements way
too easy if Joe Public Xho-spy could own one. The same goes for
massdetectors. May players had to come up with some ingenious reasons why
they need a mass detector as they actually will use it to search for
Ancient portals in gas giants. The portals give away large gravity waves
when something enters/exits them.

Me and Daniel had some ideas about large gravity wave detectors for
detecting incoming outgoing ships. Any ship coming in from hyperspace or
jumping would create a huge gravity wave detectable in an entire solar
system. You\'d need several to get the location but then you\'d know where
they exited/entered jumpspace. The problem is that at those ranges you\'d
probably would have a hard time tracking them by other sensors so all you
know is that someone was at a specific location at a specific time.

This could be an excellent handwave for why space fleets cannot pass each
other by in a system despite there being so many refuelling options in a
solar system. Due to comsinc events such as suns crashing into one another,
large chunks of matter colliding with black holes et c in the Universe
there could be gravitywave storms sweeping through the systems at certain
time and if the source lay beyond Zhodani space they\'d know about it before
the Imperials and time their injumps to the oncoming of the wavefront.

Bad idea, cool idea or what?

Well, when I came up with the entire BARD concept, I meant it to be a TNS
for the RefCol.  I guess in one way, the TNS would be responsible for the
info, and in another the IISS would be.  For a planetary write-up, I\'d use...

			designed by Kenneth D. Bearden



I might be being a little bold here, but I\'ve spent months working on 
this task system.  I\'ve gotta say that I\'m quite proud of it, and as 
of tonight, the KBv2.0 task system is complete.

There\'s a lot of information here, but don\'t let that skew your 
opinion of KBv2.0.  It is a very simple system.  I\'ve written a lot 
here in an effort to be complete.  Give the whole system a 
read-through, and you\'ll see what I mean when I say that this system 
is as simple as the official T4 systems but it doesn\'t have the 
problems associated with those systems.

Here\'s what you have to do to start using KBv2.0

          1)  Change the difficulty codes
          2)  Change the way you calculate target numbers
          3)  Incorporate changes to SS/SF, multiple actions, Default 
               skill throws, and JOT skill throws.

It\'s as easy as that.

What will this task system do for you?

Here\'s ten promises that I will make:

1)  It will keep the flavour and general design philosophy of the 
official T4 task system (both of them--the original T4 system in Book 
1 and Marc\'s new fix).  In other words, KBv2.0 is designed 
mechanically like the T4 systems (simple and functional)  but cures 
all the ills of both the T4 systems.  

2)  It will allow you to only use whole dice.  This means that the 
awkward D3s used in both Marc\'s and Book 1\'s T4 task systems are a 
thing of the past.

3)  It will place a greater emphasis on skills so that your Pilot-4, 
Dex-6 character will be able to capitalize on his greater skill level 
when pitted against the Pilot-1 but Dex-10 rookie.  Both the Book 1 
system and Marc\'s new variant do not have this capability.

4)  It will ensure that this greater emphasis that is put on skills 
will not overpower the effect that natural ability has on a task 
roll.  This means that having a high stat is still a very, very good 
thing.

5)  It will deliver relevant probabilities of success based on a 
character\'s skills and attributes.  What this means is that certain 
difficulty categories won\'t get out of hand like the Staggering and 
Impossible categories did in the Book 1 version of the T4 task 
system.

6)  Spectacular Success will be possible at every difficulty level.  
The chance of SS will be based on a character\'s skill, and 
characters with higher skill levels will have an increased chance of 
SS than characters with skill levels lower than theirs.  Also the 
chance that SS will be obtained will decrease the harder a task 
becomes.

Although the Book 1 T4 SS system also decreases the chance of SS with 
each increase in difficulty and provides for SS at every difficulty 
level, that system has no provision for higher skilled characters 
receiving a better chance of obtaining SS.

Marc\'s T4 task fix only allows SS on Difficult and higher difficulty 
categories, and the percentage that SS is rolled actually goes up 
with higher task difficulties.  That system also has no provision for 
increased SS percentage based on a character\'s skill level.

7)  Spectacular Failure will be rolled just like Marc Miller\'s system 
(which is a logical extension of the SF system used in Book 1), but 
SF in KBv2.0 can occur at any difficulty category except Easy.

In Marc\'s system, SF can only occur in Formidable and higher 
categories--leaving no chance for SF in Average and Difficult throws.

8)  There will be no awkward math used that will slow down game play. 
 Like the attribute + skill system used in both Marc\'s and Book 1\'s 
task systems, KBv2.0 will only require simple addition of two numbers 
to arrive at target numbers during game play.  This allows for quick 
calculation after a character has been wounded and had his stat 
reduced.

9)  It will require little or no conversion for published T4 
products, and it is fully compatible with all T4 rules, game 
mechanics, and design systems.  This is a variant task system, but it 
replaces the two old task systems with a minimum of fuss--you won\'t 
have to spend hours on each adventure and supplement converting 
things to a new way of rolling tasks.

10)  It is the best Traveller task system available for T4.


=================================================================
And now, on to the task system.  All official rules are included 
below.  Using KBv2.0 involves 7 easy steps.
=================================================================


STEP 1:  Change the Difficulty Codes.......

DIFFICULTY CODES

KBv2.0 uses these difficulty codes.  Simply change these on page 50 
of Book 1 and on your T4 GM Screen.

Task Difficulties

Rating                              Dice Code
- ----                             ----
Easy                                Auto/2D*
Average                          3D
Difficult                            4D
Formidable                       5D
Staggering                       6D
Impossible                        7D

*It is suggested that Easy tasks are rolled, especially if the task 
roll includes use of a Default skill.  At the GM\'s option, Easy task 
rolls can be considered automatic successes.



STEP 2:  Change Target Number Calculation.......

TARGET NUMBERS

Both the T4 systems (Marc\'s and the original one in Book 1) add 
attribute + skill to arrive at a target number.  What this does is 
make attributes much more important than skills in the game.

Take, for example, a character with Pilot-4 (an expert pilot) and a 
Dex-6 (a respectable stat--about average).  His target number would 
be 10.  Now compare this to another character with Pilot-1 (a 
definite beginner) and Dex-10 (some definite natural ability).  This 
second character would have a target number of 11 affording him a 
better chance of success at piloting than the expert.  What this type 
of target number calculation is saying is that the second character\'s 
natural ability is so great that, even though he just learned to fly, 
his natural instincts and ability make him a better pilot than the 
expert with only average natural ability.

The KBv2.0 system fixes this inequity by increasing the value of a 
character\'s skill with regard to the target number.

EXPERIENCE SCORE

The first step in using KBv2.0 target numbers is to calculate a 
character\'s experience score.  To do this, simply multiply the skill 
levels for each of a character\'s skills by 3.  

Experience Score = Skill Level x 3

Record each experience score next to each of a character\'s skills on 
his sheet.  It is suggested that this information be recorded in 
parentheses next to the skill\'s governing attribute.

In game play, you will add the character\'s experience score to his 
governing attribute to arrive at the target number for the task 
throw.  Instead of just adding attribute + skill, like in the two 
official T4 systems, you add attribute + experience to find the 
character\'s target number.

Target Number = Attribute + Experience

A character\'s experience score will never change except when his 
skill level is improved.  When this happens, simply record the new 
experience score for that skill.

On the other hand, a character\'s attribute may be adjusted due to 
combat wounds or some other factor during game play.  This will alter 
the character\'s target number--just like in both the other T4 task 
systems.



Step 1 and 2 are the basis for KBv2.0.  If you\'ve read this far, then 
you already know the system.  The following steps change some of the 
aspects and game mechanics associated with the T4 task system.

For general information, here is a list of all possible target 
numbers and their chance of success within each difficulty.  These 
numbers have been rounded, so you may see 100% listed more than 
once.  This chart is provided for GMs and players to aid in 
gauging task probability.  Keep in mind that these numbers are not 
adjusted for either SF or SS.  For instance, an 18 rolled on an 
Average throw would result in a SF, even though the table says it is 
a 100% chance of success, but 18 rolled on 3 dice can only occur 
with 3 sixes (which indicates a SF).

STEP 3:  Change the rule for Spectacular Failure.......

SPECTACULAR FAILURE

Any time 3 sixes are rolled for a task, a spectacular failure has 
occurred.  SF is not possible on Easy task rolls, but can occur on 
any of the other difficulty levels.

SF = Any time 3 sixes are rolled

For completeness, here\'s a table which lists the probability that SF 
will occur given the difficulty of the task.

Probability of SF

Difficulty                    SF%
- ----
Easy                          0.00
Average                    0.46
Difficult                      1.54
Formidable                 3.22
Staggering                 5.36
Impossible                  7.81



STEP 4:  Change the rule for Spectacular Success.......

SPECTACULAR SUCCESS

Spectacular success is gauged by a character\'s skill in the 
appropriate area.  A SS occurs if the SS target number, or less, is 
thrown.

SS Target Number = Skill Level + Difficulty Dice Code

SS can occur in any difficulty level or when Default skills are 
being used.  Since Default skills have a level of 0, the SS target 
number for these throws is just the difficulty dice code (which is 
equivalent to rolling all ones on the task throw).  The percentage of 
this happening is so low that it will almost never happen, but this 
does leave that one in a million chance that a character will blunder 
into a SS.

Here\'s a couple of tables to put SS into perspective.  The first 
states the percentage chances that a SS will be rolled if a Default 
skill is being used.  The second, since SS is dependent on a 
character\'s skill level, will state the chance an average character 
(defined as Skill-2, Stat-7) will have at achieving SS for each 
particular difficulty level.

Probability of SS with a Default skill

Difficulty                   SS%
- ----
Easy                         2.78
Average                   0.46
Difficult                     0.08
Formidable                0.01
Staggering                0.00*
Impossible                 0.00*

*The percentage chance is actually greater than 0, but due to 
rounding, the percentage could not be expressed in less than three 
digits.



Probability of SS for an average character
(average character defined as Skill-2, Stat-7)

Difficulty                    SS%          SS TN
- ----
Easy                          16.67         4
Average                    4.63           5
Difficult                      1.16           6
Formidable                 0.27           7
Staggering                 0.06           8
Impossible                  0.01           9



Now that we know how to roll a task and gauge SS/SF, let\'s look at an 
example that explains each of the topics above.

TASK ROLL EXAMPLE

Joe Average makes a Difficult throw--he throws 4 D6.  He\'s got 
Skill-2 and Stat-7, so his target number is 13.  If the result of the 
throw is 13 or below, Joe succeeds.  If the roll is 14 or above, Joe 
fails.  If 3 sixes are rolled on any of the 4 dice (or even 4 sixes), 
then Joe has just thrown a spectacular failure.  Since Joe\'s SS 
target number is 6 (skill + dice code), he will achieve spectacular 
success if the result of the throw is 6 or less.

And that\'s it--one dice throw, four different outcomes.



STEP 5:  Change the Multiple Action rule.......

MULTIPLE ACTIONS

On page 58 of Book 1, there is a rule for multiple actions during the 
combat round that must be changed for KBv2.0.  Actually, the KBv2.0 
rule is more simple than the original rule published in Book 1.

When a character attempts to conduct multiple actions in a round, 
calculate the target number normally, but divide the target number by 
the number of actions attempted during the round.

Multiple Action Rule = Divide TN by number of actions attempted

So, if a player wants his character to fire his weapon three 
times in a combat round, simply calculate the TN normally then divide 
it by 3 to arrive at the new TN used for all three shots.

If the character is attempting multiple actions that are not the 
same, then use the lowest TN from the actions being attempted, 
and divide from there.  It is advised that the GM keep a handle on 
this to ensure that characters don\'t attempt multiple actions that 
would take them more than 6 seconds to accomplish.  

Optional Rule/Recommendation--
The action point rules in CT\'s Snapshot or Azhanti High Lightning 
could be used to figure how many actions a character is physically 
able to attempt in a single combat round.  This could be used to 
combat abuse of the multiple action rule.



STEP 6:  Change the Default task throw rule.......

DEFAULT SKILL THROWS

On page 49 of Book 1 it states that the attribute must be halved 
before calculating the target number for a task throw using a 
Default skill.  This is not necessary in KBv2.0.  Simply use the full 
characteristic as the target number (the skill level, of course, is 0 
and does not contribute to the target number in this instance).



STEP 7:  Change the Jack of All Trades rule.......

JOT RULE

On page 44 of Book 1, it states that, when using JOT skill, the 
character must halve his attribute before calculating the target 
number.  This is not necessary in KBv2.0.

To use JOT skill with KBv2.0, simply add the JOT skill level to the 
attribute, and use that as the target number.  

JOT TN = JOT Skill + Attribute

Notice that JOT receives a penalty because the skill level is not 
multiplied by 3, yet the skill will provide a benefit over a Default 
skill.



And, that is it--the whole task system in 7 steps.

Ok, wait.  This is *science fiction*.  If you can\'t think of a few
different ways to block, confuse, or otherwise "jam" IR sensors go play
Harpoon instead.  Likewise if you cannot possibly imagine that there is
some method which you can\'t think up which might not violate the laws of
physics, you need an imagination boost...go to disneyworld.

To prevent an IR sensor from operating properly I can think of three
strategies;  Deception, Concealment, and Overload.

Deception is like TL8 IR flares.  When jamming IR sensors a drone or three
are launched which radiate in the same spectrum as the launching vessel.

Concealment is harder, but if all heat energy in the direction
of the detecting ship is eliminated, that still leaves the directions
*away* from the detecting ship for radiating heat.  With no medium
around the emitting ship, only the IR radiation in the exact
direction of the detecting ship can be picked up.  In addition,
total elimination (an unlikely prospect) is probably not needed since even
a really good IR sensor will have a minimum threshhold which decreases as
an inverse square of the distance, or something like that.         

Problem with that strategy is that the jamming ship needs to know at least
vaguely what direction the detecting ship lies in.  I already assume that
the target ship knows someone is "out there" since otherwise why would
they be jamming?

The target ship could also use some sort of heat absoring material (like
chillcans in battle dress) to avert emmissions for a time.  I would think
this requires a lot of space, and you don\'t want to keep all that heat in
for long.

Overload is definitely harder to accomplish.  You could aim an IR burning
laser in the direction of the detecting ship, but if you could do that why
not use a real laser?  Radiating all your heat in the direction of the
sensor would probably just make you easier to detect, since the amount of
energy you\'d need to radiate would be more than what\'s available...but
then again maybe there\'s something Idon\'t know about high tech IR sensors.
Maybe to be sensitive enough to pick up one little starship against the
backdrop of all the stars in the night sky the sensor needs to be really
sensitive; so sensitive it can be jammed with a bit of extra IR in
about the right direction, or maybe there\'s a way to "refract" or "fuzz"
the return so that the precise location of the IR source is impossible to
determine.

I think the sensors in Traveller (I\'m thinking MT here) are purposefully
vaguely described because 1) the designers realized that not everyone is
the tech head that we are and 2) that way you can come up wiith your own
rationale.  Any theoretical development can be filled with holes.  The
idea is to find one where the holes are relatively pluggable.

Stacking compensators is an OPTIONAL rule.  Being an optional rule I don\'t
think that it should be used when design ships or vehicles for the common
Traveller Universe.  Very much like FF&S gave us Alternate Technologies.  Of
course if you do use the stacking rule I don\'t see any reason you can\'t use
them on Space Battleships.  I mean, it should be just as easy to install
stacked compensator for the crew positions on a Space Battleship as it is for
a Space Fighter.

Leonard, you\'re making (what I think is) a big mistake here. You\'re taking
it for granted that the Traveller Universe works the same way the real 
universe works. Let me let you in on a secret. It dosen\'t. Just to give
you an example, detection ranges dosen\'t match. You\'re doing things
exactly backwards. You\'re trying to make a game be as realistic as 
possible and damn the playability. A game should be as playable as 
possible and... well, no, not damn the realism, because in a role-playing
game realism is quite important. Just not as important as playability.
But what makes a game universe "realistic" isn\'t realism, it\'s consistency.
That\'s where realism has an edge, because if you keep things realistic
you get consistency thrown in for free. And that\'s usually a good thing,
but not always. Not when the realism impairs the playability.

Instead of saying that this or that game rule is unrealistic you should
first decide whether it is a good rule (and I have to weasel a bit here,
because I haven\'t worked much with space combat, so I don\'t know if the
detection rules in Traveller are good or not (heck, I don\'t even know
exactly _what_ the rules are in T4); however for purposes of this argument
I\'m going to assume that they work fine in a game context. If that is the
case, then what you need to do is to make up some new laws of physics that
makes them possible.

Here\'s one possiblilty: You say that there are no heat sinks in space. How
do you know? In Traveller you have at least 36 parrallel dimensions (the
36 jump-spaces) and quite possibly more. Perhaps a "sub-space" that
thurusters "thrust" against. Or define a subspace that has no other
practical function than being a heat sink for ships that want to hide in
empty space.

Or why NOT repeal the laws of physics in certain carefully defined
circumstances? Create a "stealth field", if you like. The real universe
isn\'t going to mind. 

The problem is to make sure your new laws dosen\'t have undesired 
ramifications. Take the heat sink idea, for example. Postulate the
availability of a heat sink inside a starship and no other changes in
the laws of physics. Would that allow other, undesirable, effects?
(Like drawing power out of thin air).

(You know, if such a heat sink was an expensive dingus it would be a
perfect solution to the civilian vs. military ship cost problem).

You know that and I know that, but _Referee\'s Companion_ put surgery at

But my point is that once you know about the desirability of sterile
procedures you don\'t need to depend on the serendipituos sterility of
freshly sharpened flint knife. You can implement it your very own
self at a much lower TL than you need to _discover_ germs.

But if you know the principles you can work out the details. The Darrians
had the principles and they had 13 centuries to work out the details 
(assuming they began when Mire reached TL 9) and they still didn\'t have 
them in 1100. To me that is a lot more incredible than stealth fields.

No, if they don\'t have the details in 1100 then it\'s because they lost
the principles too.

The problem isn\'t that they lost their technology. That\'s plausible
enough. The problem is that they lost their knowledge although one huge
repository of knowledge survived _intact_.

I belive that the principles alone would be enough to let people rediscover
the details, especially in about twice the time it took them to discover both 
principles and details in the first place. If you don\'t think so then we\'ll 
just have to agree to disagree.

This reminds me of a "low tech vs high tech" idea I had the other day.
I\'d just finished re-reading Footfall (Niven & Pournelle), and I got to
thinking that similar confrontations had to happen *sometime during the
Long Night or the early spread of the Imperium. 

And I got to wondering if it\'d be possible to design the Micheal using
Trav rules. That would shock some players.... Nuclear putt-putt
propulsion, gamma ray lasers, 15 inch naval cannon, and anything else a
TL8/TL/9 civilization could scrape together.

I\'m starting a database of Traveller "geography", sectors, subsectors,
stars, planets...

Anyway, I just finished entering what I could find in Alien Module 1
(Aslan). On page 2 Kusyu is listed as 0408, on page 35 it\'s listed as
0305 in one paragraph, and 0309 in the next! For what it\'s worth, Atlas
of the Imperium shows 0309. :-)

So never trust data that you haven\'t cross checked. :-)

ps, for anyone who cares, I put all three locations in the database.

Something to notice, the missile doesn\'t actually need to expend fuel until
the terminal phase of the flight. It only needs the fuel to correct for aim
and to get a final burst of speed near the end of the flight.

Initially, the missile would have the heading and velocity of the launching
platform, much like a tossed bomb. NOTE this will work only on a platform
capable of high speed runs, so not likely any capital ships using this tactic.
If an initial burst of speed is needed (like for launching from a capital
ship), a first stage or a short fuel burn can be included to give that
boost, adding to the initial velocity.

Make that a fraction of the wavelength the sensor array senses. And if
you lik the fighters with tight beam lasercomm, the cesium clock module
(or equivalent) on the fighters will let the computers do the rest.

I figure that be TL 12 you ought to be able to afford that kind of
timing accuracy for lots of things where it\'d be useful.

The ISS will be willing to perchase a number of medium to long range

passenger and a small cargo (life support and medical supplies).

The intent is to use these as a first response in the case of ships

supply life support or medical aid as needed while slower vessels are
still one the way.

I got to thinking and realized that there are jobs for a small, fast
ship *besides* scouting and shooting holes in things. Think of these as
being something like the "motor lifeboats" that the US Coast Guard
uses. You can base them places you can\'t base a larger ship, they are
cheap enough that you can have a lot more of them, and they can be
there giving aid while larger ships are still running down checklists. 

So, I\'d like the THUDD designers to consider a "search and rescue"
variant of their designs as part of the competition. If the THUDD folks
aren\'t willing, then how about someone designing one anyway?

Well, the potential energy depends on more than *just* the acceleration
provided by the field. In a normal gravity field, potential energy is
escape velocity * mass. And as you can see with some simple
calculations, you can get wildly different values for different density
spheres.

If I could find the formula for the gravity at the center of a flat
disk, I\'d be able to give a better answer, but I\'d say that the
potential energy is equivalent to the velocity you\'d get falling from
the ceiling to the floor (since the field is apparently confined to the
*inside* of the ship). 

And if you are jumping from one ship to another, you only need to worry
about the difference in field settings. Jumping from a ship to a
*planet* is another matter. Ditto for the reverse. Jumping to the
planet, the result should be the same as if the guy *fell* from that
height. (Ouch!) Jumping *from* the planet would require more energy
than the guy has.

Mainframes don\'t necessarily give any better security than networking a
bunch of smaller systems and restricting what you are allowed to see on
other systems.

I agree that mainframes will always be there. Mainframes differ from
minis and micros not in speed, but in raw storage, and in I/O capacity.

Rough rule of thumb right now: Micros have as much RAM/diskspace as
minis did 5 years ago or mainframes ten years ago. 

So in Traveller terms, I\'d have storage & RAM be 1 TL *ahead* for
mainframes, and one *behind* for micros. The computers on ships are
basicly minis.

I/O is a different matter. That doesn\'t really change. Micros are "few"
users, usually 1-10, with 100 being unusual. Minis are 100 is normal,
10,000 is unusual. Mainframes are anything up from there. There are
*current* systems (such as some of the credit card approval systems),
that are handling hundreds of thousands of transactions. 

Mainframes also tend to go for the huge data crunching stuff. For
example, the IRS has a batch job that takes 3 *weeks*. It\'s processing
amounts of data that boggle the mind. It\'s written in *optimized
assembler* just to get the run time down that far. And you don\'t even
want to *think* about the data storage it needs.

Imagine what the Imperial tax people have to crunch through!

Well, not exactly. My design for a 20mm single shot sniper rifle does 8D

I wrote up this history of the Vemene in the New Era. The gist of the
write up is that one group of Vemene gets stranded and turns into a
criminal organization on Oriflamme. 

For those of you in Year Zero you could easily change this into Miliue
0, by just changing the names around and making the Vemene come from a
pocket empire.

For those in year 1200, but not in the RC, you could just change the
planet which the Vemene gets stranded on.

So tell me what you think, Did I forget any canon, Is this specific
enough, or is it too vague?
Lewis


Vemene
    After the Solomani annexed the majority of the Old Expanses, Margaret
decided that she needed information on Solomani moves in the sector.  The
Vemene, the intelligence service of Tukera Lines which Margaret used as
her main intelligence source, dispatched teams to strategic worlds. 
These included high population worlds and those with important military or
industrial installations.  Nemyer (the future Oriflamme) was one of
these, both for its population and the Xboat Way station in the outer 
system.  									  
    By 1121 the team was in place, they managed to infiltrate the
Scout base and over time they discovered many important secrets. As
Hard Times set in and as Margret\'s forces withdrew in to her shrinking
safe area funds for intelligence operations started to dry up.  The
Vemene team were forced to create some of their own operating funds.
They had previous contacts with the underworld, they decided to expand
these contacts.  They slowly moved into the criminal arena, selling
the occasional bit of information to the mob.  After a while they had
learned enough about the structure of the underworld, they allied 
themselves with one criminal group and launched a hostile takeover against
another group.  This takeover was much more subtle than the usual 
mob war. The Vemene assassinated key figures and framed others for the
deeds, informed on their enemies to the police, blackmailed political
figures to put pressure on their enemies and other techniques.  After a
year or two of this, they had managed to control one of the top three
criminal organizations in the capital, of Weinburg.  They figured that
these criminal acts served two purposes, one they earned money to fund
their intelligence gathering operations, and whatever harm was being
done to people, was being done to the Solomani.  
    When the criminal activity first started it was only a small part
of their total operation, as time went on it grew in importance.
By 1132 the Vemene controlled one of the top criminal organizations on
the planet.  Their group was involved with extortion, drugs, 
murder for hire, and they took a cut off every criminal act
that took place in the territory the controlled.  Their 
intelligence gathering had suffered; several of their agents 
had been arrested or killed because of their criminal
actions, but the members were richer than they had ever been. 
With the Rim Concordant signed between Magaret and the Solomani, there
was less of a demand for intelligence.
    When Virus hit Nemyer in 1133, the planet\'s robotic agriculture
were destroyed.  The Vemene took advantage of the chaos by seizing 
farms and selling what little produce there was at inflated prices.
It wasn\'t only luck that allowed the Vemene to survive while most of
their competitors died in the chaos.  If they weren\'t killed directly,
their organizations were disrupted and the Vemene took advantage of
this and eliminated them.  
    In the refugee camps that existed after the Collapse, the Vemene
set up protection rackets and a blackmarket.  They also continued to
control several farms and food processing plants.  As life slowly
recovered they had even more power than they had ever had  before the collapse.
    By 1200 the Vemene is the largest criminal organization on Nemyer
which has now been renamed Oriflamme. It has several thousand thugs
under its control.  Its influence is felt in most feudal holdings.  Three
of the farms that they took control of during the Food Riots, have turned
into legitimate feudal holdings, in these holdings the Vemene are the 
government.  They are Holgren, Andropov and Kircheff Holdings. These
holdings are extremely small, the only thing making them noteworthy is
that they are run by the Vemene. They each contain about a quarter of a
million residents.  They are all still primarily agricultural holdings,
with large grain farms in the northern reaches of the planet. Holgren
Hold has expanded into the manufacture of high speed aircraft, and has
recently won a contract to build Oriflamme\'s new interface fighter
plane, the Tempest.  Andropov Hold owns one of the finest research labs
on the planet, often coming to a market with a new device, bare weeks
before competitor was due to come out with a similar product. 
Accusations that Andropov Labs engaged in industrial espionage, are met
with lawsuits and threats of war.  
    It is an open secret that these holdings were taken over by the
Vemene during the collapse. It is a secret that the Vemene still
control them, and use them for a base of operations.  Most people
believe that the Vemene were ousted in 1145 during the infamous Red
River fiasco, where the police arrested numerous organized figures. 
The Oriflamme Police suspect that the
holdings are still controlled by the Vemene, but haven\'t been able to
prove it.  The Holdings do wield political power, and are able to
influence the selection of two representatives to the Assembly of
Worlds.  The Androv and Kircheff holdings are in the same political
district and wield a slim majority and are able select their candidate
at will.  Currently their representative is Dame Monica Kold. She is
very aware of the true nature of the holdings and of the Vemene. 
Holgren Holding is a minority holding in its district and is only able
to veto offensive candidates.  
     In times of war they act as  an intelligence service much as they
did for Duchess Margaret.  When their holdings are not involved in the
war, they act as freelance agents. Spying, assassinating and sabatoging
for the highest bidder.  They even do some of this during peace time.  
    The Vemene\'s methods of operation betray their intelligence service
origin.  The organization is divided into many small cells.  Each cell
performs a set task, and then hands off the money or information to
another cell.  The cells have minimal contact with each other, they
often use message drops.  These cells are larger, than they would be in
a true intelligence organization, they average about 50 people. They
are kept isolated, information is only passed to those with a need to know.  
    The Vemene also try to use cutting edge  technology, in their
schemes.  They use the latest in wireless communications and the almost
all messages are sent in code.  The use of encryption techniques is
illegal on Oriflamme, so the Vemene are forced hide their coded
messages in legitimate messages. Not all messages are sent this way,
only the most incriminating sort.
    The Vemene engage in large scale industrial espionage, primarily they
steal secrets to further the interests of their holdings, but they will also 
take the occasional commission.  They have also created an arrangement
with the rulers of Kal, to base raiding operations out of its starport.
 They have also set up a secret auction where they sell recovered
technology.  This secret circumvents the Coalition\'s official Auction. 
The Vemene doesn\'t have to pay over Oriflamme\'s host cut which is 55%. 
On a multi million credit deal, this is alot of money.  The buyers get
to buy wears at 10-20% of the rate that they would fetch at auction,
and they also get first pick.  Normally the Coalition Navy and
Exploratory Service get first pick of all ships, weapons and other
military hardware.  The Vemene will also sell documents saying that the
recovered gear was bought at a legitimate auction, allowing the buyer
to take the items inside of the Coalition.  The importation of
non-quarantined goods carries severe penalties on every Coalition
world. It is a capital offense on all but a few worlds.  The reason for
this is the fear of Virus infected equipment.
    Oriflamme is a very restrictive world, with many illegal and
control items. These include drugs, weapons, data encryption devices,
and others.  There is a great deal of money to be made in selling
contraband, and the Vemene tries to make as much as possible.  The
Vemene will engage in just about any activity which will generate large
amounts of cash.

	It\'s actually not as bad as all that.  Past 6G the volume of 
thrusters you need just to push your thrusters becomes so much that the 
size and cost of additional Gs goes up very rapidly -- even with 
fusion+.  I tried to design a 9G fighter and it took over 40 Tons of 
drives and powerplant to push less than 10 Tons of crew and weapons.  
Even worse, the whole thing cost something like 80MCr and it still didn\'t 
have a weapon that could hurt a warship.
	I think you could build a sort of "after-burner" with heplar, 
since the thrusters themselves are so small, but you couldn\'t carry a 
enough fuel to do really big Gs for very long.  Still, this is one way 
fighters might be somewhat rehabilitated.  A high-G boost would help give 
launched missiles higher CV or could be used for interception missions.
	The big change for warships is not that ships will go above 6G
very often, but that g-comp technology will no longer be the limit on Gs,
power and thrust technology will.

Also, it will become very expensive to GComp the entire ship and not just accel 
couches if you want to do something very important - damage control.  Stacked 
GComp works for fighter pilots strapped to their couches for the entire combat, 
but wouldn\'t allow any damage control on larger ship.

Hey, Jeff, thanks for the interest.

As a matter of fact, I went through two rules conversions before I 
came up with the KBvX.X task systems.  Before T4 came out, I 
converted the TNE rules to the 2 D6 system from MegaTraveller.

The thing is that I really liked the detail put into TNE, but I 
thought that removing the six siders from Traveller was 
blasphamous--kinda like playing D&D with percental dice instead of 
the 20 sider.

Then T4 came out, and I converted that detailed system (based on TNE) 
to the T4 task system.

Then I realised that the T4 task system was flawed, so I developed 
KBv1.1 (KBv1.0 had a bug in it).  This might be what you are looking 
for.  If you like the system, I\'ve probably already done all the 
conversion work for you.

Where can you get these two conversions?

The KBv1.1 system is the one you are most likely interested in.  
Peter Miller has it posted on his web site.  You can link there from 
the IG jump page.

If you are Word v2.0 capable, I\'ve got it in a file.  Let me know, 
and I\'ll send it to you as an attachment to an e-mail (or just print 
the stuff on Peter Miller\'s page).

You might be asking yourself, "Why did he switch if he liked the TNE 
detail so much?"  Well, the answer to that is that, although I liked 
the detail, it required a lot of GM work, and the TNE system of doing 
things is clunky.

Take a round of autofire, for instance.  In TNE, you roll for every 
bullet fired (I converted this nicely to D12s in my conversion--just 
pick up a hand full of D12s and look for which ones resulted in 
natural 12\'s.  Those were your hits.).  Since a character can squeze 
the trigger 5 times in a TNE combat round, and each pull of the 
trigger resulted in 5 rounds being shot, that\'s a lot of dice throws.

In addition, some TNE characters are allowed two actions in a round.  
What that means is that after you get through rolling these 25 dice 
(five throws of 5 D12s for the autofire), you can take another action 
in the same round to do it all over again.  Now, we\'re talking 50 
dice throws in a combat round!

On top of that, for every hit you make, you roll another set of dice 
to see where you hit.  And recoil?  That\'s based on your character\'s 
Str, and it is adjusted for each burst--meaning that there\'s not just 
one modifier you use throughout the combat round.  There\'s a modifier 
for burst #1, a heavier modifier for burst #2, an bigger one for 
burst #3, etc.

What I\'m getting at here is that, although I greatly admire the level 
of detail that was put into TNE, you\'ve got to be an extremely 
patient gearhead to want to roll all of that just for one character 
in one combat round that lasts 6 seconds of game time.

So, now, I\'m a convert to the simpleness of the T4 system.  In areas 
where I think T4 is too simple, I add detail.

Another thing that this affords me is that, with the converted 
system, I was always having to tinker with it for problems that came 
up in game play.  By using the printed rules (or, mostly the printed 
rules--I use KBv2.0, of course), this requirement on my time is 
minimized.

My recommendation for a new player such as yourself?  Avoid all the 
headaches, and use the T4 system by itself (with the KBv2.0 
modification, of course).  If you want to play in the TNE milieu, 
that\'s fine--just use the T4 mechanics.  I\'m running my campaign in 
the Classic Traveller era circa 1105, and there is no problems at all 
using the T4 mechanics.

Of course, if you do this, much of the mumbo jumbo in your TNE 
products will no longer be useful.  I\'ve found that CT and MT are 
much easier conversions (some conversions means things 
like--weapons don\'t require conversion while armor does) than TNE.

I\'d use the TNE adventure modules, history, and ideas, but I\'d only 
use the T4 game mechanics system.

This also has the benefit of keeping you current on the official 
(read in-print) game as it continues to come out.

Even so, let me know if you want the TNE coversion I did (or look at 
it on Peter Miller\'s site).

My TNE rules conversion fixes this by using KBv1.1.  You\'ll see it in 
the rules I mentioned above.  You can just as easily use KBv2.0, 
which is a much, much better task system.

If you have any other questions/comments, then you know how to reach 
me.  

Good luck,

Kenneth.

I\'d immagine the Imperial tax collection system is greatly decentralized.
Local systems would bear much of the burden of tax collection, sending on
processed information to the next level of the imperial beurocracy. Even
then, the computers used would probably run on massively parallel
architecture, greatly speeding up the process.

The IRS\'s problem is that it is still using machines that do not have any
sort of parallel processing, and likely are still runing under 25mhz.

Actually, IIRC EM wave energy is inversely proportional to the square of
the range (in meters).  Thus even if it does stick out like a sore 
thumb at 100km doesn\'t mean it does at 300,000 km.  As it is, the 
heat level at 300,000km will be .00000011 of the energy at 100km.  The
fact is that that star is hot, but it is very far away.  The fact is,
the planet is hot--but it too is very far away.  It is the same problem
with lasers.  The energy spreads out as the EM Wave propagates.

1) Infrared is an electromagnetic emission.

2) Electromagnetic energy has properties of a wave.

3) Waves can be dampened by transmitting an inverse of the wave into the
wave.

So, if a ship can sense, perhaps with sensors along it\'s hull, it\'s own
emissions, then it can transmit an inverse of the wave, perhaps with
something similar to a radio transmitter, since radio is a type of EM
emission, set to emit in the IR wavelength. This would be very difficult
to get perfect, so it would only dampen the emission, not eliminate it.

This, in theory, is how EMM would work in Milenu 0. This also may be the
founding principle on cloaking.

I did fix the task level, it was just the fact that he was ambushed, and
I allready had 16 powered down missles that just needed to be "popped."
 
I just ran a rough calculation, and I found that on average, a 500kt 
Xray missle will get through with enough for a critical (if you combine
the damage, if not, you just have 3 serious hits).  With 16 of these,
he is in bad shape even if you used BL instead of BR.

You draw a missile damage card in BR and get a 1 to 6, right?  Then
double it for Outstanding success.  A *single* missile in BR
(unfixed) can kill anything (and a det-laser missile, at that).
Also, since tasks are all one level too easy (look at the TNE to BR
task conversion chart near the end) getting Outstanding Success is a
cake walk.>>

Is the fix posted anywhere? I\'ve got a copy of Battlerider sitting unplayed
(finals intervened and I just haven\'t had the time since!) that I\'d like to
fix...

it posed some interesting questions (too me at least).

Q: Did Strephon know that the Final War/Rebellion was coming?

We know the Imperium used psychohistory from the Psionics Suppressions, and
that study continued at several (unidentified) Imperial Universities.

We know that Strephon instigated several reforms to try to unstagnate the
Imperium (and that Dulinor\'s assassination was a for a similar motive).

We know that Strephon instigated the Project Jumpstart caches as a solution
to any collapse (an idea not unlike that of an "encyclopedia" galactica
proposed by Seldon in Foundation).

We know that Longbow gave some kind of warning (of the Empress Wave)  [but
no one on the list who knows is telling!]

Q: Where Strephon\'s reforms instigated as a response to something that was
going to happen in the 1200\'s seen by Longbow, something that the present
Imperial structure couldn\'t handle and so needed changes? And was the
action of Dulinor like the \'Mule\' in the Azimov books, a single person
whose actions could not be predicted and changed the events?

Actually, IMO Virus is probably more like the Mule - Dulinor was really
more predictable.

So was the collapse of the Imperium *another* failed imperial psychohistory
attempt, or a successful Hiver one....

Thoughts anyone?

It\'s in *everyone*\'s best interests to make Trav reality match the
physical universe as closely as possible, minimizing hand-waved
exceptions.  The reason can be expressed as the Law of Unintended
Consequences:  "Every action taken to achieve a goal will also achieve
one or more unintended consequences, which may directly or indirectly
interfere with that goal, or cause greater harm elsewhere."

I agree that playability is paramount.  But the corners we cut should
(whenever possible) be in simplifying reality, rather than changing it.
Really piloting a starship to orbit would involve years of training and
experience, and thousands of decisions and actions; in the game, we reduce
it to a skill roll or two, and perhaps some description by the players and
GM of what\'s going on.  That\'s fine, because any given group of players
can "add back" detail to any desired level without encountering
inconsistencies, or breaking the system.

But when you warp physics to achieve playability, it tends to bite you,
hard, sooner or later.  Put in reactionless drives so players needn\'t
worry about maneuvering, and somebody discovers the planet-killing near-c
lifeboat, which remains a gaping hole in consitency to this day.  Put in
super-duper missiles so fighters have something to pop battleships with,
and you have to explain why the BBs aren\'t lobbing them directly at each
other.

The trouble is that, when adding a new piece of tech, it\'s often
*impossible* a priori to work out all its consequences.

I have no probs with BL/BR detection rules.  They tend to underestimate
sensor performance a bit, in my view, but not badly enough that anything
else breaks as a result.

Give me a heat sink into a parallel dimension, and I\'ll give you five
different above-unity perpetual motion machines.  Mess with
thermodynamics, and *everything* changes.  You\'re playing with the
energy-bookkeeping system of the entire Universe.  The unintended
consequences grow exponentially.

Traveller already has one of these, the black globe, at high TLs.  It\'s a
good piece of handwaving tech, because it\'s limited, self-consistent, and
doesn\'t violate any fundamental physical principles (none that I can think
of, anyway).  A general "stealth field" is a can of worms.  How does it
work?  What else can it do?  If it masks IR emissions, where does the IR
energy go?  Does the ship cook from having nowhere to dump excess heat?
If not, why not?  If it\'s a good IR absorber/deflector, can you build a
super-maser with it?  And so on.

And the answer is, yes, it would.  That\'s what people have been saying.
The closest things to IR masking you can do without breaking physics and
introducing unintended consequences are:

(a) Chill the side of the ship toward your opponent, radiate a *lot* more
    heat off the other side.  This takes truly scary amounts of power,
    and still only gives you stealth in one direction -- you\'re visible
    for light-hours from the other directions.

(b) Use flares/decoys to confuse the IR target picture, losing yourself
    in the clutter.

I like your train of thought here, Nick.  I\'ve been brainstorming 
about fixing the xp system along the same lines, but I\'m not sure I 
follow exactly.

Can you give me an example of how you see a xp system working with 
this?

If I do follow correctly, you\'re saying that (like you said, insert a 
method for xp advancement here) after you get an increase, it really 
doesn\'t effect your chances of success until you get three such 
increases.

At that point, the skill is advanced one level.

Is that what you mean, or am I totally off base?

But if you know the principles you can work out the details. The
Darrians
had the principles and they had 13 centuries to work out the details 
(assuming they began when Mire reached TL 9) and they still didn\'t have 
them in 1100. To me that is a lot more incredible than stealth fields.

No, if they don\'t have the details in 1100 then it\'s because they lost
the principles too.

Just a thought, the number one reason I can think of for the Darrians
not regaining their technology is FEAR. After the nova any study in
technology would be shunned for hundreds of years. Even after some of
the fear has been removed, conservativeness will impede all research.

ICKC (Imperial Cultural Knowledge Collection) aka Icky-C (Just what type
of cultural samples do you mean to collect?)
Culture: a. The growing of microorganisms, tissue cells, or other living
matter in a specially prepared nutrient medium. b. Such a growth or
colony, as of bacteria.
:)

But really, you sould keep it with the AAB, as much of the information
will be collected there.

So something like:

ACIC (AAB Cultural Information Collection)
ACPI (AAB Collection of Plantetary Information)

Or change it to some other string of letters and come up with a few
words in Vilani.

This is from the help file of the Galactic program w/ comments by Jim
Vassilakos:

Special note regarding jump routes
- ----

There\'s a curious table on the second page of Book 3 (Worlds and
Adventures) of the Classic (i.e. first) Traveller Edition. This
tables goes as follows:

World              Jump Distance
Pair     Jump-1   Jump-2   Jump-3   Jump-4
A-A        1        2        4        5
A-B        1        3        4        5
A-C        1        4        6        -
A-D        1        5        -        -
A-E        2        -        -        -      Roll the cross-index
B-B        1        3        4        6      or greater on a d6
B-C        2        4        6        -      in order for a jump
B-D        3        6        -        -      route to be present
B-E        4        -        -        -
C-C        3        6        -        -
C-D        4        -        -        -
C-E        4        -        -        -
D-D        4        -        -        -
D-E        5        -        -        -
E-E        6        -        -        -

Now, just looking at it, one would think that all\'s well and
good, but that\'s not quite the case. The table was excluded from
the "Traveller Book" (a sort of v1.1 of the Classic Rules) as
well as from MegaTraveller (v2.0, or so it\'s considered) and the
reason may be that this table results in an awful lot of jump
routes on your subsector maps, giving them a sort of "crowded"
look. In fact, I\'m convinced that GDW wasn\'t using this table (or
even anything approximating it) when they released the Spinward
Marches and Solomani Rim. Most likely, they drew the important
jump routes by hand.

Nonetheless, I figured it would be a good idea to include the
feature of automatically generated jump routes within the sector
generator, so the following optional table is what I finally
settled on:

As you can surmise, this table will result in a lot fewer jump
routes than the previous one, however, you might want to go even
further by creating your own table, perhaps a very sparse one
just to include the basic routes (A-A & A-B) which you know
should be there. Hence, when generating your sector, you can opt
for the official table, the homebrew one which I created, or one
of your own creation. The best method of all, in fact, would
probably be to skip jump route generation altogether and just do
it by hand. In any case, it\'s entirely up to you.

The only other thing worth mentioning is that regardless of what
table you end up using, red zone (interdicted) worlds are never
attached to jump routes. Hence, if you want to have a red zone as
part of your jump route, you\'ll definitely need to go into the
subsector file and put it there.

Kenneth,

I have already done what you have asked for, in the past I have converted
MT/TNE/CT into CSC values. If you have seen the table of alternate
materials, like the ones on Dave Golden\'s page I think?, those are the ones
I have converted. If you want I can post them to the list or email them to
you direct. I can also send you the messages from Greg on how he converted
to CSC values.

Just a little addition: according Newtons law f=ma, rarranging it to a=f/m
says that the force needed to accellerate an object of mass M needs to be
much greater than the force needed to accellerate an object of mass m; so
unless the big ship is apply a greater force to itself than that of a
fighter then the fighter would accellerate faster. In otherwords, you need
much more power to accellerate a big ship than a fighter which means that
it is very probable for a fighter to be able to accellerate faster than a
big ship. The only exception is if the engine of the big ship is so
powerful that the force it supplys is capable of accellerating it at
greater speeds. In other words, it is not the point whether a figher
accellerates faster than a big ship but which has the more powerful
engine.

   Well actually I was thinking of an American fighter-bomber, the
Avenger (I think) that had a crew of three.  It was the same type former
President of the U.S. George Bush flew back in WW II and was shot down
in.

   The idea is that if there are simply too many tasks for one person to
perform, add another person.  Divide the tasks in such a manner so that
the crew can form effective teams.  Works for the F-14 Tomcat.

==========================================

Everyone else has thrown in their own pet systems for T4\'s task system, 
might as well throw mine out there:

DICE CODES
- ----
Simple           2D2(Special Traveller coins will be minted for this purpose) 
Easy             2D4
Routine          2D6
Difficult        2D8
Formidable       2D10
Staggering       2D12
Improbable       2D20
Highly Unlikely  2D30
Impossible       2D100


This neatly side-steps the failings of all previous task systems, 
including KB 2.x. Namely, the horrid curve that using huge numbers of D6\'s 
involves.  And hey, it gets rid of those pesky D3\'s folks have been 
complaining about!


SPECTACULAR RESULTS
- ----

Spectacular Failure results from rolling 12 or more on any task throw.

Spectacular Success results from rolling 11 or less on any task throw.

Benefits: Easy to remember!  Chance for SF increases as difficulty 
increases!  Chance for SS decreases as difficulty increases!


FIGURING TARGET NUMBERS
- ----

Target Numbers are figured as the square root of the characteristic, plus 
2^skill level.  


SPECIAL RULES
- ----

Jack-of-All-Trades is figured by simply using the cube root of the 
characteristic, plus J! (JoT factorial).

Hasty Tasks: Characters can take half the time that is listed for the 
task, but at a penalty of making the difficulty 1 level harder.  They can 
take 1/4 the time for the task by making it 2 difficulty levels harder.  
They can make it take no time at all by making it 3 difficulty levels 
harder. 

Cautious Tasks: Characters can make the task drop to the Easy level by 
taking exactly 42 days to complete it.

Granted one hit and they die, but, when you have hundreds of the little
buggers flying around and shooting at you then things start to even out.
One big ship can easily be shoot down (especially if you have bigger ships
than does it) but hundreds of tiny fighters and then the problems are sure
to stack up against you.
Even though Star Wars is probably a bit fantastic for this conversation,
you should note that it was the little fighters that were able to
penetrate the defense net of the death star and to the big ship. The big
ships were there to offer support while the little ships went in and did
their job.

	High explosives are a complete waste of money in space missiles. The bang

	I personally don\'t see that "iterative calculations are too hard." Even
with High Guard, there was some iteration when you found out you just
couldn\'t fit everything you wanted into the hull. It becomes a bit tedious
when done by hand, true, but it\'s still feasible. Besides, that\'s why God
created spreadsheets.

	Yes, exactly. According to the hypertext version, the chart on p107, the
maximum T4 damage for ANY weapon is 3D. 3g3 DV of 0-4 does 1/2D, 5-12 does
1D, 13-25 does 2D, and every value of 3g3 DV above 25 lists 3D in the
Traveller damage column. I couldn\'t find an equation to calculate Traveller
Damage based on 3g3 DV. How did you come up with 8D damage?

	So? If it were possible, I\'d still stacked-G-comp the couches. You can
worry about damage control AFTER you survive the fight. And if you can\'t
continue to fight or run away without damage control, chances are you\'re
not going to be able to do high-G maneuvers anyway, so you don\'t care about
stacked G-comp.

The problem with anti-matter today is finding it. So far it is produced in
very small quantites in a laboratory outside of Chicago. There are
theories that it can be found suspended motionless in space but whether
that is true of not, I guess, is up to the GM.

Conservative!? Sheesh. Maybe in some disciplines.

But I can\'t wait to get my hands on a TL-10 fusion+ reactor, or anti-grav 
thrusters, which are now *way* to cheap, imho. (Suffice it to say, I\'ll 
be multiplying anti-grav prices by 10 in my campaign).

Let us not forget Jump Drives.

These technologies aren\'t even thinkable now at our supposed TL-8 or so 
society, so I\'d say certain Traveller areas are quite magical.

I do agree with the point that some Traveller technologies are "big 
steel" or "clunky"/70\'s compared to recent Sci-Fi or actual scientific 
discoveries.

I have a feeling in 10 or 20 years we\'ll look back on some cybertech and 
VR science fiction in the same "quaint" light.

No No No No No. I repeat NO. 
 
Dont lock us in to a universe where we can not do what we want, just because the laws of 
physics. 
 
Take Babylon 5. While it is the most realistic show on tv, it has things which are impossable. 
Like instant full duplex interstellar communications, batteries that fit in the hand that 
can heat materials to plasma. Not to mention jump drives. 
 
The reason for this is for the telling of the story. The story is king in RPG, the science is 
a handle, a plot device that allows the story to flow.  
 
Why cant I have a wooden ship? Howard Chaykin did in "Ironwolf", and Tenchi Muyo has them as 
well. Why cant I have a fighter that takes out a capital ship? Babylon 5 and Star Wars does. 
Why cant I have artificial uturine replicators and bringing people back from the dead like 
Lous McMasters Bujold does? 
 
I want to tell a story, and the strong thing about traveller is not the technolagy (which 
always sucked, but is changing with Gods own Games Designer Greg Porter), not the science 
(which has not always been great but it was workable), but the rich and detailed background.  
 
If realism disallows something that I want in my story, F**K realism! Science Fiction has two 
parts ... the science AND fiction. If someone says that it cant work , invent some bullsh*tium 
to justify it, like jump drives! (Jump drives are a plot device , and should be treated as 
such!!!!) 
 
Rember the first law of gaming : keep the punters enertained. 
 
BTW Craig, this is not a spray at you, it is at the gearheads in general. If you take offense, 
my appolagies are offered.

Hate that stinking canon! ;->

I can\'t say I\'m too enthused with the idea of "stacking g-compensators"
either, but it\'s an *optional* rule so folks get to do it or not as they
see fit.  I *like* options!

Bill, just a little more than multiply by 3. <g>  At TL12 getting 9g would
be:   (9/3)^3 = 3^3 = 27 * the required volume, mass, power and cost.

I heard from Greg today, saying the formuli "look good" to him.  But, I\'m
working on new stuff, not converting things from older designs, so I don\'t
know if there\'s some sort of trick to conversions.  I\'d guess there is,
though. 

The TNE(FFS)/MT/CT AV\'s *certainly* don\'t directly correspond with T4 or
CSC. The ship design systems correspond, behind the scenes, with FFS, but
the conversion to USP armor depends on a table. The VDS in CSC has
different formuli and different assumptions from FFS in several cases, so
VDS doesn\'t match up too well with the ship design systems.  I feel we
*really* need a uniform design system. It could be an updated FFS, an
expanded VDS, or a different system that compasses them both. 

Let me know what you come up with, OK?

It sounds like what I have started using (I think, unless I am totally off
base too). What I have been doing is (using KBv2.0) is this:

The experience value is your current experience with the skill.

To increase a skill, add 1 to your experience, and then roll three dice. If
the total is above the new experience value, the PC has learnt something,
and the number becomes the new experience for that skill (I have them
record it like 2+1, which means a skill level of 2 and an experience value
of 7). If they don\'t roll over, they haven\'t learnt anything and the
skill/experience scores are unchanged.

When the experience is a multiple of 3, your skill level has increased (so
improving an experience of 8 (skill of 2+2) means you end up with a skill
level of 3).

I use the "rule of 6" when the players role the dice - ie: if they role a
six, they add it to the total and roll again. This means they can improve
their skill past level 6, although with a much reduced chance.

I was considering the use of two dice instead of 3, but (without doing any
statistics) that seemed to reduce the chance of improving skills too much.

I don\'t know if this is similar to what the original poster uses - I would
be interested in hearing what he does.

Cheers,
Jason

Yeah, Missiles Sup. had those, I think.  The problem with neutrinos
(IMO) is background.  I just can\'t imagine the signal to noise being
high enough unless you were right next to the target.

Also (I\'ve said this before, I think), if you can make a couple kilo
neutrino detector, then military ships will surround their
powerplants with these suckers pointed *inwards*.  Now my drive is
neutrino shielded (you have to be able to shield neutrinos to have a
decent directional sensor anyway, otherwise its just a geiger

Wrong.  Again, traveller has always has big ships with high
g-ratings.  This means that they can get a decent velocity up, and
slow back down asquickly as any smaller craft.  Traditionally
traveller military ships always have a g-rating equal to their
g-comp for that TL.

Why is the big ship moving slower than the small one?

Huh?  The rating is the same, and the relative power requirements
etc. are built into the design rules.

Accleration is acceleration.  The desing trules have F/m built in
(although they assume a certain density in the simple design
systems----go over and you use the real mass value to get a).

Any omnidirectional radiation, acoustic, EM, whatever, drops as the
inverse square of distance.  That\'s the -20logR term in the signal
strength analysis I posted the other day.

\'Power level\' or \'signal strength\' would be a better term.  And yes,
that\'s true.  What you don\'t realize is how *small* a signal you can
detect against a \'black\' or dim background.  Before they stopped listening
ten days ago, the radio signal strength from Pioneer 10 was on the order
of a billionth of a trillionth (1e-21) of a watt...but they had no
difficulty listening to the signal, nor tracking the craft.

Yes, of course, but not enough to matter in this analysis, at the ranges

The original Heritic and I have had several conversations in the past 
on using Aptitudes with the Traveller task system.  Since I have 
finalized KBv2.0, I thought that some would be interested in adding 
detail to their task system.

These rules here will discuss skill aptitudes with the KBv2.0 task 
system.  I also want to add that Eris has developed his own task 
system, and if you want a system that goes into even more detail 
about skill aptitude, you should contact him for a copy of his 
system.

I, personally, don\'t use (or even recommend) aptitudes in my game.  I 
believe that a person\'s aptitude to do a certain task are adequately 
addressed with the skill and attribute components of the target 
number in the Traveller system as it stands (here, I\'m talking about 
all three systems--Book 1\'s, Marc\'s fix, and KBv2.0).

But, the idea of aptitudes does intrigue me, so if any of you want to 
use it in your game, here\'s how aptitudes can easily be implemented 
using KBv2.0.

You can consider these rules/thoughts a variant to KBv2.0.
===============================================================



APTITUDES (KBv2.0 Variant)

These rules (I should say rule-ideas because they are not finalized, 
and I encourage GMs to sculpt them into whatever system best suits 
their game) will add some complexity to KBv2.0, but not much.

What is an aptitude?

Aptitude referrs to an idividual\'s ability to do well at different 
tasks.  Let\'s say a character has a high Dex.  In the game, that high 
Dex will boost the character\'s ability to do many varied tasks BY THE 
SAME AMOUNT when the several tasks for which Dex is used as the base 
characteristic.

Confused?

Let me try to clear that up.  Dex is the base characteristic for 
several skills--three varied examples are Piloting, Gun Combat, and 
Dancing.  Let\'s say that a character has been introduced to all 
three of these skills before and has an rudimentary knowledge of 
all three.  In game terms, the character would have a skill-1 in 
all three areas.  Given this, the character has the same chance of 
success with each of the three skills even though they are all quite 
different uses of Dex.

This is where aptitude steps in.  In a nutshell, aptitude 
differentiates a character\'s ability among different tasks using the 
same base characteristic.

Well, some say that the character\'s skill level does a fine job of 
doing this.  As a matter of fact, I\'m one of the people who say that 
(which is why I don\'t use aptitude in my game).  But some can see the 
logic in paring down a character\'s abilities a step further.  It is 
for these types of players and GMs that aptitude is made for.



How to use Aptitude in KBv2.0.

Remember the target number calculation for KBv2.0.

                    TN = Attribute + Experience Score
     where
                    Experience Score = Skill Level x 3



Basically, that "3" used to calculate the experience score is the 
character\'s default aptitude.  If you want varied aptitude in your 
game, then just change this number.

To restate the experience score calculation given this, you get--

                    Experience Score = Skill Level x Aptitude*



*Note:  It is suggested that a character\'s aptitude be greater than 0 
and less than or equal to 3.  Aptitude numbers outside this range 
will result in either some very high or very low chances of success 
given the KBv2.0 difficulty system.

Including aptitude in your game this way will cut down on the 
complexity that most aptitude systems bring with them and ensure the 
fast pace that the KBv2.0 task system provides.

If you use the aptitude system, you will have to alter the 
character\'s experience score when two things happen:

1)  The character goes up in level, or
2)  The character goes up in aptitude

Just like in the regular KBv2.0 system, you should figure the 
character\'s experience score and write it on the character\'s sheet 
next to his skill for easy reference during play.

Basically, the only difference in the KBv2.0 system and the same 
system used with aptitudes is that not all of a character\'s skills 
will be multiplied by 3.  Some will be multiplied by lower numbers if 
the character\'s aptitude is not as strong in that area.

===============================================================



APTITIDE EXAMPLES

Here\'s two aptitude examples.  Consider these suggested ways to 
integrate the aptitude concept into your game.

Basic Aptitude example:

In the basic example, there are only three possible aptitude scores.

Aptitude          Description
- ----          ----
1                     Aptitude toward this skill is Low
2                     Aptitude toward this skill is Medium
3                     Aptitude toward this skill is High



Now, let\'s look at the example character from above.  He\'s got an 
average Dex-7 and three skills used in this illustration (Pilot-1, 
Rifle-1, Dancing-1).

Let\'s say that our character grew up in an asteroid belt, and he\'s 
always been good at flying.  He\'s so-so when it comes to firing his 
rifle, and he\'s lost many girlfriends because he can\'t dance even 
though he took a beginning class.

Under the usual (non-aptitude) T4 task systems, this character\'s 
chance to do any of these skills is the exact same, but when using 
aptitudes, we get a much different picture.

Using the equations I outlined above, we see that his target number 
and percentage chance to do each skill is greatly varied even though 
his Dex and skill levels stay the same.

Skill                   Aptitude          Target Number         
- ----                  ----         ----
Pilot-1               3                      10
Rifle-1               2                      9
Dancing-1         1                      8


To further illustrate this example, let\'s say that the character had 
a skill level of 2 with each of the three skills

Skill                   Aptitude           Target Number
- ----                  ----          ----
Pilot-2               3                       13
Rifle-2               2                       11
Dancing-2         1                        9




Advanced Aptitude Example

You can, if you desire, use as many aptitude levels as you like.  For 
even more varied results, try using these aptitude values.

Aptitude                 Description
- ----                 ----
0.5                         Very Low Apt
1                            Low Apt
1.5                         Medium-Low Apt
2                            Medium Apt
2.5                         Medium-High Apt
3                            High Apt



You can see, by plugging these numbers into the experience score 
calculation, your characters will become very individualistic with 
regard to their chances of success very fast.

Any set of numbers could be used as the aptitude range (as long as 
they are between 0 and 3).
===============================================================



XP and APTITUDES

This whole post is designed to hint at the possibilities of an 
aptitude system used with KBv2.0.

Another thing to consider is character improvement.  If you used 
aptitudes in your campaign, your players could also have 
another choice of what to spend their xp points on when it comes time 
to improve their characters.

You can use xps to improve a character\'s stats, his skill levels, and 
now, his aptitude score.

The possibilties with this system are vast, and you are invited to 
tweak it anyway you see fit.

If you do incorporate aptitude into your campaign, then please drop 
me a line.  Since I\'m not running an aptitude system, I\'d like to 
hear how it works for you.

No, the BB vs. BB duel is like a pistol duel with bazookas.  One of
the two ships *will* die----whoever gets hit first.

Hundreds of fighters is no big deal.  My BB (a Tigress (I\'ll ignore
its 300 fighters :-)) has 300 lasers or so, any one of which can
disable a fighter.  It also has 15-20,000 missiles.  Again, any one
of which eliminates a fighter.  If a fighter gets a hit, it has
hundreds of sandcasters.  If the sand is penetrated, it has meters
of armor.

Won\'t happen.  \'Sides, the BB could just run away and hold the range
at will, picking the fighters off as it went.

Then they will add weight (or we will add weight) to increase the
explosive potential, or add radiation, whatever, but the space can be
better used.

All true, for any *single* wave or coherent wave set (like a laser, or
(mostly) sound from a single speaker diaphragm or other vibrating object).

Such an emitter is called an "electric heater." :)

The problems here are many:

* You can\'t analyze and re-emit fast enough; by the time you know what the
wave looks like, it\'s already on its way to the enemy.  You can\'t outrace
the wave signalling ahead to a later emitter, either.

* Your hull is not a coherent source; the IR coming off it will be
nonpolarized and out of phase, so no one signal could counter it.

* Even if you could, doing so from an extended source would create a
chaotic web of maxima and minima rather than a simple overall damping.

* Finally, the clincher, though I\'ve left it for last as it\'s hardest to
explain.  Owing to the nature of entropy, the process of gathering data
and correlating the signals would generate *more* heat than you
"canceled".  Ouch.  Gotta hate that Second Law...

Speaking of which, my favorite formulation of the Three Laws of
Thermodynamics:

  1. You can\'t win.
  2. You can\'t break even.
  3. You can\'t quit the game.

Sorry, just had to share that. :)

I doubt that, the Swedish version of IRS (RSV) use some type of mainfram

What\'s the power source?  If fusion, then you get results a lot like what
I posted for larger craft, only with perhaps 10% (10 db down) signal
strength.  Even with your pilot in a vacc suit, that suit has to come to
equilibrium with the pilot\'s 300 K innards, and the hull with the suit,
more or less (cooler at the hull, actually, but still well above 200 K for
a smallish craft).  And of course, the fusion drive spikes emissions
through the roof, just like it always does.  So, basically, you end up
with a target that\'s an order of magnitude or two harder to detect, but no
other major differences.

    'body' => '  Sometimes all it takes is one little idea and it just explodes in my
head as I work out the implications.  After working out a design for the
ISS rescue ship that _____ asked for (Sorry, deleted the file by mistake),
I started thinking about the campaign possibilities of such a setup.  In a
way, it\'s perfect for player characters.  There is a reason for a group to
come together for adventures (they are the crew assigned to the rescue
boat), there is a simple way to replace characters who die (the scout
service sends a replacement), there are a whole bunch of exciting recue
possibilities, as well as what the characters do on their off time, and
the GM has more control and is able to develop the background in detail
since the PCs are in one system (except for special sessions where they
are sent to another system for training/special operations/holiday).

  The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea of a bald-faced
Baywatch ripoff.  That\'s right, it\'s "Beltwatch," the most popular
syndicated progam for Tri-V in the Imperium.  There\'s the ruggedly
handsome pilot trying to raise his young son in between saving the
Imperium every week, his odd subordinates, the attractive female rescue
workers who wear relic skintight vac suits that are just a size or two too
small (can\'t let that relic technology go to waste!), the kooky bureacrats
and evil pirates who make work such a pain for the rescue guys, and much,
much, much more.  
 
  Naturally, the rescue base is at Paradise, the pleasure and vacation
asteroid, since it\'s a convenient no-grav jumping-off point that makes it
easy to get everywhere else in the system (yah, sure - all the rich,
scantily clad sophonts running around had nothing to do with the ISS\'s
decision to locate here).  Since it\'s a pleasure resort and starport,
there\'s always an excuse for guest stars to show up (out of work washed-up
actors who need to fund another divorce), and if that\'s not enough, those
belters can be relied on to spice things up with a brawl or two.
  
  I\'m so fired up by this idea that I\'ve decided to run a PBEM set on
Paradise.  The game will be a bit tongue in cheek - campy like Baywatch
but true to the Traveller setting in M0.  I\'ll need four major characters:
pilot, doctor, engineer, and electronics specialist.  You need a skill of
3 in the primary occupation, and at least one other skill, plus some
medical skill.  Characters need to be active duty scouts (stop where you
like in character generation, as long as you are younger than 35), with an
age preferably around the mid to late 20s (audiences like that young,
firm, bouncy flesh).  Characters also need to be good guys (you can have a
dark secret in the closet, but no active Solomani agents, thank you very
much).  I\'d also like some minor characters (supporting cast, if you will)
- - those characters can be whatever you like,but with the understanding
that they will not be the center of the action.  If there is enough
interest, I\'ll start this puppy up around May 1 (we\'ll need to do all
sorts of housekeeping first, as i recall from previous PBEM games I\'ve
run.

  By the way, here is the rescue ship I came up with using QSDS.  It uses
6G Heplar drives to get there fast and cheaply, as well as operate outside
the 1000D space for rescue.  There is a four bed sickbay, space for 8
casualties in emergency low, and cargo for recue supplies and such.
Of course it comes from Generica Starships - who else?

How about touch screens (Star Trek style) and perhaps even holographic
keyboards. It\'s not something we would get used too very quickly, but it
might work. Come to think of it solid holographic keyboards (Star Trek
holodeck). Another way to fix the problem with being overheard is some
type of security field that blocks of your little cubicle from in/out
going sounds.

The Orion propulsion system is not neccessary (two c and two s is the
spelling right?) as we had the NERVA engine since TL-6. They actually built
it and tested it for and Isp of 1200 I think. Or you could have some really
paranoid planet that had a USA <-> Sovjet like armsrace and the orbotal
space is filled with smartpebbles, smart rocks, nuclear pumped x-ray with
shitty targetting et c.

An even more fun setting would be (I think) something on the lines of King
Davids spaceship where a really low TL plane has developed space travel.
Klunky Jules Verne space suits, perhaps a regressed asteroid culture to
avoid the problem of going to orbit at really low TL. Yank out your
Space1889 book and photocopy all equipment and other illos. Great fun.

"fair die"?  If you mean if they are biased or anything-- probably :)

They look kinda like the "Pentagon", only with taller walls.  The
"top" and "bottom" sides have numbers printed directly on them.  If
the die lands on one of the "walls" you end up looking at the edge of
the two opposite "walls".  Numbers are marked on either side of the
edge, much like some d4 are marked around the upmost point (as opposed
to around the base), to label the remaining five results.

Looked kinda goofy.  I guess someone made them just to prove that they
could :)

Hmm, think about this. Let\'s say I want to build a wall with AV 40. I
have a material with touchness 5. Then we get the following formula:

thickness = (40/5)^/3 = 216 cm

That\'s quite a lot of armor! 

If I then instead use 4 separate walls of armor each with AV 10 using
the same material I get:

For one of the base walls

thickness = (10/5)^3 = 8 cm

for all 4 walls counted together that equals 32 cm, which is well... a
BIG difference.

Somehow I think those formulas are a bit strange.

It already feels dated and 80s. The gaming trend is also steering away from
the 3D style and towards Warcraft Command & Conquer style wargames. Bet
nobody would have predicted that when DOOM/Marathon was the most hyped.

Can\'t do that as IR emissions are random blackbody radiation while sound is
more like lasers ie single to a few different frequencies. The sound
damping you describe is regularly done on transformers to dampen the cool
50 Hz (60 in the US) hum they emit. This technique does not work on noise
however and IR emissions can be thought of as radiation noise. Also the
technique when applied to IR would break the conservation of energy law.

The following laws of physics are INMSHO not breakable by SF handwaving:
Conservation of energy
Conservation of charge
Conservation of momentum

Pen is OK. I had a Newton that worked like crap but my US Robotics Pilot
works like a charm. I put all my Traveller notes on it and am in the
process of putting my NPC library on it so I don\'t have to go to the Mac
whenever I need a NPC stat during sessions. Anybody else with a Pilot that
has ideas on Traveller software for it?

The reason I do not believe in a VR style matrix/internet is not
technological but rather social. Who would want it except gamers, pornusers
and Cyberpunk junkies? Apple made a plug in to Netscape so you can fly
around in 3D on the web but after using it a while I trashed it as I saw no
advantage in it. XEROX Parc had some interesting ways to display complex
tree structures using 3D but otherwise I see no reason except
entertainment.

Well, thanks!  Nice to stumble into one of my areas of knowledge now and

A useful initial set of bands would be:

  Radio  Far IR  Near IR  Visible Light

Not much of tactical interest gets radiated above the VL band.

Here\'s what matters passively and actively at each band:

          Passive             Active

Radio     Equipment noise     Radar
          Transmissions

Far IR    Living spaces       Maser ladar
          HEPlaR exhaust

Near IR   Fusion cooling      Maser ladar
          grid
          HEPlaR exhaust

VLight    Hull reflection     Ladar
          Running lights
          Fusion cooling
          grid
          HEPlaR exhaust
          Thruster plates(?)

I mention the T-Plates as they have often been described as glowing in
visible light while in operation.

A lot of this depends on how noisy the particular band is.  In a noisy
field (e.g., a star\'s corona) a hole won\'t show up well.  In an extremely
smooth background (e.g., the 3K cosmic background) a hole will be much
easier to spot.

Both your analyses hit the nail on the head.

Perfect.  You\'d want ship emission profiles for various fusion-plant power
output levels, to allow "playing possum" (a favorite trick) to be modeled.
Or we could skip this in the interests of simplicity.

On my list above, the farther left you go, the bigger the sensor required.
That\'s why it takes the Arecibo dish to get the resolution in the 1 meter
band that your eyeball gets at 500 nanometers.

We\'re measuring power, not energy.  So the question is not how many dB one
photon is, but rather how many one photon/sec is.  That scale is of course
open-ended in the downward direction...0.01 photon/sec is (an average of)
1 photon every 100 seconds, and so forth.  So a TL limit makes sense, and
there will be practical limits based on noise environment like you
mentioned above, but there\'s not physically-imposed maximum sensitivity.

Focus does take size, but I think we\'re presuming that detectors and
emitters are being sized so they get within a couple magnitudes of
diffraction-limited performance.  You might allow crappy little ones to be
purchased for a discount...the "Sears telescopes" of the 57th century. :)

Yes, quite true.

Exactly!

Why not?  It\'s the same problem in a different guise -- pulling a signal
out of noise.  It would certainly make jamming rules fall into our laps,
wouldn\'t it? :)

I\'d forgotten you had written this when I started replying.  Let\'s see how

Another good thing to do with this band is look for the gravity-wave shock
caused by a mass entering or leaving jumpspace.

Neutrinos come in energy bands too -- you might be able to tell different

Pulling radio into 3 bands is fairly useful.  The band you call \'radar\' is
often used for that, but \'microwave\' is a more common label.  I\'d think
splitting IR into far and near is a useful thing to do, just to put 300 K
and ~10,000 K sources into different buckets.  And UV+ I\'m having trouble
imagining what it\'d be looking for.

  Young ensign looks up from his console in the midst of battle:

  "Cap\'n!  Gamma-ray burst, 312 by 24-4!"
  "Range, ensign?"
  "Uh...330 kiloparsecs.  Never mind."

You would see nuke-pumped x-ray lasers and so forth, but they\'d put out
enough in visible and IR that I can\'t see the need to put in UV+ detectors
for them.  I\'m willing to have the need for UV+ demonstrated, however.

Too bad you weren\'t around over the last two weeks when this "Fighter

Don\'t expect a reply, though.  I\'m finished with that topic for a

Although one should avoid me-too-isms on mailinglists this one is an exception:

I agreee fully with the above poster.
The reson is that I play with scientifically literate people and if I made
some stupid plotdevice SF shit (HEPLAR for instance) they will find
loopholes and contradictions that make it hard for me as a ref but worst of
all their belief in the Traveller universe gets damaged and they get
plucked out into the real world and start thinking about their characters
as skillpoints, defenserolls etc instead of real living humans/aliens.

Actually RPG follows the same rules as fiction ie:
The stories/adventures has to be consistent with the genre and most people
agree Traveller is supposed to be hard SF so you\'re allowed to break one
law of physics but then you\'ll have to live with the consequences. Actually
Traveller break quite a few laws of physics but the duty of the mailing
lists is to come up with fixes or handwaves to make scientifically literate
people still believe in the universe.

The guy that wrote:
>The reason for this is for the telling of the story. The story is king in
>RPG, the science is
>a handle, a plot device that allows the story to flow.

should take a look at a great rpg in the space opera genre: It is called
Star Wars has great artwork high drama wacky science and technology and
playable rules. What it does NOT have is internal consistency but that
should be no problem; the story is king, if I want small kuddly TL 0
teddybears beat the crap out of "An entire legion of my best troops" that\'s
OK because my players are romantic TV-junkie morons.

Oops a little rash perhaps but I say: Those wanting to play Space Opera do
it but don\'t come dragging with some kind of universal law that says
science andd tech is just plot devices because that is the MAIN reason why
most movies/TV is so bad. In space opera science and tech is plotdevices
but that is one genre out of many. The reason Space Opera is so popular is
that we live in an undereducated world where most people equate science
with magic. My Traveller players have been, astronomers, programmers,
chemists, fighterpilots, cops, astrophyscists etc and I have to run a
universe that seems believable to them.

Au contraire!  It increases your chances of success by 1 every time 
you gain from experience.  After 3 such improvements your chance of 
success is +3 higher -- the same as if you had a skill level 1 higher
than before -- and lo! it\'s true.  What I\'ve done is to define skill 
level as experience/3 (round down).

On gaining the new skill level, the character may need or wish to 
obtain official certification of proficiency.  At class A and B 
starports, there are facilities capable of rating most shipboard 
skills via simulator, at a cost of Cr 1000 per level of certification 
(e.g. a pilot-3 certificate will cost Cr 3000 to test for).  Most
skills do not need certification, but medical and shipboard ones do
for employment at that skill level.  Thus, a pilot-3 certified at 
pilot-2 gains only +10% salary bonus, instead of +20% for a certified 
pilot-3 on a merchant vessel.

Note that this testing is statistical in nature, using the Imperial 
KB standard (IKBS) system to simulate a large number of tasks, the 
average success on which is compared to a skill profile.  It would 
take a spectacular failure to miss certification, IMO.

The advantage of the "incremental" experience points between skills 
is that the experience + stat profile is smooth instead of jumping 
abruptly on skill level increase.  And you can never quite quantify 
people\'s skills -- is this woman a newly-recertified pilot-3, or a 
very experienced (exp=11) one?

Also the structure volume component should go up as well. To be realistic
the larger the ship the larger percentage of structure should be required
for a give G rating (square-cube law). This is the opposite of how
structure work in the rules and therefore unrealistically penalizes
fighters vs big ships.
Fighters need all the handwaving we can muster to be useful so why give
them disadvantages that are actually unrealistic?

Especially in the Traveller universe where the super high tech Ancients
wiped themselves out for no apparent reason. Before the Darriansd
supplement and Secret of the ancients came out I thought the Darrians were
pushed back technologywise by the ancients that were still around but
hidden somewhere.

I bet the Darrians might have thought the same or perhaps they, like the
US, thought that they could recover without decent schools and after a few
generations became so uneducated that they no longer realised they were low
tech;)

Bill, just a little more than multiply by 3. <g>  At TL12 getting 9g would
be:   (9/3)^3 = 3^3 = 27 * the required volume, mass, power and cost.

I\'m curious to why he uses these formulae. They only make sense for
spherical explosions (HE) rounds and fits data extremely bad for KEAP and
normal bullets.
I believe they\'re based on WWII data when most antitank weaponry were HE or
badly made shaped charge but today or in the future=8A

This to my mind was the worst task system that I\'ve ever laid my eyes upon.
Traveller uses D6, preferrably 2D6 and nothing else. When one of
Grandfathers children started using 2D8 in his RPG tasksystem Grandfather
decided to eliminate them and started the war. When that Nilsen guy mucked
about with strange and unholy dice the Virus was spread and the third
Empire was destroyed.

All written in the same humorous vein as the above tasksystem as nobody in
ther right mind could seriously believe such an abomination might work.

Yes, yes! Give me more of those facts. This 1e-21 watts was received by
what antenna? What area did it have. It would also be interesting to know
what noise temperature the amps had if that\'s the right term. Does anybody
know what the IRAS sattelites sensitivity was?

Assuming of course that you can add AV figures which the above formula

The G problem is also a tons of stress per square meter problem. One think
that has bothered med (until I fixed it in my own design system) is the
implied equality between tensile strength and armour toughness. They\'re no
at all the same and at high impact velocites tougness is more or less
equated to density.

I just wanted to jump into the computer thread and post some of what I 
believe computers are like in trav.  This is based on speculation and what i 
think would be "cool\' for my players.  Im going town the TL list starting 
with the 1980\'s

TL-7 Basic machines, Apple II\'s Commodore 64\'s etc...

TL-8 Late 1980\'s. 80x86 line etc...  Apearence of portable computers and 
CD-Roms.

TL-9 This is where we are today, Pentiums, primative VR. Global Data Net, 
DVD\'s etc...

TL-10 This is where you could be cyperpunk if you want, I dont.  Wearable 
computing systems (HUD and pocket CPU). Satalite comm network, workable VR 
ware, smaller optical storage devices, primative datacrystals. Star Trek:TNG 
Stlye"Dynamic controls"  where you can reconfig the board to match your 
style of input.

TL-11&12 the computer systems get smaller, and so do the datacrystals. 
 Everything looks very Star Trek-ish (2-D touchboards, Traveller\'s "Dynamic 
Controls") portable computers are now hand held datapads, the portable CPU\'s 
are now pocket size instad of paperback size.  Optics are so miniturised 
that a spycam could be anywhere and is!
Computer controll of almost everything, Road-Grid for example.  VR is still 
used for some applications, but experiments in VR and holograms develop 
the...

TL-13 Holographic displays with tactile feedback, kinda a 3d touch screen, 
no need for VR gloves and HUD\'s.

later TL\'s develop the Meson comm-net, no need for satalites, data is 
directly passed though the planet to the reciever, faster load times.

I know that technicaly the TL for late 20th century Earth is 8, mind you 
this is an average.  I beleive that the computer technology we have today 
that is top of line has broken through to TL-9 already.

While it\'s no answer in the official Traveller timeline (as it extends from
our current state of affairs), I\'ve always used the premise that cultures
with the relatively chaep intersteller flight of Traveller would have plenty
of space and resources, and thus wouldn\'t have the worship of minaturization
that the modern western world has.

Have you read CSC? Greg Porter explicitly staes that you don\'t
just add up AVs for layered armour and that you have to know
the total thickness of all layers to calculate the composite AV.

The relationship between thickness and AV is non-linear, so don\'t
expect to be able to add AVs. Under most circumstances, you just take
the highest AV of all the layers and use that value. ie. guy in body
armor in a tank uses just the tank\'s AV. If a bullet gets through the tank,
it\'ll probably get through the body armour.

If the law of Conservation of Momentum isn\'t broken in T4 then how do

How about for ladar detection? If I knew no one had UV sensors, I\'d use UV
lasers for all my Ladar, beam pointers, etc.

Likewise perhaps to detect near misses by UV+ lasers (assuming they scatter

Something that just occurred to me: the problem with VR today is
that you have to wear special gloves so the the computer can detect
your movement. I don\'t think it\'s unreasonable to presume that by
TL 12+, the computer will have sufficiently complex sensors to 
detect your motions without having you wear anything.

If so, then the keyboard-less society becomes reality because you
just point or gesture and the system\'ll pick up what you mean.

Most US government programming is done in Cobol and ADA.  According to one

government is used (the rest is deemed unusable on delivery, and yet is
still paid for).  In this study, the _only_ program used as delivered was a
pre-compiler that did not have significant user or database interactivity.  

And supposedly, the computers on the Shuttle are still using ferrite core
memory.  Supposedly each of the computers is less powerful than a 386.
Anyone know for certain?

Given this, why does T4 persist in using a 2D map for sectors?  I know, I

I work in this industry, and this is not correct.  From the quantity point
of view, there are more first-person 3D games than ever.  From the quality
point of view, a _few_ of these are doing good things (my own game,
Meridian 59, was the first first-person graphical MUD out there), and more
are on the way.  Third-person games will always be around because they\'re
faster, cheaper, and easier to make, but neither the demand nor the supply
of VR-like games is drying up.  OTOH, we can all be thankful that not all
VR-like games are going to be Doom-clones.  I think we\'ve all had about
enough of that (well, excepting the folks at id, I guess).

Entertainment typcially leads the rest of the computer industry by 10-20
years.  This has been true since at least the early 1970s (before there was
much of a computer industry!).  There are excellent Darwinian reasons for
this that I\'ll go into if anyone is really interested (it\'s pretty much
off-topic).   

Business apps using 3D, VR-like interfaces will become commone when the
information density is high enough to make 2D too limiting, and when there
is a real need to be able to interact with others in the same virtual
space.  It won\'t happen just because it\'s cool.  Still, we\'re within five
years (easily) of this happening in sectors like news gathering, financial
information and trading, and resource planning among others.

No, usually the system takes it\'s name after the mainworld. I.e. the Terra
system takes it\'s name after Terra, but the star is called Sol.

Traveller Alien module 6 \'Solomani\' has a World Index on pages 28-29 which
amongst other things lists a lot of stars and in what hex they are placed
in the Solomani Rim.

We are producing and *storing* multiple *thousands* of anti-protons
currently. And plans are underway for building dedicated antimatter
production facilities. Sure, it\'s hideously expensive, But it is the
single *best* power storage medium known. The military is *very*
interested. 

For example, if we come up with good enough storage designs, that 1000
g missile can be built using an antimatter rocket engine. And it\'ll be
*nasty*.

If you can pull that off, it\'s *just* as easy to lay alongside with a
ship\'s boat, and have the boarders "jump" over to the ship. A few
cutting charges will gain access to the inside, and away we go. Still
good gaming. Especially if the ship being boarded has boobytrapped the
hull, or deploys defenders on the hull.

Heck, it just occured to me that the "easy" way is to try to get close,
and then activate an *externally* mounted grav plate on the ship\'s
boat. That\'ll "drag" the boat along until it matches the ship\'s spin. 
It\'ll take *good* piloting, but not unreasonably so.

At lower tech levels a magnet will do it. Yes, even if the hull is
something like aluminum or titanium. It has to do with the motion thru
the mag field inducing currents in the hull. So in this case, it won\'t
drag you *to* the ship, but it will let the ship\'s spin drag you along!

These are part of an ongoing Hiver manipulation to make Terrans loath

Yes, but the air supply would be the *same* size, and the
heating/cooling needs won\'t change *that* much. The pilot will be in a
suit anyway, but it doesn\'t really cost enough more to worry about to
pressurize the cockpit. If the cockpit takes a hit, he can close his
helmet and still use the fighter\'s life support. He needs to save the
LS pack of his suit in case he has to eject. He may be floating in
space for *hours* before he\'s picked up! Maybe even a day or so.

You just gave me a *new* idea regarding sand. Part of it\'s function is
to obscure the ship\'s position. It gets ejected *hot*. And any of it
hit by laser fire will cool as slowly as possible from the obscuring
temp ranges (ie high emissivity until it hits the temp band the
radiators work at and low emissity while in that band). 

So every time a laser hits a cloud of sand, it\'s *creating* IR decoys!

I like it. Heck, if you have the spare laser capacity, it\'d even be
worthwhile firing some of your own lasers into it if there were a *lot*
of missiles coming, but out of range of your lasers. Get them going on
the wrong heading to give you extra time.

Unless you expect impact velocities *below* 3 km/sec there\'s no *need*
for explosives, as at 3 km/sec the missile has enough kinetic energy
that it will act as if *all* of it was TNT! And the energy goes up as
the *square* of the velocity.

This is how a paint chip blasted a thumbnail-sized crater in one of the
Space Shuttle\'s windows a few years back. Sheer kinetic energy.

And "deadfall" ordinance like this is next to impossible to get on
target. If you are going to try, your best bet is a rapid-fire gauss
gun fire a few thousand 25 gram (about an ounce) projectiles in the
general direction of where you *think* the ship will be. That few
thousand rounds will only weigh 25 kilos per thousand, and assuming a
closing velocity of 300 km/sec, each round impacts with the power of
250 kilos of TNT!

So "machine guns" have a place in Traveller.

I don\'t know, but I\'m working on a "Gazetteer" (ie map "index") for all
the eras I have data for. Since it\'s sectors, subsectors, stars and
planets, it\'s all "astrographic" data. So I figure it should have a
name using "Gazetteer" and "Astrographic". Something like GAS
(Gazetteer of the Astrographic Society). Any ideas? 

I have the advantage that Gazetteers tend to be dated anyway. So I can
just stick a year or period name on the end.

If folks want to help with the data entry, let me know. I\'m using dBase
III+, so that format or comma and quote delimited ASCII will be best.
I\'ll post the structure if folks are interested.

ps. the nice thing about this is that it will wind up indexing all
references to the info, but shouldn\'t compromise the copyrights on the
material. So I ought to be able to publish it on the web without much
trouble.

Actually, there should be no such need. You see, our *current,

work. They help detect ore bodies, and petroleum deposits. 

Remember, most mass detectors are actually providing a *density* map.
They can be set up to only look for gravity *waves*, but that prevents
sensing "static" masses. (ie yiou can only detect mass/energy *changes*).

If you have multiple sensors spread out in space, you can\'t spoof them
that way. They\'ll be getting *direction* info as well as amplitude, so
they\'ll notice that they have two signals, one distant, one close.

Wouldn\'t need to do it like that. You can have a record of typical emissions
the ship produces in a given situation and transmit based on that
information. This would go a long way in dampening the emissions made by the
power plant.

Data gathering would simply be passive IR sensors along the hull to correct
for past data gathered. If a change is detected, and observed by the sensors
over a period of a minute or so, a counter signal can be transmitted to
dampen that until the sensors detect that emision to cease. If the signal
becomes permanent, it could be a sign of a maintenance problem, etc, but
would be cataloged and dealt with.

You can never have a perfect way for masking all the IR because of one
problem, reflected IR from other heat sources. My main idea was a way to
dampen sources like the power plant and other emission sources that could be
measured over time and cataloged by the ships computer. You can\'t end up
with a stealth ship, but it will keep the ship from lighting up like a
lighthouse in deep space.

Slight problem. As Vernor Vinge and others point out, within a century
the technology will be *beyond* anything we could imagine (Vinge calls
it "The Singularity"). 

It\'s even being said that we may never *reach* the stars, because of
the speed at which networking will expand. By the time we\'d have the
technology to go, we couldn\'t handle being (effictively) disconnected
from the network. So we\'d have to get FTL communications before we
could spread out that far.

Genetics and other fields have similar problems with the results
cascading in the not too distant future.

Hell, if you haven\'t seen my comments about what fusion power and
advanced materials technology will do, try to find them in the
archives. 

As a brief summary, fusion makes it possible to turn any matter into a
plasma and "filter" out individual *isotopes*. That kills mining,
except for a very few things like gemstones, decorative stone for
construction, and organics (coal and oil as chemical feedstocks).

Manufacturing techniques will be at the "feed in the computer generated
specs, and the \'faber\'(fabricator) will assemble the item from
individual *atoms*". The only considerations are speed, and size of
item that the unit can handle. This makes manufacturing unrecognizable.

And this makes 90% of Traveller impossible or silly. And a game based
on this *realistic* projection wouldn\'t sell. Because most folks either
wouldn\'t believe it, or couldn\'t understand it.

Two problems. First, it takes 450,000 km (1.5 light seconds) to reach
that speed. And in 300 seconds, a ship with *one* g drive covers 450
km. So the ship won\'t be where you aimed, and the missile has a hard
time getting a lock at the starting distance. 

It also requires an *enormous* amount of fuel/power.

Oh, we can design a missile that does 1000 g *now*. I believe a couple
of missiles designed for the terminal intercept part of the ABM system
*did* have that kind of acceleration. But only for a few seconds.

Alas, the rules put antimatter at TL 17. And it\'s *always* gonna be
hideously expensive. To make one kilo of antimatter requires
180,000,000 Gigajoules of energy (you have to create matter and
antimatter in equal amounts). And that\'s assuming the very unlikely
scenario of 100% efficient conversion.

Actually, all weapons in T4 do max 3D damage (except shotguns) by designers (MM)
fiat.  There is a rule in T4 that states this.  The \'damage value\' calculated in
3G3 is a penetration value.

In the T4 book and EA, its called damage, in CSC its called penetration.

When the round hits someone, subtract the armour value from the damage, and 
apply what is left to the character, with a max of 3d.

Your 8d rifle will plow through up to 8 pts of armour, but, even if it hits an 
unarmoured person, it will only do 3d damage max.

a book that was all about TL advancement. Someone (Hans?) had mentioned that
the MT Referee\'s Companion (as opposed to the Manual that I have) might have
what I was looking for. Of course, being out of print, it would be hard to
find an availible and affordable copy. So, why not come up with a T4 book on
TL advancement in various fields (medicine, chemistry, communications,
transportation, computers, urban infrastructure, etc) written in a style like
Emperor\'s Arsenal. Each field could take up about 3-4 pages with the info
summarized in a table. The text could discuss what was availible and/or
commonplace at each TL. The CT Ironmongery supplement explained by TL what
sorts of weaponry were utilized by troops. It also included support vehicles
and heavy arms (howitzers, grav tanks, etc). I found that to be EXTREMELY
helpful. Emperor\'s Arsenal follows in that tradition. CSC is good for
specific equipment but we don\'t get to see the whole picture.

	Actually, the fact that you can type faster than you can write,
and more legibly, is determined quite a bit by the fact that you routinely
use a keyboard to enter information, rather than handwriting. Given that
handwriting recognition is actually pretty good at this TL (test fly a
Newton 2000 if you doubt me...the thing comes with the HWR speed set to
delayed, otherwise it\'s faster than most people can write, and it messes
up words.)

	Learning to write even on the crude devices we have today is
reasonably easy...it took me about a week to get decent recognition on my
Newton 100, which is the next to oldest model, with a real old OS.
	
	We have barely started to scratch the surface of handwriting-driven
devices, I really think they will be far more common in the future.

	There are two ways to deal with the problem, exemplified by the
two major players in the market: the Newton and the Pilot (WinCe devices
do not have useful HWR; the pen is used primarily as a mouse on those
devices, and their design clearly shows that the keyboard is expected to
be the major text inout device) 

	The Newton has two modes of recognition, letter and word. Letter
simply tries to match the letterforms your are using, string them
together, and guess where words are separated. Word mode, does the above,
then tries to match the \'word\' with a known one in it\'s dictionary to
guess what you have written. This is classic handwriting recognition,
because with practice, the machine tends to \'learn\' how you write, based
on what you write and the corrections you make. With current devices it\'s
as much training the user as vice versa...as a user you rapidly learn to
to write in ways that are easily recognized. This would be an ideal
situation for a neural-net type of recognizer architecture. 

	This has problems, though. It\'s consumptive of processor resources
(which is why the 160 mHz 64 bit chip in the Newton 2000 is so much better
than the 25 mHz 32 bit one in the older models), but that\'s a minor
technological problem. It\'s also, in it\'s purest form, very
personal...after training, another user will get worse recognition...you
just can\'t swipe a pad off the top, write on it and expect it to recognize
it. 

	Again, this is primarily constrained by processor power. If we can
crank enough processing power onto the problem, this is solvable. (there\'s
no computing problem in the world enough teraflops can\'t handle ;-)

	The second approach, exemplified by the Pilot (and the same
software on the Newton, called Graffiti) is to make the user use a
specialized gesture sequence for letterform recognition. This is limiting
in that the user needs to learn a new alphabet, (and I\'d REALLY hate to
try to decipher the handwritten notes of a heavy Gaffiti user!) This is
also much faster at lower processor speed.

	This is also known as shorthand. With the ascendancy of rapid word
processing, shorthand has fallen into disuse, but my mother-in-law could
still do shorthand faster than she could type, and she could type like a
vulcan gatling gun could shoot! (being retired, she\'s out of practice on
both, but she can still out-type me with one hand tied behind her back)

	Now, if shorthand was taught in schools like typing skills are
taught today, believe me, HWR devices would be very advantageous over
keyboards.

Im sory, but this does not wash. I have Star Wars, and while is is a more simplistic system 
than Traveller, It is still internally consistant, as it is a reproductions of one man\'s 
vision (George Lucus).  
 
Lets face it, if you want to play hard science fiction, play soemthing based on Allen Steele\'s 
near earth stories or 2300Ad (a better hard sci fi game than traveller, as the only thing that 
breaks the reality test is shuttlewarp).

I point to Issac Asimov, A C CLarke, Niven and Pournelle, James Hogan and other writers 
of hard science fiction. Sometimes these people pick up a scientific princible and fly with 
it as the focus (The Gods Themselves, The Genisis machine et al), they mainly tell the story. 
You did not see Asimov write an essay on how Psycohistory works and how the Mule stuffed it 
up, you had a story on how a person screwed up a master plan.  
 
Take "Double Star" by Heilien (?sp). He had realistic space travel in the book (with the 
characters strapped to high g couches), but it was not the focus of the book. The focus was a 
extra planetary plot and how soem dedicated people stopped it. The travel was a device, to 
assist in the telling of the story. 
 
While I want concistancy in Traveller, I aslo want a system that does what I want. Traveller 
for me is the 1100 year empire, of wars and intrige, of laughter and chaos. I dont realy care 
if some breaks the laws of physics, for it first and foremost a fun place to be in. 
 
 
And isnt what RPG is all about?

An interesting series with Gillian Anderson hosting it (It was in Quantem in Australia) had 
some interesting ideas. While they showed direct feed nural interface (done in Canada in the 
70\'s), the obvious conclusion is external electrical field readings. A ring, or even your 
clothes, monitors brain waves and other electrical impuses, and converts them as computer 
imput. Typing with your mind so to speak. 
 
They also showed VR, much like Neil Stephenson\'s Snow Crash. Thsi too can be tied up with 
WONDER CLOTH , and a pair of sunnies for that full VR experience. 
 
And they are talking about this stuf next decade, not three TL\'s away.

WAY to change anyone\'s opinion.  However, my intelligence has been
insulted, and that seems reason enough.

	I have to say that I agree, to a certain extent, with Darryl Adams. 
However, the story is NOT king.  The IMAGINATION is.  We are attempting
to look into the future, and determine what those people/civilizations
will be capable of.  How can we know?  Is there any way that we can
actually know what they will have 2000 years from now??? NO, THERE IS
NOT!  

	The gearheads, such as Anders Backman, are so deeply rooted in their
belief in Physics, and science in general, that they have allowed them
to pull the plug on their imaginations.  How one can play a RPG without
imagination is beyond me.  By the way, Mr. Backman, we are all very
impressed with the list of "scientists" that you have as players. 
Ooooo......Ahhhhhhh.  

	Playing a RPG is a form of escapism, just like reading a book is
escapism, and watching a movie is escapism.  It allows a person to
submerge themselves into another reality for a few hours at a time. 
That is the reason that we play RPG\'s.  The world as we know it SUCKS! 
We can\'t change it, so we leave it for a while.  Anyone who denies that
this is true, is lying.  So, now you tell me that I have to play
according to what is possible in our real world.  I don\'t think so. As
Mr. Adams asked, explain the physics behind the Jump Drive.  I, as soon
as it is possible, would like the formula\'s and equasions that prove
that Jump Space is there, and that the Jump Drive is possible.  Better
than that, tell me how it is possible to evolve a race of sentient
humanoids from Terran wolves, cats, cows, and frogs.  Come on everyone,
get out your slide rules, I\'m asking serious Traveller questions, based
on hard science, and I want answers.  If I can\'t get them, I guess that
I\'ll just have to scrap Traveller altogether.  WRONG!!!  I will use my
imagination to allow the possibility of such things.  

	Now, that being said, should referee\'s allow their PC\'s to run around
and create anything that they want.  NO.  There must be values and
limitations placed on any technology.  There must be a plausible
explanation that allows for technology, even if it is imaginary.  Hard
Science is a good starting point, and most technology should be rooted
in HS, but there is room for imagination.  So, a new technology follows
2 laws of physics, and breaks 1.  Find an imaginary reason that it can
break that law, and move on.  Try to be as logical as possible, and
provide a clear definition, but move on.  

	I personally imagine tech level advancement of a planet/culture to take
lifetimes.  Many scientists spend their lives looking for new improved
ways to do things, or to find things that couldn\'t be done previously. 
Most of the science up to Tech Level 15 is spelled out for us in
Traveller anyway, therefore, we only have to worry about Tech Level 16
and up.  Well, I\'ve said enough.  You can play Traveller the way that
you want to, and I\'ll play the way I want to.  That is what this
discussion will come down to in the long run.

Minaturization isn\'t done because of lack of physical space, and is only
moderately related to straight physical resources.  It has more to do with
human-scale packaging and power consumption.  Even in a society with great
power generation, you\'ll want greatly minaturized components for carryable
and wearable computers, for example, and then too you don\'t want to have to
strap on a fusion+ reactor just to power your hand computer.

I haven\'t had the opportunity to do that yet. The supply of Traveler

I could agree with nonlinear, but I think cubic nonlinearity is a bit
overdoing it... Well, it\'s just my oppinion that is just based on a
vague hunch. Who knows it might be the correct way of calcualting it (in
RL that is).

Is this kind a "cheat", ie "NASA et al" "knows" the Pioneer\'s course,
speed, and exact parameters for tracking purposes. NASA knows exactly where
to "point" the sensors so to speak. What would Pioneer\'s chances of being
detected by a random search pattern by sensors that did not have any clue
about Pioneer\'s? I don\'t think that Pioneer\'s is evading on purpose either.
In space combat I would hope that the would not supply you the info to
track it.

No offense taken, the reason I think in the way of adding armor like
that is the I started my Traveller playing with TNE and FFS in which the
armor is treated that way. Which in my opinion is much easier and many
ways more realistic. OK, there might be some nonlinearity but that will
probably differ between materials quite a lot. Not that I have a very
good replacement or anything, but I just wanted to mention something I
though was strange.

Oh, so every park, jetliner, cafeteria, etc. will have a "Cone of Silence" room

I think this is a reasonable assumption as they in space technolgy they 
do have to use stuff which is bug free. None of this oops ***Fatal 
Windows Error-Reboot** stuff here it has to work first time.
But I do know they use a few portable 486\'s I think they definately use 
portables added for something as I saw them I a documentary on the 
shuttle. Perhaps they\'re for experiment monitoring or somesuch.
Any other people out there know any more.

A heat signature from a 100 ton craft is very noticable, partly becuase you
have that much heat in that little space. 
Background space has a certain amount of heat sources and "tides".
Genertated from local stars, planets, space debis, dust clouds, etc.

Craig, have I hit even close to the nail here?

If the above theories are true, then would it be possible to bleed your heat
over a larger area? 
Example, the afore mentioned 100 ton ship has the ability to spread its heat
signature out over an area of space 10-20 times greater than its actual area.

I could see two things happening if this were feasible. 
1- If detected the heat signature is spread out making a hard lock more
dificult.
2- By spreading the heat signature out, you have the possibilty to lower it
enough to be lost in the background heat.

Well, Im just blowing theories out, can the hard science boys help me here?


Last I want to ask a real world to Traveller clarificaton.

Why are IR missiles less desirable than radar guided?
Arguement: Would a Jet Turbine aircraft scraming through the atmosphere not
have a hign skin tempature? If so why are IR sensors not used more for
detection. 

I imagine there are some logical reasons, probably having to due with that
pesky atmosphere thing.

Craig,

Grab those books :)

Okay, I will be happy to admit that I am out of the tech loop as I haven\'\'t
had books for three years (still kick myself for selling them).

Now, at this time given the overall Traveller systems, what are the options
for a power plant?
If you are trying to build a stealthy ship, fusion may not be the best plan.
This is why I chose a grav driven vehicle.

Next as to the Pilot. First I know its semantics but let me stress full on
full sized BD, not just a Vacc Suit. With BD, the system is already designed
for reducing signatures (What good is that T15 armor when every grunt with
an IR shoulder fired missle can see him?). Also if stealth is key, BD
already has provisions for "Coolant packs" (forgot the real name). So I
would summerise that at the point when detection becomes a problem, the
pilot kicks in all masking features of the BD. 

I\'m looking for more suggestions on how to create a small hard to detect
craft. The primary goal is low signature, all else is secondary.

I have an end goal, and the design concepts. I want to role as much real
world laws into the design, so that the science fiction handwaving is little
to nill.My guess Craig is if I can work with you, we can combine
science/fiction/and game into a viable blend that stays with in the
Traveller milue, and not dive into the Star Wars milue.

This is actually a lot different than detection.  We are talking
about pulling a modulated signal at a known freqency and location.
The fact is that, if we didn\'t already know it was there, we
would have no chance of detecting it.

After all, if it was that easy, they would be able to detect
every single airplane within a direct line of sight (including
stealth aircraft).  (If you can detect the signal coming
though the atmosphere, then you can detect it coming
from someplace in the atmosphere).

According to QSDS you need 1129 square meters surface
to install a external grapple for a 50 dton ship.

According to FF&S you need the ship to be grappled lenght
squared in surface area to use an external grapple.
For a 50 dton ship this is 11.2 squared = 125.44 square meters

Seems to be a mistake in QSDS or?

First I want to say I\'m sorry about the wasted bandwidth with that large

there, though I\'d rather see a TL chart on the net free of charge, that
would make it easier to correct, and people here could easier come with
suggestions since it could grow dynamically over time as people come up

Right, I worded it wrong, I meant that the power of most of our modern day 
notebook computers will be the size of our modern day datapads(Newton, BOSS, 
etc..)  Mind you I have seen the latest datpads from "Sharper Image online 
catalog"  It is basicaly a small computer, about 2Mb of Flash RAM, all the 
old windows stlye programs, and can hook up to your pc for up/down loads. 
 In TL-10 this will eventualy become an entire PC system, with cell-modem 
linkup and the whole 9 yards that you can carry in your pocket or holster

I remember a TL list in MT Refs Companion that was very good.  Mind you its 
a bit dated by todays standards re: computers (written in the late 80\'s) 
according to that list we should be at almost tl-12 for computers, 
holocrystals are tl-13, and I have heard of labs who are working on 
holocrystal storage media at todays tech level!

This is an excellent idea.  I\'d buy it.  I\'d like to see a book on 
"everything you ever wanted to know about tech levels".

It\'d be a great reference for detailing worlds and adventures.

I\'d like to see encounter tables in it, and a section detailing 
twisted tech levels would be nice--you know, some trader brought 
PGMP\'s to sell to an Army on a TL-2 world.

I\'d also like to see a discussion on worlds, like Pysadi in the 
Aramis subsector of the Spinward Marches, that is rated at a TL 4 but 
has a class C starport.

Is this like visiting a third world country for advanced Imperial 
citizens?  Does the starport keep track of starship cargoes using 
index cards and black boards?  Is cargo shipped to the starport using 
oxen and carts, or is a WWII era truck used?

If the class C starport does use computers, how do they fix them when 
they break down?

How much of the higher technology from the traders in port spill over 
to the local economy?  What devices do they use that, on the surface, 
would seem out of place in a TL 4 society?

One of things that I liked about the EA was that the interior 
illustrations reflected this.  It\'s easy to think of all planets 
being just like it is here on Earth, but the pics seemed to have a 
very "other-worldly" quality.The clothes they wear, I think, did this 
for me.  I could see the things happening on another planet.

Just some thoughts.   I think that a supplement on TL could be done 
well, and I think that it would be a useful supplement.

It is so good to hear a voice of nonreason on here from time to time :)  I
agree, we get too 
wrapped up in why something isn\'t possible and forget that this is a GAME.
When I see the
replies that "well, if we hand-wave that, then my players will run with it
and build perpetual
motion machines and super planet killing weapons and green skinned android
women, etc."
I have to ask the question: Am I the only GM whose players aren\'t interested
in ruining the
game at every opportunity? I don\'t know about y\'all, but I play with a close
group of friends
who are more interested in a good story and having a fun time adventuring
than in rules-
lawyering their way into being declared BooFoo God-Munchkin of the Universe.
And yes, my
players consist of a pharmacist, a physics major, another nurse, etc.,
people who can and 
have pointed out problems with game vs real life matters. But they are also
intelligent enough
to realize that breaking the game will not be fun for anyone.

And often we get long sessions of hacking out "what-if" scenarios after a
game. Depending 
on how much it bends game balance, they might be allowed an adventure
campaign to go
research a new device or theory to find it they can create something. Or, if
it is something 
like a perpetual motion machine, a quick trip down to the local Imperial
University might reveal
that Porter\'s Third Law states that using thrusters to push against the
subspace ethereal 
web causes a mysterious loss of heat and kinetic energy into Dimension 32.
Where it goes
and what happens to it there might be the source of another adventure; that
Empress Wave
thingy had to come from somewhere.... <g>

Capital ships usually are moving much slower in a battle situation so they
can more efficiently stay inside the sphere of the battle. For a capital
ship to maintain a high velocity, it would have to frequently circle in
place. High speed is not always usefull if eventually you have to reduce
that speed quickly, which capital ships cannot do as easilly as smaller vessles.

My point related to high speed runs, which means starting from a slow speed,
quickly getting to high speed, then sheading that velocity once the egress
is complete, useful for docking with a mother ship. I did not state that
capital ships are incapable of high speed, just not well suited for tactics
of that nature.

Actually the technique I\'m refering to is either being tested for use on or
being used to dampen sound noise on some luxury cars, and I hear it is quite
effective in blocking out noise from inner - city trafic. Not 100%
eliminated, but reduced to a more tolerable level.

However, the type of dampening I am refering to is from known, rateable
sources coming from the ship, like the power plant, etc. This will work
somewhat similar to shining two differently colored lights togeather and
getting the result matching the average of their two frequencies. Example,
shine red and voilet togeather and you get something in the range of green,
I believe. The IR masking would be adveraging the frequency of the first
with a matching frequency, just 180 degrees out of phase (or as close as
possible to 180 out).

All that could work very well, but it\'s still using a keyboard for data

was the remark that high tech level comps "definitely wouldn\'t have key-

And I agree with this as well. I just raised the point that this won\'t be

Pocket Cone of Silence (Famille Spofulam, perhaps <g>), you will still
need a manual point of data entry.

I\'ve forgotten too much of my math to try working out an exact answer, but
I think the formula I posted above should be pretty close, maybe a little
high). So, I\'m going to use it until somebody comes up with a better one.

Funny, in all my lit classes I never saw the rule allowing SF to break only one
law of physics <g>. I think your last sentence above captures the problem here:

*lets whisper this now, so\'s to not get a lot of folks upset*

*looks around carefully*

*shhhhhhh*

Traveller is a lot more space opera than science fact....

The constant threads about thrusters, heat radiation, fighters vs capital ships,
0.1c rocks, IR masking, sensors, the broken to the point of non-existence
economic
system, the alternate characteristic and task systems, the believability of
EDU as
a stat, jump space, etc. seem to prove to me that the entire point of this
list is to
handwave science fact into a predominently space opera game.

I\'m sorry to hear that about your players, mine include a vet, a pharmacist, a 
physics major, an RN (as am I, with a BFA as well for balance :) ) and two
science-
oriented high schoolers (YES, I\'m doing MY PART 
to bring Traveller to the Nintendo generation <g>) whose belief in either
the real
or game worlds won\'t come crashing to a halt if I tell them "No."

Then please don\'t come up with universal rules for Traveller that state that it
has to be hard core and not space opera. The only universal rule for Traveller
that I think everyone agrees has to be there is "jump takes about a week"  <g>
And the universal law is "You do whatever is FUN for you and your players".
If your players like 
realism spelled out to the point of rolling 20+ dice for one character\'s turn in
a 6-second combat round, then more power to y\'all. I hope TNE or SpaceMaster
is to your liking. But this would cause my players to have that crash into the 
world of stat sheets and dice-rolling that you complained about above.

Which we have in this game as well, but apparently if we slap a TL 25 on it 
and invoke the name of Grandfather, the gearheads don\'t seem to notice.
And please don\'t maike generalized  statements about the education,
intelligence,
or penis size of people who enjoy genres that don\'t interest you. This could
easily turn into a split-up war like the CT vs TNE one w/ the Hard SF vs Space
Opera fans. I love all the weapons and equipment the gearheads put on the
list. I also steal and use a lot of the stuff that has far less basis in
science fact, 
as well. There\'s plenty of room on this list.

As do we all. But in my case, my players don\'t want pseudo-science in the
guise of hardcore shoved down their collective throat either (ever design a
small firearm in FFS? Or a motorcycle? A perfect example of the seeming
belief that if we can just throw on enough gobbledy-gook, it\'ll be realistic).

As a leading anti-canonist, I\'m against *locking* anyone into a specific
universe.  OTOH, I\'m personally not in favor of games where "anything"
goes.

I think Internal Consistency is extremely important to an rpg, not
necessarily reality (tm), just a game universe that is internally
self-consistent.  The thing about Traveller I\'ve always liked is that it
provides that internal consistency, and if you follow the \'canon\' closely
the GM can be assured that the game developers have created a well thought
out universe.

I, of course, being a heretic at heart *have* to build my own
universes.  ;-> In doing so, it\'s my responsibility to think very carefully
about how my universe works.  It\'s a responsibility I take on happily...I
enjoy it.  Some people might call me a gearhead, because of this, but I
don\'t think of myself that way.

Sure, why not!  I\'m slowly working toward a game with "wooden ships and
ether propellors."  OTOH, I\'m not willing to just toss them out there.  I
have to know *why* and *how* those wooden ship fly?

If you develop your own game-universe they I think you have to decide how
it works, and explain it\'s rules.  Now, think about how your explanation
affect everything *else* in your universe:  power production, weapons,
communications, people\'s everyday lives, and everything else.  And don\'t
expect to just handwave it off, because you can expect your players to
think up uses, effects, and tricks, for every variation you introduce that
you never thought of.  They will plow through any cracks you leave open,
affecting the balance of the game and altering the story in ways that you
haven\'t
considered.

Hee!  I like Greg\'s work too, but I\'m not as down on Traveller tech/science
as you seem to be.  Like I said, I\'m a heretic, I toss much of the
"detailed background" right out the window.  The science and technology I
don\'t toss...modify, tinker with, but don\'t toss.

What *I\'ve* always used was the consistent *framework* of Traveller as a
springboard from which to explore other alternatives.
Traveller\'s framework includes:  slow communications; 1 week
jump/cut off from the universe FTL travel; easy STL insystem travel; cheap,
plentiful power; automation/cybernation/computers that were big, slow and
clunky; gravity control; ancient ruins; and humans everywhere.  In my
games, I usually stay pretty consistent with this framework.  Where I vary
any part of the framework (either
culturally, scientifically or technologically), I think *long* and hard
about the how and why of my variation before applying it.
  
So, in sum my opinion is that realism in a game is how well it maintains
its internal consistency.  Monopoly, the game, isn\'t the reality of the
real estate business in Atlantic City, after all, but it *is* a consistant
game-universe with a format, board, and rules that form an understandable
and consistent game-reality within which people can play.  RPG\'s should
strive for just such a consistent and understandable game-reality.  You can
let the game designers create it for you, or you can create it yourself,
but your game should have one.

Which is why I can\'t understand why everyone gets so caught up all the
time in the "Hey, you can\'t do that, it ain\'t realistic!!" arguments that flow
back and forth across this list. Even the more blatant violations of the
laws of physics, it ain\'t like Traveller doesn\'t have enough on its own <g>.
Reminds me of something I always wanted to see on Star Trek:

<Scotty> " I canna break the laws of physics, Cap\'n!!"

<Kirk> "But Mr. Scott, you did the last 11 weeks, why not now?"

The players I referee are by profession: a grocery clerk, an unemployed
technical illustrator, a student/stock crewman, and an MIS tech.

No "intelligentsia" among them, and ALL of whom love good space opera, but
guess what? They all _insist_ on as much technical accuracy as possible.

We all have a fairly good understanding of the laws of physics and a grasp
and interest in what may become the technological realities of our future.
We also respect the laws of physics, which, in our world, means TL-0 teddy
bears don\'t stand a chance against armored troops. <g>

Traveller, by nature, appeals more to people who want a fairly large dose
of reality in their roleplaying. We play by TNE mechanics because we
believe them to be the closest to reality that the four incarnations of the
game have produced. There will be those who play Traveller like they play
Star Wars, but, like trying to use a crescent wrench to hammer a nail,
these people usually find that they\'re using the wrong game to achieve the

True, but a lot of the time the system is either:

- -- Named after the star

     -or-

- -- We can assume the mainworld is named after the star and in
   turn the system is named after the mainworld

Take Fomalhaut, Altair and Sirius for instance.

whenyou\'re in a different country), and I watched a special of the British
royal yacht Britannia.  Rather interesting - the ship is Royal Navy, but
operated not as a warship but to support the diplomacy of the English
government.  The film was great - a visit to South Africa by the Queen,
with a reception for government officials and a later tour of the yacht by
business people.

  So what is the Traveller connection?  Well, it made me think that Cleon
I really need a yacht.  Exactly what sort of ship it is, well, I\'m not
sure.  I took a stab with the QSDS rules, using the biggest hull included
(5000T), and the results were interesting.  A J3 M4 ship with no
streamlining (four 100T boats to scoop fuel) ran to more than 2500 MCr.
This included no weapons (Basketball is a peaceful planet!) since this is
a cerimonial ship, though a factor 8 meson screen didn\'t take up all that
much room.  even with a marine contingent of 40 and 50 stewards, there was
room for a 40 ton suite for Cleon, 200 tons of staterooms for his staff,
and a 300 ton reception hall/dining room and 100 ton informal reception
hall.  Total crew is about 150, and the ship has a nice sickbay,
engineering and vehicle shops, and top ot the line sensors and
communications.

  I\'d be interested in other ideas as to what such a ship might contain.
I didn\'t include weapons since such a ship would likely only travel with a
big escort of combat vessels.  I did include a small (100T) J3 M6 ship in
the hangers with the fuel scoopers so that Cleon can exit stage right if
he wants to - since it is identical extenally to the fuel scoopers he can
slip away without crearting a fuss.

Just because you spend energy to mask energy doesn\'t mean that you are
defeating your purpose. The energy that you spend to mask the infrared is an
infrared signal that it emitted in a way that, when the two interacts with
each other, their properties cancel each other out.

When a wave (such as an infrared signal) interacts with another wave that is
equal to it in all properties except being 180 degreed out of phase, the
result is both waves being canceled out.

Remember, in mathematics, jsut because you add something togeather doesn\'t
mean the result is a larger number, you can add a negative value. Same with
energy masking, if you add an energy type that is inverse to the energy
present, some or all the energy present looses magnitude.

Recall my method will not render a ship invisible or mask all the infrared
signal that comes from the ship, only the signals that are generated by
known sources. It will not be useful for masking reflected heat, since by
the time this is detected, it\'s too late.

One word... "canon".  Do you REALLY want to redraw every "official"

He did specifically use the word *minimize*.  What\'s wrong with

=46or Traveller, jump drives and high-gee maneuver drives are necessary
to promote the RPG.  While other games have tried to do without these
bits if pseudo-science (locking the game universe into a single solar
system with travel times measured in months), those that do cater to
an *extremely* small audience.

Story IS important... but it shouldn\'t be the dominating factor at the
expense of tossing away "basic" physical laws.  Otherwise, you begin
to play another genre-- Science Fantasy.  Like the "Dark Side of the
=46orce", Science Fantasy is an easier path to take, and one which is
difficult to retreat from if you make too many compromises :)

To take this point one step further, one of our players likes to ref
"High Fantasy" (we\'re talking about really wild and fantastic stuff).
The laws of physics in his universe are so bizarre that sometimes I
don\'t even know where I stand.  It can be quite "uninteresting"
sometimes.

Science isn\'t a "handle" or "plot device".  Being based on physics, it
is the "foundation" of any universe-- real or otherwise.

Tenchi Muyo also had Cabbits, creatures that looked like rabbits, that
could turn into huge mile-long spacecraft powered by carrots.  This is
NOT science fiction, but science fantasy.

As for why you can\'t have a fighter that takes out a capital ship...
you CAN if you want (which, by Traveller standards, would require a
bit of hand waving).  But then you have to come up with a reason why
the bigger capital ships aren\'t slinging these BB-killing weapons
directly at each other (which will probably require more hand waving).
All this hand waving eventually adds up, and you end up with more and
more loopholes that you have to fix (with even more hand waving).
This is why some players and referees like to break as few physical
laws as possible-- to keep things from escalating out of control.

Yep.  It is.  There is, however, another element you seem to have
forgotten, along with a movie industry that encourages people to cross
molten lava and risk death by explosion to save a dog (Dante\'s Peak and
Independence Day.)  That element is - suspension of disbelief.

I spent a fair number of years getting decent at physics, math, and
engineering.  I do not demand that a game or a movie know as much about the
subject as I do.  I do, however, demand that it not throw something at me
that is so obviously bogus that I cannot even bother to watch.

Here is a list of things that blow suspension of disbelief:

Outrunning an explosion
Seeing and ducking from an explosion closer than several hundred feet
Recovering from a knockout blow instantly
Falling from a great height on a regular basis, and not being even slowed down
Taking a bullet and continuing to operate.  Allowed in special cases, but
not for an average person.
Having something that leads to ultimate weapons, or perpetual motion, or
free energy, or whatever, and having nobody try to make use of it.

No, but when we are presented with a bit of fake tech, any idiot can at
least guess what the ramifications of it are.  The more training you have,
the better your guesses are going to be.  Your guesses have to be good
enough to preserve SoD.

Go learn more science, you might find that it does not really harm your
imagination.  Most of Ander\'s complaints of late have been about things
that are just not arguable.  You can make some hand wave magic to change
the way it works, but then you get to live with the consequences.

Example - in Traveller, as written, fighters do not work for attacking a
battleship.  You can make it work, if you add a fighters-only weapon, or
add a special M-drive, but as written, it cannot be done.  If you add a
special M-drive, then you just changed the world, and you are going to have
to rethink a lot of stuff.  My players would not try to ruin the game, but
they well might make it a life quest to find the mystery factor to put life
back in fighters.

Or, you can just hand wave again, and say that "they never thought of
that."  This does not go over as well, because entire sessions revolving
around technology and research vanish in a haze of "Do Not Enter."

>Ooooo......Ahhhhhhh.  

His list reminds me of my group.  We play a game centered around
personalities and interactions, but I am well aware that if I bring up the
idea of a kinetic kill weapon, or the ramifications of a nuclear damper,
then the players are going to "get it."  I cannot bring up a stealth field
without the players wanting to make use of it in a commercial way.  They
are not malicious, but they think that I, like them, have tried to make the
world consistent, with a reasonable number of changes needed to make it
work with the assumed tech.  From there, the principle of "People are not
STUPID" rules.

Fine.  But if you are going to escape in a way that at least pretends that
science works, then you had best pay a bit of attention to it.  If a player
KNOWS that we can detect a golf ball in earth orbit now, then some kind of
stealth field must exist if there is going to be any kind of sneaking up on
a planet.

>That is the reason that we play RPG\'s.  The world as we know it SUCKS!

Get a different world.  I am pretty annoyed with mine right now, but I am
sending out resumes.  In the mean time, relax.

No.  But if you want a Traveller player to care about what you are talking
about, you have to stick close enough to canon that what you are saying is
interesting.  Otherwise, you have nothing to say to the people on the

Don\'t be disingenuous.  They give enough operational parameters in the
books to know how it can be used.  You have some idea of what it means, and
if they physics is a bit funky, fine.  You accept it as part of the game,
and everything it implies.  Players are right to ask whether a jump drive
needs the mass, needs the volume, or needs to H2 in their fuel, because it
makes a big difference when they are trying to wilderness refuel a jump drive.

If science works save for the MacGuffin jump drive, then perhaps you can
answer questions about it.

Every game has to be clear about what works and what doesn\'t, or the
players are just along for the ride.

Likely, but while it is just a game, it _is_ a science fiction game.  It is
regrettably close to space opera, but it at least claims some science.  To
the extent that you want it to work, you fix the broken bits that impact
you.  I have a mathematician, a drummer, and an astrophysicist playing, so
I need to make the space tech and computer tech work in order to preserve
their suspension of disbelief.  They do not give a damn about the skill
system, the stats, or anything else which is assigned by fiat in the
typical game.  They also expect me to work out combat results, and not to
trouble them with it.

Your group might well need a different set of things to work for SoD.

In traveller, it is very likely that the pieces that need fixing are those
related to the science, because a great deal of it is broken.

Term I have used is "Recon and Rescue" or RnRs. If I could get 28 hours out
of a 24 hour day, I might try to participate this design. Always did want to

   Beyond the Hale-Harshman data, there isn\'t that much.  Not even the
old classic Traveller adventures that take place there go into any real
detail.  I planned on working up of all the systems in the Sol subsector
in the near future for Children of Earth.  At the moment, all I have is
a rough draft of the Prometheus system.  I\'ll post it here within the

I never really liked thrusters much, except as an easy fix to the
problem of bringing along enough fuel, but I like where this is going
:)

This might explain the appearance of the mysterious ship that you\'ve
just found floating in the inner Oort Cloud, showing all the signs of
a vessel melted & slagged by the intense heat caused by mis-jumping
through the dangerous Dimension 32...

Nice idea, Paul!

In order for this to work, th ship would have to deploy something with
mass (mass being necessary to hold or contain the vented heat).  It
could be done.

Not really harder to detect, except at really long ranges.  More

The heat signature will be reduced in intensity, but not enough to
make it blend in with the background heat.

These are all forms of escapism *if* they deal with things outside of

I\'m denying it.  I play RPGs to socialize with friends (which are
present in the Real World) and to be entertained.  I don\'t play RPGs
to escape (read: hide) from reality.  If I did, and I felt that the
world SUCKS, I\'d quit my job and roleplay every day.  Instead, I
participate in other forms of "escapism" (as you put it) by cycling,
racing, or going to see a hockey game (all taking place within the
Real World).

This whole post began based on a remark wanting to "minimize" the
amount of pseudo-science in Traveller, not eliminate it.  And it is
getting tiresome.  As you mention later on, everyone will choose where
to place the dividing line between hard science and pseudo-science in
their campaigns-- some will be shifted more in one direction than
others.

Exactly.  Just make sure that your newly introduced pseudo-science
doesn\'t contradict or drastically alter other scientific principles in
your campaign and you\'re set.  If you leave loopholes, you\'ll only
have to do more work to patch them later when the question pops up--
"If I can do this... why can\'t I do *this*?"  :)

   That would be Aldebaran.  Home, the Solomani Confederation capital
is/was located there.  DGP never got around to producing anything
official for this sector (that I know of) beyond descriptions of some
the member states of the Confederation located there and some
significant worlds and their location.  GDW named the "top" four
subsectors and gave details of the Home system, but that\'s about as far
as they got in developing the sector.

   If you can wait a couple of weeks or so, I\'ll post the pre-Collapse
UWPs for the sector as I have generated them for Children of Earth. 
Look for them here or on my Web site.

You\'ll have to ask Greg were he got the data from which he derived his
formulas.

I\'m less concerned with whether the results jive with reality, than that
they produce consistent and easily usable results.  There are some holes
here, as pointed out earlier, and it could be easier to use.

Do you have a better alternative?

Read the penetration result as damage.  The formula is DV^.47 -1 for
Traveller Pen/Damage.  

On a related note, I\'ve ruled that the blow-through rules only apply to
small kinetic rounds (bullets), and lasers.  Explosives, plasma weapons, and
other "mega-hurt" weapons should do their full damage.

I think the point was that the space required for the fighter\'s hanger and
launch tube, plus the quarters for the pilot and the maitenence crew, would
be better served by building a missle bay or extending the magazine.  This
would require fewer quarters, giving more effciency in operations.

Yes, it *certainly* is! ;->  It\'s also something that isn\'t allowed with

You might run into a *need* to stack or layer armor especially with
something like..."The blast from the attacker\'s laser punches right through
your outer hull and 2 inner bulkheads splashing against the hull on the
other side."

> Somehow I think those formulas are a bit strange.

The formuli aren\'t strange, they *are* correct for VDS.

It\'s just that you can\'t stack armor in this system. This is stated in CSC
on page 57 in the Note, "There is no easy way to \'layer\' armor in
Traveller. The only way to get an accurate value is to figure the total
thickness of all armor, and generate an armor rating from that."  So, you
have to add your 4 walls together and come up with a unified armor..sigh..

I\'d like a different system that allows for armor layering or stacking, but
I also understand Greg\'s reasoning for requiring that the thickness be be
raised to the 3rd power.

B5 is internally consistent.  They have never broken their canon for the
sake of a story.  For example, it is established that most ships need
jumpgates for interstellar travel, so only military and Minbari ships will
regularly roam free.  This keeps them from just invading Zha\'ha\'dum with the
entire fleet.  I have no trouble with hyper-effcient batteries.. we may be
far from developing them, but the technology is sound.

You haven\'t met my players.  you need to be consitent in your game, or you
lose everything.  If one week the players can\'t jump directly out of the
spacedock for plot reasons, and the next week the villian does exactly that,
the players are going to lose faith in their ability to acomplish anything
without the Referee\'s prior approval.

Space:1889, The Babylon Project, and the Star Wars RPG are all avalible at
your local game store.  For raising the dead, I suggest GURPS Ultra-Tech,
which has several technologies along that line.

The point is that Traveller has always had a hard-science edge to it.  It\'s
why I play it.  I know that jump is going to take 168 hours, +/- 10%.  I
know that Capitol is 3 or 4 years from the Spinward Marches.  Change these,
and your messing with the basic assumptions behind Traveller and its setting.

Which is tied in with the technology.

In a tecno-thriller, an assult rifle is a plot device, but if it isn\'t done
correctly, it will destroy the entertainment value.  When I start my van at
work, I have an expectation of what will happen with the engine.. If
suddenly I find myself able to drive at 250mph through the streets of San
Francisco, something is wrong.  It\'s not consistent with what I know to be
normal.

In a similar vein, if you suddenly change the way that Jump, or any other
basic piece of the Traveller universe, works; you\'ll leave the players with
no base.  Change the laws of physics, and somebody will notice.
 
>Rember the first law of gaming : keep the punters enertained. 

Mine are entertained by the realistic universe that they "commute" to every
other Tuesday.  They aren\'t rocket scientists (my wife, two security
guard/philosophers, and two unemployed), but they know enough to realize
that this universe is similar to the they live in.

If we wished to go wild, as it were, we\'d be playing Space Opera or AD&D.

I am a gearhead, and my imagination works just fine, thank you.  IMNSHO, it
takes more imagination to try to define a realistic future that holds true
to the laws of nature than to simply declare that "Hesienbeg compensators"
allow you to ignore the laws of thermodynamics.

Your telling me?  Mail me privately for a detailed description of just how
bad one life can get.  That, however isn\'t why I run Traveller, I run games
because I enjoy entertaining my friends for an evening.  When I play in a
RPG (rare these days) I do it for both the escapism, and to challenge myself.

OK, so if I\'m in your game, I can just state that the plasma burst didn\'t
hurt me.  Hey, it\'s only a game?  So I can do whatever I want, otherwise
you\'re interfering with my escape from the horrible world.

I suggest you read "A Brief History of Time" by Dr. Stephan Hawking.. he
descibes somethings that sound like they could be jumpspace.  As for the
plans for an operational J-1, well, we haven\'t built one yet, but that
doesn\'t mean that at some point in the future we will find the key to FTL
travel.

Funny you should mention that.. I visited my oncologist today, and he
mentioned that within 20 years, he expected that genetic cancers like
Hodgkin\'s Disease, would be eliminated through genetic engineering.  We\'re
at TL8 (roughly), and we are getting to the point where we can create
artificial life (oil eating bacteria), clone large mammals (Dolly the
Sheep), and eliminate genetic flaws.  The Ancients were at TL25 when the
created the Vargr.  Clarke\'s Law applies in this situation, I beleive.
Still, the creation of the Vargr violates *no* biological or physical law
that I\'m aware of.

And when somebody exploits you breaking of that one law in a perfectly
logical and consistent way?  Take the suggestion that ships could dump
excess heat into jump space.  Craig immediately pointed out the vast changes
this "simple" bit of handwaving would cause.  Hell, *I* picked up on that
problem, and I learned all my physics through self-teaching.  (I didn\'t know
the exact effect, but I knew it sounded wrong.)

My wife\'s Great-grandmother was born in 1906.  When she died last week, she
finished a journey from late TL4 to TL8.

Momentum is conserved, the two components just aren\'t connected.  That is
to say, your typical starship might mass some 1E9 grams, but the star (and
attendant gravity well) against which its thruster plates push masses on
the order of 1E33 grams, so it\'s kinda hard to notice its recoil....  :-)

But in a lecture hall or other conversational area, where I\'m trying to

of information, etc.  Keyboarding or handwriting has got to be available.

Artistically or logically self-consistent?  I\'ll grant you the former, but
the latter is a damn sight harder to come by.  And the two are very
different!

Untrue.  It\'s closer than Traveller and with better handwaving,
admittedly, but 2300 AD had its own share of egregious scientific
bloopers.  (Off the top of my head, try Station Arcture, which can\'t
keep aimed straight at Arcturus due to simple rotational inertia:
which wouldn\'t be a problem if they\'d just added a second but
counter-rotating spin ring!)  What\'s the harm in making your tools
and universe scientifically consistent when possible?  Who knows,
you and your players might learn something, which isn\'t going to
happen with Star Wars in a million years.

Asimov is anything but "hard" (though the psychohistory explanation is a
good one, it\'s one of his few).  What was the purple-beam weapon from one
of his early novels that some White Dwarf presented in Traveller terms?
Clarke, Pournelle, and Niven, though, I\'ll grant you.  Niven was told
"The Ringworld is unstable!" by picketing CalTech students, accepted it,
and then based another novel off of it!  So much for scientific (_not_
"artistic") self-consistency squelching all hope of exciting plots....
  
Heinlein was pretty "hard" for the \'40\'s and \'50\'s.  Alas, though, now we
know more about spaceflight (we\'ve actually done it, see).  For that matter,
a lot of Heinlein would have been fairly obvious pulp even when he wrote
it: see Niven\'s (or was it Pournelle\'s?) "Those Pesky Belters and Their
Torch Ships" for a nice analysis.

Darryl, I agree that we need to have excitement and variety in our games. 
But I think the place to look for that is in the _inhabitants_ of the
universe, in their cultures, beliefs, quests and plots, and not in the
ongoing quest for yet more gee-whiz McGuffin tech, anime-style robots, and
other technological impracticalities, all the while frantically trying to
preserve the freedom of the referee to make stupid mistakes about the way
the universe works.

Yes, but you still have to *produce* the counteracting signal, and it
will require a great deal of energy to produce a signal to cancel out
the heat signature radiating from a starship.

Assuming 100% efficiency (not very likely), you would need to generate
an amount of energy for your counter-wave equal to the *total*
radiated energy making up the IR signature of the vessel.

This is an argument?  He exhibits reason and discretion (note "minimizing,"
_not_ "eliminating" or "forbidding" in the quote above), and your rejoinder
leads off with that scintillating bit of analysis?  Enough.  Let\'s get to
the better-argued stuff.

Keep in mind that television shows and movies, under complete artistic
control by the writers, directors, producers, etc., can and do get away
with more loopholes and mistakes than an RPG can or should.  Or are you
advocating dictatory plot control by the GM to keep the characters from
wandering into embarassing areas of the universe?

> Like instant full duplex interstellar communications,
> Not to mention jump drives. 

Granted.  It violates our current understanding of physics, but doesn\'t
pose any really nasty problems -- unless you start messing with ships
capable of speeds near c (rare in B5, a couple of possibly throw-away
screen displays aside), in which case you get time travel.  (And, heck,
JMS has already played with that one.... :-)

> batteries that fit in the hand that can heat materials to plasma.

Big whoop.  The "material" you use makes a lot of difference.  If they
were using lead as ammunition, yes, it\'d be stupid.  As it is, it\'s
helium, which is relatively trivial to ionize to plasma.  And JMS has made
fairly good handwaving arguments for the use of PPG\'s as opposed to
slug-throwers (low kinetic but high thermal damage to maximize personnel
but minimize structural damage, supply and cost of ammunition, etc.).  So
he\'s scientifically justified it, and people don\'t mind.  What many here
on the TML are objecting to, it looks like, is your cavalier insistence
that none of it matters, and we should all be toting Phased Blue Tetryon
Disrupters that will scramble our enemies\' neurons, disintegrate shackles
but not the wrists enclosed in them, or cook up a mean breakfast enchilada
all with the twist of a single control knob.

> The reason for this is for the telling of the story. The story is king in

The story is king in RPG\'s, I\'ll accept.  But there\'s a reason this is
_science_ fiction that we play, and not Dark Dragonlance Sun in the
Demonweb Pits.  Fantasy is fine and has its place... but many are
disagreeing (vehemently, like me!) that that place is in Traveller.

> Why cant I have a wooden ship?

You can.  But please explain why it\'s economical with all the attention
you\'d need to sealant, connectors, armoring, and so on;  and why, if you
don\'t need to worry about that stuff, why everyone doesn\'t drive dugout
ships around the starlanes.  Or play Space:1889, which takes it all in
stride....  :-)

> Why cant I have a fighter that takes out a capital ship? Babylon 5 and
> Star Wars does.

[Agreement in number between subject and verb... down, English major, down!]

Babylon-5 _doesn\'t_, which is one reason I like it.  I defy you to point out
a single case of a fighter "taking out" a capital ship on the show.  JMS has
specifically staged on multiple occasions that the fighters are there for
purposes of harassment and to tie up incidental weaponry so that the big
stuff can be brought to bear by the larger vessels.  Fighters help, but
they don\'t win the day.

As for Star Wars... it\'s science fantasy.  Play it if you like, enjoy it
even: who are we to stop you?  But that\'s why Star Wars and Traveller tend
to cater to different markets.  Science fantasy vs. science fiction.

You can have as much rope as you want to hang yourself with.  Just don\'t
scream bloody murder (as you\'re doing), when more sensible souls point out
how your ill-thought-out cow-pucky could easily spoil the very structure
of the universe which you claim to love.

In your opinion.  My first law would be "Maintain atmosphere and
suspension of disbelief."  Too much handwaving, or a dictatorial
referee who forbids creative extensions to it, hurts both.

Greg Porter would probably note that, if you get super-effective anti-
personnel lasers too early, they eliminate the window for practical and
economic gauss weapons.  TNE began to push laser tech levels back for
just this reason, and Greg\'s probably just continuing the trend.

Consider this: I like to have a good mix of weapons available in my game.
If we go straight from gunpowder-based weapons to lasers, the variety
suffers.  If lasers, for perfectly good physical reasons, take longer to
become practical handheld weapons in a general rather than specialized
role, we have the "room" to play with gyroc weapons, caseless rounds,
binary propellant, gauss weapons, the BLAMs (Barrel-Launched ?Automatic?
Munitions?) that BBC World Service talked about just the other day, etc.

I would like a copy of this.  I am currently working on my own personal
campaign that is using Traveller (CT, MT, FF&S, T$), 2300AD, and Space
Opera.  Any new ideas would be most apprecated, as well as equipment, both
personal and starship related.

You are totally correct.  I personally, HATE action movies for this very

Fine.  I have no problem with that.  I don\'t believe in hand-wave
magic.  I never explicitly said that I did.  The base meaning of my
message was based in the following paragraph.

Now, that being said, should referee\'s allow their PC\'s to run around
and create anything that they want.  NO.  There must be values and
limitations placed on any technology.  There must be a plausible
explanation that allows for technology, even if it is imaginary.  Hard
Science is a good starting point, and most technology should be rooted
in HS, but there is room for imagination.  So, a new technology follows
2 laws of physics, and breaks 1.  Find an imaginary reason that it can
break that law, and move on.  Try to be as logical as possible, and
provide a clear definition, but move on.

Once again, you are correct.  People are not stupid.  The people that I
play with, are some of the most intelligent people that I know.  My
group includes a HS math teacher, a college TA in Biology, a bank
manager, one of his employees, and a person with a Psychology degree,
who is currently working as a welder.  We do NOT play Space Opera. 
However, we do allow for certain advancements in Tech, that are as yet
unheard of.  They are HIGHLY restricted, and certainly limited.  There
is never a rule that is simply laid down because "I say so".  My players
want reasons, and I give them to the best of my ability.  If I don\'t
have all the information, I ask them their opinions, and they generally
give me good advice.  I am intelligent enough to know when they seeking
benefits for their PC\'s, and can generally come up with solutions that
provide a limited, restricted basis.

Please don\'t patronize me.  I am relatively impressed with you

Again, correct.  However, there is nothing in the Traveller rules that
is written in stone.  Canon can always be changed.  Interest is a
personal opinion.  What I find interesting, does not always include the
whole group.  There are people, in the TML, that applaud what I had to
say earlier.  There are people, in the TML that will applaud what you
have to say.  We are all a group, and there should be no "us against
them".  Otherwise, we have to have two TML\'s.  However, don\'t exclude
someone because they choose to believe in the story, and their
imagination, as opposed to hard science.

Once again, you are correct.  As I said earlier, new Tech has to be
highly restricted, and certainly limited.  There must be reasons for the
restrictions and limitations, but I have to allow for a certain amount
of creativity.


	Personally, I believe that you and I think along the same lines.  I
enjoy physics to the degree that I can easily involve myself in a
discussion, and I perfer discussions that allow me to learn something
new.  But I will not research physics for entertainment.  I think that
we clashed in areas that were, if not unintentional, certainly
unintended.  Thanks for the response.

"Mega-hurt"... I like that :)

I assume that the 3d maximum damage applies to "humanoids", since they
are the main target of most PCs (and NPCs).  If the 3d limit is based
on how much damage a human(oid) body can take before the attack "blows
through", a larger target such as a bull elephant would logically have
a higher limitation.  Conversely, field mice probably max out at less
than 1D.

Actually, larger ships that possess jump engines of their own can
actually open up an entry into hyperspace and keep it open.  This
allows the smaller ships to enter hyperspace in the B5 universe
without a jump gate.

about packing H2? How much space is required?

Ok, a quick description of the technique to store the H2. The tank is
filled with grafite nanofibres, which (they think) slows down the
molecules so that 5 layers of molecules can be stored where there really
should only be room for 1 layer. For you who want numbers. Each layer is
0.34 nm thick. One problem with this way of containing H2 is that the
nanfibres stop working correctly after a few uses, but that might be
fixed... At least in a few TLs... Don\'t you think? :)

Actually 0.01 m^3 is 10000 cm^3. (There\'s a factor of 1000000 between

TAS Form 2   (A T4 Character Sheet)


This is a character sheet that I put together for my game.  I 
designed it in the vein of the old little black book character 
sheets--I always liked how functional they looked.

The sheet is and attachment to this post in Word v2.0.

There\'s two files--one for the front and one for the back.  I\'ve 
adjusted the spacing so that you can punch holes in it and keep it in 
a notebook.

On the front, I\'ve included personal data and history and history 
about the character.  On the back, you\'ll see spaces for psionics, 
UPP, and skill information.

Many players like to keep the skills a character has secret, and 
that\'s why all the skills are listed on the back of the sheet.

Everything on the sheet is in standard traveller-ese, but three 
things may need some explanation.

In the skills section, you\'ll find both an "Exp." and an "XP" column. 
 The "Exp." stands for experience score.  You\'ll know what this is if 
you use the KBv2.0 task system.  

If you don\'t use my task system, there\'s still no reason for a good 
character sheet to go to waste.  You\'ve got the word file--just 
change the "Exp." column heading to "Level".  I purposefully placed 
this column right after the skill name column for people who don\'t 
use KBv2.0.

The "XP" column is a place to record experience points for each 
skill--no matter what experience system you use.

And on the bottom of the page, in box 38, you\'ll see "Level Limit."  
In my game, I referr to the level limit as the old (edu + int) score 
from CT.  I\'m going to use a limit like this when I re-work the T4 
experience system.

If you don\'t want to use level limits in your game, then just delete 
this box.  I purposefully put it as the last box for people who wish 
to delete the box--so there won\'t be a whole in the middle of your 
character sheet.

As I said, the sheet\'s in Word v2.0.  If you have any problems 
obtaining the sheet from this attachment on the list, then e-mail me 
in private.  I\'ll send it to you directly in response.

That\'s it for now,

Kenneth.

Check the book in the Dorsai series: it has a well done (if scketchy)
treatment of non oriental martial arts in a science fiction setting.

The scene in which Graeme enter nacked in the room where his brother
killers are waiting telling "I\'m not a soldier, I\'m a warrior" give the
idea I have of a very proficent future martial art praticionier.

Implementing real world system to a SFRPG should be enriched by some
speculation about possible development and martial arts will develope as
well as other aspect of human life and technology.

One, it\'s " hear, hear."  Two, you miss the point.  The notion that
science exists _instead_ of imagination is at best silly.  The point
people such as Anders (myself included in this group) are trying to
make is that there are real physical limits to many of the
work-a-day problems of the traveller universe.

Like it or not, you need to recognize that something like a EM
sensor has an upper limit of effieciency that we can characterize
now (simply by looking at a perfect 100% efficient receiver, for
example).

It has been stated in this very thread that the principal benefit of
reality as a baseline model is that you get consistancy thrown in
for free.

The point of going to all this trouble is that people who don\'t care
about reality (and consistancy) can always simplify, but if you try
to make things like ship design systems, combat rules, etc, it is
nice to have it map to at least the first order expectations of
players who will notice.

As an aside, the notion that something like Star Wars (mentioned
before in this thread) is consistant is nonsense.  I can think of
numerous simple solutions to the plot that their physics allow that
wouldn\'t make the story as interesting.  ID4, as another example,
was incredibly stupid because the apparent goal of the aliens
(destruction) would have been better served by slamming a single
fighter (crewless) into each city at a high velocity.  Nobody with a
course in baby physics (or a few Novas) under their belt could
stomache that without griping.  The trick is that if you want a plot
like that, you need to at least say *why* they decided to hover
within F-18 range so it isn\'t as goofy.

Frankly, it frequently requires more imagination to pay out a harder
SF setting since you aren\'t allowed the thoughtless "\'cause that\'s
the way I say it works" easy out.

"The Return of Starbuck" was quite good as long as you ignored the
"frame" story. It was at leasty as good as any of the original BG
episodes.

Well, when I get it "done", I\'ll have to arrange for it to be on a web
page or at an FTP site. When I get that far, I\'ll post the sector name
data to the list, as folks will need that to be able to enter data in

That\'s because you assume that 4 AV 10 walls equal an AV 40 wall. 
I don\'t think it works that way.

If you double the mass you double the bang. But if you double the
*velocity* you quadruple the bang. Since the energy goes up linearly
with mass, but as the *square* of the velocity, the drives are very
much worthwhile.

I suspect that we\'ll eventually go to "chording" keyboards as they are
faster and smaller. The basic idea is that you have a small number of
keys or buttons, arranged for easy finger access and you "type" by
pressing *combinations* of keys. Thus the "chording".

Beside the fact that they are supposed to be as fast if not faster,
they are usable one handed, and only need to be a bit bigger than the
average hand.

You can also carry a device using one on your hip and take notes with
your hand at your side.

so he might have changed his mind about some of the stuff there, but the
thing that I found interesting was that hydrogen was only used to as
fuel and coolant for the fusion reactor, it didn\'t say anything about
needing it to open up a hole in space. Actually there was a pretty good
explanation for that too, but I don\'t want to cite the whole text.
Anyway he also mentioned using an antimatter plant or even solar power
to fuel the jump.

Not that this would change the game much though even if one would allow
this since antimatter plants don\'t appear until very high TL. And if you
don\'t want to give your players an ancient starship it shouldn\'t be too
much of a problem. The solar power shouldn\'t be too much problem either,
it just takes too long time to charge. What group of players would want
a ship which would have to wait perhaps several days to charge up the
jumpdrive.

*Any* ship in space in the "life zone" of a star is going to be at
around 300K on the sunlit side. If it is dark colored, it\'ll be hotter.
The dark side will be at a temp determined by a balance between the
internal temp (most electronics and the like are going to heat it
almost as much as life support) and the amount of heat it can radiate
to the 3K background of empty space.

The fusion plant is gonna be a major heat source, and we don\'t know
what kind of IR signature thrust plates have.

In any case, the ship *has* to be designed to maintain a certain
temp range to avoid temp effects on the components! Not very many items
work the same over large temp ranges.

It doesn\'t hurt anything. You can easily play the game with 3d sectors.
Only thing is, it makes maps messy, and navigation a *royal* pain. I
have looked at several "3d" maps from various games, and some "3d" star
displays. The maps are *very* hard to use. The displays on the computer
aren\'t much better, because it\'s hard to rotate them. (If anybody has a
source for a freely rotating "knob" that gives a digital 0-255 "angle"
readout at TTL levels, I\'d love to know the source. It must *not* have
a stop.)

So 2d *is* a simplification, but it doesn\'t affect anything except
playability. Playable 3d sectors (much less combat) require either 3d
*models* of the sectors, or computers.

First problem. The whole technique requires that you be able to take
the data from the sensors, process it, and get it to the emitters
*before* the wave you want to cancel gets there. Unfortunately, this
requires FTL wiring and signal processing gear.

We can cancel sound only because it is so much slower than the speed at
which signals travel through wires (which is considerably under c).

Second problem. The canceled waves wind up as heat.... :-)

Nope. You have to match the emitted waveform *exactly in phase,
frequency and amplitude. Otherwise you are *increasing* the emissions. 

Using a recording of previous emissions would be like trying to cancel

Again, it doesn\'t work that way. You have to emit a signal that
*exactly* matches the *waveform*. That means nanosecond by nanosecond.
It\'s not signal *strength* that you are matching.

I think you misunderstood what he is talking about. He\'s talking about
*wavelength*, not signal strength. Here\'s an analogous situation using
visible light. Even if they are the same "brightness", it\'s *damn* hard
to hide a red ship against a green backround.

That\'s what band sensitivity does for you. Different temperatures are
different colors. And it makes a big difference in what you can see. 

I\'m especially sensitive to the IR bit since one of the local TV
stations got a FLIR camera for their news chopper (the manufacturer is
a local company and gave them a great discount in exchange for getting
mentioned whenever they use it). Temperature differences make for
*marked* differences in visibility.

See my post about chording keyboards. One variety was developed from a
device Braille users use to type Braille quickly. And Braille has an
*extensive* shorthand. Level 1 Braille is spelling everything out.
Level 2 uses a Special prefix character and codes words and short
phrases. And Level 3 Braille encodes a *large* vocabulary. And all of
this is using 2x3 patterns of dots.

One of my "back burner" projects is to find an electronic copy of the
lebel 2 and level 3 Braille standards and use them for text
compression. After all, they are effectively using 6-bit characters.

So a combo of such shorthands and chording keyboards would *scream*.
Consider that court stenographers use a form of chording keyboard.

The Orion has a *much* higher Isp. I\'ll have to ask on another list
exactly how high, but it\'s enough higher that it has a negligible mass
ratio for an earth moon flight. It\'s also about the only currently
practical method of orbiting a million pond or better payload.

It\'s also well suited for a military vessel as the thrust plate has an
armor value that is simply ridiculous.

There was a story where someone (US, Russia, maybe even China) tried to
start World War III. They were stopped by *Canada*. The Canadaians had
secretly built the missile defense system from hell.

They\'d drilled shafts into mountainsides, stuck nuclear bombs at the
bottom and stuff rock, gravel, scrap metal etc into the shafts, on top
of a plug that acted like the wadding in a shotgun shell. The result
was a set of nuclear powered shotguns that wiped out all the missiles,
along with everything in LEO. And denied space to the world for the
next century or so do to all the space junk they\'d created and orbited.

If I ever get a copy of the design rules, access to the right reference
materials, and the time, I fully intend to design the various
spaceships that were proposed from WW II on. Start with the Sanger
antipodal bomber, then the Von Braun space program that Disney did the
films about in the early 50s (complete with wheel station and Earth
orbit rendevous lunar launch), and things like Dynasoar and the Manned
Orbiting Laboratory of the early sixties.

In other words *reasonable* designs for TL 5, 6, and 7 space vehicles.
They\'ll be handy for sticking in areas recovering from the Long Night,
or from the Virus and the Collapse.

I\'d like having explorers contact a civilzation that has made it to
another planet in their system (ie done a Mars expedition equivalent)
with 50s technology. 

Ditto for 60s tech. And Maybe even a planet with *30s/40s* tech that
has a moonbase.

Well, I figured that Radio should be broken down, simply because there
*are* bands that have decidely different propogation characteristics.

I also figured that sensor rules need to cover stuff besides tactical
uses. That\'s why I include UV and Gamma. Players may want to use them
to search for something.

I can see arguments both ways. But I\'d say that it\'d be best handled by
giving a table of emmisions versus power plant output. That would be
useful in *all* situations. It doesn\'t matter much whether you are
running at 100 MW because you are trying to hide or because it\'s all
your plant can put out. All that matters is output level and radiator
area.

Yeah. But I think that may be more complication than we *nedd*. Maybe

I agree about microwave. I missed that somehow. And I figured we needed

There should be gamma/xray "leakage" from the standard det laser
warheads. That gives the sensors a use in detecting "suspicious" energy
sources. And it may be useful for survey type applications.

Actually, even when I was in my heaviest "handwriting mode" back taking notes
furiously in nursing school, I could still type faster. I think its a combo
of just having very slow handwriting styles and a touch of arthritis that
typing disturbs less than writing does.

Good idea, I hadn\'t thought about shorthand. My mother can still write in it
from her days as a secretary, though she has to think about it a bit. I can
remember when I was a child that she could easily keep up with anyone who was
speaking (faster than, as you said, her rapid fire typing skills).

Computers evolve very quickly; I suspect our predictions of what things 
will be like in 4000 years time will be about as accurate as the IBM 
spokesman who, 40 years ago, said the world would never need more than 6 
computers...

A few thoughts:

- - the idea of having \'a computer\' will become meaningless. Everyone will 
have access to a global net 24 hrs a day, wherever they are, through 
something as small and common as a watch. Processing could take place on 
the other side of the world.

- - the idea of a \'user interface\' will become meaningless. Speech and 
handwriting recognition will be near enough 100% accurate, and the 
(pseudo) AI will be smart enough to deal with things like, \'book me a 
seat on the next shuttle to Tokyo\', \'is there anything good on TV 
tonight?\', or \'open the pod bay doors\'. Output will be projected onto 
the nearest available screen (including your glasses - or better still, 
directly onto your retina) or heard through a tiny speaker in an earring 
(or implanted).

	Certainly the space can be better used than by high explosives--put in
controls, engines and fuel so you have a faint chance of actually hitting
something. They\'ll add mass as well.

This relates very well to Space: 1889, of course, a game with more than enough room for 
the most erratic eccentricities.

	OK. I can buy that. But where the h*ll did it come from? The formula is in
there, but labelled Pen, not damage. And why is there a separate column
labelled "Traveller 4th ed. Damage" next to the column labelled "Traveller
4th ed. Penetration?"

	Agreed. Although I still think there\'s a fair chance that even small
weapons won\'t "blow-through." Bones do a fair job of deflecting bullets
inside the body to do more damage.

	See, I have the exact opposite opinion. I\'m an engineer and a gearhead,
but I have no trouble with imagination. I play both fantasy and science
fiction RPGs, but I do draw a line between them. If I wanted to play "space
fantasy" I\'d pick up Star Wars, which, incidentally, has a good degree of
internal self-consistency.

	To me, the lack of imagination comes in from people who whine "Oh, reality
won\'t let me do what I want." I\'d rather see what SCIENCE fiction lets me
do, and then apply my imagination to that. People who believe that
playability and realism are on the opposite ends of the spectrum are the
ones who seem to lack the imagination, IMHO. For Example: Larry Niven wrote
"The Ringworld." A bunch of gearheads at MIT sat down, and calculated that
it was unstable (it would fall into the sun if left alone), and stood in
the halls at a science fiction convention chanting that. He didn\'t chastise
them for THEIR lack of imagination, he applied HIS imagination to USE
reality to come up with a sequel. THAT\'S imagination--instead of turning
your back on a logical extension of what you\'ve decreed, USING it.

	And no, none of my players take malicious delight in "ruining" my game by
simply sticking to the rules as I\'ve laid them out. They expect a certain
degree of consistency. If I\'ve said something is possible, and they see a
way to use it, how the hell are they supposed to know that\'s not something
I\'D bothered to think about? That\'s my fault, not theirs. They\'re simply
trying to play within my universe.

	Please, nobody take this as a personal flame; my opinion only. OTOH, if
you really must, go right ahead and flame me personally (not the list). I\'m
fully capable of surviving it.

I keep looking for and at werwolf figures from, maybe, Vampire or Shadowrun, but they

RAFM was doing a good job with TNE figures.

Well, come on, it was war time.  You have to maintain your humanity somehow, even if

Oh! I C now!  I was just multiplying meters to centemeters without

Thanx for pointing that out.  Well now we can officialy rule out grav
powered handguns, but there are still rifles we can use.  Ok, now i
think i sparked som attention, I will tell y\'all the idea we had last
night.  Me and Agent Shien wanted to develop a remote controlled grav
powered weapon.  You could let go of the thing and it would continue to
float in someones face, or you could control it with a HUD-smartlink, vr
gloves or by an aide to the comm-unit on the weapon, (subvocalization). 
The idea was to make the enemy believe u were using psi ability.  Not to
mention it would have been cool as hell!

Now it is PROVEN by rules law that this is not posible, the gun\'d be to
danged heavy or large.

But theres always RC drones and poilce robots! :)

But Traveller is a Science FICTION game, and in fiction you can do a lot
you can\'t do in fact. And the people I game with has the attitude that if
they can\'t win, or at least break even, then they\'ll quit the game ;-).

I\'d like to point out that using a parallel dimension as a heat sink
wouldn\'t violate the law of conservation of energy. The energy isn\'t
destroyed, it\'s just move to another place. Yet if that would really
allow for perpetuum mobiles (how?) then it wouldn\'t be any good for
the Traveller universe.

Not nescessarily. I never said cancel out. I said reduce.

That, if possible, would cancel it out. However, the purpose of the masking
is reduction.

For example, the cooling system of a vessle needs hull space to dispose of
the heat it carries off. This hull space will produce bright spots. There
are a number of methods of reducing bright spots (directional scattering via
faceted sections, large surface area, etc). The infrared countersignal would
simply be one additional method to add to the above.

EM masking for a vessle is a complicated process. Even in present day, IR
reduction is a complex combination of eliminating the heat in the first
place and scattering heat that remains. I would imagine that in Milenu 0, it
is just as complicated, but doable. It cannot be said that just because a
vessle has a power plant of x magnitude that it can be seen at f(x) distance
if it is built with the idea of not being seen easily.

I\'m working on a system where blow-through levels are based on the mass of
the creature.. 51-100kg would be 3d, and so on.. When it\'s done, I\'ll post
it along with my other combat fixes.

OK, please explain how. It\'s not that I doubt you, it\'s that I don\'t
understand how that would work. I would have thought that having a hole
where you can pour in energy, but not take it out again, would result
in a net energy loss. I can\'t understand how you can turn that into an
energy-producing gizmo.

extending it.

How about an extremely efficient heat storage device? I know that that will
also give you extremely efficient energy storage, which is why I didn\'t
suggest it before, but can it be adjusted not to break other parts of
the Traveller technology?

(And, btw., how long can you "mask" a starship using it\'s capacitors as a
heat storage device?)

Actually, even though it sounds like it, that is not exactly the method I
was refering to.

The sensors along the hull detect the signals over time, and compares them
with a database of typical produced signals for that operation situation. If
there is a change over time, and especially if it a change that is different
than expected, then the signal out can be modified.

I take it you\'re not a rap fan.

Neither am I :)

Actually it\'s frequency, amplitude, and 180 degrees out of phase. Since we
are talking about an application to a tech problem several centuries into
the future, we can assume that tech exists that can emit IR signals of a
specific hertz, magnitude, and phase without a heat based emiter, such as a
broad band low power EM emiter tuned to emit with that signature. Would
still need power, but would not become a very bright spot.

But since you did mention increasing emissions, it gave me the idea for
using this method for another purpose. If you are a small military courier,
for example, and wnated to be left alone in potentially hostile area, you
could tune your IR signiature to be equal to that of a battleship.

	Remember that Traveller:1965 campaign idea I floated a while back?
I actually got some timeline work done on it (I\'m up to the early 1950\'s),
and have gone snooping around the Web for inspiration.  You might really
enjoy Mark Wade\'s Encyclopaedia of Manned Spaceflight web page.  Lotsa good
stuff there.  The T65 campaign is backburnered for the moment (Ross has got
some wierd StoryTeller-based thing set in the 20\'s planned for
spring/summer; I\'m betting Cthulhu, personally) but I\'d like to get it
finished and into play at some point...

	If you want to collaborate on any design work, let me know.  My
last exam is May 2nd, and after that I\'m fleeing the groves of academe for
good (yay!) and will have time on my hands to devote to this kind of stuff.

	And what was the Sanger antipodal bomber?

Hello,
	I\'ve been thinking about the positional variation when doing a jump.  It
lead me to believe that there should be a time uncertainty as well.  It
would be interesting to note that the typical jump takes 1 week, then their
should be a consistent uncertainty of time involved.  If the time
uncertainty is plus or minus a day, then the strategies associated with an
attack on another system become very different from massing the fleet,
jumping, and attacking any enemy vessels.  This implies a need for very
large ships carrying smaller attack craft through the jump. It would be
interesting to hear what the list-members think.  If this thread has already
been done to death in the past, I apologize in advance.

Nope. Not anymore.

The marketing wizards decided that this "pigeonholed" the technology too

digital stuff we can throw into them.

The "official" meaning of the acronym is now Digital Versatile Disk.

1 cm = 0.01 m

Therefore: 1 cu. cm = 0.01 m x 0.01 m x 0.01 m = 0.000001 cu. m
       and 0.01 m^3 = 10,000 cm^3

So... the density is 0.65 g/cm^3. Damn thing floats! Maybe it\'s broken in

Actually, the rule states that "no character can suffer any more than
3D damage"-- the weapon itself can still deliver more than that,
however (reduced by armour and other stuph).

Hello,
	I\'ve been thinking about the positional variation when doing a jump.  It
lead me to believe that there should be a time uncertainty as well.  It
would be interesting to note that the typical jump takes 1 week, then their
should be a consistent uncertainty of time involved.  If the time
uncertainty is plus or minus a day, then the strategies associated with an
attack on another system become very different from massing the fleet,
jumping, and attacking any enemy vessels.  This implies a need for very
large ships carrying smaller attack craft through the jump. It would be
interesting to hear what the list-members think.  If this thread has already
been done to death in the past, I apologize in advance.

Yeah, the Cmdr pointed that out yesterday. ;-> OTOH, it was his funky

Hee!  It\'s not like I never make mathmatical errors.  Like I was telling
one of my students yesterday, "Elementary Statistics was the most
interesting course I ever had to take...twice times." ;->

The "pseudo-science" vs "total-handwaving" argument going on right now is
hard on me.  It would be *so* much easier for me handwave everything and
tell the players, "I don\'t know why, it just IS!", but my deeply repressed
gearhead nature rebels at doing anything without a reasonable explanation. 
I also know the kind of players I have, if  something stretches their
suspension of belief past the breaking point they get silly and the game
goes straight to hell. ;-)

How?  Well, if a dimension exists that you can flood with your
unwanted heat energy an keep it there, by the same logic the reverse
should be possible by drawing energy out of another dimension.  The
occupants of that dimension might complain a little :)

Cool, I like the ref that extrapolates from Traveller future history
instead of some contemporary furure historians. I see Solomani ahead in the
military TLs, computer TLs but lacking in math, biology and especially in
biology, law, etchics that the contemporary Solomani doesn\'t even consider
TL related items.

  I think the "shielding detectors" concept won\'t fly, simply
because the detectors don\'t interfere with the neutrinos.  That
said, however, you also will be swamped by stellar background
and unable to figure out someones location in anything like
reasonable parameters.  Also, the Book 8 sensor is an order
of magnitude or two too small for the best theoretical model
we can imagine.

Well beside the fact that pentiums etc are TL 6 TL (RISC is 1980+ and Intel
doesn\'t have any) I like your progression. What is lackin though is
innovation. If Robots are reasonable at TL 12+ (Robots supplement) then
robotic like reasoning will be common at TL 12+ ie:
Sir Charles sits down at his desk and asks "Who\'d want to fry my ass so
hard they\'d risk life at Mithras?"
"Five pointed star, Mr Rappahalladran and most of the high ranking police
representatives in this subsector" a not at all metallic sounding grille in
the wall responds."


The evolution in computers (as in most other important tech is either tech
driven if military important or innovation driven as in computers. Most
people tech literate people are aware aware of the big technological
deficiences of the Intel architecture of CPUs ut it\'s still a big seller in
the market. The same could be said about displays; everybody knoes that
active matrix, plasma screens are far superior to cathode tubes in quality,
volume, radioation but manufacturers keep churning them out as they fear
the retooling costs.
I see WIMP (windows, icons, menus intyerfaces prevailing until reliable
voice input comes along at TL 8-9+ and this will be superseded by
personality sim interfaces at TL 12+ (strikingly to the intelligent agents
stuff that tech ignoramuses are so fond of today).

Information density has never been a factor for when the biz zombies will
start to do stuff.
Info density wenat high enough during the turn of the previous century but
as economical/business interactions are social any tech improvement will be
important first when a tongue-sphincter interaction will be simulated whith
enough fidelity that both the brown-nose and the asshole will feeel as
such;)

I think you were probably joking, but I wasn\'t.  I recall seeing an
analysis of the code written for these computers (in assembler, by IBM).
The cost came out to just a little bit more than $1M per line of code in
the finished product.

Well, I wonder then whether IG is more interested in the small core of old
dedicated players or in expanding to a larger group of customers in the
future.  The former group is vocal and willing to pay for new products, the
latter is much larger, not tied to any particular canon, and _potentially_
more lucrative if tapped correctly.

In print, you\'re probably right.  This is a pretty good reason to stay with
the 2D maps too.  OTOH, games like Ascendancy show that this same
limitation doesn\'t exist in software...

We presume that there exists a hole in the wall of your reactor room which
leads to a parallel universe, into which you want to dump IR.  Given the
nature of waste heat, you do this by putting a big radiator in front of
it, and pumping your cooling fluid through it, allowing the heat to
radiate into the hole.

Now, being a one-way gate to a parallel universe, we derive that the hole
has an effective temperature of 0 K.  So, I replace my working fluid with
liquid helium.  I use the radiator as my condenser, let the cosmic 3 K
background warm it up in an evaporator nearby, and place a paddlewheel in
the condenser drain path.  Not perpetual, perhaps, but that paddlewheel
will continue turning as long as the cosmic microwave background persists,
and generate power in the process.

The problem is that you need to dump waste heat into something less hot
than the source, and any small reservoir will come up to equilibrium
temperature quickly; nothing has a high enough specific heat to \'eat\'
fusion waste heat at GW levels for long, *and* fit inside a starship.

You can\'t do that at all.

    'body' => 'This realism vs. freewheeling debate is intriguing.  Time to throw some
more gasoline on the fire...

First off, I object to the assertion that players who find and exploit
unintended consequences of new tech/physics are "intentionally breaking
the game," or that this behavior is confined to rules-lawyering munchkins.
Any good (to me) RPG scenario can be construed as a series of puzzles or
challenges, some of broad scope ("how can I clear my family\'s name and
regain the Barony of Kachara?"), some of narrow scope ("how can I get past
this alert guard and into the conference room?"), all interwoven into a
narrative structure.

A good player, confronted with a challenge, brings to bear *all* of his or
her experience with the game world, and with the real world to the extent
it applies.  A good GM, setting up challenges, must both provide a few
well-prepared paths to success, and be prepared to wing it if the players
come up with something different.  The dilemma occurs when a player quite
rightly and innocently uses their game-world knowledge to solve a problem
in a way that ruins the game.

For example:  As the GM, you have contrived to put your players on a world
with a hostile low-tech populace, in a ship with broken m-drives, no
operational weapons, but a functional power plant.  On a mountaintop
nearby, visible from the landing site, is the wood-and-stone shell keep of
the local overlord, whose skirmish parties are getting bolder and bolder
at probing the downed ship\'s area.  Your model for the scenario is that
the players will be forced to parley with the natives, or sneak away from
the ship at night, or fight the locals with their meager small arms.

Then one of your players recalls your hand-waved explanation of IR stealth
from the previous session.  "Hey," she says, "didn\'t you say that our IR
cloaking system could beam waste heat from the reactor off in one
direction?"  You gulp and nod as a broad grin blooms on her face, then the
other players\'.  "OK, we aim the waste-heat beam at that nice dry wooden
keep.  Engineer, crank the fusion-plus unit up to \'roast\', please."

Result:  One wrecked scenario.  Your choices as GM?

(1) Say \'no\'.  This destroys the players\' faith in your world, and hence
    the joy of the game.  It also reduces the players\' confidence that you
    will reward clever solutions, a very bad trend in any game.

(2) Say \'yes\'.  Your careful preparations are out the window.  You either
    ad lib your way through an entirely unplanned adventure (GM hell), or
    tell everybody to go home half an hour after the session started, so
    you can prepare the new paths.  This doesn\'t lead to happy players.

All this from one casually hand-waved, seemingly harmless and irrelevant
piece of technology.  Almost *any* change to the background can cause
scenarios like this.  And notice that this is not munchkin behavior; I\'d
call the player creativity above very good role-playing.

The objection was raised that literary SF is free to use hypertech and to
be inconsistent.  True, but in literature the author can *control* every
thought and action of every character in the book.  If there are
inconsistencies, and the author isn\'t aware of them, neither will the
characters be.  If he *is* aware of them, he can avoid them on purpose.
Similarly with hypertech; an author can control the characters, and
project into them full knowledge of their society and technology; you
can\'t do that with players.

  Consider how disorienting a book like "Neuromancer" or "Use of Weapons"
is on the first reading; part of the reader\'s pleasure is in gradually
figuring out what\'s going on.  That can\'t work in an RPG, unless you use
the tired old "20th Century people carried into the 57th by
stasis/relativity/whatever" plot, which is also a staple of lit. SF so
there\'ll be somebody as dumb as the reader to lecture at.

   Well there was another project developed by the Americans which
involved bats carrying incendiaries.  The plan was that the bats would
be released over Japan, fly into wooden structures on the ground looking
for a dark place to nest and instead would start fires.  During testing
of the concept in New Mexico, a number of the bats got loose and burned
down several building on an Army Air Corps base.  The project was
eventually dropped however when another project was given the go ahead
for production instead--the atomic bomb.

   Nuking saved the lives of countless bats, pigeons, and other small
furry and feathery creatures.  So the next time somebody starts talking
some anti-nuke jibberish, tell them that you favor thermonuclear weapons
because you are an animal rights activist.

Attributes: 

Roll the attributes as for a Chirper.  For a Droyne, select the caste 
and then add the listed modifiers.

                 ---- Droyne Castes ----

 PSI    1D6+1     +/-0      +/-0    +1D6       +/-0     +1D6/2   +1D6/2 

(For example):  Roll 1D6/2 +1D6 for a Sport\'s STR, roll 1D6+2 +1D6/2 for 
a Sport\'s AGL, and so on.   

As a result of career gains, an attribute can be raised, at most, two
points above the original value, but in no case above the racial maximum of
15 (F).  

Instead of SOC, Droyne and Chirper characters have the pseudo-attribute
Caste (CST).  This attribute specifies the caste to which the character
belongs, and thus can never be changed once chosen.  Chirpers have CST 0,
Workers have CST 1, Warriors have CST 2, Drones have CST 3, Technicians
have CST 4, Sports have CST 5, and Leaders have CST 6.  

Default Skills:

All Chirper and Droyne characters have Flying 0, Homing 0, Invisibility 0,
and Willpower 0.  Depending on the character\'s homeworld, the character may
also have the usual additional Default skills (Computer 0, Pilot (Grav) 0,
etc.).  

Background Skills:

A Chirper character can have whatever four appropriate Background skills
the player wants, subject, as usual, to GM approval.  Droyne character have
specific Background skills based on caste.

Worker Caste: 3x (Animal Handling, Artisan, or Engineer) 2, Service 2.  
Warrior Caste: Acrobat 2, (Archaic Weapons or Gun Combat) 2, Armed Martial
  Arts 2, Unarmed Martial Arts 2.  
Drone Caste: Instruction 2, Liaison 2, Philosophy/Theology 2, Service 2.  
Technician Caste: 4x (Artisan or Technician) 2.  
Sport Caste: Acrobat 2, Explore 2, Luck 2, Willpower 2.  
Leader Caste: Admin/Legal 2, Deduction/Analysis 2, Leadership 2, Liaison 2.  

Career Generation and Resolution:

Droyne and Chirpers begin career generation at age 12 (not 17), using the
standard four-year terms.  The number of skills they receive per term is
the usual for the term number.  

Chirper
(All Terms):
Skills: Acrobat, Animal HAndling, Charm, Explore, Interaction.  
Special: 9+ for Gun Combat, Melee, Perception, Psionics, Technician.  
Promotion: 9+, no DMs.  
Other: None.  

Worker
(All Terms):
Skills: Animal Handling, Artisan, Engineer, Service, Technician, +1 STR, 
  +1 AGL, +1 CON.  
Special: 9+ for Acrobat, Melee, Psionics, Vehicle.  
Promotion: 9+, no DMs.  
Other: None.  

Warrior
(All Terms):
Skills: Acrobat, Gun Combat, Melee, Tactics, Vehicle.  
Special: 7+ for Archaic Weapons, Artillery, Heavy Weapons, Medical,
  Perception, Personal Transport, Psionics, Spacehand, +1 STR, +1 AGL, 
  +1 CON.  
Promotion: 7+, no DMs.  
Other: None.  

Drone
(All Terms):
Skills: Charm, Interaction, Psionics, Social Science.  
Special: 8+ for Acrobat, Economics, Fine Arts, Medical, Perception, 
  +1 EDU, +1 CHR, +1 PSI.  
Promotion: 6+, no DMs.  
Other: None.  

Technician
(All Terms):
Skills: Artisan, Physical Science, Space Tech, Technician.  
Special: 7+ for Acrobat, Engineer, Perception, Psionics, Space Tech,
  Spacehand, +1 INT, +1 EDU.  
Promotion: 7+, no DMs.  
Other: None.  

Sport
(All Terms):
Skills: Acrobat, Charm, Determination, Explore, Interaction, Perception,
  Space Vessel.  
Special: 5+ for any skill (including Psionics), +1 INT, +1 CHR.  
Promotion: 8+, no DMs.  
Other: One ship DM per Special for a Scout.  

Leader
(All Terms):
Skills: Charm, Determination, Economics, Interaction, Perception, Social
  Science, Tactics, +1 INT, +1 CHR.  
Special: 7+ for any skill (including Psionics), +1 EDU.  
Promotion: 7+, no DMs.  
Other: Three ship DMs per term for a Scout.  

Money:

Chirpers get just the basic amount for the homeworld Tech Level for each
term of service (i.e., as though they had a SOC of 1).  

For Droyne, add together the character\'s rank number and the number of
terms served.  Multiply this number by the character\'s CST, and then
multiply this number by the basic amount for the homeworld Tech Level.  

This money is *not* available as cash.  Instead, the Droyne or Chirper can
have equipment whose total value doesn\'t exceed this monetary amount.  

Aging: 

Begin checking for losses of STR, AGL, and CON starting at age 20 (after
only two terms), and for losses of INT at age 52 (after 10 terms).  Sports
and Leaders receive a DM +3.  

Unusal Skills: 

Droyne and Chirpers almost never have the skills Bribery, Forgery,
Gambling, and Streetwise.  

New Skills:

Deduction/Analysis (INT) -- Perception: This skill allows a character to
piece together facts into a related whole.  This skill is a combination of
the skill Deduction from a back issue of _The_Traveller_Chronicle_ [TTC]
and the skill Intelligence Analysis presented a while ago on the TML by
someone else.  

Flying (CON) -- Acrobat, Personal Transport: This skill lets the Droyne or
Chirper make use of mechanical wings.  This skill is from AM5:Dr.  

Homing (PSI) -- Clairsentience/Teleperception: This psionic Talent lets the
Droyne or Chirper find its way back to its community.  This Talent is from
AM5:Dr.  

Invisibility (PSI) -- Telepathy/Telereception: This psionic Talent allows
the Droyne or Chirper to cloud the minds of men, evil chuckle not included.
This Talent is from AM5:Dr.  

Luck (INT) -- Determination: This skill is from a back issue of TTC (the
same one as Deduction, above), as well as from GDW\'s Dark Conspiracy.  This
skill acts as TNE\'s version of Jack-Of-All-Trades.  

Philosophy/Theology (EDU) -- Social Science: This skill is used by Droyne
for their coyn-casting ceremonies.  This skill is otherwise identical to
the version presented in T4.  It is used instead of the new skill
Prediction from AM5:Dr.  

Modified Skills:

Liaison: This skill is used by Droyne as normal.  It\'s also used to cross
caste barriers, instead of using the new skill Appeal from AM5:Dr.

 I\'m not going to comment about maths (because I\'m sure someone else
will), or law and ethics (which are _not_ a technological achievement or
capability - despite what Civ tells you :), but biology? Firstly, the
Solomani have a massive advantage over almost every other human race in
the Traveller universe when it comes to biology, simply because we\'re
actually _related_ to the other species sharing our planet. This means
that the principles you discover from working on animals (in anatomy, for
example) can actually be applied to humans, and vice versa. [This is
actually part of Traveller canon - the Solomani are biotech geniuses
compared to the Vilani]

 Secondly, it\'s simply untrue that we don\'t consider biology (or rather,
_biotechnology_) to be a "TL-related item". Just search the newspapers for
news of Daisy the cloned nazi sheep for evidence of this :)

 [Traveller, being based on the SF of the 60\'s and 70\'s largely ignores
biotechnology, because the field hadn\'t "taken off" back then. Now of
course we have a whole field of SF devoted to the miracles and nightmares
of biotech-dominated futures...]

 Because most english-language SF is written by people who live in (gasp)
democracies, and have been told from day one that it is both the (morally)
best (least worst?) and most efficient form of government.

Ah yes, but what if the only parallel universe(s) we can interact with have
the same 3k background as ours, having been formed by the "big-bang" at the
same time?  In this case, you can radiate your heat into the other universe
and perhaps draw energy out of it too, but in neither case would it be
being created or destroyed, nor would there be any danger of a "perpetual
motion machine."  All you\'d be doing is shifting mass or energy from one
part of the mega-verse to another.  Shoot, you could create your own little
pocket universes for this purpose, sort of like Grandpop did.  Of course,
IIRC, manipulating pocket universes is up around TL 25 isn\'t it?  ;->

So you\'re going to have a non-interactive detector that gives you
direction as well as energy for the neutrino?  I was under the
impression that neutrino detectors were based on inverse beta decay,
am I wrong here?

I guess I don\'t see how you interact with a neutrino without
interacting with it, I guess.

I was actually thinking more from a directional sense than
absorbtion within the detector.  You could get a direction from
something like a bubble chamber, but this implies an interaction,
no?

Background is indeed a problem----and I\'d be interested in a decent
reference for neutrino detectors (it\'s been a while since quantum

I can tell you that based on our technology today why IR are inferior
missiles.  First of all they are completely Line of sight (LOS) only, and
this is a major problem for ground based missiles.  And although we are
improving the ability to filter out most decoys, it is still pretty easy to
fool an IR missile.  They are very susceptable to sun glint off of just about
anything, including clouds. Once the lock is broken it has to be manually
reaquired.  There aren\'t many air-to-air missiles that I can think of that
are effective in todays arsenal.

 OTOH I don\'t see these factors having the same effect in space because the
LOS is pretty much wide open unless you are in an asteroid belt or near a
planet (very near).  There aren\'t many things to get sun glint off of in deep
space either, not to  mention that background space being substantially
cooler that the target as has been rehashed.  Flares of some sort would still
be the primary means of fooling the missile (IMO) but at high TL they would
be pretty much foolproof I speculate.  There most probably will be some
mechanism to attempt to reaquire lock if contact is broken.  They are
developing missiles today that have ever increasing coasting abilities that
can relock after a substantial time.  With the distances involved in space
and flight time and fuel conservation in zero gravity coasting times could
big HUGE.  Evasion will still be an end-game/last-ditch maneuver to be
effective.  

Seems viable to me that IR missiles should be pretty damn effective in space
combat.

two reasons:

1) You want at least *some* chance to defend yourself against the

2) You can use it as a cutting tool to deal with wrecked ships (e.g.,
   creating entry holes in a mangled hull).

Anyway, hope somebody finds this useful!

One thing I suggest is that if a character rolls 3 or more sixes on a task,

spectacular failure. Without this rule highly skilled characters cannot
fail most tasks normally, only spectacularly. With this rule highly skilled

One other suggestion I have, Kenneth, is that you submit KBv2.0 to JTAS. If

Wouldn\'t a spy already have a neutrino detector and not need a license to
get one?

However, I do agree that neutrino detectors should be manditory for
military vessels. The ability to detect fusion plants at interplanetary
distances is so useful I can\'t understand why they aren\'t included in all
military sensor packages. The rules seem to ignore them completely except
for some mention about "analysing the fusion process of stars" or
something.

In my campaign neutrino sensors have poor resolution, about 45 degrees of
arc, but are very small and require low power (since I haven\'t allocated
space or power for them in ship designs!) They are used to scan for bogeys
in a system. If a suspicious neutrino source is detected the ship maneuvers
and uses other sensors to get a weapon lock. This way ships can quickly
decide whether to go to battle stations or continue with their missions.

This is a cool idea, but I don\'t understand why a jumping ship would make a
"huge gravity wave". Does it get more massive or what? Wouldn\'t this have
unpleasant side effects on the crew and passengers? Gravity wave detectors
would probably be useful for detecting contra-grav or thruster plates, but
I don\'t see why jump drive would have such an effect. Someone please
enlighten me if I am wrong.

events (the chlorine 37 detectors that live in salt mines most
people know about).

These are still interactions, albeit small ones.  How directional is
this detector, BTW?

Actually, since at traveller TLs they have direct strong and weak
force control, couldn\'t this be used for detection (or shielding)?
I don\'t really have a mental picture of how this would work, but
somebody else might...

Oh, sure. You\'re players weren\'t being munchkins, they were being smart,
being creative.  Just the sort of players I *like* too!   

But, I DO agree with you about simply handwaving explanations.  The GM has
to do the best he can to maintain an internally consistant universe for his
players. If I allowed this IR beamer to exist, and I wouldn\'t, then I\'d
have to live with the consequences, and that means I\'d have to think it
out.  I\'ve always been blessed with players that *help* me with that..one

The reasoning about these computers was sound, to ensure they where imune to radiation and 
magnetic forces. In practice, i dont know. NASA seems to try to push yesterday\'s technolagy 
for tomorrow.

Great.  Please let me know how it goes and what your players think.

I disagree.  Highly skilled characters should have a small chance of 
failure--after all, they are highy skilled and know what the heck 
they are doing.

These characters can still roll over their target numbers for a 
regular failure.  And, if you change the 3 sixes to regular failure, 
what will you do for SF?

With the probability of SF being--

 Probability of SF
 
 Difficulty                    SF%
 ----
 Easy                          0.00
 Average                    0.46
 Difficult                      1.54
 Formidable                 3.22
 Staggering                 5.36
 Impossible                  7.81



I think that the % chance is not too high (or low) even if rolled by 
a character with high skill.

Besides, a high level character\'s % chance of SS will go up based on 
his skill level.  In this way, SS/SF is affected by a character\'s 
skill.

Yes, I\'ve been thinking about that.  I\'ve also got some Traveller 
short stories that I\'ve been thinking about submitting also.

Just for your information, I have submitted KBv2.0 to Marc Miller for 
the revised edition of T4.

I submitted it to him before it hit the list several months back, but 
I didn\'t hear back from him.

I wanted some direction from him to ensure that KBv2.0 went in the 
direction that Marc would want in a task system.

I had heard from him on some other issues, and he had told me before 
that he wanted to get rid of the half die in the Book 1 system.  
Since I agreed completely with that, that\'s where I brainstormed to 
get KBv2.0 to.

But, when I didn\'t hear back from him when I submitted the idea for 
KBv2.0, I decided to head it out on my own.  Direction from Marc 
Miller or no, I was determined to fix the problems with the T4 task 
system.  I knew if I worked on it long enough, it could be done.

What I posted the other night is the completed version.  I\'ve since 
decided to give Marc another try.  The first post I sent him was an 
outline for an idea--the framework I hung KBv2.0 on.  This recent 
second post is the completed task system.

I hope to hear from him, but I\'m not holding my breath.  With or 
without Marc, I\'ve got a good task system for my game, and I\'ve 
litterally gotten e-mails in the high double digits supporting the 
work I\'ve done on the system.

This tells me, even though there are some vocal detractors, that 
several people like KBv2.0 and are using it.  

It is nice to get a pat on the back when you\'ve done something good.  
I do hope that KBv2.0 will become the new T4 task system, but even if 
it doesn\'t, its growing into the unofficial system of choice for 
many.

The fact that I like it is enough for me.  I\'m ecstatic that so many 
others  like it as much as I do.

Kenneth.

It\'s not minaturization to that level that I was refering, it\'s things like
tiny cellphones that have keypads too small for anyone with bigger than
average finger to use easily (me). I don\'t know about anywhere use, but down
here in New Zealand they\'re marketed as being better than older models
because they\'re smaller.

The other thing is that in a starfaring culture (assuming cheap travel)
there\'d be far less economic pressure to minaturize, and the break even
point between materials costs and minaturization costs would be closer to
the \'large\' end of the scale.

    'body' => 'I\'ve got some more sheets that some of you might be interested in.  

This one is an ammo sheet for slug throwers that you can use to keep 
track of ammo usage.  It\'s sometimes hard to remember just how many 
rounds you fired from your gauss rifle last game session.  You know 
you still had some left in the clip, but for exactly how many, you 
haven\'t got a clue.  Since you can\'t remember, it must be a full 
clip.

It\'s magical how players all of a sudden have completely full 
weapons.  Those scratch sheets that they use to keep track of how 
many rounds they have always seem to get thrown away at the end of 
the night.

I designed this sheet just for this purpose.  It\'s got 9 clips listed 
on the front, and I always print on the back too--allowing a 
character one sheet for 18 clips.

Each magazine is grouped into threes, so you can keep ammo for the 
same weapon grouped together.

And, each magazine is detailed, so that you can record all the 
pertinent details about the ammunition.

I designed this sheet when I was still using the TNE rules, so this 
may be a little more detail than you want for your T4 game.  But, 
I\'ve found that it works just fine in mine now that I\'ve converted to 
the T4 rules.  Besides, you can always leave spaces blank if you 
don\'t want that much detail about the clip.

Each magazine includes blanks for:

Type of weapon and TL

Type of round (HEAP, DS, HE, Ball, DSAP, etc)

Wt per round in grams (in case encumbrance is ever an issue in 
combat.  This was easy to list from the TNE info.  If you are using 
T4 like I am, you can leave it blank)

Wt of empty magazine (guass rifles have a battery in their mags, so 
they are heavy.  Auto-pistol mags are light.)

Wt of full magazine (in most games, you want to know this--its part 
of your character\'s combat load.)

Mag Capacity (list how many rounds are in a full mag)

Current Capacity (large space for running total--keep track of how 
many rounds are currently in the gun).

This sheet is spaced to allow hole punches on the side--all of my 
players keep their characters in a hard bound three ring binder.  
I\'ve found that using such a sheet makes recording keeping easier, it 
looks nice and is Travelleresque in design, and it facilitates 
keeping track of ammo usage when characters switch ammo types and 
magazines in the middle of a fight.  All a player has to do in this 
case is starting taking the ammo from another clip when he fires.  

You can always easily see how many rounds are in a specific clip at a 
glance because of the running totals, and it\'s easy to reference 
weight and encumbrance when three out of four characters are down and 
the remaining has to grab what he can before he leaves that area to 
save his skin.

Out of respect for those who get the TML in digest format, I\'m not 
posting this sheet to the list as an attachment.

If you want it, then send me an e-mail asking me for it.  It\'s in 
Word v2.0, and I\'ll get it right out to you.

Kenneth.

How about:

Neutrino detectors (though handwaving nuclear damper-related) principles
intersept approximately .1% of the neutrinos which intersect the sensor.
The detector registers both the number of the neutrinos and their
direction (through some cloud chamber-like mechanism).  So, the detectors
can sense high neutrino concentrations and give their direction (and
distance through triangulation). 

Other options are possible, but this one works for me.

I would assume Norris was gay because he liked men "that way" and did
not like women "that way" :)

If what you meant was "Why did someone at GDW make Norris gay ?" I have
no idea.  It could be that they wanted to point out that it was a viable
orientation that would still be with us in the far future, or it could
have just been that someones female PC tried to seduce Norris in an
early playtest session & they needed a good reason for it to fail.  If
anyone knows the answer please tell us.

It was a statement that was qualified in a way that i had to respond. It was not intended as

Let clarify things a bit. I am not arguing to trash the laws of physics. I am concerned 
however that in the march of realism that people are exhibiting here. I have no problems with 
rules vehical design or starship design or technolagy development, as they serve a purpose as 
a common ground , a reference point for the RPG universe. These rules serve the basis of the 
games "bible, not unliek what is seen in Star Trek and Bab5. 
 
 
But when people say that "fighters are useless, because they can not work in the real world", 
are missing the point. (this is just an example mind you). Traveller ALWAYS (sice CT Book 4 
high guard) had fighters, they have allways been a valid paltform for space navys. This shows 
that while they may have a better grasp of physics thanme, they ignore the fact that a lot of 
the traveller technolagy is based on items that dont excist, cant excist or shouldnt excist. 
 
The reason they are there : bacause they would be fun to have. 
 
 
I have no problems of people sitting down, and say "Hey this is cool, lets justify it", than 
to say "We cant use this cool idea, the rules bar us". I came accross this problem with VDS 
when i found there was no reaction drives for space propulsion (I wanted to do a GUNDAM for 
the Terran Federation). I can live with this as Greg and Mark has said that fighters only 
become viable at TL12 Imperial space. Still, i felt disapointed.

Who said I wanted fantasy. If I did I will play Ars Magica. What I want is an coherant system 
that allows me to role play a science fiction setting. Traveller does that for me. VDS & QSDS  
allow me to introduce technolagy which i can be sure fits the background (even if the systems 
are broken in some places).

What if it unfeasable to construct a metal ship due to lack of resources or culteral reasons? 
What if they find a tree sap that is lighter, sturdier and more utalitarian than any metal. 
What if they find a way to grow crystals cheaply (like Neal Stephenson\'s Diamond Age). This 
too is science fiction, and should not be disregarded because it does not conform with western 
consumer technological patterns.

Huh? Traveller is bigger than you and me (and even Marc Miller, when he walked away from GDW). 
It is everyones. The whole point of my whole post is that Traveller is not a gearheads 
microcosm of technolagy, nor a space opera clash. Its both and more. We shoudl not limit it in 
any way, we should encourage it. Your vision of Traveller is correct. So is mine. So is Guy\'s, 
Dave Golden\'s, Joe Heck\'s and Dave Nielson\'s.

I have seen games (not of traveller , thank god) where the GM hands out scrips of wha he 
expects his characters to do for that session. I have also seen a wild improvisation fall on 
its face or be startling successful. Remeber something Greg Porter wrote in CORPS (2nd Ed) 
, that there are 4 methods of doing something, the 3 the GM thinks are possable and the 4th is 
what the players actually do.  
 
If someone in my game comes up with a sudgestion which i feels is valid (even though i knwo 
nothing about it) I would generally allow it unless it is dramaticly appropiate to dissallow 
it (since on of the best sci fi player I know is a rule-lawyer/electrocics engineer, it is 
usually the safest way) or he stuffs up the skill roll anyway (which is alarmly regualr with 
this guy). 
 
One point, the characters know more about the Traveller Universe than you and I wil ever 
know. Its there world, we just get to see into it once and a while

I thought that to observe something you had to interfere with it, so
anything that can detect a neutrino signature would at least distort it.

I think that\'s because GDW felt that a neutrino detector that could find a
ship\'s fusion plant would be stoo big to be useful. They mention this
somewhere (Challenge perhaps) in an article on TNE space combat.

A ship entering or leaving jumpspace would change the gravity \'pattern\' of
the whole solar system. I suspect that the near instantaneous \'creation\' of
1000+ tons of matter would be fairly easily detectable over almost any
amount of background noise. Does anyone with a stronger grounding in physic
wish to hazard an opinion? This could have substantial impact on warship
design and tactics in my new campaign.

Actually TNE and FF&S didn\'t push back laser TL\'s much, thay just made them
damn heavy before TL13, and limited in ammo at TL13+. What they did do was
turn them into specialised weapons by dumping on their rigid armour penetration.

Thanks for the compliment. 

I\'ve always felt that the Solomani had very good materials technology,
because of the speed at which they developed J-3 Drives and because of their
AI robots (that NOBODY in the 3rd Imperium ever used). The robots bug me
because TL12 seems to be only good expert systems these days, but T4 has
IIRC the same paragraph as the old CT/MT stuff that says the Solomani Navy
was using AI robots for staff work during the fall of the 1st Imperium.

As for democracy in SF, I\'ve always liked Piper, Pournelle and Anderson\'s
writing (among lots of others) and their works don\'t imply that. I\'d say
that in some ways a good Democracy is damned inefficient (beware an
efficient government, they can pass laws so fast you\'ll be spinning).
