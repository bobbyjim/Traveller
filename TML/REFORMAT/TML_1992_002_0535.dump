after going through the books that I have I have some other
questions that perhaps you can answer. . .


Has anyone compiled a list of tasks that they have used in their
campaigns?  What I am thinking is that I am going to want to keep a
record of tasks, so I can stay consistent from day to day, and if
someone has already done this I can use some of the tasks on their
lists, without making up one on the fly and worrying about whether
it is accurate or not.

What is Allegiance Na (Not Available?), Uh, and Go, found in the
Dark Nebula Sector (Solomani & Aslan)?

Where is Zalucha (Massilia Sector, Knightfall adventure)?  It\'s hex
code is listed as being 2508, but so is Janeen, and Janeen appears
on the map in this hex, while Zalucha isn\'t even shown.

What is the population multiplier?  It is not explained in the
Ref\'s handbook.  Also, how do you figure out population density.

What is the signifigance of Stellar Size?  It says like Size II,
II, VI, D, etc in the Ref\'s book but I couldn\'t find an explanation
for it.  I know it is used for system creation but I want to know
what they mean in terms of diameter.

Under Step 6 of Extended System Generation it says to "Use the
previous throw for primary star type/size as +DM."  Does this mean
that if I rolled a type K star for my primary star (8 on a 2-12
scale) that the roll for the companion star would be +8?!  This is
precisely what it says to do but I don\'t see the reasoning behind
that one.  It effectively means that I can\'t roll anything higher
than a four if I want to stay on the chart.

I didn\'t like how a character\'s home planet law level dictated what
weapon skills that character could choose during creation.  So I
made the following changes.  Marines, no matter what law level
their home planet is, can choose any weapon skills.  This is
because they are a combat force and spend most of their time in
space anyway.  Same with Army. Even if they are stuck on their home
planet, government tech level inhibitions probably wouldn\'t apply
to them.  I could understand a planetary militia having SOME
restrictions, but an Imperial Marine shouldn\'t be disallowed to get
Energy Weapons simply because his homeworld doesn\'t allow them there.
Anyone see reasons why I shouldn\'t implement this in my campaign?

Ok, thanks again.  hasta.

    'body' => 'Evolution of the Zhodani Medium Warbot
(Megatrav versions of the common Zho warbot)

The Tliazhashal Corporation began manufacturing the PPO series
medium warbot when the corporation was founded in -4022 (Imperial).
The warbots accompanied the first Zhodani Core Expedition and have
been front line Consular equipment since then.  This makes it the
longest running model robot still currently in production.  The
design has been updated many times including a tech level fifteen
model (PPO5) which came off the drawing board in 1103.  The PPO5 is
produced on Zhdant and has yet to see full scale production
elsewhere in the Consulate.

The deployed front line units of the Consulate use the PPO4 model,
though some of the older models still see service in reserve units.

There have been some PPO series robots produced illegally outside
the Consulate.  However production of these units has ceased as
mysteriously as it began and the source of the robots was never
identified.

Armament is typically a laser rifle, though heavier armament such
as plasma (PGMP-13) or fusion (FGMP-14) guns may be substituted.
A RAM auto grenade launcher is also a common substitute in which
case the robot carries a load of 100 rounds.  Armament is carried
in a swiveling belt around the mid-section of the robot.  This
makes the robot a more stable gun platform when it mounts plasma or
fusion weapons, however it requires that the robot expose more of
itself in order to fire.

The robot has racks installed on its back for quick mission
specialization.  Typically these may mount sensors for advanced
reconaissance.  Laser communicators are also often used, as well as
electronic warfare pods.  Defensively they may mount smoke, flare
or chaff dispensers, prismatic-anti-laser-aerosols, or even small
sand casters.  The fuel cell power supply produces an extra 7Kw for
use by these mounted devices (only 6Kw available if a fusion gun is
mounted).

Less commonly, Tac missile launchers may be fitted to the robot\'s
racks which then home on target with the robot using its laser
rifle as a target designator.

The PPO series is also programmed and set to respond to psionic
flicking.  This allows a zhodani noble to take control of the robot
by use of psionics.

Na is Non-Aligned. The others are Aslan Clans I believe, but I don\'t
have references handy.

Population multiplier is the first digit in the population. Thus if
you have a population code of 6 1,000,000 - 9,999,999 people (quite
a range) then a multiplier of 4 indicates that there is 4x10^6 or
4,000,000-4,999,999 people (a much narrower range).

Density is people per unit area, thus knowing the surface area of a
sphere = 4*pi*r^2 If people do not live in the water then the
hydrographics percentage must be taken away from the surface area.
Then those people living in orbit (if significant) should be taken away
from the population total. Dividing the latter by the former will
give you population density.
This is of course of no real use. If you look at earth there are
large sections where the density is far below the mean (the poles,
deserts, etc.) while there are areas where the density is far greater
(Hong Kong, Japan, etc.)

Other than the fact that the sun is a Size V, not having my

This rule reflects the fact that smaller stars will have even
smaller companions (otherwise the first star would be referred
to as the companion). Most stars will have a dwarf star as a companion
and these tend to be Red (cool) stars. Presumably if you roll >12
then you should be reading the 12 result on the table.

As long as you don\'t allow the characters to muster out with fusion
weapons, then it won\'t matter if they are skilled with them or not.
Weapons of semi-mass destruction can cause many problems in a game,
not to mention scaring the natives.
However I do disagree with your points. First of all with law level.
Consider the use of military forces. If they are planet bound, and
the world is not balkanized, then the military won\'t need to have
weapons that many law levels above the populace. If they are
imperial, then the homeworld will have no effect, as the troops
will not be stationed on a single world. You should check exactly
what branch the characters have enlisted in. I don\'t get down to the
U.S. much, but I am quite certain that the U.S. Marines don\'t spend
too much of their time in space...
As for tech levels. This is where I most stongly disagree. Any Imperial
force can get whatever tech level you choose (usually 14-15). A subsector
force up to whatever the highest tech level in the subsector. However a
planetary force will not have any significant number of weapons (more than
one elite unit\'s worth) of a higher tech level for two reasons. 1) The
military is often ultra conservative. It is common for weapons to
be available for several years before the army will equip the main troops
with new weapons. (e.g. During the U.S. Civil war. Repeating rifles
were available, but the troops were issued with muskets) 2) The military
is very concerned with supplies and availablity of repair parts. Just
imagine if the tech 10 planetary force is equipped with tech 14 fusion
weapons. An invading force can simply blockade the planet, and skirmish
for a while. Soon the defending forces will have no functioning weapons,
and if they are not trained with non-energy weapons will be simple to
roll over with invading troops.

     Miakr called down from the bridge.  "We\'ve got targets!"
Jietlshaiepr hit the intercom, "Where are they?"
     "About seven hundred kilometers south east.  Heading
directly west.  They ought to pass within three hundred
kilometers of us.  Looks like three of the grav artillery
platforms and a G-carrier."
     Shtam turned to Corporal Delt, "You said you saw two
G-carriers.  We just accounted for two of them."
     "They might hove recovered it." sighed Smith.
     "It sounds as though they\'re headed back te their island."
announced Lt. Dragoon.
     "After doing what?" mused Kfoks, "I wonder..."
     "Jietlshaiepr," began Lt. Jones, "I hove a recon robot loose
upstairs, observing the mercs.  If we could get an antenna above
the surface we could find out exactly whot they been up to."
          - XLIV -
     "...cord.  Understand?  DAMMIT!  Are you recording this!?"
     The mechanical voice of the recon robot replied,
"Affirmative."
     Crulley\'s voice came back, tense and worried, "Oh...  Dr.
Jones?...  Able Spacehand Crulley \'ere... Uh...  We got big
trouble...  The mercs killed a dozen hostages... massacred an
entire town... They threaten more unless we surrender...
     They showed up in the capital wi\' their tanks... dropped off
some \'ostages..." Crulley swallowed, "They gunned \'em down.  They
came over on loudspeakers that unless we surrender they\'ll start
destroyin\' the towns one by one.
     "The people are ta hand us over ta \'em or be destroyed...
They demanded us by name...  If the natives don\'t hand us over ta
them, they\'ll destroy the towns...
     "A mob came after me...  I escaped, but that goddam robot of

     "The recon robot should be able ta keep track o\' where the

it understands my orders.
     "All right, that\'s enough, cut it...  Do you hear?... Cut
it!...  Understand?...  STOP RECORDI!..."
          - VL -
     The plan was quickly formed.  Negotiation was not even
seriously considered except as a delaying tactic.  Surrender was
out of the question; anyone who did would undoubtedly be killed.
     By themselves, the ironclad flotilla would be wiped out.
But, a commando strike supported by the natives in their grav
ironclads might just take the mercs down a notch or two.

     The interrogation of the pirate turned messy.  Lt. Jones
pulled him out of the low berth and stared into his mind.  A
search light went on over the consciousness of the man.  Facts
flowed from his mind like gelatin through the strainer of Jones
psionic probe.
     Zylath, a small planet in a large asteroid belt held their
operational base...  The Church of the Soverinity of Sol was
their recruiting office...  Their main base was on... ?  The man

survive, your full memory will be restored for you, but for now
absolute security must be maintained...

     Tuerz walked dejectedly into the crew lounge carrying the
black instrument case.  "I couldn\'t get any more out of him than
you did."
     "Our friends\'re quite paranoid." sighed Smith.  "Memory
wipe\'s rather dangerous stuff te play wi\'."
     Lt. Jones noticed a wet hairy rag in Tuerz hand as he played
with it.  It was an exceedingly familiar color.  "Is \'e still
alive."
     "Barely, though I don\'t think we\'ll get any more from him.
May as well kill him." Tuerz sighed and held up the lump of hair.
"Well, at least he wasn\'t bald."
     Jietlshaiepr blanched, "All right, Tuerz.  Get rid of him
quickly."
     "Flush \'im." agreed Lt. Jones.
     Tuerz nodded, "Well, Ok.  But I won\'t enjoy it."
          - IIL -
     A skeleton crew was left on the Flamboyant.  The rest piled
into the Gig and made for rendezvous with the Welles flotilla.
It was one of the strangest sights seen by man.  Four ironclads
steaming majestically through the air exuding black oily smoke
from their stacks.
     "We have a better grade of coal aboard:  low sulfur content,
but we are saving it for the attack.  For now we shall have to
tolerate the smoke." Captain Colorado of the Pasadena pointed
out.  Nepotism aside, he was a capable officer despite his noble
position:  heir to the first officership of the Prague.  The
actual hereditary first officer, his mother was admiral of the
fleet.  Yet Admiral Colorado was quite old so her son truly
commanded the fleet.
     "She\'s a fine ship." nodded Jietlshaiepr.  "What\'s her flank
speed?"
     "Forty three kilometers per hour airspeed.  The smaller
ships can make about fifty eight."
     "We\'d better come in on the windward side o\' their base."
advised Jones.
     "Agreed." nodded Captain Colorado.  "I\'ve been over our
charts and set course such that we should arrive on target at
dawn tomorrow.  We\'ll sweep in with the wind, and try to catch
them with their defenses down."
     "If I can get some of my team inside one of their tanks,"
thought Jietlshaiepr, "they\'ll have plenty to keep them
occupied."
     "How do you propose to do that?" asked Colorado
disbelievingly.
     "I am a noble of the Zhodani Consulate.  I can teleport with
ease.  The Droyne crew have a much better clairvoyant than I am.
They will give us a view of the target and we teleport inside."
     "Can you handle that machine?" Colorado asked.
     "Lt. Gresha has operated similar tanks, I will carry her
along with me.  We can run it, but we\'ll need help."
     Smith interjected, "That\'s where I come in.  Those aren\'t
really tanks so much as mobile artillery pieces:  \'eavy weapons
wi\' a powerful computer te back it up."
     "And te operate the guns there\'s the Droyne gunner from the
Kivas, Heet Kiv.  It\'s a teleport as well." added Jones. "I\'ll be
going in wi\' my security robot, Corporal Delt, Miakr and the
robot dog Vole.  We\'ll attack the transport ships wi\' demolition
packs.  Thot way, we can insure none\'ll escape before
reinforcements arrive from the League o\' Suns."
     Captain Colorado looked Jones in the eye, "I\'d be happy if
they just left.  As long as they\'re off my planet."
     "They\'d come back." Smith pointed out.
     "Possibly, but not till we\'d had a chance to prepare."
     "We must prevent \'em from striking another planet li\' this
one." urged Jones.
     "That won\'t bring back our dead, nor will it stop them from
burning our towns to ashes."
     "No." admitted Jietlshaiepr, "But, it might prevent the
horror from striking another world.  It may well stop another
holocaust."
          - IL -
     Dawn.
     Red sky in the morning,
     Sailor take warning.
     The ironclad flotilla cruised in low skimming the waves as
they raced out of the sun to the island in tight formation.  Sand
spread over bright red painted decks to keep them from getting
slippery with blood.  Sunrise glinting off gunmetal six pounders.
Grape shot and round shot standing by.  Artillery rockets set up
in the crow\'s nest.  Gatling guns polished to an oily shine.  Rum
ration quickly drunk.  Welles Navy battle ensign flapping in the
wind.  Signal flags:  "Welles expects everyone to their duty."
          - L -
     The flotilla scattered as it soared over the beaches.  Only
an unnamed mountain stood between the ironclads and their target
as the strike force jumped in grav belts.  Jietlshaiepr relaxed
to save her strength; she\'d every ounce soon enough.
     The Droyne felt out with the combined strength of their
minds.  Yes, the tanks lay unmanned; unmanned and unpowered.  The
image burned in Jietlshaiepr.  And in Smith.  And in the Droyne
Warrior, Heet Kiv.
     They were there.  Jietlshaiepr puffed with the exertion and
distance as she and Gresha came into existence inside the grav
tank.
     "Vargr!  What a ride!" breathed Gresha.  Immediately, she
scanned the controls of the mobile artillery piece.  Heavy
weapons, heavy power needs, heavy weight.  "Find me a checklist.
Fast!"  She began to guess her way through the starting
procedure.  Can\'t give the thing a walk around, but they must
keep it ready for action...  Fusion plant starting sequence...
Starting batteries...  Fuel flow...  Magnetic bottle...
Grrracht!  Where\'s the vacuum pumps?!
     "GaaaerrrrrrrRRRRR!"  Capacitors discharged, pumps surged
deuterium flowed, a spark began to glow in the belly of the
monster.
     "There, now we\'ve power to close the damn door!" she panted.
"Now, all we can do is wait for full power."
     The view screens looked outside.  Bored sentries stood
outside.  None looked more than half awake in the fingers of
dawn.
     Slowly, a group walked out of a large barracks.  Four
comrades walked side by side towards the lead grav tank.  A man
and a woman flanked by two men.  The man in the center:  1.85
meters tall, fair skin, short cropped blonde hair.
     Smith zoomed the screen in on his face.
     "Major Ollie Sutherland..."
     The crew walked over to their grav tank and embarked.
     A second crew began walking to the other grav tank.
     The hull of the lead tank shut itself.
     From the same barracks, two men walked out and turned to
face the barracks door waiting.
     "How\'s our power?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     "Thirty six megawatts and rising...  We\'ll need about fifty
two to get aloft...  Thirty seven megawatts...  about forty
seconds, four minutes after that we\'ll have full power."
     One more figure came out of the barracks an joined the other
two.  The three men stood together, talking and yawning in the
early light.  A fourth came shaking a sleepy head.  They walked
toward the last grav tank:  theirs.
     Smith glared into the tank commander\'s mind:  "I\'ve
forgotten something..."
     He hesitated and started back.  He got halfway back before
he turned around again.  He ran to catch up when the one leading
the group fell flat on his face.  Smith stifled a laugh as he
found his shoe laces tied together.  A bored sentry laughed and
walked over to help him.
     Smith sat silent.
     Slowly, unnoticed, but sure and deadly, the pin worked out
of one of the sentries grenades.
     The sentry and two of the tank crew shattered in a red
cloud.  The explosion echoed over the base.
     "Wake them, ought to." chirped Heet.
     One echo suddenly came louder than the others, the burst of
a six pound load of grape shot as the first of the ironclads came
in range.  They came flying over the northern foot hills of the
nameless mountain.  They\'d broken formation and were attacking at
will.  The Weehawken came first, flying low followed by the
Bismark on the Weehawken\'s port side.  To starboard drove the
Laramie while the Pasadena fell behind with her inferior speed.
     Suddenly, the lead grav tank lifted off and moved away from
the camp.
     "We\'ve got flying power!" called Gresha.
     "Keep it on the ground." snapped Smith.  "We\'ll play dead
until we\'ve got full power."
     Ollie Sutherland\'s grav tank began belching six centimeter
shells from it\'s twin auto cannon.  The G-carrier lifted off and
opened up with a five megawatt laser.  Suddenly, the Pasadena was
on fire.  The port bow gouted flame as iron plate melted and wood
ignited.
     The guns were not silenced as the Pasadena took on a list to
starboard.  The starboard six pounder spoke in defiance and the
gatling guns sniped at the mercenaries as they ran for cover.
     A six pound shell burst on the G-carrier\'s side sending it
spinning.  The armor plate cracked under the force of the blast
opening the hull like a walnut.  Inside, the two crew looked out
the gaping hole in surprise before they regained control of the
spinning troop carrier.
     An Air/Raft came whizzing in to intercept the Weehawken,
death spat from a VRF gauss gun as the raft strafed the ironclad.
     Suddenly, the air thudded loudly with the sound of a
charging heavy plasma gun.  A shriek as it fired, blazing out in
a deadly bolt which struck the Pasadena in the casemate.
     The Pasadena shattered in a blinding flash as plasma found
the magazine.
          - LI -
     Niedrsha gripped the PGMP-14 tightly, and swooped up from
tree top flight to intercept the G-carrier as it came out of its
spin.  Drert pulled up sharply to follow carrying a FGMP-14.
     The G-carrier was just turning to bear on the Laramie when
the plasma gun blazed.  A bolt of ionized plasma seared through
the aft end of the G-carrier throwing molten armor plate into the
air.  An explosion rang from inside and flame blazed out of the
hole the six pounder had gouged.  A moment later it began to fall
like a brick.  It plowed a deep path through a glen before
burying itself and exploding.
     Suddenly, Niedrsha\'s battle dress sensors went wild.
     The near miss indicator screamed about flying metal.  He
jerked his head to look as VRF gauss needles ripped his chest
open.
          - LII -
     Shtam and Kfoks peeled off after the Air/Raft closely
followed by Tuerz.  Shtam\'s gauss rifle cracked 4mm death at the
crew.  The gunner at the VRF gauss gun suddenly went into an
epileptic seizure as his body shook under the repeated impacts of
supersonic gauss needles.
     The driver slumped when half his head exploded under the
storm of X-rays from Tuerz laser pistol.
     The radio channel to Niedrsha and Drert was dead.
          - LIII -
     Lt. Jones, Miakr, Vole, Corporal Delt, and the security
robot flew in towards the transports just above the trees.  They
on a different attack course from the others so they would not
attract too much unwanted attention.
     Jones watched over his shoulder as Major Ollie\'s tank lined
up on the now blazing Weehawken.  The air shuddered as the heavy
gun prepared to fire.  A thousand devils screamed as it poured
its hell plasma onto the ironclad.  A cloud blazed as the ship
disintegrated.
     "Corporal Delt!" shouted Jones, "Halt!  Stand guard over me.
The rest of you, get the charges planted!"
     Jones went to the ground and stared at the menacing tank as
it lined up to fire on the Bismark.  He wrapped his mind around
one of his demolition charges.  Under his determined guidance, it
lifted into the air and flew towards the tank.  His grip weakened
as it lengthened.  He struggled to keep it aloft.
     The air began to shudder again announcing the devil fire
when the magnetic charge attached itself with a loud click.
Inside, did they wonder what had hit them?
     Jones flicked the detonator.
     The grav tank was enveloped in smoke and flame.  Can the
charge punch a hole in that armor?
     As the smoke cleared, the tank began to wobble.  The whine
of tortured machinery sounded across the island just audible
under the cannon fire.
     The crew cockpit was smashed open like a ripped can.  Armor
plates buckled around a gaping hole.  The tank listed to
starboard and plowed through the island growths before it ground
itself to a stop.
     Jones and Delt lit off to investigate.
          - LIV -
     Niedrsha stood in amazement.
     The armored body lying before him made no sense.
     Lying on the ground was half a figure in Zhodani battle
dress.  In it\'s arms was a PGMP-14 apparently undamaged.  On the
left shoulder was written \'Niedrsha\'.
     He glanced at himself in confusion.  What am I doing lying
over there dead?  Suddenly, something clawed at him.  The weapon
in his hand...
     was a fusion gun...?
     I was carrying a plasma gun and Drert had a fusion gun...
This one!
     He looked at his left shoulder patch:  \'Drert\'.
     With rising dread he pushed the emergency release on the
dead body\'s helmet.  It split into the two clamshell halves
revealing Drert\'s face.
          - LV -
     "We\'ve got full power!" shouted Gresha.
     "Take off!" shouted Smith, as Jietlshaiepr sat in grief and
confusion.  "Get us out of the blast region!  We\'re gonna smear
that tank over the horizon."
     The last grav tank lay rounded, still unable to get power
up.  A six pound shell smacked into the side of the tank and
bounced harmlessly off the heavy armor plateing.
     "Those grreeches idiots are shooting at us!" growled Gresha.
She glanced at Jietlshaiepr as she sat frozen at the controls.
     Not quite frozen.  The air began booming as the heavy gun
stewed it\'s plasma blast.
     Jietlshaiepr triggered the gun and sent the helpless grav
tank to oblivion.
          - LVI -
     Lt. Dragoon, Able Spacehand Turner, and Private Walker
soared in towards the mercenary command center.  Dragoon\'s laser
rifle spewed visible wavelength photons wildly as she bore in on
the target singlemindedly.  Figures in combat armor saw the three
Valkyries blazing death at them and returned fire with light
assault guns.
     Flechettes cascaded off the trio\'s armor.  They weren\'t
expecting armored targets...
     Walker\'s PGMP-12 blazed once rending limbs from two
different defenders.
     "Look out!" screamed Turner, "Warbots:  four o\'clock!"
     Three medium Zhodani warbots, PPO series, came in at them
blazing light from laser rifles.
     Walker glowed red for a moment and slumped.  Her grav belt
continued to carry her over the base.
     Turner dove for cover among the base buildings with a warbot
on her tail.  Dragoon blazed laser light of her own at the
warbots.
          - LVII -
     Miakr was just approaching the transports when the warbot
cry went up.  "It\'s a blasted good thing I..." he muttered and
flipped on the high powered transmitter he\'d mounted on his belt.
He could only guess as to the frequencies used by the robots, and
Zhodani warbot security was tough.  Still there was a chance...
          - LVIII -
     Lt. Jones and Corporal Delt leapfrogged over to the crash
site.  The tank lay on its belly, leaning on its starboard side.
The main gun hung dead on its goose neck with the shredded
command pennant hanging by a thread.  The cockpit had been
cracked and torn open by the blast.  Delt covered Jones as he
leaped inside with his SMG at the ready.
     Jones refolded the SMG into a small featureless box and
attached it to his belt:  no threats here.  Four bodies lay in
the couches.  One of the three gunners were more or less intact.
One\'s head and right shoulder were missing.  The driver at first
looked merely surprised.  She sat slumped at the controls wide
eyed and blank faced, but a steel rod had run straight through
her head.
     Ollie Sutherland was slumped at the controls for the main
gun.  There was blood on his uniform and couch, but very little
on him.
     He was deeply unconscious.  Jones quickly went over him and
found... nothing?  Jones took a step back and came to the
realization that his patient, while spattered in his own
(obviously fresh) blood, was perfectly healthy.
     Jones slipped a tranquilizer into his blood stream.  Well,
if he\'s Ok, let\'s keep him.
     He told Corporal Delt to stand guard over the prisoner and
flew off to the fray.
          - LIX -
     The warbots froze and hovered.  Only one was left near
Dragoon, the others had been harrying the ironclads.
     Dragoon looked at Walker and Turner through the pain of the
laser burns on her waist and left thigh.  Walker was still alive
at least.  Turner\'s combat armor was far too grotesquely melted
for that diagnosis.
     She turned on the command center.  A figure in combat armor
crouched behind the doorway with a light assault gun.  There was
a sudden flash in the door as Dragoon\'s laser illuminated it.
     A round of high explosive blazed from a window and exploded
meters from her.
     She paused to consider how best to send the defenders to
hell, when an Air/Raft swooped in with Tuerz at the controls.
Shtam sent burst after burst of VRF gauss needles into the
building while Kfoks and a confused looking figure in Drert\'s
battle dress held their fire:  fusion guns would demolish the
entire command building.
     Suddenly, the figure in the door held his hand to his ear,
stood at attention, saluted, and fell woodenly.
     "\'at\'s it!" came Jones\'s voice, "Their checking out!"
     Dragoon charged in.
          - LX -
     Dragoon managed to kill one of the defenders before the
poison had completely finished him off.  She kicked the door to
the commander\'s office open.  Nobody home?
     The camera system on her combat armor picked up the bomb.
     Lt. Jones only got a glimpse of it through the relay before
Dragoon dived through a window and flew off shouting.
     "Everybody get clear!" he called with authority over the
radio as he came barrelling in.  He guessed it was only a kiloton
but that was enough.
     Jietlshaiepr\'s commanding voice came over the circuit.
"Stuzzel, get that Gig in here.  Miakr, drop the charges and get
on the Gig.  Tuerz, take Turner on board the Air/Raft and get on
the Gig.  We\'ll take Walker in the tank.  Delt, carry the
prisoner to the Gig.  Kfoks, warn the Laramie.  Niedrsha?"
     "Yeah, I\'m here, I guess..." came a bewildered voice.
     Her voice softened, "You warn the Bismark.  Just tell them
to get clear of the island as fast as they can.  Ok?"
     "I... got it." he answered.
     Jones swooped into the control building.
     The rest swooped off to obey orders.

First, if I were concerned about the passive sensors of potential

They must be very easy to detect, especially by passive IR.

Second, if I were a concerned world government, I might not allow

So, what would be wrong with having two maneuver drive systems in your
spacecraft?  One fusion rocket drive for in-system performance, and
one grav drive (not thrusters) for planetary use.  OK, so this adds
some extra hardware.  But the grav drive just needs to be big enough
to produce the highest G to get you off a world, no more than 2G.  The
two drives could both be used in-system, with a 50% reduction in
efficiency in the grav unit beyond 10 diameters.  And when you don\'t
want your exhaust lighting up the passive sensors for half a parsec,
cruise on the grav unit (at 50% efficiency).

Of course, if my thinking is skewed, I\'m sure you will all let me know.

Not necessarily. Fusion rockets don\'t use all that much fuel, so there\'s
not that much exhaust. And space is big. There\'s a lot of IR sources out
there too.

Once again, you have to consider the *scale* involved. A fusion rocket
giving 6 gs of acceleration to a *thousand* ton (mass, not
displacement!) would be "burning" 10 *kilograms* of fuel per second.
(assuming the more reasonable Isp of 600,000 instead of the atrociously
higher one in the rules)(note that a higher Isp *reduces* the fuel used)

I think that even at fusion temperatures we can deal with that small an
exhaust. It may burnm *small* holes in the field, but more likely,
they\'ll have "blast pits" to handle that.

And since the exhaust is hydrogen & helium, it\'s not exactly a hazard.
It *will* create some nitrogen oxides as it reacts with an oxy-nitrogen
atmosphere.

The only real hazard is the brightness.

Well, you won\'t light up the sensors for *that* far. And even if you
did, you\'d have 1.6 *years* before they noticed.

Heck, at a "mere" million km away, you\'ve got over 3 seconds lag *each
way*. At 1 AU (approx 150 million kn), it\'d take 500 seconds for the
heat/light/etc from your drive to get to their sensors. And even longer
for any sort of response to get back...

	"Well, 8 minutes ago, he was *there* and made a course
	adjustment. Now he\'s running stealthed again. He could be
	anywhere in this area, according to the tacitcal computer... "

	(computer displays plot showing possible locations of ship
	given position of burn and best estimates of original velocity
	and the delta-V from the burn)

Game it out with the vector movement system or the Mayday rules. If you
can\'t be sure how fast he was moving, nor the magnitude *or direction*
of his velocity change, you can only maker an educated guess. And the
area keeps growing...

Oh yeah, at 1 g that thousand tonner can travel 1 AU in a bit over 48
hours. Doing so, it\'ll use 288+ tons of fuel. And be travelling at 1732
km/s (about .5% of light speed!)

Don\'t ask me how he\'s gonna slow down!

A million ton battleship (moderately light by MT standards) pulling 3g\'s
requires 5000Kg/s of fuel, which produces an energy of 9E16 joules.  At
a range of 2000-odd Km, that appears about as bright as the Sun viewed
from Earth-orbit.  At 1AU, it is about 16 times as bright as AlphaCent
viewed from Earth-orbit.  At combat ranges (500,000Km or less), it is
over 1000,000 times as bright as AlphaCent as viewed from Earth (that\'s
brighter than the moon!).  This will NOT fade into the background!

10Kg/s at Isp 600,000 produces energy equivalent to a 50 KT bomb every
second.   This will NOT produce "*small* holes".  Unless you define
*small* as comparable to Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  Keep in mind that it
takes you 6g rocket 6 seconds to reach 1Km+ altitude.  So you\'ll dump
the equivalent of a 300 KT bomb on the launch site.  This will not be
dealt with be "blast pits".

discussed seems to be based on a mass-reaction idea (ie chucking stuff out
the back *very* fast).

Fusion power plants in Traveller are considered to be contained fusion
reactors which then power the maneuver drives.  It could be argued therefore
that traveller drives work by an "impulse" mechanism, that is creating a
force (and hence accelaration) action without any accompanying reaction.

This requires you to break the usual Newtonian mechanics but then every law
in physics has its exceptions.

Ships driven by impulse engines would be as "quiet" as their shielding would
allow.  (They would also be as "green" as you could be :-)

Hi, I\'m new to TML and noticed mention of "the New Era" in a recent
posting.  This has probably been talked to death already so if someon
could point me at the relevant postings then I can get them out of
archive.

I\'m only just getting into Mega-Traveller after a long absence from the
original Traveller so I\'m not even up on what\'s been happening in the
Imperium at the moment.

I\'ve just seen a copy of GDW\'s MYTHUS by Gary Gygax and was wondering if
"the New Era" was going to come out under this new system (I hope not)?

Also, I\'ve got a friend (yes I do have one!) who has been trying to join
TML via the traveller-request path and hasn\'t received any response.  I
also tried posting it there for him and its all very quiet.  Is there a
problem?  I\'ve been using the new address and nothings bounced back yet.

Now *subtract* the portion of that that is kinetic energy of the ship
and of the exhaust. Only the remaining energy will be available for
radiating.

10Kg/s at Isp 600,000 produces energy equivalent to a 50 KT bomb every
second.   This will NOT produce "*small* holes".  Unless you define
*small* as comparable to Hiroshima or Nagasaki.  Keep in mind that it
takes you 6g rocket 6 seconds to reach 1Km+ altitude.  So you\'ll dump
the equivalent of a 300 KT bomb on the launch site.  This will not be
dealt with be "blast pits".

Once again, you are assuming that the energy is "just there". Look upon
it as a plamsa arc torch with a 10 Kg/s flow rate. It\'ll vaporize the
hell out of anything that gets in the way, but it is *directed* energy
(at least at first).

Compare this with a Saturn 5. The first stage of the Saturn V was good
for quite a few kilotons if it blew. But in a normal launch, the the
exhaust damage wasn\'t that hard to contain. A fusion rocket with the
same thrust (6 million pounds) would use 10 *pounds* of fuel per
second. The energy release is of the same order of magnituide., it\'s
just more concentrated. (yes, I picked that thousand ton ship in the
original message *specifcly* because it was "equivalent" to a Saturn 5!)

Stop and think, a 10 kg/sec jet is going to be fairly small. *Easily*
less that 10 meters. More like *one* meter. Especially considering the
exhaust velocity (roughly 2% off lightspeed!). (anybody know enough
plasma physics to rough out an answer? If not, I\'ll just treat it as
hydrogen gas, and work it out that way...)

It may bore a hole 100 meters deep in the rock of a class X starport,
but the hole will be fairly narrow.

Look on it as a directed energy hydrogen bomb.  It will only be directed
until it hits something (like the ground), then it will begin dispersing.
Which dispersal will have an effect not unlike a nuclear explosion.

No.  For a rocket of a given thrust, energy release is proportional to Isp.
A Saturn V (with an Isp of 270 more or less) has a power rating of
4.4E10 Watts (about.  7,500,000 Lbs thrust,  BTW, not 6).  A fusion rocket
with Isp 600,000 has a power rating of 9.8E13 Watts.  I personally do not
consider a factor of 2000 to be "the same order of magnitude".

Have you ever seen a shaped charge warhead go off?  I have.  It
(theoretically) makes a very small needle jet of plasma.  But after
it hits something hard, it looks just like an HE shell exploding.  If
a fusion jet burns a hole in the ground, the jet will transfer it\'s
entire kinetic energy to the launch site before it\'s through.  Which will
look like a small hydrogen bomb.  And what happens after you get more
than 100m in the air?  You give the jet time to diffuse before it hits
something solid, and make the effects on the countryside worse.  Keep in
mind that we are still talking 50KT/s here.  Dumped into the atmosphere
for at least 25 seconds (you actually won\'t be above 20Km in only 25s).
So you dump energy equivalent to a megaton bomb into the starport.  Frankly,
if the starport can take that kind of abuse routinely, then nuclear attack
should be no big deal to the worlds of the Imperium.

     Surgeon Lt. Jones sweated over the operation.  The patient was
a very delicate one and exploratory surgery was dangerous for
patient and surgeon alike.  Three digit numbers clicked by as he
worked.  One zero four...  I\'d never make it if I left now...
     Contrary to popular fiction, when facing danger, one\'s life
does not pass before ones eyes, one just keeps working up until the
bomb explodes or the vehicle crashes or death in whatever of its
myriad forms hands you your bill and will only take cash.
     Zero six three...  Jones was oblivious to all save the
detonator and its attendant systems.  He didn\'t even notice
Jietlshaiepr\'s hands on his shoulders as she prepared herself to
teleport them both out.
     Zero two six...  Jietlshaiepr monitored her troop as they
submerged at extreme range, at least Niedrsha would be safe...  If
it was Niedrsha...?
     Zero one four...  She began to muster the last of her psionic
strength...
     Zero zero nine...  Could she teleport them both far enough?
     Zero zero eight...  She had too...
     Zero zero seven...  Pop!  Jones shivered.
     Zero zero seven...  Jones collapsed in mirth.
     Applause sounded behind them.  Jietlshaiepr dove over the
office desk and whirled around with her gauss pistol aimed at the
unknown audience.
     A blank videoscreen was activated on the other side of the
office.  Its camera was facing them as the screen\'s speaker sounded
the applause.
     "Very good!  Very good!" called a saccharine voice.  Jones
recognized the leader\'s voice from the mind probe of the pirate.
He exchanged glances with Jietlshaiepr.
     "Glad ya enjoyed it Colonel McNamara." he responded
cheerily.
     "Oh, I did very much Lieutenant... Jones isn\'t it?" responded
the disembodied sweet malevolence, "What do you do for an encore?"
     "We win." stated Jietlshaiepr simply.
     "Now this IS unusual isn\'t it?" came the voice with an audible
smirk.  "Zhodani teleport commandoes working with the League of
Suns Naval Intelligence?  Not something you see every day..."
     "No, just every other Thursday." smiled Jones as he began
ransacking the desks and gathering up papers and computer disks.
     "Or when we find a common enemy." added Jietlshaiepr.
     "Me?  Common?" laughed McNamara, "Anyway I suggest you consult
the nearest Consular embassy to find out who the enemy is."
     "You DESTROYED the Consulate embassy on this planet." she
reminded him icily.
     Jones turned and walked out carrying the documents he\'d
gathered.
     "Listen." whispered the speaker, "You\'ve just destroyed a
Consular backed secret project.  The League spy just walked out of
that office with enough evidence to link the Consulate to this
operation.  You must kill the spies before they find out and
destroy that evidence, else we are all doomed."
     "Prove it."
     "I can\'t.  But their sure to try to sabotage your ship.  Kill
them before they kill you.  We\'ll take their bodies and allow your
ship to escape.  Now, move!  An SDB is on the way to raze that base
in twenty four minutes.  And what ever you do, don\'t let the
transport ships be damaged!"
          - LXII -
     Miakr started picking up scrambled communications as they
approached in the Gig.  He and Shtam began struggling with the
computer coding systems.
     At last McNamara\'s voice came out "...out three thousand
credits?  Would that disturb your memory sufficiently?"
     Lt. Jones voice answered, "If yer goin\' to insult our
loyalties, ya might at least make it an interestin\' insult."
     "Four thousand...  How much do Lieutenants and Ensigns make in
the Navy eh?"
     "More \'an that." answered Smith.
     "All right, seven thousand."
     "Yer not even in the right order o\' magnitude." declared Jones
boredly.
     "All right.  Name it then.  Name your own price."
     One could hear Jones smile, "Oh, at least...  twenty
thousand."
     "Done.  But for that much I..."
     "That\'s twenty thousand fer each of us." amended Smith.
     ...Pause...
     "Very well.  But for that much, I want no one to have heard of
this, including your Zhodani friends."
     "Who said they were our friends?" asked Smith.
     "In addition to your report being... incomplete, I want all
the documents you took returned, any prisoners released, the two
transport ships untouched, AND you must destroy the Zhodani ship."
     "Dragoon would enjoy that." commented Smith.
     "I think that might cost ya something extra." cautioned Jones.
     "Oh? and may I remind you of the captives my men have taken?
What is the count?...  Oh yes... Two thousand six hundred and fifty
one captives, young women between the ages of eleven and twenty
four.  Surely, you don\'t want them burned down with the island do
you?"
     "\'old on a moment." said Jones.
     A radio detonator sat waiting boredly.  Suddenly, it heard its
call to destiny.
     The fuel tanks of the two transport ships wired up by Miakr
and Vole ruptured spilling compressed liquid hydrogen over the
cargo decks and vaporized instantly.  Pressure swelled momentarily
inside the ships then a second charge ignited the inflammable mix
of hydrogen and oxygen.  Both ships became bombs which leaped
skyward scattering the hulls to the winds.
     "NOW it\'s a deal." confirmed Jones.
     "Not really, you\'ve just lost your biggest bargaining chip,
and my patience."
          - LXIII -
     They quickly got the transmitter\'s range and bearing.  It lay
on the surface of the water twenty nine kilometers away and
running.  Radar could just barely make out the exposed dorsal
section of a scout ship.
     They took off in the Gig in pursuit, but the ship submerged.
They flew over the prisoners quarters where the mercenaries
captives sat.  They would have to wait evacuation, the Gig was
overcrowded before, now it was doubly so with the unconscious Major
Ollie Sutherland, and the four warbots Miakr had taken control of.
Neither of the two surviving ironclads could carry passengers.
Surely, not even the pirates would...
          - LXIV -
     They monitored the bombardment of the island from the
Flamboyant.  It lasted four hours.  Nothing could have survived.
The SDB was joined in it\'s mission by the Fanzheinz class trader.
The island was leveled.
     Two thousand, six hundred and fifty one...
          - LXV -
     The League of Suns party was meekly disarmed and under guard.
Smith worked on setting Sutherland up for interrogation.  Jones and
Jietlshaiepr got to work treating the wounded.
     Lt. Dragoon was only lightly wounded.  A laser had seared away
the armor on her abdomen leaving third degree burns.  There was a
similar burn on her left thigh.
     Pvt. Walker was more seriously hurt.  A section of her left
arm had been literally burned away.  A first rate hospital would
probably have removed the remains of arm and started regeneration
techniques.  The Flamboyant had good facilities but nothing that
could start a treatments like that.
     "We\'ll just have to try the old fashioned way." mumbled
Jietlshaiepr.
     Turner was dead, but her body could be used.  Jones didn\'t
bother giving it a second thought.  "Right, take what ya need if
the tissue type\'s compatible.  I may need some tissue myself fer
skin grafting."
     They got to work.  Dragoon insisted on a local anesthetic to
watch Jones.  She also insisted that the burn on her abdomen be
left ungrafted:  she liked the pattern.
     Slowly, Jietlshaiepr rebuilt Walker\'s arm.  The entire left
biceps was gone as was brachial artery and a good section of nerve,
but Turner\'s tissue type proved compatible.  Bone grafting proved
unnecessary as the humerus was intact.  When it was over,
Jietlshaiepr and Jones collapsed.
          - LXVI -
     Jietlshaiepr staggered through the door to her darkened
stateroom.  Niedrsha sat on the side of the bed staring at his
hands.  She watched him closely for a moment.  He was a full
eighteen centimeters taller than before...  His face was...
changing... It looked as though someone had grafted his head onto
Drert\'s body. She stepped quietly to him and took his hand.  His
hands were larger... the veins and tendons less distinct... maybe
a bit more hair on the back.  What about the rest of him?...  What
about his mind?
     Niedrsha was totally drained:  as though some one had switched
off all the emotions in his brain with the casual attitude of
flicking a light switch.  He stared down at his hands not wanting
to meet her eyes.
     Finally, it was he who broke the silence.  "I pulled Drert out
of the armor.  He\'s ready for burial..."
     "I\'m sorry." was all she could manage.
     "I got a good look at \'em when I pulled the armor off." He
looked up with scared eyes.  "It\'s *My* body that\'s... dead.  But
I\'m here...  This is his...  I\'m... him?"
     She sat next to him and pulled his head to her shoulder.  She
looked closely at him.  He was right.  All the subtle unique things
about his body had changed...  More heavily muscled...  Slightly
more hirsute...  but it was Niedrsha\'s head that leaned on her
shoulder.
     Slowly, through the fog, he realized she was shaking.
     He shifted and held her closely, she continued to shake.
Dimly, he realized his shoulder was growing wet.
     "What...?"
     "Everyone...  Dead.  Drert...  Turner...  Crulley...  The
Pasadena...  The Weehawken...  The Shoolist...  Two thousand
girls... Two *thousand*!..." Her voice dropped, "Never mind the
three million they killed with their virus..."
     She looked him in the eye with tears on her face.  "And...
I... nearly lost... *You*..."
     She drew a half sobbed breath, "Are you really Niedrsha?"
     She clung tightly to him as she sobbed herself to sleep.  What
seemed hours later, Niedrsha numbly realized he was on the verge of
unconsciousness from fatigue.  "Hmmm.  I\'m exhausted.  I suppose I
should sleep."  He fell asleep with Jiet\'s question rattling around
in his (or was it Drert\'s?) brain.
          - LXVII -
     Slowly, they brought Major Ollie Sutherland to consciousness.
Jones read his mind as he came back inside the sensory deprivation
chamber.
     Anger...  Aggression...  Hate...  Kill...  seeped from the
semiconscious mind as it rose toward full consciousness.  Suddenly,
all went blank.  Ollie had put up a psi shield.
     "Well, it explains \'is lack of wounds." sighed Jones, "\'e must
be able te regenerate \'imself psionically."
     "Ok." nodded Jietlshaiepr, "He\'s psionic.  Well, he\'s not a
teleport, or he\'d not be here.  The question is, does he know any
other psionic disciplines?"
          - LXVIII -
     An hour later, Vole reported that Ollie\'s shield was down.
Jones read his mind.  A picture came through, a picture of the
inside of the Gig where he was standing.
     "All right he\'s clairvoyant." nodded Smith.  "That\'ll ruin our
sensory deprivation work."
     Jones shook his head.  "Not necessarily.  Might take longer,
bu\' surely the deprivation\'ll wear \'im down regardless."
          - LXIX -
     A neural activity sensor was left pointed at Ollie.  The
moment he lowered his shield and showed on the detector, a telepath
was there to read his mind.  Jietlshaiepr, Smith and Jones worked
in four hour shifts.  Every three or four hours the neural activity
sensor went off.  A picture began to emerge:  the Gig...  the
ship...  the bridge... the engine room...  the hold...  the
turrets...  the Vipers in their bays...
     It was then that Lt. Jones suggested putting a guard on the
fighter bays.
          - LXX -
     It was near the end of Ens. Smith\'s watch when the sensor went
off again.  Stuzzel looked over at her boredly.  He was guarding
her.  The Flamboyant crew hadn\'t totally believed that Smith and
Jones had been trying to fool whoever had been on the other side of
the radio conversation.  She looked into a mind that was full of
anger and hate and was gripping someone by the throat.
     Suddenly, her consciousness was fading.  She reeled over into
the chair she\'d just stood up from.  Stuzzel dropped his ACR and
clutched his own throat.
     As she lost conciousness, she saw the low berth open of its
own accord and Major Ollie Sutherland step out.
          - LXXI -
     Miakr was bored.  He\'d been standing in the corridor outside
the lower fighter bay for five hours and was *bored*.  One of the
captured warbots could do the job very easily if he could readjust
the command recognition programming and the recognition program...
fairly easy stuff but it tends to take ones whole attentio...
     An iris valve opened.  Ah, company...
     ACR slugs caught him as he turned.  The gauss pistol spat in
reply but shock and pain spoiled his aim as he fell to the deck.
     Alarms began to blare.  A minute later, Lt. Jones was leaning
over him examining the wounds as Shtam went for the fighter bay
hatch.  Already one could hear the bay flooding with water as the
fighter was prepared for release.
     Shtam punched the intercom.  "He\'s escaping in Viper number
two.  Kfoks, launch in number one immediately.  We\'ve got to get
the Flamboyant powered up and ready for anything.  All hands:
battle stations."  He turned and ran to his engines.
          - LXXII -
     Kfoks ran his fingers over the Viper\'s console.  "Bridge, give
me emergency starting power!"  The power lines surged with the
power necessary for a powered kindle fire in the fighter\'s fusion
plant.  Quickly, the plant reached threshold and Kfoks hit the
starter.  "Lucky he took Stuzzel\'s Viper, Tuerz always keeps his
ship preflighted for emergencies.  Bless his minescule, paranoid,
psychopathic heart!"
     The cables dropped automatically as Kfoks called for release.
Water poured in over the Viper and the upper hatch opened.  Slowly,
the Viper rose from the bay into the black waters.  The tiny
fighter was blind.  None of her sensors worked underwater unless
you counted landing lights as sensors.
     "Well, I can\'t talk to the Flamboyant for directions, but he
wouldn\'t be sticking around down here anyway..."
     He pushed for full power and began to rise slowly as the power
plant rose to meet the demand.  By the time the plant was at
capacity, he could see the surface of the ocean overhead.  He burst
from the water like a flying fish and sparkled in the sun.  The
Viper opened her eyes.
     "Tally ho!" The sensors picked out the fleeing target.
Bearing:  nine six degrees.  Speed:  One point oh five kilometers
per second.  Range:  Fifty two kilometers.
     Quickly, Kfoks line up his target lock on radar.  Incoming
radar pulses on me!...  He flipped on the EMS jammer and threw the
Viper into a series of spiralling zig zags away from the
illuminating radar.  Quickly he was free from the searchlight and
returned his concentration to pursuit and attack.
     Radar lock...  now...  Ladar...  Missile away!...
     The missile blazed in on the fleeing target which dipped and
screamed off wildly dodging to the south and then nose down and
went for the deck.  The missile sped past close but missed.  The
enemy Viper rolled over and resumed its flight.
     The radio squawked, "Any ships in orbit, this is Major
Sutherland.  I\'ve escaped from the enemy vessel, requesting
assistance.  Over."
     "Roger, Major we\'re reading you.  What do you need?  Over."
     Kfoks kicked on the radio jammer and lined up on target.  A
second missile sped away on course to the fleeing Viper.  With the
radio jammer on he was screaming his location, but if that bastard
managed to call in fire from orbit...
     Sutherland dodged and pulled up sharply into the clouds.  The
missile sped after him.
     Kfoks watched the clouds as he flew towards them and waited.
No sign of impact.  On radar the targets converged.  Kfoks fired
his third missile as he blazed toward the targets.
     The second missile blazed by the twisting craft.  Then
Sutherland spun her around to bear on Kfoks.
     The laser sensor horn blared.  Damn, Ollie had a good lock on
him.  A piercing sound went through Kfoks ears:  Enemy missile
launch.
     He rolled the controls into a twisting turn that fought the
inertial compensators.  The Viper responded like a thing alive
while the missile homed in on him.
     Kfoks cut the jammers and put the Viper on its tail, climbing
straight up at a kilometer a second.  He threw it into a corkscrew
that sent the missile off.  It flew by fifty meters from the
twisting fighter.
     Kfoks flipped his charger back toward his adversary.  Radar
sweep negative.  Vrassssh!  Have I lost him?  He spun back on
Ollie\'s previous bearing:  niner six.
     He peeled back the Viper\'s eye lids and checked the sky.
Nothing...  Nothing...  Nothing...  Nothing...
     A smudge...?  A faint trace ran across the radar screen.  IR
made it out as about three thousand degrees...  Falling fast...
     Finally, the wreckage fell into the sea.
          - LXXIII -
     Kfoks met Tuerz on his way back.  Tuerz had taken the Gig off
in pursuit shortly after Kfoks but had been left behind by the
airfoil streamlining of the Vipers and the slow power build up of
the larger power plant.
     "Are you sure you got the bastard?  Over."
     "Negative, I didn\'t see it hit, but I picked up what looked
like falling wreckage.  Couldn\'t have survived if I hit him.
Over."
     "You\'d better have!  He\'s killed Stuzzel!  His throat\'s been
crushed!"
          - LXXIV -
     Sensor readings by the Flamboyant were more definite.  The
target had been hit.  They were also certain that the two SDBs and
Fanzheinz class trader were positioning themselves in orbit over
the Flamboyant just inside laser range.
     Then they picked it up.  On the other side of Welles a fusion
plant was climbing to full power; the scout ship they\'d spotted on
the surface was lifting off.
     At Smith\'s suggestion they went over every system of the ship.
Ollie was a clairvoyant telekinetic and had had access to every
part of the ship.  God knows what mischief he might have left
behind.
          - LXXV -
     Jietlshaiepr came to the lounge still in her bathrobe.  The
escape had started during her off watch.  Shtam made his report
first.  The main circuit breakers to the laser batteries had been
pulled.  Hap hazard sabotage, but enough to silence the lasers and
easy enough for the weak strength of low power telekinesis.
     Gresha had uncovered much nastier stuff.  One of the missile
tube indicator lights had been shorted along with the outer door.
If they had opened the tube to reload, the ship would have been
flooded.
     Ens. Smith had rapidly recovered from being throttled, but
Stuzzel\'s larynx had been crushed.  Miakr had taken two slugs in
the chest which Lt. Jones and Vole were removing at the moment.
     "All in all it could have been much worse." admitted
Jietlshaiepr, "Poor Stuzzel, what a bastard..."
          - LXXVI -
     Gresha looked up from the sensors.  "I was right Jiet." her
tail wagged with pride, "They\'re headed out.  All four ships
proceeding to jump point at one G acceleration."
     Jietlshaiepr put her arm around Gresha\'s shoulders and gazed
into the sensor read out.  "Zhdantva!" she breathed, "It\'s over!"
     The pirate flotilla docked with the SDBs at jump point.  The
SDB power plants throttled back to minimum and were lost on their
cometary courses.  Then the two starships jumped.
          - LXXVII -
     The Flamboyant made a brief appearance at Welles Starport.
Captain Billy the third, aged fourteen or fifteen, gave the crew
faint praise for their efforts.  It seemed that the Laramie and the
Bismark had already reported the outcome of the battle.  The
planetary ruler didn\'t seem to care overly much who had won the
battle, just as long as he didn\'t have to worry about it.
     Now that Fleet Admiral Colorado had died aboard the Pasadena,
the Captain had lost his regent.  The next in line was the
hereditary Fourth Officer of the Warsaw, Commander Loren
Farnsworthy, captain of the Bismark.
     Fortunately, Commander Farnsworthy was far more capable than
the hereditary Captain.  She would see to the reconstruction of the
planet, and promised Jietlshaiepr that The League of Suns was not
the only place help would be appealed to.  The Zhodani Consulate
Embassy would be appealed to.  The Droyne crew would stay as
unofficial Consular representatives while awaiting the return of
the Chekbas.  They were, after all, Consular citizens, and the
Droyne cruiser would carry the formal request for aid to the sector
capitol at Massina.
     The League of Suns, however, was much closer and could render
aid more swiftly and would be very interested in strengthening its
borders.  Still, Farnsworthy did not seem to be one to let her
planet be annexed by friend or foe (all the better for the distant
Consulate.)
     The captured grav tank was handed over to the locals as a
joint gift from the League and Consulate lest their antagonists
return.  It could not be carried by the Flamboyant, though the
captured Air/Raft hardly made up for the loss of the Viper and the
VIXEN.
          - LXXVIII -
     "Well, whot\'s yer next move, Jietlshaiepr?" asked Lt. Jones.
     "Oh, we\'re going to see if anything is salvageable from the
VIXEN, if we can find it.  It was left adrift.  It may still have
some useful material aboard."
     "An\' then?" prompted Ens. Smith.
     "I don\'t really think you need to know that." smiled
Jietlshaiepr, "Mostly I\'ll be glad to leave before your rescue
party can show up and detain us.  But after we leave I see no
reason for you to know where we go.
     "It has a been pleasure working with you," she continued while
shaking hands with them, "but now I must leave."
     Jones smiled.  "Till we meet again..."
     He paused and left the last words unspoken, "On Zylath..."

Hum.

Well, speaking as a physics oriented sci type m\'sef, I can
speculate as to why we get into physics more often than we do
into psionics, and even exo-biology, exo-psychology, chemistry,
engineering.  Because, in the above fields we have too many
variables to deal with.  A ref can always arbitrarily come up
with a wierd biology that \'does THIS neato thing\'.  We can
imagine big nasty semi-intelligent beasties with acid for blood
that some how just happen to require humans as a host to
reproduce in.
     Ok, that\'s an extreme case.  But you see, the ref can always
come up with a wierd chemistry or biochemistry or even
engineering solution that has X,Y,Z strange effects.  Physics is
much more fundamental.  There are a lot fewer laws to deal with,
and it is much easier to determine that effects R,S,T are
possible, but U,V,W are not.  The bets get hedged when you head
into the other areas.

But, that is not to say that we can\'t or shouldn\'t talk about
wierd bio-chemistry and other stuff.  Indeed sometimes us poor
non-bio types can get a lot of neato ideas from hearing about a
particularly weird animal... I remember a discussion off line a
while back on some kind of wierd frog that carried it\'s young
tadpoles around *Under* the skin of the female.  When they were
\'born\' hundreds of these lil suckers ripped their way out through
the skin of the female.  BLEAH!  ICK!  :-P

This is the sort of thing that inspires refs ta come up with el
wierdo creatures to make our poor players wake up screaming the
night after the game...  So, Paveway, if you got any ideas like
that I\'d *love* to hear \'em... |->

that it is a pseudo-bio of a human, but if not, boy!  That cud be

When I have played Traveller in the past, it has typically been with
people who have Engineering, Math, Computer Science, or Physics
backgrounds.  These are the sorts of questions my players ask, and so I
have had to come up with answers.  In many cases, the answers have
needed carefull thought, because the players will try to misuse the
technology in the *WORST* ways.

On the other hand, role-playing is really just an advanced form of story
telling.  As a referee and as a player, you do what you have to to
suspend disbelief for a little while.  In my case, breaking the laws of
physics brings the players jarring back to Earth in the worst way.

The people you play with may be quite different; after all, most
science-fiction novels are not so rigorous with the laws of physics as
many TML-ers are with Traveller.  If your players don\'t care, then gloss
over these things and concentrate on the things that do interest them,
and provide detail where its needed (presumably, alien biology and
ecosystems).

You mention that the Traveller ecosystem generation system (such as it
is) is hosed.  In what ways, and are there any easy (or even
not-so-easy) ways to fix it?

Well, "role-playing" is kind of vague.  Do you have any specific
questions or topics you would like to concentrate on?

As a rule of thumb, the players will tend to follow the referee\'s lead.
If the referee starts acting in character, the players will tend to
follow, as in the examples below:

LACK of ROLEPLAYING:
Ref: Finally find the right office; you walk in, step up to the clerk\'s
     desk.  He looks tired and irritable.  He asks you what you want.
You: I tell him.

MUCH BETTER:
Ref: You finally find the right office.  You walk in.  There is a clerk
     sitting at the desk, doing a crossword puzzle.
     <looks up from table, at players, with a tired frown>
     <irritably> "What do you want?"
You: We need a waiver for landing clearance at the downport.

Other techniques I have used include an AT award at the end of every
gaming session for "best role-playing", as decided by a vote of the
players (referee reserves the right to break ties or otherwise
intervene).

}    Speaking of which.....  Remember the alien romance thread
}from am while back?  There is now a pseudobio robot in my
}party...... go figure.

Could be interesting, especially if the robot has highly advanced
emotion simulation programming.  If the \'bot is a player character, I\'d
probably let him or her get away with anything the player could
ratinalize to me.  References should probably include the very early
science-fiction story "Helen O\'Loy", some of Isaac Asimov\'s robot
novels, and of course, "Star Trek: The Next Generation".

the more technical aspects of the MT universe do tend to get a wee bit, well...
nit-picking and dare I say it longwinded.  MT is an SF game and as such it has
some of the standard props of Sci-Fi eg. FTL in the form of the jump drive and
a reactionless drive, your friend and mine the Thruster plate drive.  Now from
my days as a failed A-level physics student I recall that these devices are in
the light of most accepted theory Utter Tosh.  The thing is that there seems to
be a lot of time and energy going into trying to come up with ideas for said
props that conform to our current view of reality, Why?  Is it because for a
physicist it is a grate on the nerves to see bad pseudo-scientific gobbledygook
used to explain the Drives, and you want to explain it better yourselves?
   Why not just accept the drives for what they are.... necessary impossiblities
?   Scott 2G makes the point that the long physics discussions serve to clarify
the effects of technologies.  (I hope thats the point you were conveying I ain\'t
too perceptive today! :) )      This is all well and fine but I have never had
that much trouble with the technology in MT needing over much explaination,
You have a jump drive that you put fuel in and push a button.... fine
The M-drive takes fuel in one end and pushes you along..... Why gild the lily?
  I am lucky though as not one of my party is an Engineer or a Physicist and
therefore there is no-one to really cringe at the howlers in the \'physics\' used
to explain the drives.
	In reply to the point about Physics being easier to discuss than Biology
due to the comparative complexity of the latter....
 I franky disagree,  life is complex, yes  BUT is IMHO easier to deal with in a
SF game than physics.  The Physics in SF deal with acheiving either the
impossible or doing stuff we can\'t manage Yet.  Xenobiology is easier surely? we
have seen what life can do on a planet that can support it (given enough time)
and given the universal rules that govern life we can speculate on what we\'d
find on another world.  I always had my doubts about the Alien in ALIEN, but
if there is a niche to fill then evolution will most likely fill it.  2300ad
is quite good with its Xenobiology, the fact that there is a left or right hand
version of molecules with \'assymetric\' carbon skeletons means that the proteins
and sugars on alien worlds have a 50% chance of not being any use to a terran
lifeform.  Consider the problems the Vilani had with the life on Vland, I reckon
that they had it as good as you can expect.
  I shall start throwing the odd alien into the TML for people to peruse as well
 as a few more whinges on what I don\'t like about the MT universe.

Sigh.  Spoken like a "Physics. The one *true* faith." sci type.

While it\'s true that a ref can "always arbitrarily come up
with a wierd biology that \'does THIS neato thing\'.", it\'s even
more likely that this self-same ref will stick his/her foot in their
mouth if they don\'t have at least a marginal chem/bio background.
(Note that I have the same problem when I attempt handwaving about
drives and powerplants, so don\'t assume that physics is the topic of
choice just because it\'s such a \'pure\' science.)  As for the other
fields (exo-biology, exo-psychology, chemistry) having too many
variables, they\'re no worse than physics, you just don\'t have nearly
as much training in them.  It\'s the same for me and physics.  I bailed
out after three terms and thanked God that I was still alive to talk
about it.  (Besides, as I recall, psychology/psychiatry isn\'t a
science anyway.  It\'s just a matter of "common sense and decency",
right? :^/)

The REAL reason that physics gets discussed in such depth and to the
exclusion of most other topics is twofold.

For the first reason, the following two quotes are appropriate:

	"Defend from the high ground."
			- Charlemagne

	"Always attack from a position of strength."
			- Sun Tzu

There are a disproportionately large number of TML\'ers with strong
physics backgrounds, and it\'s always more fun to argue about a subject
that you think you know better than the other guy.  On the other hand,
those TML members with any training in the life sciences are few and
far between (Eric Sergienko and myself being two exceptions).  There
are obviously enough people interested in physics as it applies to
Traveller to keep the conversations going, even when it\'s boring the
rest of us to tears.  On the other hand, when a chem/bio point of
discussion comes up, there\'s Eric, and then there\'s me.  Consequently,
the two of us resort either to private E-mail or a plain old phone call.

Second, GDW/DGP have made highly visible and, for the most part, abysmal
attempts at providing rules for using TL-15 physics (indirectly) in the
game (jump drives, inertia dampers, artificial gravity, et.al.), which
leave a *boatload* of high-visibility targets for people with good
physics backgrounds to rip apart.  But except for a badly flawed set of
planetary system design rules, and a pitifully sketchy \'random critter\'
creation table, the chem and bio folks don\'t even have anything to try
to fix.  (Note that I\'m also including botany, geology, and a pile of
other fields of study too lengthy to list.)  We have to start from
scratch.  This is a LOT more work than most of us have time for.

That\'s just the tip of the iceberg where Rana (African Treefrog family)
is concerned.  Read "Jurassic Park" (Crichton) or "Legacy of Herot"
(Niven) for some real chillers about frog-like critters, or similar
effects.  If you want wierd animals, you don\'t even have to leave Earth
to find creatures that can lift 30 times their own weight, spit live
steam, excrete caustic chemicals, or survive being frozen in a block
of ice for over three months.  That\'s plenty wierd enough without
inventing space monsters with heretofore unheard of biologies.

The bottom line is, it doesn\'t matter whether it\'s physics, biology,
chemistry, or pottery.  If you attempt to \'hand-wave\' in a subject
where you know less than one (or more) of your players, you shouldn\'t
be surprised when you get bit in the ass by you spontaneous invention.
This is why I keep pushing that tired old saw "research your area of
pseudo-expertise" to death before the game starts.  It can save you
a lot of grief.  (A variety of E-mail from earlier this summer would
suggest that the approach of "knowing what you\'re talking about" is
not a popular one with some TML members.)

The problem is that some of them can\'t be made to conform to our current view
of reality, but something equally useful can.  FTL travel apparently causes
trouble with the Theory of Relativity, but Traveller won\'t travel far without
it, so people generally accept that one.  Reactionless drives definitely
cause problems with Relativity and Conservation of Energy, and even I who
never took physics beyond high school can prove it on paper.  (Or on a VDU,
if you want.)  Reactionless drives are also completely unnecessary.  What
upset a lot of people is that there is no reason for using them, when a
good old reaction drive will do just as well.  It\'s sort of like trying to
use an alien which eats a modest amount, never excretes, and outruns
an antelope.

A lot of us started with the original Traveller, which tried to keep magic
boxes like that to a minimum.  It still had a few (jump drive, for a start)
because they were necessary for an interstellar SF game.  But MT is full
of them, and some (e.g. the reactionless drive) are not necessary.

That\'s just it.  Traveller tried to keep the impossible bits to a minimum.
MT doesn\'t care what is possible.

Good.  That will make a change from all the vehicle designs.  :-)  Do you
fancy writing some alien design rules?  :-) :-)

Mee too...  Same question.

In writing the next chapter of the 4.5th, I have some concerns,
some might view a bit as ranging from PG-13 to R at the fade out.
But from another point of view, would start at R and head into
the X range.   (Depends on your views of human-vargr relations)

Frankly, I have no intention of going into what *I* consider bad

intention of getting into a "mine\'s-hotter-than-yours" contest
either.  We need good stories, not a Elf Sternberg clone, I don\'t
intend to try, but conversely, I don\'t like limiting myself either.

My intention is to send the scene (when completed) to James for a
preview.  This is probably the best course of action, after all
he is and should be the final judge of what goes out.

we all start figuring out what weird things might be going down in space.
Heck!  Did you know there is SULPHUR based life on *EARTH*?  Weird little
worm critters that metabolize the sulphur compounds at the continental
plates in the oceans.

I know it might sound a little strange coming from one of the physics-addicts,

in the challenges of roleplaying them (and the biology of an alien is not
seperable, in my uneducated opinion, from its psychology).  The biology is
interesting, but the psychology is what really gets me going.  On the other
hand, I\'ll always pick a book of xenopsychology SF (CJ Cherry, Sturgeon) over
a book of the harder physics variety of SF (this isn\'t to say that the science
in Cherry or is bad, because it\'s not - it\'s just that the characters are
_SO_ good).  An alien without a xenopsychology and without a culture is just
another lifeform, \'ya know?  ;-)  So please, if the lifesci-nerds want to
wax eloquent about bio matters, please do so!  I think we could profit by a
better balance.

OPEN MOUTH, REMOVE FOOT

Mark Cook\'s injunction to research PRIOR to stuffing one\'s foot (back) into
one\'s mouth is one well worth heeding (yea, verily, by me too).  Ever since
the discussion on grav belts and free fall and velocity limitations thereto
apertaining, I\'ve been digging out my refs on exposure and other wind-related
injuries, with the aim of posting up a synopsis of what injuries/trauma are
induced at which velocities...but I\'m not done yet (AND I\'m in the middle of
moving, which makes things a little harder than usual because my EMT texts
are in a box _SOMEWHERE_).  What I\'d like to find (and expect to be able to
find at the UCal library) is a ref which details the trauma induced by sudden
acceleration/deceleration (something which NASA did a lot of research on, I
believe).  Then I\'ll really be in business as to having my facts all lined up
and well-behaved.

TML STORY LINES/ROLEPLAYING EXAMPLES

I don\'t think I will ever mind the story lines that people have been posting
on the TML, because the quality has been good, and I also enjoy seeing how
other peoples\' games and characters work.  (You can take that as a yes vote,
Herr Doktor Metlay.)  The point of view of the 4.5th frontier war is a real
good example - before 4.5th, I always thought of the Zhodani as The Evil
Empire(tm).  I won\'t say my opinion (as far as my imperial characters is
concerned) has changed, but my outlook has been broadened.  I\'m also putting
together a robot character, because I liked the way the Imperial Advisor
presented the pseudo-biologicals as characters, and I\'d like to try it myself.

I liked the alternate iron-based pigment. I believe it was called

minor little detail that could make a refs day.

It doesn\'t bind to the "respiratory poisons" that hemoglobin does.
Cyanide was *specificly* mentioned. I\'m sure that the possibilities are

No doubt it is used by life forms on worlds with some sorts of "tainted"

What you probably want is the research done for the Air Force by a Col.
Stapp back in the mid-50s. He\'s the guy in the famous film sequnce of a
man on a rocket sled.

One bit of trivia I recall from someone\'s review of the book (in an old
magazine! I\'m not *that* old!) was the experiments with extremes of
temperature. They had volunteers who endured an air temperature of 450
degrees F for something like an hour. The only damage were burns where
a couple of them had been wearing sweatbands (as I understand, they
were otherwise naked). I\'m fairly sure this was at *zero* humidity!

Picture the fun you can have with trivia like this. Either presenting
the players with a *possibly* survivable situation that they are sure
will kill them, or alternatively, having them trying to deal with a
world labeled "habitable" because some computer somewhere got the data
on "endurable extremes" confused with the data on *livable*.

"But the computer *insists* that humans can survive at those
temperatures..."  :-)

Bruce says:
:[My group is using RADAR as a weapon; the GM lets them.]
:Has anyone any info on this supposed effect?
:Is it useable as a weapon on a regular basis?

Yes, to both questions, within limits.  RADAR is a microwave radio
signal.  By carefully designing your antenna, you can concentrate
the power of your transmitter into semi-coeherent short bursts, and
broadcast it generally in one direction.  RADAR normally works by
timing the difference between when you send a signal and receive it.

[technical aside: if you design your antenna as a resonant cavity, you
can create a truly coherent, single wavelength, beam - aka MASER.  This
will function like a laser weapon, only bigger, subject to the limits
described below.]

Essentially, you just get a big microwave transmitter, and an antenna
that can take the power, and cook your enemies.  Just like the one in
your kitchen, only bigger.  Shrewd users will have the models that
broadcast in the range most absorbed by water.  A normal surface-search
radar is not terribly efficient at cooking sophonts because the frequencies
used tend to be reflected by water--but they will work.

:Why don\'t we use it as a weapon TODAY?  I\'ve never heard of it before in
:real world situations.
:What sort of ranges and strengths and effects are we talking about?
:What defences are there to it?

It\'s bulky.  It\'s heavy.  It\'s nonselective.  It\'s a sitting duck for one
HARM.  That is, one infantryman with a rifle and or shoulder launched
missile will toast thousands of dollars worth of gear.

It\'s easily defeated.  Just wear aluminized clothing.  (i.e. reflec will
work like a champ.  So will almost any vehicle with metal in it.)

It\'s easily spoofed. (Think I used the right word.)  Small changes in
subsurface composition, trees, streams, etc. will scatter and or deflect
the beam in strange ways.  It\'s quite possible (it was at TL7) to wear
armor that makes a person *invisible* to the assigned wavelength.

To do a good job with this puppy, you probably want, say, a ten kW
transmitter capable of a 50% duty cycle in the neighborhood of 300MHz.
Just about any phased yagee antenna whould work, but make sure you have
a good impedance match.  Effective range should be out to a few to a
few tens of km.  Of course you\'ll eliminate life as we know it in the
area.  Kinda like napalm.

Finally, except at short ranges, it is truly inhumane.  It cooks its
targets.  It is not quick.  It is painful.  It does NOT lessen mental
acuity or physical co-ordination.  That is, you\'ve hurt your enemy and
he can still fight you.

If *I* were the GM, I\'d have field day with this.  If your enemy were
advanced, there\'d be an anti-radiation missile knocking on your door
in short order.  (And you *WILL* be detected--these are electronically
NOISY.)  If your enemy were primitive, they\'d hide behind rocks, trees,
and in water (just like normal), making them capable of long (several
minutes) of exposure, during which they would assault your position.

    I\'ve been tring to post to the TML for a while and now that finals are
    over, I finally have time for Traveller. :)

bio Stuff:
- ----
    First, a comment about the recent Bio thread...  I\'m very interested in
    seeing a new "creature creation" system for Traveller, one that is
    more realistic that what\'s in the book even if it requires more thought
    to build a creature.  What I would like to see is a system that lets
    a referee build a complete ecology using a planet\'s UPP.
    You use the UPP to find out the planet\'s athmo/hydrosphere ratings,
    the mineral levels, etc etc, then the basic "weather types" (high-
    altitude storms, great tides, warm air currents, etc).
    From then on you can determine the ecosystem\'s "base", that is, a couple
    of the more important bacteria/viruses/microbes and build up the
    ecosystem from then on trying to fill every niches in the food chain.

    The niches would be determined by the current types of creatures,
    the place of each creature in the food chain decided according to it\'s
    size, metabolism and capacities, for example:
plankton <-- water mammal <- land fisher <- giant trap plants <- decay back
	       \\	       \\- sea birds <- parasitic worms <-/ into sea.
		\\- crustacean <- squid <- ??? (empty niche to be filled)
					\\- ??? (empty niche)

    Also, the niches and types of creatures would be limited by the
    environment, for example the planet\'s land surface might be unhabitable
    for flying creatures (what if the planet is in a constant meteor shower?)
    or ape-likes creatures would be unlikely in a tree-less environment.

    This sounds like a lot of work but I think it would be worth it. :)
    After all, a lot of SF books are only about an ecosystem and we would
    be sure to get an integrated ecosystem.

    The hard part would be to be able to create non-earth-like ecologies
    but if we use a "building blocks" system like this, it could make
    some sense in the end. :)

    Just my, 39 lines\' worth of comments. :)  I\'m not a biologist and
    I only know what I\'ve been taught in high school but this is the
    kind of system I would like to see (or help create :).

Metempsychosys:
- ----

    I thought of making this a psi power, it\'s pretty powerful so take it or
    leave it. :)

    "When a living thing dies, its \'soul\' or psyche takes up a new residence
    in some other body, which it thereby vivifies; for the psyche, bodily
    death means emigration, bodily birth immigration.  That is the ancient
    doctrine of \'metempsychosis\' or the transmigration of the soul."
    "...To some Greeks, at least, it appeared to be an empirical theory;
    and its empirical basis lay in memory"
					-- The Oxford Companion to The Mind

    How should metempsychosys work in MegaTraveller?  Well, the character
isn\'t really re-born (it would involve too many religions and it\'s a touchy
subject:).  What happens is that a character tries to transfer all his
tought-patterns to something that might accept them.

This something is usually an already sentient being, but it can be an animal
or even a sufficiently advanced computer system.  The creature being
transferred to is still using his or her own brain and that the being
transferring there cannot wipe out all the thought-patterns already present
and start from scratch because it would immediately kill the host.
The target\'s regulatory systems (breathing, etc) would receive a shock and
the target would die or fall into a coma.

If the attempt works, the result is a mesh of the two different
personalities living in the target\'s body.  Mental skills and psionic skills
can be transferred to the new body.  The resulting being might feel as if
having two distinct personalities but usually the differing traits smooth
out over time.	Only the major traits of both personalities finally emerges,
but in general, the beings harsh and cunning enough to perform a
metempsychosys usually have a strong personality and in general
end up with almost their original selves and thought-processes in the end.

Metempsychosys should be a very uncommon psionic skill, because it is almost
impossible to train in it. Those who have it are naturally strong in it.
To obtain this skill while at a Psionic Institute, you have to roll an
11+ using the normal procedure (this means you have to try for this skill
first).

When a character wishes to use this skill, he has to concentrate
for one full round without doing anything else.  Then he must spend one psi
point for each point of intellect, education or skill level (only mental
& psi skills, like admin) that he wants to transfer to the new body.

A simple psi-shield is all that\'s needed to prevent invasion. The victim
gets the same type of protection as from a normal psi assault.
Unshielded victims or those without psi-points are immediately affected,
while a person aware of being invaded can spend psi-points to suppress the
points spent by the one transferring, on a one-on-one basis. There are no
other know defenses.  This would be a very interesting skill to use in an
attack if it didn\'t leave the user without psi points and possible brain
damage.

Example: Max Crab is bleeding to death, collapsed on a balcony overlooking
a vast Vilani city.  Victim of a witch hunt, he understands the hopelessness
of his situation when he hears the mob coming closer.  A member of the
lynch mob, Talgan, hopes to calm down the usually peaceful vilani by
doing things in the normal, commonly accepted way and steps boldly before
the prone body, trying to reason with them.
Crab knows there\'s only one thing he can do and he concentrates on the
preaching vland.  He uses his last psi strength to send his whole
consciouseness into the vland\'s and try to dislodge it.  Crab has 11
points left, with which he hopes to transfer 4 points of Int,2 of Edu (he
wants to "remember" some secret plans he\'s heard of... A character\'s
personal memories will be proportional to the number of edu points
transferred), 2 levels of Pilot and 3 of Computer. The vland has 6
psi-strength points.  He pushes back the attack, reducing Crab\'s total
points to only 5. Crab doesn\'t have a choice, and must transfer what he can
for 5 points worth.  He chooses 2 point of education, 2 of Int and 1 of
Computer, hoping that he won\'t end up in a totally impotent bureaucrat.

The results? We know that the vland was a low bureaucrat, relatively
unintelligent and uneducated with int of 5. Crab transferred two points.
The vland\'s TOTAL intelligence is now 7, but a lot of his thinking will be
like Crab\'s fashion because roughly 29% (2/7) of his thought-processes comes
from Crab.  With 7 of Edu to start with, he ends up at 9, so 22% of what he
knows comes from Crab.	Thus, he may not BE Crab but he certainly does
behave like him about a third of the time.

	Since no character\'s abilities can go beyond F, the points
over F must be deducted from the victim\'s side.  For example, a victim has
C Int.	He or she gets transferred 7 Int points.  The total exceeds F by 3
points, so we cut off 3 from C\'s starting intelligence to end up with F Int.
The total int count goes like this: 9 from victim and 7 from transferer.
The intellect is thus 57% that of victim and 43% that of transfered.  These
percentages are good guidelines to build up the resulting personality.

	We\'ve mentionned that even some computers would be able to hold
personalities.	Actually, anything that can hold a living, moving pattern
of forces (in brains, electricity) can be a recipient for a being.  Lo-tech
computers cannot do this. Parrallel computers can, but of course, the
capacities of the new being will be severely limited.  With 8 as an average
psi-strenght (it\'s actually lower than that), that makes for about 4 Int, 2
Edu and 2 Psi (to be able to affect the outside world).  Not much of a
person, and besides, imagine the shock of finding yourself being a pile
of optic cables and memories? An almost bodyless machine?  It might
explain some of those haunted Zhodani ships stories... :)

    This psionic skill might seem out of place in MegaTraveller but this
skill can add a lot of interesting role-playing twists and turns to a game.
Some cults might be built around this psionic power, or someone might
pretend to be the reincarnated Strephon (and promptly get lynched :).


Hope you like it, I hope nobody had done it before and that I get some
comments. :)

	A friend of mine has written a new psi system for traveller, and
it will be available within the next six months or so...  and in it,
Metempsychosis as you call it, would be covered by Projection.  Projection
is the out-of-body excursions the mind can perform as psychic phenomenon.
It is possible for the projectionist to at the point of death, should (s)he
be powerful enough, to break the "silver-cord" that attaches the mind to
the body, and go in search of a new host body.  This body need not be
vacant, as (s)he could quite easily overcome or kill a sap (aka. non-psi).
And this host need not be human either.  For instance a character that I
run disconnected her mind from her old Imperial body, and inhabited an
alien (a race that my GM came up with).  Please note though, that if a
humanoid inhabits a creature with a smaller brain volume, then the mind
will adjust to fit.  So if you want to inhabit a mouse, then expect to
possibly become a sap, and definately lose 80% of your intelligence and
education.  This stops humanoid characters from inhabiting birds and
things, as this would become a little bit powerful.

	Also, should the character wish to inhabit a machine (ie. a robot
mind), then they should have abilities needed above, and also teleptech
(the equivalent of telepathy with computer minds).  Then the mind could
incorperate itself with a computer mind, and even take over it.  I\'m not
very familiar with the rules on teleptech, but I hear that they are very
interesting...

	Transition is usually ok for a seasoned projectionist, as they are
used to extreme changes in bodily condition (ever thought what a body does
when it\'s mind it a couple of parsecs away?  not much, it\'s usually in a
coma like state).  But the body the projectionist leaves suffers huge brain
damage after the character leaves.

	Also, for all those who are not level 12 projectionists, psi drugs
can temporarily make metempsychosis possible, but the body you leave takes
huge amounts of damage when the drugs ware off, as does your mind in the
new body, when you arrive.  For full rules on this, wait until the rules
come out, either from GDW or as Public Domain material should they be
stupid and not publish it.

	It is possible for the character to inhabit an alive and well host,
and hide in the depths of the brain.  This is called possession, but is
usually performed by ghosts. (minds that did not find their way to where
ever minds go when beings die)  This could end up in a person that is
played by two characters.  (eg. a player-character and a
non-player-character)  Usually a wandering mind will have a hard time
inhabiting the body of an active-psi, as defence will be possible for the
host mind.

	As metempsychosis is a level 12 projection ability, it will be very
rare.  And some GM\'s will want to limit it so that after each
metempsychosis, the projection drops one level perminantly.

Regards,

	Mike.

Thanks for the info Richard but...

So far the characters have not been using the RADAR (etc) to "toast" victims
but more along the lines of temporary "short-circuiting" the targets\' minds
causing unconsciousness and vomitting and basically ruining their day.

They quoted some stories about MIGs in Korea doing low level bombing runs and
causing these effects on equipment and staff at US targets.

Nobody has suggested actually building one of your "toasters", they are using
existing equipment on existing vehicles (eg Helicopter and Jet Aircraft).

What sort of effect and at what range can we expect from this standard sort of
equipment?  Obviously they\'re not putting out 10kW.

I\'ve passed your EM on to my GM and he said that it would be very useful.

Re: 4553

Just purchased David Brin\'s  STARTIDE RISING and UPLIFT WAR.  Only a couple of
chapters in so far but its good.

Any other books in the series?


Some thoughts
- ----

1. Your Fleet thunders up towards the enemy Fleet and looses off a salvo of
missiles, lasers, energy beams, particle beams and mesons (in self defence
of course).

And you miss the sucker!  The missiles fly on until their fuel is exhausted
and then drift (OR self destruct).  Your mesons have fallen short or long and
are no more.  But hey, your lasers and energy beams and Particle beams travel
on and on and on.  Does this mean that some poor bugger minding its own
business accidentally gets toasted several years later in a neighbouring
system?

2. In a real fleet engagement are we going to see "line up and shoot" sort of
combat from HIGHGUARD/TCS or is the whole thing going to degrade into
"one (or many) on one" dogfight combat or is it going to be massive formations
ala DOC SMITH or is it just an uncoordinated "free for all" as in STAR WARS?

3. Once the melee starts and the nukes are a firing away, what sort of command
control is going to be left.  The LENSMAN series has their "tanks" showing
all the multi-coloured dots representing ships in battle etc.  What sort of
command control would you expect in a "REAL" hundred (thousand) ship a side
slugfest?

I like the old HIGHGUARD/TCS methods but would like to hear what your thoughts
and experiences have been.  I personally competed in some strategic level
Traveller/HighGuard/TCS campaigns and the "rocks" almost always came out on
top in a defencive roll but whenever the lines of supply were a bit teuous
they ran into all sorts of problems.  These campaigns were for the military
minded and not in the Traveller Universe (I hope).

4. How do you take a planet from a determined enemy on the ground?  From
experience and observation of various strategic campaigns I\'ve seen massive
armies obliterated, atmospheres stripped, viral plagues applied, radiated
rock balls, cometary collisions and simple surrender.

Anybody out there played in some Strategic level HighGuard/TCS campaigns?

Won\'t there be some dispersion of the nasty beam weapons over distance?
Space isn\'t really empty, it contains a little bit of junk that will
effect your mis-aimed weapons.  Also, your chance of hitting a nearby
system is pretty remote (space after all is pretty big).  One possible way
to avoid this problem is to apply an imperial order that all ship to ship
combat shall take place perpendicular to the plane of the 2-D universe :-)

The line up and shoot is a good way to commit suicide.  If you opponent
is busy lining up, you might as well start shooting now.  The high guard
idea was that you commit some of your ships to the front and hold the
rest back as a reserve (which is a pretty good idea).  It then abstracted
away the bulk of the combat stuff.

As for the dog fight idea, I might expect the smaller ships to go into
that mode while the larger ones attempted to stay out of range of the
enemy\'s big ships.

The DOC SMITH formations would be good for displays and so on but would
be much use in combat.  They may be of use when you fleet is travelling
around.  Some kind of formation would have to be used to save stress on
the commander(s) of the fleet.

The uncoordinated "free for all" would be an inefficient usage of your
ships, any kind of cooperation would improve you effectiveness thus
I wouldn\'t expect this mode to occur in any clash except possibly for
small ship dogfights or reguard actions.


I\'d put my vote on fleet combats being very short and very bloody.

Given the lethality of MT ship combat (which is probably under-estimated
anyway), I cannot see ships enguaging head to head.  That would be a sure
fire mutual kill.  Which isn\'t often good for either side.  I\'d expect
real combat to be more of the form, detect them on passive sensors and
blow them away as fast as possible hoping that they don\'t see you in
the process.  The only time you\'d turn active sensors on would be when
you detected the enemy using them or when you needed them for point
defense purposes.

As for how the fleet formation would look, I\'d put my vote on having
the large capital ships as the centre or maybe aft of the centre (with
respect to direction of travel of the fleet).  Then the smaller ships
further out (getting smaller as they get further away from the centre).
Finally, some sensor ships a long long long way out who\'s job it is to
detect the enemy before they detect you.  I\'d also expect the entire
formation to be very spread out becuase (1) small navigation errors
will occur and they shouldn\'t cost ships; (2) it ought to mean that
your smaller (and thus more expendable) craft are around the perimeter
(actualy surface since things are in 3D) of the fleet; (3) it reduces
the chance that two ships will be hit by the same nuke and misses are
less likely to hit something alse.  Point (1) isn\'t all that important in
combat, but even in comabt you\'ll need some space to maneuver.  Point (2)
means that your small ships should have (passive) sensor suites equal
to anything else in the fleet.  It also means that when your fleet is
detected, your small ships are the ones that take the first hits which
preserves your capital ships.  Additionally, the small ships are able
to provide point defence against incoming missiles for the larger ones.
I\'m not sure how important point (3) would be in space since your fleet
is going to have to be very dispersed anyway.

Given this formation was being used, what would the chances be of building
a huge meson screen and a huge nuke damper to protect the entire fleet?
We\'ve seen references to screens for cities (which would be small compared
to a fleet), but with decent defences for your entire fleet you wouldn\'t
have to build the defences into each ship (or at least you wouldn\'t have
to build in as good defences).


>4. How do you take a planet from a determined enemy on the ground?  From

Get a large rock, accelerate it some nice pleasant velocity and chuck
it into the planet.  Wrecks the planet very well but gets rid of the
defenders.  Oh, so you wanted the planet afterwards.  Well, that makes
life much harder.

Meson gun attacks against population centres until they surrender
might work as might destroying the industrial potential of the planet.
But as has been pointed out on this list before, it doesn\'t take that
much effort to make a high population planet a fortress in space -- put
a laser turret into every new building plus some basic passive sensors
on many building and in many places around the globe and have some of
the fabled deep meson gun sites.  Attackers can forget about trying to
overcome your defenses quickly.  They cannot send in the big capital
ships becuase a single sensor platform anywhere on the hemishpere facing
them is going to mean that that ship is dead.

I\'m not sure that a microwave would have this kind of effect on the brain/mind.
What happens (physically) is that the energy from the microwaves is absorbed
by some tissue (usually water or plasma) in the body.  The extra energy becomes
heat.  The organs most susceptible to this effect are in the endocrine system.
(Notably, no more babies. Eric--wanna help me out here?)

Confusion, uncosciousness, vomiting all sound to me like symptoms of radiation
sickness (the radioactivity kind, rather than this kind).  If indeed there were
some way to know for sure that this _actually_ rather than ficitionally happens,
then we\'ve got a good case against TV and radio stations.

As for range, it\'s line-of-sight.  Power generally falls off as 1/r^2 where
r is the distance to the target. It is possible to be in the shadow of some
other target.  Metallic objects bounce the waves around.  Maybe you should
ask your GM to come up with a weapon table for you.  :=)

My personal feeling is "hey-it\'s a game!  If they\'re all having fun, just
make it somewhat self-consistent.  (Don\'t let \'em change the behavior later

1.  What happens to some poor schmo light-years away when you miss with a

Because of dispersion, nothing.  The headlights of car don\'t effectively light
my path beyond a certain distance, because of dispersion.  Lasers and particle
beams are more coherent light sources, but still, the beam will broaden and
lose its power with distance.  After travelling a few light-years, the effect
of the beam will be negligible.

2.  What about fleet tactics in MegaTraveller?

  a.  What about Trillion Credit Squadron/High Guard?

  Of course, this is Old Trav, isn\'t it?  Here, certainly, battles look like
  an Irish Knockdown.  There are three ranges, Short, Long, and Too Damn Long.
  Fighters are ineffectual, and the guy with biggest rocks wins.  Tactics are
  very abstract, and the battle is really between ship designs.

  b.  What about MegaTrav?

  Now we\'re talking.  Although I have never gotten around to doing it, it
  shoudn\'t take too much imagination to see one of these battles.  Now, we can
  actually have formations of ships, encirclement maneuvers, etc.  Important to
  keep in mind that we don\'t have firing arcs and such, as in Starfleet
  Battles, but that makes MT more realistic, not less.  Now, a person with
  inferior ship designs can win due to superior tactics.  Here is an example
  of my tactical ideas.

  First, each side will probably have a reserve force, consisting of those
  vessels each player does not wish to expose to battle.  Tankers, transports,
  and carriers will usually be in the reserve.  In addition, additional forces
  that the player does not wish to expose to battle at this time may be in
  the reserve.  Heavily damaged vessels are often transferred to the reserve, to
  prevent their destruction.

  Second, some screen forces may be deployed to protect the reserve from any
  breakthrough enemy forces.  The screen forces will probably consist primarily
  of destroyers and smaller fry, plus one or two larger ships.  The screen
  forces may be deployed slightly ahead of the reserve forces, to intercept
  breakthrough enemy vessels before they can come within weapons range of the
  reserve forces.

  Third, each side may have a ready reserve, forces which are out of the
  weapons range of vessels in the enemy\'s line of battle, but which can be
  readily transferred from the ready reserve to the player\'s own line of battle.
  Opinions differ as to which vessels should stay in the ready reserve.  I would
  place my capital ships in the ready reserve initially, to prevent them from
  receiving excess damage early in the battle.  It is possible to have the same
  force perform both the screen and ready reserve roles, if necessary.

  Fourth, each side has a line of battle.  These are the ships within weapons
  range of each other.  The most important issue a player must answer is, which
  vessels to place in one\'s line of battle at which time.  Placing all one\'s
  capital ships in the LOB initially may cause them take excessive damage early
  in the battle.  Populating one\'s LOB with only fighters means that your forces
  cannot effectively damage the enemy (as fighters can usually only cause minor
  damage to capital ships), and permit enemy forces to breakthrough your LOB,
  exposing your ready reserve to weapons fire (in effect, suddenly transferring
  all the forces in your ready reserve to your LOB).

  Fifth, each side may have breakthrough forces.  These forces are designed to
  penetrate your enemy\'s line of battle, breaking through to his rear areas.
  The breakthrough forces may then engage the ready reserve, the screen forces,
  or the reserve forces.  This latter usually causes the greatest damage, and
  some ships are designed explicitly to fulfill this role in a battle.  It is
  also possible to avoid the enemy\'s main forces, and attack the enemy\'s flanks
  or rear.  Forces dispatched to play this role are still called breakthrough
  forces, and are the primary reason to have a screen force separate from one\'s
  ready reserve forces.

  On a very abstract level, one\'s forces would be deployed like so:

                 may be one force
                        !
               .---- ----.
   Reserve      Screen      Ready      Line of   Enemy Line   Breakthrough
    Forces      Forces     Reserve     Battle    of Battle       Forces  -->
  (optional)  (optional)  (optional)                           (optional)

  The placement of titles is not intended to convey a sense of scale, and
  represents the order in which the forces appear only.

  In practice, their may be one or more of each of the above forces on a side
  at a time.

  On the issue of what vessels to place in the line of battle initially, I would
  deploy a limited number of capital ships plus a substantial number of escort
  and fighter craft, holding my main force of capital ships and cruisers in the
  ready reserve.  If the enemy responds with his capital ships, the escorts and
  fighters will cause such damage as they can, while my capital ships remain
  undamaged.  Therefore, when I at a later time do comit my capital ships to my
  line of battle, they will have the advantage over the enemy\'s vessels.  On the
  other hand, if the enemy refuses to place his main force in the line of
  battle, I will commit a limited number of heavy ships plus a much larger
  number of smaller fry to attempt to break through the enemy\'s line of battle
  and attack his ready reserve, thus accomplishing the same goal.

  The actual manner of deployment of the individual forces is up to the player.
  It is in this area that the question of formations arises, a matter I have
  too little practical experience to speak on.

It WON\'T be "line up and shoot".  In my TCS campaign, about half the

(or many) on one dogfight combat".  No-one uses "free for all", and
no-one is really depending on line of battle.  Not after Amondiage

Large Holo Displays would provide wonderful "tanks".  I personally
expect that in a major fleet action, you would have a flagship like the
Terrans used in "People of the Wind" - big and tough enough that no-one
would willingly fight it.  It didn\'t even TRY to fight, it just acted as
an impregnable command post for coordinating the other ships of the
fleet in a battel that lasted days, and was spread all over a solar
system...

There are ways to protect your planets from "dinosaur killers".  Not
many, but a few.  My experience has been that offensive operations were
EXTREMELY difficult, except with the most limited objectives.  Defensive
operations are easy, unless the enemy is content to render your planet
uninhabitable in passing.  Then they are next to impossible.  However,
offensive operations do NOT become easier when sterilizing planets along
the way - you are still a LONG way from repairs/reinforcements even if
every world between here and there glows in the dark...

You either sterilize the planet, or don\'t take it without mind-boggling
casualties.  In my campaign, two worlds have planetary defenses that
make assaults suicidal - they can be destroyed, but not conquered.
Fortunately for one of them, he came to his senses before committing his
planetary assault forces to an invasion of the other...

The other worlds SHOULD have defenses like that.  Some are trying to
build them, some are betting on their fleets.  Previous experience tells
me that the fleets won\'t be able to do it alone, but one of these bright
young lads might surprise me again...

Problem number one for this sort of defence is that one can easily build
streamlined, heavily armoured ships that will snigger at lasers.

Problem number two is that it will probably be impossible.  Try imagining
the same idea converted into real life, present day.  "It doesn\'t take much
effort to make the U.S.A. into one huge fortress - put an AA gun onto every
new building plus some basic sensors on many buildings and in many places
around the country, and have a few ICBM silos."  Then imagine a politician
trying to get elected with a promise to fit every house with its own 20mm
cannon, along with a tax bill to pay for it.  Of course, the fact that the
U.S.A. isn\'t actually at war with anyone (yet) makes such a proposal
difficult, but if you wait until you are at war, it will be too late.  The
same goes for the high-tech planet.

Of course, a dictatorship could implement such a policy more easily, as
long as the dictator trusted the people not to take over all those guns
and have a revolution - which they might be inclined to do, given the
taxes the dictator has just levied.  You\'ll note that even Saddam Hussein
doesn\'t have AAA on every building in Baghdad.

The first thing an invader would probably do is try to find all the planet\'s
power sources using his neutrino sensors, and give them all some free mesons.
If the invader doesn\'t have both the technology and the big force needed to
do this, he can probably forget the invasion anyway, because the defender\'s
SDB force will deal with him before he gets near the planet.  Without power,
those deep site meson guns are just holes in the ground.

	Well, if no-one thinks it would be a waste of bandwidth, I\'ll start
posting such whenever they get all the way across the Islands...

	As to the "war", it\'s over.  More or less.  Maybe.  But the *other*
war seems to be heating up.

	The starport bombing incident was actually two separate incidents.
Early in "the war" (Officially the Old Islands War.  The "other war" is
officially the Topas War (names assigned by players, but made "official"
by my use of them in my records)), Amondiage sent two fleets out to raid
the enemy home systems.  In Neubayern, the fleet appeared at the 100
diameter limit, accelerated toward the planet, fought the Neubayern
Fleet in passing, and carried out a nuclear bombardment of the starport,
associated shipyards, and associated industries.  They then jumped away
(those that were able).  The entire attack lasted 154 minutes from the
appearance of the raiding force to the jump of the last ships.  In this
time, they killed around 200,000,000 people who had the misfortune to
live near a target area, and reduced Neubayern\'s starport to "B", and
shipyard capacity by half.
	At about the same time (one day earlier by my records), the second
Amondiage fleet arrived in New Home system, and engaged the New Home
System Squadron.  Since most of New Home\'s fleet was elsewhere (beating
up on Sansterre\'s fleet in St Genevieve), the System Squadron was
soundly trounced.  Then about one-half Amondiage\'s survivors carried out
a raid against New Home\'s starport exactly like that against
Neubayern\'s.  Differences:  New Home has IMPRESSIVE planetary defenses.
All but a handful of the attacking ships were destroyed, though not
before New Home\'s starport/shipyards/industries were trashed to a degree
similar to those on Neubayern.
	Simultaneously (as much as such is possible over interstellar
distances, which is to say *NOT*), New Home and Neubayern\'s main fleets
were pounding Sansterre\'s fleet into grape jelly at St Genevieve.
	One week later, Sansterre\'s System Squadron was defeated by a
combined attack force from New Home and Neubayern, and Sansterre
surrendered.
	Two weeks after that, Amondiage\'s fleets caught Neubayern\'s 2nd
Strike, 3rd, 4th, and 2nd Assault Fleets dispersed throughout St
Genevieve system, and trounced them, capturing a *whole bunch of ships*
(details must be kept secret, as not all affected players know the full
truth of that engagement yet).

	Shortly thereafter, the warring parties agreed to a cease-fire, and
met on New Home to discuss terms of a permanent Armistice.  During the
ensuing discussions, the players completely lost their grips on reality,
and ironed out an Alliance, but forgot to do the Armistice.  So New
Home, Neubayern and Sansterre are now allies, even though technically
they are still at war with each other.  Amondiage is technically at war
with New Home, Neubayern, and, by extension, their Alliance.  So,
technically, Amondiage is at war with his ally Sansterre, too.

	The Topas War isn\'t really much of a war.  Serendip Belt grabbed
Topas from Neubayern (who grabbed it early in the game), and the two of
them have squabbled about it since.  Serendip Belt\'s army is busy
grinding up Neubayern\'s army on Topas, and there has been only one fleet
action.  When Serendip Belt attacked Neubayern\'s army on Topas,
Neubayern\'s Topas System Squadron (as opposed to Serendip Belt\'s Topas
System Squadron, and New Colchis\' Topas System Squadron) attacked the
Belter force in an attempt to insert some fighters into the ground
battle (so as to keep Serendip Belt from totally controlling the air
over the battlefield).  The fighters were successfully inserted, and
both forces suffered heavy losses.  Neubayern\'s Topas System Squadron
was forced out of Topas system as well...

	As to "Jane\'s", I am currently putting together the 5628 issue,
which will include more information about the ships that actually
fought, as well as information about the new ships being built at
various yards around the Islands.  I\'ll send you a copy when I get
done.  Which may be several weeks yet.  Patience.  I won\'t forget...

You seem to assume that your light stuff can pound his heavies, but that
his can\'t pound yours.  Isn\'t there an internal contradiction here?  If
your fighters and escorts can pound his battleships that much, don\'t you
think his escorts and fighters will do a similiar job on your own
heavies when they are committed?  You also place too strong an emphasis
on specific roles.  You ignore the detail that an enemy ship can fire
PAST your ships into your reserve.  Unless it is out of weapon range of
the main battle.  But that leaves it almost two hours travel from the
battle.  Which is plenty long enough for your "battle line" to get
pounded into scrap while the "reserves" move up to assist.  Keep in mind
that the concept of "reserves" evolved to deal with limited intelligence
on the battlefield.  Since any of your ships can detect any enemy ships
on the battlefield, the need for reserves to counter enemy surprises
goes toward zero.  And enemy weaknesses can be exploited real well by
shifting front-line forces laterally (as was amply demonstrated in
WW1).  In fact, there is seldom any good reason to keep any functional
warship out of combat in HG/MT - all it does is give the enemy local
superiority over the forces you DID commit, without giving you any real
advantage later.  Notice that Games Theory works wonderfully well for
analysing a HG/MT battle, since it assumes that any unit can hit any
other unit in the battle...


Paul Dale:

What is the point of staying out of range of the enemy\'s big ships, when
by definition that means that his big ships are out of range of your big
ships?  If neither side is willing to risk their big ships in combat,
you might as well save money and never build them in the first place.

"I can\'t risk *that* ship!  It\'s my best one!"  ---- far too many

>I\'d put my vote on fleet combats being very short and very bloody.

Unlikely.  When a solar system takes days to weeks to cross, and ship
velocities may be thousands of Km/s different, fights will frequently
last weeks.  Read Poul Anderson\'s stories set in the Terran Empire or
Polesotechnic League for a good look at battles throughout a solar
system.  And his ships could pull dozens to hundreds of G\'s.  Traveller
ships can make six, at best...

I wouldn\'t expect to see active sensors at all.  Why bother?  MT makes
passive sensors better than active in every way.  It overlooks or
ignores the deficiencies of passive acquisition, and generally makes
active sensors a waste of time and money.

And now for MY view of "formation".  There are two types of ships worth
having in any combat "formation": big, agile fighters, and small, agile
spinal-mount riders.  Or big, agile fighters and big, agile battleships,
if meson weapons aren\'t available.  "Formations":  go where you will,
and stomp anyone who gets in front of you.  If you find yourself heading
toward a local concentrationof enemy forces, call on all your brother
and sister ships to help pound them.  Fighters should ALWAYS accompany
battleships/riders, since they can, if properly designed, avoid most
damage while still dishing out a lot.  The battleship/riders are going
to be used to get crits, while the fighters peel the enemy like a grape.

You should not get locked into the idea that the fight is going to be
two small clumps of ships fighting "over near that planet".  The battle
may very well consist of hundreds of small groups spread throughout the
solar system, all trying to get enough local superiority to gain a
little here or there.  And holding your fleet in one big clump that is
too tough to attack mostly means it is in the wrong place, since the
enemy doesn\'t HAVE to come to you - he can refuel and go on to the next
solar system (remember that there is seldom only ONE refueling spot in a
system).


>Given this formation was being used, what would the chances be of

>entire fleet?

	Well, using High Guard, which I have in hand (MT uses essentially
the same power requirements), a meson screen that will encompass a
sphere 5000Km in diameter would require on the close order of 2E19 MW.
Which translates to a fusion plant 1200Km or so in diameter.  I doubt
you can do much with that idea.
	Nuclear Dampers, on the other hand, have a constant power
requirement.  Maybe having one generator on each of two different ships
as far apart in your formation as possible would allow one set of
dampers to protect any ship between the two vessels.  Food for
thought...

As I understand it, everything that Richard has said to date is correct.
Microwave/radar energy takes a long time to kill a person, say in
contrast to kinetic energy in the form of something like a bullet.
The question is, however, can it screw up your squash (aka your
noggin).

Just like anyo ther tissue, the brain contains water, water heats
up, proteins denature, enzymes and neurotransmitters unravel and
things don\'t work as well as they used to, right?

This doesn\'t appear to be borne out by numerous studies carried
out largely by the Soviets (how this ties into our embassy in
Moscow being bombarded with microwave energy during the 70\'s
is unknown to me :-)).  Incidental exposure to large radar arrays
even at the range of a few meters did not cause any immediate
effects aside from the feeling of warmth.  However, long term
subjective complaints of short term memory loss seem to be borne out
by objective testing.  This conclusion was not supported by all studies.

An interesting case study involved a US Air Force pilot who stood for five
minutes in front of an F-16 which had its radar on.  Again the only
complaint at time of exam was head and neck warmth.  He developed a nodule
on his neck after about three days, and also complained of short term
memory loss.  The short term memory loss was subjective only, and not
supported by testing.  The nodule turned out to be swollen muscle
and cartilage, indicating a cell rupture.

The only death from radar that has been documented occurred in 1957.
The patient died of massive breakdown of the GI tract, and it
took him several days to do so.

SO, at least with TL 8 radar arrays, there does not appear
to be the critical acute effects claimed by Bruce\'s cohorts.

Now there are some interesting court cases coming up where some
cops are suing their respective departments and a radar gun co.
for causing them to suffer testicular cancer.  This is claimed to
occur because the cops left the radar on while the gun was sitting in
their laps.  Stayed tuned.

In other TML news, I promised to say that Scott Kellogg successfully
reached San Antonio.  He promises to be inflicting us with more
vehicle designs soon.

One of these days (right), I\'d like to pursue the bio thread.
People must be really energetic if they want to design an entire
ecosystem.  Especially, if you consider that a lot of PhDs have
spent their lifes studying one niche.  Could be fun :-).

Hasn\'t the past couple of weeks of TML mail been discussing shooting "down"
from orbit pointed out that lasers are next to useless in atmosphere?  MT
laser weapons don\'t appear to do enough damage to deter a detemined attack
and once they\'re in your atmosphere you really don\'t want to use your nukes.

The first couple of nukes would be a big morale problem for your population
and the site of enemy ships in the atmosphere would cause panic.


 . Lewis T Goss gives a possible method of carrying out space combats.

The closest thing we have TODAY to 3d combat is aerial dogfights.  If you
add in a carrier then you\'ve got a reserve/coordinator but its not really
safe.  I was once told that there was a major flaw in the US Carrier Fleet
wargame simulations in that Carriers were _unsinkable_.  Sure you could
damage them but not sink them.  My strategy for taking them out would have
been to send out scouts, get a rough idea of where they were based on scout
losses to carrier based fighters and then layout a pattern of ICBMs or Cruise
missiles to ruin there day.  Anyway thats drifted off the topic but the
formations in MT will have to be 3D and the larger the area you cover the less
force you have to use in any one spot and the longer the time it takes you
to react to activity with your reserves.

HIGHGUARD/TCS (and I suppose MT as well) are geared towards the philosophy
of "You go out there and kick ass" or "run away".  If you can\'t do the first
and you can\'t do the second then you either surrender or waste your military
in a glorious last stand.  The battle formations don\'t appear to be very
valid in that you really want EVERYTHING in there because every weapon and
missile COUNTS.  Even that laser turret on that transport can help shoot
down incoming missiles or help strip turrets fom enemy ships.

Get there firstest with the mostest.


 . Adrian Hurt points out that the first thing that an invader would do is try
 . to find and destroy all the defenders power plants.

Surely, if the defender has a decent number of meson silos then the attacker
won\'t get a lot of opportunity to hit the power plants unless the defender
is significantly out gunned/shipped/siloed.  Also, I would have made each
silo self sufficient with its own intrinsic power plant.  Buried deep
enough you wouldn\'t have much to detect, would you?  Of course you could
use spies but I think it would be difficult to sneak a fleet into orbit
without the planet knowing they were nasty people and should be shot at.

A friend of mine is a WWII nut and was telling me that the Allies did not
intentionally target power sources (DAM Busters was a dramatic exception and
if carried out properly to get all the Ruhr Dams would have been a major
blow to German war effort instead of the nuisance it actually was).  This was
apparently true of the German/Soviet side of the war.  Everyone was real keen
to clobber civilian and industrial targets but not the power plants.  Can
anyone shed some light on this?

Wouldn\'t it be easier to pre-scout a planet with spies and such and then
after wiping the system clean of defending ships you simply drop nukes on
each military base via THOR delivery systems (or missiles) and then ask
them to surrender.  You don\'t need to get very close to the planet to deliver
these weapons so they won\'t get a decent shot at your forces and you would
bring enough ammo to overwhelm their anti-misile defences.  After all, they
arre just sitting targets.  Its not as if the base can dodge the attack.
Sure they could evacuate the site and disperse to pre-arranged defence
positions but the loss of those bases and the broadcasts from space saying
that the next target will be ABC and then destroying it will tend to throw
the civilians (and government) into a panic.

 . Steve points out that a 5,000 Km diameter meson screen would require 2E19 MW
 . and a 1,200 Km diameter fusion plant.

What about an anti-matter power plant?

But then I think its impractical to have a large meson screen because your
enemy can get inside it (do your ships have individual screens too?), you
would have a terrible time firing your meson guns (all synchronised?) through
the meson screen flicker (do they flicker to allow you to shoot out?).

How would you handle 3+ enemy fleets (all enemies to each other)?


Command Control
- ----

Ignoring (for the moment) the formations used in space combat; what sort of
command control are you going to have once the nukes start going off (causing
communications disruptions etc) and ships are fighting for their lives.  We
have never had a REAL nuclear war here on Earth so we only have all these
theoretical problems/solutions.

In HIGHGUARD/TCS you count the number of missiles in your fleet and select a
target and blow it away in a combined attack.  If you calculate out that
you can mission kill 2, 3, 4+ plus of them with missiles then you allocate
them accordingly and its just a stastics calculation as to who will win.n
the big battle.  Providing of course that you know exactly what each side
has.

No battle plan survives first contact.

You seem to be ignoring a few key details here:

Mm... I\'m not too sure about this OOBE, "silver-cord" stuff. :)   Everything
I\'ve learned about the mind and brain up to now tells me that a great deal
of the "mind" is a secondary effect of a brain\'s structure; no structure, no
mind.  (Sure this is psionics, imaginary stuff, so we can make it what we
like :)
In my opinion it means that Clairvoyance/audience/othersense is not a
projection of the mind but instead a projection of the mind\'s eye to the
place to "sense" or the other way around.  Metempsychosis would be the only
"total" projection of the mind there is and it would be projected into
another structure.  The mind would survive if the other structure is similar
and adequate enough.

That sounds good. :)  But I think that a difference of up to 20% less brain
volume shouldn\'t matter too much, as all homo sapiens don\'t have quite the
same brain volume but it doesn\'t prevent some "smaller-brained" to be
geniuses (might be caused by the smaller transmission time inside the brain)
 ...
Also there\'s the "theory" that we don\'t use all of our brain capacity,
so in theory a smaller brain would be able to perform just as well as a
redundant, bigger one...
Except that there might be some secondary effects (likelier to develop
delusions, less memory, less concentration, less capable to hold onto many
different frames at the same time...)

I don\'t see why GDW would be really interested in an elaborate Psi system
since Psis tend to be hush-hush, pushed out of the way stuff in most
Traveller races and too much Psis can make the game less military/hard-sf

How many ICBM silos does the USA have?  The tax payers did foot the bill for
building them.  The same is true of the (former) USSR, but they didn\'t get
quite as much of a choice in the matter.  I\'ll admit that putting a battery
in every building is a bit excessive but sprinkling lots around the planet
isn\'t too bad.  Once, war breaks out you are too late.  However, if you
predict the war and can convince the people that it is likely to happen
then installing such \'defensive\' measures isn\'t going to cause that many
problems (look at the cold war years for an example of this, those bloody
commie bastards are going to destory our enlightened way of life therefore
we must have bigger and better weapons to destroy them first :-).

>Without power, those deep site meson guns are just holes in the ground.

Trading one spinal capable ship for each power source sounds like a pretty
bum deal to me.  All the planet would have to do now would be to build
many small fusion power plants rather than a few big ones.  Once you reach
a minimum size, scale efficiencies no longer improve and the way the design
rules work, there is no constant cost to pay (which is pretty stupid).  You
could always say that large civilian plants have a better efficiency and
recreate this problem.  Putting a power plant with the deep meson site won\'t
be all that difficult either, power plants are relatively cheap.  Also, if
you don\'t start your power plant until there are capital ships in range
you won\'t get destroyed until after you\'ve got one (or maybe two).  Batteries
or fuel cells are an expensive alternative too.



Steve Higginbotham writes:

>If neither side is willing to risk their big ships in combat,

Your own comments later (which I deleted in this reply) provide the
answer to this one.  You suggest big fighters/small spinal riders when
meson weapons are present and big fighters/big capital ships when they
are not.  That is you wouldn\'t build big ships if meson weapons are available.

Why is this?  Becuase the big ships are useless when faced with a couple
of riders that can (& will) kill them in the first exchange of fire.
Without meson weapons, big ships can survive long enough to make
themselves useful.  In fact, a big ship is good because you don\'t suffer
the freebie hits from large spinal PAs and your armour will protect you
from everything else quite well.


>"I can\'t risk *that* ship!  It\'s my best one!"  ---- far too many
>wargamers for my taste.

You\'re too right about the too many wargames bit.  But I think in
traveller there is some justification for this line of reasoning.  I did
the analysis for high guard a long time ago and basically, put two ships
with large meson spinals (factor >J ??) and they will quite effectively
fry each other.  I believe that the same result will convert over to MT
once sensor tasks have been performed (given lots of small cannon-fodder
small ships around assuming that one of them has managed to get a lock
isn\'t too much to ask).  I think that it will be even easier in MT since
the new design system has made agility harder to get.  The only time
mutual kill is good is when you can better afford the casualties than
your enemy.

[ I think factor J gave kill if hit and you needed a bigger factor to
  make the hit more likely.  I don\'t have my trav books at work, so
  I cannot regenerate the figures.  If you go to two on one the one
  is going to look very sick after the first salvo. ]

I stand corrected, I should have written \'ship combats\'.  Once the big ships

Black globes also have a constant power requirement.  A planet
sized black globe ought to be enough to delay the invasion a while.
One idea I\'ve toyed with is building a huge ship in a very thin/long
needle configuration which will provide a huge volume surrounded by its
globe/damper/meson screens and might even provide the small ships with
some defence.

Finally Bruce writes,

I believe that the enemy will be hard pressed to get close to the atmosphere
let alone into it.  The range of starship weapons is quite impressive.  It
should be possible to overwhelm the defences of the planet by sending lots
and lots at it, this way you ought to be able to nuke the population enough
to sap their will.

A being\'s mind originated in the being\'s brain, so any change in size is
relative to the original brain size.  Also, any change is permanent, so
if a character inhabits a mouse, and then inhabits a larger creature
(if it is at all possible), then the stats will not revert to normal.
They will stay that of the mouse...

It is possible for a midget human to be very intelligent, but have a smaller
brain, so the trasition to a mouse would have slightly less of an effect.

Consider the mind as the personality, then the brain might be the machinery
that enables the mind to work.  Some minds (very few) are able to function
without the machinery, but these minds would be very powerful.  Should this
mind be confined to an alien, smaller brain, then functionality would be
sacrificed.  Active psionic beings use nearly all their brain, where as
us saps use merely half (or less).  Perhaps some animals would be mentally
psionically inoperable.  Hence a being who inhabits such a brain may lose
nearly all their powers, regardless of relative brain sizes.

Along with the loss of mental/psionic abilities, would be the possibility
of mind damage.  Lost memory, senses, etc.  But there is also a slight
chance of gaining abilities in the new host, that were not available to
the original host eg. various optical modes.  But this would take time
to get used to.  If a host creature naturally sees in IR, then the
invading projectionist would be mostly blinded until (s)he learned to
decipher the optical patterns.

The value of a warship that is never used in combat is Zero.  There is NO
justification for building a ship that will not be used in combat.  If that
particular ship is too valuable to risk, it is also too costly to build.
{What is the profit-loss ratio of an item of value 0 and cost high?  Pretty
much the same as a value 0 item with cost low - 0}
Yes, two meson-gun-armed ships can fry each other quite effectively.  So
what does this have to do with whether they should be risked in combat?  If
you don\'t want to risk it, make it PERFECTLY safe : DON\'T BUILD IT!

Blak globes are artifacts.  You don\'t have all that much choice about
the size, I would imagine...
As to the "very thin/long needle configuration", unless it were several
thousand Km long, it wouldn\'t provide any useful coverage for other ships.
Unless your ships are travelling REALLY close together.  Far closer than
is reasonable at hundreds of Km/s velocity.

That was merely a guideline to cover the fact that humans of similar
mental ability have different size brains.  It would be a fair comment
to say that a mind is at home is it\'s original brain, which is what I
meant here.  The fact that brain downloading is not available until
TL21 or there abouts (see Referee\'s Companion), means that no imperial
citizens would normally be able to do this...  Anyway, not many people
would want to be uploaded to a computer system, as not all people are
computer nuts (like us...).

Actually, you would not change at all, your computer with your personality
would be the entity that would experience this.  Your entire memory
would just be dumped in to a giant expert system.  (a Richard Johnson
expert in this case...)

Correction, "The Ancients" uploaded personalities to their worker robots
psionics and all...  You obviously have not done the "..Secret of the Ancients"
adventure.  I won\'t go in to detail as some people may not have been through
that one.  Look in the Referee\'s Companion, in the Technology Level tables
under medicine (i think).  There are high TL brain transfers, and the such.
It seems straight forward to me that Psi is conbtained in the unused portion
of the brain/mind... 63% unused?  Hence a full brain dump will process this
data along with the rest of the memories.  But a certain level of technology
must be achieved for this to be possible...

Microwave RADAR as a weapon.

Ok, now, in order to get a radar system to do what Richard and Eric are
talking about (cooking the enemy) you are going to need some heavy duty
power to do so.  Comparable to intensities found in your good old
microwave oven.

Ok, now, I never took a Jackson course, but I have talked to those who
have.  Specifically one of my old profs who kinda liked to play around
with putting coiled copper wire into the oven.  What happened, was that
the wire would be driven by the microwaves, and induce a rather strong
current along the wire.  The wire would overheat and burn.  The flame
produced would dance around inside the oven, and had a strong tendancy
to be pulled up to the top of the machine.

What was happening, was the microwaves were setting up a VERY strong
EM field.  The flame (low temp plasma) was being affected by that field.
The field drew the plasma up to the microwave emmitter.  Consequently,
the emmitter was being blasted with flame.

Ok, now let\'s imagine this system deployed as a weapon.  The EM field
is going to act as a waveguide.  It will draw any plasma up to the
source of the field.

So, assuming, that your opponants don\'t have reflec, or combat armor
or some sort of insulation around them, or don\'t have a few radar
seeking missiles hanging around, but they DO have a plasma gun, all
they would have to do is point it vaguely at the target, and the
plasma bolt will be drawn up to the emmitter.  FRAZK!

Oh, BTW, Eric, a friend of my father\'s was one of the unfortunates who
was in the US embassy in Moscow when the Soviets were bombarding the
place with microwaves.  Two years ago, he suddenly developed cancer and
died within a few weeks.  I believe there was some speculation as to the
source of the cancer being related.  I\'ll look into it.

	Does ANYONE have any DIRECT evidence of that \'humans only use 10% of

	As far as I know, that\'s an urban legend. Anyone you are likely to ask
has \'heard\' of this statistic from someone else.

	Now, what I think the problem is, is the difference between two statements-

Statement 1-
	You only use 10% of your brain\'s potential.
Statement 2-
	10% of your brain is active on the average.

	Statement 1 is, I believe, a misunderstood version of statement 2. Only
part of your brain is active at any one time- signals tend to sweep from
one area to another, as information is processed. HOWEVER, this does NOT
mean that we aren\'t utilizing part of our brain.
	It has also been noted that more \'intelligent\' people often have less
brain activity when solving a problem that less intelligent people. The
theory is that high brain activity indicates a lot of thought.
Intelligent people\'s thoughts are organized in ways that solve problems
better, so it takes less thinking.

The upshot is, there is no good way to expand a human mind. Also, you
CAN\'T treat the mind as a computer bank. Computers and brains operate in
very different ways. (Yes, there ARE similarities, but people seem to be
taking huge liberties with information theory!)

The Recent "Mind Loads" Thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From a purely role-playing and story-telling angle, the limitation that a Psi
loose intelligence, skills, knowledge, or personality in a mind-transfer is so
limiting to the ability that it is extremely unlikely to be used (at least for
this purpose).  This may have been the intent of the original author of the
power.  Personally, I would have this power either (A) work only between
members of the same species, with the newly transferred personality have all of
the intelligence, skills, and personality (perhaps with fragments or tints of
the previous personality), or (B) make it magic, and allow the Psi to transfer
to any mind of any creature, retaining full personality, intelligence, and
mental abilities, or (C) not allow it at all.

In my opinion, the power should be chosen for its story-telling and
question-raising ability, and the rationale worked out from that.  Suspension of
disbelief can be worked on pretty flimsy ground, of the story is interesting.
On the other hand, if the story is dull, even the most well-reasoned mechanics
are not going to help.  So do what you are comfortable with!

You know that you are onto something when the players (all on their own) start
speculating about how the power *MIGHT* work, and are debating the various
philosphical points raised by such a psionic ability.


What Does a Gravitic Field Look Like?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In my Traveller "universe" a Paragravitic Field (or "Grav Field") is the force
field created by a Paragravitic Field Generator ("Grav Generator" for short).
The field is emitted by plate-like emitters ("Grav Plates") connected to the
Grav Generator by some type of waveguide or conduit.

Objects (or people, or whatever) within the field experience forces *EXACTLY*
as if the gravitic forces were being created by a point mass of a specific
size, at a specific location relative to the emitter plates.  This mass is not
really present, it is a "Virtual Mass".  The size, shape, and location of the
plates, as well as the power and control inputs to the generator determine the
aparrent size and position of the "Virtual Mass", as well as the size and shape
of the gravitic field.

With a large enough generator, and enough conduit and emitter plates, the field
can be nearly any imaginable shape and size.  Within the field, everyone and
everything experiences the gravitation of the virtual mass (for example, the
virtual mass might be that of an Earth-sized planet, with an aparrent location
of several thousand miles below the grav plates; the net result being a field
with earth-like gravity.  In this case, the field would probably be flat
pancake, about three meters thick above each grav plate.

Outside of the field, the effects of the virtual mass are not felt at all.  At
the very edge of the field, the effect is undefined, and the usual result is
a region of gravitic turbulence (not usually dangerous, but awfully
disconcerting to pass through).

Grav generators are usually kept running whenever possible.  It takes time for
the field to build up strength.  As energy is input to the grav generator, it
uses that energy to build the strength of the field, thereby increasing the
potential energy of everything inside the field.  When the generator is switched
off, the field strength gradually decreases, as the potential energy is
dissipated by the grav generator.  During normal operation of the grav
generator, it requires some power to maintain the field, and additional power as
the energy of objects inside the field changes.

Special cases (such as when two fields overlap) are usually left to the
referee.  Fields normally overlap and simply add effects; although in special
cases (such as when an experienced grav technician made a skill roll) fields
have been created to cancel out or interfere with other ones.  Some sensors
(the densitometer, to be specific) have the ability to detect grav fields.
Other, more specialized diagnostic equipment can be used by a grav technician
to map out a grav field and determine its characteristics.

To fit this explanation in with the philosophy above: My intent was to have a
gravitic device that was conceptually simple (it creates a virtual mass at a
certain aparrent distance) so that anyone could get a workable handle on the
"how it works", and I wanted something that would not grossly violate
conservation of energy (since there are typically a number of scientists or
engineers in any Traveller crowd).  The numbers presented for grav equipment in
the various Traveller and MegaTraveller books are then treated as
approximations.

Richard asks:  What does a grav field "Look" like?

Well, I assume you are using a densiometer to "look" at it.  Or some
other means to measure gravitic potential.  (How else would you "see"
it?)

Well, the model I have looked at grav plates as though they are some kind
of resonant effect within the hull of the ship.  Thus, you have grav plates
on the \'floor\' and \'ceiling\' of your ship, which makes the entire hull
into some sort of resonant cavity where the plates interact with each other
in creating your grav field.  I would GUESS that *however* anti-grav works,
this would be the most efficient way to place the plates.  (Sort of a
gravitic laser cavity without a beam?)  You see this way you don\'t have to
waste energy creating a field outside and \'above\' the hull, as the grav
effect is confined to inside it.

What does it "LOOK" like?
Well, inside the ship, Traveller literature seems to indicate that there is
no difference between the effect of grav plates and standing on a planet\'s
surface.  So, to my mind someone with a densiometer would detect things on
the ship normally.
	Now, we are told that it is difficult or impossible to

That abou matches what I wrote, and I like it.  Presumably grav drives
for air/rafts and the like use an unconfined grav field, and are
therefore less efficient and have a "fringe" effect due to the drive.

I will further more stick my neck out and conjecture that "thruster
plates" for reactionless drives in spacecraft use a tuned cavity to
create a coherent "beam".  The propulsion is more efficient, and doesn\'t
need an external grav field to "push against"; it "pushes" against
itself.

Except that we have been told that an unshielded densitometer doesn\'t
work in a grav field (first introduced in _Grand_Survey_, I believe).
If an unshielded densitometer is inside a grav field, or is scanning at
or through an area containing a grav field, the only reading you get is
"artificial grav field".

Shielded densitometers are available; they are considerably larger, more
expensive, and more power-hungry than the unshielded versions (the
shielded versions are the ones listed in the _Referee\'s_Handbook_).
These work from within a grav field, but still cannot "see" into or
through one.

Presumably the MegaTraveller densitometers use sensitive artificial grav
fields to do their scanning; an external grav field would completely
swamp the signal, and you get no information.

How about this: Grav fields are opaque to densitometers, with one
exception - the grav field surrounding a grav-sheilded densitometer is
transparent to that densitometer.

Coherent grav fields would have sharp edges and would be very well
defined.  Presumably, a good operator could tell the difference between
different types of coherent grav fields ("That one\'s a thruster plate;
that one\'s the deck gravity, and there\'s a repulsor bay in operation").

Non-coherent grav fields (like those produced by many small gravitic
devices, air/rafts, and other goodies) would be more nebulous and
fuzzy-looking.  Their edges would probably be transparent to some
degree, with the insides being opaque.

That might be possible; each different kind of grav generator might have
a different "signature" - if you could learn what it was, and subtract
it out, you might be able to scan into or through grav fields to a
limited degree.  If it were easy, cheap, or reliable, someone would have
done it a long time ago.  This is therefore a place where the referee
and the player characters can have some fun; lots of money, research,
time, and good skill rolls, and they might have something that they can
use against that pesky corsair captain.  Or even better yet, have an NPC
scientist who has "almost" solved the problem, and get the player
characters mixed up in the affair (after all, who *WOULDN\'T* want to be
able to seen through grav fields with a densitometer).

I think the actual quote is 35%, but I get your general idea.  I "heard" it
from Albert Einstein (in a quote by him, but I forget the source).  It is not
a fact, merely a theory, but I\'d say that it is based on some observations
such as neural activity, etc.

Considering that the brain is a dynamic thinking tool, then if only 10% of
it is used on average, then there is the potential that all of it can be used,
though current knowledge does not know a method of using more of the brain
that is used by natural thinking.

Personally, I don\'t know how they could have approximated what 100%
brain usage would be.  Perhaps their 35% is actual 100%, and persons
displaying more than that have highly active neural patterns.

Perhaps interfaces would be a good start.  Dedicated neural storage expansions
that have a human though interface, so that the human host recognises it as
another part of the brain.  One downside of this, is that overuse would
end up in the brain "becoming lazy" and spreading it\'s workload out uniformly,
so that if the interface is removed, there could be withdrawal symptoms or
worse.  If the brain decides that the best place to put it\'s life support
processes/workload/whatever is the expansion memory, then look out when it
is removed.

another idea would be a maths processor interface, this would react to
a function like input from the mind directly, and would return the correct
solution in milliseconds.  The only problem is that optimum use can only
be had by a person familiar with matematics to start with.  But education
of the future will probably focus on maths anyway...  who knows?

Regards,

	Mike.

Power plants produce neutrinos.  Neutrinos go through just about anything,
except neutrino sensors.  (How _they_ work is a subject for another
discussion. :-)  So a ship with a decent neutrino sensor will find those
power plants without needing spies.

Note that one of the factors which determines how hard it is to hit a target
is the target\'s agility.  What is the agility of the attacking ship?  What
is the agility of the ground-based power plant?  Which one is going to get
hit first?

Surely the fleet which is doing the dropping has the same problem as the
fleet looking for power plants, i.e. the planet is firing back?  The main
problem with dropping nukes is that the planet probably also has a good
supply of nuclear dampers.

Note that the attacking ships also have meson screens.  And that power plant
is going to show up on the attacker\'s sensors rather nicely.  Also note that
meson screens are not impenetrable.  Finally, guess what happens to anything
in the vicinity of that power plant if it is the anti-matter type and it
takes a direct hit from anything.

But the fleet can evade, i.e. it has Agility, which counts against the planet\'s
attacks.  The planet, on the other hand, is a sitting target.

Looting, slavery, grabbing the land.  Or bring a few portable power supplies,
alias battleships, and let them keep the place running until the planet\'s own
power supplies are repaired or replaced.  (That should be a nice deterrent to
the planet\'s guns, by the way - "Sorry, you\'ve just destroyed the ships which
would have saved your society. :-)

It appears I have solved some of the critical problems plaguing this
list, with much help from Mark Cook and much support, encouragement, and
question-answering from metlay, Bryan Borich, and many others.

What I\'ve done:

    Mark helped me restart the biweekly and bundle subscribers.

    Mark fixed the "End of Biweekly" message that was being erroneously
    appended to the NIGHTLY digest.

    Mark helped edit a few new addresses in.

    I just updated the distribution lists for the first time since late
    July, removing lots of people who wanted off the TML, and adding
    several newcomers (you know who you are, introduce yourselves, why
    don\'t you?!).

    I beat several pages of mail requests into submission.

What I haven\'t done yet:

    Gotten Striker his disks (still).

    Gotten quick answers back to those who mailed me specific questions
    like "I\'m missing articles XXX through YYY, can you remail them to
    me?" or "Help me find file XXX on sunbane". Hang tight, I\'ll get
    back to you.

Thanks all of you who helped or lent encouragement. BTW, my wife Glennis
is now the proud owner of an Opal Green Honda Civic LX 4-door Automatic,
and the attendant painful monthly obligation. So -- she\'s planning to
look for work this year rather than playing student.

I think TML sanity is (almost) at hand.

Hi all !

Since everyone is interested in bio systems etc, I\'d like to ask a question
thats been bugging me and I haven\'t yet had a chance to look up anything.

Essentially, with Traveller we assume there haven\'t been any evolutionary
changes in humans. Given current genetic engineering developments, would
there be human variants in the Traveller universe ?  So what is the state
of genetic engineering in the Traveller universe ? Was there some catastrophic
event that banned such development or was it placed in the too hard basket
given the ethical and moral dilemmas ?

So if Darwinian evolution is less applicable to humans, is it up to ourselves
to evolve as we need ? What is current evolutionary theory and how do humans
develop any further ? Any ideas ?

A minor note, travelling to all these worlds is fun but what about the disease
and germ problems involved ?

Note that I played and used Traveller rules, not Mega Traveller.

Hello all.

Having just experienced Hurricane Andrew, I was wondering if anyone had come
up with rules for weather prediction.  Also, how would one determine damage
to grounded ships if a big storm hit while they were dirtside?

A rather difficult proposition as a target.  Ok, she can\'t maneuver

Evolution by genetic engineering: probably possible.  Whether it would be
desirable to create some form of super-race, and what the rest of humanity
would do to it, is another question.  See oblique references in Star Trek II
(Eugenics Wars), some of Larry Niven\'s and Jerry Pournelle\'s work (Saurian
supermen), and what everyone thought of the Aryan master race.

Evolution by natural means: I don\'t think this would happen, especially in
the time scale involved here.  Doesn\'t evolution tend to take rather a long
time, more than just a couple of thousand years, in advanced life forms?
Besides, natural selection is being overridden by society\'s tendency to care
for its weaker members - there is no natural selection, for example, to help
humans evolve into a species which does not get AIDS.

I\'d be inclined to say that storms of that magnitude are acts of GM, and as
such don\'t need rules.  If you want a storm that cripples the PC\'s ship,
just have one.  You can, of course, have a world on which such storms are
common, and let the weather expert PC figure out how such a world can
exist while the social science PC can tell everyone why anyone settled on
it in the first place.

And if you build something similar with its own internal power plant and
manoeuvre drives, you get the same capability plus the ability to act as
an SDB, mainly because what you have is an SDB.

An SDB could switch off its drives and do the same thing.

So the attacking ships go underwater as well and play "Hunt for Red
October".

As a matter of interest, could one of the physics experts tell us how big
a geothermal plant would have to be in order to provide enough power to
drive a meson gun?

    'body' => 'On the subject of Genetic Engineering in Traveller:

o Genetic Engineering in Classic Trav - in order to perform Genetic Engineering
  (not just directed breeding) on a species, it is necessary to understand the
  science of genetics.  The Vilani, for example, had several faulty theries of
  Biolgy prior to their contact with Terrans, because they were genetically very
  different than the other animals of Vland.  The same goes for the Vargr and
  the Zhodani.  The K\'Kree, the Hivers, the Aslan, and the Solomani are the only
  \'Major\' races who evolved on their planet of origin, and therefore, the only
  \'Major\' races likely to be know a lot about genetics.

  To summarize:
  The Solomani could know quite a bit about genetics, and make use of it.
  The Aslan might find genetic alteration of the species without honour and
     avoid such studies.
  The K\'Kree view themsevles as the pinnacle of creation, and would see no
     need for genetic engineering.
  The Hiver are more interested in the engineering of societies than
     individuals, but I could see them dabbling in genetic engineering.
  The Zhodani are more interested in the development of the mind than the body.
  The Vargr are a genetically engineered race, and might view further genetic
     engineering with some suspiscion, and question its usefulness for gaining
     plunder.
  The Vilani might disdain the science of genetics as a \'Terran conconction\',
     and not vigorously pursue the study of it.

  It is important to note that the single instance I can recall from Classic
  Trav mentioning Genetic Engineering in the current era, was a race of sophont
  Dolphins, genetically altered by the Solomain from Terran Dolphins.

o Genetic Engineering in MegaTraveller.  All comments made above still hold.
  However, in the Solomani & Aslan module by DGP, several references are made
  to the fact that the Solomani are well known for their abilities as genetic
  engineers.  Also, in the MegaTraveller Journal (I forget the issue number),
  a race of humans genetically engineered in the year 800 is mentioned.

  A new summary:
  The Solomani are known as genetic engineers.  However, their racial views
     have caused them to perform less such work than in the past. because of
     the confusion over \'What is a Solomani?\'
  Same comment for the Aslan as before.
  Same comment for the K\'Kree as before.
  Same comment for the Hivers as before.
  Same comment for the Zhodani as before.
  Same comment for the Vargr as before.
  The Vilani discourage innovation and change, preferring the traditional ways
     of doing things.  Genetic engineering would be contrary to their lifestyle.

o In conclusion, it can be argued that the Solomani are the only Major race with
  a marked tendency to genetically engineer their species.  This does not
  preclude the possibility of one or more minor races with such a tendency.

        As an engineer  who role plays in Traveller, I\'ve  leaned
toward  the  "technical"  aspects  of  MT.   GDW  might  consider
technically  detailed supplements to TNE about  lanthanum  grids,
etc. in adventure terms for us "teckies".

        As for integrating the "stutterwarp" into TNE from the MT
world,  the  "it  was  there all along"  argument  is  bogus  and
disappointing  to  us  converting  over.   It  rather  should  be
considered a different approach to the basic jump drive  concept.
Using  the  "Crazy Eddie" idea from of MOTE IN GOD\'S  EYE  as  an
example:   being  a civilization of TL"n"  does  not  necessarily
imply  that you\'ve thought of and tried everything possible  with
all technologies at your disposal.

        Historically  in  game terms, the  stutterwarp  could  be
treated  as a new or radically different idea that was missed  or
never explored for a variety of reasons during the development of
the  jump drive.  Or, reversing the roles from MOTE, one  way  it
might  be introduced is as some "alien" development,  simple  yet
never  conceived by humans.  (Not Hiver - they wouldn\'t allow  it
out  of their control and it should be available to  all  playing
the game, not just their favorite Vyks).

        It doesn\'t have to be tech-level based in the sense  that
only TLG+ societies have it.  For game balance reasons, it should
be  so simple of a concept that any society capable of  producing
jump  drives should also be able to produce stutterwarp  provided
they have heard enough details of the concept.

Ok, that\'s better.

Now about this virus...

Does anybody here remember one of my designs last year?  The Vulture
Class orbital repair bot?  I had designed a robot which would move
around a planets orbit, deorbiting junk and generally cleaning up the
place to keep things from smashing up expensive spacecraft.

Well, I wrote a little story about it to go along with the design.
It seems that a pack of these little bots were being used to clean
up The Battle of Two Suns.  They came across the wreck of a Kinunir
class cruiser and reactivated it\'s computer.  The (slightly paranoid)
Artificial Intelligence program took control of the robots.  The ship
then used the robots to repair itself to a jumpable condition.

The ship then began spreading virus programs that went out taking
control of other Vulture repair bots.  These bots began cacheing
spares and equipment for the continuing repair of the cruiser.  They
also began building up a small fleet of ships which had been damaged
and had been convertied over to control by the AI software.

Contrast this with the \'Vampire\' ships GDW suddenly \'came up with\'.
*MY* fleet had a source of repair parts and the Muscles to repair
themselves!  Theirs will malfunction when they miss their annual
maintainance!

Now, I\'m *REAL* *SURE* GDW came up with this one on their own.
Yeah!  Right!  And Nobody ever saw George\'s stuff on watercraft
design either!  And Everybody at GDW just *FORGOT* that Rob Dean
did virtually *ALL* the ship designs for *TWO* recent releases.

You know an interesting thing about that Vulture Bot...  I wrote it
up at a time when Rob Dean was communicating with Chuck Gannon.  Rob
was telling me that he wanted to send Chuck copies of the designs he
and I have done.  So, since he sounded interested, and Rob had sent
me his address, I sent Chuck a copy of the Vulture bot and the story.

I never got so much as a reply.

So I figgered he wasn\'t interested.  |-P

*AHEM!*
Now, I\'m not accuseing anybody of anything *YET*.
But Fukkit!  Something is *GODDAM* *FUCKING* *SUSPICIOUS* around here!

What is GDW gonna do *NEXT?*  Write up an adventure about some Zhodani
before the Fifth Frontier WAR?

A *VERY* angry,

Scott 2G Kellogg
Oh great!  They\'re gonna redo the vehicle design system
******************A G A I N??**************************

Disclaimer: I\'m *CERTAIN* Rob Dean had nothing to do with any of this,
he got screwed by GDW at about the same time.  I *KNOW* Rob wouldn\'t
be a party to any wrongdoing here.  And if he had *any* involvement in
it, it was purely accidental.  So, Rob, please forgive my putting your
name in here.

First of all, the idea of virus is nothing new, I\'m sure your story
wasn\'t the first one which use the idea. For the past several years,
computer virus has been getting lots of publicity, just because
you send them a story which has virus as an important concept, and
they have this organic chip id system which works like a virus
hardly implies they stole the idea from you.

And as far as Rob\'s design wasn\'t ackknowledged in the magazine
article, my understanding was that it was a typesetting mistake.
They simply omited it by accident.

From the sounds of it it looks like here is another RPG that will go the way
of Space 1889. GDW now has over half dozen rpgs on market, it is clearly
unable to effectively support what it has, so they\'ll deep six their
"award winning design" and bring out another kludge that no one likes and
that they cannot support. Maybe they should change their name to Game
Rules Generators. They are also going to start a new magazine?? This after
their own admission that they cannot get enough stuff to fill Challenge.
I find it somewhat amusing that they have so much stuff on the market
simultaneously yet over half of their magazine is filled with stuff related
to games from other companies....
Oh well....I guess I should take the plunge and just start typing in a
comprehensive rules for playing Traveller as it used to be.

     GenCon/Origins \'92 is over, and there\'s a lot of news.  The GDW
staff conducted 2 seminars for the public, then a full day\'s Traveller
Writers\' Conference at Bloomington, Illinois the day after the con.
     The seminars were well attended with a significant proportion of
the audience from outside the States.  I wish I was able to meet some
of these new faces, but couldn\'t do everything. However, I did finally
meet in the flesh Roger Myhre (Norway, HIWG) and Bertil Jonell
(Sweden).
     The Writers\' Conference was conducted by David Nilsen, Steve
Maggi, Loren Wiseman, and Frank Chadwick.  The outside writers around
the table were Bertil Jonell, Mike Mikesh (HIWG), Greg Videll (HIWG),
Harold Hale, Rob Prior (HIWG), Terry McInnes (HIWG), Scott Olson
(HIWG), and Clay Bush (HIWG).  What follows is a fusion of information
collected from both the Conference and seminars.  (Many thanks to
Terry McInnes for having arranged the conference.)

TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA -- WHY?
     GDW admits they did not support MEGATRAVELLER (MT) adequately.
An underlying reason was simply that they did not play MT, and so did
not know the system very well.  As a result, temptation was too great
to redirect support elsewhere.  GDW wasn\'t offering this reason as an
excuse, only as an explanation.
     To avoid this problem, they want to write TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA
(TNE) strictly in-house.  Further, it will be based on the
TWILIGHT:2000 family of games, which is good for a few reasons.
     First off, TNE will belong to the GDW house role playing system.
Because of this, the designers don\'t have to think in terms of a
different rules set when they provide TRAVELLER support, giving them a
boost in productivity.
     Second, its very easy for gaming groups to hop among GDW RP games
and even borrow elements from one another.
     Third, the house role playing system is a direct descendant of
classic TRAVELLER.  TRAVELLER was their first RP game, but never
received the benefits of GDW\'s advances in RP game system design.  Now
they finally have a chance to do so.  TRAVELLER is coming home.
     Contrary to what some might believe, this is not a move just to
make more money with a new rules set.  While it is true that new rules
sell well, the initial sales of TNE will pay for itself and that\'s
all.  It takes a lot of effort and resources to put out a rules set.
Profit comes as a result of reorders, so for TNE to be profitable, it
must be good and its appeal must grow.
     The changes taking place in the Imperium setting are in effort to
create more wild frontiers.  Originally, the Imperium was a very
stable place, and well known to characters through the usual networks
of library data.  The Rebellion shattered that stability.
Unfortunately, the Rebellion itself became a spectator sport, too
large in scope for player characters to interact with.
     The background for TNE is set 70 years after the Rebellion (circa
1190) in a time when interstellar society has completely collapsed.
(The GDW staff members whimsically called this intervening period, the
Short Nap.)  This is a time, three generations later, when there are
very few people left who remember the old Imperium.  Records from the
Third Imperium are often lost (as a result of the Virus; see later).
And, many worlds have died or diverged dramatically following the
collapse of interstellar commerce.
     This element of the background was deliberate so that players do
not have to be familiar with the Imperium setting.  There is a lot to
know, which is probably a large part of TRAVELLER\'s appeal to many
HIWGers.  But GDW cannot afford to let TRAVELLER become a game for
elite and dedicated players.  New players are intimidated by the
volume of information that exists, which is impeding TRAVELLER\'s
growth.  So, TNE will render most of that information unknown and
unnecessary without invalidating the previous literature.
     Established players will undoubtedly look back at classic
TRAVELLER with a sense of nostalgia, which will have an intrinsic
benefit in gaming with new comers.  Long time players running
characters who skipped the "Short Nap" in cold sleep will remember
well "the good ol\' days."  They can relay their knowledge through role
playing, but also sincerely convey an appreciation for what was lost.
Perhaps together, old and new characters can restore the glory that
belonged to that part of space.

RULES SYSTEM
     TNE will come as two books.  The first will have only the rules.
The second will contain the Imperium background.  The aim is to give
players the option to adopt other science fiction universes for their
campaigns.  GDW is even seriously considering a 2300 AD Sourcebook,
restoring support for 2300 AD as a subset of TRAVELLER.
     The TNE rules will use DARK CONSPIRACY as a starting point since
that is the latest iteration of the house rules.  It will also adopt
the D20 task system from the DARK CONSPIRACY PC BOOSTER KIT and
difficulty levels that originally came from 2300 AD.  This system will
allow characters to apply more than one skill if the situation calls
for it.  Although the house rules currently do not allow zero-level
skills, Clay Bush\'s comments during the Conference might have shifted
GDW\'s thinking on this.
     TNE will definitely not be an outgrowth of MT.  Although MT was
an award winning game design, the GDW staff isn\'t comfortable
continuing with it because of elements they considered "fussy".  In
particular, GDW will completely revise the ship design system to make
it easier.  Digest Group made a special effort to assure that classic
ships were convertible to MT.  GDW, however, will not do this so as to
not risk compromising the new system.
     Dave Nilsen intends to present the design system in the basic
rules book rather than split it off.  This is not to say that
absolutely everything will be there, since we know from STRIKER, BOOK
8 - ROBOTS, COACC, and WET NAVY, that there is an awful lot.  All the
hooks will be there, though.
     The design system will have differing design sequences for
different vehicles.  The tank system, for instance, will not include
consideration for a jump drive or spinel mount.  However, the combat
system will be compatible with everything.  Tanks can fire on
starships, for instance, without requiring a conversion.
     Three versions of faster-than-light drives will be presented in
the rules, jump drive (TRAVELLER), stutterwarp (2300 AD), and star
gates (resembling Pournelle\'s MOTE IN GOD\'S EYE universe).
     The ship combat system might include a vector combat system, like
what appeared in GDW\'s MAYDAY. However, GDW hopes to simplify bringing
distant ships to tactical range without burdening players with vector
mechanics just to get their ships to close.  A vector combat system
will probably not appear if GDW uses instead the stutterwarp combat
system (see later).
     The world generation system will remain as it is with one minor
exception.  The stars a system will be a factor of the kind of main
world generated.  Its too difficult rationalizing the large number of
hospitable worlds circling stars of types unlikely to have anything
but dead planets.  So, most of the star types in the sector data lists
will change (where stellar data exists at all).
     Doing this, however, will skew the stellar population
unnaturally.  Most real stars are red dwarfs, whereas they will be
uncommon in TRAVELLER. However, a misconception crept into star charts
that GDW might decide to throw back out.  Charts were only meant as
navigation aids.  They originally did not represent the actual
positions of the star systems nor all of the star systems present.
They showed only systems that might be visited, particularly ones with
populations or sources of fuel.  Other systems did not show.
     By this rationale, star charts from the First Imperium could
differ surprisingly from those of the Third.  Some worlds might have
been populated by the Vilani that are dead and useless now, and so do
not appear.  The converse could also be true.

NEW ERA BACKGROUND
     There won\'t be much left of interstellar society after the Virus
causes the total collapse interstellar trade.  This destroys the
Solomani Confederation and most of the alien realms as well.  We\'re
left with what is spinward of the Rift, a remnant of Lucan\'s Imperium
in Core Sector, and scattered pocket empires.
     Seventy years after the Rebellion, struggling pocket empires will
be far and few between.  The Long Night was supposed to be desolate,
but too many exceptions, such as Ral Ranta in the Hinterworlds, were
written back in.  GDW plans to be very restrained in the number and
size of pocket empires that exist by this time.
     The New Era will be an age of discovery. Explorers (Star Vikings)
from the pocket empires will go out and recontact worlds in a fashion
loosely resembling what we see in STAR TREK.  Starships are still
especially rare and valuable during this time.  Boarding action will
prevail in space combat so as to capture, not destroy, the hardware.
     Deneb survives, thanks in part to an impassioned appeal by Chuck
Kallenbach (Paranoia Press; HIWG).  Vargr activity across the Corridor
slowed the migration of the Virus long enough to give Norris time to
prepare and counter it.  As a result, the Empire of Deneb remains a
powerful interstellar state even in the New Era.
     TNE will detail the Zhodani.  A modus vivendi exists between
Deneb and the Consulate whereby the governments are at peace with one
another, even if the cultures are at odds. Some trade does take place,
but Deneb will more vigorously pursue trade with the Human Client
States to replace old Imperial markets.  However, an understanding
exists with the Zhodani that Deneb will not absorb those states.
     Conflict still exists with the Vargr and Aslan.  Ultimately,
Deneb might wage a campaign against the Vargr in Corridor and push
back through the Rift.

THE VIRUS IS YOUR FRIEND
     There is much to say about the Virus, but I will gloss over most
of the details and leave them to CHALLENGE 64.  Keep in mind that the
Virus is only a device that gets us to the New Era. The New Era is set
in stone, and refinements to the Virus and history must give us that
result.
     The silicon lifeforms of Cymbeline (see ADVENTURE 13 - SIGNAL GK)
are, in effect, sophont computer chips.  All starships that trade in
Imperial space (including aliens) have transponders with sophont chips
whose circuits are based on these.  When ships encounter one another,
the transponders interrogate one another until each is convinced of
the other\'s identity.  Starship crews might think a complex system of
codes is involved, when in fact the chips are just having a binary
chat session to compare notes.
     Among the \'secret weapons\' developed under Lucan were
transponders based on the Cymbeline predator chip.  Through radio
contact, they could reprogram transponder chips into other predators,
which in turn could similarly affect system computers.
     Engineers in Lucan\'s labs were trying to design these predators
so that no generation would ever harm systems loyal to Lucan\'s
Imperium, but they could never perfect that. Frustrated, Lucan ordered
it released anyway.  The Ilelish Federation also released it,
inadvertently, after an espionage team acquired a copy of it.
     The most insidious aspect of the Virus is its intelligence.
Contemporary computer viruses passively spread as copies attached to
other programs.  The TNE Virus, however, can actively find ways to
open data links and write intelligent viruses onto other operating
systems.  They can be aware of the real world and manipulate the real
world to suit their own ends.
     Most Viruses are dormant, keeping themselves concealed and
generating new Viruses.  But when they turn malignant, the effect is
similar to what was depicted in MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.  Machines that can
be controlled from computers begin murdering people.
     One of the results of this are \'vampire ships\' where the computer
has killed its own crew, as in ADVENTURE 1 - KINUNIR or the HAL 9000
in 2001.  These ships will continue as best they can to spread the
Virus or inflict the greatest possible harm.  Some might even take
human hostages to serve their needs.
     Not all Viruses are the same.  Each generation is a mutation of
the previous one, so each Virus will be unique with a different
personality, agenda, and interpretation of its goals.  This grants
referees the liberty to decide what the Viruses might do.  One might
just kill at every opportunity.  Another might create a pseudo-real
human personality in communication to lure unsuspecting ships to their
doom.  Another might recruit other vampire ships to form a vampire
fleet.  Its even possible for a Virus to evolve that is benevolent,
although will likely be unstable.
     As you can see, the Virus offers an endless number of exciting
science fiction plots.

STAR VIKINGS
     The Virus inflicted much harm upon the Hive Federation.  However,
thanks to their advanced knowledge in electronics, they combated it
more effectively and preserve their interstellar society.
     Curious about what happened to the humans, they found the
Solomani Confederation and factions of the Imperium completely
dissolved.  Worlds were beginning to recover, though.  Humans would
inevitably resume interstellar commerce and not suffer a prolonged
Long Night.
     But what would these new human societies be like?  Many of the
worlds in Diaspora Sector, for instance, were xenophobic
technocracies, their attitudes having been shaped by the Rebellion and
Hard Times.  The interstellar societies that evolve from those might
well be narrow minded, war-like, and generally very bad neighbors.
     Hiver traders tried to encourage more benign attitudes through
their contacts with the humans, but were largely UNSUCCESSFUL.  Many
of their traders were even attacked and destroyed, so the Hivers
shifted tactics.
     In contacts with the few human societies receptive to the Hivers,
they were able to encourage those people to begin exploration and
trade.  The Hivers provided the technology, along with Hiver technical
advisors (ostensibly to maintain the equipment, but probably to assure
their plans remained on course).  The human traders went forth well
armed, not only for their protection, but to force neighboring worlds
into trade agreements for their own good.
     These trade explorers are the Star Vikings.  They are not
monolithic since they come from different worlds and states scattered
among Diaspora, Old Expanses, Solomani Rim, and areas formerly loyal
to Margaret.  Their activities parallel in ways those of the Spanish
maritime explorers of the 1500\'s and 1600\'s.  Traders from each state
have their own objectives, and may even be in competition with one
another.  But all are backed or influenced by the Hivers to some
degree.
     Frank Chadwick likened the Star Vikings to the Elizabethan Sea
Hawks.  Dave Nilsen described them as a "Hanseatic League with teeth."
I\'m not a student of history, so I don\'t know what these are.
However, from WEBSTER\'S DICTIONARY OF PROPER NAMES,

          Hanseatic League  A 13th-century association of
          North German cities which once monopolized Baltic
          trade, but lost influence in the 17th century;
          leading members were Lubeck, Hamburg and Bremen.

     Frank Chadwick mentioned three basic types of Star Viking
adventure missions:  invasion, smash & grab (or just smash), and
decapitation.  He didn\'t go into details of what these are, but smash
and decapitation sound to me like missions to cripple the advancement
of opposing factions.
     The \'long ship\' is a class of starship apparently unique to the
Star Vikings.  This is an unstreamlined ship with a good jump range,
but minimal or possibly no maneuver drive.  It carries rider ships
which are actually used to contact worlds.

TNE PHILOSOPHIES
     Although the rules system will change, nothing will be lost to
TRAVELLER as a result.  As Dave Nilsen explained, "If you can do it in
TRAVELLER, you can do it in TNE."
     TRAVELLER is not a dark future game and TNE will not be either.
Dave was very clear about his distaste for "wallowing" in decay and
ruin, so TRAVELLER will keep its space opera cum hard science fiction
feel.  TNE will focus on exploration and expansion, looking toward a
positive future and not a negative one.  Even though TNE will include
things like cybernetic body parts, these will not be presented in a
way to suggest a cyberpunk genre.
     GDW will return to being vague about technology.  From the
feedback they received, STARSHIP OPERATOR\'S MANUAL explained too much,
so things like the lanthanum grid for jump drives will not be carried
over.
     TNE will have its mysteries, but many of these will have no
official resolution so as to sustain the mystery.  In some opinions,
classic TRAVELLER made a mistake in saying the Droyne were the
Ancients, and even revealed the Secret of the Ancients.  As a result,
most of their wonder was lost.  In fact, Jeff Grubb adopted this very
philosophy, in designing SPELLJAMMER, because of his disappointment
about revealing too much about TRAVELLER\'s Ancients.
     (While I agree with this philosophy, I strongly disagree that
wonder in the Ancients is destroyed.  Only the tip of the iceberg was
revealed, and a whole spectrum of things can be done involving them if
handled well.)
     The enormous amount of errata for MT was mentioned twice during
the seminars.  The GDW panel assured the audience that there will
inevitably be some errata, but it will not happen again in the same
volume.  This is another reason why they are doing TNE with the house
rules.  With the staff having better control and understanding of the
game, errors will be no more common than we\'ve seen with their other
games, and probably less for their sensitivity about this.

STUTTERWARP & TRAVELLER
     GDW is seriously considering including TWO faster-than-light star
drives in the Imperial setting, traditional jump drive and stutterwarp
from 2300 AD.  Frank Chadwick and Lester Smith favor this because
stutterwarp makes for a very interesting space combat system.
     This will be the only real discontinuity between MT and TNE that
GDW will consider.  If used, TNE will assume that stutterwarp existed
and was actively employed through all the Imperiums despite lack of
mention in MT and classic TRAVELLER.
     The GDW panel took a voice census during the seminar to get a
feel for public reaction.  There was strong support for both sides.
GDW is still undecided at this time, so it might be worthwhile for
people to send their opinions to Dave Nilsen, the TRAVELLER line
manager at GDW.

PRODUCTS
     Release of TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA is postponed to February 1993.
They do not want to risk a rushed job on this.
     The next TRAVELLER product we\'ll see is the folio adventure,
ARRIVAL VENGEANCE, by Greg Videll.  The characters are aboard a
LIGHTNING class cruiser that crosses the Rift to learn what happened
to Gushemege Sector and the rest of the former Imperium.  This will
conclude MEGATRAVELLER.
     As TNE comes out, GDW will also release the folio, SURVIVAL
MARGIN.  This will not be an adventure, but a guide to MEGATRAVELLER
players in converting to TNE.  Campaigns that want to continue their
existing characters might just use cold sleep to bring them forward
(see DIGEST #21, "Suspended Animation").  Alternatively, players might
run descendants of their former characters, perhaps retaining certain
characteristics or possibly an inheritance from their PC ancestors.
     James Maliszewski (HIWG) is writing the first TNE folio
adventure, originally scheduled for March 1993 with a sequel in
October 1993.  Beginning probably with issue 70, CHALLENGE will
contain official TNE adventures each month.  These will probably
relate to the folios.
     Dave Nilsen is considering another folio tentatively called
VAMPIRE SHIP, which will essentially be a dungeon crawl through a ship
infected by a Virus.
     Because there will be very few TNE characters originating from
space careers, many will come from the flyer or sailor professions.
GDW will probably release an Air & Sea supplement, and (to no one\'s
surprise) Terry McInnes will most likely be its author.
     Campaign sourcebooks for different periods of Imperial history
(First Imperium was specifically mentioned) are possible, and
especially a 2300 AD SOURCEBOOK as mentioned earlier.  These, however,
will not likely come out in TNE\'s first year.
     STAR VIKING, the game, has been shelved indefinitely.  Before its
demise, two games were envisioned.  The first, STAR VIKING -
PLANETFALL, was to be a ground based game.  Whether this would have
been a boardgame or miniatures changed a couple of times.  The second,
STAR VIKING - THE LONG SHIPS, was to be a strategic level game across
interstellar space.
     Dave Nilsen really, really wants to do miniatures rules at some
point, so GDW might do STRIKER II.  That\'s still a ways down the road.
However, there is a chance that official TNE miniatures might come out
soon after the game\'s release.  Even though there will be no miniature
rules as such, the GDW house rules system still works very well with
miniatures.

WRITERS
     Although GDW is writing TNE in-house, they still need outside
writers, particular for CHALLENGE.  The CHALLENGE adventures will help
give players a feel for the new game.  A little more room is available
in CHALLENGE, thanks to GDW\'s new magazine.  JOURNEYS, as its called,
will support multigenre games and pull over some things that occupied
space in CHALLENGE.
     GDW will accept blurbs for "Travellers News Service" (TNS).  As
always, blurbs are anonymous -- no author credit will appear.  These
are especially welcome if they tie in with an adventure article
submitted to CHALLENGE.  Such blurbs should point the way and serve as
a lead-in to the adventure.  They should never spell out the results
of the adventure.  That would fix the outcome and invalidate player
character efforts to influence events.
     There will also be opportunities for writers to do more TNE
folios in the future.  Folios run from 12-16,000 words and are
typically targetted for 12,500 words.

ODDS AND ENDS
     For quite some time, Digest Group Publications (DGP) had plans
for a major invasion of the Zhodani Consulate by aliens from coreward.
The original plot, often referred to as, "Baddies from the Core," was
first proposed by Terry McInnes, and had since undergone a great deal
of evolution.  A sighting of inexplicably damaged Zhodani ships in TNS
was a hint of this.  (The "Primordials" in KNIGHTFALL might also have
been related.)  However, with the ending of MT, GDW has also voided
this plot line.
     As of the last word that Dave Nilsen received about DGP, they
still plan to publish MEGATRAVELLER JOURNAL #4.  That concluding issue
will have Bill Keith\'s adventure, "Lords of Thunder," involving a
renewed conflict between the Hivers and K\'kree.  Unfortunately, DGP
did not come to GenCon/Origins, so this information is not current.
     Chuck Gannon has apparently returned to his original occupation
of writing for the film industry.  He still has a few articles in the
hopper for CHALLENGE, but no more are expected.

IMPERIAL LINES
     IL#2, the Solomani & Aslan issue, is at GDW. I gave staff members
and other attendants draft copies of IL#2.  Because of the backlog at
GDW, though, we still might not see IL#2 for a while.
     All the articles I\'ve collected for IL#3, the Vilani & Vargr
issue, are in John Meyers\' hands.  However, Steve Maggi is thinking of
combining #3 & #4 into a single issue.  Also, I will have Dave
Nilsen\'s feedback in a few days regarding IL so far.  The results of
that might significantly alter plans.

HIWG
     In a couple of weeks, I plan to get with Ed Edwards over GEnie to
hash out HIWG\'s role in the New Era.  After that, I plan to submit a
"What in the Stars" about this to AABP, and hopefully Ed will also
have a "Chairsophont Letter."
     The most important role I see for HIWG right now is in promoting
communication.  As a head start, I ask that people send either to Clay
Bush or myself information about the TRAVELLER activities you are
currently involved in.  We don\'t necessarily need to know about your
weekly campaign.  But if you are developing a sector with other fans,
or especially if you are writing something for professional
publication, we want to at least include mention of these in Clay\'s
AABP newsletter.
     As a reminder from TS30, TIFFANY STAR and Clay Bush\'s AABP have
changed roles.  Previously, TS went to all members as part of their
membership dues.  Clay sent AABP to people he wanted to communicate
with at his own expense.  Now AABP is HIWG\'s official newsletter.
TIFFANY STAR is just a mass letter I irregularly send out to friends
and correspondents.
     Non-members reading this are invited to join the History of the
Imperium Working Group.  Membership costs $12 (US) and includes 6

I had to re-read the part about the "mass of data impeding new players".
Sorry, I have trouble with that one too. The players need a few
subsectors, maybe a sector to run arround in. Like the Spinward marches,
which were included with the rules. The rest of the data is stuff to be
added as *needed*.

Their new system will accumulate data just as fast, if it survives.

The only *good* idea in there was allowing there to be multiple kinds of
interstellar drive. That\'s reasonable. If there\'s *a* way to go FTL,
it\'s not that unlikely that there will be multiple ways. And it makes
interactions with "aliens" (or even humans with a different drive
technology) far more interesting.

But there\'s no need to "grandfather" it into the rules. It\'d work just
fine if they just claim that it was developed on a world (or worlds)
that Knew that an interstellar drive had existed, but had no idea how it
worked!

Something like Pournelle\'s Alderson drive would be nice too *if* they do
it right. Which means that you can only jump between specified points in
systems. Not all adjacent systems would have a "jump path" (Alderson
tramline) between them. And anybody who knows the technology *knows*
where the jump points are.

Pournelle chose the limits for that drive *very* carefully. It makes
system defense a considerably different matter than in regular
Traveller. The Alderson points are a spot where you can defend against
invasion, instead of having to wait near the mainworld to see where the
attack comes from.

Cultures with different drives are going to be driving each other
*nuts*. Which is a good thing.

GDW\'s original mistake was the map that had the Imperium *surrounded* by
other cultures.. That *killed* several games I know of that were based
on exploration of "the unknown". And made others toss the background out
the window.

Hmmm... maybe there *is* a second good point. Keeping the rules and the
background seperate may help. But I wish we could have the alian
cultures set up withouit requiring definite locations with respect to
the other cultures?

From memory (tried 2300AD once or twice) there were problems with the
range of StutterWarp.  If you tried to go too far you and the ship died
a very nasty death from radiation buildup.  The radiation is built up by
the amount of time spent in StutterWarp but can be bled off at any large
gravity well.

We had a WAR campaign going for a little while and discovered all sorts
of problems in the 2300AD star maps.  Some places you just could not get
to using StutterWarp because the jump distance was too great and the
radiation buildup would get you.  This is in spite of the fact that the
star map showed it as a regular jump route.

StutterWarp is probably a precursor to JUMP drive but JUMP Drive doesn\'t
have the "lethal" penalties of the latter.  Which would you prefer to fly?

Perhaps treat StutterWarp as a TECH 8/9 mode but with no further
advancement possible (dead end which actually changes to a totally new
JUMP technology).

I see no problem having both on a ship.  Use JUMP to go as far as you can
with available JUMP fuel and then kick in the StutterWarp to finish the
journey.  Don\'t forget to bleed off that extra radiation buildup tho.

Maybe at real high tech levels StutterWarp comes into its own again.

The VAMPIRE ships sound an awful lot like BERZERKERs from Fred Sabehagen\'s
books with a loose explanation thrown in to make them "a unique idea".

Hopefully GDW will give credit where its due.

Pournelle\'s Alderson Drive is nice but the star systems in TRAVELLER are
not ALL the star systems in each HEX.  Each HEX represents a large area
and the dominant system is supposed to be the only really useful one there.

There is no guarantee that the PADrive will get you to ANY TRAVELLER system
as currently mapped.  Again, this can be fitted into TNE as a drive
technology but one that got dropped because it wasn\'t as useful as JUMP
drive even though it was better and faster.  Perhaps the IMPERIUM actually
uses the equivalent of PADrive communications networks but it would wander
thru all sorts of uninhabited systems.

Think of all the exploring that can be done in one HEX.

It sounds like the rules will be generic to any space culture but as GM you
discard what you don\'t want.  If you want the IMPERIUM then simply CUT
and PASTE to make it.  If you want MT then simply CUT and PASTE.

The problem as I see it is that the IMPERIUM had inbuilt boundaries which
prevented it from evolving easily into a new game system.  What GDW are
trying to do is revamp the BASICs so that they can expand the system into
other markets.  It\'s only us players with experience and knowledge of
what the early IMPERIUM and MT were like that are going thru culture
shock.

  That is what Dave Nielsen said during one of the seminars too, that the
original GDW idea was that only the interesting (aka, with planets) systems
were on the map and that there were a loads of planetless red dwarfs around.

  Then somehow, this was forgotten when the Scout-book was written and all
the small red dwarfs were placed in the table as possible results again,
leading to all sorts of strange systems with Ag planets that have a medium
temperature of -100C.

  According to my notes, Tim Brown (who really shot Strephon:) had an alternate
\'crack the imperium\' idea using Berzerkeroids that followed the Zhodani Core
Expeditions home, but I will withhold comment on the \'computer virus makes
ships behave like berzerkers\' idea at least until I have gotten reply on some

  Twice: Once in the article and once in \'Assignment: Vigilante\'.

  When I met Loren at Gencon, he made a question regarding if the ship name
\'Admiral Bertil\' and my name implied that I knew the person who did the
ship, but the name he mentioned wasn\'t Rob Dean!

Subject: (2684) Vulture type TugBots (long)

Hi,

A while ago, people were talking about the possibilities of using
robots as starship crew.  That combined with a CNN science bit got
me thinking...

General Products Vulture Tugbot

     Many planets, especially those with early space travel
techniques have a problem with orbital debris causing collision
hazards in and around desirable orbits.  These range from spent
boosters to paint chips to disabled starships.  The Vulture Tugbot
is an orbital robotic garbage collector.
     Manufactured at TL12, the robot is often seen in use by worlds
of much lower tech.  It costs little compared to many low tech
ships and so can easily fit into a low tech starport\'s budget.  It
is easily capable of boosting satillites up to a stable planetary
orbit.  Traders frown on having to bring their precious ships into
a polluted orbit, so it is good for commerce.
     It has a large cargo capacity for junk and salvageable
materials.  When the unit has collected sufficient refuse or found
a particularly large piece of junk, it will perform a deorbital
maneuver, dump it\'s load and accelerate back to orbital velocity
allowing the refuse to burn up in the planets atmosphere.
     The unit is self repairing and thus rarely requires
maintainace. It is also capable of expanding itself given suitable
salvage materials. Given time and materials it can add to it\'s
thrust with salvaged grav units, or improve its power source by
wiring in salvaged solar panels.
     In systems with an orbital starport it can be programed to
bring all working or repairable salvage into a docking bay.
     The robot has its own radar and passive EMS systems to track
targets. If it finds a target which is not maneuvering and not
emmitting a transponder or other EM transmissions, it will
rendezvous with the object, determine if it is a functioning piece
of equipment or junk.  The unit is also capable of being controlled
from the ground.
     The brain structure of the Tugbot is very unusual in that
there are three robotic brains funtioning in paralell for purposes
of cross checking. This was required when a tug with a single brain
developed a programming fault and began disassembling starships in
orbit.
     The robot is provided with batteries to allow brain functions
while the solar panels are in shadow.
     The Tugbot is manufactured at many different Tech levels, but
the most common is the model below.  Bear in mind that many robots
have been in operation for years and have self modified themselves.

Within recent years, a virus has worked its way into the software
of the Vultures in and around the Imperium.  It seems that the
virus is carried in the memory of starship computers.  An infected
robot will transmit the virus into the starship CPU where it will
lie dormant until the ship\'s sensors detect another Vulture Tugbot.
The process is then repeated.  Many free Traders have become
carriers of the virus and it does not affect the starship
operation.
     The virus apparantly modifies the Vulture\'s three brains in
ways not clearly understood.  The Scout Service has classified the
matter and offered a bond of up to 1MCr for information leading to
the perpetrators of the virus.

Referees:  The source of the virus is another General Products
design.  When Clearing up the debris of the Battle of Two Suns, a
Vulture unit came across the main computer of the Allamu, a Kinunir
class frontier cruiser.  In testing to see weither or not the
computer was salvageable or not the robot powered up the computer.
Apparantly, while sorting through the computers memory, the
artificial intelligence software of the starship took control of
the vulture.  The computer rearranged the Vulture\'s brain and
endowing it with the starships limited artificial intelligence.
     The Allamu then began taking control of the Vultures that were
working the old battleground.  Using their Naval Architecture
programming, it began rebuilding the cruiser from salvage in the
battlefield including parts from the Ninkur Sagga, another Kinunir
class cruiser.  But the robots had a problem: Insufficient knowlege
of jump technology.  They could strip a valuable grid apart, but
not align one.  The cruiser\'s software was also not up to the task.
     The salvage ship the robots were operating from lost contact
with their robots and ended up having to give them up for lost.
When they jumped back to the main world, they carried a computer
virus with them.
     This first virus was to gather information pertaining to jump
technology and to transmit it back to the cruiser\'s computers.  The
computers obtained this information and reassembled the ships jump
drive.  The ship then jumped to a nearby system to complete
repairs.  (The battlefield having been looted and exhausted of
salvage.)  At this point a second virus was released by the ship\'s
computer.  This would modify the brains of Vulture robots in such
a way that they became more \'intelligent\' by restructuring of the
three lobes of the brain.  An assignment was given to these
Vultures:  no longer would they collect and turn over valuable
salvage, but would squirrel it away so that it could be collected
by the cruiser.
     Variants of the virus have resulted in Vultures reproducing
themselves and variant Vulture designs.  Some of these are capable
of landing on a planet and scrounging/stealing parts.  When the
landers reported back (via X-Boat virus) the presence of other
robots, the Allamu began a campaign of robot theft.
     This is when the crime level and pattern rose to Imperial
attention.  By the efforts of a certain scout roboticist (Hey
Richard dig this) The Scouts have determined the actions of the
virus, but have not found it\'s source.  They suspect espionage, but
are very interested in the artificial intelligence software that
they have found.  They know it to be a variant of the Kinunir class
cruiser\'s software, but do not know its true source.
     The cruiser meanwhile has salvaged/repaired/stolen four
starships, now installed with high model computers and the cruisers
artificial intelligence.  These include a Gazelle class escort, a
fat trader, and two scouts now crewed by robots.  Currently being
repaired are another scout and a Leviathan class merchant.
Recently, the Allamu has been searching for the wreck of the Bard
Enterprise an Azhanti High Lightning class cruiser lost during the
Fourth Frontier War.

I would\'ve loved to be there for however many seconds I lasted until
I was forcibly ejected. Had I been presented with some of the data
given below in piecemeal form, rather than in one letter in the order
given, I think I would have had a stroke or committed murder or both.
I commend those present for having had the patience to let GDW feed
them the whole kishkeh; I wouldn\'t have made it to the end.

However, having had the package spelled out below in detail, and having
had several hours to cogitate, AND having reminded myself of the famous
story of Isaac Asimov\'s trip to see a sneak preview of "2001" when it
came out, I can now post a reply to the information given below. I would
appreciate it greatly if Bryan Borich would be so kind as to post this
where Mike and the HIWG dudes, and the GDW staff, can see it.

- ----

I would like to start off by teaching everyone a little phrase I made
up, that is central to this post: Economics Drives Design (Up To A
Point), or EDDUTAP.  What this means is that as much as I would
LOOOOOVE to jump down GDW\'s collective throat with my biggest set of
hobnailed Purist\'s Boots strapped on, I have only a very limited right
to do so. Consider:

On the one hand, a game company relies to an extent on reorders, which
means relying on the continued interest of its players. This implies that
a conscious decision to cut loose a prior game universe and start fresh
with a system that bears only a cursory resemblance to the old one is a
form of corporate suicide.

On the other hand, like so many other areas of goods-and-services marketing,
the game company relies to an extent on generating fresh interest in its
products, by issuing newer versions and (hopefully) better rules systems.
A company that remains hidebound in an old system is committing a form of
corporate suicide.

So whom do we believe? Well, from MY perspective as a long-time end user
AND a writer of material for these games, I know damn well which way a
smart company leans, if it wants to stay alive: toward innovation and
increased variety, even at the risk of alienating old-guard purists.

We have invested years of our time, and hundreds of dollars of our money,
per capita, in a universe that is now being torn down, admittedly with
70 years\' leeway for the resolution of any or all existing storylines
and plenty of room for new ones. We have a right to be pissed off, and
(if we feel the need strongly enough) to vote with our wallets for the
destruction of TNE, and of GDW with it. But on the other hand, GDW has
the right to try to stay in business, doesn\'t it?

Let\'s wake up and smell the coffee, people. Just for a few minutes, let\'s
unstrap our laser carbines, take off our PRIS binocs, and look around the
real world for a minute, and see the fact that *we are a dying breed.*

It is true that in the late 1970s and early to mid 1980s, TRAVELLER was
an enormously popular game with a worldwide following, and the Imperium
is still the most detailed game universe ever.... but times change, and
the gaming community is certainly changing, all around us. The vast
majority of the TRAVELLER community that bought all those books has moved
on now, either to new games like SHADOWRUN that fit the modern gaming
milieu of violence, sex and teen-angst or out of the gaming world entirely.
We are all that\'s left, and we are not a very big community any more.
Hundreds of us, perhaps. Maybe even thousands. But NOT enough to keep
a company like GDW alive on the basis of our loyalty, especially when
every misstep on their part is instantly dissected and catcalled (sometimes
with good reason, viz. Shattered Ships, sometimes not so) by all of us.

If those proportions, the size of the community using an old rules system
and fiercely loyal to its creators in comparison to the size of the
community looking for something new/different/better, were applied to a
marketing strategy in any other form of commerce, the case for innovation
would be made instantly. Why should gaming be different?

There is a solid community of old-timers out here that can keep the old
Imperium alive, in fine detail, for decades, as a non-profit cottage
industry-- in fact, I encourage the TML and the HIWG to spearhead this
effort, by encouraging and distributing the materials produced by those
interested in preserving the old Imperial milieu. But it is unreasonable
to expect GDW to try to stay alive by pleasing us all, and it makes
perfect sense for them to use the TRAVELLER name as a springboard to
launch their newest SF effort. After all, "Economics Drives Design."

Okay, break time. At this point, I can hear a number of my dearest friends,
Mark Cook chief among them, snorting fire from their nostrils, steaming
from the ears, and muttering words like "Traitor" and "castrate" in my
general direction. They\'re not stupid, and neither am I: they know that
I am not, with that statement, shrugging my shoulders and giving GDW
carte blanche to do whatever they dman well please with our beloved
universe. This is the crux of saying "(Up To A Point)."

I am willing to work with GDW, to do constructive criticism, to
rewrite what needs to be rewritten (and make deadlines, now that my
Ph.D. is out of the way), and to heckle what DESERVES heckling-- and
what I consider to deserve heckling is any rules or background that
DON\'T WORK. If an idea makes sense to me, and I can see how and why it
was included to make TNE sell better in today\'s market, then I don\'t
care if it violates old-Traveller canon, although I hesitate to
approve retroactive changes in reality ("retcons," to comics readers).
But if an idea is just plain stupid or useless, or reflects bad
planning or thinking, then I reserve the right to say so, and loudly.

I will playtest TNE, if I\'m given the chance. I will buy it and work with
it. I will write folio modules for it, and contribute articles to CHALLENGE
for it, and help to make it a competitor to the other good games out there.
I will tolerate the massive changes to the old way of thinking that GDW
posits-- IF they\'re put forth in a workable manner. And that\'s my final word.

Now, on to my specific comments:

>     GDW admits they did not support MEGATRAVELLER (MT) adequately.
>An underlying reason was simply that they did not play MT, and so did
>not know the system very well.  As a result, temptation was too great
>to redirect support elsewhere.  GDW wasn\'t offering this reason as an
>excuse, only as an explanation.

This explains a whole hell of a lot. I\'m not saying that as an indictment,
only as an observation.

>     First off, TNE will belong to the GDW house role playing system.

This makes sense, if the new rules work reasonably well. I\'m not too old
to learn yet another rules system; I just want GDW to understand beforehand
that I will support the stuff they do right in as loud a voice as I can,
and I will come down on the stuff they do wrong like a ton of bricks.
This applies particularly to suspension not of disbelief but of known
physical realities. Loren once offered to use the people on the TML,
many of whom are scientists, to fix the serious problems in the science
that we DO know about (like thruster plates violating Conservation of
Energy). I sincerely hope that he\'ll keep that promise....

>     Second, its very easy for gaming groups to hop among GDW RP games
>and even borrow elements from one another.

Chaosium tried this and it didn\'t work very well. Stick to reason 1, it
makes more sense. (i.e. a house system is easier to bugfix and cheaper too).

>     Third, the house role playing system is a direct descendant of

This statement is meaningless propaganda. Reread it; it says absolutely
nothing. It\'s not classic TRAVELLER in rules or milieu, so what\'s left?

Oh, give me a break here! I\'m willing to spend money on products if
they\'re GOOD products; please don\'t insult my intelligence by saying
that you\'re not selling them to make money; you\'re either a liar or a
fool.  I can\'t tolerate either. You\'re damn right that growth is vital
to a game\'s longevity, but don\'t try to make us believe that the
initial sale is an act of charity. A loss-leader for followup
products? MAYBE I could swallow THAT, given my ignorance of the game

Interesting. I don\'t know how the 2300AD purists would swallow it, but
it\'d be better than nothing, one would hope. I also like the idea of
sourcebooks for the Ziru Sirka, the Ramshackle Empire, and maybe (hell,
I\'d write THIS one MYSELF!) the Third Imperium in the Sixth Century:
Expanding to reabsorb the Terran worlds, and developing the ideas that
we all take for granted (Jump-4? WOW!). Not to mention a sourcebook for
the Imperium in 1120 or so, as Strephon deals with Dulinor\'s failed
assassination attempt, the Naval conspiracies that surfaced in the
Fifth War, and the politicking of the Archdukes that he recently
reappointed....

All I can say is, it had better be an improvement. We\'ve had compatibility

I\'m actually looking forward to this, being one of the few people out
here who actually understands why the distance limit for stutterwarp was
set to the particular number of ly that it was. I\'ve had star gates as
Ancient artifacts in my Trav games for over thirteen years, and a system
for running a lower-tech version in place for nearly eight. I\'d LOVE
to get Traveller working with some of those ideas.

I\'d recommend it anyway. A simple diagram explanation as given in MAYDAY

old system of past, present and future position counters....

BZZZZT! Caught you here, people! This is a great idea, and very handy--
well worth reviving, by allowing a "less dense" universe. BUT! The whole
point of stutterwarp is that every star must be used as a stepping stone,
even if it\'s worthless. If stutterwarp was a retcon, and in use all over
the Imperium before the Short Nap, then there will exist large clouds of
well-known space in addition to the simple maps. Be careful!

This implies a major paradigm shift in the game, and one that I feel
others may have strong objections to. Expect long, drawn out treatises
from people with extensive economic backgrounds, demonstrating how that
is highly unlikely in any society capable of building ships at all.
But I won\'t be one of them-- in fact, I rather like the idea. One part
of TRAVELLER I never liked was that starships were neither appropriately
rare and costly nor appropriately cheap and easy to find.

And to Bertil, for his comment on the Metlay System of Space Combat:

That still doesn\'t remove the fact that the device used to get there

>     The silicon lifeforms of Cymbeline (see ADVENTURE 13 - SIGNAL GK)

A-HA! NOW things begin to get very interesting! This is not a computer
virus at all, this is a malevolent lifeform with the ability to self-
reproduce given suitable raw materials and adapt itself to a number of
different environments. THIS I can live with, with only one small
problem: the people at GDW seem to have forgotten that the Cymbeline
chips (called the Cmybiotica in my game, where they were and are a potent
plot thread) were only discovered and isolated in the early 1100s, and
a lot of their research was only preliminary before the Solomani bombed
Cymbeline into a cinder. I find it VERY difficult to believe that a
life form with dubious loyalty would, or could, be incorporated into
every starship in the Imperium and surrounds, particularly while Hard
Times were tearing down trade bridges rather than building them up.

I still wouldn\'t call this a virus, and the only way to put it in
place would be to retcon SIGNAL GK out of existence or push the events
therein at least one century earlier, preferably more. A minor point--
this sort of explanation actually sits better with me than any
computer-virus thing hinted at before. After all, the Cymbiotica are
not only sentient, they are also self-replicating and self-mobile!

This is perhaps the boldest move on GDW\'s part yet, since everyone in

habitable.  Personally, I want Science fiction in my Trav, not Science Fantasy.

And for god sake, tie population to world quality!  If a system is garbage and
not worth mining, keep it empty of people.  Perhaps a monitor station at best.

Again, taking the anology too far.  Do their Vacc suit helmets have horns

Good.  Trav wasn\'t, and TNE shouldn\'t be.  However, the idea of the Lone
peice of the Imperium, adrift with a sea of barbarian to Core, rim and
trailing (Assume the Zho\'s just sit there -- they are bigger now), sounds good.
You want "stability", stay in marches or Deneb.  Aye, but the big bucks and

Thinking back to my old ref, back in \'80, he didn\'t give too much worrk about
tech strangities, as long as it was consistant.  If the science is strange,
fine, as long as it fits with everything else.  The plates were a crock
because they were not consistant with newtonian physics.  But you can fudge
stutterwarp or jump physics, as long as you are consistant within that frame.

I dunno.  I can live with umpteen different ways to shuttle around a system,
be it orion systems, Fusion torches or Ion rockets, but I think the means to
pierce the \'c\' boundry should have a single basic form, with other systems
being variants of that.  Look at normal maneuver drives -- Be it Fusion, Ion
or Nuke bomb, it\'s all "action<->reaction".  It\'s that same idea, just with
variant ways of doing it.  The same should be with the star travel.
(Actually, musing along the lines of stutterwarp, it sounds a lot like
Saberhagen\'s C-Plus drive)

So while race A uses a system of stutterwarp that is very efficient, but
has a greatly reduced range before dischcharge (Very fast ships, but their
range is pretty poor, limiting their "known space"), while Race C has the
"Ion drive" of stutterwarps (Shit poor speed, but a very good range before
needing a discharge, resulting in a flung out empire with poor response times
to external threat), you get your "drive" differences.

Boarding actions are a really neat trick unless you have blown away
the maneuver drives in advance.  But if that is the way you want it...

And, as Metlay said, there will be massive economic treatises showing why
it ain\'t gonna be that way.  I\'ll probably write about half of them.  But
I agree that keeping ships rare is a good thing.  Though how you intend to
let PCs get their hands on one if they are that valuable is something I
am really curious about.

Actually, I can\'t see ANY science fiction plots made possible by the virus.
It looks more like background scenery to me.  Most likely, the permutations
possible will be beaten to death within six months of the game\'s release,
and ignored thereafter.  Who\'s willing to bet on whether the first TNE
adventure in Challenge will be a "virus" adventure?

So, why is it unique?  Are we defining anyone who uses it as "star vikings"?
Or is it a stupid enough design that sensible people don\'t want to use it?

And they\'re right, "Star Viking" is a stupid name. It was stupid when Piper
used the original ("Space Viking"), and it hasn\'t improved with age.  The
concept is interesting, the name is terrible...

Bravo!  Defining the technology of the Imperium did more to destroy my
suspension of disbelief than anything else, including "hard times".

DON\'T DO THIS!!!  The stutterwarp changes the whole picture of ship combat
SO MUCH that reconciling the original Imperium to TNE will be just about
impossible.  Keep in mind that a ship without a stutterwarp has a movement
of ZERO in combat with any ship WITH a stutterwarp.

If GDW has had a hard time getting good articles for Challenge, why do they
believe that they can now fill two magazines?  And why do they assume that
we will all be waiting eagerly to fill the pages of Challenge, if we haven\'t
before?

If Challenge decides to change its payment policies to something more
realistic, I\'ll send the a submission or ten also...

My first reaction to reading that bit of the original posting was HOW?
After some more thought, I have come up with some typically draconian
solutions.

Quite simple really.  If they are able to destroy planets, they could
have created a zone of no passage by sterilising a few systems in corridor.
[ The Darrian star trigger might be of great assistance here ].  Another
possibility is placing large interdiction fleets at stragetic locations
(again in corridor sector) that have orders to not let anything past.
The fleets would have to have no transponders of any kind or they would
become infected.

A less nasty solution might involve the creation of a preditor-preditor
type chip.  Make it a serendipitous creation to explains why only the
domain survived.  Oops, the Zhondani also survive it obviously they must
be using totally different computers.

Being a little faceious now: wouldn\'t the \'virus\' spread as fast as ships
moved?  Wouldn\'t this mean that it spread as fast as communication speed?
Which kind of implies that once you know the virus exists it is too late.

I think that \'plague\' is a better term than \'virus\'.


Lets just hope that GDW don\'t mash our beloved universe too much in
the transition to the new.

Traveller in the past, has had features unique to itself, and has also let
several gaming fads slip by without jumping on the bandwagon, and becoming yet-
another-generic-battlemech-cyborg-netrunner-psyionic-fantasy-robot game for
teenagers.  It\'s made minimal inclusions of each to accomidate fanatics, yet
Traveller has more of less stayed the same, and not let itself be jerked around
by \'new technology\'.

Traveller has been a game apart, and a standard.  But it has aged quite a bit,
and it has been jerked around quite a bit by several completely different rules
systems, and about a dozen different \'official\' publishers which were later
blacklisted and their material contradicted.

I like generic rules systems that can be applied consistantly to any type of
campaign or scenario.  But I also want Traveller to continue to have it\'s
unique flavor.

On Starships...

As with all equipment design, *real* terminology should be used, and it should
be consistant...  You should be able to tell if you can but a framistat in your
fighter, and why, and be able to design a fighter with a framistat if you want
to.  Be able to design ships with & without grav plates etc, and have there be
significant differences.  Have several different interplanetary and
interstellar drives for different cultures/races/empires. etc...

I don\'t like the \'fallen empire\' atmosphere.  I prefer the \'expanding empire\'
attitude.  But it\'s easier to move forward in time and crush the Imperium to
create frontiers then to move backwards to the point where the Imperium or some
subset of it had genuine frontiers...

Enough for now...

no, I don\'t think that\'s how it\'ll be. As I understand it, there will
be one book on the Imperium, which will only have jump drive. The
various other method of FTL travel and other stuff is in a different
book, which intends to make playing Traveller without using Imperium
background very easily.

  Unfortunately I have a hard time disproving the existance of engineers named
Sven, especially since my grandfathers brother was one:)

  I can however totally disprove the existance of horns on viking helmets.
The horns are an invention by the same age that gave us the fat singing lady
wearing the above (and a breastplate).
  Although horned helmets existed in the time period before the vikings
(a few hundred years or so) they were not used 850 to 1200 and were not even
present except on some old (religious) statues(1).

  An accurate comparision to showing vikings with horns would be to show US
marines charging up a beach wearing full plate armour.

  Comparing the general behaviour of the star vikings and their namesakes,
there is less of a difference that what people might believe. The star vikings
*seem* however to have a less profit-at-any-cost orientation that the
originals: The vikings often worked on the "if they are strong, we trade and
if they are weak, we take", while the star vikings apparently reason "if they
don\'t want to trade, we hose down the seat of government with orbital
artillery, and ask them once more; repeat until we get a \'yes\'".
  This might however be an artifact of knowing the whole story: We know that
the hivers are behind it to stabilize the frontier, while the star vikings
might think they do everything from a pure drive for profit.

  Comparisions to the Hanseatic League have been made, but IMHO the Hansa seems
to be a little on the bad side of the star vikings. They were basically a
German colonization operation out to totally monopolize the baltic trade and
install Hansa-loyal merchants as an major economic force in all the harbours of
the baltic sea.

- -bertil-
(1) And the horns on most of them was more of the \'deer\' type than the usual
    \'bullhorn\' which led me once to speculate in a pre-viking celtic
    connection. This so incensed an (american:) asatru fundamentalist that
    he started to behave like the average tv-evangelist. Fundies are nofun:)

  To formulate what Mike Mikesh said a little differently, GDW (Frank Chadwick,
I think, to be exact) said up front that one of the "why\'s" of TNE is that
Traveller as it stands (MegaTraveller) doesn\'t bring in enough revenue
and the little it does take in is shrinking due to loss of old players and
no regrowth.
  Furthermore they said that MegaTraveller has already accumulated so much
bad publicity (typos, no support, incomprehensible to neophytes etc) that it
is a lost cause, so the only solution is to scrap it and start over again.

> True, but if wild frontiers were ALL you wanted, why not just a new game,
> or better yet the wonderful forces set in motion in HARD TIMES?

  It might be that GDW noticed that what some people on TML said (that
Hard Times would either lead to a very short night on the order of a few
years or a long dark night on the hundreds of years scale, depending on what
assumptions one made) and decided that they still wanted a 70year night
for plot reasons and invented the mechanism to create one.

  If they had used Hard Times raw to achieve a 70year night, I would have
expected to see esseys here saying that the Hard Times mechanisms impossibly
could lead to a 70year long night:)

I hate the name.  TRAVELLER - NEW ERA sounds like the name for a source book,
not a set of rules.  How about calling the whole thing TRAVELLER and then
you can create a source book called TRAVELLER - NEW ERA and 2300AD and
TWILIGHT 2000 and DARK CONSPIRACY and 3rd IMPERIUM etc etc etc.

Why would a host of potentially hostile empires use the same circuitry to

Well for a start they don\'t kill you.  Also, JUMP-3+ drives give you better
range and speed.

Not very believable.  If you had the rare vessels you wouldn\'t send them out
alone.  And if you only had one or two you would be using them for research
to be able to rebuild/repair them.

You must be reading something I didn\'t receive.  Nobody said anything about
putting limits on TNE.  All they\'ve said so far is that things have changed
and won\'t be a "dark future".  Space is big and there is room for all sorts
of societies and phobias.  Actually, I could never see why a MECH was better
than a man portable anti-mech weapon.  RoboTech shoots itself in the foot
with each new technology change that comes out (their all shrinking in size
while rising in attack/defence/speed power).  Similar for the BattleTech junk.

It\'s the y-a-g-b-c-n-p-f-r teenagers that GDW are probably hoping to snare.

Fine.  Let GDW produce a generic rule book that defines all these technologies
and play rules.  Lets feed them our views and get it heading in a compatible
direction.  GDW can then create source book(s) for 2300AD, Twilight 2000,
Dark Conspiracy, IMPERIUM I, IMPERIUM II, TRAVELLER (IMPERIUM III), CYBERPUNK,
and for TRAVELLER - NEW ERA (IMPERIUM IV).  GDW are in it to make money and
this is where they will do it.  Its up to the GM to decide what\'s IN his/her
universe or which universe they\'re in.

So buy the master rules set and the appropriate source book for where you want
to exist.

Yeah.  How about just plain "Raiders".  But if the HIVERs are using them to
restore some semblance of civilization to humanity then they should be called
"Crusaders" or something similarly uplifting even though everyone else hates
their guts and calls em pirates.

Just because newtonian physics is the only one we currently have you shouldn\'t

Here\'s a possible technology path (Remember the time scale of the various
IMPERIUMs I thru III and the slow tech advancement relative to Earth in the
1800s thru to the 2300s):

TECH 8-9:   StutterWarp is discovered.
TECH 9-10:  JUMP Drive discovered as safe alternative to StutterWarp.
            StutterWarp still outperforms JUMP Drive.
TECH 11:    StutterWarp plateaus in usefulness.
            More and more travellers opting for safer JUMP Drive travel.
            StutterWarp and JUMP Drive not compatible on same ship.  Causes
            rapid buildup of StutterWarp radiation while in JUMP space [or
            something equally nasty].
TECH 13-14: JUMP Drive is new alternative and safe mode of travel.
            JUMP Drive "MIS-JUMPS" are identified as a potential problem.
            StutterWarp drive ships lose competitive edge and are phased out.
TECH 15-16: JUMP Drive has plateaued out but still the safest travel mode.
            "MIS-JUMPS" investigated and StarGate/Warp technology found.
            StarGates constructed but still need JUMP Drive to get to the
            two end points to build the gate in the first place.
TECH 17:    One way StarGates constructed, thus reducing need for JUMP Drive
            equiped vessels for exploration.
TECH 18-19: Mobile StarGates established allowing ships to generate own
            temporary StarGate field.

That could be the way the TRAVELLER - IMPERIUM star drive technology works
while other source books could have a slightly different technology
dependency.

There\'s nothing stopping all star drives being useful in a campaign universe.

I\'m not real happy about the TECH levels but ALL tech levels could happen in
a 100 year period in a rapidly expanding civilization.

 No. _Traveller: The New Era_ will use a variant of GDW\'s "house
 Role-Playing System," currently driving _Twilight: 2000_,
 _Dark Conspiracy_, and _Cadillacs and Dinosaurs_, although with some
 modifications to adapt it to SF adventure. At the Gen-Con Traveller
 seminars, one person walked out when hearing this news, but the rest
 of the group stayed and seemed pleased (many were overtly enthusiastic)
 with our plans).

 I was a Biology minor back in the stone age (when God was a teenager,
 and I was an undergrad), and I am part of the three-man design team
 that came up with the K\'kree and the Hivers (their original incarnations,
 not what DGP wrote about them later). One of the team is now taking a
 PhD in Paleontology at Uni Chi (he is also responsible for the various
 animal classifications in the original Traveller...Grazer, etc.). The
 other writes novels for a living. I also did a lot of the early Bestiaries
 in JTAS, and biology (primarily comparative zoology) is still a minor
 interest of mine. Count mine as another vote for more discussion of
 alien life forms...

 wrong, and if you ever again say that you, or anyone else, was "screwed
 by GDW," you better be ready to prove it in court, Mister. I am through
 tolerating this sort of irresponsible, dishonest bashing of our
 company\'s reputation in public.

 The original work on the virus was begun by me well over two years
 ago, was discussed in its early stages with the people from Digest
 Group, and was announced publicly in a seminar at GenCon \'91.
 These things are matters of public record.

 The people at GDW who are responsible for all of the on-going creative
 work on Traveller The New Era are myself, Dave Nilsen, Loren Wiseman, and
 Lester Smith. None of us have ever read your story, seen your ship design,
 or know much of anything about you. Loren Wiseman was the only one of us
 who had even heard of you, and that was only because Loren\'s job includes
 reading the TML conversations, in which I am told you participate quite
 often.

 Chuck Gannon is not a member of the GDW staff. Showing something to
 him does not constitute showing it to GDW. Chuck\'s position vis-a-vis GDW
 has been that of an outside artist. There was a recent problem with
 Rob Dean not being properly credited in a product submitted by Chuck
 Gannon, but this was the result of some confused communications, not an
 attempt to steal Rob\'s work. I don\'t believe that Rob feels "screwed" by
 GDW, but you should ask him yourself. And before you simply switch
 your attack and claim that he was deliberately "screwed" by Chuck, I
 would think twice. I have decided not to take action this time on what
 clearly constitutes a libel. Chuck may not be inclined to be so generous.

 Finally, Traveller, the Imperium, and its history, are the creation of
 GDW, and are our intellectual property. Do you really think that you
 can unilaterally take over part of this intellectual creation by
 writing an unsolicited story, sending it to someone, even one of us at
 GDW, and then cry THIEF! if anything remotely similar appear in the
 future? You cannot, and the attempt to do so makes YOU the attempted thief.
 Traveller, and its future history, are ours. Stop trying to steal them.

Journal Entry 065 / 1119 [ Language Barriers ]

     I leaned back in my chair and threw my legs carelessly up on
the table.  The familiar timorous howl of the jumpdrive was audible
through the inferior sound proofing of the scoutship\'s cramped
lounge as we left the Vargr Extents for the Imperium.

     Thorknorrz walked in a moment later, the short vargr engineer
sat down and yawned and stretched tremendously, fur rippling over
the steel bands of his muscles.

     Veronica climbed down from the turret to join us a moment
later.  I admired her well formed thighs as she came down.  Firm.
Nice...

     "Those customs boats are always a pain." she complained.  "I\'m
glad you guys speak gveg."

     "Well, you gotta be careful with the languages." agreed
Thorknorrz, "But once you can make yourself understood, you\'re ok."

     I corrected Thorknorrz. "*IF* you can make yourself
understood.  There have been a great many disasters spawned by just
a few mis-spoken words."

     "Yeah, yeah." Veronica rolled her eyes.  "Come on, Chris, just
a few words?  If you can\'t speak the language, how can you say
enough to really screw it up?  I just don\'t buy it."

     "Oh, believe me." I cautioned her, "One of the biggest
disasters I\'ve seen was just because of one mixed up *syllable*!"

     "Yeah, right."

     I took a deep breath and thought back, the details were there,
but it was a stretch to bring them back up.  I pulled out a wine
bottle from the table\'s fridge and some glasses from the cabinet.
"This was *years* ago:  back when I was in high school in Glisten.
I was only sixteen.  I had only been learning gveg for a few
months, and the only phrase I knew with any confidence was
\'Gvedreng ver galgalrrik?\'"

     Thorknorrz snorted and chuckled his amusement as I poured
three glasses.  Veronica looked confused, so Thorknorrz translated.
"Do you speak galanglic?"

     I nodded.  "Exactly.  Now, my gveg teacher, Mr. Babbit wanted
us to try out our gveg as much as possible.  So, during our
vacation, he arranged for passage over to Brrelin:  an asteroid in
the Glisten Belt which was entirely vargr.  Of course, most of them
speak galanglic, so I felt I couldn\'t get into *too* much trouble.
There were other students going:  one of the fourth year gveg
students, Rick.  He was almost fluent.  Anne was going,  she was
decent in gveg.  But there were three of us who spoke little or
none at all."

     "So there were five of us.  Rick and I were the only guys, the
three girls:  Anne, Christine, and... oh yes...  Renee.  Yeah,
that\'s it.  And, of course, Mr. Babbit.  The girls were some of the
cutest in our school so of course I *had* to go."

     Thorknorrz grinned.  His tail wagging slightly.

     Veronica ignored him.

     I took a sip of wine.  "The trip over was fairly uneventful.
We hopped a shuttle over to Brrelin.  Took quite a while.  There
was only one memorable incident on the flight."

     I paused for a breath as Thorknorrz and Veronica waited for
the other shoe to drop.  "You see, Anne always managed to confuse
\'Voo\' and \'Vrere\'.  That is:  Where and Who.  So the flight
attendant was rather confused when Anne asked her, \'Vrere gver shir
gvologahn?\'"

     Thorknorrz smiled.

     Veronica shrugged.

     Thorknorrz translated, "Who are the toilets?"

     Veronica just rolled her eyes.

     I continued, "Well, as I said, it was a long flight, and we
all arrived over there pretty tired.  So we got out of the
spaceport and headed over to our hotel.  We weren\'t staying at the
TAS hostel, because we wanted in on the local culture.  But, Mr.
Babbit had picked a decent hotel right on the main street in
Brrelin.  I forget the name of the hotel, but we were right on
Grroatfurstenbar.  Or the \'Groatbar\' as the Brreliners called it.
But by the time we got there, the Groatbaren were out on the
streets."

     Thorknorrz was barking his laughter, so I had to explain it to
Veronica this time:  "Groatbar is the street\'s nickname.  The local
prostitutes are known as the Groatbaren:  Which translates as
\'Groat ladies\'."

     Veronica\'s eyes rolled.

     I shrugged and continued, "Well, ol\' Babbit was out of it.  He
was asleep on his feet, but of course a bunch of teenagers out in
a strange place with lots of new things around weren\'t exactly
ready to quiet down yet.  So, when Babbit collapsed in his room,
Rick went out to secure some refreshments."

     I held up my wine glass to demonstrate what refreshments I had
in mind.  Veronica grinned.

     "Unfortunately, he bought the most *awful* wine you\'ve ever
tasted.  One sip, and I didn\'t want any part of it.  Besides,
someone had to stay alert.  So Rick, Anne, Christine and Renee
proceeded to *drink* that turpentine and got themselves fairly
merry."

     I paused for a moment to refresh Thorknorrz and Veronica\'s
glasses.  "So there I was, the only sober one in a room full of
drunken teenagers.  Rick was plastered, slurring every second word.
But the girls weren\'t in such bad shape...  Except..."

     Veronica looked suspicious.  "Except?"

     I paused for thought.  "Well...  Nothing really...  They
decided to wave at the passers by on the street...  Nothing wrong
with that...  Except...  Well, the Groatbaren were selling their
wares right around our hotel.  There was quite a crowd.  I began to
wonder if someone might get the wrong idea.  I mean, after all,
here *I* am with the welfare of three teenage girls in my hands,
and I had better look out for them, right?"

     Veronica nodded.  It seemed reasonable.

     "But," I continued, "I didn\'t know enough gveg to explain to
anyone that this was all in innocence.  What to do?  I was getting
worried.  A crowd was starting to gather."

     Thorknorrz was intrigued.  His ears focussed completely on me.

     I drew a deep breath.  "So, at first I tried to just persuade
the girls not to sit in the window, but they were too drunk to want
to listen to me...  I was getting desperate.  Rick was useless, I
thought and thought and thought."

     I sipped again from my glass and made a show of having a dry
throat.

     Veronica was growing impatient.  "Well, what happened?"

     "Well, I thought for a while, and decided that I had no
alternative except to try to explain.  All I would need would be
just *one* word.  I\'d tell the crowd that the girls were just
crazy...  Not... Groatbaren.  So, I went over to Rick."

     "Rick!  Wake up!  What\'s the gveg word for crazy?"

     "Well, Rick was pretty dead to communication so it took a
while to squeeze it out of him, but he finally told me \'Gverrut\'
for which the plural was \'Gverruten\' I needed the plural for the
three girls, obviously!"

     Thorknorrz nodded.

     I beamed.  "So, armed with this new word I went triumphantly
over to the window and announced to all Brrelin that these three
beautiful teenage girls were Gvekauften!"

     Thorknorrz jaw hit the floor.  He was paralyzed a moment with
disbelief before he doubled over convulsing with his earsplitting
vargr laughter. "HARF!  HARF!  HARF!  HARF!"

     Veronica just stared at us both.

     "A riot broke out!" I continued, further reducing Thorknorrz
to a helpless pile of giggling fur, "I pulled the girls inside and
locked all the doors and windows.  It wasn\'t long before the police
arrived to quiet things down.  Fortunately, *they* spoke galanglic,
but they could barely believe that I had made such an awful
mistake."

     Veronica was steamed.  She just shook her head.

     Finally, Thorknorrz calmed down enough to explain it between
the splutters of his giggles.  "He tried to say \'Ver baret ged
gverruten.\':  \'The girls are crazy\'  But he said \'Ver baret get
*gveKAUFten*\'!:  \'The girls are *FOR SALE*!"

The only problem with this techline is that the stutterwarp is a better
drive than the Jump-drive.  The Kennedy from 2300AD is about as fast as
a J-6 ship, even when including time required to discharge the drive.

Typical warship speeds are J-4 or better in equivalent speed.

And using stutterwarps with Traveller era fusion plants could easily
produce warships that approach J-8.  Or more for large ships.
{NOTE: Theoretical limit of pseudovelocity for a stutterwarp ship is about
J-9 equivalent}  Plus the advantage of being able to get somewhere in less
than 7 days.  Plus the advantage of NOT having to get somewhere in seven
days (or at ANY set time).

And a 6G warship is essentially stationary compared to even the slowest
stutterwarp ship in tactical combat.  So if the stutterwarp and Jump
drives were incompatible on the same ship (which makes almost no sense -
sort of like saying a diesel and a gas turbine cannot be run on the same
ship), then offensive operations across interstellar distances would be
impossible - the defending ships would all have stutterwarps, the offending
ships would have 6Gs, and would be annihilated by the stutterwarp defenders.

So no Imperium.  Ever.  Note also that stutterwarp is better than J-1 or J-2
even in terms of distances travellable.  7.7 light years is more than 2
parsecs after all.  So why didn\'t the First Imperium use them?  And if it
did, and there were fundamental incompatibilities between Jump and stutter-
warp, how did the development of J-3 by the Terrans accomplish anything?

I take it that anyone who writes an adventure for Traveller/MT/TNE is
also stealing your intellectual property?  Could make it hard on anyone
who wants to submit anything to Challenge.  As well as making it tough
on anyone who wants to GM any of these games...

This has gotten way out of hand.  Over on GEnie, another disgruntled

he got blasted, personally, for doing so.

And with the latest attempt at acting like TSR (libel suit threats), I have
definitely decided _not_ to buy any more of GDW\'s materials and I urge others
to do likewise.

From what I remember of Scott\'s posts, there was initmation of theft but no

holes in the idea of theft.

And the idea of charging Scott with theft is absurd!  I can write whatever
story I damn well please but if I don\'t make any money off it, GDW can\'t
do diddly other than to harrass, and this latest sure seems like they have
resorted to harrassment.

BTW, on GEnie, the GDW president has identified that he has notified his
employees not to reply to anyone making negative comments.

Sorry, Metlay, they won\'t reply...well, maybe they\'ll make an exception for
the TML seeing as how the GDW president hasn\'t applied the same to TML posts.

Yep, but only because the rest of us paid for it for years and years.
Take your ball and go home, Frank, and I\'ll take my dollars and do the
same.  Sounds like the game won\'t be worth playing in the future
anyway.

The original post hardly merited this kind of response.

I would hope that people would see this point as axiomatic. I really don\'t
mind a new version of a favorite gaming system (ability to spare the cash,
or willingness, being another question), witness my near-blind leap of faith
when I bought MT. (Though solely as a result of the PBeM, I might note.) As
a current politician might say, the issue is change. Of course, the obvious
retort is change to what? This, of course, is the real reason behind the
sound and fury. I wonder if anyone objects to the pure concept of a new
version.

And damn proud of it, too. I doubt very much of us are follow the crowd

The car may be great, the road may look clear, but I really wonder where the

"Some men just don\'t like to be driven."

Award winning, because if any company can shovel out such patently bad

Give them a gold star if they can REALLY say Award-Winning and MT in the

Amen, brother. We want to be able to design, really design ships but not
take as long as it does to design a REAL ship. I would be sorely disappointed
if it just turns out to be a bland and faint echo of what we have now. Some

Keeping in mind the advantage of a combat system that can be used without

    'body' => 'I have some thoughts on the multiple drive systems in TNE.

The _2300AD_ stutterwarp drive was theoretically limited to 7.7 light years
before discharge. Presumably, the version in TNE will have the same limitation.

However, there are several ways to dodge this limit. First, another ship can
carry the first part-way to the destination, where the drive of the carried
ship is brought online--offline stutterwarp drives are not subject to buildup.

Second, a suitable gravity well can be found (such as a brown dwarf) to
discharge at.

Third, a skilled engineer can delay the discharge by one day, during which time
a fast ship can travel a considerable distance.

Fourth, an option not open in _2300AD_--use stutterwarp only as a maneuver
drive and use a conventional jump-drive for long distances.

Stutterwarp drives must discharge into a 0.1G gravity well, which takes 40
hours. Stutterwarps cycle hundreds of thousands of times per second--compare
this to a flicker rate of 29.97 frames per second for NTSC video. Each
individual stutter carries the ship only a few hundred meters at most.

As Steve pointed out, conventional maneuver-drive ships are motionless when
compared to a stutterwarp ship. The _Kennedy_ class cruisers, a good example
of a fast stutterwarp ship, can manage an in-system speed of .3c, and a deep-
space speed of 1755.65c. Compare this to a jump-2 ship, which has an FTL speed
of 339.04c. Although a J-3 ship or better can go places a stutterwarp ship
can\'t, the stutterwarp ship can (if discharge points exist) cross 6 parsecs
about as fast as a J-6 ship can.

Most of the systems in the Imperium are accessible by stutterwarp without even
considering those "worthless" stars that were omitted from the maps.

Stutterwarp ships are actually "not there" along most of there flight path--
they only occupy a small part of the space they pass through. In addition,
they are fast enough to outrun any weapon that does not travel at the speed
of light, or use a faster stutterwarp. A ship with stutterwarp is very hard
to hit--sort of like a factor 9 black globe that never overloads. Therefore,
all ship weapons in _2300AD_ are either lasers or particle beams that can be
aimed precisely enough to hit a target when it "is there".

All of this means that the introduction of stutterwarp into the Imperium (or
remains thereof) would have some very drastic effects. First, any non-
stutterwarp ship becomes instantly obsolete as a warship. Second, merchants
with J-1 or J-2 ships are put out of business overnight, and captains of
ships with better jump drives will have to either find a route with stops 3
parsecs or more apart, or go out of business as well. J-6 merchants are fast
enough to compete with even the fastest stutterwarp ships, and J-3 to J-5 can
cross distances as fast as the slower stutterwarp ships, but wherever the route
has distances of 2 parsecs or less the stutterwarp will be faster.

Obviously, stutterwarp having existed all along in the background is a totally
absurd idea, and I suspect that the people at GDW must realize this. I think it
is safe to assume that stutterwarp in the Imperium will be a recent invention.

This raises another point--whoever invented it would, logically, use it to go
out and stomp all over everyone else until they had reunited the Imperium. GDW
has already pretty much said that nobody has done so, however. Therefore,
either stutterwarp was invented by some highly idealistic planet which has
never shared the technology and would never dream of conquering their neighbors
(yeah, right!), or GDW is ignoring logic again. Based on what I have heard of
the virus, and the whole TNE setting, I am forced to conclude that the latter
is more likely.

 ... and you wonder why GDW spells MUD to some people, as the litigious society
nearly strikes again. "Hey, we have a problem. Perfect solution -- SUE \'EM!"
What did we have here? One posting, by an admittedly irate and emotional
person (as I think Scott would have to concede) when he had, in his own mind,
reason to be pissed. Does this make him right in accusing before verifying?

No, but neither does this justify your response. Would you REALLY have sued
Scott for libel if you hadn\'t been feeling so generous? (sarcasm alert) Really?
Do you think GDW has suffered in sales or will suffer? Have people suddenly
thought less of you? I would think that something on the order of "Fighting
(deleted) of the Shattered Imperium" would do more damage to a corporate or
personal reputation. So, but for a fit of generosity on your part, you would
gleefully waste hours and hours of time and gobs and gobs of money (in an
endeavor of probably astounding economic inefficiency, unless, of course,
you are a lawyer) all for the sole purpose of getting the emotional
satisfaction of having "gotten" Scott, since I doubt that the company or
you would benefit in any real sense. (If Scott is anything like the average
grad student that I know, he\'d be a proverbial turnip as far as recovering
damages.)

Save the lawyer talk for a truly important situation and not as the typical
nuclear response to a small sniper attack. That would probably be better
for all concerned.

(Additionally, "irresponsible"? Perhaps. "dishonest"? Now, I think that is
going a bit too far, but in light of your subsequent comments, merely the
tip of the iceberg.)

While you are undoubtedly correct, in a literal sense, it does come off as
arrogant and pompous. A more reasoned, rational response would be much more
appreciated. You may have genuine outrage and such, but you should know
better. The clear imputation of this paragraph is to call Scott Kellogg a

one, would consider bringing along some weenies to any GDW roast.)

Next time, write two letters. In the first one, write into it all the angry,

Really go at it and release the tension. It will make you feel better. Then
write a calmly rational and reasoned response, pointing out the errors and
mistakes and, if you like, cautioning against such outbursts. Or even
ignore the outburst. Mail the second letter.

I doubt it would ever fly.  If I was a peaceful merchantman being harassed
by pirates, I suspect that I would be less concerned with the condition of
his ship than he is with mine.  So for the several hours he tries to get
close enough to board, I think I would be burning big ugly holes in his
ship.  And popping nukes off nearby.  And his "grapplingboat" would have
to get through a cloud of missiles and laserbeams intact before he would
even have a CHANCE to dock.
Board and storm only works if (1) the stormers don\'t care what the condition
of the target is when they get there (and so can afford to blow big, ugly
holes in the ship to kill its weapons and M-drives first), or (2) BOTH
ships WANT to board and storm.  Which would be an insane attitude for a
merchantman to have.
It also helps to keep in mind that the pirate only has 4.5 hours to detect
the target and close with it before the jump button is pushed.  Only 1.5
hours if the merchant captain is willing to take a chance on a 10 diameter
jump.  So that pirate has got to be awfully close by to have a chance in
hell of executing a boarding action.  (within 425,000Km, assuming ideal
geometry for the chase, and that the pirate can detect the target, and
begin chasing within 10 seconds of the target\'s departure from orbit.  And
that only gives the pirate about 5 seconds to execute his boarding action
before the jump button is pushed.  If we allow ten minutes for a boarding
action (which is optimistic, unless merchant captains are chosen for abject
stupidity), then 300,000Km is the critical distance, again assuming ideal
geometry for the chase, and a start within seconds of the target\'s
departure.  This is assuming a 1G merchant and a 6G pirate, of course.)

Is there a way to limit shutterwarps to even shorter ranges precluding their
use as long haul drives?

Exactly how maneuverable are shutterwarp equipped ships?  (no, I haven\'t ever
read Trav 2300 so I don\'t know).  Would it be possible to have the occasional
hop occur perpendicular to the desired direction of travel (but in a random
direction)?  This would be the ultimate side-step and any point target weapon
is going to be useless against such a ship (because they\'d never be able to
hit except by chance and even then the hit would have a tiny duration).

Also, would the fact the the drive is cycling in the high kHz range going to
mean proximity weapons are useless (unless they can follow the target while
detonating).

No they aren\'t -- a SW ship is MUCH more efficient with the fuel then a Jump
Drive.  The J-6 merchant ends up hauling more fuel then cargo.

Another point is SW courier missiles, acting in a pony-express means, would
make the expressboat system look like garbage.

In other words, compared to the advantagaes of SW, why would Jump even be
considered EXCEPT as a bridge over voids in space?

Like I mentioned before, I say just have SW and tweak the paremeters to create
your different drive systems.

already a squad leader advancement system.

Just a question.  Is 1D20 somehow superior in some way I don\'t know
about?

One idea we came up with in the PBEM would allow a ship to become
virtually unhittable.  With the enormous distances ship-to-ship
combat takes, there is often a significant lag in the time it takes
for the light from one ship to reach the other - i.e. for a fraction
of a second, you don\'t see the ship that\'s just jumped in, however
they can see you since you\'ve been sitting there reflecting light
for as long as you\'ve been there.

The equipment we used was a teleporter, but a stutterwarp could
easily take the same place assuming you can control the direction
of the stutterwarp to a certain degree (This is the first I\'ve heard
of stutterwarps).  If you can induce enough random motion into your
stutterwarp flight path, you become a practically unhittable target.
The opposing ship only has the light they receive to gague your position
by, and that info is at least a fraction of a second old (off by a
couple hundred km at least if I read correctly how stutterwarps work),
and your flight path is nearly unpredicatable, hence any light-speed
weapon will miss.  Meanwhile, the ship doing the stutterwarping always
has a good target because the other ship isn\'t jumping all over the
place.

You could do something similar with M-6 if you were far enough away
from the opposing ship, but you need to be able to change directions
and positions really quickly for this to be an effective tactic.

Sure.  Raise your hand, and say "So let it be written, so let it be done."

SO what?  The BIG problem with stutterwarp is that it is too useful in
combat.  And would do terrible things to everyone\'s favorite pirates:
time to jump-point, aboard the Kennedy: 135 seconds.  Think about it.

A stutterwarp ship moving 0.3c thataway can reverse course and speed in less
than 30 seconds.

[]  I can however totally disprove the existance of horns on viking helmets.
[]The horns are an invention by the same age that gave us the fat singing lady

Well, while not accurate history wise, that seems to be the impression I have
gotten from watching TV and movies.

Lord Krieg notes, on stutterwarp...
[]As Steve pointed out, conventional maneuver-drive ships are motionless when
[]compared to a stutterwarp ship. The _Kennedy_ class cruisers, a good example
[]of a fast stutterwarp ship, can manage an in-system speed of .3c, and a deep-
[]space speed of 1755.65c.

Yes, the big advantage of a SW.  The more juice, the faster you haul.  Throw
on an Anti-matter plant and you will *scream*.

[]All of this means that the introduction of stutterwarp into the Imperium (or
[]remains thereof) would have some very drastic effects. First, any non-
[]stutterwarp ship becomes instantly obsolete as a warship. Second, merchants
[]with J-1 or J-2 ships are put out of business overnight, and captains of
[]ships with better jump drives will have to either find a route with stops 3
[]parsecs or more apart, or go out of business as well. J-6 merchants are fast
[]enough to compete with even the fastest stutterwarp ships,

No they aren\'t -- a SW ship is MUCH more efficient with the fuel then a Jump
Drive.  The J-6 merchant ends up hauling more fuel then cargo.

Another point is SW courier missiles, acting in a pony-express means, would
make the expressboat system look like garbage.

In other words, compared to the advantagaes of SW, why would Jump even be
considered EXCEPT as a bridge over voids in space?

Like I mentioned before, I say just have SW and tweak the paremeters to create
your different drive systems.

Okay, now tell me if I\'ve got it wrong, but...

1) Negative critcism will no longer be given an ear by GDW staff (and could
   someone tell me just what `positive criticism\' is?).

2) The game design will be entirely in-house. No outside rules suggestions or
   assistance will be solicited or accepted.

Now, it seems to me that unless we are expected to provide cheerleading or
moral support, GDW is simply wasting its time with the TML. I mean, we can\'t
say what we don\'t like anymore, nor can we be all positive and toadeating and
talk about how we could make it better. What purpose do we serve (as far as
GDW is concerned)? None, as far as I can tell.

- ----

Traveller is dead. I mean yes, they keep claiming that they are going to fix
it (again) and it\'ll be all great and everything, but I think many of us here
(if not most of us) now understand that there will be insult upon injury
to the fair Imperium, with the senseless, unplayable Hard Times being followed
by a plot device too stupid for even a Star Trek: TNG plot - the dreaded
virus. Yeah, right. Oh boy. I can just feel the excitement in the air.

Like the death of Cliff Burton turned Metallica from a leading-edge great
band into a bunch of pop singers, the lack of spirit in GDW shows. Whether
keeping Marc would have helped (MT was a disaster), I dunno. But I don\'t see
how things could have turned out worse. I am seriously considering not buying
any GDW product again (on principle; the lack of quality is another point
entirely), and I am certainly not alone in this.

- ----

So what to do? Right now, it looks like we get to sit around and watch what
we once new get turned to trash (can\'t you just see new covers replete with
cleavage, lots or random encounter tables, and lits of redundant weapons?),
or do something else. My personal feeling is that the competence, imagination,
and enthusiam on this list far exceeds that at GDW. No one here is looking to
make a quick buck on the game, no one here looks likely to sell out.

Why not try again (TDR, sort of)? Forget the rules. There are plenty of okay
systems out there (GRURPS, Hero, etc.) that could easily be adapted. What
I mean more is to like redo the Library Data, from scratch. Using 1992 science
understanding, I feel that even as a committee we could do a lot better.
Simply have people submit library entries, and built the future from that.
Add AIs before TL 90 (or whatever), leave out the anthropomorphic aliens,
have a real engima, no grav plates, 3-D universe, etc. A collection of 2-5
paragraph entries for dozens of things , I think, could be a useful, fun
project. Much better than watching Traveller rot, anyway.

Comments, complaints, whining (GDW staff, I mean) anyone?

I would hope that people would see this point as axiomatic. I really don\'t
mind a new version of a favorite gaming system (ability to spare the cash,
or willingness, being another question), witness my near-blind leap of faith
when I bought MT. (Though solely as a result of the PBeM, I might note.) As
a current politician might say, the issue is change. Of course, the obvious
retort is change to what? This, of course, is the real reason behind the
sound and fury. I wonder if anyone objects to the pure concept of a new
version.

The car may be great, the road may look clear, but I really wonder where the

"Some men just don\'t like to be driven."

Award winning, because if any company can shovel out such patently bad

Give them a gold star if they can REALLY say Award-Winning and MT in the

Amen, brother. We want to be able to design, really design ships but not

if it just turns out to be a bland and faint echo of what we have now. Some
people DO like detail. We shall see...

     Miakr\'s eyes nearly fell out as his doctor checked over the
stitched up holes in his abdomen:  for just a second, Jietlshaiepr
had bent over in such a way that... Viepchakl, she\'s...
     "You\'ll live." she snorted,  "It\'s more than you deserve
letting yourself get caught like that.  Be glad I didn\'t find you
before Lt. Jones did.  I\'d have finished you off.  What did you
think you were you doing stepping in front of an advanced combat
rifle anyway?"
     Miakr didn\'t dare sigh his relief.  Jietlshaiepr was an
excellent surgeon, but she feigned laziness.  She put on a show of
resentment if anyone got her nice clean sick bay bloodied up.
     "You\'ve got a tear in your liver that\'s healing, and your
small intestine was ripped up.  Messy surgery.  You were lucky.
Remind me to beat the tar out of you when you\'re recovered."
     Miakr felt the hum of the drives, "Where are we heading?"
     "Pulling along side the VIXEN.  Badly damaged but we\'re
putting a salvage team aboard.  We will see if it has anything
aboard worth salvaging."
                             - II -
     Shtam drank deeply from the Welles brew they\'d brought aboard
and mopped his forehead.  Hours of salvage work in battle dress had
soaked him in sweat.  The VIXEN was a twisted wreck.  The jump
drive was melted into a blob of fused alloy, and the maneuver drive
had been smashed off its mounting and completely thrown off the
ship.  The number two turret pylon had snapped:  the tower was a
broken stalk of celery with long strips of hull plate ripped out of
it.  Number one turret was hit along its mounting and, though
nearly undamaged, it could not turn.  Number three caught fragments
and was so much perforated cheese.  The main missile bay was badly
damaged with three quarters of the missile tubes ripped open or
melted away.  The compartments of the fuel tanks were cracked open
like a carton of eggs.  They had been nearly empty when they came
out of jump, and when the last few drops of hydrogen fuel bled
away, the VIXEN died.
     Shtam shook his head and pursed his lips, "She can never fly
again.  She had already exceeded her expected life:  VIXENs are not
designed to be used more than once.  The hull can not stand the
strain of the full weapons load.  The robot ships are meant to fly
a single attack mission and be destroyed.  This VIXEN was used
before.  She can never be used a third time."
     "We found the master robot director was intact." announced
Vole.  "The robots on the VIXEN are slave units:  not capable of
independent action.  With the master unit intact, we can use them.
Without it, the robot bodies are just unguided junk."
     Shtam summarized the salvage, "Three robots, probably
repairable, along with bits and pieces of the others.  We have five
more high explosive missiles.  There are some nuclear missiles
aboard, but they will not fit our missile racks so we grabbed the
warheads and left the boosters.  We removed some of the sensor
equipment and avionics, but it is not as advanced as Flamboyant\'s
sensors, so it can not really help to replace it, and besides we
would have a tough time calibrating it."
     "We could sell it." pointed out Miakr looking up from his bed.
Miakr\'s eyes were heavy as well from the exertion of overseeing
Vole in the salvaging.  "The VIXEN is higher tech stuff than nearly
all the planets around here.  I\'m sure somebody\'d pay for it, even
if it\'s just junk to us.  In the mean time, I\'ve got some robots to
play with..."
                             - III -

     "Welcome to Zylath.  This is Starport control broadcasting to

     The recording continued to repeat itself.

     Gresha shook her head to clear it.  The psi-null-drugs would
give her a temporary psi-shield, but the initial headache involved
was tiresome.
     She looked up from the holo display, "Picking up another ship
approaching the starport.  Small...  Five hundred megawatts...
Looks like a scout ship...  Hard to tell at this range, but I make
her out as a Ninz class scout...  On base leg in the traffic

transponder as SX-6457 I.S. All Nighter."
     Niedrsha frowned.  "Imperial registry?  A Consulate built Ninz
class scout?"
     Gresha nodded.
     "Pirate?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     Gresha lifted one lip and shrugged, "No way to tell from
here."
     "What about other ships?"
     "None.  I don\'t read any activity whatsoever in system.
Zylath must have a pretty big power plant though:  high neutrino
emission."
     Niedrsha raised an eyebrow, "This system is supposed to have
a strong mining operation in it."
     "Then, they\'re on strike..."
                              - V -
     The Flamboyant settled into the huge elongated hexagonal
hanger of the starport, nestling closely with the All Nighter.
Truly an odd sight:  a Consulate built scout with the Imperial
sunburst parked next to an Imperial built gun boat with the
circular Consular crest.
     The All Nighter was painted black with a colorful dragon\'s
head over the nose of the ship.  Just behind the left ear of the
dragon was a painting of a nude human female reclining on a
mattress along with the name plate:  "All Nighter".
     Niedrsha leered at Jietlshaiepr and nodded towards the
Flamboyant\'s nose.  "Our\'s ought to fit right in.  I told ya it was
a good idea."
     Flamboyant\'s nose had been repainted.  A young woman smiled
mischievously out at the universe along with the ship\'s adopted
name:  "Miscat Zhje Gorrne."  translation:  "Target for tonight".
Kfoks and Shtam had produced an excellent work of art, but
Jietlshaiepr was still angry over a certain resemblance.
     The hanger door closed and the bay began to pressurize.
                             - VI -
     Chilled stale air crept through the airlock.
     The pilot was tall for an imperial, with longish dark hair,
medium heavy build.  "Greetings," The word echoed and died in the
crypt of the hanger.  The imperial pilot spoke Zhodani formally
with a strange accent, reminiscent of zhodani nobility but with a
strong imperial overtones.  His speaking came with some difficulty
and he seemed amused by the novelty of the language as he spoke it.
"I am Jeff Ralampago, pilot of the All Nighter.  This is my gunner
Gdeerzorr."  The human gestured toward a tall female Vargr with a
black and white coat who stared distrustfully through Flamboyant\'s
airlock.
     Ralampago continued smiling, "We looking around the port and
no one is afoot.  I wonder if you may know where people are.  I
never have gone through this port."
     "I am afraid you are under a misapprehension." observed
Jietlshaiepr studying the pair, "We are not from this system."  She
closed her eyes to recite the little story Kfoks had written,
"We\'re here to conduct some prospecting investigations for Consular
mining cooperations."
     "Ah, I see.  Good luck.  Which cooperation is that?"
     "I\'m afraid I\'m not at liberty to say, publicity you see...
Don\'t want to stir people up with false ideas."
     Ralampago seemed to have gotten lost in the translation.
Confusion swept momentarily over his face and he smiled politely.
"If you look for some experienced prospectors, my brother has been
operating here for time:  Miguel Ralampago.  He knows the system
very well."
     "Thank you."
     Jietlshaiepr came through the airlock followed closely by
Niedrsha, Kfoks, Tuerz, Shtam, and Vole.  The hanger holding the
two ships was indeed deserted.  A curious silence hung over the
scene as Flamboyant\'s crew studied the cavernous hanger.
     "It appears as though this hanger has not been used in some
time." commented Shtam as he noted a thin layer of dust scuffed
aside by his boots.
     "What\'s the local time?" asked Kfoks.
     "About point eight of the local day has past..." thought
Niedrsha aloud, "Call it mid evening...  Perhaps they\'re all out to
dinner..."
     "Or out to lunch." growled Tuerz.
                             - VII -
     Steps spiralled down from the hanger airlock through cold,
hewn stone.  Heels clicked as the two crews descended.
     The stairs emptied out at the southern end of the main street.
Deserted.  The avenue stretched the length of the underground
cavern lined with quonset huts and small buildings.  Silent side
roads intersected along its length.
     No movement anywhere.
     Tuerz ears twitched constantly as the group moved down the
center of the empty avenue.  The bitter air was heavily laden with
silence.  A ventilator began to hiss softly through chilling teeth
far away.
     Several of the closer huts were blocked up.  Paint peeled back
from the aluminum structures while rags hung from broken windows.
     Shtam eyed the surrounding structures "Vole, what is the
listed population here?"
     "Nine hundred thirty six."
     "When was that?"
     "Eighteen years ago."
     Shtam looked about at the buildings and nodded grudgingly, "It
looks as though there might have been enough housing here for
that... a tight fit perhaps, but it could have been enough."
     They continued down the street, filing past deserted huts in
varying states of disrepair.  None showed any sign of recent
occupation.  Broken windows stared like dark eyes at the intruders
as though they defiled the cave row of tomblike buildings.
     "Looks like a great place to recruit miners." sneered
Gdeerzorr as she looked about studying the place.  She walked close
by Ralampago sniffing the air for non existent traces.
     Kfoks sniffed at the air also, but more to savor the slightly
musky, sweet scent of the vargr female beside him, "Well, we can
always bring in miners from out system.  After all, the tech level
here isn\'t too high, we\'d have to train anyone we hired here."
     "I\'m picking up some life." reported Vole.  "Four three
degrees, range:  ninety meters."
                            - VIII -
     SPACE WINDS was the only inhabited place they passed.  The bar
had its windows still intact, though its neon sign was flickering,
and several letters were dead.  On one side of the sign the entire
word \'space\' was out, while the stylized rounded letters distorted
the remaining word into \'WINOS\'.
     Ralampago entered first, "Hello...?"
     No answer came from the decidedly silent clientele.  Four of
them stared from where they sat, then they stood and prepared to
leave.  No one was behind the bar.
     "Well," asked Ralampago, "What do you do to get service around
here?"
     Three men stood by the bar, staring coldly, without speaking,
one of them rang a service bell.
     "WELL!  Well!  Well!" the bray shattered the stillness like a
sledge hammer on an ice cube.  The bartender appeared out of a back
room, a short, balding zhodani with a long thick mustache, "Welcome
to the old Space Winds!  What\'ll you have?  Eh?  HAW!  HAW!  HAW!"
     The laugh did not dispel the silence of the place.
     "Beer!" called Niedrsha.
     "Brandy." said Jietlshaiepr cautiously.
     Kfoks tail waved slightly, "Vodka martini, stirred not shaken,
it bruises the gin."
     "How about beer all round for the rest of us, just to keep
things from getting too complicated." suggested Shtam.
     "Fine, fine..."  The bartender bent down behind the bar.
     Ralampago smiled at Shtam "I\'m much obliged to you all... Ah!
The old Ghost Riders!"  He indicated a model Shtelfire fighter
hanging from the ceiling.  "Alentzar fighter squadron: stationed
here during the fourth frontier war.  The old base\'s not far from
here, it\'s abandoned now."
     "Oh you know this system, mister...?" asked the bartender.
     "Ralampago." he answered, "Well not really, but my brother
told me about it:  Miguel.  Do you know him?"
     The bartender looked confused.  "Miguel..."
     "Miguel Ralampago.  Works around here as a machinist."
     "Oh yes of course!  Miguel!" he nodded smiling.
     "How\'s he doing?"
     "Just fine!  Just fine!"
     Ralampago smiled and looked back at the model.
     "Ah yes," smiled the bartender handing round the drinks.  "The
Ghost Riders!  Great bunch of folks in the old squadron. The bar is
the only thing left now.  The old base bein\' a radiation hazard...
We used to be in here every night."
     "You were here then?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     "Yes, but on the other side of the bar!  Enlisted Pilot,
Flight Sergeant Kiriat, Whezel Kiriat!  After it was all over, I
just found my way back and took over this bar!"  He gestured the
surroundings.
     "Not the friendliest place."  whispered Jietlshaiepr.  "Oh,
the locals..." breathed Whezel, "Well... they\'re not so bad,
isolated, bit xenophobic... but nothing dangerous."  He winked and
then continued aloud, "So you\'re here to see Miguel eh?"
     "Yup." smiled Ralampago, "Quick visit.  I haven\'t heard from
him in a while.  We\'re getting too far out of touch."
     "And what about the rest of you?  Relatives about?"
     "No, I\'m afraid not." answered Kfoks, "Corporation\'s got us
hunting around prospecting."
     Whezel shook his head.  "Oh, I don\'t think you\'ll have much
luck.  Not in this system.  Place is pretty well tapped out."
     "Well, that\'s what we heard, but orders are orders.  We might
find something, and that might breathe a little life around here."
     Ralampago seemed perturbed.  "Tapped out?  That\'s not what I
heard..."
     "Just a moment."  A well-tanned but stony faced woman strode
over and fixed on Kfoks.  "I\'m Jiel Kerreur, head of the
prospecting bureau.  You\'ll need to process several licenses before
you can do any prospecting and exploitation in this system."
     "Oh dear..." moaned Jietlshaiepr, and I was hoping this would
be a short survey..."
     Kfoks tail waved again, "Well, Jiel our schedule was only to
put us here for a short while, but we can stay long enough to go
through channels before we begin the survey."
     Ralampago turned to Jietlshaiepr, "Well, if you need an expert
prospector just look for Miguel, he knows this system really well."
He looked at his watch, "Well we\'ve got to go find him.  Thanks for
the drink.  You must let me return the favor soon."
     Ralampago and Gdeerzorr stood and headed for the door.
     "Good night!" called Whezel.
     Wordlessly, three of the locals got up to leave.  They took up
their laser drills and followed Ralampago and Gdeerzorr out.  With
a tinge of regret, Kfoks watched as Gdeerzorr swayed out.
     A sudden thought struck Jiel Kerreur, "Are you just
surveying?"
     Kfoks nodded slowly, "Yes, the corporation is more interested
in finding out what\'s here rather than start mining now, we don\'t
have the proper equip..."
     "We\'ll if it\'s just surveying, then you won\'t need a license.
I don\'t want to waste your time."
     Kfoks bowed and took up her hand, "Surely, you couldn\'t waste
my time with your company.  Now Jiel, will you join me?"
     Jiel Kerreur smiled and gave the handsome vargr an appraising
look through the corner of her eye.  "Sir, you have the advantage
of me..."
     "Not yet," he thought, "but soon..."
                             - IX -
     Ralampago entered the machine shop and called out cheerily,
"Miguel!?"  The bay echoed the question, reverberating off the
metal walls like the inside of a morgue.
     Light spilled softly from an office door silhouetting the
monstrous metalworking machines that loomed out of the dim light.
     Gdeerzorr sniffed the air and listened.  Burned lubricating
oil hung in the air, fresher air than the rest of the place,
obviously not as deserted as the main chamber, but no sound...
     Wait...  Not entirely silent...  There\'s someone walking
around...  Several sets of foot steps...  Hard to tell with all
this echo...
     She motioned Ralampago to silence and closed her eyes to
listen.  Her ears flicked around like dish antenna trying to get a
fix on the noises.  "They\'re getting close...  Under here!" she
whispered.  She caught his shoulder and pulled him behind a titanic
lathe.
     Under cover she pulled a snub pistol from beneath her skirt
and rammed a magazine of high explosive home.
     "Hold ON." breathed Ralampago.  "What\'s gotten..."
     "Jeff, this whole planet stinks!" she growled softly.  "We\'re
being followed, and I say we get back to the ship and blow!"
     Four figures moved across the edge of the machine bay carrying
heavy mining lasers.
                              - X -
     "Oh yes," continued Whezel Kiriat, "The mine\'s mainly had iron
ore but it wasn\'t very pure.  It\'s really a wonder they ever
started excavation.  Anyway, what was there has long been mined
out.  They try occasional exploratory blasts but they\'ve never
really found much."
     A sharp blast went off in the distance.
     A few seconds later a series rang out in an irregular
staccato.
     "There, you see?" asked Whezel.  "They blast, but nothing ever
comes of it.
     Flamboyant\'s crew exchanged worried glances.
     Kfoks turned to Jiel with his head inclined to her, "Are you
ready to go home now?"
     She looked unafraid into his eyes, "Yes, let\'s go."
                             - XI -
When you\'re close to me
I can smell you\'re in heat
I can hear you breathing in my ears

Wouldn\'t you agree,
Baby you and me
Got a vargr kind of love?
                    "Vargr Kind of Love" -- The Loonees

     Music played softly as the two figures slowly swayed in the
low light of Jiel Kerreur\'s apartment.  Taek\'s tail waving slowly
with the rhythm as they danced closely.  Jiel\'s fingers played
about his neck feeling the soft fur-covered steel of his muscles.
     Gently, with featherlike touches, she worked her way up the
back of his head to his ears, and began to lightly rub.  A growling
whimper escaped him as she worked magic on the sensitive spot.
     For a delicious moment he closed his eyes and stood there
absorbing it all.  The universe existed solely in his ears, and all
that moved was her fingertips.  His sigh seemed many kilometers
away.
     She inclined her head and pulled him to her.
     It started as a soft kiss, but Jiel would have none of that.
Taek felt a warm tongue probing at his lips and running along his
teeth.  He hesitated for a split second at this very human kiss and
opened his jaws.  Her tongue sank past his sharp canines and
tickled at his own.
     She shivered, Taek held her closer, wrapping his silk furred
arms around her and nuzzling her neck.  She wrapped her fingers
around his head and pressed him to her.  Slowly, with infinite
patience, he licked his way up her neck to her ear.
     Jiel began to moan softly at the touch of his long probing
tongue.  Her ears, while wet, felt no chill while his hot breath
warmed them, tenderly tickling the tiny hairs on the back of her
neck.
     Taek\'s muzzle was buried in her hair.  The scent of her
shampooed coiffure was delightful:  not so soulful or heartpounding
as the beautiful, crazy-making scent of a vargr woman, but with a
softer, more gentle appeal.
     She gasped as his clawed hands gently swept up her flanks
reaching for the clasps of her blouse.  Her sighs echoed in their
ears as his velvet fur tickled lightly over her bare chest.
                             - XII -
     Consciousness felt like the sharp rocks of the airless surface
ripping away at reality.  The foul stench of burned fur hung in
Gdeerzorr\'s vac suit.  The laser wound had cauterized itself
preventing too much blood loss, and the vac suit had power to run
the air scrubbers.  She could survive for a little while at least
on the surface of Zylath.
     Jeff Ralampago was dead.  All the indicators on the stolen
suit were red.  She shut down the power.  She could bury him in the
rocks, but she needed his batteries to run her own suit.
     Suddenly, she ducked behind the rocks.
     Silently, a G-Carrier was approaching over the wasteland
plain.
     She fingered the snub pistol...  four rounds armor piercing
and six rounds high explosive left...

I am interested in buying some old traveller material.  I have been looking
around and found one place that has some items, but they are giving me
the run-around on the price, ie. not giving me the price saying that they
are "very busy".  Well, this has been going on for a week, and I am getting
a bit tired of it.


So, I am interested in buying the following material.  I am not buying it
for its collectable value.  I intend to use them.  I would prefer something
that is not water damaged, but normal wear is fine.  The less the better,
for I have a level 5 in the skill: Taking Care of Books  (unfortunately,
many of my players don\'t even have this skill at 0, especially the player
who spilled coffee on my 2300AD player\'s book).

(Now, if you have Journals 1-16 and are willing to sell them at a good
price, I will go for that too, but I prefer the Best of\'s, because I just
don\'t have the room)

Supplement 13:Veterans
Exotic Atmospheres (did this see print?)

If you have the Fasa Adventures and/or the Best ofs and are willing to sell
them please respond quickly, for these are the items the "company" is
supppose to price for me.  I would love to tell them, "Sorry, but you took
so long that I bought them somewhere else"

2. Is it possible for a starship to refuel from ice? If so then any
   iceball can provide fuel, including comets and other pieces of
   junk at the fringes of a system.

3. What happens to the Megacorporations in the Rebellion? Do they
   split up? If so who gets to own them? This isn\'t a problem for the
   Vilani megacorps, but the others are diversified.

Yep.  They talk a bit about it in the Journal of the TAS issue 21 or
so in the Missiles Suppliment (I think).  I don\'t recall if they had
anything much to say except that the warheads cost something like
1MCr per kiloton yield.
(But that may be the same for fission warheads.  I may be wrong but I
think it might have been 10MCr.)

The problem with fusion warheads is that it is inconsistant with High
Guard combat.  Surely if you had warheads that could penetrate Dampers
you would use them in preference.  It would be more cost effective also
even at ten times the cost.  (When you consider how many salvoes get
wiped out by high powered nuclear dampers)

}   iceball can provide fuel, including comets and other pieces of

Yep again.  I can recall a couple of published adventures that relied
on getting fuel from frozen ice asteroids, comets, etc.  But they don\'t
actually mention all the back breaking labor necessary to get all that
ice into the tanks.  Imagine filling those huge fuel tanks with picks
and axes and shovels?  Even under micro-gravity!  :-P  And you thought
shovelling the DRIVEWAY was bad...

They cost the same as the older warheads, not ten times as much.  But
why do you assume that they are immune to nuclear dampers?  Dampers
either strengthen or weaken the strong nuclear force (depending on
whether you are in a node or anti-node, as I recall).  If you strengthen
the strong nuclear force enough, those fusion bombs should spontaneously
fuse at wherever they are (hopefully far from your ship).  If you weaken
it, they would be unable to fuse.  Either way, the damper should deal
with it.

You would use picks and shovels???  What happened to your laser cutters?
Your grav lifters?  You poor lads...

ray of propulsion" explanation!  (10 pts to whoever remembers where that
comes from!)

How Gravitics & Thrusters Really Work

        Both spaceship drives and vehicle propulsion modules work on the
same principle -- that of a gravity warp.  This is an artificially
generated gravitional field that can be used for propulsion by "gravity
planing" -- that is, changing the vector of the artificially generated
field to "play off" the local natural gravity field to obtain the
"thrust" vector desired.

        Spaceship Drives - the warp encloses the entire volume of the
ship; this has the advantage that the ship\'s mass does not affect the
size and power requirements for the maneuver drive.  It has the
disadvantage that a very strong, shielded hull is required because of
the stresses created at the boundary of the warp; for safety reasons,
the boundary of the warp must be within the thickness of the hull.  A
badly adjusted warp field, whose boundary is at or near the surface of
the hull can result in some spectacular electromagnetic effects.
(Classic UFO effects on nearby electronics).

        Vehicle Propulsion Modules - The warp encloses a small slug of
high-strength material inside the module, that is anchored to the
module.  Whatever thrust vector the "slug" has, pulls the vehicle along
with it.  Advantages: Vehicle does not require a reinforced hull; and
standard propulsion module designs have sufficient safety margins that a
badly tuned warp field will not manifest outside the module.
Disadvantages: Since the warp only encloses the slug, performance is
dependent on the vehicle\'s mass.

Fusion warheads:
       As regards nuclear dampers affecting pure fusion warheads,
it depends on how these work as opposed to fusion power plants. Such
warheads would have to be uncontrolled fusion reactors (as conventional
explosives will not be able to conceivably reach the required temperatures
and pressures). Until the reactor is actually triggered, nothing happens.
A nuclear damper stops fission warheads because it turns the unstable
heavy elements in it to lead. The fuel is zapped.

The old fuel problem now raises its ugly head - what would be used to
fuel a pure fusion weapon? What does a nuclear damper to to low-number
unstable isotopes like Deuterium and Tritium? There is no indication that
dampers have ANY effect on fuel in starships, and such warheads could use
the same fuel, even if it means a bigger weapon. If dampers could stop fusion
reactions this would have been mentioned, as it would be quite important.
(Nuclear damper spinal mounts? The mind boggles).

A possible out is that a pure fusion bomb would have to be very large, as
it would have to fuse a significant amount of fuel in it\'s brief operating
lifetime. In effect, it would be a very high-yield fusion power plant.
Such devices would have limited utility if they had to be the size of
starship power plants to have a useful yield. Difficult for point-defences
to miss :-). This would explain why they are not used. However, they would
make nice mines(one multi-gigaton bomb can spoil your whole day).

Ice refuelling:
                While going out and mining ice is perfectly possible, whether
with lasers or with axes and hard labour, there could be an easier solution.
One thing starships do not lack is power. So just radiate some heat and
melt the ice before pumping it in. A giant electric blanket could do this and
prevent the water from escaping. If the ice is on a significant body like a
planet things are even simpler - starship weaponry can melt a lot of ice,
if messily. However, Scott and Steve, your methods are much healthier from
the exercise point of view, so you can keep on digging :-).

By the way, in my part of damp, rainy Ireland fortunately snow and ice are
pretty rare. Maybe the only good thing about the weather over here.

From Armageddon:2249 (the original Buck Rogers novel)?  I\'m not sure,
but that\'s my guess.  If not, this is another early SF reference to
antigravity.

OK, Good!  Now, what about artificial gravity and intertial damping
within spacecraft?

Hey folx,

I just read through the bit in Challenge 64, on the new computer
stuff they put in there, and I thought I\'d give ya\'ll my reaction
as one of the TML\'s leading rabid and emotional technophiles.

Well, as I read it, the Imperials developed what essentually
amounts to a CPU which is far superior to all previous ones.  It
makes the synaptic units from book 8 look like low grade morons.
These things are put up as true artificial intelligence (greater
than human), which was previously only possible with massive
synaptic and parallel brains.   Sounds pretty damn neat.  I would
imagine that all the Imperial Roboticists would be screaming for a
chance to look at em.   (I can think of one in particular with a
*very* loud voice... :-)

After all, it\'s been well established that artificial intelligence
is really only possible at Tech Level 17.  (Remember Book 3: Worlds
and Adventures?  Kinunir?  101 Robots?  Book 8: Robots? etc. etc.)
So, given this little beastie\'s applications to artificial
intelligence, you\'d think it\'s first applications would be toward
robots or ship computers right?

Ok, now how Does the Imperium go ahead and use this beastie?  For
super-intelligent robots?  No...  Hyper-intelligent starship
computers for the vast hugely expensive Imperial Naval Fleets?
No...  Ok, where *DO* they get used?

Starship Transponders?  Well, Ok.  I can see they would be useful
there, but they would be VITAL elsewhere.

To paraphrase Colin:  (Re: neutrino detectors) If I were an
Imperial Admiral, that was handed a computer chip that can do all
the advertized, the last thing I would think of would be ship
transponders.

On top of that, these chips were sold to Imperial *ENEMIES*.  The
article mentions that the Sword Worlds got \'em, the Solomani?  the
Zhodani?  GEEZ!  The Imperials must be insane to sell something
THIS hot to their enemies.  Especially their competetors.  Now, Ok,
I admit the system has some fail safe devices in it to prevent
tampering, but there is NO way you could prevent the groups like
the Hivers, Solomani, Zhodani, et al from getting inside and
figuring them out.  It\'s just not possible that they could get past
everybodies science research teams.   And when the Hivers get their
tentacles on these babies...  AI Bruiser warbots?  Watch out!

I see some heavy duty changes in robotics steming from this.  Now,
Dumbots will be the exception rather than the rule.  And since the
chips are self reproducing, I expect the price of robot brains and
computers to plummet.

Now as Metlay said, this is what is called a \'retcon\', and I don\'t
particularly care for it.  It changes the whole picture of robotics
delvelopment and stuff.  Now, an AI brain ought to be of basically
negligible cost, after all, these transponders were never assigned
any price or weight or volume in a system which is so detailed we
include the price of HEADLIGHTS for heaven\'s sake.

    'body' => 'Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am concerned about the effect of GDW having full and free access
to the TML.  In my opinion, the TML is not indeed a public forum.
It is a private list by subscription only.  Perhaps someone could
correct me if I am in error, but I believe that the TML charter
says that it is indeed a private list.

I have in the past year, considered the TML as such.  I have felt
that the membership of the TML was not the public at large, but a
group of friends.  I personally consider the TML community to be
composed of my friends.  Now while I may not be friends with each
and every individual, I have talked with most of the more vocal
members, and consider them to be my friends.

There are those who have described the TML as a public forum.  I
disagree.  However, I am not about to force my definition of the
TML on anyone who feels that way.  The private/public definition is
one which is debatable.

However, I would like to make a request.

For the convenience of those who feel this to be a private list,
I would ask that those who disagree to have consideration for those
who do.  Now, if we see this as a private list, then what is said
here is said, more or less, in confidence.  Therefore, if something
is then being sent on to a third party, that is something of a
breach of trust.  The only honorable course of action is therefore
to request permission to pass letters along.  I did not think that
this was necessary before, but in view of recent events, I do see
it so now.

So, I would ask that if the TML members wish to have their comments
forwarded on to GDW via Mr. Borich, that they put a note to that
effect into the body of the letter.  If such a note does not
appear, please do not forward that particular message.

Bryan, at least in my case, I would ask you that any message from
me not go on to GDW unless I specifically ask that you do.  If in
the future, you read a message from me that you think ought to be
passed on to GDW, please ask my permission first.

If GDW wishes to interact fully with the TML, I suggest that they
subscribe to it on their own.  Thus far, I have not seen much
appreciable interest on GDW\'s part other than Loren Wiseman\'s
comments.  His comments and insights I enjoy and look forward to.

I also feel that GDW should know the following about the TML should
they decide to continue to interact.  The TML has a characteristic
frankness to it\'s discussions.  The members are free to say what
they think and contribute what they like.  Yet, there are limits to
the language used, and obscenity, while not unknown, is the
exception rather than the rule.  To be honest, I am probably one of
the worse offenders on this count, as I tend to be somewhat
emotional and quick to react at times.  I don\'t make any apologies
for it, it\'s just my personality.
(Hey, there\'s more than one reason why I sign:  \'2G Scott\' :-)

However, while the discussions are frank, personal attacks and
flames are out of place here.

GDW may feel that they have been under attack by contributors to
the TML.  This is understandable considering some of what has been
said.  I however maintain that, despite the language used, the
comments are not at a personal level, but criticism of products.
It is akin to criticizing the government:  Lots of people may say
the US president is an idiot, but that is hardly a personal attack.

Now, the US president may feel otherwise, but it is not really
meant as such.

A certain amount of frustration has been voiced over GDW and
MegaTraveller.  This has generated a good deal of the friction.
But that friction is not really on a personal level.  I therefore
suggest that GDW not treat it as such.

Also, while I do not subscribe to GEnie I understand from those who
do that there are quite some differences between that and the TML.
GEnie, has some rather strict codes, while the TML has a looser
flavor.  It is however more restrained than the USENET News groups.

If GDW thinks that the TML community is rude, then I suggest you
take a look at some of the News groups.  We\'re pretty tame.

Scott 2G Kellogg
Bryan, if you feel that GDW would be interested in the above,
please forward it to them.  Thank you.^Z

     Taek was annoyed.  The interrogation failed.  He made his way
back to the Space Winds with a bad taste in his mouth.  True, Jiel
was tasty enough, but what am I doing wandering around with all
these humans anyway?  Grah, sure, a little tumble now and then
never hurt anyone, but it seems that\'s all I\'ve had lately.
     Don\'t want to be alone...  But there\'s no one to *really* talk
to...  Gresha?  Kaezorr?  Pleasant enough, but no real... *Soul*
there.  Tuerz?  Erf.  The little psychopath is kind of light on
understanding...  Besides, he\'s... well... *almost* male anyway...
And in any case, they all look *up* to me.  Not even close to an
equal...
     The only one with the kind of *soul* I want is maybe
Jietlshaiepr.  And she\'s *human*...  Furrrr...  And even then,
she\'s got Niedrsha anyway...  Furrr....
     Taek banished such thoughts from his mind.  Then, unbidden,
Gdeerzorr\'s scent crossed his mind.
                             - XIV -
     "Whezel Kiriat runs the worst hotel in the sector."
Jietlshaiepr inspected the rented room with a wrinkled nose.  The
glassless windows were boarded up with sheet rock and wood.  An
wasteful expensive proposition on a world without trees, but it
appeared to have come from the remains of smashed wooden furniture.
The mattress reeked of must and the blankets were misted with dust.
     A small sink stood in the corner which gurgled for seven
seconds before producing a thin trickle of orange water.
     A knock at the door produced Flamboyant\'s crew, with the
exception of Kfoks, all with similar stories of their
accommodations.
     "I have an urgent report." stated Vole.
     "Yes?" Shtam leaned down next to the robotic dog.
     "I have been monitoring all the people we have encountered.
With the exception of Jeff Ralampago, Whezel Kiriat, and Jiel
Kerreur all humans have had a body temperature of three hundred and
seven point four Kelvin."
     "So what?" asked Niedrsha.
     Jietlshaiepr\'s eyebrows knitted.  "Normal body temperature is
three hundred nine...  What about Gdeerzorr?"
     "Three hundred ten point eight."
     "That\'s normal Vargr body temp." nodded Tuerz.
     "Still," Shtam interrupted, "Racial variation and genetic
drift over..."
     "No...  No... Normal temperature ranges plus or minus one
degree.  One point six is much too low...  Admittedly, there are
minor human races with lower temperatures, but that results from
major genetic engineering."
     Kfoks entered quietly, ears alert, "Well, Jiel Kerreur is
human enough..."
     Niedrsha leered and raised an eyebrow, "Oh yeah?"
     Kfoks didn\'t react, "Quite human."
     "Learn anything?"
     Kfoks shook his head, "Nothing.  She didn\'t feel like talking
much.  However, while I didn\'t learn anything, I did teach her a
few things."  Taek turned away and thought to himself, "And perhaps
I learned something about myself..."
     Vole spoke again, "I must also point out that with the
exception of Whezel Kiriat, Jeff Ralampago and Gdeerzorr, all
humans thus far encountered have produced no psionic radiations."
     "Powerful psionics," thought Shtam aloud, "Were there any
variations in strength?"
     Vole considered the question, "Very little.  Jiel Kerreur gave
an extremely small psi shadow when I was within sixty centimeters
of her.  The others gave no detectable radiation whatsoever."
     "It is also of note that all humans except the aforementioned
ranged between one point nine nine, and two point two meters tall.
This is with a measurement error of plus or minus one centimeter.
Eighty percent were measured as being exactly two point one
centimeters tall."
     "What on Zhdant is going on here?"
                             - XV -
     Jietlshaiepr woke with a start at the sound of her name.
     "Huhhummmmmmm...?  What?" she whispered in the dark.
     Vole\'s voice came out of the dark, "Miakr\'s calling from the
ship."
     "Trouble?"
     "Maybe."
     Niedrsha rolled over.  "Huuuuuunnnnnnnnngggug?  Wha\'sgoin\'on?"
     Vole\'s voice was replaced by Miakr\'s played over Vole\'s vocal
circuits.  "Jietlshaiepr?  The exterior proximity alarm woke me.
There are several guys working on the scout ship All Nighter."
     "So?"
     "I played back the sensor log, one minute there\'s no movement
out there, then the densitometer says someone just appeared inside
the ship.  The main hatch opened up, and the woman you met:  Jiel
Kerreur opened the hatch.  She\'s let several others aboard.  The
ship\'s been refueled and the engines are powering up."
     Jiet sat up, yawned and gasped for breath to feed oxygen to
her sleep soaked brain, "Any sign of Ralampago or Gdeerzorr?"
     "That\'s just it, they\'re nowhere in sight."
     "Ok.  Just hold on, I\'m going to try clairvoyance."
     Jietlshaiepr concentrated, remembering exactly where she was
in relation to the scout ship.  She began opening her mind to the
auras of things aboard the scout.  A vague picture of the bridge
built itself up...  Foggy images of the consoles came in:  no
details...  A figure in combat armor entered commands at the
terminal.
     Jietlshaiepr shook her head.  She wasn\'t seeing a true image,
it was just an educated guess.  Again she cleared her mind and
reached into space...
     Fog...
     Fog...
     "I\'m too tired to get an image." she decided.  "What\'s the
densitometer say?  Any movement?"
     Miakr\'s voice came out of the darkness, "I read four moving
bodies aboard...  with the deck plans on screen...  One on the
bridge, two in the engine room and one in fire control...  Wait...
Outside pressure dropping...  They\'re cycling the docking bay...
Hold on, now I\'m reading three on board.  Somebody just teleported
out."
     "Has the ship powered up yet?"
     "Full power.  Looks like an engine test run up...  The dock is
opening...  They\'re leaving."
     Niedrsha held one finger up in the air above the bed.  "Track
\'em.  Don let \'em get away!"  He grabbed onto Jiet\'s negligee and
pulled her gently, albeit unceremoniously, back down on the bed.
     Niedrsha\'s voice dropped an octave and growled, "Now you," He
pointed at Vole, "Shaddup."
     "You," he pointed at Jiet accusingly, but his voice softened
with a tired smile, "Hol\' still."
     He held her gently and laid his head down on her chest,
quickly finding the comfortable spot.
     "Niedrsha?" the sound of Jiet\'s whisper came strangely, his
right ear hearing it through the air, but his left was planted on
her ribcage.
     "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?"
     "I...  just used my psi..."
     "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."
     Her hand went to his chest.  "I need to be full strength..."
     Niedrsha caught up her hand as it started to roam.  "Later.
\'Kay?"
     "Okay." she nodded.
     Niedrsha smiled tiredly an nodded, his nose gently brushing
her nipple.
                             - XVI -
     Miakr shook his head.  "They flew around the planet and we
lost the densitometer image.  Then they powered down to minimum and
flew into the sun." He indicated the sensor playback.  They should
emerge right about here but they\'re just gone."
     Niedrsha banged his fist on the bulkhead.  "You\'re sure the
two crew weren\'t aboard?"
     "They weren\'t in the group that boarded the ship."
     "And you lost \'em."
     Miakr looked defensive, "Well, we know the ship\'s still in
system:  no sign of any jump activity."
     Niedrsha shook his head "What the fuck is going on?"
     Shtam studied the sensor tape "Well, it might have been a
captured ship being dropped off to a contact..."
     "Meaning Jiel Kerreur is one of them." thought Jietlshaiepr
aloud.  "But where is every body?  There ought to be a thousand
inhabitants here..."
     "It all seems pretty mysterious." agreed Shtam.
     Jietlshaiepr frowned and shook her head "Right.  This is
getting us nowhere.  We\'ve got to find the base.  Back to our
prospecting cover."
                            - XVII -
     Although we hunted high and low,
     and hunted everywhere,
     of the three men\'s fate
     we found no trace
     in any time,
     in any place:
     but a door ajar,
     and an untouched meal,
     and an over toppled chair.    -Wilfred Gibson

     Niedrsha brought the Air/Raft down to rest on the mining hut\'s
tiny landing pad.  The hut was fairly exposed:  in the center of a
large crater plain three kilometers in diameter.  The dust around
the hut was flattened with foot prints.  With no air to stir the
dust, the plain would remain trampled for eternity.
     The giant, black petaled flower of a solar array overshadowed
the small bone white hut.  The black windows stared eyelessly over
the desolate crater.  The outer hatch of the airlock stood mutely
open like the dry mouth of a corpse.
     An ATV lay jacked up on its side, where one of the road wheels
was damaged.  A tool kit lay nearby.  Exploration drilling
equipment was set up in various places.
     "Anybody home?" called Jietlshaiepr on her vac suit radio.
     Static answered.
     She scanned the desolation with binoculars while Niedrsha
climbed out SMG in hand.
     "Too quiet." he muttered.  "Like a damn crypt."
     Cautiously, they approached the hut\'s lock.  "Feel like
knocking?" asked Niedrsha.
     "Not particularly.  Let\'s go in."
     With clammy hands Niedrsha closed the outer hatch.  The
airlock controls lit up automatically.  A sudden tapping
transmitted through the floor as Jietlshaiepr hit the cycle button.
With some hesitation, the chamber filled with air.  Sensors
registered silently.
     "Breathable." mumbled Jietlshaiepr.
     Niedrsha cocked his SMG and activated its laser designator as
he undogged the inner hatch.
     The door opened on searing black heat.  A gloomy red tinge
glowed in the far corner as the tiny green spot of the helium neon
designator laser swept rapidly across the room.
     Jietlshaiepr hit the light.  Clothes lay scattered across the
floor, a tray of food sat on the table.  Niedrsha stepped inside.
     "This food\'s nearly fossilized."  a coffee mug sat nearby with
black stain in the bottom of it.
     "Somebody left the oven on." nodded Jietlshaiepr.
     They left hurriedly.
     A mining laser stood by the landing pad with tiny lights
flashing on it.  Heavy cable connected it to the solar array.
     "Looks like it\'s still running." thought Niedrsha.  He glanced
at the ground beneath it:  a neatly drilled hole... several
kilometers deep.
                            - XVIII -
     Gresha stood by over the gig\'s sensors.  The additional ones
fitted from the VIXEN provided a peculiar mix, and they were rather
dubious to start with, but they did add the comfort of a neutrino
detector and densitometer.
     Shtam cruised the gig a bare five meters over the rocky
surface.  Jutting above the plain, the shattered dome of the
abandoned fighter base hove into view.
     The base was in ruins.  Prefabricated huts dotted the dusty
surface like cracked eggs.  A large antenna tower had toppled
smashing through several huts and strewing pieces over the surface.
Laser rents in the dome wrote the story of the last battle here
twenty years ago while blast marks from shaped charges provided the
punctuation.
     "Got a radiation reading..." cautioned Gresha.  "High:  LD
ninety four outside.  Even with the hull armor, we better git and
fast!"
     "I am not anxious to get too close." announced Shtam, "Vole,
are you reading any neural activity?"
     "Nothing in my range." he answered.
     "I got some neutrino activity." declared Gresha. "Radiation\'s
getting worse.  We\'re too close!"
     "From the base?" asked Shtam, "With the high level of
radiation...  Well, anything emitting that much radiation will
effect the sensors well....  Estimated power output?"
     "Fourteen point two megawatts?  Can\'t tell, radiation\'s
playing havoc.  Levels aren\'t stable."
     "Densitometer?"
     Gresha\'s ears folded flat "Get us out of here!  It\'s LD twenty
Inside ship!"
     Shtam growled "Densitometer, *DAMMIT!*  We have to find that
fucking base!"
     Surprised by Shtam\'s sudden uncharacteristic temper, Gresha
refocused on the display, "Urr...  No movement...  Can\'t really see
much with this old thing...  Not a lot of penetration...  I just
can\'t see anything."
     "Vole," called Shtam calmly, "Anything?"
     "Negative."
     "Right.  Now, we go get some radiation serum."
                             - XIX -
     Jietlshaiepr checked the osmotic pressure injector and sent
the dose into Shtam\'s arm.  "Well son, looks like you\'ll be
alright...  Now just relax, the adrenalin in this mix will probably
blow your mind, but the sedative in it ought to knock you out for
a while.  You may want to keep an eye on your hair.  If it does go,
it\'ll grow back, but you may be a bit greyer."
     "How is Gresha doing?"
     "Not great.  High blood pressure...  Nausea...  She\'s asleep
now.  She\'s gonna be out of it for a while, but she\'ll make it Ok.
I just hope she doesn\'t lose too much fur.  I never heard of a
Vargr toupee..."
                             - XX -
     Kfoks studied the gig\'s sensor display as Tuerz flew in a low
orbit five kilometers from the airless surface of Zylath.
     "Where the fuck are they?" growled Tuerz.
     Kfoks sighed, "I still can\'t find any trace of neutrino
emission other than what we\'ve found already...  They must be using
photocells..."
     "What about the active EMS?"
     "We can pick out refined metal, it just has to be in pretty
close range.  This whole planet is made out of metal ores..."
     Kfoks squinted at the display.  "Contact."
                             - XXI -
     The mining hut stood half buried under the sand.  It\'s dark
windows looking out at the black sky while the sun beat down
mercilessly washing out all of the stars and peeling the paint off
the sides of the hut.  Sand was heaped up high over the structure
to provide extra insulation, and shade from the suns radiation.  An
ATV stood close by, parked in the open, its tracks leading off
across the desert plain.
     The whole area was beaten down with foot prints leading into
and out of the shelter, around the ATV and out into the plains.
     Kfoks and Tuerz crept up to the airlock with guns drawn.
Tuerz\'s custom laser pistol plugged into a battery back pack, while
Kfoks held his gauss rifle, glad of the weight of the fusion gun on
his back.
     Tuerz flattened himself against the bulkhead while Kfoks
reached for the hatch dogs.  Slowly, he rotated the hatch wheel.
Through the gauntlets of his battle dress he felt the vibration of
the wheel rotating.  Suddenly, the wheel jammed.
     Kfoks keyed the bone induction scrambled transmitter in his
skull "The hatch is locked."
     Tuerz eyes narrowed.  "These huts don\'t have locking hatches
on the outside.  Designed to allow emergency access to the airlock.
Jammed from inside."
     "Ok..." Kfoks slung the rifle and braced himself.  The wheel
came to the jam and the battle dress strength enhancement servos
came on.  The servos keyed up their normal power as Kfoks strained
as the dogs began to creak.  Quickly, Kfoks brought up the servos
to full power override and the wheel spun with a snap.
     The hatch swung outward and lights came on inside the airlock.
A bent and broken wrench was on the floor matching the bent and
broken wheel of the hatch\'s inner dogs.
     The indicators read that the base was pressurized and...
     Kfoks leaped out of the lock as the inner hatch wheel spun.
     The hatch crashed open crushing the inside of the airlock
propelled by nearly thirty tons of air.  A white typhoon howled out
of the lock, water vapor condensing and freezing in the vacuum.
     The radio growled, "Walk through that lock and you\'re dead."
     From cover, Kfoks focused the fusion gun on the airlock.
Nothing moved inside the black cavern of the mining hut.
     Tuerz hackles rose inside his armor.  "Blast a hole in the
side of the hut, fire a few shots in, and then rush the airlock!"
     "Wait, hold on..." Kfoks peered at the open hatch way.  A
black hole against a glaring back ground.  One step into the door
and you\'d be silhouetted.
     A radio aerial stood on top of the hut.  Kfoks ripped it off
with a blast of the fusion gun.
     "All right in there." growled Kfoks over the radio.  "Your
radio is down.  There\'ll be no calling to your friends.  Come on
out with your hands up."
     "Give up?" strained the growing voice, "I\'ve killed too many
of you grsharrks to be afraid of you.  Come on.  Put your teeth
where your tongue is."
     "Gveg?" wondered Kfoks.  "Gdeerzorr is that you?"
     "What do you think?  Now keep back!"
     Kfoks switched languages, much better to talk in one\'s native
tongue.  "This is Kfoks of the Miscat Zhje Gorrne.  We moored along
side your ship.  We were both at that stupid bar."
     "What...?" confusion and fatigue sounded in her voice.  "Drop
yer weapons and come inside..."
     Kfoks thought for a moment.  Battle dress couldn\'t conceal his
weapons, but by itself was weapon enough.  He disconnected the
fusion gun and laid the gauss rifle aside.
     Once inside the battle dress lit the interior with active
infrared.  Gdeerzorr lay on the floor with a gauss rifle leveled on
him.  Her vac suit was seared with burn marks and covered with suit
patches.  Detonator wires lay at her side leading to the airlock.
     "So you\'re one of them." she growled weakly.
     "One of who?"
     "Them!"
     "Who the hell are they?" growled Kfoks.
     "How the fuck should I know?" she shot back.
     "Look we came here to do a mining survey..."
     "With battle... dress and... fusion guns?" Gdeerzorr\'s voice
was getting weaker.
     Kfoks tensed invisibly, "Who attacked you?"
     "Don\'t know...  They just...  We tried to find... Jeff\'s
brother.  They followed... fired, and we... got out..." Gdeerzorr
was fading fast.
     In a blur, Kfoks was at her side examining the vac suit\'s
readouts.  Pressure low, high carbon dioxide, obvious heavy wounds
under the suit patches, made untouchable inside the sealed vac
suit.  "Tuerz get in here, fast."
     "...Find brother..." She slumped.
     Tuerz appeared.  His gun surveyed the room.
     Kfoks positioned himself to lift her.  "Support her legs.
Gotta keep her immobile.  We\'ll move her to the gig."
     "We should secure her limbs to prevent compli..."
     "No time.  Suit\'s down to zero."
                            - XXII -
     Once in the gig Tuerz cut Gdeerzorr out of the suit.  He made
a quick examination and put her in the emergency low berth.  Her
heart stopped fourteen seconds before she went into the deep
freeze.
     "That\'s gonna be one hell of a hospital bill." sighed Tuerz.
"Third degree burns...  looks like some small shrapnel in the
chest...  I\'m not sure but I think she\'s got an unexploded HE round
in the lower abdomen."
     "Handle with care." thought Kfoks aloud.
     "She can\'t sit with that in there.  It\'s gonna have to come
out."
     "Can you do it?"
     "No.  She\'s dead.  To get it out we\'ll have to raise the
temperature and that\'ll blow any chance of reviving her without
proper facilities."
     "Then she\'ll just have to sit in cold storage till we find a
good enough hospital."
     "With a bomb inside her?" Tuerz ears flattened, "That\'s crazy!
I say we dump her."
     Kfoks fixed Tuerz eye, "*No*."
                            - XXIII -
     "This is stupid!" sighed Jietlshaiepr.  "Why did they attack
those two?  They weren\'t a threat!"
     Kfoks thumbed through Gdeerzorr\'s wallet.  "Nothing makes
sense around here.  Tuerz went back in the air/raft to see if he
could find anything more."
     "Damn right, but where do we go from here?" asked Niedrsha.
     "Any suggestions?" asked Jietlshaiepr.
     "Mmmm." Kfoks produced a photograph out of the wallet.
     Jietlshaiepr took the picture, a short, dark, balding man aged
about forty. "Miguel Ralampago...  I think it\'s time we paid a
visit to the next of kin."
                            - XXIV -
     The tall dark man answered, "Oh, I\'m afraid my brother\'s left
system.  Tight schedule he\'s got you see, I gather he had to make
a payment on his ship.  I think he\'s behind on them, but he\'s too
embarrassed to tell me."
     "So much for the drinks." sighed Jietlshaiepr, "Thanks
anyway."
     After they had walked a fair distance Niedrsha breathed
quietly, "Why the fuck would somebody impersonate a simple
machinist?"
                             - XXV -
     Kfoks strolled calmly into the Zylath Solarium.  Sunlight
streamed through the huge glass dome overhead blotting out the
dimmer stars in the stellar panorama.  Chairs, tables and umbrellas
testified to the desire of humans to lie under a sun whither or not
it was a real beach or not.
     Jiel Kerreur lay basking on her stomach, paging though a
magazine.  The snow white bikini she wore accentuated her deep
bronze tan.
     "You must be the toast of Zylath." announced Kfoks.  Then he
thought to himself, "No wonder she popped up golden brown
before..."
     "Hello Taek." she smiled seductively.  Jiel tossed her hair
over her shoulder and cocked her head.  "Is there something I can
do for you?"  She rolled onto her back and smiled impishly.
     "Why yes, there is..."  Kfoks sat down beside her and stroked
his hand across her stomach and up to her full breasts.  Softly, he
hooked a finger around the strap of her bikini top as she stretched
to kiss him.  "There\'s something I\'d like you to get off your
chest..."
     With a quick twist, the brassiere was around her throat as he
garroted her.  "...What exactly is going on here?"
     Jiel\'s eyes bulged as her mouth opened soundlessly.
     "Speak up dear, I can\'t hear you."
     He was cut short by the butt of a gauss pistol on the back of
his skull.
                            - XXVI -
     Rackan\'s cabin was deserted.  A half empty drink stood by the
bunk and the sheets were mussed up.  No sign of struggle, just an
empty room.
     Niedrsha stepped into the room surveying it at a glance.  "I
checked Kaezorr\'s cabin:  gone."
     "Struggle?" demanded Jietlshaiepr.
     "None."
     Jietlshaiepr shook her head, "But what...  Oh shit!"  She
turned and ran for the ladder.  Sick bay was on the upper deck with
two patients....
     Sick bay empty.
     Shtam and Gresha gone.
     Jietlshaiepr hit the intercom.  "We\'ve got problems folks."
She surveyed her ward.  At least, here she\'d notice what was out of
place.
     Patients gone...  Instruments still in place...  Both I.V.\'s
gone...  diagnostic records gone...  Holo-computer link metabolic
monitors disconnected and thrown aside...
     Somebody was in a hurry.  Teleports... must be.
     But they took them alive...
     The ward blurred quickly and disappeared.  The cold metal of
her battle dress replaced the soft film of her dress.  She nudged
the power switch with her chin and the armor came to life.  Sensors
came on line and the dim ship\'s locker came alive through the holo
projecting heads up display of the armor.
     The fusion gun came on line and began to suck power from its
personal cauldron of fire in the fusion back pack.
     Quickly, Jietlshaiepr switched the power leads to a plasma
gun.  The fusion gun would rip through a bulkhead.  If possible,
she\'d rather keep Flamboyant in one piece.
     Niedrsha and Miakr sat on the floor strapping on the leg armor
to their battle dress as Jietlshaiepr emerged from the armor locker
growling, "Get your ass in gear, they..."
     A grenade flew down the corridor.
     Instinctively, she jumped and kicked it back to its sender.
Combat armor, Zhodani, tech level twelve, registered instantly in
her mind.  Her arm came up wielding the plasma gun.
     The grenade detonated back by it\'s thrower spewing light green
tranq over the passage way.  Her finger burned on the trigger of
the plasma gun but Niedrsha was just too close and not fully in
armor.  The armored figure dove for cover as Jietlshaiepr drew her
gauss pistol and sprayed the corridor.
     Vole leaped down the corridor in hot pursuit in long bounds
with legs driving like pistons, his laser designator fixed on the
spot where the figure disappeared.  Suddenly, in mid leap he
stopped and fell to the ground.  His heavy metal bulk fell to the
ground in a lifeless frozen statue.
     Miakr screamed as a section of his mind shut down, half of his
senses went out like a light switch.
     Two grenades came skittering down the passage and splashed
green tranq over Jietlshaiepr\'s armor.
     Miakr\'s eyes filled with tears as the DMSO and tranquilizer
stung his face and then it suddenly went numb.
     Niedrsha felt it hit his sleeves and slowly soak through the
material to touch his unprotected skin.  Grabbing his gauss rifle
he rolled and fired a grenade down the passage as the muscles in
his arms went limp.  The grenade bounced off the wall as the rocket
charge propelled it onward, bouncing off the walls like a pinball.
A second later his vision was gone as blackness enveloped him.
     Jietlshaiepr cursed as she ducked from the blast that shredded
the crew lounge.  A second later she teleported into the lounge
with the gauss pistol barking to enforce the shock.
     The quarry was gone.
     Teleported to where they could...
     She glanced back up the corridor to where she\'d been.
Niedrsha and Miakr down.  Two bastards in combat armor.
     Suddenly, she was behind one of them.  Her fist, clad in a
bonded superdense gauntlet, crashed through the helmet scattering
brains over the walls and floor.  Her gauss pistol coughed spraying
needles into the chest of the second.
     Gauss needles splattered around the room deflected by the
contours of the combat armor as the wearer was thrown back by the
impact.  It brought up a combat rifle firing on automatic.
Discarding sabot ripped her armor, buckling and tearing the metal
on her right arm and chest and shredding the flesh beneath while
slimy green tranq ended the burst with a sticky sickening thump.
     Tranquilizer blocked the pain of the ripped flesh.  As
blackness enfolded her brain she fought to focus her mind for
psionic regeneration.

I think it came from the "Mars" novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, although I\'m
not certain that I\'m correct. The ray in the "Mars" novels (whatever it was
called) was pretty odd--sort of like helium or hydrogen, really. Airships had
tanks full of the stuff, and this kept them aloft. When somebody shot a hole
in the tank (happened all the time), the ships would lose altitude.

The ray used in _Armageddo 2249_ wasn\'t exactly antigravIt was more like
a pressor beam. Craft used several beam projectors, which acted somewhat like
stilts--the ships "walked" on top of the beams. Ships could be brought down
by firing explosive rockets into the beams, which upset the ship andde it
crash.

Tom suggests a giant electric blanket or just a warm starship hull

fine, as long as you\'ve got a planet with an atmosphere, to work
on but it\'s not really applicable to work in asteroids.  (No gravity,
no atmosphere)

Steve was talking about using laser cutters, and grav lifters to mine
ice.  Well, ice, being transparent is probably not quite so easy to
melt with lasers, but not certainly not impossible.  However, grav
lifters, and mining equipment cost money.  They certainly aren\'t
standard equipment aboard any starship *I\'ve* ever let my players
aquire.  After all, mining ice is certainly not the easiest way of
fueling up, and is kind of a last resort in my book.  Anyone who doesn\'t
have the equipment is going to have to think twice about going into a
system where the only fuel source is ice...

I can think of all sorts of nasty mishaps for unprepared players... |->

They didn\'t support Traveller, Nor Megatraveller, now they are going
to make it a spin off of their TW:2000 system. (Which got many of
its rules from modifications to traveller). I\'ll believe the support
when I see it. I always thought that DGP provided good and interesting
background material, (as did Paranoia press, and Gamelords, etc) now
they are part of the unoffical group... Support of third party
products is part of the support of the product line as well...

What? Think in terms of a different set of rules?? Most of the work for
a module is in the story line, and fitting into the background and mood
of the game system (one would hope). The work to construct the correct
tasks shouldn\'t be all that difficult, or those people who know the
old system are going to be under a lot of duress in the switch to TNE.
I can however see this point for producing new rules supplements, ship
designs, etc...

Sure like putting stutterwarp in Traveller, or perhaps the dark

Despite Metlay\'s comments I agree with this, if you consider all the
development time in the cost of the first issue of a game, then it is
not going to make much money (if any). However the latter releases are
almost pure profit, as is a lot of work on the supplments that are planned
during this time. It all depends on how you do the bookwork. And yes it
is okay, really!, to make money when you do something...

I agree that more frontiers were needed, and I also agreee that the
rebellion was a bad idea... Though there was the Leviathan Module which
was about exploration. With just a little manipulation they could have
maintained that as the "Frontier"...

I can\'t see players intimidated by background information. The GM
perhaps, or players initmidated by huge amounts of rules. But there
are many other games, such as AD&D that seem to thrive with, well
I\'ve lost count, but at least 3 complete worlds, plus umpteen rule
books (in their new simplified third edition...)

This is one of the best things that they have thought up. Instead of
people having to pretend that they didn\'t know the old rules, you can
have them be a part of the "Aliens" phenomenon. Not only that when
the old players are unfamiliar with how the new rules work, you can
pass them off as being not familiar with the new technology.
"We\'ll be safe in this cave 1.1km below the surface, densitometers
only work to one 1km..."Just to find out that that part of the rules
have been altered, as the enemy beams in, err digs them out...

A good thought. I for one have always liked the near-technology feel
of the 2300 rules. Sometimes the traveller technology can give a player
a feeling of detachment, as the entire lifestyle can be radically
different from our own.

I really have my reservations about this. The ship design rules in the
orignal set were not fussy, but I had a lot of problems with the discrete
values that had to occur to get that level of simpleness. (Actually I
consider the current design rules too simple. Ow. OW! Stop throwing things.)

The orignal reason that the systems were different was that ground combat
occured over such a small time scale that a ships maneouvering attempts
would be irrelevant  if the same rate of fire was used in starship combat.
So they made the ship combat occur over a longer time scale (10 or 15
minutes instead of 10 seconds if I recall the facts...)

Presumably one would choose which one you wanted to use. As has
been mentioned elsewhere, stutterwarp and jump drive are not compatable
when it comes to combat. Unless, however, they alter the speeds of
in-system maneuvering. If one could get a good fraction of C out of ones
maneuver drives, then the jump ship might have the edge, as it could
simply jump away if it gets too damaged...

Any combat with more than three ships (two really) requires either a
3-D combat system or idiots for ship captains. I doubt that they will
do this, for the same reason that the universe is flat (or nearly so,
nearly flat can be explained by the current maps). That reason is
complexity. People (myself included) have difficulty imagining a complex
3D situation when only 2D is present.

I have used this before in the past. Letting pirates (Har!) or other
disreputable types (like Megacorps) set up bases in uninhabited and
uncharted systems in the "empty" hexes on the map.

I have a big problem with the other races being at all affected by
any form of computer probelms. Okay perhaps the Solomani, as they would
have quite similar systems to the Imperium. Maybe the Aslan, Vargr. But
why on Earth (or off it) would the K\'kree, or Hivers have anything even
remotely similar that could be affected in any manner by a plague/Virus
starting in the Imperium???

Are the characters to be these so called Star Vikings? I am not certain
of their place in the cosmos. Perhaps they are the new bad guys?
As for boarding actions, I can see them, if you had a fast enough craft
to close to zero range (and find a spot where no weapons could be
pointed at you to dock to). Or perhaps the Vikings will have a special
Viking power to use aginst the ships, put them in statis or something,
but have to board in order to actually take control of the ship...

BZZT. Thanks for playing. I like the Domain and I too would like to
see it remain for sentimental purposes. But I can\'t see the Virus
taking out the Imperium, Aslan and Vargr without affecting the Domain.
By doing this they have already broken their own rule about exceptions,
I\'d like to see how they come up with the reason that a group of
planets using the exact same technology is spared while ones using
radically different ones are not...

Yea! I\'ve always liked the Zhodani. But I am feeling cheated that we
won\'t see anything about the core expeditions (Talk about good frontier
actions), and the threat from the core. Lots of good plot threads there
that they are passing up..

I don\'t think I need to add anything here. I don\'t like the term
Virus, I don\'t like the concept... If it is just a plot device, why
not have some sort of opponent that at least requires some form
of physical contact. Nanomachines, or some sort of AI lifeform that
takes over ships, etc.. Otherwise no communication should or could
exist in the new universe. Open channels to the vampire ship, and
suddenly you ship is not yours anymore. I shudder to think of what
a hacker that thought 10,000x faster than I could could do. And there
would be no way to stop it, short of Isolation.

I seem to remember that after the people at GDW had released 2300AD and
set up a background of many decades of their use, the players managed to
come up with some new twists to their use. (I think the tug actions).
This shows that one cannot always catch on to the uses of a new technology
introduced into the game system. This is one of the reason\'s I think
that GDW doesn\'t want to get into the details of the various technologies,
as they can more easily plug any holes in the system if there is not
a concrete logical explanation for everything.

> STUTTERWARP & TRAVELLER
As other people mentioned retrofitting Stutterwarp is a bad idea.
I might buy someone discovering it now that J-Drives may not be
availble on certain planets, or maybe if the rules were changed that
it wasn\'t found feasable, or maybe even outlawed due to extreme health
hazards...

Ooh. 6 whole months. I doesn\'t sound like they have gotten very far on
the rules if they are still hashing out major componets like what types
of drives to use. Perhaps they can protoype it faster than normal as
they have the system already developed, but that isn\'t a lot of time
for playtesting, even if they had it available today...

Having watched \'the ball\' pong back and forth a bit over
TNE, I\'d like to add my comments.

	To me, the virus is looking less and less believable
after having read the Challenge:64 description and thought
about it some.  Not for how it works: looking at the details,
I can see how it could happen.  ("Daylight come..." indeed 8-).
My problem is in believing that it hadn\'t happened earlier.

	To massively summarize, the premise is that the Imperials
were using the Cymbeline silicon life chips as Transponder components
and (Lucan?) builds a virus from one of the Cymbeline predators.
That\'s all fine and good, but it requires a suspention of disbelief
that all n-billion starship designers and crew didn\'t know what was
being built into their starship (_nobody ever successfully pried a
transponder open and looked inside?  gimme a break...) and didn\'t
notice as the transponders "chatted" back and forth all the time
between ships.  Any military organization that didn\'t notice this
would be neglegent beyond belief and quite a few groups of characters
in campaigns I\'ve been in would have noticed the chitchat of transponder
traffic and taken a closer look.  It won\'t fly, even ignoring the
fact that the presumption is that the only application of these
little gems was in transponders (I can think of a few million other
uses for them, myself, and I\'m sure someone else would have too...).

	Given as how it\'s set in stone by now, however, that\'s sort
of a moot point (oh, shoot the Moot while we\'re at it).  Moving right along,
I\'m just going to keep writing adventures and such.  I figure it can\'t
do too much damage. (heh).  Good backgrounds always are worth working
with, no matter what the rules are.  I figure that TNE is going to
be a background worth writing in.  After all, MT was... 8-)


	And on to point two-oh;

	Every month, GDW puts out a Challenge with +- (argument\'s sake)
15,000 words of Traveller material.  A rough approxomation of TML
traffic is more like 50kwords, at least 15kwords of which is non-story
or PBEM related.  I.e. we\'re doing more talking about Traveller than
they are publishing by a large amount.
	How come it is, then, that with dozens of great posts, rules,
and ideas bobbing around the group here, there are only a handful
of us getting published?  Looking around, I strongly suspect that
there\'s more talent here than anywhere else in one grouping
(not impugning the GDW staff or HIWG, but there are a lot\'o people
on TML... 8-) .  So how come nobody here writing stuff and sending
it to GDW?  While we\'re here fuming about GDW ignoring or disliking
the TML list or its people, they\'re sitting there going "Gee, we\'ve
got this loud crowd of people that complain and argue a lot and never
submit us anything." ...

	WRITE IT UP AND SEND IT IN!  If you don\'t think you can write well,
bounce it off one of the better writers here for editorial comments
or help.  (I volounteer if need be 8-).  You\'re energetic enough to
argue about it for days; why not just write it up and see if GDW buys it?

Ice isn\'t really very transparent unless it is really pure H2O.  Which
cometary ice probably isn\'t.  And, while grav lifters cost money, most
merchant ships have them to offload the cargo.  And lasers are pretty
common where we come from:  welders, ship\'s weaponry, etc.

And I can\'t recall the last time someone tried to refuel anywhere but
a starport in our campaign.  But I also can\'t remember seeing a ship
bigger than a scout that DIDN\'T have laser-cutters and grav lifters
on board.  And the scouts have air-rafts, which will do as a grav-lifter
in a pinch.

It would have quite a lot of problems, IF it did something so silly as
to fly through such.  Since a stutterwarp ship normally fights at ranges
of several to many light seconds, the odds of it passing through a sand
cloud are about zero, unless the Captain is a suicidal idiot.  Normally,
such a ship will stay a couple of hours at six-Gs away from you, and
your sand won\'t do anything, except obscure your vision.

Odd question of the day:
Does anyone else see a parallel between Old Man Oberlindes and
H. Ross Perot?  I just started reading \'On the Wings Of Eagles\'
and I am wondering if it inspired the old rescue of Sergi
Oberlindes on Ruie.  I may be wrong about the dates, but it
seems to me that old amber zone was written about the same
time as it occured.

The two seem to have similar backgrounds, attitudes and
inclinations.

So, I wonder what Oberlindes is supposed to be doing in the
rebellion....  Running for Arch-Duke?  :-)

Hmmm, well, you have a point.  However, I see a problem:

A great deal of what appears here as \'original material\' ie. the stories,
vehicles, and ideas posted, etc, do fall under the definition (as I
understand it) of what GDW claims as it\'s intellectual property.  If
someone has a story which is not totally original, (if it uses the
Traveller background) then writing it to a public medium may constitute
plagurism.  Now, I\'m really not up to snuff on the legality of such
things.  However, I don\'t think I can continue to write stories where
the inspiration is so obvious to all concerned.

I have always been of the opinion that The 4.5th Frontier War was
unpublishable, as it draws background, inspiration, situations, and even
characters lock stock and barrel from other stories.  If posting it here
on the TML constitutes publishing it in a public medium, I may indeed
have broken some law.  Or if I haven\'t, I\'ll betcha a lawyer could at
least make a case that I had done so.

I therefore consider all vehicles, stories, and other original work of
mine (or anyone elses) which appear here to be private in nature.  By
that definition, we may continue to write \'original traveller\' material.
If the TML is indeed a public medium, I don\'t know if we can do that and
post it here.  True, it is doubtful that any of us would actually be the
subject of a lawsuit, as no money ever changes hands, but it may be
illegal in principle.  (I think...  I really don\'t know...)

Hey, every RPG publisher encourages the writing of modules for their games.
What they do object to is the _selling_ of the modules.  When you start taking
money out of their pocket, that\'s when they get pissed (and rightly so for the
most part.)  Any story or ship design or world design or computer program
published in the TML gets no monetary reimbursement.  The stuff is original.
GDW isn\'t losing a dime!  However, if you were to start transcribing a
previously published module or story, that\'s another matter entirely.  From
my understanding of copyright law, GDW would need to show some sort of
damage inflicted upon them.  There is no damage (other than what they do
to themselves.)  I think we are all safe in the way the TML has been

It is good to bring this up periodically, though.

Fusion warheads sound interesting and plausible.

The discussion on this implied the need for a FISSION reaction to get the
FUSION reaction going and that using a standard FUSION power plant from a

Staship FUSION plants include all sorts of safe-guards and monitors and
consoles and shielding and spare parts and service facilities to operate and
that chews up a lot of the size and cost.

What if the missile contained the bare essentials to maintain a FUSION
reaction for a minimal amount of time (time to get to a target) and then
critical OR if it met the target earlier then it could voluntarily go
critical.

The missile in this case would be much smaller (approaching normal size) and
would need to be "ignited" just prior to launch.  This could be done by
"squirting" some "FUSION" from your starship\'s FUSION plant into the missile
just before launching it.  Please don\'t yell at me.  I\'m not a nuclear
scientist and don\'t know how you would do these things in reality so I put
them in double quotes.

Is this feasible?

Now onto my main topic...  NUCLEAR DAMPERS.

Is this a field effect?  If so then how do you prevent it from damping your
own starship powerplant and all your own missiles?

If its a projector of some sort then why can\'t it be used as a weapon to
stop starships dead in space?

What sort of range does it have?

Is there a definitive description of this magical device somewhere?

Are nuclear dampers just magical devices dreamed up by GDW (like MESON guns)
or is there a remote possibility that we could produce one in a few
thousand years or so?

Oh I\'m full of questions today.  Aren\'t I?

Traveller stuff into my briefcase when I went, and had time to work on it
a bit.

Now, the unusual part of it is that I didn\'t take MegaTraveller and I didn\'t
do vehicles: I took my copy of Starter Traveller, and I started trying to
detail a randomly geenrated subsector that I came up with when I bought that
set of rules in 1990.

What I would like to do is upload the information in batches, and ask for
everyone\'s opinions on how to go about squeezing some interesting adventures
out of this particular subsector.  Sort of an exercise in GMing.

With any luck, I\'ll have the basic rolled planet data typed in sometime today
or tomorrow.  I should mention that I bought the copy of Starter Traveller
and rolled the subsector while I was at the Viola da Gamba Society of
America\'s annual convention, so the planet names have a rather odd topical
consistency.

A Copyright is just that; a COPY - RIGHT; a right to say who can or cannot copy
your work, and/or make money doing so.

This \'intellectual property\' stuff is BS.  It doesn\'t matter if I make a
million dollars writing stories, scenarios, third party rules, or GMing.  GDW
can touch you *as* *long* *as* *you* *do* *not* *copy* *their* *material*!

Now it may be difficult to literally never copy any of their material;  It will
be hard to write a scenario without refering to the rules in some fashion.
What you have to do is either refer to it in an original way, or simply refer
your reader to the original rules which they would have to buy from GDW, which
*should* make GDW happy.

For instance, I can write an article about the inconsistancies of T2000 and MT
ship design, and how the published ship designs don\'t make any sense, and don\'t
follow the rules.  I can even publish my own designs, and talk about why I
think my designs are better and how they are different.  BUT, I can\'t copy and
publish GDW\'s ship designs or ship design rules.  Therefore, any reader has to
have read and presumably bought GDW\'s rules and designs in order to really
understand the article.

I have to say that actually I don\'t really know whether if I made a business
out of publishing gaming material based on GDW\'s Traveller, whether I would
need  some sort of license agreement to make unavoidable duplication of GDW\'s
work.  Part of such an agreement might be to make your work \'officially
accepted\'.  Did Paranoia Press et al have licensing agreements with GDW?

But anyway the current brew-ha-ha is rediculous.  This is as bad as being sold
a live role playing rule book, and then being told that I couldn\'t run my own
games based on those rules.  I laughed in their face.  I bought the right to
use the book in any way I choose, except I can\'t copy it, barring any specific
restrictions in the copyright notice in the book.

Can you imagine TSR or some such telling you that every one of your D&D games
has to be sanctioned by TSR, and you have to pay them money for each session!
Hah!  But that is where any idiot sniveling about \'intellectual property\' is
headed.  IF GDW, or any other company wants to make money, they have to sell
products people can and will use as they see fit.  If anyone tells me I can\'t
develop my own rules, designs, modifications or what have you, they are cutting
their own throat.

Oh, and... watch out for the Games Police (tm)... :->

If drawing inspiration, situations, background, etc. from a variety of
situations made something unpublishable, then I wonder how many books
are "unpublishable." Particularly in some genres of writing, there can
be substantial borrowing (you just can\'t make things too similar...)...

Whether the TML is public or private in a legal sense is a very good
question. As a limited subscriber list (albeit one that anyone can

comparison to other "media."

Hey, don\'t look at me, I\'m still only a law student! :->

Seriously, you are asking at what point the line is crossed between
copyrightable material and copyright infringement, and while I don\'t
have the answer, I would be interested in knowing that as well.

Personally, I\'d continue on with current practice. If GDW sat on their
"rights" then they have no cause to complain, and if they try to enforce
their "rights" they\'re probably wasting money. At least you could always
use the "pure heart, empty head" defense. :->

As I mentioned before, the Gama Subsector was created while I was at the Viola
da  Gamba  Society of America\'s annual convention in 1990.  I  dusted  it  off
recently  when  the  discussion of TNE started to bore me, as  a  change  from
designing vehicles.  (Seriously--I\'e got enough of them now that I don\'t  feel
a  real need to do any more any time real soon...)  The problems  involved  in
GMing any subsector seem to me to be about the same, whether the subsector  is
from a published source, or randomly rolled, and whether the rules are Classic
Traveller or MegaTraveller (or TNE?).

I\'m very much interested in adventure ideas which the subsector and its worlds
suggest to you, and anyone who can create and upload a computer  transmittable
_map_  would receive my gratitude, as having a map in front of you might  make
this discussion easier.

Anyway, here are the worlds of:

Interesting Facts:

The highest technology level is E (14) at Galliard and Pardessus.
The highest population level is A at Susato.
The only industrial world is Madrigal, at TL6.
The three high population worlds have TLs of 6, 5, and 9 respectively,
   and starport types of B, E, and E respectively.
There are two balkanized planets, Agricola and Canzona.
Only one system (Lawes) has no gas giant.

Early assumptions made:

The  subsector capital was placed at Lassus, with a TL of 13, a class A  star-
port, and a central location.

The  worlds are distibuted in the form of a "main" of sorts at the right  hand
side of the subsector, three clusters of worlds at the bottom, and an isolated
world, a cluster of two, and a cluster of three worlds at the top.

Placing IISS X-boat routes to connect class A starports, naval bases, and  the
capital,  I drew links between Galliard, Forqueray, Lassus, Baldwyn  and  then
off the map to the right.

The  assumption  of native populations was made to account for  the  two  high
population  worlds  with class E startports and relatively  low  tech  levels.
Susato was chosen as the home of a minor human race, since we know that  there
are 40-odd of them, and only a few have ever been described, and Agricola  was
chosen  as  the home of a race of aliens, since I didn\'t think that  the  100%
water surface was conducive to a large human population.

If you use the Classic Traveller description of class A starports as the  only
facilities  containing ship yards, and the shipyard capacities  from  Trillion
Credit  Squadron, you reach the conclusion that there are only four  potential
commercial shipbuilding sites in the subsector, at Galliard (TL14),  Pardessus
(TL14),  Forqueray (TL11) and Lassus (TL13).  The total "drydock" capacity  of
these four sites is 150 tons, 150 tons, 150 tons, and 1200 tons  respectively.
So, only Lassus can build anything bigger than a Scout ship.  It is my  inten-
tion to stick to Book 2 starship designs for this exercise, which makes things
a little easier overall, since Jump limits are based on hull size rather  than
tech level.

Assuming  a  reasonable ship life, and a need to perform maintenance  for  two
weeks  out  of  each year, we find that Lassus can support a  total  fleet  of
shipping,  military  and civilian, totalling around 19,000  tons.   Ships  are
either going to come from beyond the subsector, or be fairly scarce, or  both.
I don\'t know that this would work, so I have designated Weelkes as a potential
ship  source.   Weelkes would have a shipyard capacity of  120,000  tons,  and
would be rated as an industrial planet if its population was 9 instead of 8.

Adventure Potential:

Psionics  Institutes were rolled for, and none appeared.  This can  always  be
altered later if necessary.

With only one industrial planet, and that at TL6, high tech "goodies" are also
going to be expensive, hard to maintain, and hard to replace.  Just  something
to keep in mind...

With  most  of  the  planets  (24 out of 32) having  a  trade  code  of  "Non-
industrial",  merchant characters with ships are going to be hard  pressed  to
make a living in speculative trade, especially if we elect to use the Merchant
Prince trade system (i.e., the MegaTraveller trade system.)

Balkanized  worlds  prevent some of the best opportunities for  espionage  and
military  adventure, in my opinion, and there are only two in  the  subsector.
One  of  them is the world I already designated as the home of a  minor  alien
race,  making  it potentially difficult for players to  become  interested  in
their politics, depending on how alien they get to be...

There are no inhabited asteroid belt mainworlds, but that doesn\'t mean that  a
belt can\'t be added to a system if it would be interesting.

So, does anyone have any ideas yet?

I looked at this subsector for quite a while and was unsure of what I would do
with it.  A lot of the worlds look pretty useless, and I can\'t imagine at  the
moment why some of them were inhabited at all.  The generally low  populations
lead  me  to decide that the subsector is fairly "young" as these  things  go,
which gives me some notion of how to start thinking about the worlds.

In  the  next installment, I\'ll discuss the brief world  descriptions  that  I
wrote up for each of the 32 worlds, and then ask if these seem reasonable.

Then some ideas:

Hex#  Name          UPP        Bases    Trade     GG?
- - ----
0102  Violone       C778867-3  S                   Y

T-prime planet with viable population, yet pre-industrial tech.
Perhaps a regressed colony rediscovered by Scouts and put under
surveillance and protection. This jibes with the Scout base.
No interdict. Propably recently lifted, perhaps when TL became
3. Limited trade and contact permitted by the Scouts, but there
are restrictions on what kind of tech you can import.

0103  Vielle        E322335-8           NI, P      Y

Small non-viable population on undesirable world. Either a
mining outpost or a dirt-poor, struggling colony of pilgrims
(religious or political).

0105  Fantasia      A99A522-8           NI         Y

Large waterworld with either large colony or small independent
population. Could be a co-op seaharverster outfit.

0106  Galliard      A100505-E  N        NI         Y

Really undesirable dirtball with large colony/small independent
population and a Naval Base. No government, moderate law. I think
most if not all of population employed at naval base. Shipyards are
propably larger than population indicates. Try adding Imperial taxes
of all Imperial worlds in sub-sector and figure out how many tons of
warship that would buy. This shipyard should be able to maintain at
least that many Naval ships. The base propably guards the Imperium
from hostiles to the left (sorry, spinward).

0109  Motet         C898735-3           AG         Y

Another large population with low tech. Maybe another regressed
colony (so why no Scout base? (Add one?)).

0110  MADRIGAL      B7989DE-6  S        IND        Y

Another regressed colony, but one that has been open for some time.
(If Imperial presense is fairly new then a population level of 9 is
propably due to locals rather than immigrants).
Who is paying for the Class B Starport? The tech level is too low
to support starships, so someone is importing the technicians and
parts to keep it going. The local government? An independent
starport corporation? A subsector-wide trading company? A trade
conglomorate? Starport can be whatever size you want; it dosen\'t
necessarily serve the whole planetary population.

0205  Ricercar      X67759B-3           NI, AG     Y

Prison planet (run by who?) with artificially restricted technology.
Population is forced to sell agricultural products to home planet
for low prices.

0206  Pavane        C84379A-4  S        P          Y

Mainworld, regressed colony (There\'s a lot of them, isn\'t there?
Possibly there once was a small interstellar community that had
a bad case of civil war).

0210  Canzona       C765673-3           NI, AG, R  Y

Another regressed colony (but where\'s the Scout base?)

0301  Treble        D655242-4  S        NI         Y

Outpost of some kind (But why the low TL? Outposts are usually
placed by starfaring people. Can\'t use the Prison Planet again).

0302  Tenor         E446411-6           NI         Y

Struggling colony.

0308  Haydn         D455273-8           NI         Y

Outpost.

0309  Bach          C525442-7  S        NI         Y

Young colony. What\'s that Scout Base doing here?)

0402  Bass          D223302-9  S        NI, P      Y

Outpost. Again, what\'s the Scout base doing?

0405  Lawes         EAC9200-8           NI         N

Low-budget scientific outpost studying the ecology of this
insidius atmosphere world.

0407  Marais        B1225A6-B           NI, P      Y

What is there to attract several hundred thousand people to this
low-G, near-vacuum pleasure resort? A garden world it ain\'t.

0408  Forqueray     A353546-B  N        NI, P      Y

Secondary naval base for this sub-sector. Naval shipyard capacity
could be split between this base and Galliard Base. The base have
enough imported high-tech spare parts to repair and maintain navy
ships, but civilians are restricted to local (TL 11) services.

0501  Pardessus     A114523-E  S        NI         Y

Main Scout base for the Sub-sector. Most of population is Scouts,
ex-Scouts, Scout\'s families and Scout Base support industry.

0506  Byrd          E460256-8           NI         Y

Another scientific outpost?

0509  Abel          D779443-5           NI         Y

Struggling colony.

0605  Simpson       A74A369-D           NI         Y

Why would anyone place a Class A starport in a system with a few
thousand inhabitants? And no bases to explain it. I\'d drop the
classification to B, I think.
The world is the property of the Simpson Memorial Foundation. The
Simpson Academy of the Arts and Sciences is build on the single
sizable island on the planet. The island has an area of 2.500
square kilometers and supports roughly 800 Fellows and Associates
of the Academy plus about ten times as many family members and
support personel (There\'s actually little distinction between
these two categories). The Academy owns a small fleet of research
vessels and the main business of the starport is maintaining these
vessels. The various scientific outposts in the subsector are
very likely Simpson Academy projects. The captive government
classification reflects the economic strings to the off-planet
Simpson Foundation.

0606  Gibbons       C474620-5           NI, AG     Y

Another regressed colony?

0607  Lassus        A250687-D           NI, P      Y

Mainworld. Propably mostly Imperial immigrants and their
descendants. This desert world must have some valuable
ressources to attract settlers. I\'d give them a local navy
base.

0704  Morley        C452633-6           NI, P      Y

Mainworld.

0705  Jenkins       E87A000-5           --         Y

I\'d drop the TL to 0.

0708  SUSATO        E584A67-5                      Y

Do yourself a favour and drop the population level to 9.
Otherwise this world will contribute more to the subsector
naval budget than all the other worlds together, despite the
unfavourable exchange rate.

0709  Adriano       A668125-C           NI         Y

Highly desirable planet with Class A Starport and only a few
score inhabitants? How to make sense of that? I would up the
population level to 6, 7 or 8, making it a very important world
locally (And give them a local naval base).
One alternate idea occured to me: A short while ago this was a
thriving world, but a plague wiped out the entire population.
Present population is a medical research team, the world is
quarantined and the starport is not functioning at the moment.
The research team would propably be larger; An unoccupied
T-norm planet with intact housing, high-tech industry and
starport facilities for millions of people would be a prize
beyond the dreams of avarice, and the pressure to find a cure
for the plague would be immense. Expect the political infighting
over control of this planet to overshadow any other concerns.
PCs getting involved in this would have an interesting time
(in the ancient chinese sense). (And how did that plague start,
anyway?)


0710  AGRICOLA      E56A976-9                      Y

The natives would have to be aquatic, not just amphibious. Good
luck working out their technology. It must be radically different
from human.
Or you could make them airbreathers (or humans for that matter) by
covering the world with hugh, thick floating mats of plant stuff
(shades of Jack Vance\'s Blue World) where \'land\' beasts have
evolved. The mats would have to be hundreds of meters thick and
many hundreds of kilometers across. Some mats would be anchored
to undersea mountain chains, others would drift around.
Political history would be quite fascinating. "In the year 456
a storm broke off the province of Ervorveu which drifted across
the Western Deep and finally joined the Giorgad Mat in 513".
Talk about the changing face of maps!

0803  Weelkes       C112888-A  S        NA         Y

Another of these punk worlds with huge populations. This time I
think it must be a mining colony that got cut off by the fall
of that interstellar community and managed to survive. Personally
I would cut the population level down to 6 or 7 anyway, possibly
simultaneously increasing the population of a more hospitable world
correspondingly.

0805  Baldwyn       A625343-A  S        NI         Y

Again a Class A starport without the population base to support it.
I\'d cut the starport class down to C and put an Ancient Base being
investigated by the Scouts here.

0806  Brade         C8B7410-7           NI         Y

Company world. Law level non-existent. I think any company would
maintain dicipline, so I\'d interpret that as "Law not enforced
outside starport compound" (Starport is owned by company  -  in
fact, it IS the company building). So how does the company make
money? Independent hunters or collectors goes out into that
corrosive atmosphere and collect something valuable (what?). The
company has a monoply on buying. They couldn\'t care less that
one hunter/collector kills another for his haul,  they get the
stuff in the end, anyway.

0808  Attaignant    E236200-8           NI         Y

Scientific outpost? Mining outpost?

Some additional ideas:

>If you use the Classic Traveller description of class A starports as the only
>facilities containing ship yards, and the shipyard capacities from Trillion
>Credit Squadron, you reach the conclusion that there are only four potential
>commercial shipbuilding sites in the subsector, at Galliard (TL14), Pardessus
>(TL14), Forqueray (TL11) and Lassus (TL13). The total "drydock" capacity of
>these four sites is 150 tons, 150 tons, 150 tons, and 1200 tons respectively.

Could be larger if the population multipliers for these worlds are high.

>Assuming a reasonable ship life, and a need to perform maintenance for two
>weeks out of each year, we find that Lassus can support a total fleet of
>shipping, military and civilian, totalling around 19,000 tons.

The one (roughly) ton shipyard capacity per 1000 inhabitants in TCS is
naval capacity only. No mention is made anywhere about civilian shipping.
My own rule of thumb is two ton of commercial shipping for each ton of
warship.

>Ships are either going to come from beyond the subsector, or be fairly
>scarce, or both. I don\'t know that this would work, so I have designated
>Weelkes as a potential ship source.

If you up the population of Adriano to something sensible you get your
ship source there. If you introduce the plague you get a ship source AND
a really desperate merchant community. Where are they going to get their
ships overhauled now? You could even make a ship overhaul the reward of an
adventure...

>So, does anyone have any ideas yet?

Not really... Well, perhaps a few more ;-)

History: Remains of some fleet arrives and settles on Susato, a planet
with a minor human race that have reached TL 7 or 8. Susato recieves a
technological boost that catapults them into the space age. Pal Gamba,
the nation that the fleet took over  -  eh, settled in, conquered all
of Susato and proceeded to colonize most of the good planets in the
subsector. The Greater Gambarian Empire held for a couple of generations,
but internal tensions were too great and a civil war destroyed the industry
on Susato and shattered the economies of the colonies. Plunge into
their own personal Long Night. A couple of centuries ago the Scouts
surveyed the subsector and slapped interdicts on most of the inhabited
worlds. Other worlds were colonized, however, and over the last century
the Scouts have been pressured into lifting the interdict on most of
the worlds. They still maintain import restrictions and the relationship
between the Scouts and the Traders is strained, to say the least.

Powerful organizations:

The Scouts      Retrenching, but they fight to maintain their hold.
The Navy        Moved in to guard against the neighbouring Whobahs.
GITT            Gamba Interstellar Trade & Transport LIC. Subsector-wide
                company trying to poke their sticky fingers in every-
                where they can get away with it. The greasy profiteers
                you love to hate. Headquartered on Madrigal and
                presently engaged in upgrading the starport.
SAAS            The Simpson Academy could be a useful patron in many
                situations. They have connections back to the Sector
                capital to trailing (The Simpson foundation is
                incorporated there), and can (in time) procure high-
                tech equipment and bring political pressure to bear.

Well, let me know what you think.

Now  that you have had a chance to look over the Gamba Subsector as  origi-
nally rolled, I\'ll show you the world descriptions I worked out.  These are
all  in  the  order that I have them in my notebook, and  you\'ll  notice  a
tendency  for them to get longer as we go on.  The order is fairly  random,
starting with those that were either more obvious or more in need of expla-
nation.  Additional information on the Agricolans will be included in  part
3.

THE WORLDS OF THE GAMBA SUBSECTOR:

Madrigal:   Most  noteworthy  features are a dense  tainted  atmosphere,  a
religious  dictatorship and an oppressive law level.  A combination of  the
Puritan and the Soviet Union, and maybe we\'ll get back to them later...

Agricola:  Standard  atmosphere water world, with a  native  population  of
mammalian amphibians, plus a human/dolphin colony.  The natives are balkan-
ized,  with  the main source of conflict being over islands which  are  re-
quired for breeding grounds and technology platforms.  Pregnant females and
young children can\'t swim, so they need boats or islands.

Susato: Dense atmosphere, dry world, governed from Lassus since the Imperi-
um intervened to prevent a global war about ten years ago.  The natives are
a  minor human race, although there are no known ancient sites on the  pla-
net.  <future enigma?>

Jenkins:  An  uninhabited  earth-like planet  with  a  tainted  atmosphere.
Obviously,  whatever the taint is can\'t be overcome economically  with  the
use of technology...

Violone:  Low  tech with a high population and a  captive  government--this
will need explanation, later...

Canzona: Settled by even more fanatical religious dissidents from Madrigal,
who  are  split up into groups that can\'t agree.   Potential  Amber  travel
classification.

Adriano:  This world is too good to pass up, so it\'s a new colony site, and
the population represents the advance survey team presently on the ground.

Motet:  An agricultural colony of Madrigal, ruled by a hereditary  vice-roy
of some sort.

Weelkes: As mentioned in part 2, Weelkes has been selected by the Gm as the
main  ship producing planet for the subsector.  So, while there is no  com-
mercial  shipyard as such, the Weelkes planetary navy is primarily made  up
of cargo carrying vessels.  In fact, the government of the planet is  obvi-
ously  a "macro-corporation" and the world will eventually have an  "indus-
trial" trade classification.

Brade,  Tenor: Mining colonies.  Tenor is a rich lanthanum source,  closely
guarded by the corporation which runs Weelkes.

Lassus:  Since I\'d like to have a little bit of an excuse for some reasona-
bly high tech manufacture, I\'ll declare that Lassus is famous as a robotics
center,  and  benefits from the output of a large "population"  of  robotic
factories.   Rather  Asimovian, crossed with "The People of  the  Wind"  by
Anderson.

Ricercar: X class starport, interdicted because of residual disease contam-
ination.   The local ecosystem produced a virulent mutant plague about  200
years  ago,  shortly  after the initial settlement.   Survivors  were  more
resistant,  but lost technology for a variety of reasons (to be  determined
if necessary later).  The current government structure has developed  along
bureaucratic/repressive  lines because of the need to follow an  aggressive
public  health/decontamination  policy.  Survivors were not  evacuated  for
"public health" reasons.

Baldwyn:  Ice-capped,  Mars-like planet with all population  geared  toward
starport services.  A few prospectors in outlying pre-fab habitats and  the
like...

Simpson:   Run from Lassus.  A waterworld with detailed  exploration  still
continuing.  There are very few scattered atolls, but interesting groups of
island-sized  floating  plant clusters (Anyone read "The  Demon  Breed"  by
Schmitz?).  The starport is a tethered submersible structure.  Like Lassus,
there is extensive use of robotics.

Gibbons:  Low tech agricultural planet with population mostly  spread  over
large  ranches  and/or  farms.  Main trading partner is  Lassus,  but  some
higher value luxury goods carried to Agricola, Susato and even Madrigal.

Morley:   Mining  colony economically dominated by Weelkes.   Some  farming
around  the  sea  coast, but extensive desalinization  facilities  (run  by
fission--fissionables are the main mining purpose) required for irrigation.

Attaingnant:   Icy rockball orbiting a gas giant, inhabited only  by  tran-
sient  freelance  miners.  Groundside is a bazaar  frequented  by  asteroid
mining  teams.   Law enforcement is a matter of having  bigger  lasers  and
calling out the posse.  Susato is the main recipient of the raw  materials.
The  mining equipment in the system includes lots of obsolete  space  junk,
including oddities like Agricolan built and crewed seekers.

Galliard:  Built as a research station over a hundred years ago for  inves-
tigation of the remains of the largest Ancient site in the subsector.   The
families  of  the  highly skilled researchers were  themselves  a  valuable
resource, and the University and naval base are today the main industries.

Abel:   Settled about thirty years ago by a dissident group of  Agricolans.
The  atmospheric  taint  (whatever it is) is something   that  bothers  the
Agricolans less than it does the humans.  Total population is about 20,000,
up  from an original group of 10,000.  There are fewer than  200  permanent
human residents, mostly associated with the Imperial government.

Fantasia:  The  starport  at Fantasia was completed a few  years  ago  with
Imperial  assistance.  Fantasia is one of the two colony sites in the  sub-
sector  being developed by the Imperium (the other being Adriano).   It  is
rather  heavy  for Agricolans (1.6 of their G\'s), but  tolerable  for  them
while  they are in the water.  Both humans and Agricolans  require  filters
against  the  atmospheric taint (excess CO2?), but it is  anticipated  that
introduction of terran-type vegetation will eventually bring the CO2 levels
down to human/Agricolan standards.

Pavane: Pavane was one of the first worlds settled in the subsector,  since
it could support life as is.  However, colonization proceeded slowly, since
a  more attractive colony site was being developed on Madrigal, and  scien-
tific  interest  was drawn to the Ancient site at Galliard and  the  native
populations  of  Susato and Agricola.  The conservative  culture  that  the
original colonists brought with them eventually became insular and xenopho-
bic, and stabilized there.  At present a growing faction of merchants  with
Imperial trade interests is agitating for changes, and are the targets of a
systematic  governmental campaign of suppression.  The planet\'s scout  base
is fairly isolated, on an island 50km or so off the coast in the main  sea.
Potential  Amber  Zone if guerrilla warfare breaks out.  Also  a  potential
site for arms smuggling adventures.

Lawes:   Lawes  is  a research station with  no  manufacturing  capability,
sustained by occasional chartered flights from Lassus.  The subject of  the
research is a highly classified Imperial secret, and _no_ reference will be
found in any database.  The cover story is that it is a potential lanthanum
mining  site, but a close examination of the available data will show  that
this is probably not true.

Byrd:  Byrd  is very similar to Lassus in a planetological  sense,  and  is
currently  occupied by a Lassus-based exploration organization.  Little  of
commercial  value has been found, and the current phase of  exploration  is
expected to end in a few years.

Treble:  Treble is a marginal colony world isolated due to its astrographi-
cal  position.  A group of fifty selected couples settled in 1096, and  the
population  in  1105 is 323.  The scout base consists of a  single  100-ton
sized hangar, a permanent staff of five, and a package fuel refiner.

Vielle:   Mining operation with an emphasis on fissionables extraction  for
export to Fantasia.

Bass:  All inhabitants are associated with the scout base, which was estab-
lished  to support an extended system survey after the discovery  of  trace
amounts of long half-life superheavy elements in an asteroid sample in 923.
Periodic  mining  rushes have occurred when additional deposits  have  been
identified,  but  have  seldom (never?) been  profitable  for  the  miners.
However, the Imperial government doesn\'t give up...

Bach:   Convenient station for Jump-2 traders bound to and  from  Madrigal.
Not  particularly useful otherwise, and basically a one city  planet  clus-
tered  around  the  starport.  A lot of trading  company  offices  and  the
like...

Haydn:  Haydn  remains unsettled due to a combination of  unpleasant  large
animals  and  tectonic instability in the temperate regions.   Despite  the
fact  that these problems have ended three previous  colonization  efforts,
two competing groups are currently attempting to set up colonies.   (Madri-
galans and Susatans?)

Pardessus:  A mineral rich planet chosen as the site of  a  self-sustaining
colonization  project  (with a view toward  developing  another  industrial
planet) by the Imperium about thirty years ago.  Lifeless planets have some
advantages when viewed as potential industrial worlds....Much of the  popu-
lation is Imperial veterans given shares in the colony as discharge  bonus-
es.

Marais: Developed as a companion to Forqueray with an emphasis on industri-
al growth.  Not very far along yet.

Forqueray:   A reasonably good planet, easier to settle than the others  in
the cluster.  As a result, it was colonized about 120 years ago.   However,
the  original constitution tied voting rights to land ownership, and  as  a
result the has been a split between the landed and the non-landed  classes.
Since  the planet has a high tech level, and regulation is light,  disgrun-
tled  non-landed inhabitants have a tendency to emigrate.  The  pattern  of
settlement is large estates with "rental villages" for the landless  inter-
spersed.  A fair amount of robotic agricultural gear imported from  Lassus.
Loosely inspired by Hermes from Poul Anderson\'s Mirkheim.

Violone: (Again) OK.  We\'ll make this one the inevitable lost colony dating
back  to  the  Rule of Man.  Much archaeological work remains  to  be  done
before the history of the planet is firmly established, but it appears that
a planetary nuclear war was fought about 2000 years ago.  In the aftermath,
the  survivors were reduced to TL0.  Recovery to TL3 was achieved  by  600,
and  cultural  stagnation set in.  Violone was recontacted by the  IISS  in
706,  and an administrative protectorate established.  Import  of  advanced
technology  is strictly forbidden.  The atmospheric taint rating is due  to
seasonal plant spore problems, which the natives have adapted to be able to
handle.  <Sorry, it\'s allergy season here in the U.S.>


OK.   Those are my versions of the worlds.  This has gotten long,  so  I\'ll
type  up  some  preliminary information on the Scout  bases,  the  Imperial
presence, and the Agricolans tomorrow.

As you see, I agreed with your assessment on this one.  There are certain
"classic" planet descriptions that seem to show up repeatedly in Traveller
literature, and this is one of them.

Not a bad idea, but I put the "university planet" and the "ancient site"
here.

Probably that subsector wide trading company that dominates Weelkes in my
description.  I agree, definitely outsiders.  Potential friction?  The trading
company scheme has the advantage that it gives the GM an excuse for tying up
the otherwise fairly lucrative 1-jump trading system that can be developed
between Madrigal and the agricultural worlds Motet and Canzona.

Prison planet might be OK, but the "who?" is a problem.  That\'s why I chose
this one for the "plague planet".

Probably.  In my book, I almost always use the "mining colony" description
when given the government type 1.

I agree with you.  This one is difficult.  I decided to rate it as a start-up
colony, though you are most likely right about it being delayed by political
infighting among various groups attempting to gain control.  I used the
"plague world" explanation on Ricercar.

The mats of floating plants is an obvious idea...my primary inspiration
was Schmitz, though I\'ve read The Blue World.  I like the idea of amphibians
better than purely aquatic lifefroms because it will make it easier for
them to interact with humans, and the Agricolans are one of the few
potentially interesting things going on in an otherwise bland subsector.
Besides the mats, up to 5% of the surface could still be land under an A
hydrographics classification.

Yes, but luckily there\'s only one in this subsector to explain.  It doesn\'t
stretch credulity too far to think that there is one world headed toward
being industrial that started life as a mining colony, does it?  Emigration
could be a problem though--maybe resentment against the segment of the
population that wants to leave (What comrade, you wish to leave now before
the end of the current Five Year Plan?)?

Well, I already put the Ancient site at Galliard.  Two might be too many to
put in this subsector.  Any other ideas?  As it stands now, the only important
thing that I know about this system is that it is on the X-Boat line.

OK.  I like this, so it\'s now "official".  What are they collecting?
Anybody else got any ideas?

So, at least one other GM looks at this and decides that we need those standard
items: "the university planet", the "plague world", the ancient site, and the
"lost colony".  What subsector would be complete without all four?

Once we\'ve discussed the explanations a bit more, we\'ll move on to the types
of adventures suggested by the worlds, and the combinations of worlds, in the
subsector.

Agreed.  Lassus is the only one that would then become large enough to
build bulk freighters and the like, though.  Also, recall that I planned
to stick to Book 2 ships for the most part...of course, even in High Guard
there\'s not much need for anything bigger than a ship big enough to carry
the 1000-ton sized meson gun.

I don\'t recall a specific ruling on this, and I always worked under the
assumption that it was the total capacity, figuring that in wartime the govern-
ment would take control of _all_ shipyards for war work, and in peacetime
they\'d contract the maintenance work that overflowed from the Navy shipyards
out to civilian shipyards, so that there was really very little distinction
between the two.  But, as I say, that\'s just my interpetation.  If you look at
the capacity for a Population 9 world, you tend to wonder what they are doing
with the surplus...

> History: Remains of some fleet arrives and settles on Susato...

Hmmm...I\'ll have to think about this.  I don\'t like the idea of having
quite so many regressed colonies, but it\'s not a bad explanation for the
current set-up.  Which worlds would be in which categories in this scheme?
Also, where would you put this subsector?  I sort of thought of it as
having the Great Rift somewhere nearby to the Spinward, making it someplace
in Daibei or thereabouts...

Not bad in general, and we\'ll use most of this, but we\'ll put their
headquarters on Weelkes, which they are trying to kick over the hump to
becoming a full industrial world.  The fact that they are looking out
for their competition is one of the reasons for their strong presence
on Madrigal, with the other being the lucrative trade with the adjacent
agricultural worlds...

As a group description I like this, but I still think that I\'ll put the
University with the ancient site on Galliard.  Otherwise, the same
sort of comments will apply to them...

While it is true that there\'s little possibility of GDW making a

how hard it would be to _not_ violate copyright on their collected
works if someone did an unlicensed product.

You\'d have to avoid referring to interstellar travel via a week-long
hyperspace as "jump".  You\'d have to try and keep "Imperium" out of
it for most intents and purposes.  All alien race names would be
verboten.  Star system names might even be covered.

Heck, the task system is probably copyrighted and -able, so it\'s
probably out, too.  Weapon names like "7mm Assault Rifle" or
"RAM GL" or "PGMP" are probably out.

Could someone say, publish a book and make use of some subset of these
ideas?  Likely.  They\'re not totally unique to Traveller in scifi
writing and gaming.  However, any significant subset of them,
say enough to make a viable module, would probably be a violation.

it doesn\'t matter \'cause they have to prove damages if they sue

This is another one of the classic Traveller worlds.  Will someone please
explain to me how a TL 8 world can support a class A starport?  As I
understand it, a class A starport can, by definition, build and repair
starships, i.e. jump drives, i.e. must be at least TL 9.  Bases, captive
worlds or other forms of outside influence might allow some outsider to
own, run and supply the starport independantly of the planet, but none of
these apply here.

An Agricultural world, using primitive tools and cheap labour to provide

The local government, supported by disgustingly high taxes, backed up by
a law level that prosecutes you if you sneeze the wrong way.  A great
place for PC\'s to stay away from, unless you want the following exchange:

Police: "You\'re under arrest for belching in the general direction of the
        palace."
PC:     "But I don\'t even know where the palace is!"
Police: "You\'re also charged with failing to possess official information.
        The total fine is Cr20,000 payable now, or Cr40,000 after a fair
        trial."

Guess why someone came and conquered it?  (Government 6 - captive world.
Someone round here is short of money, and decided to do something about it.)

I still think you need a considerable land area to evolve amphibians, but

Good idea. I use the "under Imperial administration" explanation for captive

Btw, keep in mind that those 40-odd minor human races works out at roughly
one per sector, so you don\'t want to use one without a good reason. I tend
to use them to provide an industrial and population base for fleeing
starfleets to establish star empires the way I suggested here.

More likely there are no useful biological products to attract exploiters
of this waterworld, and other type of settlers still have other places to
go to.

Hmm... I forgot the captive government rating when I tried to explain this

Some kind of world-wide catastrophe?

If this is not a regressed colony then there must be another reason for the

The problem is that a new colony site wouldn\'t have a Class A starport.
Starship construction would not be a priority if I wanted to establish a
new colony. Even starship maintenance would be performed at the home port.
They might have a B- port (Starship repair, but no spaceship construction)
but more likely a C+ (Full fuel facility). Secondly, 99 people is way too
few to open up a new world. An initial survey, sure, but how long ago do
you want the Imperial presence here to date back to? If it\'s more than 20
years this planet would\'ve been surveyed already. It\'s one of the top
goodies of the subsector. Can you imagine anyone passing this one up and
go settle Lassus instead?

Yes of course; I overlooked the government type. In that case it is more

outposts, where most of the people comes from somewhere else and intend

You can have more than one of each. And if you use a plague on Adriano,

No, but hundreds of millions? No mining colony needs that many people. IMO

The X-boat line explains the Scout base perfectly. As for the Class A
starport, I\'m predudiced against starship yards supported by a few
thousand people to dig the ore, refine the metal, build the machines to
build the tools to build the engines etc.. Whenever I find a Class A
starport on a world with less than half a million inhabitants, I tend
to look for an outside source of buyers for the ships like the Navy. If
I can\'t come up with a good explanation, I change the rating. (That\'s a
basic attitude. When I come across some unusual combination of stats I
spend 5 minutes trying to come up with an interesting explanation. Four
times out of five I succeed. But I don\'t insist on explaining everything.
Sometimes it is better to change a rating to something sensible.)

Me neither. As I wrote, there\'s no mention of civilian starships anywhere.

Any government that interfered too much with the merchant marine in wartime

Merchant Marine during WWII.

I think that the Naval Shipyard capacity reflects the maximum amount of
civilian capacity they can take over in wartime without ruining their
economy. But that\'s just MY interpretation.

The Gamban Empire lasted only long enough to put people on a lot of the
worlds. None of the colonies were self-supporting when the Empire fell
(The civil war was mostly between nations on Susato). Hence the whole-
sale regression.

>Which worlds would be in which categories in this scheme?

Gambanish populations might be found on a lot of the worlds. Suggestions:

Violone:  Settled by Gambans, regressed when Empire fell, rebuilt to TL
          6-7, nuclear bombed itself down to TL 0, advanced to TL 3.
          Interdicted until global catastrophy forced Scouts to step in
          (Massive tectonic burp? That makes the taint volcanic dust.)

Motet:    Settled by Gambans, regressed when Empire fell, rebuilding
          slow due to harsh environment. Interdicted by Scouts. Opened
          recently due to political pressure.

Madrigal  Same initial story, but had recovered to TL 4 by the time
          the Scouts got there. Scouts were forced to open world a
          generation ago.

Ricercar  Could still be a plague world. Or interdict could be the last
          Scout interdict left. This would entail putting a Scout base
          in the system.

Pavane, Canzona, possibly Gibbons could all have Gamban populations.

Adriano would have been colonized, no doubt about that. If you want
Adriano to be empty then they died out. If you take the plague story,
then they were there but not any more.

I\'m not either, and my thinking was along these lines: Many creatures evolve
to fit niches that are fairly restricted in geographical range.  If such a
species evolved intelligence, it would then be able to spread out beyond its
original range due to the adaptive power that intelligence (hopefully) brings
with it.  So, the fact that their unintelligent ancestors could only occupy
a small fraction of the planet\'s surface should not cause us any great
concern.  Are any of the people who were posting on the biology thread a
few weeks ago reading this?  Is this a reasonable position, or is it totally
unworkable.  As I mentioned before, I\'d like to keep the Agricolans amphibious
to make interactions with humans a little easier.  If It doesn\'t seem
reasonable now, how much would the hydrographic percentage have to be reduced
to make it reasonable?  9? 8?

Regarding the Susatans:

In general I agree, but since I am only going to do one subsector, I am a
little more willing to put in "one per sector" type features than I would be
if I was doing a whole sector.

You have a point.  OK.  Let\'s go for adventure potential.  Adriano was a
normal world with a population of 7 or 8 until a few years ago, when a
plague so violent and untreatable appeared and killed off the entire
population, as per your suggestion.  This will now be the single most
important feature of the entire subsector, as research will show that it
was a modified Ricercaran disease which _must_ have been deliberately
spread.  Who would gain by murdering an entire planetary population?
A mystery, and an overwhelmingly important one that must be solved soon!

(We won\'t leave this a mystery for ever, since it is my intention to decide
on all such details in this forum, as part of the GMing exercise originally
mentioned.)

Oh, I don\'t know about that.  HAving multiple prison planets, or planets
whose population was wiped out by plagues, in one subsector strikes me as
being too coincidental to be believable.  That\'s why, by the way, I think
we\'ll tie the Adriano plague in with Ricercar somehow.  I like the story
"hooks" to be as tangled as possible...


Regarding the question of the Scout base at Bach:

Routine maintenance and refueling.  It\'s probably not a very large base.

	I just got around to looking over the last few nights worth.  I have a few questions
about the GMing exercise:

	1)  Where is the Gamba subsector?  Things would be significantly different if it were
in the Trojan Reaches, as opposed to Core.

	2)  What is in the surrounding nine subsectors?  The artificial subsector boundaries
have always appalled me.  If there were a world like Trin just over the border in the next
subsector, the situation will be REALLY different.  And the hypothetical players can get from
the center of Gamba to one of the adjacent subsectors in only four weeks.

	3)  What type of group of characters are these hypothetical adventurerers?  Mercenary
types don\'t use the same kind of adventures as merchants (who probably would leave anyway).
Explorers/scouts would want something different than the merchants.  Or are these guys
supposed to be the generic thugs that GDW assumes in so many of their adventures?

Well, any I designed, for one.  These four stereotypes are all well and good, but they have
been overused to the point of boredom.

I don\'t like the "plague world".  What kind of plague is there that TL14 techniology shouldn\'t
be able to deal with?  Yes, I\'ve read "Speaker for the Dead", but I\'m not willing to bet that
something like the Descolada couldn\'t be beaten by Imperial technology.

As to "Ancient sites", I\'ve never bothered to use one.  Mostly because everyone I\'ve ever
played with has been completely turned off by the idea of playing archeologist.  And if it\'s
not archeology, it\'s dungeon plunging.

"lost colonies" are usually good for one adventure.  Seldom for more than one.  So I usually
don\'t bother.  But I don\'t have any religious objections to the presence of one.

"University Planets" I don\'t buy.  Not until someone can show me a "University country" on
Earth.  Talk about overspecialization.  Not to mention that the level of available shipping
already described wouldn\'t be able to handle the off-planet support required.

to add.

	"jump" has been in use in scifi for at least 40 years.
	"Imperium" is a good latin word for Empire.  It also has been used since the 60s in scifi.
(Anyone remember Perry Rhodan???)
	"Vargr" is a Scandinavian word for wolf.
	"Aslan" cannot be copyrighted, since the original copyright (C.S. Lewis\'s) has expired.
And the form they gave the Aslan seems to bear more than a passing resemblance to the guys
in the "Chanur" stories, by C.J. Cherryh (which I just reread.)
	"Efate" is an Island in the Pacific ocean.
	"Regina" is a city in Canada.
	"Mora" is a coach for the New Orleans Saints.
	"Zyra" was lifted from the movie version of "When Worlds Collide".
	The "Sword Worlds" individual names were taken from history, myth, and fiction.  The
collective name is from "Space Viking" by H. Beam Piper.  Even the culture seems awfully like
Piper\'s Sword Worlds.


> Weapon names like "7mm Assault Rifle" or "RAM GL" or "PGMP" are probably out.

There is or was a Swiss 7mm assault rifle.  So I doubt that that is copyrightable.  "PGMP"
is probably covered, though.  "RAM GL" is probably not.  Didn\'t the Army use that some years
back for one of their projects?  "ACR" isn\'t copyrightable - the Army has been running its "ACR
Competition" for years now to come up with the infantry weapon for next century.

I realize that the dreaded "Cymbeline virus" is old news to all of you, but
I thought I should point out an example of the abject stupidity of the lads
who are desparately reaching out to find an excuse for TNE:  the trip from
the Solomani Rim to the Zhodani border.  I notice in the article "When
Empires Fall" that the trip is described as 920 parsecs.  Pretty good
guess.  But wrong.  Getting out my Imperium map, I notice that the straight
route is about 240 parsecs.  Going the scenic route through Home/Aldebaran
stretches the trip to 350 parsecs.  If you go by way of the Hive homeworld,
you might get up to 500 parsecs.  If you go 90% of the way there, decide
you are too tired to make it, and turn back, and then when you are 90% of
the way home you decide you can make it after all, and so turn back again,
that trip is only 880 parsecs.   COME ON, you GDW studs.  Get it right.

I also notice that all the wonderful things they ascribe to the "Cymbeline
transponders" are things that we can do quite well without resorting to AI.

And they back-dated the discovery at Cymbeline by 40 years.

Are the guys at GDW even making an ATTEMPT at consistency???  It seems not.
<sigh>


I also notice the first hints of the method they have decided on to shift
old campaigns into the future:  their sleeper clubs are now offering
people a chance to sleep past Hard Times.  A remarkable idea, that.

WOULD YOU TRUST your life to a stranger during Hard Times???
Most everyone I know is too paranoid to trust their life to their friends,
much less a total stranger.  "Yes sir, we can guarantee that you won\'t be
broken up into spares for the body banks during your 70 year sleep."

                      THE 4.5TH COLUMNISTS
                               by
                          Scott Kellogg
                            - XXVII -
     Almost silently, figures carrying stretchers were hurried out
of Flamboyant\'s main lock and loaded into a G-Carrier.  The clicks
of armored heels distorted in the mutated acoustics of the hanger
to sound like dripping water.  The scent of blood wafted like an
icy perfume to where Tuerz froze, hidden under the Flamboyant\'s
starboard main landing gear wheel bogie.  He stood as a statue of
terror clutching the cold metal laser pistol close to his face for
all the comfort it offered.  The sickly sweet flavored stench of
blood and explosives tickled his nose as his hackles stood up in
sharp patches of pure hate.  Bile rose in his throat as he
recognized the stretcher cases being loaded by human shaped armor
with inhuman precision.
                           - XXVIII -
     ...One...  no, two leaving.
     Tuerz flattened himself against a wall in an alley as two
figures exactly the same height and weight came out of the Space
Winds bar.  They walked down the street heading for the docking
bay.
     He listened...  Only one left inside moving around...  A
cough:  human, male:  Whezel Kiriat.
     Tuerz strode in the front door:  a picture of seductiveness
wrapped in a black feather boa.  The black dress caressed his
bright red fur.  It was a strapless affair that showed the deep
cleavage of his two, five millimeter semi-automatic pistols.  It
came down far above mid-thigh, just covering the garters that held
two more of the tiny pistols.
     "Why hello Miss Tuerz!" boomed Whezel with a smile.
     "Hello, Whezel." returned Tuerz demurely.  "I\'m looking for my
crewmates.  I was supposed to meet them here but I\'m afraid I\'m a
little late.  You don\'t know where they\'ve gone do you?"
     "Why uh... no, I\'m afraid I don\'t know where they are...  but
now that I think of it, they did say they\'d be back soon.  Yes
that\'s right.  They asked me to tell you to wait here for them.
They\'ll be back shortly."
     Tuerz tail wagged slightly, "Well then you\'ll just have to
keep me company won\'t you?"  Tuerz hoisted himself up on the bar
and sat with his legs crossed under the very tight and brief dress.
He inclined his head and motioned Whezel to come closer.
     Whezel Kiriat moved his ponderous weight over eagerly and sat
on a bar stool close to Tuerz.
     Tuerz leaned his head and shoulders back, both emphasizing and
aiming his cleavage.  Whezel took a deep breath, beads of sweat
broke out on his greasy forehead.
     "Let\'s have some wine." Tuerz purred softly.
     Whezel jumped up clumsily and hustled around the bar.
"Anything you say!  Have some Zilan eiswein around here
somewhere... Nothing too good for...." He continued chattering
nervously as he hunted under the bar, while with one eye trying to
look up Tuerz skirt.
     Tuerz just smiled while his tail waved languidly and
alluringly.
     Finally, Whezel produced a pair of wine glasses and a sealed
bottle of wine  "Fine stuff this is:  \'53 eiswein, it comes all the
way from over in Aramis subsector..."  He fumbled with the seal and
popped the cork sending it flying across the room.  Eagerly, he
poured Tuerz a glass and held it out to him in a shaking hand.
     Tuerz tail waved stiffly as he flipped the boa around Whezel\'s
neck before taking his the offered glass.  "Do you think it will be
long before my crewmates get back?"
     "We have some time.  I don\'t know where they went."
     Tuerz sniffed the wine and sipped.
     "Are you sure?"  He playfully wrapped the boa around Whezel.
     "I\'m sorry, I have no idea."
     "I think you do."
     "I...."
     The plasteel cable in the boa cut the words off.  The cold end
of Tuerz iridium plated laser pistol found the man\'s nose.  Tuerz
tail finally wagged with genuine pleasure as Whezel\'s eyes went
wide in terror.  "So tell me, just where are they?"
                            - XXIX -
     Tuerz sighed as he wiped the scalpel carefully and examined
his specimen.  It had started badly.  Tuerz was too excited to do
the job nice and slow.  Already the fingers had been sacrificed
just to slake some of Tuerz thirst.
     Whezel was mostly bald to start with, the tuft of hair was not
a proper trophy even when you included the skin of the bald pate.
     But his mustache....
                             - XXX -
     Tuerz began twirling his laser pistol...
     Toe bone disconnected from the foot bone...
     Foot bone disconnected from the heel bone...
     Heel bone disconnected from the ankle bone...
     Ankle bone disconnected from the leg bone...
     Leg bone disconnected from the knee bone...
     Knee bone disconnected from the thigh bone...
     Thigh bone disconnected from the...

     "I\'ll talk..."
     Tuerz smiled as the laser pistol\'s target designator flicked
over the next threatened target.  He paused to sniff the smell of
the cooked meat of Whezel\'s right leg.
                            - XXXI -
     The hospital was deserted.
     A thin layer of dust had built up by the air filters.  Several
florescent panels were out.  One was flickering.
     Time passed...
     The panel flicked...
     After six minutes Tuerz ears picked it up:  A slight shuffle
as a guard shifted his muscles.  Sixteen meters away.
     Silently, he slunk down the corridor towards the sound.
Again, he froze.
     Four minutes later, he got his second signal:  a sigh thirteen
meters away.  A quick triangulation:  fourteen meters off the side
of the corridor in the third room off the side.  \'That sigh will be
the last sound you make.\'
     Not true, his head sizzled as bone and tissue vaporized under
an X-ray beam while his clothes rustled slightly as he slumped in
his chair.  But, in all fairness it was his last voluntary sound.
     \'Ten out of ten for execution, Five for style:  He never had
a chance to suffer.\'
     Tuerz glanced at the fallen gauss rifle:  powerful, but
clumsy, big, and very noisy.  He strapped it on his back.  A psi
helmet?...  could be useful...
                            - XXXII -
     Tuerz walked calmly into the medical lounge.  Four physicians,
seven nurses.  One looked up and caught a silenced five millimeter
slug on the bridge of his nose.  He fell over backward with a loud
crash.  Tuerz calmly picked his next target and squeezed the laser
pistol\'s trigger.  The doctors jumped up.  But none of them were
armed.
     Tuerz teeth shone as he waded into the room flooding the floor
and spattering the walls with blood as he came.  He was careful:
not a single wasted shot.  At first they tried to run but they were
quickly herded into a corner of the room.  Two tried desperately to
reach for communicators but neither lived to lift the receiver.
     In panic, the others threw coffee cups and books but none even
came close.  Some began to pray as the grinning angel of death sent
them to their reward.
     The last physician alive was on her knees crying when Tuerz
simply said, "It\'s all right, come on."
     She froze for a moment with tears streaming down her cheeks as
Tuerz waved his pistol toward the door.  Slowly, she rose to her
feet as though in a dream and climbed over the blood spattered
bodies of her friends.
     "It\'s all right," cooed Tuerz reassuringly, "We\'re going down
to the low berths and get some friends.  Do exactly what I say and
maybe I won\'t kill you."
                           - XXXIII -
     Kfoks could barely sit up in the low berth when Tuerz shoved
the gauss rifle into his arms.  Inside the regeneration tank,
Jietlshaiepr began to show signs of consciousness.  Tuerz herded
the doctor towards Rackan\'s low berth with his pistol.  Gresha was
too sick to be of much use.  Shtam would make it as a walking
wounded.
     Jietlshaiepr would be a stretcher case for a while, till her
psionics could get to work.
     They\'d done some cute work on Gdeerzorr.  The slugs and the
grenade had been removed and she was lying in a regen chamber.
Why?
     That left Kfoks, Rackan, Kaezorr, Niedrsha, and Miakr at full
charge, reflected Tuerz.
     He eyed the doctor carefully as she monitored the revival
phase, "If she keeps working like this, I just might let her
live...
     ...Nahh."
                            - XXXIV -
     Jietlshaiepr watched tiredly as Tuerz sent the hypo home into
the cephalic vein of her left arm.  He scrubbed the spot with
disinfectant and folded the arm up at the elbow.  She closed her
eyes and opened her mind to listen carefully to what her nerves
were telling her.
     Yes, the psi booster was starting to take effect... Then the
injuries slowly reported themselves.  Two ribs cracked...  They\'ve
been set and were already half knitted...  The serratus anterior
muscle has a rip in it...  Just nicked the pectoralis major...
missed my mammary by a centimeter and a half...  The armor must
have slowed it considerably, the lung is undamaged...
     The humerus is only bruised... but the biceps tissue is badly
ripped and is half missing...  Minor damage to the triceps and
deltoid... No damage to the brachial artery luckily... the bullets
must have missed by millimeters...
     With a psionic x-ray in her head she began to heal what she
could.  Tissue lost would have to be regrown and that\'s awfully
slow.  She deepened her concentration on the injured bones mentally
taking over the process of knitting the bone and healing tissue.
     Twenty minutes later she opened her eyes.  Niedrsha was
watching her carefully.  He caught up her left hand, "Hey babe,
what\'s the story?"
     She smiled weakly, "Right arm\'s out of order.  Psionics can
only accelerate healing so much, and I\'ve just about used all my
juice."
     Niedrsha leered wickedly and leaned close, "Well, I\'ll just
have to give you one of my custom psi boosts..."
     Jietlshaiepr smiled as she lifted a plastic vial to her lips.
Carefully, she bit into the straw to start the fluid flowing, and
began to suck voraciously at the fluid contained there.  The
regeneration diet supplement tasted bitter sweet as it coursed down
her throat.  Regeneration calls for high sugar and protein
concentration to rebuild damaged tissues.
     Niedrsha just stared at her teeth.
     Kfoks poked his muzzle around the door, "Sorry to break up the
party, but we\'re double parked outside..."
                            - XXXV -
     The main chamber of the settlement was not in a uniform state
of disrepair.  Close to the starport hangers there were a few
buildings which had decent facades.  Many of the others had been
ransacked for parts.  Some of the buildings were quite large.  The
stolen grav ambulance was well concealed in the abandoned building.
     Shtam was looking pale as he surveyed the group.  Radiation
drugs had taken their toll.  It would take time to build up his
strength, but time was not in abundance. "Look," he said tiredly,
"As far as they know, we are in the hospital and only Tuerz is on
the loose.  Odds are they got teams out there looking for him.
What ever they are hiding here, they do not need to hide any more.
Right now they must be feeling pretty safe."
     "But who ARE they?" wondered Miakr, "WHERE are they?  What the
Viepchakl are they hiding?  This doesn\'t make sense.  The whole
place is practically deserted, abandoned mines all over the
surface, nobody in town, and the handful in town are a bunch of
zombies."
     Shtam nodded, "I\'ve been thinking about that, let me put this
in front of you...
     "Suppose you wanted to take over an interstellar government.
How do you do it?  If you launch a full scale offensive, you get a
full scale reprisal right back in your lap.  But... what if you
come in the back door?...  Take a sparsely populated planet... wipe
the population out and substitute them with your forces."
     Jietlshaiepr nodded, "The butcher, the baker, the starport
machinist:  impostors."
     Kfoks thought aloud.  "You couldn\'t kill everyone who came
through.  If no ships never came back, somebody\'d get damn
suspicious."
     "Waitaminit," interjected Niedrsha, "Ralampago...  He\'d know
something was up.  Yeah, that\'s why they took \'em out.  .."
     Miakr looked skeptical.  "Ok, maybe you\'re right, but that
still doesn\'t explain what they\'re hiding.  A secret base?  This
place is falling apart around us.  And we\'ve checked out just about
everywhere else...
     "Except...  The old base..."
     Shtam shook his head.  "It\'s too radioactive:  look what it
did to me.  Also, it is in ruins."
     Miakr cocked his head, "Well, suppose it wasn\'t radiation..."
     "Yeah, *sure* right..."
     "Wait a minute, I mean suppose it wasn\'t radioactive *slag*,
but something else... like a particle accelerator?"
     Kfoks nodded, "That ruin is an old fighter base...  It might
be in ruins on the surface, but what about in the bunkers?..."
                            - XXXVI -
     The door to the mining colony\'s air raid shelter had been
deliberately hidden, somebody had wanted it to look disused, but it
clearly had been used frequently.  A security measure that had
started with a good idea, but camouflage deteriorates when
constantly disturbed.
     The muffled sounds of machinery echoed up from below barely
audible even to Tuerz sensitive ears off the sound proofed walls.
He was on point, forty meters from the team, cautiously edging down
the stairway leading into the bowels of the planet.  The floor here
was very clean, and would have clattered with noise if his boots
hadn\'t been left behind.
     Barefoot, he padded softly around a landing when he saw the
shadow around a corner.  Definitely human form:  unarmored,
fourteen meters away, no sound coming from him.  Not even
breathing.  Tuerz bit down on the implanted radio in his jaw three
times.
     Forty meters up the stairs, Kfoks held up a hand to the
others:  DANGER.
     Tuerz waited silently.  He strained his sensitive ears
carefully tuning out the sound of his own heart beat.
     No noise.
     Tuerz waited.
     No movement at all.
     Tuerz waited....  Weird...  Humans don\'t stand like that...
they shift, they make noise, they BREATHE.  The group forty meters
away makes more noise than this guy fourteen meters away.
     Nothing.
     Tuerz took a step.
     Nothing.
     His own silent steps sounded like a crash of symbols in his
tuned ears.  He paused five meters away from the corner to listen
for sounds his steps might have covered...  Nothing.
     Silently, he edged up to the corner.  The shadow seemed to
come from a light set on the wall around the corner.  Tuerz guessed
the light to be three meters down the wall according to the way the
corridor was lit.  By his shadow, the guard was half a meter from
the light.  That\'s where Tuerz prepared to fire.
     He poised to spring,
     and jumped.
     Tuerz flashed around the corner like a streak of lightning.
The thunder of his laser pistol struck the guard directly in the
forehead.
     The crown of his head crackled and exploded in flames.
Burning plastic and metal fell to the floor at his feet as he
slowly brought up his gauss rifle.
     Tuerz fired five shots in rapid secession as the remnant of a
human face glared at him hatefully.  The arm holding the gauss
rifle fell away as he continued to advance.  The x-rays sleeted
through the guard\'s body as he came on.
     Suddenly, the guard froze and fell facedown on the floor with
a loud crash.
                           - XXXVII -
     Niedrsha and Kfoks held the captured gauss rifles at the ready
listening for any sign of reinforcements.
     Miakr looked over the remains of the guard carefully.
"Definitely tech level twelve...  But it kinda looks like a tech
fourteen design...  Like it was copied or something...  The brain
is located in the lower abdomen.  Aim for that.  Head shots aren\'t
going to do much damage unless you hit in the eyes to blind it."
     He picked up the robot\'s skull and showed it to Tuerz.  "You
blew out his hydrogen fuel tank.  Lucky it didn\'t blow up."
     "Weird design:" noted Shtam, "the face and arms appear to be
the only thing made to look human.  The rest of it is plastic.  It
would not even pass a quick glance inspection."
     "That\'s why it\'s wearing a combat environment suit." nodded
Miakr.  "This wasn\'t meant to be seen without clothes.  Put it in
a business suit and you wouldn\'t be able to tell..."
                           - XXXVIII -
     Davis and Carton were lounging at the computer station.  Davis
sighed without patience as he listened to Carton\'s endless whine.
     "Look, we just gotta get a better assignment.  I\'m sick of
watching the inventory.  I just want a chance to *Use* it!"
     Davis\'s eyes rolled and he turned away to speak over his
shoulder.  "Yeah, well maybe the Skipper just got sick of hearing
you belly-ache."
     Carton failed to hear the annoyance in Davis\' voice, "Nah!
They just wanted my brains here minding the store.  But I\'m bored!
Bored!  BORED!  BORED!"
     Tuerz brightened his day with a sleet of X-rays.
     Carton\'s head exploded in a red mist which drenched Davis.
"Yeach!" bawled Davis as he turned around on Carton in disgust and
annoyance.
     Davis just had the time to recognize that Carton\'s mouth was
shut forever when Tuerz vaporized his face with high energy
photons.
     "He lost his head." sighed Kfoks as he glanced in the doorway.
"Good shooting, Tuerz."
     Tuerz strode into the terminal room sniffing the aroma of
fried brains.  He kicked Davis body from the chair, "All clear.
Looks like this falls in your court Miakr."
     Miakr stepped into the room and slipped on Carton\'s blood.
Kfoks grabbed his arm as he went down and hauled him up.  "Please,"
asked Kfoks, "with the computer:  no slip ups."
     Miakr dropped his eyes, "Right.  It shouldn\'t be too hard.
this guy\'s still logged in..."
                            - XXXIX -
     Miakr nodded up at the map on screen.  "They\'ve moved the ship
over to the base.  They kept the damn thing in plain sight.  Right
in the ruins."  Three icons on the map lit up bright red.  "Nobody
could get in there \'cause of the particle accelerator batteries
located up there."
     Shtam eyed the screen. "How is the ship?"
     "She\'s been slated for inspection.  Seems they\'re kinda
curious about us...  Pretty heavily guarded..."
     "The equipment?"
     "Locked up in a magazine near the ship... most of it anyway...
Looks like they took most of the robots over to a lab... For all
the good that will do them..."
     Niedrsha raised an eyebrow, "What do you mean?"
     "Well, Vole\'s got so much security protection, they\'ll never
get him working.  I rewrote the PPO2 warbot\'s command codes, with
the security protection already in place, it could take them days
to just start them."  Miakr laughed.  "It took me three days to get
inside them, oughta take them a week!  The robots from the Vixen
don\'t have any brains.  As far as I can see they left the master
unit on the ship.  There is no note that it was removed from the
main computer.  And the Tilly\'s have no brains either, not to
mention that they\'re built for Vargr operation.  No human would be
able to..."
     Kfoks grabbed Miakr by the shoulder, "You know where the
Tilly\'s are?"
     "Yeah..."
     Kfoks teeth shone in an almost human grin.  His voice dropped
to a murderous growl, "Show me..."

How about having a major shipping line set up a refit base here? Overall
tech level is kept just high enough to assure some comfort to citizens/
employees (government 2 _is_ corporation, isn\'t it? or is my memory
going?), while starport facilities are top-of-the line, but not acces-
sible outside the workplace.

How about this: the tech was recently upgraded when the surviving
members of the survey team decided to quit the Service and settle
on the planet. (Remember that a population code of 0 means less
than ten people, not no people.)They\'re cordial enough to trav-
elers, but they do their best to keep incoming ships to the land-
ing pad they\'ve laid out near their homes, and they ask visitors
to get their business over with and leave. The Scouts are, in
fact, protecting the indigenous population (which doesn\'t show up
on the surveys because they doctored the records) from exploi-
tation -- anyone have any ideas what the natives could have that
would be significant enough to Imperial interests that they
would be in mortal danger if the rest of the galaxy found out?
Atmospheric taint would likely be large amounts of water in the
air.

It may not have _needed_ that many people, but imagine a rush simi-
lar to the California Gold Rush of the 19th century. Folks with very
little money bought low passage to Weelkes, visions of lanthanum (or
whatever) dancing in their heads. Clever and unscrupulous outfit-
ters, restauranteurs, etc. kept prices high while the poor prospect-
ors tried to strike it rich enough to retire. As the resources began
to play out, competition threatened to send the small businessmen
under, so they started cooperating. Eventually, a planet-wide corpo-
ration came into being, still stiffing the population for its own
gain. When the planet got a little small for the corporate execs,
they expanded operations offworld.

Why not have the base on Baldwyn be a full-fledged way station? Baldwyn
would be the center of Scout activity in the subsector -- X-Boat produc-
tion, ship repair, logistics, all would be handled from Baldwyn instead
of the capital.

I think Rob mentioned Daibei as a possible location for the Gamba sub-
sector. That\'s far to coreward if I remember correctly (all my TRAVEL-
LER stuff is in Los Alamos, so I can\'t look it up right now). Near
Vargr space. It would be an interesting twist if the Gamban Empire
were a largely Vargr nation.

That might work, but either your memory is going or mine is - mine says
that 1 is corporate government, 2 is participating democracy.  But the
locals might allow an outside company to set up a starport, and then
charge rent for it.  Or the starport may have all the docks, cranes and
grav vehicles of a class A starport, but you have to bring your own spare
parts.

Either there is one family living there, or the local population was wiped
out by something but some of the machinery is still around.  That class E
starport on a water world of TL 5 makes me wonder if an enterprising team
of adventurers might be able to pick up an aircraft carrier for free? :-)

Or, perhaps there are a few people there, survivors of a ship which crash
landed.  I can just imagine their faces when the survey team said "This is
a _survey_ mission, not a rescue mission.  But we\'ve noted your presence -
a rescue team should be along some time soon" - just before the Imperium
collapsed. :-)

How about another race of aliens?  Either very small aliens, or something
like Star Trek\'s Horta.

	Not all of us have decided, Steve.

	Rather than coming to some kind of consensus, I would like the folks
on the list come up with a variety of interpretations of the subsector data.
I am a very inexperienced GM, and it might be more educational for me (and
others) to see how many different ways GMs can use the same data.  Steve, and
everybody else, if you\'ve got other ideas, I for one would love to see them.

	If somebody would please send me the raw data (I knew I should have
saved it), I\'ll take a crack at it myself.  As I said, I\'m inexperienced, but
perhaps my approach will be fresh enough to keep Steve happy....

"You\'d have to avoid referring to interstellar travel via a week-long
hyperspace as "jump".  You\'d have to try and keep "Imperium" out of
it for most intents and purposes.  All alien race names would be
verboten.  Star system names might even be covered."

"Heck, the task system is probably copyrighted and -able, so it\'s
probably out, too.  Weapon names like "7mm Assault Rifle" or
"RAM GL" or "PGMP" are probably out."

The only thing GDW could sue for is something that *they* made up.  So, yes,
you\'d have to swear off \'Imperium\', and most of the aliens that GDW made up.
But you could have aliens as similiar to GDW\'s as the originals GDW copied them
from.

Things like "jump", "ACR" are too generic for GDW to have a legitimite gripe.
RAM GL you could probably get away with.  PGMP is probably out.

But what the heck :-> what\'s in a name? :->

    'body' => 'Steve Higginbotham comments on the number of stereotyped worlds that have
been discussed for use in the Gamba subsector.

Let me take a moment to go over the origin of this thread:  I have gotten
bored with waiting for TNE to come out, or for GDW to dribble out bits of
information on the project, and I wanted to see some discussion here on the
TML.  Therefore, I started talking about the latest thing that I have been
working on, which is a single randomly rolled subsector, much like one
mihgt have started out with many years ago, when Traveller and I were both
much younger.  Since the initial world rolls were not terribly inspiring,
I thought that we might have a little fun by talking over what could be
done with such an unpromising set of statistics.

So, I\'d like to play this as what I think of as "the literary game", in
which we are stuck with a set of facts, however unlikely, and have to come
up with some web of description that will explain them.  This means that
we will leave the worlds just as they were rolled, and try to come up with
some explanation, however unlikely.  The real world is awfully unlikely
sometimes, too...

That\'s rule 1.

Rule 2 is that this is not a democracy.  There is no real goal to all of this
discussion, although you are all welcome to incorporate anything we come up
with into your campaign.  However, for purposes of keeping the discussion
going, I will eventually say "Officially this will be the way it is" and we\'ll
move on and discuss something else.  There\'s nothing like a committee of a
few dozen people to ensure that nothing is ever accomplished...

So, if you don\'t like the world stereotypes that are being discussed, Steve,
please (!!) jump in and throw in something else.  As I say, the only hard and
fast rule is that I don\'t want to change any of the rolled stats except as a
last resort.

Location: There is no good location for a subsector with these characteristics,
since anyplace in the main body of the Imperium (Earth-Core-Vland) has been
settled for far too long.  I\'d otherwise be inclined to put it somewhere on
the trailing side of the great rift, so that it was empty space (or nearly
so) out to the spinward.  As a second possibility, we could put it just to
the spinward of the Five Sisters subsector, which would give you a good idea
of how isolated I\'d like it to be.

Any other ideas?  For purposes of discussion, I\'d like to make it clear that
there is nothing interesting (like a TL15 industrial planet) just across the
boundaries in any direction, so that the players are obligated to stay within
the subsector.  In games that I\'ve played, I\'ve really never used more than
one or two subsectors in a campaign, so the theoretical speed of travel
remained theoretical.

As to the type of adventurers:  I\'d like to see the subsector set up with
adventure possibilities of as many types as possible.  _My_ usual course
of operations is to set up the background and then determine specific
adventures after the players become available.  The one thing we know would
be difficult is Scout adventures, since (like everywhere else in the
Traveller Universe) most of the real exploration has already been done.

Oh yes. Rule 3--No major changes in Traveller technology may be postulated
for purposes of this discussion.  We\'ll try to play this "by the book",
although the definition of "the book" may shift around a bit.

Steve objects to the use of plagues because he thinks that TLxx medicine will
be able to handle everything.  Is there anyone out there who is extremely
familiar with the series of medical articles run in The Traveller\'s Digest?
How did they work out in practice?  Any other comments on this subject?  I\'m
still flexible, really...

0106  Galliard     A100505-E N    NI   Y
X-Boat Link

When I think about Class A starports, I have a little trouble
sometimes.  I tend to envision large international airports:
Dulles, Atlanta, BWI, LAX, Chicago, Heathrow, Newark etc.  Now
those to me say \'Class A\'.  However, not one of those has anything
to do with manufacturing capacity.

Where are the big ship builders/aircraft manufacturers?  Well, most
of the US aircraft companies are out on the west coast.  Boeing\'s
out there in Washington state, Lockheed\'s in California, the ship
builders aren\'t exactly in the large population ports either.  GE
Boats are out in Conneticut.  Norfolk is a large place, but it\'s
not the HUGE place one thinks of when one say\'s \'Class A\' port.

Point being, that the ship building yards may not always mean there
is a large port or a large amount of traffic going in and out.

So, what do we need for a large ship building yard?  Mainly
resources.  Those resources are the material to physically make the
ship, and the technology to make it work.

The technicians needed can be brought in.

The parallel is steel plants.  Now, most people would imagine that
steel mills would be ideally located near large deposits of iron
ore right?  Wrong!  Steel mills are ideally located near large COAL
deposits.  The process of making steel requires more coal than it
does iron ore.  (Pittsburgh?)

Ok, now with economics still working that way, Ship yards need to
be located near large mineral deposits and sufficient technlogy
back there to build it up.  Technicians can be shipped in.

Galliard is one of the main ship builders of Gamba.  The system has
a rich asteroid belt with several drydock asteroids.  The Navy uses
the TL 14 ship yard (Galli-Yard) to maintain some of their older
escorts and as a storage facility for the sector\'s mothball fleet.
The university of Galliard has a highly accredited naval
architectural and engineering graduate program.

The ancient site there is of course highly classified, however,
rumors indicate that the Galli-Yards, were built over the grounds
of the site.  This has prompted speculation that the ancient site
was originally a shipyard, and that the Navy supposedly took
advantage of the University\'s excavation/reconstruction of the
site.  The truth of the matter is unknown, but the University
students are known to encourage the rumor.  Indeed, they point to
the presence of the sector\'s only accredited post graduate naval
archeology program as evidence of the yard\'s quality.  The Ancient
Society of Engineers is a group of naval architecture and
engineering students which claims to design and maintain ancient
starships.  (Evidence is however that this is simply a group of
drunken students)  :-)

There is also the unexplained date of the founding of the yard:  It
is on the Imperial registry as the oldest operational shipyard, and
is dated as being founded -201,007 years Pre-Imperium.

Virtually all the population is employed at the Galli-Yards, and at
present the yard is capable of docking craft of up to 100,000 tons,
however, there is insufficient dockhands to handle such craft.  The
Navy however, has been known to over-use this facility and (though
uncomfirmed) there are rumors that TL 14 craft as large as 500,000
tons are in mothball orbits around Galliard.

Galli-Yard has been petitioning the Navy for additional funds to
run the yard properly, but the maintainance of TL 14 craft is not
in the high priorties of the Imperial Navy.  The yard has recently
been making overtures to the Scout service and the Marines for
additional funds.  The Galliard University hopes to update their
equipment to rate a TL 15 and thereby regain the Navy\'s funding and
support.  At present, the Galli-Yard has a very small TL 15
capability, and it is capable of handling small craft of up to 150
tons displacement.  The Navy however has been discouraging the
updating of equipment as it would mean a realignment of forces in
the sector, and loss of contracts made with other yards.

Just picked up Challenge 65.  There\'s no more on how the Virus works,
but first hints that\'s it\'s running around are in the Traveller News Service.
A bunch of K\'kree ships got zotted by naval forces for showing improper
transponder codes, and in our friendly neighborhood Domain of Deneb,
some Aslan in the Patrol (with a Azhanti HL class cruiser missing for 3+
years) nearly got zapped after they showed up at the Trin naval
base in a hurry with their transponders disconnected.  They had to use
one-time-code authentication to identify themselves.  I\'m willing to
place money (small money 8-) on them having been on a special mission
in the imperial core, that they figured out what\'s going
on, "safed" their ship by disconnecting the Deyo circuits, and run for
the Domain with the news and warning...

Or maybe not.

Btw, it\'s the Horror special issue.  One horror MT adventure (knockoff
on The Thing and perhaps T:2) and one hard times adventure.  And a
Merc:2000 adventure by yours truly (I think I may have blown any chance
of ever GMing T:2k or Merc at cons with this and `Suprise Party`).

PS: just got some info from Michelle Sturgeon at GDW.  Don\'t bother
sending in MT submissions; they\'re putting off accepting anything
until the TNE rules are out.  If you get a TNE set somehow, then
by all means, submit something for it, but not until then 8-)

About the "Virus" and Challenge 64:

*SIGH*  I\'ve just about given up; someone (actually many someones) at
GDW has forgotten that the name of the game is Science-Fiction Roleplaying.
The Challenge material fails as science-fiction: it fails to consider
the effect of the development of sentient computer chips within the
context of human society.  In other words, the author should pose to him
or her self a series of "What if ..." questions, looking for plausible
answers that present interesting story opportunities.

I find it extremely difficult to believe that the question "What if
someone discovered intelligent computer chips?" has one and only one
answer: "People would build them into walkie-talkies and forget their
very existance."  What about the issue of "all sentient life-forms are
protected citizens of the Imperium".  These sophont computer chips are
naturally-occurring, evolved creatures; definitely life-forms!  Is this
a major form of slavery within interstellar society, or are the Cymbiots
paid employees of the ship owner, free to quit at any time?  If they are
de-facto slaves, how do they feel about it?  They are sentient creatures
capable of forming their own opinions, aren\'t they?  How have they
affected the computer, robotics, and information industries?  How do
humans feel about these intelligences; are they threatened by such an
alien intelligence?  What are the primary motivations, goals, desires,
and philosophies of these creatures?  Does anyone at GDW have any
functioning brain cells left?

Sorry for the sarcastic tone, but this is *DISCOURAGING*

(The above can be forwarded to GDW if anyone thinks that it will make
any sort of difference at this point.  Personally I feel that GDW is
determined to create a product that will be as much of a commercial
success as Space:1889 and will be as long-lived as Traveller:2300)

Now on a (slightly) more upbeat note, *IF* TNE is at all playable as a
rules system, *AND* if it is adaptable to a different background than
the New Era (both looking like pretty big if\'s at this point), then how
about all of us here on TML createing a co-operative background history?
One that makes sense, and one that we can all use to build on
one-another\'s efforts.  TML has the capacity of generating several times
the output of GDW, at least as far as background material is concerned.
I rather like Robert Dean\'s subsector project as a pilot project for
this sort of thing.

For me, the Rebellion was not even worth playing in.  We used the MT
rules on several occasions, and the Rebellion background once.  All in
all, everyone enjoyed the game; but everyone was also quite sick of
death, destruction, factioanlism and civil war by the time the campaign
ended.  And as near as I can tell right now, the New Era is going to be
even worse.

I get the overwhelming impression that nobody at GDW is really
interested in what anyone else has to say.  A lot of the TML traffic is
rules variants, or pertains to one or more divergent background
histories.  Do you really think that GDW is interested in this stuff?

OK, I\'ll give it a try.  I have literally reams of stuff here in my

criticism.  If anyone thinks that it is worth the postage, I will then
submit it to GDW.  Fair warning, though: more than 90% of it pertains to

How about a stutterwarp-powered missile (or better yet, a whole bunch of
them) launched from a conventional ship.  Instead of high explosive,
have a proximity fuse connected to a sandcaster round.  Have the missile
home in on the stutterwarp ship, and detonate in its path.  If the ship
is not too badly damaged by this, then launch a bunch more, and surround
the ship with sand.  Now that you\'ve gotten the thing to stand still,
you can fire at it with conventional weapons, or come alongside at your
lesiure for a boarding action.

Robert S. Dean\'s "Gamba Project" (A capital idea!):
A couple of points about my interpretation of world statistics.  First
of all, I interpret them as reflecting the status of the world\'s
residents, without traders, military or scout personnel, or any Imperial
facilities.

Second, I assume that all Class-A starports are effectively at TL-10
and Class-B starports are effectively TL-9 (even if the world TL is
lower; this simply means that spare parts and technical crews are
imported from off-world).

A couple of worlds strike me as having a good bit of potential:

0109  Motet         C898735-3           AG         Y
Obviously an agro world feeding Madrigal, and maybe other parts of the
subsector as well.  Good destination for traders looking for an unususl
cargo

0110  MADRIGAL      B7989DE-6  S        IND        Y
The industrial powerhouse of the subsector.  I don\'t believe that
commercially important worlds need to be high-tech.  Madrigal is quite
capable of producing industrial goods that would be useful to worlds
anywhere from TL-3 to TL-9 (which includes most of the worlds in the
subsector).  For export to lower-tech worlds, it probably produces heavy
machinery and mining and agricultural equipment; for high tech worlds,
Madrigal likely exports machine tools, precision equipment, and some
consumer goods.  It also is the major source of refined chemicals and
bulk metals (iron and steel ingots, barstock, plates, pipes and other
useful materials).  Total production is likely to be more than a
hundred million tons annually.  The class B starport is maintained
by and for the convenience of Madrigal\'s customers, and the cost of imported
skills and technology is part of the cost of doing business.

Madrigal may even be able to fabricate starship hulls, hull components,
drive mounts, weapons systems, turrets, and dozens of other fittings for
spacecraft which can be fabricated with their technology.  These
components can them be shipped to other, higher-tech worlds for
assembly, and installation of the high-tech drives, computers, and
equipment.  In this way, the limited shipyard capacity of the subsector
might be augmented (a shipyard crew could assemble a Liberty ship in
under 100 hours from pre-fab parts; Kaiser even made escort carriers
this way; nearly 100 of these CVE\'s were built between 1943 and
1945).

Given the government and high law level, I would suggest that Madrigal\'s
religeon promotes a strong work ethic and a strict code of behavoir.
Since the government is the religeon, such codes would have the force of
law; not a problem for believers, but for off-worlders and
non-believers, the code of conduct, clothing and
behavoir standards, and required observances would be nearly impossible
to keep straight.  Quite possibly unbelievers, heretics, and political
dissidents are exiled to a specific geographic area (probably originally
an undesirable island or sub-continent.  The starport is probably also
located here (off-worlders are unbelievers, after all); believers are
allowed to travel to the starport (but consider it distasteful or
faintly sinful), while unbelievers and offworlders are restricted.

As the only industrial world in the subsector, Madrigal probably is used
to being in a seller\'s market; there may be increasing tension between
Madrigal and other worlds (primarily Weelkes).  Madrigal\'s strategy is
probably to try to increase its tech level to stay competitive.

0405  Lawes         EAC9200-8           NI         N
Known locally as "Lawless"; a rough-and-ready mining outpost.

0408  Forqueray     A353546-B  N        NI, P      Y
The primary Imperial Navy base of the area; most of the "permanent"
inhabitabts (thos that show on the UPP) are in some way connected to the
Navy base: contractors, civillian support staff, dependents, merchants
and all the business that would usually surround a major installation.
The TL of 11 probably represents the average amenities enjoyed by the
pernament residents.  The Naval facilities are probably on a par with
usual Imperial Navy practice: TL-14 or TL-15, including shipyards, a
naval medical center, and probably a mothball fleet orbiting somewhere
in the system.  Civillian contractors will happily do work for private
citizens, too (provided such work does not interfere with their Navy
commitments); therefore this world probably has an effectively TL-15
capability for starship construction and repair (but you will probably
pay several times the normal rate for the work).

0501  Pardessus     A114523-E  S        NI         Y
Given the high TL and the scout base here, Pardessus is probably a major
IISS facility; certainly the primary site for Scout construction,
maintainance, training, and operational control in this subsector.  In
many ways it will be the IISS equivalent of Forqueray.

0803  Weelkes       C112888-A  S        NA         Y
Weelkes is almost an industrial world; but it is handicapped by a small
labor force, and an inadequate starport (which probably reflects a
general under-capitalization of the whole economy).  Presumably this is
because an inordinate amount of resources are consumed simply by living
on this rather inhospitable world.  Presumable selected because of the
ready availability of some resource (ore? solar power?).  Presumably the
major priorities of the government is to encourage immigration and
off-world investment, so that Weelkes can "ramp up" to being a major
industrial producer.

An source of adventures might be the increasing rivalry between Weelkes
and Madrigal.  Madrigal can offer high-quality, relatively low-tech
goods and a reputation for delivering on time and under budget.  Weelkes
can offer high-tech (at least, high-tech for this subsector) goods, but
is probably having quality-control and delivery problems.  But they are
number two: they try harder.

I would apply population multipliers (something I did even before Grand
Survey came out for Classic Traveller) to all of the worlds.  Throwing
my trusty d10, for the four shipbuilding worlds, I get multipliers of 5,
9, 1, and 6; this would make the shipyard capacities 750, 1,350, 150,
and 7,200 tons respectively.  If prefab parts from Madrigal are used to
speed construction, it might even be reasonable to assume that shipyards
on these worlds achieve two or three times the average productivity when
working with standard designs (on the other hand, the average wait for
custom designs may be several years before constrution even begins).

This gives us a total of 491,400 ton-weeks of shipyard capacity for
construction.  I will assume (without checking my facts, though) that
Madrigal, Marais, Fantasia, Simpson, and Adriano are negligible in
construction and maintainance capacity (Madrigal probably is not).
The equilibrum equation is X=(U*(N+M))/(4+(T/L)) and the condition is
that X<=(U*N)/(T/L).
U == Shipyard Utilization Factor == 1.00
N == New Ship Construction Capacity == 491,400 ton-weeks
M == Maintainance Capacity == assumed to be zero
T == Ship Construction Time == 9600 ton-weeks for a 200 ton ship
L == Lifespan of an average ship == 100 years if well maintained
Therefore, X is approximately 510 ships, or 102,000 aggregate tons.
This fleet is composed of smaller ships than the average for the
Imperium, and they are older than the average, as well.  Since the
shipbuilding capacity of the Imperium is not evenly distributed, it
seems reasonable that many ships are imported from outside the subsector
to suppliment the local production.  Most ships are probably 200 ton
types, with a small number of 400 and 800 ton ships (a *VERY* small
number, probably; and most of them imported).  Forqueray is probably new
in the starship construction business, and probably produces only two or
three designs (a type S, a purpose-built seeker, and a 150-ton "stretch
seeker" intended as a low-cost general merchanter).

It would be reasonable to assume that Weelkes is trying to become an
Industrial world, and can rapidly eclipse Madrigal as an important world
in the subsector.  Let\'s rather arbitrarily assign it a population
multiplier of 5.  With a starport of class C, Weelkes is not going to be
able to produce starships for a while, but we can assume that they are
currently in the process of upgrading to class B by installing shipyards
but there are not yet jump-drive fabrication facilities.

I don\'t ever remember a clear ruling on this either, but I have always
assumed that the capacity rules from TCS were total capacity.  Then
again, I have also used the population multipliers in the TCS formula
(which was originally written before there *WERE* population
multipliers), so my calculations average about 5 times the total ship
production capacity as the original TCS rules.  My rationalization is
that the original TCS rules considered only the shipyard capacity
available for military construction, while the results with the
population multipliers produce *TOTAL* capacity.  I freely admit that
this assumption is crude at best, and may be unworkable.  Anybody care
to think up a variant rule for this (there is one percolating in the
back of my mind, but it is not ready to come out yet).

Another data point for trade-and-commerce economics fans: Immediately
prior to the outbreak of WWII, the British Isles imported about 55
million tons annually.  Included in this total was about all of Great
Britian\'s POL (Petrol/Oil/Lubricants) needs, most of her foodstuffs
nearly all of the ores and raw materials required by her industry, and a
suprising amount of manufactured goods (particularly machine tools).
During the worst part of the Battle of the Atlantic, imports were
reduced to an annulized rate of 30 million tons per year (about half of
this was food).  During the war, the US firm of Kaiser produced
prefabricated ships (Liberty Ships).  Each one displaced about 4000 tons
(that\'s tons *MASS* folks, empty) and could carry about 7000 tons of
cargo (again, tons *MASS*).  The Liberty ships could make about 12-14
knots, and could be built in as little as 4 days (from prefabricated
components, working round-the-clock). *** The preceeding data from
Keegan\'s _The Price of Admiraly_; more recommended reading for TML-ers.

In TRAVELLER terms, a liberty ship is about 800 displacement tons
(assuming that the average cargo is about 1 mass ton per cubic meter of
volume) with about 500 displacement tons of cargo (no passengers).
By figuring the average journey to and from resource worlds, one can
figure out the number of ships needed to supply the required level of
imports.

55 million tons annually is about 7860 full loads for the hypothetical
Traveller starship described above.  Assuming that the ship only makes
jump-1 (reasonable, because 62.5% of this ship is devoted to cargo), and
that the average source world is two parsecs away, then we have a
minimum round-trip voyage of 6 weeks per load (two weeks outbound, one
week loading, two weels inbound, and one week to unload; a
minimum-length refuelling stopover is assumed at the intermediate
point).  Each ship makes 8 trips per year, with four weeks for overhaul.
Therefore, the merchant fleet serving this world will have to be about
983 ships with an aggregate tonnage of 786,400 displacement tons.  THe
traffic flow rate will be between 21 and 22 arrivals per day (with a like
number of departures, of course).

Remember - this is to support a population and economy the size of
pre-WWII british isles.  Some Traveller high-population worlds will have
single cities larger than this.

How about from the same sect that colonized Madrigal (both planets
colonized at the same time from approximately the same population
source, with roughly the same beliefs).  On Madrigal, the religon has
remained homogenous (probably for geopolitical reasons, combined with
the tendancy to isolate dissidents on an island).  On Canzona, the
church has split into many different sects (nations) each one claiming
to be the One True Faith.  Disputes over borders, resources, and
religious questions cause minor wars all the time.  Amber zone

Well, it depends on what the corrosive atmosphere is made out of.  My
suggestion is that the atmosphere contains various and sundry nasty
gasses (cyanide, chlorine, or ammonia come to mind, although some more
interesting organic compounds might be a good idea).  However, a number
of very interesting plants grow here; the raw plant material is
manufactured into drugs, spices, and "recreational pharmecuticals"
(depending of course, on which plant is harvested, and who does the
processing).  The plants extract compounds from the atmosphere
and combine them with trace minerals from their growing region to "build"
the substances of interest.  So far, actually farming the plants has
proven impractical, and synthesizing the compounds is more expensive
than refining them from plant matter (but research continues on both
fronts).

THe best plants probably grow in specialized habitats (for example, one
kind might be semi-aquatic, and grow like lily-pads in shallow pools of
whatever nasty substance passes for water on Brade.

A pharmecutical corporation (SuSAG?) operates the starport and is the
only legal purchaser of the raw Bradeian plants.  Some species are
refined into drugs, while others are sold as spices.  Because of the
nature of SuSAG\'s monopoly, there are a number of attempts at "Black
Market" harvesting - especially for the illegal drug trade.  Wilderness
landings on Brade are possible, but dangerous (for two reasons; the
planet is dangerous enough to begin with, and SuSAG takes very unkindly
to smugglers).

In addition to the various human threats, some of the animal life-forms
of Brade can be dangerous to the unwary.  Alltogether, the life of a
Bradeian Gatherer is not an easy one.  Because there is no effective law
on Brade save what SuSAG wants to enforce, many of the gatherers are
fugitives from other worlds in the subsector.

I usually treat cases like this as meaning that the sustained TL of the
world is 8; however, the starport has (at a minimum) TL-10 facilities
available.  In cases like this it means that either the world is more
advanced in space travel than in most other areas (unlikely), or that
the parts and skills are imported from more advanced worlds.  In many
cases this would be because the world is an important importer or
exporter; in others this would be because it is located astride several
trade routes, and is in a convenient location for serving many
starships.  Other possabilities include a corporate service facility
which uses offworld technology and local (read cheap) labor or
real-estate.

Madrigal is an industrial world; they probably charge the cost of the
port to their customers.  They are the only one in the subsector, and
can probably charge whatever they want for machine tools, processed
chemicals, and milled steel.  So they probably have a strong economy,
and enjoy a substantial trade surplus (and a law level that prosecutes
you if you fail to utter the proper prayer after sneezing).

As far as I know, there aren\'t any anywhere.  We should probably hammer
some out; I think that the shipyard capacity should be based on
population, tech level, trade classification, and perhaps on government
type and/or law level.  The biggest problem is in deciding what level of
interstellar commerce we want the result to reflect; perhaps this can be
reduced to a table of factors.

Exactly.  In wartime, the government would probably supervise production
to make the most out of the available capacity.  Merchant Marine ships
would probably be restricted to a few absolutely standard, well-proven
designs that lend themselves to mass production and pre-fabricated
parts.  Other industries would be pressed into service making these
parts (example: Singer\'s sewing machine factories produced machinegun
parts during WWII, and many automotive plants were used to produce
aircraft components).  Reserve capacity would be utilized, and efficency
increased, so that additional capacity was available for warship
construction.

Existing TRAVELLER rules (Trillion Credit Squadron and Fifth Frontier
War) do not really provide for any type of economic warfare (in the
sense that it was waged in WWII by Germany\'s U-boats in attempting to
cut off Britain\'s imports and starve the country into submission; or
even in the sense conducted by the Allied strategic bombing campaign in
attempting to destroy the enemy\'s industrial ability to wage war).
Because of this, it is extremely difficult to gauge the level of
interstellar trade, and the effects of different wartime strategies on
trade and planetary economies.  This is probably something we can fix
here on TML; once these questions are answered, it becomes much easier
to talk about piracy, economic warfare, and tax bases for inperial
budgets.

There are probably very few diseases that couldn\'t be beaten by Imperial
technology.  However, there will still be plague worlds: the question is
will the population be decimated before effective help arrives?  How far
away is the help in relation to the speed of the spread of the disease?
After such a disaster, it may be easier and cheaper to simply interdict
the world than to try and develop and disseminate a cure.

Well, in the past my players have included an anthropologist and an
archaeologist ---- you might say they were interested; one of them even
turned what I thought was going to be a simple dungeon crawl into a
full-fledged dig.  Anchient sites *can* be fun, but you\'ve got to think
more in terms of archaeology a la Indiana Jones rather than archaeology
as it is actually practised as a science.  Good examples include FASA\'s
"Legend of the Sky Raiders" and "Trail of the Sky Raiders", or the

Well, while there may not be any purely academic planets in a backwater
like Gamba, there is probably at least one somewhere in the Imperium.
On the other hand, there may be a world well-known for its excellence in
education, that draws the best students from many parsecs around to
study in its institutions.  While there are no "university countries"
here on earth, many students come from abroad to study at US colleges,
and the US has many "university cities" - take Blacksburg VA as an
example.


Oh, on the subject of the original SF origins of GDW\'s Traveller
concepts, I note that there is a planet Mongo in the Jewell subsector.
Somehow, I sincerely doubt that this name originated at GDW; in fact, I
wonder if it was used with permission?

As a point of fact, I doubt that there are very many things in Traveller
that were not written about in SF literature first.  Marc Miller and GDW
were simply the first to take all of the elements of classic
hard-science SF and assemble them all in a role-playing game.

In a case like this, why wouldn\'t the normal IISS protective
interdiction be better?  Is there some reason why protective
interdiction was not granted, or even asked for?  Are the scouts
themelves exploiting the indegenous population?  I think this part needs

This counts as a taint?  I\'ve always assumed that a taint was something
which would be extremely unpleaseant at very best, is usually harmful,
and can be fatal at worst.  Then again, I\'m in the Washington, DC area,
and we have large amounts of water in the air for most of the summer.

How about one of these two:  Jenkins could belong to a single family
(likely noble, or filthy rich, or both) who maintain a residence on this
otherwise commercially-unexploitable world for pleasure (perhaps
great-grandad, founder of the sector-wide trading line, was an avid
fisherman, and Jenkins is where he put his "fishing lodge").  The
current head of the family is more interested in making money than going
fishing, and visits only very rarely; the only permanent residents being
the caretaker and his family.  Another classic alternative would be a
colony-ship that was bound for a different world misjumped
or crash-landed here.  The few survivors proceeded to do the best they
could, and hope for rescue.  By the time they were discovered, the
remaining colonists had given up on rescue, and had built a life for
themselves on Jenkins; therefore they refused "rescue".  Now the
colonizing agency has a problem: should they support this de-facto
colony on Jenkins or not?  And how would the current residents of
Jenkins feel about a whole horde of new colonists descending on their
little island colony?

Well, from the Traveller rules, there is not much "official" difference
between Class A, B, and C ports *EXCEPT* the availability of shipyards
for construction and repair.  By extension, the class A and B ports have
more traffic, as both a cause and an effect of their repair and
construction facilities.

You might be better off thinking of starports the way an 18th- or 19th-
century sea captain might think about seaports.  The best ports (like
Baltimore, Liverpool, Cherbourg, Brest, Boston, and many others) could
supply almost anything needed in the way of provisions, and repairs.
Shipyards where there to construct new ships; drydocks were available
for major repairs, and any number of businesses catered to the maritime
trade.  The second-class ports had no builder\'s ways or drydocks, but
could do almost anything else.  On the other end of the spectrum, simply
getting fresh water and provisions was an adventure at some ports of
call.

Quantity of shipping does not need to be directly related to the
presence of construction and repair facilities.  I\'m quite sure that
there are some class A ports which get less traffic than a class D port
at a busy mining outpost.

Right.  But the Traveller port classifications measure not the amount of
the traffic, but the facilities available.  Therefore, Lockheed\'s plant
in California rates as a Class A airport, while Chicago\'s O\'hare rates
as a Class C (or Class B if someone has a fleet maintanance center
there).

On the other hand, especially in Traveller (like in sailing-ship days)
having a maintainance or construction center far from large
concentrations of shipping means unproductive delays.  Imagine a
merchant ship making a run; if the nearest maintainance center is two
jumps off of its route, that will mean *ANOTHER* four weeks of
unproductive time every year; someone who locates a maintainance
facility on the traderoute will certainly get *MUCH* more business.  The
same goes for ship construction.  Therefore, in Traveller, construction
and maintainance facilities will tend to indicate where the
concentrations of shipping are.  But there will be exceptions, and not
every high-traffic world will have a shipyard.  In many cases, one high
population or industrial world will import from and export to nearly
half a dozen resource, agricultural, or market worlds in the surrounding
area.  One or two class A or B starports will service all of this trade,
probably established where the ships tend to concentrate for
astrographic reasons, or where the skills or resources are readily
available (such as a high-tech industrial world).

I\'d argue that the main ingredent is not the resources or the technical
skill; both can be imported.  What is important is a location convenient
to your customer base.  As it usually works out, this typically means
on a resource world, or an industrial world (both popular destinations,
and able to supply some of the needs of a shipyard).

Large mineral deposits mean lots of cheap ore or processed products,
which means a large volume of trade.  Lots of ships means a good
opportunity for starship maintainance facilities, and even starship
construction yards.  Technicans and even pre-fabricated parts can be
shipped in if the demand warrants the expense.

They usually have enough facilities to do major repairs but not
enough to build craft although they could bolt together something 90%
complete from spares.

YES. BUT. What you want is highly processed/refined resources.

If you take this "association" to extremes you end up with all
computer manufacturers being located near large silicon deposits and
I don\'t think that is correct.

WRONG.  You want to locate yourself close to a steel producer and you
just stated that they are located near COAL reserves and not metal
deposits (OR are you just being generic with "mineral" deposits?).

You locate your business/industry as cost effectively as possible.
If you require more coal than oil or minerals then you position
the factories where you can get the items cost effectively.  This is
one of the reasons a lot of Earth companies are relocating to 3rd world
countries high in cheap labour.

Modern society (and future society) is governed by transportation
networks.  If you don\'t have good trans nets to your country then
you don\'t get what you need at reasonable prices.  Thats the case with
a lot of the starving 3rd world nations today.  Its not that there isn\'t
enough food to go around, its just not economical to ship it there.

What are the large aircraft builders close to?  Given the costs and
volume of material they process it is quite practical for them to
be located anywhere that they can get their staff, electronics and metal
alloys at competitive prices.  They don\'t have to locate next to a
steel works because they would sub-contract out the various components.

> Galliard is one of the main ship builders of Gamba.  The system has

So what your saying is that all the industry for refining these
asteroids into usable alloys is located in the asteroids as well?

I suppose that the facilities to refine the alloys into electronic
components and refrigerators etc is there as well?  This would
depend upon the cost of labour and other costs so it might be more
practical to drop the processed alloys to planetary surface for
secondary processing.

The Ancients were probably located here because it was the biggest
piece of flat ground for miles around and they liked playing lawn
bowls 8^}.

I didn\'t think engineers came in any other form. 8^}

> Virtually all the population is employed at the Galli-Yards, and at

Then who does the refining of alloys and building of electronic components
etc  or does your definition of a shipyard encompass all anciliary
manufacturing as well.  In effect having a closed environment?

Hello TMLers, in the last month I have twice managed to lose mail
connectivity from my site and then restore it. Such problems do make it
difficult to use my remote list manager software update the TML
addresses. Nonetheless, you all deserve an apology.

I have just updated the TML mail lists and would like to welcome several
TMLers back after an absence: Steve Owens, Colin Roald, Craig Waylan,
Chuck McKnight, Mark Arendt, and R Morris. I\'d also like to welcome
several members at changed addresses that (I hope) are working: Gerry
Williams, metlay, Marc Volovic, Scott Kellogg, Tim Soholt, Bill Smart,
Brandon Cope, Catie Helm, and Pedro Tavares. Lastly, let\'s all extend a
hearty new member welcome to Erik Yocum, Pablo Ruiz, and Martin Snow.

I also must admit that there seem to be problems with the TML biweekly
and bundle deliveries. I hope to look into these problems in the next
week and restore those listees.

Unburying myself,

James

Sand won\'t bother it THAT much.  And if you can get something that close,
then use a nuke instead.  It saves you time and trouble.  Keep in mind
that if you surround the ship with enough sand to keep it stationary
(about as much as the Sahara desert has, for a start), it STILL takes you
hours or days to reach the ship, and he can cruise out of your sand on
normal drive (which all S/W ships have), and bug out.

Why does ANYONE believe that TL3 worlds can feed a subsector?  TL3 countries

How many TL6 machine tools do we import into the USA?  How much precision
equipment?  At TL6, your idea of precision isn\'t even in the time zone
required for real precision work.  Total production is more than 100,000,000
tons annually?  So where do the exports come from?  The USA does more than
that, and we sure don\'t have 1,000,000,000 people in the USA!

I\'m finally back on for real!  Yippee!  And a big thank you to
2G Scott for forwarding me TMLs for the last six weeks  :-)
In addition, thanks for getting me back on, James.

In relation to the sector developement discussion, but somewhat
tangential to it, I\'d like to address what Scott 2G and Bruce
recently posted.  With regards to natural resources and the siting
of industries that rely on those resources, I have to agree with
Bruce: industries tend to be sited to minimize the largest costs
(which in the old and new world is labor and transportation).

Transportation really is very important.  Pittsburgh became an
industrial center, not because of it\'s proximity to coal deposits
but because it was (and still is) cheap to ship materials by barge
up the river.  The anthrositic and bituminous coal deposits of
Pennsylvania are distributed throughout that state, but the best
and most productive of those deposits are in the eastern, not western
half of the state.  The steel mills of Allentown and Bethleham are
actually better located than those of Pittsburgh, being close to
both good transportation (by rail and by river) and to the high-grade
anthrositic coal.

The steel mills of Gary, Indiana, are in a similar position.  Being
at the juncture of several railroads and also being right on Lake
Michigan, they could ship both coal from the east and west cheaply
by rail (and still do), and had the advantage of being able to get
Masabi Range taconite iron ore by barge and lake freighter.

Let\'s look at the fate of Kaiser Steel in California.  Eagle Mountain
is one of the only major high grade iron ore depostis of the western
US, but it\'s out in the middle of nowhere in the Corona Low Desert,
half way between Palm Springs and the Colorado River.  They actually
mined the ore, processed it, and milled it to steel nearby.  It was
then shipped by rail to LA.  It was expensive compared to the cost
of milling steel in the rust belt, but eastern steel must be shipped.
The overall cost of eastern steel was more expensive when the cost
of transportation was factored in.  For a while, a long time in fact,
Kaiser Steel in California was competitive.  Then, in the 60\'s and 70\'s,
the cost of rail transportation put Kaiser Steel out of business.  The
ore deposit of Eagle Mountain is still there, with millions of tons of
reserves left!

There\'s a place out in the high desert of Nevada on the other side of
the range from Imlay called the Nevada Iron Ore Mine.  It\'s one of
my favorite rock collecting spots, incidentally.  The deposit is
pure high-grade magnetite - lovely stuff, in a mafic emplacement
and some secondary enrichment of sulfides.  Lots of good rock, including
crystals of olivine, all in one spot.  (Is my rock fetish showing yet?
;-)

The Nevada Iron Ore Mine trucked the ore out of the basin, over the
range, to the rail stop of the Southern Pacific Railroad.  From there,
it was shipped over the Donner Pass and down to the port of Oakland.
When the costs of rail transportation climbed in the late 50\'s, the
Nevada Iron Ore Mine went out of business.

Let\'s look briefly at Mercury, a strategic mineral according to the
US Bureau of Mines.  The richest deposits of mercury in North America
are in the Coastal Ranges of California.  During WWII, all of the
Allies\' mercury production was from California (well, there was some
from Nevada too, but it was minor).  If you look at where these deposits
are located, though, they are not on any of the major transportation
lines.  In fact, most of them are damn hard to get to (I know, I\'ve
been to most of them).  But the price of mercury during the war made
it economic to mine mercury again in California.  After the war, most
of these deposits were abandoned, because cheap Spanish and Trieste
mercury was back on the market.  The only mercury mines still in
operation in Califonia are in the New Idria District, a place so hard
to get into (four hours drive from San Francisco on a horrible terrible
raod) that I\'ve only been there once (for a rock maniac like me, that\'s
damn little).  But the deposits in New Idria are so rich, that it\'s
still economic to mine them DISPITE the cost of transportation.

After much rambling, I think I\'ve managed to make my point that it\'s
transportation cost that drives the availability of resources.  I think
that regards to the siting of Class A starports with ship building
facilities, in-system transportation nets will develop to deliver
resource materials cheaply.

I\'d also like to throw out another concept, and that is the lack OR
the expense of a material is one of the things that drives the
development of new materials technology.  Eastern steel is a good
example of this.  When you drive around the east, one of the things
you notice is that the road infrastructure is based on steel:
overpasses,underpasses, bridges and viaducts have steel superstructures.
Now go to the west coast: one of the first things an easterner will notice
is that concrete is the material used in most of the infrastructure.
Pre-stressed concrete is vastly cheaper to construct when compared to
the cost of eastern steel.  Because of the cost of steel on the west
coast, most all of the advances in concrete engineering (prestressed
structure, in-place pored piles, light-weight high-strength concretes)
were made in California in the 1960\'s.  An entire specialty of
engineering was developed because steel was too expensive to ship.

So what happens when your belters mine out all the high grade ores
in your asteroid belt, or when the cost of processing lower grade
ores plus transportation costs make your shipyard\'s materials too
expensive?  I think there are two answers.  First, your shipyard
becomes uncompetitive and is downgraded to being a reapir facility
(because people will go elsewhere to buy their ships).  Second, your
engineers get their collective act together and develop a new materials
technology for constructing ships, one which exploits a previously
unused abundant material that\'s in-system.

Let\'s look briefly at the siting of major industries.  They are all
near or at the nexi of transportation nets.  Lockheed gets its materials
by rail from the port of Los Angeles (which is actually in Long Beach).
Boeing gets its materials by ship from the Port of Seattle.  Electric
Boat shipyard in Groton, Connecticut nowadays receives the cylindrical
pieces of submarine hull for the 688 class and the Tridents by
ocean-going barge from the pre-fabrication facility at Quonset Point,
Rhode Island, which in turn receives the raw steel by ocean-going barge
from either Pennsylvania or from the Great Lakes steel mills.  Small
components for the boats come by truck, on interstate 95.  Medium-sized
stuff, like missile hatches and reactor vessels, come by rail (every
little kid in Groton knows what a reator vessel looks like on a flat
bed rail car!  ;-)

The point is that the history
of industrial revolutions is one which driven by transportation systems.
The 19th century industrial centers of the northeast were all connected
by water, either by river, lake, ocean, or canal.  When rail came into
the equation, some industrial centers developed at the nexus of rail
lines and major waterways, like Chicago and St. Louis.  The industrial
centers of the 57th century will develop at the nexi of transportation
nets, both in-system and interstellar.  Regardless of how sectors are
generated, there should be a good reason for the siting of a class A
starport, either because the cost of in-systems materials are cheap, or
because that starport is at the junction of several insterstellar trade
routes.

}YES. BUT. What you want is highly processed/refined resources.

Sure, but what you need to GET those processed/refined resources is
the Raw materials which are minerals and technolgy.

Computers don\'t really require all that much silicon do they?
Ships however need large quantities of metals.  Those metals had to
come from somewhere.  It\'s a lot easier to have the metals in
system than it is to haul em in.

}WRONG.  You want to locate yourself close to a steel producer &
}you just stated that they are located near COAL reserves & not
}metal deposits (OR are you just being generic with "mineral"
}deposits?).

I sincerely doubt that TL 9+ industries will have coal furnaces to
make their alloys.  By \'minerals\' I was referring to the raw
materials necessary to build starships.  Other than lanthanum we
don\'t know for certain what those are.  What\'s superdense?

}What are the large aircraft builders close to?  Given the costs &
}volume of material they process it is quite practical for them to
}be located anywhere that they can get their staff, electronics &
}metal alloys @ competitive prices.  They don\'t have to locate next
}to a steel works because they would sub-contract out the various
}components.

Well, I\'ll tell ya, If I was running a shipping yard, I wouldn\'t
want to have to subcontract to a company in another SOLAR SYSTEM.

>Galliard is one of the main ship builders of Gamba. The system has
>a rich asteroid belt with several drydock asteroids.

}So what your saying is that all the industry for refining these
}asteroids into usable alloys is located in the asteroids as well?

With a diameter of only 1600 km, Galliard is practically an
asteroid itself.  The mineral extraction is going on all over the
system.  You can do that pretty easy at TL 14.

}I suppose that the facilities to refine the alloys into electronic
}components & refrigerators etc is there as well?  This would
}depend upon the cost of labour & other costs so it might be more
}practical to drop the processed alloys to planetary surface for
}secondary processing.

Not all vessels can land.  Imagine trying to \'land\' a Tigress class
dreadnought?  500,000 tons?  :-P  I doubt the hull has any stress
points for landing.  Zero G dockyards are nice.  Say the upstation
class A starport is one or more of these drydocks.

>Virtually all the population is employed @ the Galli-Yards

}Then who does the refining of alloys & building of electronic

}all anciliary manufacturing as well.  In effect having a closed

Yep.  The materials, refining etc etc are subdivisions of
Galli-Yards.

}Well, from the Traveller rules, there is not much "official" difference
}between Class A, B, & C ports *EXCEPT* the availability of shipyards
}for construction & repair.  By extension, the class A & B ports have
}more traffic, as both a cause & an effect of their repair and
}construction facilities.


Class C ports don\'t even have refined fuel available.

>Point being, that the ship building yards may not always mean there
>is a large port or a large amount of traffic going in & out.

}Right.  But the Traveller port classifications measure not the amount of
}the traffic, but the facilities available.  Therefore, Lockheed\'s plant
}in California rates as a Class A airport, while Chicago\'s O\'hare rates
}as a Class C (or Class B if someone has a fleet maintanance center
}there).

Chicago\'s O\'Hare is class C?  No bloody way!  Class C means unrefined
fuel and \'reasonable\' repair facilities.  No overhauls, no 100 hr
inspections.  To me, that means that the port is more like your local
airstrip.  (Say College Park airstrip for the DC & MD crowd)
Small private planes VERY small commercial stuff.  Class D is more
like a grass strip airport, with MAYBE a hanger.   Class E is a
farmer\'s field.

}Therefore, in Traveller, construction
}and maintainance facilities will tend to indicate where the
}concentrations of shipping are.

But remember, that the concentrations of shipping will tend to be where
the technology and industry are, which is where the raw materials are.
Thus shipyards attract shipping, and shipping attracts shipyard building.

World A has lots of natural resources readily adaptable for ship
building.
People come in to develop those resources.  The traffic starts
coming in.
Ship building starts.  Now ship traffic starts POURING in.

>Ok, now with economics still working that way, Ship yards need to

}Large mineral deposits mean lots of cheap ore or processed products,
}which means a large volume of trade.  Lots of ships means a good
}opportunity for starship maintainance facilities, & even starship
}construction yards.  Technicans & even pre-fabricated parts can be
}shipped in if the demand warrants the expense.

Yeah, so maybe not all the mineral resources go to making starships.
The main exports (other than ships) would be refined materials.

}The name "Galli-Yard" is a little silly, but OK so far.

You mean that with all the OTHER silly musical names in Gamba sector
I can\'t add one more?  Why don\'t we have a balkanized planet named
Guitar?  With the nations Fender, Gibson, and Danelectro?  Maybe a

A band of terrorists have destroyed the Weelkes starport shipyards when
they hijacked the bulk carrier Dulcet Melody.  The Dulcet Melody\'s
transponder suddenly switched to 7600 shortly after liftoff indicating
a hijack attempt.  When the tower attempted to contact the Dulcet Melody,
they heard gunshots over the radio.  Shortly afterward, the 10,000 ton
bulk carrier crashed in the Weelkes shipyard facility.  All traffic
control was lost at that moment, however there was the unconfirmed
tracking by the scoutship Cello of the Dulcet Melody\'s ship\'s boat
departing prior to the crash.
     There have been acusations by Weelkes government officials that
the terrorists were backed by Madrigal.  Madrigal has denied any

How about TL 8 spacecraft with TL 9 jumpdrives?
Personally, I *LIKE* the stuff with low tech spacecraft.  One of my
favorite (unused) ideas was a TL 8 starship.  A company had gotten a
hold of the original Hiver jump drive plans.  As such, they built a
fleet of starships at TL 8.  Problem was that the Jump drives often
melted down.  Thus ships had to have several backup drives.  And
remember, we\'re talking book 2 rules of construction here.  So, it
wouldn\'t be too hard.

I also notice that they added in a Dyson Sphere into the Imperium.  Bad
move.  They describe it as "several sectors away".  If the ship had been
drifting for 3500 years, and covered 90 parsecs (less than three secotrs),
then it was going 0.084c.  Which is 29+ days at 1G.  Nice number, but the

Dyson sphere is close by.  This should be the most significant event in

Make fun of me at your peril, sonny boy. Make fun of my Xpander and
you\'ve had it. |-> Besides, following your Guitar model, that world
would be named Oberheim. Which has a nice ring to it, but....

My two cents\' worth on the "let\'s do it ourselves" idea is simple:
I don\'t think it can be done. Witness TDR.

People have too many divergent opinions and are too willing to argue
down into the level of the trivial without agreeing on generalities to
ever produce an alternative to what\'s published by GDW. People are on
this group because they love to talk and to argue, more so than to
listen.  Some people believe that all we need is a new scenario in
which to run our Traveller campaigns. Others believe that the rules
need to be overhauled. Everyone is so fond of pushing their knowledge
of specific social or physical sciences that no idea can get off the
ground without getting shot full of holes. The end result is that a
lot of noise gets made and a lot of ground gets churned up, but no
one actually GETS anywhere. (Kind of like a tractor pull....) You
can\'t write an RPG by committee. Marc Miller had a lot of holes in
his background, but he got Traveller up and going because he didn\'t
have to argue with anyone. As long as you have a few dedicated
writers, a lot of scathing but unconstructive critics, and a mass of
lazy jackasses howling for changes they\'re unwilling to work for,
you shouldn\'t expect a miracle.

I will state my opinion for the record, and then bow out of this
discussion for good. We should keep the existing rules we\'re used to
using-- for some, that\'ll be Classic Trav, for others MT, for still
others homebrew variants (TDR being only one of many), for others TNE
when it comes out (ah, the need to be current), and for still others
completely different rules systems (I know of people running the
Imperium universe in GURPS, Space Opera, and even AD&D). We could
then, as an intellectual enterprise, write the equivalent of a GURPS
sourcebook, based on the simple premise that Strephon never died. But
I predict that this won\'t get any farther than an argument over
whether the first new historical item should be the declaration of a
new Emperor in Ilelish (assuming Dulinor tried and failed) or
something else (assuming he never tried).

People will accuse me of cynicism and of being a "wet blanket." Well,
maybe. But everyone seems to be in the habit of getting all fired up
about these grand designs and then suffering major letdowns when they
go flat; I think we should enjoy doing things on a small scale, like
Gamba, and enjoy the victories of which we ARE capable. I believe that
if a Strephon-never-died book for GDW is ever going to get written and
published successfully, it\'ll be done by one person with one vision.

     Tuerz was out on point again, the group strung out along the
corridor to the robotics lab.
     Suddenly, klaxun began to blare.  "Battle stations!  Battle
stations!  All hands to battle stations!  This is no drill!
Repeat, this is no drill!  Unidentified vessels approaching.
     "Gun crews man your stations.  Crews man your fighters.  Stand

     Jietlshaiepr clenched her fist.  "Miakr?  You still linked in
the computer?"
     Miakr checked the stolen hand computer.  "Hold on...  Looks
like six ships... two one thousand tonners... two eight hundred

Broadsword class cruisers...  The other two look like scouts...

     Shtam frowned.  "The Domain of Alentzar doesn\'t have

     "Then who..."
     Jietlshaiepr drew a sharp breath, "League of Suns ships...

     Niedrsha and Jiet caught each other\'s eye.  "Lieutenant Jones

     Miakr shook his head.  "Not for long.  These guys will blow
them out of the sky."
     "What?"
     "These guys got some damn good sensors...  I doubt tech twelve
stuff can get through their countermeasures.  They\'re gonna get

     "Can you patch into commo?"
     Miakr thought for a second.  "No.  The account I\'m in has no
authorization for communications."
     Kfoks pushed the computer down and growled.  "With a Tilly, we
won\'t need authorization.  Let\'s go."
                             - XLI -
     A figure in combat armor with a gauss gun stood motionless
outside the lab.  Tuerz and Kfoks listened carefully from around
the junction of a T in the corridor.
     "Another robot?" asked Kfoks.
     Tuerz didn\'t look back, "Probably."
     "Remember, the brain is in the lower abdomen." Kfoks checked
the gauss rifle, lighting the laser designator.
     Tuerz eyed the deadly noisemaker "What the Grrshak are you
going to do with that?"
     "Cover you."
     "Grah, well don\'t.  You fire that thing and they\'ll all know
where we are."
     Tuerz caressed his laser pistol and crouched down close to the
floor.  Never fire from where they expect...
     Like quicksilver, Tuerz flowed around the corner and squeezed
off three rapid shots.  The acrid smell of vaporized metal filled
the corridor as metal plates from the armor fell with a clatter.
     Tuerz finger tensed on the trigger as he assessed damage to
his target.
     The armored figure brought its gauss rifle half way up before
the servos froze up.  For a moment it swayed and then toppled,
crashing to the floor in a two hundred and fifty kilo crunch that
echoed down the corridor.
     In a flash, Tuerz was down the hall.  He flew to the side of
the door and waited as Kfoks ran to the other side.
     Kfoks head swiveled.  He grabbed the gauss rifle from the
corpse and threw it down the corridor to Kaezorr.  She and Niedrsha
covered the rear.
     Kfoks hand went to the door switch, "You hit high.  I\'ll hit
low.  GO!"
     The door slid open and Kfoks dove through firing.  Six figures
turned and two dove for cover.  Combat environment suits came
forward.  Kfoks gauss rifle volleyed and thundered.
     Tuerz fired from around the door.  His right hand shone X-rays
while his left hand jumped with the recoil of teflon coated
caseless.
     The figures in armor were unarmed.  One grabbed a crowbar and
came after Kfoks.  A burst of gauss needles took the arm with the
crowbar off at the elbow.  It kept coming.
     Tuerz flicked his laser over the robots head.  It burst into
flame as liquid hydrogen fuel spilled and then exploded.
     The burning robot was smashed to the floor by the blast.
Flaming wreckage flew about the room narrowly missing Kfoks.
Blazing, boiling liquid hydrogen flowed across the floor.  A fire
alarm sounded.
     Suddenly, the door to the room began to close.  Still firing,
Tuerz dove through.  The robots continued forward.
     Kfoks slammed a heavy burst into the lower chest of one of his
attackers.  The needles narrowly missed the brain but disabled the
transmission.  It fell, but still crawled toward him.
     Smoke and fog began to fill the room as the fire control
system began spewing carbon dioxide.
     Tuerz concentrated his firepower on his next target.  The
laser swept across its face to blind it while he sought out it\'s
brain with armor piercing slugs.  It fell with a crash.
     Kfoks chewed a robots brain to bits as he stitched gauss
needles through it\'s kevlar cloth.
     The fifth robot grabbed a crate to hurl it at Kfoks.
     Tuerz shot its feet out from under it.
     A bark from Kfoks rifle sent the last robots head off into a
corner leaking flame.  It wandered around trying to find its
target.
     The downed robot began the slow process of picking itself up
when Tuerz sent a single slug through its back.  It froze.  The
crawling robot was dispatched equally easily as the headless robot
careened around the room blind and deaf in the rising fog the
automatic fire extinguishers.
     The flames of the hydrogen fuel flicked low as the oxygen in
the room was displaced.
     Tuerz turned for the door and punched the door release.  The
door didn\'t budge.  "Door\'s locked!"
     Kfoks felt his breath growing short.  "Grab a tilly!"
     The Tillys stood on a large grav pallet along with Vole and
the other robots.
     Tuerz pounded on the door and howled.
     Gasping for breath, Kfoks trotted across the room and slung
his rifle onto his Tilly\'s arm.  With his head swimming he climbed
in and hit the hatch close.  The plates of armor swung into
position and closed him in.  A moment later, fresh air began
pumping in.  The systems came slowly on line and he dropped off the
pallet and clumped over to the door.
     Tuerz lay slumped on the floor choking and gasping for breath.
     Quickly, Kfoks put the arm of the Tilly through the door and
proceeded to rip it from the wall.  He gently picked up his
murderous friend from the floor and carried him into the corridor.
Free of the smoke and back in the air, Tuerz took gulping breaths
of the recycled air of Zylath.
     Seeing Tuerz slowly recovering, Kfoks headed back into the
lab.  Carefully, he activated the two remaining Tillys and slaved
their control to his own.  Soon the three of them managed to carry
the nearly 400 kilos of deactivated Vole out into the air of the
corridor.
     Kfoks checked over the weapons status of the battle suit.
Gauss rifle... RAM grenade launcher... fusion gun...  Weapon
systems reported themselves in, all green.  Kfoks tail waved in its
armored confinement.  Now the odds were just a little more even...
     He went back into the lab to retrieve the PPO2 warbots.
			- XLII -
     Aboard the Neuevo Australia, the sensor officer called out.
"Captain Stuart, we\'ve got a message comin\' in from the surface
fer the Lieutenant Jones...  Oh wait...  We\'re losing it...  It\'s
gone.  Captain, it was a warning.
     "Call him to the bridge.  And Ensign Smith as well."  Stuart
rolled his eyes at the brilliance of Naval Intelligence with it\'s
operatives.  This was Supposed to be a Covert mission!
     A moment later, the two intelligence officers came onto the
bridge.
     "Mr. Ramsey, replay that message you picked up."
     "Aye, sir."
     A screech of static played out and then "Attention
starships.  This is Taek Kfoks.  If you\'ve got Lieutenant Jones
up there, we\'ve found your target for you.  You\'re headed into a
trap.  Theirsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss..."
     "Lost the signal at that point.  Could be jamming.  The
signal was awfully low."
     "Friends of yours, Mr. Jones?" asked the Captain.
     "Not really sir, but if it is \'o he sez, they\'re not
enemies."
     "Recommendations?"
     "Can you locate the source o\' the jamming?"
     "Ah think so, sir."
     Smith and Jones exchanged glances, "Then hit it.  We know
thure\'s a pirate base in this system, we just dun\'t know whare."
     "Thot\'s an act of war!" objected Ramsey.
     "We are *already* at war with these pirates." observed
Smith.  And if there is a military installation down thare it\'s
in violation of treaty."
     "Very well... Gunnery officer, prepare to fire.  Flight
crews prepare for launch.  Signal the New Zealand to prepare to
launch fighters.  I want the marines on Battleaxe and Machete
ready to drop.  Have the scouts Burke and the Shaw maintain high
guard position."
     "Jones, you\'d better be right."
                            - XLIII -
     The Tilly lurched silently over the vacuum plain of Zylath.
The G-Carrier was closing in on it\'s position.  The armored
figure dove behind a rock escarpment as the range narrowed.  An
eerie red light suddenly lit the rock melting away sections of it
as the laser burned through.
     The Tilly dodged around the other side of the rock and
sprayed fusing plasma into it\'s opponent.  The plasma flared
silently lighting up the shadows of the grey dusty rocks.  It
drilled a hole through the bottom of the G-Carrier and ripped a
section of the roof off from the inside.
     Miraculously, it stayed aloft with its hull glowing red and
other spots dripping molten superdense.  Slowly, it began to
climb and the laser turned to bear on the concealed figure.  A
second bolt of plasma streaked out to lick the underside of the
startled G-Carrier.  The plasma nosed through the hull in search
of something interesting.  It spattered against the fusion plant
ripping open the containment vessel and loosing the plasma
within.  Twenty six megawatts of hydrogen plasma streamed out
into the crew compartment of the G-Carrier.
     The G-Carrier\'s ascent slowed as the power and direction
ceased their input to the grav modules.  It flew in a classic
newtonian parabolic arc in the vacuum and low gravity of Zylath.
It rose slowly and gracefully as it silently tumbled over and
then began a slow drop to the surface.
     It rotated slowly upside down as it reached lazily for the
ground.  The remnants of the roof hit first and crumbled under
the weight of the hundred ton grav vehicle.  It silently buried
itself in the soft gray dust.
                            - XLIV -
     Five Swordfish and five Swordfish II\'s nosed away from the
Neuevo Australia and formed up with the two squadrons of the New
Zealand around the cutters from the Battleaxe and Machete.  The
patrol cruiser scanned the surface for the source of the jamming.
It seemed to be coming from a large number of sources spread over
the surface of the planet frustrating attempts to just lock on
one source hostile electronic countermeasures.
     Ramsey pointed to the captain\'s holotank, "Sir!  Picking up
a large neutrino source deep below the planet\'s surface...  Looks
like a big plant powering up."
     Stewart frowned.  "Helm, evasive maneuver sequence juliet.
Weapons officer, sand casters free.  Attention all ships, begin
evasive maneuvers, defensive systems free.  Redirect laser
systems power to engines."
     Ramsey continued, "Could be something big...  five hundred
megawatts and rising...  One gigawatt and rising...  Five
gigawatts and still rising...
     Stewart growled.  "Flight leaders, begin EMS-Jamming.  Get
those marines down."
     The EMS-Jammers of the fighters screamed up and down the
spectrum to fend off any active radar systems.  But the passive
sensors of the pirates were not the least disturbed.
     "Ten gigawatts and still rising...  Fifteen gigawatts...
Holding steady at fifteen gigawatts."
     A stream of neutral particles came screaming at the Neuevo
Australia.  It licked away at her stern and etched away at the
engines.  The radiation leaked through the hull and began
blasting away at her sand caster batteries.
     "Damage report!" called Stewart, "Mr. Ramsey, did we get a
lock on that firing station?"
     "Umm... No sir!  The rad sensors got swamped:  particle
accelerator.  Scanning for it..."
     "Damage to maneuver drive!  Acceleration down to 3G\'s...
sand caster battery two is out of action!"
     Stewart\'s jaw set in anger, "Damage control procedures.
Engineering get those drives back up."
     "Sir!  We\'re picking up some sort of a fire fight on the
surface.  Lasers and a fusion gun."  Ramsey flicked the sensor
display to a closeup of the surface of Zylath.  Briefly he
replayed the little fireworks display between the Tilly and the
G-Carrier.
     Stewart frowned "Well, someone is fighting down there... god
knows who\'s side they\'re on."
     Lt. Jones frowned at the holodisplay.  "Sir, I b\'lieve that
th\' armored figger down there\'s... *not* our enemy.  It\'s \'im who
signaled us."
     "Mister Jones, do you have any idea *who* the enemy is?"
     "Sir," called Ramsey, "Picking up two small craft now.  Ten
ton range...  Look to be fighters.  I make them out to be
Shtelfires.  Closing in on the fire fight we picked up..."
                             - VL -
     Kfoks lumbered back toward the dome.  The G-Carrier was
finished, he didn\'t care to stick around to find out what would
follow it.  Suddenly, the threat warning alarm went off in his
ears.  Instantly, he dropped to the ground and scanned for the
danger.
     Several kilometers away, heavy lasers were melting the
ground.  The even at that distance, three gigawatts of visible
wavelength laser speckle is a bright and deadly eyesore.  The
lasers slashed about as though seeking a target.  They were
rapidly approaching his position.
     A voice sounded in his helmet breaking through the jamming,
"Vampire!  Vampire!  Vampire!"
     Suddenly, there was a series of tiny flashes up in the sky
as the lasers found a small flying target.
                             - IVL -
     "Missiles intercepted, Sir."  called Ramsey.  "Kangaroo
squadron is closing on the Shtels."
     Jones studied the Holodisplay.  "Did ye get through to \'im
on the radio?"
     "Don\'t know, Sir.  His transmitter must not be as strong as
ours.  He might be able to read us, but we\'ll never hear him over
the jamming."
     "But we can still communicate..."  Jones keyed the
transmitter.  "Kfoks?  This is Jones.  If you can\'t signal us by
radio, les see a blast from that fusion gun of yers..."
     Ramsey interrupted, "Sir!  New Zealand reports a hit on
their maneuver drive!"
     "Did they get a lock on the particle accelerator?"
     "Negative, sir it\'s too well collimated."
     "Anything on the densitometer?"
     "Still chewing on it sir."
     Stewart turned on Jones and Smith.  "If your \'not enemy\'
down there doesn\'t give us the intelligence we need we\'re going
to have to pull it out of here.  Fast."

     Kfoks didn\'t know Morse, but it took a few microseconds for
the Neuevo Australia\'s computer to find a translation program for
Gdekgveg as Kfoks hammered away with the Tilly\'s laser welder.
     "Whare in hell is that gun?" demanded Jones.
     -B-A-S-E-L-O-C-A-T-I-O-N-O-L-D-F-I-G-H-T-E-R-B-A-S-E-U-N-E-

O-P-
     Smith turned to Ramsey, "Concentrate sensor scans on the ol\'
fighter base.  Mayn\'t be as dead as reports say."
     "Aye, Ma\'am...  Hold on just a sec...  Getting something...
GOT IT!  Target located, data passing on the bus to fire
control."
     Captain Stewart grinned for the first time since they exited
jump.  "Commence firing on that target.  Pass data link to the
task force."
     Three gigawatts of laser energy began licking away at the
shore batteries.
     "Permission to load nuclear rounds sir?"
     "Mr. Ramsey, how close is our forward observer?"
     "Too close, Captain.  He\'s less than a kilometer away."
     "Belay nuclear rounds."
     As the lasers picked away at the uncovered particle
accelerator, Shtelfires began swarming out like angry wasps from
a flaming nest.  The Swordfish leapt to engage.
     "Looks like twenty Shtels rising to engage our fighters."
     "Then it\'s even odds.  Maintain laser fire on the shore
batteries until you\'re certain they\'re out of action.  Missile
batteries commence targeting enemy fighters."
                            - IIIL -
     The two robots caught them off guard.  With a staccato bark,
they opened up with ACR\'s as the Rackan rounded the corner in the
Tilly.  Sabots pounded on the heavy armor of the Tilly ringing it
like a bell beaten by a burning spastic.
     "AMBUSH!" shouted Niedrsha.
     Rackan reacted instantly.  A long burst of gauss needles
rang out adding to the din.  The first robot shook wildly under
the impacts while the second turned to run.  The first caught
three needles in its brain and froze like a statue before
toppling to the ground.
     Tuerz took off after the fleeing robot.  He turned the
corner and caught sight of it.  With a quick shot he grazed its
fuel tank.  Liquid hydrogen spewed from the tank sheathing the
robot in flame.
     It continued running.
     Tuerz sensitive ears picked up the sound of approaching
feet...  Many approaching feet.  He skidded to a stop and
backtracked to the group.  Miakr was puzzling over the ACR when
he found them.  "More coming."
     Jietlshaiepr nodded, "Let\'s move people.  Miakr, send the
PPO2\'s to fight rearguard. Tuerz, Vole on point.  Kaezorr, Rackan
cover the rear.  Move *Fast*!"
     Tuerz ran by Miakr and flicked the safety on the ACR off.
He sneered at the longarm.  "Clumsy weapon.  No style.  No grace.
Point it and shoot it."
                             - IIL -
     The PPO2\'s closed in on the sound of approaching feet.  The
robots took position at the intersection of two corridors and
waited for the approach.  Silently, they hung suspended out of
sight as their targets entered the corridor shooting gallery.
     On a quick burst radio signal, the fire team uncovered
itself to open fire.  One warbot exposed itself fully while the
others remained under cover taking firing instructions from the
first.
     Two of the targets were cut down by laser fire before they
could respond.  Four millimeter sabots stitched tiny holes in the
light superdense armor of the exposed PPO2.
     The PPO2\'s continued to methodically cut down their targets
managing to drop three more before the exposed PPO2 took a hit in
the brain that dropped it to the floor with a loud two hundred
eighty nine kilogram crash.
     A second PPO2 rotated to expose itself to the withering fire
from the targets.
     One of the targets was hit in the fuel tank.  Liquid
hydrogen leaked for a millisecond before it touched on the molten
metal of the robot converting the fuel tank into a flame thrower.
The jet of the newly formed hydrogen torch cut into the robot\'s
fuel cell which instantly exploded.
     Four of the PPO2\'s targets were flattened by the blast and
shrapnel took the arm off of the exposed warbot.
     New orders came in on the PPO2\'s command circuit:  "Withdraw
and lead the targets off."
     The PPO2\'s moved down the side corridor continuing to draw
fire from their targets.

Maybe they _are_ treated as slaves.  Perhaps *THIS* is the true nature
and source of the virus...the Cymbiots are taking revenge and freeing
themselves from an oppressive slavery.

Maybe they _are_ treated as slaves.  Perhaps *THIS* is the true nature
and source of the virus...the Cymbiots are taking revenge and freeing
themselves from an oppressive slavery.

See, the Imperium wasn\'t totally stupid for creating a computer virus that
destroyed their culture...they were totaly stupid for making slaves of a race
that could DIRECTLY affect the single aspect of their culture that was
responsible for keeping their culture intact (i.e. their computers).  This
slave race was the one who created the virus and furthermore, they could not
be detected or prevented from doing so.

There are a couple of points that need discussion...

1.  What took them (the Cymbiots) so long to rebel?
    A.  Perhaps the conditions they worked under only got bad recently?
    B.  Perhaps it took them this long to spread the rebellion plan among
        all or most of the Cymbiot occupied ships?

2.  Since I never planned on using the virus idea, I never paid any attention
    to the details of it.  How did ship-based chips feed this virus into
    planet-based systems which would NEVER need to interface with the ship
    systems anyway?

3.  Could the Cymbiots have sparked off the Rebellion?  Here\'s how I see it
    could have happened....

    If the Cymbiots can indeed interface with planet-based systems (see #2),
    then they inserted news stories about the assasination of Strephon in all
    the planetary news services they contact.  These stories would be complete
    in all details, including the fact that Dulinor assassinated the emperor
    and assumed the Iridium Throne.  In fact neither Dulinor nor the emperor
    were on Capitol at the time.  Strephon was away on a secret vacation
    (even emperors, *especially* emperors need vacations), while Dulinor was
    in transit back to his home from a visit to the capitol.  Notice both
    principals are out of touch.

    When the twins hear the news one assassinates the other (rats, I can\'t
    remember their names) for whatever reason, things like this happen all the
    time 8+)

    Dulinor hears that Strephon has been assassinated and it has been
    attributed to him (mistakenly, he believes).  He goes along with it,
    because it is a lucky accident and he thinks he can do a better job anyway.
    After Strephon speaks up, he can\'t back down or disclaim something he has
    already publicly claimed.  Nor can he claim it was mistaken identity
    because he has already made some statements concerning the subject.

    Meanwhile Strephon has heard that he has been assassinated by D.  He also
    believes it is a case of mistaken identity, in this instance the
    victim was mistakenly identified as Strephon.

    One thing leads to another and the Rebellion happens as already outlined
    by GDW.  However, it was all triggered by the Cymbiots in order to
    create a chaotic situation wherein their own rebellion has a better
    chance of success.

No doubt this scenario has problems which some of you will proceed to point
out to me...8+), but hey, it *could* have happened that way.

Ya, I agree with this, water is not a taint or Earth would certainly be
considered to have a tainted atmos.  Here in central Pennsylvania, we get
lots of humidity also (where it comes from, I don\'t know, unless it drifts
down the 125 miles from lake Erie).

Metlay made some very astute observations about the concept
of TML getting together and doing a game.  I\'d like to comment
a bit on what he said.

The chaos that ensued when TDR was formed (ah, but it was fun...)
was a demonstration of why committees are bad business.
I got the distinct impression, however, that despite the
failure in general there were a lot of people with talent
and energy at that time.

A subset of the TDR group could easily do a complete game
system if they wanted.  The TDR group contained many more
highly talented game design people than the average game
company.  The problem isn\'t talent, but too much of it;
TDR was open and had a lot of people, where a successful
project would have to be more selective, not for talent
but for ability to work together and constructively
criticize.  We\'ve seen several successful small scale
collaborations here, the trick is to take them as the
lesson and generalize a bit 8-)

\'Fraid he\'s right folx.  I\'ve seen a lotta projects on the TML die
off because there was a lack of a shared vision on how it was all
to work.

Metlay sed:
}I think we should enjoy doing things on a small scale, like
}Gamba, & enjoy the victories of which we ARE capable.

As a matter of fact, the only project I\'ve seen live all the way
through was The Horde.  That had 3 motivated people.  It started
with Rob\'s ideas, some collaberation, then I cranked out the
designs which Rob approved.  Metlay did the story by hisself.

The reason I think that Gamba is gonna work is because we got
Rob out there who stated from the start \'This is not a democracy\'.

Look, we all as GM\'s are very different.  We have our strong points
where we can go to town.  Mine is physics and to a certain extent,
military hardware (craft design).  But you put me in economics or
some other area, and Steve and Wildstar will walk all over me.
I\'m certian our campaigns reflect this.  Me?  I barely ever use
the economics stuff in Trav.  I don\'t think I\'ve read the full Trade
and Commerce rules.  Mark and Eric can tell you what they think of my
knowlege of psych and bio stuff.  Well, I know those are my weak
points and I stay away from \'em.

So the areas where I\'m weak, I use more simplitic rules than others
more competant in that area would.

Ya know, what *I\'d* like to see on the TML would be some stuff on what
I *DON\'T* know.  I\'d *LOVE* to see some Trade & Commerce stuff that
makes sences and works.

I\'d *LOVE* to see some bio stuff in it all.

Computer stuff.
Geology stuff.
Chemistry stuff.

All kinds of stuff worked out by folx who *KNOW WHAT THEY\'RE
TALKING ABOUT*.  Like George\'s Watercraft design stuff.

So, while I\'m out here, lemme ask a few folx who seem to know
where their heads are at a few questions:

Mark, Richard, James:  How do you handle computers, robots and
AI in Trav?

Steve, Wildstar:  How would you handle trade and commerce from the
point of view of a bunch of jokers in a free trading starship?

Mark, Eric (Loren Wiseman?  You there?):  You ever come up with
something on Bio?

Catie:  How do you handle rock knocking in Trav?

Rob:  How do you handle chemisty stuff in Trav?

Metlay:  How do you handle Rock & Roll in Trav?  :-)

Ok, I aien\'t no mineralogist.  I\'ze just a down home research tech.
So\'s maybe I aien\'t got no rocks in me head...

But here\'s what I were envisionin\' fer Galliard.

The system is heavy in terms of mineral resources.  Specifically
the resources needed to build ships.  There also was (at the time
of the initial survey before any exploitation) an ancient site.
That site drew the scientists and the Navy.  The resources drew
miners.  The when the ancient site was worked over, the scientists
turned their attention to the miners and the mining co-operatives.

Kaboom.  Thy work together, and the Naval Architects and Engineers
and Miners all decide to put on a show in their uncle\'s barn.
They got materials, processing equipment, and high tech stuff.  All
the making\'s of a ship yard.  Transports cheap, all the stuff is in
system.

}generated, there should be a good reason for the siting of a
}class A starport, either because the cost of in-systems materials
}are cheap, or because that starport is @ the junction of several

How \'bout both?  Good materials, and the fact that Galliard *is* on
the X-Boat route.  :-)

Steve\'s right on the mark with this one, although I will note that TL3
is roughly 1700-1860 by my classic Traveller guidlelines.  I don\'t really
think that Motet will be feeding the subsector, or even Madrigal.  I do
think that they may have sufficient food to export, although I expect that
the exports would concentrate on high value foods of various sorts rather
than bulk grain.  Real world analogies would include bananas, coffee, and
alcoholic beverages as examples.

This brings up one of those sticky points about Traveller, which we are all
aware of, and which we all have different ways of dealing with:

WHAT IS TECH LEVEL?

I tend toward the "sustainable with local resources" description rather than
the "maximum level  to be found for sale" description, so it would not be too
unreasonable to think that some farming on Motet is carried on with the assist-
ance of TL6 farm equipment from Madrigalan factories, which are either repaired
by Madrigalan technicians using imported parts when they break down, or perhaps
simply scrapped....

Right.  Very soon, I\'ll have heard enough ideas about Gamba subsector
world descriptions, and I\'ll start talking about adventures....
But in the meantime, anybody with a drastically different interpretation
of any of the worlds is encouraged to speak up!

I could do with a bit of that too....

I don\'t.  It\'s easy.  I\'ve considered the question of basing an adventure
around a chemical engineering problem, but have not been able to come up
with a reasonable framework that would be accessible to most players and not
too boring.

I\'ll thank you not to modernize my instrument any more than necessary.  The

You\'re welcome to your disagreement, Scott, but I\'m with Wildstar on this
one.  It hasn\'t come up in my campaigns much, but I\'d rule that you could
get repairs or overhauls at an A or B low tech starport at some inflated
price and consider the tech level of the repair parts and so forth to be
equivalent to that of the nearest "reasonable supplier" world.  This would
be a floating scale, of course, with someplace like Glisten in the Spinward
Marches almost certainly dominating its subsector.

> Class C ports don\'t even have refined fuel available.

You\'re right about that, Scott, but with High Guard added to Book 2 we get
the fuel purifier.  Once you have that rule, Steve Higginbotham has demon-
strated that it never makes sense to have a ship which is not equipped with
one, making the availability of refined fuel a bit of a moot point.  The
only idfferences between starports that we are left with then is their
repair and support facilities.  And to add fuel to the fire, consider that
any typical modern airport would count as a reasonable starport in Traveller--
a type D or E at least.  With a fuel purifier, all you need is a hard pad to
land on and a water hose to top off the fuel tanks. (-:

I think you may be right, but possibly not. Half a year ago I solicited
help in developing a true frontier (as in: The PCs are the first people
of the Imperium who\'s been here) in the sectors immidiately spinward of
Spinward Marches (Beyond, Foreven and Vanguard Reaches). It didn\'t get
very far, true, but the reason wasn\'t that people argued it to death.
Scott, Steve, Juergen and I had some very fruitful exchanges and I took
some decisions based on those discussions. Mind you, none of the others
agreed totally with me on very much; Scott thought that the TLs of the
area ought to be lower than what I eventually decided on, Steve didn\'t
quite believe in the gimmick I used to open up this frontier, etc., but
my impression was that they were willing to agree to disagree and go on
with it. The reason why it ground to a halt was that I were too busy to
keep up my end of it (I functioned more or less as an editor, I guess).

I think that such projects can succeed, but only if one or two persons are
willing to function as "primus motor" for each project, which will entail
a lot of work for said "editors", and only if the other people involved are
willing to let the editors take decisions. The last bit also requires
the editors to be flexible enough to let go of their own pet ideas once
in a while.

I have a complete framework for a "putting Humpty-Dumpty together again"
adventure that I think is pretty damn ingenious. The aforementioned "New
Frontier" project was actually my first step in getting this campaign
going, as the initial impetus comes from one of the unknown planets.
I\'d love to have some help developing it if only I had the time. Oh well,
one of these days I will TAKE the time...

I think the trick is to give these things a try, but not to get one\'s
hopes up too much. Most projects may flop, propably will, but before that
happens some useful stuff will almost certainly  be produced. I\'ve already
gotten a lot of neat ideas for the New Frontier from Scott and the others.
Even if nothing more ever comes of it, I\'ve had some fun and profit from
those three or four weeksit lasted. And who knows? Maybe I can revive it
someday.

By all means let us get on with Gamba. But in keeping with my idea of
the extreme importance of the "project editor", I suggest that it is
quite necessary for Rob to issue occasional updates of which of our
many ideas he has decided to make "official". I for one would like to
see a revised set of world descriptions soon, as there have been a lot
of different ideas, some mutually exclusive, presented. I know that he
has said "we\'ll go with this" on several occasions, but I\'d like a
coherent update of the whole thing.

Or possibly by a group of people guided by one person wih one vision.

THE AGRICOLANS

Unfortunately, I can\'t draw.  I especially can\'t draw in ASCII, so I  can\'t
transfer  the little sketch of an Agricolan to the list.  My conception  of
the  Agricolans is that they are four limbed, with a long heavy tail  which
includes a vertical fin structure.  Their feet are webbed and provide  most
of their water propulsion, with the tail used for steering.  The  forelimbs
each  have  a  hand with four relatively delicate  fingers.   The  skin  is
smooth,  and  a mottled dark gray/green on top, shading to a  fairly  light
gray below.  This provides camouflage from above and below.  I suppose that
camouflage from above would be an evolutionary advantage if the  Agricolans
or  their  ancestors were hunted by flying creatures, and  camouflage  from
below  is an advantage to any hunter swimming near the surface looking  for
prey  beneath it.  The sensory organs are fairly conventional, and  located
at  the front of the head.  (Should they have a sonar sense?)  Buoyancy  is
maintained by a swim bladder in the torso, which is interconnected with the
lungs, but which can be controlled separately.  In pregnant females in  the
later  stages of pregnancy the swim bladder is compressed by the  fetus  so
that  the female Agricolan cannot float.  The overall visual impression  of
an Agricolan would be something like a dolphin with tyrannosaur-like limbs.
I  should mention that breathing is done through a blowhole on top  of  the
head, like a dolphin\'s.

The  traditional  weapons of the Agricolans include  spears  and  tridents,
nets, knives and blow guns.  Most other Earth-type primitive weaponry would
not  be usable under water.  An Agricolan blowgun is a rather  odd  looking
piece  of equipment to human eyes, since it is powered by an  expulsion  of
air through the blow hole, above and behind the Agricolan\'s eyes.

            "Wind Cap"/\\----<  Muzzle of blow gun
                  ___/__\\__
                 /        o \\  Head of Agricolan
                    _________)
                   /

The  "wind cap", the curved part fitting over the blow hole, is shown  here
larger  than scale.  Due to the necessity of the curved shape, a  blow  gun
either  has to be muzzle loading, or break apart just forward of  the  wind
cap  in  order  to be insert the dart.  Both solutions have  been  used  at
various times.  A sight is usually installed on the bottom of the tube.

Agricolan  designed vehicles would take advantage of  Agricolan  locomotion
patterns.   Thus,  an Agricolan chair would hold an Agricolan  in  a  prone
position, with the sensory apparatus and hands at the front covering  minor
controls,  the  legs  and feet controlling the throttle(s),  and  the  tail
fitting into a steering fixture.  Two humans could probably work an Agrico-
lan  control  chair, since a stretched out Agricolan is  about  2.8  meters
long.   One would have to work the steering and the other the forward  con-
trols.  I can see this coming up in an annoying way in an adventure,  which
is why I mention it.

That\'s about all I\'ve figured out about the Agricolans so far.  Anyone  who
would  like  to suggest how their psychology is influenced by  their  semi-
aquatic lifestyle is welcome to do so...


OTHER FEATURES OF THE GAMBA SUBSECTOR:

I  still am visualizing the Gamba subsector as being fairly isolated,  with
no  real  external  threats.  As a result, I would  expect  Imperial  armed
forces units to be primarily used for peace-keeping and emergency  response
activities, and to be maintainable with local resources.  I won\'t post  the
design  today, but using book 2 you could have a 1000 ton TL13 patrol  ship
with 3-G maneuver and Jump-3, plus six pinnaces and 60 troops.

So, I came up with the following:

There are *2* Naval Bases, at Forqueray and Galliard.

     3 Imperial Navy squadrons are stationed in the subsector, two of which
have  the  above mentioned 1000 ton patrollers (one squadron of 6  at  Gal-
liard,  and  one  of 7 at Forqueray), and one of which is  a  light  escort
squadron with 12 Type T patrol cruisers, officially based at Forqueray, but
usually patrolling the class A and B starports in pairs, with a flight of 4
almost always at Lassus.  In the event of a major outbreak of piracy, or an
interplanetary war beyond the ability of these forces to handle, additional
ships  could  be brought from an adjacent subsector (to  be  determined  if
necessary,  when necessary).  If we decide to use the Adriano  incident,  a
large temporary Imperial force might be present there.  I think the  piracy
threat would be pretty low, personally, since none of the systems is really
lawless and high tech enough to be a good haven for space pirates.   "Claim
jumping" in the asteroid mining systems might be a problem, though...

There are *9* Scout bases:

Violone: anthropology, semi-interdiction
Pavane: anthropology
Madrigal: communication
Treble: emergency
Bass: system survey
Bach: communication
Weelkes: repair/support
Pardessus: emergency now, but repair/support under construction
Baldwyn: communication

I\'d figure that one Imperial marine regiment would be enough, so they\'ll be
based  at  Forqueray with the naval headquarters, such as it  is.   They\'re
probably equipped at TL13 using locally produced gear (from Lassus),  since
that\'s  enough  of an advantage over the local planetary  armies.   They\'ve
also  probably  got  a high number (for color)--I wrote them  down  as  the
986th.

I\'ve never been very comfortable with the entire idea of an Imperial  army,
but  if there is any major Imperial army presence, it is probably  centered
on Weelkes, and equipped at TL10.  Definitely third or fourth line...

Mercenaries  would probably be fairly scarce, too.  The main use of  merce-
naries,  as I read it, are on balkanized planets, and with Canzona being  a
mere  TL3,  and Agricola inhabited by aliens, I doubt that  there  is  much
demand.   Such mercenaries as there are probably mostly from  Weelkes,  and
equipped at TL10.  (Conveniently, I\'ve got a lot of TL10 military equipment
for MegaTraveller, if I were to decide to do something along those  lines.)
I  suppose that the Madrigalans might have a large standing army, more  for
internal  security than anything else, and that it might ship units out  to
other  systems  for practice, but moving TL6 military gear  around  doesn\'t
seem  very likely to be cost effective.  Counter examples and opinions  are
welcome.

I\'ve already mentioned that there were no psionics institutes when I rolled
the original stats, but if you accept the Gannon hypothesis as laid down  a
while back in Challenge, you might find a few isolated psionic  practition-
ers on Violone and/or Susato.

I tend to agree with the picture of these guys exporting luxury foodstuffs.
Maybe they can grow chocolate that is worth the trouble of exporting.
Certainly coffee tastes different wherever it is grown, so if their coffee
tastes good, then they can always find a market for it.  Likewise wine and
whiskey.

"Tech Level" as specified in the UPP represents the economic strength of
the world in question.  TL3 would represent very low industrialization, high
dependence on imports to maintain standard of living, large numbers of poor
people, and comparatively few wealthy ones.

I use the expanded TL description from WBH to generate two other "Tech Levels":

One represents the local ability to produce things.  This is normally based
on the standard WBH roll-up, with my own mods thrown in.

The other represents "standard of living", and is based on "novelty TL", and
the nature of nearby industrial worlds.  This one I have to free-hand in for
every world.  I can\'t think of a good way to automate it.

I agree with this.  All of the grand projects starts have had some value,
even if they weren\'t completed.  However, there is no doubt that the chance
of a project being finished is inversely proportional to the size of it.

I\'ll see what I can do.  My job is heating up a bit these days, and I was
supposed to be away from home all this week.  That trip was cancelled, only
to be replaced by another week long trip next week (the 19th through the
23rd).  As a result, I\'m a bit short of time until the 26th or so.  I may be
able to take a lap top and link in while I\'m gone, and I may not.

I\'ll make putting out a revised world list a priority.  Anyone wishing to have
an idea considered had better get it in in the next couple of days, though,
while I\'m still around to look at it.

This is a reasonable way of thinking about things, in my opinion, and one which
is more or less consistent with what we\'ve actually seen from GDW on the sub-
ject.  The only really detailed world description they published, the Tarsus
boxed module, shows the inhabitants of Tarsus with ready access to higher
tech imported goods, at an increased cost, of course.

As this applies to the Gamba subsector, how do you view the "standard of
living" tech levels on most of the planets?  I\'d suppose that the Madrigalans
import high tech production machinery from the small high tech planets (and/or
Weelkes) and export lower tech machinery to the TL3 and TL4 planets, as well
as cheap semi-bulk goods back to the high tech worlds.  If you take the Mega-
Traveller (or Merchant Prince) trade goods system as providing a general
indication of the potential traffic flows, I think that you\'ll find that
Madrigal goods can be sold at a profit on places like Lassus and Forqueray.
I haven\'t actually checked it, but the situation looks much the same as the
situation in the Spinward Marches, where TL9 industrial Aki can sell at a
profit on TL15 industrial Glisten, which would probably make Aki (or Madrigal)
a sort of Korea to Glisten\'s (or Lassus\') Japan.

How do shipping costs in Traveller affect the trade situation?  It has always
looked to me like interstellar shipping in Traveller is somewhat less expensive
than international air freight currently, but more expensive than international
sea transport.  Is that in accordance with other people\'s views?

Certainly does need a little more thought. That\'s why I asked for
ideas from the rest of you. My thought was that it would be either
something the Imperial government would want more than anyone --
or want to destroy more than anyone. Maybe something to do with
psionics?

But can you imagine a world that was over 95% water? The air would
probably make British fogs look like sunny days! And, if you com-
bine that with an atmosphere which allows more water to be suspended
in solution than the Terran atmosphere, you could end up breathing
in as much water as you do air. The human lung has certain unpleas-
ant reactions to being half-filled with water.

Yes, I think that this would work best, with the exception that I\'d like to
use TL13 as the Imperial base, with those two TL14 planets then being at the
real cutting edge of technology.  When would that put it, and what was going
on on the Imperial timeline?  If set earlier, my preferred astrography--in
the Verge sector--would not be a real problem.  That also means that I think
that we\'ll go with some version of Hans\' Long Night era pocket empire based
around Susato.

Also a possibility.  Is the history going to affect the adventure potential
a lot?  I\'m not really sure myself...

I don\'t know--we had to go a long way on foot between two planes in a fairly
short amount of time, and I had just about enough time left over to call my
brother and tell him we were on schedule, without anything left over to grab
a candy bar from a vendor.  I wonder if this happens to people making conn-
ections at Class A starports?  If you believe the SOM, I suppose it couldn\'t
because the random jump lenght would make you reluctant to try to meet a
scheduled connection less than a day or two later than your arrival...

You\'d probably be okay in the Seventh Century here, with the Solomani not yet
quite to the point of being a muscle-flexing major player in the Imperial
Court and a lot of flak from the Civil War settling out. As for the Verge,
I\'m reluctant to flush the existing Atlas\'s star locations, but hell, it\'s
only one subsector. And if it has its bak to the Rift, then it\'d stay backward
for a long time. I would put TL13 as a limit for other reasons: no Battle
Dress and no Fusion Guns, with Plasma Guns still bulky, dangerous, and rare.
Gauss weapons just coming into widespread use, with TL10-11 stuff in abundance.
Perfect environment for taking some stuffing out of the shirts of powerhappy
parties. |->

Depends on the Ref. It means a LOT to me and my parties. I think I prefer the
Civil War era to the Hard Times. Less messy in a metagaming way.

The concept of a prebooked connection Jump boggles my mind. Completely.
Anywhere other than Tukera monopolized core areas, who would dare try?

As to the Atlas\'s star locations--if we don\'t want to conflict then we have to
go outside the area that it covers.

I just realized (-: that I\'m carrying TD18 with me today, which includes the
concise history of the Imperium.  They give the following for tech levels:

Sylean Federation, Year 0, TL12
                      300, TL13  (allows exploration of Sabmiqys...)
                      420, (First Survey...)
                      629, (End of Civil War)
                      700, TL14
                      826, (End of Psionic Suppressions...hmmm...)
                     1000, TL15
                     1120, TL16

I hadn\'t thought about it before, but sticking with the Imperial timeline would
have an odd effect if the game was set before the Psionic Suppressions.
Psionics would not only _not_ be illegal, they would be positively encouraged.
Different...

I also hate to mention this, but Battledress is canonically available at TL13.

A general TL13 with occasional TL14 would be consistent with a setting in the
late 600\'s (7th century.)

    'body' => 'TCS Update:

	The first year of my TCS game is over, and relevant data (except
Jane\'s, which I am way behind on, so don\'t bug me yet) has been
diseminated to all the players.

	There were ten space battles, and two groundside campaigns of
varying lengths during the first year.  Taking these in chronological
order, we have:

		1)  The opening battle of the Old Islands War, which has no
official designation since it is supposedly still secret.  Since
everyone has heard about it anyway, I can now confirm that on or about
turn 8, two squadrons of Sansterran fighters attached to St Genevieve
System Command attacked, without warning or provocation, a flight of New
Home couriers.  Three of these couriers were destroyed, or disabled and
captured.  The fourth escaped.  This incident was repeated less than a
day later when a second flight of New Home couriers arrived in St
Genevieve.  The results were the same.  In both cases, the fighter
pilots attempted to disable the New Home couriers with conventional
weapons, but when they found that they could not, they resorted to
attack with nuclear missiles.

		2)  The First Battle of St Genevieve.  This battle was the first
openly acknowledged battle in the Old Islands War.  New Home sent a
quick retaliatory strike against the St Genevieve System Command.  The
strike consisted of 10 fighter carriers, plus their 300 Wasps and ten
Petras.  The fighters were deployed at the 100 diameter limit, and then
proceeded to attack the Sansterran fleet near St G.  Meanwhile, the
Petras provided cover for the carriers, which moved away from the FEBA.
The wasps proceeded to disable six Sansterran battleships and several
hundred Barracuda fighters before withdrawing.  Casualties taken by the
Wasps approached 50% from all causes.  Not one wasp was destroyed by a
Sansterran fighter.  The New Home attack force withdrew from the system.

	At this point, Sansterre began preparations to invade New Home.

		3)  The Second Battle of St Genevieve:  Neubayern and New Home
each sent a force into St Genevieve system to expel Sansterre.  This
force, consisting of Neubayern\'s Second Strike Fleet, Third Fleet,
Fourth Fleet, and Second Assault Fleet, plus 18 New Home Reapers and 900
Wasps, plus their carriers, proceeded to stomp the Sansterran forces
into the ground.  The only bright spot in this battle for Sansterre was
the degree to which his Barracudas completely dominated a force of
Neubayern fighters ten times as large as it was.  Sansterre was
expelled, most of his jump-capable ships fleeing back to Sansterre,
while his riders were captured by the attacking forces.

At this time, both Neubayern and New Home were trying to convince
Sansterre\'s ally Amondiage that this war was none of his business.  It
has now become clear that Amondiage\'s reaction to the war was a response
to Neubayern\'s entry into the war, rather than a response to New Home\'s
offensive operations (described as "probably going to _really_ surprise
Sansterre and everyone else!" by Sir James Bathory, Director of
Amondiage).

At any rate, at about the same time as the above attack on St Genevieve:

		4)  The Battle of Neubayern:  200-odd Amondiage Swords jumped to
the 100-diameter limit of Neubayern.  They accelerated toward Neubayern,
fought his System Squadron in passing, and executed a nuclear
bombardment of Neubayern\'s starport and ship-building industries.  The
survivors then fled the system.  Most of the attacking Swords were
damaged severely, but only a relative handful were actually destroyed.
Neubayern captured 23 that were too severely damaged to jump away.  The
remainder spent several to many weeks working their way back to
Amondiage for repairs.

		5)  The Battle of New Home:  150 Amondiage swords appeared near
the 100-diameter limit of New Home, and attacked New Home\'s System
Squadron.  The New Home fighters available (mostly obsolete Mosquitos)
were destroyed, while the remaining New Home Reapers jumped away from
the battle after doing as much damage as possible.  After the defeat of
the New Home System Squadron, part of the remaining Amondiage Swords
were detailed to executing a bombardment of New Home similar to that
done to Neubayern.  They succeeded, but nearly all the Swords that so
attacked were destroyed by New Home\'s impressive planetary defense
batteries.  The survivors returned to Amondiage by diverse routes.

		a)  Beginning about now, Neubayern Marines and Army units began
to remove the Sansterran Marines garrisoning St G.  This campaign
continued for three weeks before the situation changed.

		6)  The Battle of Sansterre:  The New Home Fleet in St G,
together with a rider squadron lent them by Neubayern, proceeded to jump
to Sansterre immediately after Second St G.  They found the Sansterran
Fleet in disarray, with the strongest elements damaged or destroyed the
week before.  They knocked out the entire Sansterran System Squadron,
except those that fled into the dubious protection of Sansterre\'s
planetary defense batteries.  One of Sansterre\'s "Guppies", a 900,000T
transport, was destroyed by New Home Reapers, in spite of the protection
afforded by the planetary defense batteries.  After the response to that
attack by Sansterran planetary defenses, the New Home admiral placed
nuclear demolitions on all captured Sansterran ships, and left the
system.

	At this point, Sansterre changed his mind about invading New Home.
	Sansterre immediately surrendered.  As was later obvious, this
surrender was premature.  Most of Sansterre\'s jump-capable ships were
relatively intact, and Sansterre\'s planetary defenses were sufficient to
make invasion impossible.
	In any case, quiet ensued for two more weeks.  During this period,
Amondiage and New Home began to discuss the possibility of peace.  Both
New Home and Neubayern had been hurt badly by the war to date, while
Amondiage was now all alone, with a significant part of his fleet either
damaged or destroyed.  Before anything solid came of this...

		7)  The Third Battle of St Genevieve:  Neubayern, worried about
the possibility of another raid by Amondiage, ordered his forces in St
Genevieve to guard all four gas giants to prevent Amondiage from
refueling there for an attack on Neubayern.  Amondiage took advantage of
this by attacking St Genevieve with 1000-odd Swords.  This force was
rather more than Amondiage had been known to possess BEFORE the fighting
had begun, much less after the depletion of the attacks on Neubayern and
New Home.  (No resolution to this apparent discrepancy was ever
discovered).  The Amondiage Fleet attacked the Neubayern Fleet guarding
St Genevieve, capturing or destroying the entire force.  Then it
proceeded to intercept the fleet coming in from the outer gas giant and
defeated it.  Then it turned (this was a VERY small system - the outer
gas giant was in orbit 4) to intercept the remaining two fleets, which
had joined together and were proceeding toward the 100-diameter limit
from the sun at 1G.  They were caught near the jump-limit, and the
riders provided cover for the tenders and other jump-capable stuff until
they had escaped.  The riders were all captured.  This was, BTW, the
only time in the Old Islands War that Amondiage allowed the "line of
battle" to interfere with what he was doing.  It has since been learned
that his fleets were under orders to capture as many of Neubayern\'s
riders as possible, in order to provide a suitable defense of St G while
the Amondiage Fleet was elsewhere.  The next day, Neubayern\'s BatRon1
jumped into St G on a routine rotation.  It was attacked, and forced to
flee.

	The Neubayern Army on St G had, by now, nearly rooted out the last
of the Sansterran defenders.  The removal of their ortillery by
Amondiage forced them to back off for a short time.  During that three
day period, Amondiage secured the remainder of the system, and returned
to St G.  The Amondiage admiral ordered the Neubayern Army to surrender
on pain of nuclear bombardment.  The Neubayern Army did so, and were
interned there building new domes for Sansterran colonists until they
were repatriated to Neubayern six months later.

	At this point, Neubayern began planning an attack on Amondiage.
Colchis attempted such an attack.  And New Home and Amondiage continued
to discuss peace, this time with Amondiage clearly in the stronger
position.
	Then, the situation changed, when Serendip Belt brought its main
Fleet units into Topas to expel the Neubayern garrison that had been
there since early in the year.  Amondiage found itself with insufficient
resources to prevent an attack such as he executed against Neubayern.
Neubayern was being forced into a corner by attacks from both sides, and
so was more likely to actually attack Amondiage with the intent of
destroying them completely, thus removing one enemy from the equation.

Net result:  both Neubayern and Amondiage backed off a little, and peace
descended on the Islands for a few months.

	Well, almost.  Serendip Belt moved an Army onto Topas in opposition
to Neubayern\'s Army on Topas.  Serendip Belt\'s Fleet controlled local
space pretty thoroughly.  Neubayern kept two squadrons at the edge of
the system.
	A military coup occurred on New Colchis.  They threw out one
dictator, and replaced him with another ("Meet the new boss, same as the
old boss.")
	After several months of wrangling over details of cease-fires and
conferences, and shapes of tables, and such, the Old Islands powers
(Amondiage, Colchis, Neubayern, New Home, Sansterre) and St
Hilaire/Esperanza met on New Home to discuss a permanent peace, and the
formation of the Old Islands Alliance.
	Meanwhile, alarmed at the New Home/Neubayern alliance, New Colchis
new government and Serendip Belt met on Elysee to discuss their own
alliance.

	ASIDE:  By this time, all the worlds in the Islands have fallen into
one camp or another except Zuflucht.  New Colchis had scarfed up Elysee
and Besancon during the Old Islands War.  St Hilaire had extended a
rather meaningless dominion over Nebelwelt and Wellington.  New Home
found itself in control of Sturgeon\'s Law.  Amondiage and Sansterre took
control of St Genevieve and Achille, which control Amondiage now
maintained by itself in the wake of Sansterre\'s surrender.  Neubayern
had taken control of Berlichingen (more or less).  Serendip Belt found
itself more or less in control of Topas, though the legitimate
government plus their Fleet continued to exist on Amondiage.

	Net result of several weeks of discussions:  The Old Islands
Alliance, consisting of Colchis, Neubayern, New Home, Sansterre, and St
Hilaire/Esperanza.  And the Elysee Concord, consisting of New Colchis
and Serendip belt.  But during those few weeks...

		b)  Serendip Belt ordered its Army on Topas to disarm and intern
the Neubayern Army there.  The Neubayern Army fought back.  So now we
have the beginning of a ground campaign which will continue for three
months or so.

	And...

		8)  The First Battle of Topas:  The Neubayern Squadron in Topas
jumped out within a day of the attack on the Neubayern Army.  A week
later, the Neubayern squadrons appeared right by Topas, and attacked the
Belter fleet there.  At this point, the Belters discovered that their
fleet had indeed fallen on hard times, as a force of light cruisers and
even lighter riders proceeded to decimate their main fleet.  The Belters
won the battle, or at least held the field after the Neubayern survivors
jumped out.  But they lost the majority of their heavy fleet units, and
discovered that their light units could not compete with modern TL12
warships.  The Neubayern commander used the attack as a diversion to
deploy several hundred of Neubayern\'s fighters down to the Neubayern
troop concentrations on Topas.
	Since the Belter fighters were distinctly inferior to even
Neubayern\'s poor fighters, the Neubayern Army enjoyed a reasonable
facsimile of air-superiority for over a month.  During that time, the
Serendip Belt Army ceased offensive operations while they prepared
defensive positions to be used in case of space attack, and reinforced
to the tune of another 200,000 men.
	At the same time, the Belt recovered the damaged Neubayern ships,
which could be repaired and returned to service much faster than the
Belt ships could be refitted to modern standards.  So the mainstay of
the Belt fleet was a handful of Neubayern light riders for a while.  The
Belt also accelerated its renovation program, refitting every ship
possible to TL12 standards.
	And Neubayern ordered the arrest and trial of the admiral who had
fought the Belter fleet.  Before she could be brought to trial, she
disppeared from her holding cell, and has not yet reappeared.

	New Colchis moved a force of several hundred ships into Topas to
show solidarity with Serendip Belt, and to discourage Neubayern.

	So now we have the Alliance and the Concord arguing over who should
get to keep Topas.  Neither really wants to fight over it, neither
really wants to give it up.
	When Serendip Belt shifted back to the offensive, the Alliance
finally decided to rescue the Neubayern troopers on Topas.  The newly
formed Alliance Fleet, operating under the command of the New Home
admiral who led the attack on Sansterre, moved into the Topas system.
The Alliance Fleet refueled in one of Topas gas giants, then jumped to
the positions that the Belter Fleet occupied.  Unfortunately, the Belter
admiral, fearing an attack on Serendip Belt with most of the fleet away,
jumped home to the Belt.  The Alliance Fleet appeared next to the New
Colchis Squadron, and attacked, driving them to jump away with heavy
damage after less than two hours of combat.

	Meanwhile...

		10)  The Battle of Elysee:  Neubayern\'s Fifth Strike Fleet,
operating under Alliance Fleet Command orders, attacked the New Colchis
Squadron at Elysee.  Since they outnumbered and outgunned the New
Colchis squadron by a factor of 15 or so, the battle was very short, and
very one-sided.  Of course, the fact that most of New Colchis large
units present were only 1G ships didn\'t hurt, since that meant they
couldn\'t escape.  A week later, New Colchis ships fleeing the Second
Battle of Topas arrived in Elysee to find a Neuybayern Fleet awaiting
them.  They were out of fuel, and mostly non-functional, and mostly
surrendered immediately.

	Meanwhile...

	The Serendip Belt Fleet arrived back in the Belt.  No Alliance
forces in sight.  The Chairman of Serendip Belt immediately ordered the
Fleet commander\'s arrest.  The Fleet, under new command, returned to
Topas to find the Alliance firmly in control.  They worked out a local
cease-fire, then returned to the Belt.  The Alliance Fleet brought in
Sansterran troop transports and withdrew the Neubayern Army from Topas.
Then the Alliance Fleet withdrew back to Neubayern.

	The Serendip Belt, upon hearing that the Alliance had withdrawn from
Topas, ordered the removal of his own troops from that system.

Meanwhile...

	New Colchis, perturbed by the capture of several hundred of his
ships, declared war on Neubayern.  This war continues, though there has
been no fighting to date.  New Colchis has imposed severe restrictions
on all merchant traffic into New Colchis system.  Various Alliance
members (Sansterre and St Hilaire) responded with similar measures.
Upon protest by New Home and veiled threat by Amondiage, Sansterre
revoked its commercial restrictions.  St Hilaire, being far enough away
not to annoy anyone, maintains theirs.
	Serendip Belt continues to rearm.  Neubayern continues to wonder
when Amondiage is going to repatriate all those captured NFN warships.
Sansterre continues to redesign his fleet.

	And through all this, Joyeuse sat quietly on the sidelines and
smiled.  At the end of the year, Joyeuse offered his Wyvern light riders
for sale.  The positive response from almost every quarter gave an
indication of how much damage had been done to the fleets of the Islands
this past year.

	Score card:  Population losses:  Neubayern 210,000,000 dead.
									 New Home 63,000,000 dead.

				 Final disposition of territories:
						Amondiage : Amondiage, Acadie, Achille, St
Genevieve (the latter two shared with the Alliance).
						Colchis : Colchis.
						Joyeuse : Joyeuse, Quichotte.
						Neubayern : Neubayern, Schliesen Belt,
Berlichingen(more or less).
						New Colchis : New Colchis, Herzenslust, Elsysee,
Besancon.
						New Home : New Home, Sturgeon\'s Law.
						Sansterre : Sansterre, St Denis, St
Genevieve(colony on main world).
						Serendip Belt : Serendip Belt, Gloire, partial
control of Topas.
						St Hilaire/Esperanza : St Hilaire, Esperanza,
Nebelwelt, Wellington.
						Topas : government in exile on Amondiage,
possibly able to return home now.
						Zuflucht : independent, has acquired a large
number of obsolete warships from Serendip Belt in an attempt to fight
off a takeover by St Hilaire that never came.

	There have been several interesting ideas for getting more out of
their resources from diverse people.  Serendip Belt and New Colchis have
a trade pact.  New Home and St Hilaire have one.  The Alliance members
are considering an Alliance wide trade pact.  Other, less obvious things
are happening behind the scenes.

	And Serendip Belt and Neubayern are still arguing about Topas :-)

After Rob Dean had killed the neverending discussion about the new Traveller
(thank you Rob, for getting us all back on out hobby), I\'ve decided to create
some new vehicles and robots for my campaigne. My group had earned lots of
money, so I spend some time to create new items, to get the money back ;-).

I will send three of the designs to the group. The first is listed beneath.
Although I can\'t compare to Rob Dean and Scott Kellogg, some of you perhaps
will enjoy them.

The following design uses the TRAVELLER Robot design rules for the robot
brain, sensor equipment,the programs and some of the appendages. I had used
the suggestions in 101 Vehicles to create the system. The hull and powerplant
is choosen using the MT craft design rules. Weight is given in kg (not in tons
as usual), volumes for fuel in liters.

		Mechanics-4, Engineering-4, Gravitics-4, Laser-Welder-4,
		Technical Sensors-4, Grav Vehicle(Subrobots)-4
URP:		K10//-00-NT327-00CG(M)

Comments:
The skill Grav Vehicle-4 must be inserted, because the subrobots have Grav
Locomotion, so the robot need this skill to control their motions.
Technical Sensors is a special skill, to read and interpret the datas, the
subrobots gain.
3D Holodisplay and holographic linked panel are included in the design, to
give a skilled engineer the possibility to influence the robot directly.
During a repair task the operator can use these, to supervise the operation.
The Robot it fully capable of simulation and simulative displaying planed
operations.
The main powersource of the robot is the power interface. The Fuel Cell is
included, to give the robot the possibility to repair a ship powerplant.
All the subordinate robots can be hidden inside the hull of this master.
If they are not used, they didn\'t require any place outside the hull of
the master robot.

Subrobot 1:

                Electronic Toolpack, Micromechanic Toolpack.
URP:		815/E-14-00000-JF00

Comments:
All appendages can be hidden inside the hull, which is cube shaped and
630x630x630 mm length. The robot is equipped with a wide array of sensors,
to provide a broad range of information to the master robot. Olfactory
senses are added, to help finding overheated bearings or fire. The robot
is not equipped with anti fire equipment.
This model is especially designed for finding and repairing of minor damages,
and damages in really small units. using its small laser welder, the robot
is able to provide help repairing Computers, Grav Units, low energy conectors
and similar small devices. The heavy armor protection of this small unit,
provides the ability, to use the light repair robot during EVActivities.
It is suggested, however, to add additional fuel, if EVA is planed.

Subrobot 2:
CraftID:        Heavy Repair Subrobot, TL 15, Cr 140820
Hull:           1/2, Disp=0.056, Config=4USL, Armor=40G, Unloaded=833.2kg,

		ObjSize=Small, EMLevel=Moderate, large laser welder,
		Mechanical Toolpack, Metalwork Toolpack, medium Tentacle(x2),
		heavy Tentacle(x2), heavy robot arm(x2)
URP:		A47/E-16-00000-UF00
Comments:
This unit is designed to carry large and heavy parts, and to do the heavy
work i.e. stop leaking, exchange Zuchai-Crystals, replace heavy energy circuits,
replace grav plates and so on. It can be used for EVA. Same suggestions
apply as for the light repair unit.
As it\'s smaller cousine, this unit too can hide all its appendages in its
hull. If done so, the robot looks like a cube 910x910x910 mm.

One reason why I don\'t think I\'d mind a little bit of conflict with the Atlas.
Going beyond it won\'t be easy, especially if your heart\'s set on the Verge
(interesting how these Rift-edge areas fascinate us: my latest campaign is
set in the Cyril\'s Edge corner of Reft).

Oh, I know. The Psionics Institutes would be everywhere, and the situation
would be much more like it is in the Vargr Extents in the 1100s than anything
else-- with psi being part of the local color, anywhere from a curiosity under
study by scientists to a part of some cultures (mind-reading judges, anyone?).

I\'m not a huge fan of psionics in a game like Traveller, but it\'ll be a
nice change of pace. Also note other prevailing attitudes (variable as you
travel around): a much stronger Vilani streak (but with an accompanying sense
of "illegitimacy" due to the Solomani-strong Court (I believe that Antiama
wouldn\'t have married into the Royal Family yet)); a dislike of the Zhodani
as previously hostile humans, but nothing like the psychotic hatred implanted
in the Suppressions; a much stronger distrust of Aslan, with the wars either
recent or still ongoing, and a fascination with the newly-integrated Vargr.

>I also hate to mention this, but Battledress is canonically available at TL13.

Yes, but only in limited and controlled quantities. It would have been
invented centuries earlier, but would not have been that useful or needed
before the Zhodani began making trouble. I would assume that you would need
both money AND governmental "pull" to get anything hotter than Combat Armor
and a PGMP-12, and the standards among Travellers would be Combat Environment
Suits (or lower-TL Scout vaccsuits) and Gauss rifles as squad support to
ACRs, SCPs, Accelerator Rifles, ARLs, Rocketguns and Snubbies. And lasers,
natch.

It simplifies the game if you know there\'s a lot of empty space in at least
one direction.

Sounds good.  A Verge location would make Vargr occasional possibles, Aslan
rather less likely, and the other major races right out.  A Daibei rift
edge location would reverse that.

I\'m not too keen on psionics either, but that\'s the way the cards fall if
we adopt the 8th century.  In that case, I\'d still stick with the situation
of no Psionics Institutes in the Gamba subsector.  Treating it as science
would make a Galliard location possible if one was desired or perhaps one
on Weelkes to draw from the larger population.  Hmmm....maybe there was one
on Adriano before the plague.  I wonder if there might be a connection? 0-:

The Core isn\'t really that far away, but yes.  Besides, by this time the wars
are over, so fleets would have been back in position for a couple of decades.

(I wonder how often the Imperium moves things around?  Some U.S. Army units
were stationed in essentially the same places in Germany for over 40 years,
and some of the Roman military units whose history can be traced through
inscriptions and the like were apparently stationed in the same forts for
centuries. "My great grandfather was the first one in our family to serve in
the 2957th CruRon, and it has been a family tradition since...")

Well, I\'m still messing with the plot for the Harrison Chapters. It
seems that just when you get going, you slam into some sort of
technical problem. Recently, I sent questions to the TML about
tiny nukes, effects of vacuum on the unprotected. This time I\'m
wondering about cyanide gas (I hope the TML-chemists aren\'t
jumpy tonight).

Here\'s what I\'ve gleaned so far.

You take NaCN (Sodium Cyanide), mix it with some HCl (Hydrochloric
acid), and whammo, lots of HCN (Hydrogen Cyanide gas). I means lots.
Enough to really ruin everybody\'s day assuming you\'re on a
closed air supply (like a starship). Say one bucket of
ingredients per 10,000 tons of displacement affected?

Basically, I need know two things. First, is the above
description correct? Will just mixing the two make HCN and
will it really be a gas (ain\'t much  good as a liquid)?
And is it really as potent as I\'m pretending (one bucket to
10,000 tons seems a little steep, maybe it\'s just me)?

Second, what does NaCN and HCN look like, smell like, etc? Well,
I guess not many people know what HCN smells like... :-) but you
get the idea. I need lots of adjectives for the story, and I don\'t
mean the sort you\'d find reading an encyclopedia. Anybody
have an ounce of hands-on experience with this sort of
thing? (Don\'t say anthing self-incriminating, now :-)

Many many many thanks in advance.

	This sounds moderately reasonable.  Using my house mods, Madrigal
would be functional TL10 plus or minus, with a LARGE lower class.  The
upper crust would be living at TL14, or maybe 15 in a few areas.  Public
education would be non-existant (since it would presumably educate
people to TL10 standards, and the indicated poverty level could not,
IMHO, exist with proper education of the masses.
	Most of the "low TL" planets would be functioning at TL7-9, with
imports in the TL14 range for the upper crust.  Except for the world
with the native sophonts.  They probably should follow this pattern, but
they could be anything that struck your fancy without bending reality
too far.
	One obvious place that high TL items should be seen:  fusion
plants.  TL15 fusion plants can be imported from Terra if necessary, and
still cost less than the locally produced TL14 stuff.  The lowered cost
at TL15 even makes importation of spares from as far away as Terra
reasonable.  (ASIDE:  I plugged fusion plants into the T&C program, and
found that they could be profitably sold anywhere within 2500 parsecs of
their point of origin, if there are no other TL15 worlds closer to the
point of sale.  So if there is even one TL15 world left in teh Imperium,
look for TL15 fusion plants all over.)

	Traveller shipping costs are lower than they look.  After all, when
they talk about a ton, they mean 13.5 Kl, not 1000Kg.  They are still
much higher than international ocean freight charges, but not as much as
you might think.  The real problem is that Traveller, in all its
incarnations has set prices for bulk goods too low.  Back in the good
ol\' days, a ton (displacement) of gems went for MCr1.  Face it, at $1000
plus per carat, diamonds are worth a lot more than MCr1 per 13.5 Kl.  In
fact, if you use a dollar = credit (which was a good approximation when
Traveller originally came out), a million in diamonds could be carried
in a small briefcase.  Similiar cases can be made for most of the high
value items on the original list.
	In MT, nothing is worth much more than KCr10 per ton, which just
exacerbates the problem.  Cynthia and I have used Merchant Prince and
its descendants (with our own mods, some of which were posted here once)
as a good indicator of overall trade patterns.  But it is next to
useless as a trade system, since it assumes that interstellar trade uses
AVERAGE cargo value as an approximation to any specific deal.  But
average is not good enough, when most of the products of ANY world are
not worth exporting.  So they should be left out of the averaging
process, and the actual value of goods shipped should be in the range of
ten times as valuable (and costly) as MT indicates.
	This has been a major digression.  Oh well, I\'m losing my grip while
the Braves are getting their heads beat in by the Pirates.

There is, of course, one minor problem.  Who is building all these fusion
plants?  The TL15 world is going to supply (a) itself, and (b) the highest
outside bidder, in that order.  I\'d expect the going price to be slightly
more than that of a TL14 plant of similar power; what you\'re paying for is
the smaller size.

The reaction sounds right.  I\'m not sure about the toxicity (sp?),
given that a starship has filters, that sounds a bit low.

Basically, yes.

NaCN is a white powder.  Looks like any other white powder in the lab.

Actually I *have* smelled HCN.  Get a bottle of almond extract, put it
under your nose, and inhale hard.  (you\'ll have to imagine the
splitting headache I got....)

Almonds.  Sorta sweet odor.  Sorta pleasant.  Splitting headache.
(don\'t know how it gets when the concentrations get fatal.  It blocks
cellular respiration so people just sorta fall down dead, in about 10
seconds.  Face turns blue and they generally thrash around a lot.)

Ahh...just a small addition on the engineering robot:
The robot is intended, to replace a group of up to ten engineers on board
a ship. But it can not do the work without at least one human operator,
which should of corse be an engineer. One Engineer with the help of this
robot can do the work of ten normal Engineers and fulfil the additional task
of subordinate craft maintainance. Please note: The robot can work without
human assistance for a while, but crucial work should not be done without
a human supervisor. However, this robot can reduce the needed Engineering

Comments:
Though expensive, this recon probe fastly found its market. The probe can
be launched using a standard missile tube of a missile turret. It\'s Robot
brain enables the probe to operate independend for a limited period. Standard
procedures suggest a program, which orders the probe to find it\'s mothership,
after the connection is lost. Because of the significant skill in Navigation,
it is possible for the probe to find it\'s mothership, if this unit has not
changed the astrogational parameters of its course.
The Sensors of the probe are by default limited to video cameras. The pictures,
the probe sees, are directly transmitted via radio. It is possible to add
different sensors i.e. Neural Activity Sensors or small Densitometers. The
output of this units can be linked to the Robot Brain. It is possible to
connect the added sensors to the powersupply of the probe, but this is not
recommended, because the severe duration limits, the probe suffers from.
It\'s suggested to add secondary power sources to added sensor equipment.
The payload compartment, which holds 40.8 liters is large enough, to hold
different hightech sensors. Please note: The cargo compartment has no
life support. The transport of living beings is not recommended.

Subject: Question about Cyanide Gas (for a good cause :-)

I\'m not much for the chemical reaction part but I\'ve used calcium
cyanide to kill things. ;-)

When I was keeping bees a few years ago the local inspector gave
me some to kill a hive that was infected with foulbrood (a bad
disease for you non-apiarists). It was a gray colored powder with a
heavy, musty odor. Really noticeable once you\'ve smelled it.
A tablespoon killed the hive (~3.5 cu ft) in less than a minute.
I don\'t know what the concentration was though.

It also worked great in my killing jar that I used for collecting
insects. The teaspoon that I put in there was still effective
several years later.

A recent posting wanting some Traveller related material prompted
me to dig out my old stuff.  I haven\'t been involved in any games
of Traveller for many years, except for the PBM game, and don\'t see
any sense in just leaving this stuff to sit the back of a closet
when someone might want to use it.  Therefor I\'ve decided to offer
it for sale.  If you want anything listed below, drop me an email
or call.  I won\'t be taking bids and posting results, just make me
an offer and we\'ll deal.

I like it!  I like it!  LIMIT that Tech Level!
This hits on one of my favorite managerial bits in Trav.
Almost all the Reffing I have done is in a sector of my
design:  Iakr (Foreven to you Imps...)  The one adjacent
to The Spinward Marches.

One of the first assumptions I made was that the tech
level was a lot lower than the Imperium.  There is ONE
high tech planet in the whole sector and that is way
up there at TL 14 (Ooooo!)  There are No TL 13 planets,
and the military superpowers are equiped at TL 12 (Wow!)
Sure there were some high tech imports, (The League of
Suns has cast off TL 13 equipment from the Imperium)
But it is all very rare, and only front line military
has it.

But, there is still some ultra-deadly junk out there to
make even TL 15 players worry.  I once had a fun dogfight
between a crippled cargo ship and a flight of TL6 Mitchell
B-25H\'s equipped with 80mm cannons.  (Not to mention a few
kamikaze P-51 Mustangs...)

But, the point I\'m kinda making is that even limiting the
tech level pretty severely, you still get some ultra
deadly weaponry.  Anyone who thinks TL 8 is passe\' oughtta
look at the CNN War.

And if you check the archives you\'ll find that there are
designs out there for battle dress starting at TL9.  (My work)

The basic assumption was trying to work up an armored
version of the cargo loaders in \'Aliens\'.  They are
big, clunky, and clumsy but they pack a lot of firepower.
The Tilly in the 4.5th Frontier War is an TL 14 example of
the idea.  The interesting thing is that they work out to
be CHEAPER than the ordinary battle dress, while they have
something like a strength of 150 or so and more firepower
to boot (integral RAM GL).

So, TL 13 and below won\'t SOLVE the problem of having too
much firepower around, but it will keep things out of the
clouds.

About the placement of Gamba.
Here is an off the wall idea fer ya\'ll.  We have seen all
kinds of adventures involving Nearly all the major races.
The Zho\'s have been done to death.  The Vargr also.  The
Solomani and Aslan are up in in the top.  Droyne & Hivers:
Neglected but there.  Why?  The above listed are the easiest
to deal with.  The Droyne are easier than the Hivers.  The
Hiver\'s are IMO only workable as NPCs.

The K\'Kree are the most neglected of all.  Why?  They are
just too damn wierd to try and work with, and just about
impossible to roleplay properly.  They MIGHT work as NPCs,
but not without effort.

The only bit on the K\'Kree I ever saw that was good was a
short story in Challenge (?) K\'Kree Passage.

So, in an effort to try to use an underused race, (and a
chance to dust off Alien Module 2 and justify the $10...)
I think it would be neat to have Gamba up along the
border near the Two Thousand Worlds.  We don\'t have to
have a LOT of K\'Kree traffic, there.  It\'s still pretty
far from the TwoK Worlds, but if it were along the
traffic route we could justify K\'Kree ships passing through.

Hi all,

	I\'ve been off the list for quite a while, and pretty much
incommunicado for the past four months (after the last turn in the
Traveller PBEM).  It\'s nice to be back, although I\'m finding the
digest format annoying - anybody wanna point me at a mail exploder?
Mayhaps there\'s some way to convince Gnu Emacs rmail to explode it
for me.

	The subject of this post, besides saying hello, is the shape
of traveller role-playing.  I\'ve been observing different shapes and
styles of campaigns in the last few days since I started receiving the
TML again, and I thought I\'d comment and ask for other comments on the
different types of campaigns.

	There\'s "classic traveller", the small merchant ship full or
wandering heroes, roaming from planet to planet and adventure to
adventure much as modern day adventure series heroes wander.  This can
be quite fun, but I find it limiting in terms of long-term developments
outside of the player group (making enemies is easy, but making friends
and keeping them is trickier).

	Then there\'s what my fellow gamers back at Pitt used to call
traveller, involving lots of battledress, big guns, and massive
amounts of violence on a personal scale.  This fits in well with the
"classic" style of combat, since the heroes usually need to get out of
the star system in a hurry after one of their capers leaves bodies and
buildings sprawled in fragmented heaps everywhere.

	The tactics and the violence can be fun, but this generally
amounts to high-tech hack & slash.  I\'m generally of the attitude that
any sort of campaign that has the potential for high-tech violence
should realistically spend most of their time trying to figure out
ways to *avoid* it, and/or setting it up so that when it finally
comes, it\'s here an gone in an instant, leaving corpses everywhere,
none of them belonging to the characters who were smart enough to duck
at the right time (what a fun run-on sentence).

	There\'s violence on a larger scale, involving ship to ship
combat, piracy and anti-piracy, and even a minor role in a war,
although in most campaigns the characters don\'t have the power and
wealth necessary to get really involved (and if they did, they might
as well be playing TCS).  Again, fun, but kind of limiting.  This
seems to work best when mixed in with other kinds of campaigns.

	Occasionally I\'ve seen really fascinating campaigns, for
example the session of Metlay\'s campaign that I sat in on a year or
two back, and of course the Traveller PBEM (but admittedly, 30-40
players and gobs and gobs of playing time just doesn\'t happen in
Real Life campaigns).  Metlay\'s campaign seemed to focus a lot on
non-violent (or at least indirectly violent) scheming and role-
playing, which I found quite enjoyable.  The PBEM has tons of role-
playing and all sorts of weird things going on in different corners of
the campaign.

	I\'ve also seen "merchant prince" oriented campaigns, akin to
the war campaigns only on an economic level.  The players quickly
cease role-playing and become involved in controlling their
corporations.  I find playing a character more interesting than
playing a faceless corporation, so this doesn\'t appeal to me much,
but there is some entertainment in doing the economic warfare stuff.

	What are *your* opinion?  What are some of the more innovative
and interesting campaigns you\'ve seen?

Hmmm. I guess Verge *is* a long way from the Extents, but it\'s close enough
to the Hierate and Dark Nebula for there to be *some* Aslan incursions
and conflict, wouldn\'t you think?

Not 8th, 7th. I want TL14 to be as cutting edge as possible, and the Civil
War to be recent, painful history. I\'d suggest Weelkes for an Institute,
and as for Adraino and the plague, who was it who wanted to avoid cliches? |->

Yes, but people are still going to be rubbed raw by distrust of the Throne
and taxes to fund refitting of the Fleets.

I can see it. As borders expand, simply allocate new fleets to fill them.
Which means that the Core Fleet may pass on parade in Sylean dress uniforms.

This was my original idea; Gamba could be tucked away near the
mini-rift near Antares (which was in the process of a bloody war
and not yet an ultrahightech center in the 7th century) where
the lines between Imperium, Vargr, and K\'Kree colonial space get
vague. But Verge is also okay....

You are losing your grip on reality again.  Check the prices in the MT
books:  TL15, 250MW = MCr2.7, TL14, 250MW = MCr5.4.

With that kind of profit margin, SOMEONE will be making them for export.
Keep in mind that these power plant prices are lower than real world plants
by a factor of 100 or so.  (Good rule of thumb is $1 per watt.  Or it was a
good rule of thumb ten years ago.)

dumb to pour sand from a boot with printed instructions on the bottom of the

Not at all.  I\'m sorryt that I\'m late with the answer.  Several people
answered in last night\'s digest, and gave you the basics of what you need:
The smell, and the notion that the ship filters are probably going to be
capable of removing it as part of the regular air recirculation system.
I agree with this latter, byt the way, when you consider that a likely
contingency to be provided for is a fire onboard, which could give you all
sorts of nasty stuff considering the likely amount of plastic on board a
ship.

So far so good.  I assume that you can do the chemical equations and molecular
weights bit enough to figure out that it will take you 49 grams of NaCN plus
36.4 grams of HCl to give you 27 grams of HCN plus byproducts.  Excess acid
would probably be either desirable or OK.

10,000 displacement tons is 135,000 cubic meters.  With my handy copy of
the Army field manual on potential military chemical agents, I see that
they give two example numbers for lethal concentration: At 200 milligrams
per cubic meter of air, the LCt50 is about 2000 mg-min/m**3.  That is, you\'d
have to breathe that atmosphere for 10 minutes before you had a 50% chance
of death.  The book says that the lethal dose (figured in minutes in a
given concentration) varies storngly with the concentration because the gas
is detoxified by the body fairly quickly.  At 150mg/m**3, the LCt50 is
4500 mg-min/m**3, i.e. a 30 minute exposure.  OK.  For a rough approximation
let\'s say that the 2000mg-min/m**3 is a firm figure, and that we want to
deliver the dose in 10 seconds, because at that concentration it will be
instantly detectable and crews must be trained to don vacc suits (or the
helmets) pretty fast in emergencies.  Not to mention the fact that the air
filters would start cleaning it up pretty quickly.  (In fact, they\'d
probably keep it confined to the room that the mixing occurred in...but
we\'ll pretend not in order to get a number).  OK, 10 seconds is 1/6 minute.
So, you need a concentration of about 12000mg/m**3, or 12g/m**3.  135,000
cubic meters would make the total requirement 1620kg.  Each 27g of product
requires  75.4g of starting material, roughly 3:1.  So, you\'d need about
4.8 metric tons in order to produce something approaching an instantly lethal
dose over the entire interior of the ship, not counting filter effects,
length of time needed for air circulation, etc...doesn\'t sound too likely
to me.

Much too steep.

Well, I\'d refigure some numbers to be sure, but it doesn\'t look very practical.
Depends on how much of the ship you really need to contaminate, and how fast
you think the crew could respond.  For comparison, I looked up the lethal
dose (LCt50) of Sarin, a common nerve gas invented in World War II, and rather
than being 2000-4500 mg-min/m**3 for HCN, it\'s more like _70_mg-min/m**3.
Almost 30 times more lethal...so instead of a few tons you\'d only need
about 9.45 kilograms to deliver a lethal dose in one minute.  Air mixing
and filters, of course, remain a problem.  Now, some biotoxins are _much_
more toxic than Sarin--something like poison arrow frog venom from South
America is 10,000 times more lethal than Sarin, but it is usually delivered
by injection.  I see a note that says that mixing it with scorpion venom
increases its toxicity by a factor of 20...

Given an SF universe, you could probably come up with something almost
arbitrarily lethal, although imposing severe handling precautions would
be in  order!

Rob Dean

(Additional note: HCN is lighter than air at room temperature, so given some
warning, you could engage in defensive measures like dropping to the floor and
cranking the grav-plates up to 2-Gs to encourage it to concentrate at the
ceiling, and it\'s also very soluble in water, meaning that a wet rag over the
breathing orifices would probably provide _some_ filtering effect.)

Duchess of Glisten class Freighter TL13

     The Duchess of Glisten class freighters were built by LSP at Strouden
for a small shipping firm between 1050 and 1074.  27 of the ships were com-
pleted, and 22 remain in service in 1120, with the remainder having been lost
due to accident or military action in the Fourth and Fifth Frontier Wars.
The details shown below are for the ships as originally completed.  Most of
the survivors have acquired weaponry, and fuel scoops are a commonly added
feature.  The original computer and control installation was sufficient for
adding up to MCr6 worth of weapons, with three triple turrets each mounting a
sandcaster, a missile rack, and a beam laser being the most popular configu-
ration.  The fourth stateroom is occasionally used by a paying passenger, but
is more likely to be found serving as additional accommodation for the gun-
ners and possible medic added to the crew when the vessel is armed.
     Jump-3 capability combined with a 2-plus-G maneuver drive allows a
Duchess of Glisten class vessel to engage in ground-to-ground service between
most starports. A fuel purifier eases operations among class C and lower
ports, and the airframe hull allows for rapid atmospheric travel between
multiple ports on a single world where this would be desirable (i.e. if the
local transportation infrastructure was inadequate to haul cargo between
ports in a timely manner).

Cryshawk class Gunboat TL13

     The Cryshawk class gunboat is a small, jump-capable vessel intended for
a wide range of small craft duties, including close orbital support and
convoy escort on routes not exceeding Jump-2.  Originally developed for the
Imperial Navy during the Civil Wars, the design has been a standard IDP
available for planetary and regional navies for over three hundred years.
Due to their low crew requirements, Cryshawks are often found as extra ships
in starmerc organizations.

                      THE 4.5TH COLUMNISTS
                               by
                          Scott Kellogg
                             - IL -
     Five Swordfish II\'s of Kangaroo squadron screamed in on the
particle accelerator batteries with their anti-ship pulse lasers
licking away at the armored emplacements, gouging scars in the
heavy superdense.
     Eight Shtelfires came climbing up the Swordfish II\'s tails.
A growling note sounded in the pilot\'s ears as their missile\'s
seeker heads locked onto the data fed from the Shtel\'s sensor
arrays.  Three missiles leapt from each Shtel toward the wildly
jinking Swordfish II\'s.
     Most of the missiles went wide, but three found their way to
their targets.  In a small flash, one of the Swordfish lost all
power and plowed a deep furrow in the ground.  A second Swordfish,
wildly evading one missile, veered right into the path of a second
missile and blew the cockpit off.  The third missile ripped a
Fish\'s turret off, taking the fighter\'s computer systems with it
leaving a plate of twisted metal, plastic and diamond semiconductor
spaghetti:  she was maimed, but alive, close enough to the ground
to spit at it.
     The three survivors pulled away from the barren surface.
     The eight Shtels closed in for the kill.
     But the Shtels luck was turning as the five Swordfish I\'s of
Rabbit squadron bore in on the climbing Shtels.
     Kangaroos chased by Shtels chased by Rabbits.  The surface of
Zylath was the site of the largest 6G carousel as the three groups
went into a defensive wheel formation.
     The Kangaroos laser turrets turned to bear on their attackers
while the Rabbits fired their missiles catching their opponents in
a Shtelfire sandwich.  But against the superior electronic
countermeasures of the Shtels computers, the vollies found no
marks.
     The Shtels missiles streaked after the surviving Kangaroos but
the pilots were fully alerted to the defensive now, and were ready
for the launch.  Not a missile came close to the twisting
Kangaroos.
     The fight was too even.
     The stalemate was broken as five Swordfish I\'s of Dingo
squadron blazed in to tip the balance.  They swooped into the
circle of fire and lit off their missiles.
     The outnumbered Shtels weren\'t ready for the onslaught.  One
Shtel vaporized.  Another went out of control as the cockpit
shattered under the force of the blast.
     The Shtelfires fired another salvo of missiles on the fleeing
Kangaroo squadron and broke off.  The crippled Swordfish II
crumpled under her second hit while another sailed on into the
blackness without power.
                              - L -
     "Grahl, Ancients!  Am I glad to see you!  I thought cha\' were
one of them!"  Gresha waved the group into the garage with an
automatic.  She still looked ill from the radiation serum, but was
on her feet.  "We\'ll never fit the Tilly\'s into the grav
ambulance."
     Jiet nodded.  "Yes.  They\'ll have to ride on the outside."
     "Where the gvresh are we going?"
     "We\'ve gotta get back to the Flamboyant." growled Jiet.
"She\'s too well guarded so we go for their armory first and get
loaded for bear!"
     Gresha counted and came up one short, "Where\'s Kfoks?"
     "Out on the surface somewhere." growled Tuerz.
                             - LI -
     The Battleaxe\'s cutter swung low over Kfoks\'s head and settled
on the surface with the modular bay swung open.  Quickly, a Kuum
grav armored personnel carrier dropped out.  The cutter, relieved
of it\'s precious cargo climbed back up at full power.
     With no prelude, the APC swung round and bore down on Kfoks
with her clamshell doors wide open.
     The Tilly clumped over and climbed into the Kuum\'s cargo
space, the armored bulk barely fit as the clamshells closed.  Kfoks
was jounced as the APC took off in a nape of the ground flight.
     "Welcome aboard, mate."
                             - LII -
     Niedrsha slowly lifted the grav ambulance and began guiding
her for the armory.  "Miakr?  You sure you can get us in the armory
from that account?"
     Miakr nodded "No question.  This account looks like it
belonged to their main supply officer.  Got their whole inventory."
     Niedrsha frowned, "Whole inventory...  Ummm, Jiet.  Just
thought of something..."
     Jietlshaiepr, in the midst of examining her bandaged arm,
looked up, "What?"
     "These bastards are pretty sore losers, right?"
     "Yeah?"
     "Suicide capsules, the whole bit."  Niedrsha exhaled sharply,
"So, what happens if they figure they\'re losin\'?"
     "Mmmm...  They\'ll throw a party and get bombed out their
minds."
     Niedrsha nodded.  "Well, that\'s one party I can afford to
miss."
     Shtam turned to Miakr, "Can you get into the Flamboyant\'s
systems from here?"
     Miakr checked the hand computer.  "Ummm...  I think so..."
     "Do it.  I want the systems running through the emergency
automatic checklist for take off.  We may have to get out of here
in a hurry."
     Miakr nodded.  "Okay.  I\'m on it."
                            - LIII -
     High in orbit, Lt. Dragoon sat on the bridge of the Burke
sulking.  The main body of the task force was down in close laying
orbital fire support, and here she was up in high guard position
twiddling her thumbs.
     Nothing on sensors out there, "Damn orders!" she growled.
Great opportunity to get in action, and here she was guarding the
task force from it\'s own... shadow...
     ...Shadow?  Hmmm... that\'s the second time that sensor glitch
appeared...  She crossed her fingers and grinned.  Maybe there
*was* something out here to fight...
     Dragoon flicked the toggle safety off the active sensors.
Let\'s see if anybody\'s home...
     "Energizing active EMS!  Targeting...  Bogie...  Negative...
She\'s a bandit!"
     Dragoon kicked the throttle over.  "Burke to task force.  Have
identified a Ninz class scout.  Closing to engage."
     "Gunner!  Weapon\'s free!  Ram a nuke down that bastard\'s
throat!"
     Two missiles leapt from the Burke\'s racks and flashed off into
the darkness.  Almost immediately the Ninz returned fire.  The
missiles arced across the blackness passing within mere kilometers
of each other on opposite courses.
     One of the Burke\'s missiles flew wide.  The second connected
with the onrushing Ninz.  The detonation gave Zylath a second sun
for a millisecond as pieces of the Ninz scattered across the high
orbit of the small planet.
     Separated from the umbilical cord of guiding maser beams, the
Ninz\'s missiles sought the Burke on their own power, but without
the Ninz\'s computer to help them, they were easily sidestepped by
Dragoon\'s pirouettes.
                             - LIV -
     Miakr looked up from the hand computer.  "I\'ve got the
Flamboyant chewing on the checklist.  Five minutes \'till power
plant start up.  Got ship\'s sensors going.  Looks like about
sixteen of those robots outside guarding her."
     Shtam grinned. "Good.  Now can you make a data transfer to the
Flamboyant from here?"
     "Yeah..."
     "Do it:  all the data you can get.  If a lot of shipping went
through here, we might be able to get an idea of where it came
from, and where it was going."
     "Ok..."
     Shtam took a deep breath.  "With luck we may even find out
where they have shipped Dr. Malenkoviepr..."
     An alarm sounded on the ambulance radio.  "Alert!  Alert!
Enemy troops have breached the starport landing bay!  Blazer
Company, divert to landing bay!"
                             - LV -
     The Kuum APC entered the glowing hole in the starport airlock.
She flew over the blasted carcass of one of her fellows as a plasma
bolt streamed by missing by a meter.  A second bolt scorched the
APC\'s armored hull, rocking the thirty seven ton mass slightly.
The APC\'s VRF gauss gun locked on the source of the blasts and
chewed the plasma gunner in half.
     The Kuum\'s doors swung open.  Sergeant Tucker screamed "GO!
GO!  GO!" and jumped as two fire teams of marines leaped out and
into firing positions.
     Gauss needles began arcing over the scene as Kfoks dropped out
of the cargo bay to join the Sergeant under the cover of the
blasted Kuum.
     "I\'ll lay down covering fire." shouted Kfoks, "You move yer
men up!"
     Tucker\'s helmet nodded.
     Kfoks popped up and blazed fusing plasma over the source of
the annoyance.
     "MOVE IT!  MOVE IT!  MOVE IT!"
                             - LVI -
     Eight Shtelfires screamed toward the body of the task force.
Quickly they began unloading their missile racks, sending off
salvoes to the League of Suns ships, concentrated on the Machete.
     The mercenary cruiser\'s lasers swung round to engage the
closing missiles managing to pick off three of the pursuing probing
salvoes.  Three more slammed into the Machete\'s spherical hull.
Her heavy bulk was shaken by three nuclear explosions.
     Hydrogen fuel streamed off into the vacuum in a giant cloud of
gas.  Fifty tons of hydrogen and bits of lanathnum plasma formed a
freezing, burning sphere around the stricken ship.
     The task force quickly shifted targets to avenge the strike.
A fusillade of destruction caught the Shtel\'s, blowing seven of the
eight from the black skies of Zylath.
     In desperation, the last Shtel fired off a second salvo of
missiles at the Machete and ran.  The combined batteries of the
entire task force blazed after the fleeing fighter which vaporized
under the heavy abuse.
     The second missile salvo, now without guidance from the
Shtel\'s computers blinked for a second and found the target on
their own.  The missile detonated on target.  The Machete\'s
computers were awash in a sea of radiation.  The electromagnetic
pulse blew the connections to the diamond semiconductor chips
arcing and melting the systems around it.
                            - LVII -
     The heavy blast door to the armory lifted open to admit the
ambulance.  The reunited PPO2\'s swept into the room while Kaezorr
and Rackan in the Tilly\'s dropped off the outside of the ambulance
and swung round looking for...
     ...Nothing?
     The armory was unguarded.
     "Looks like we had a convenient diversion!" sighed
Jietlshaiepr.  The crew climbed out of the ambulance to look on the
stockpile.
     The bunker was overflowing with an orgy of ordnance.
Conventional missiles stood in row upon row upon row.  Missile
booster stages stood awaiting their unconventional warheads stored
in different safe bins, nuclear, biological, chemical.  Death
harnessed and imprisoned in tiny containers labeled with bright
colors and garish designs.  All waiting impatiently for someone to
loose their collars.
     Racks of gauss rifles stood ready.  A plethora of plasma guns,
loads of lasers, rows of rocket launchers, cases of caseless ammo,
mounds of ammunition, heaps of HEAP all competed for space on the
floor of the stockpile.
     Shtam surveyed the army of armaments, "There are enough
munitions here to supply an entire invasion.  You could refit a
fleet of ships with all this."
     "Yeah," agreed Niedrsha, "but who\'s fleet?  And where are they
bound?"
     "They will be invading the Domain of Alentzar." answered
Shtam.  "Zylath is a good strategic position."
     "Somebody\'s planning a Big party..." Observed Tuerz.
     "Nuclear rounds..." Jietlshaiepr raised an eyebrow, "Let\'s
make *sure* all they do is *plan* that party."
                            - LVIII -
     A team of cargobots edged into the landing bay of the
Flamboyant carrying seven heavy cargo containers.  The sergeant in
charge of the squad guarding the ship strode over to them as they
headed for the ship\'s cargo lock which opened to greet them.
     "What\'s this?" he asked suspiciously.
     The robot cargo master did not slow.  "Work order niner zero
seven three two charlie.  Load cargo containers:  delta one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight into docked ship via aft cargo
bay."
     "Who authorized this?  I wasn\'t notified."
     "Work order niner zero seven three two charlie comes from
Supply Officer Carton."
     The sergeant sighed, better not question it.  Carton was a
real bastard sometimes:  the stupid and officious type.  He didn\'t
realize that Carton was hardly likely to bother him again as his
brains were currently spread over the walls of one of the bunker\'s
terminal rooms.
     "Proceed."
     The robots hurried about the task of loading the eight crates.
                             - LIX -
     Miakr opened the crate and jumped out as soon as the cargo
door boomed shut.  "It worked!"
     Jiet crawled carefully out of the crate with Niedrsha\'s help.
"Good going.  Ok crew.  Man your stations.  We\'re getting out of
here."
     Tuerz growled mutinously.  "We aren\'t leaving."
     "What?"
     "Taek is still out there."
     Jietlshaiepr eyed Tuerz angrily and growled, "We\'re going to
get him.  We don\'t leave anyone behind.  Now, get to your station
mister!"
     Tuerz ears drooped and he retreated, his tail curled slightly
between his legs.
                             - LX -
     "Power is up!" called Shtam from engineering.
     Jietlshaiepr sat nervously on the bridge.  She watched as
Miakr fed firing orders to the turret computers.  Sixteen troops in
the outside bay, six lasers in two turrets.  "Ready Miakr?" she
asked.
     Miakr continued working "Just a second more... ok...  ok..."
He brightened, "All fed in."
     Jietlshaiepr turned to her lover at the pilot\'s station,
"Ready Niedrsha?"
     "Checklists complete.  Ready for take off."
     Jietlshaiepr set her jaw.  "Right.  Gunnery stations to
automatic control.  Commence fire on my mark."
     She drew a deep breath and sat back in her chair.  "MARK!"
     The laser turrets swept round and fired on low power.  Six one
megawatt beams of photons surgically removed the targets standing
in the landing bay.  It was over in a tenth of a second.  The last
was hit before the first had even started to crumple.
     Jietlshaiepr grinned.  "Ok, Miakr open that door!"
     The heavy bay doors began to open sending the air out into the
vacuum in a typhoon.
     Suddenly, the doors stopped dead and began to close.
     They\'d been detected.
     The laser turrets swung round and began chewing on the bay
doors.  The turrets began to draw their full power and the heavy
armored doors began to puddle on the floor.  The glare shields went
up in the flamboyant as one point five gigawatts of energy blazed
away at the doors.
     The laser\'s shut off.
     The glare shields cut out.
     The crew watched as the glowing metal doors fell slowly to the
ground in the low gravity of Zylath.
     Niedrsha grinned and pulled up on the collective as the
Flamboyant slowly lifted vertically and eased out through the hole
she\'d carved.
                             - LXI -
     "Captain!  Picking up new target!"
     Stewart growled, "Identify!"
     "Sensors make her out as a Fiery class gunned escort."
     "Cud\' be th\' Flamboyant." Lt. Jones interjected.
     "Picking up their masercom."
     Stewart raised an eyebrow.  "Put \'em on."
     Miakr\'s voice came over the link, "...of Suns task force, this
is the Flamboyant come in..."
     "This is Commander Stewart.  Go ahead Flamboyant."
     "Do your fire!  Repeat, do not fire!  We\'re on your side!
Hold on..."
     Jietlshaiepr\'s voice replaced Miakr on the circuit.
"Commander Stewart, if you\'ve got troops down there you\'d better
get them out, now!  These folks are known for their scorched ground
policy."
     Stewart started to speak when Lt. Jones interrupted him.
"Leftenant Jietlshaiepr, this is Leftenant Jones.  How are Miakr\'s
stitches?"
     Stewart eyed Jones critically, but kept his mouth shut.
*These bloody intell types!*
     Jietlshaiepr hesitated on the line, "Ummm... fine.  He
recovered quickly considering...  Mind you I had to clean up your
work, but not bad over all."
     "Ye\' cleaned up *My* work?  Ye\'..." Jones grimaced, "Yeah,
Commander, it\'s them.  Think we\'d better get th\' men back \'ere
quick.  If there\'s a bomb, it\'s a mother of all bombs..."
                            - LXII -
     The center of town was a dead vacuum when the recall order
came.  All the air had leaked out through the blast holes from the
fire fight.  The defenders were being driven back slowly and not
without cost.
     Tucker and Kfoks fazed back covering the retreat back to the
APC\'s at the landing bay with a wall of plasma.
     The defenders had holed up in a large building.  At first they
thought the cease fire was another ruse while the attackers dropped
back to switch to a probing attack.
     Find the weak points.
     It took them some time to realize that their adversaries were
pulling out.  Had they beaten them off?  Or was it a trick?
     A minute later they came out ready to counter attack.
     They caught up with the troops loading in their APC\'s.  Gauss
needles splintered off the hulls and cutting down one of the
marines.  His combat armor leaking away air and blood.
     A bolt of fusing plasma drove the counter attack back
momentarily, but they had seen the marines were in retreat.  Now
they could really smash them as they sought to escape.
     Suddenly, a new form hovered through the smashed landing bay
doors.
     The triangular wedge of the Flamboyant came through.
     Jietlshaiepr\'s voice came over the circuit.  "Hey!  Kfoks!
You order a pizza?"
     Kfoks barked over the radio "GrraSH!  Team am I glad to see
you!"
     "You want this pizza or not?"
     Kfoks barked a laugh, "HARF!  Sure!  Got my laser designator,
deliver it to this address, and don\'t forget the anchovies!"  Kfoks
laser welder shined over the target where the defenders were
gathering their strength.
     "On the way!  Flamboyant\'s delivers!"
     The ship\'s lasers came up again at low power melting away the
rubble and smashing up the cover the defenders needed.
     "So long, Tucker!" called Kfoks, "Thanks for the lift, but I
got my own ride home now!"
     "G\'day Kfoks!  Fun workin\' w\' ye!"
     Kfoks clumped heavily across the pad and climbed into the
Flamboyant\'s cargo hold.  Inside, he punched the hatch close and
howled to the bridge.  "HAAAROOO!  Niedrsha!  Get us outta here!"
     "On the way!" Niedrsha called.
     The Flamboyant lifted, spun around and headed for space.

Matthew, the official GDW books on Classic Traveller are as follows:

8 rule books
13 supplements (number 5 not sold in stores)
13 adventures
6 double adventures
8 alien modules
5 boxed supplement games: MAYDAY, SNAPSHOT, AZHANTI HIGH LIGHTNING
  (which includes Supplement 5), INVASION: EARTH, and STRIKER
2 boxed adventure packages: TARSUS and BELTSTRIKE
2 large-format books, the TRAVELLER BOOK and THE TRAVELLER ADVENTURE
3 "special supplements" bound into the JTAS
3 Large-format stand-alone books: ATLAS OF THE IMPERIUM, THE SPINWARD

toxin (which was some god-awful number of deaths per teaspoon, I believe on
the order of hundreds of thousands?) and Arsenic Trioxide (50,000 deaths per
teaspoon).  He said something on the order of "Now we don\'t go spreading
Botulism around but Arsenic Trioxide is widely used as a pesticide".

You can tell from my qualifying statements,  that I don\'t have the article in

    'body' => 'I am afraid that I am going to have to give up on the TML -- I
thought maybe some of you would be interested in my reasons why,
so I thought I\'d post this last public note about it.  I
probably won\'t be able to see your responses unless you e-mail
them directly to me :-).

Essentially, I\'m leaving the TML because I no longer have any
real interest in Traveller.  There\'s two major reasons for this:

First, it has become clear that GDW is an organization that I
don\'t want to support, even indirectly.  Somehow, the premise
that "the customer is always right" seems to have been
completely forgotten by a corporation which, when all is said
and done, is entirely dependent on the goodwill of its
customers.  When the president of a company *publicly* threatens
to sue one of the company\'s own customers, who has voluntarily
contributed a great deal to the company\'s product, it *doesn\'t
matter* whether the man has a legitimate gripe or not -- I\'m
going to stay as far away from that company as possible.

In case you haven\'t yet guessed, I won\'t be buying any GDW
products, Traveller or otherwise, and I will encourage my
friends to follow suit.  But I also feel that any minute
contribution I make to the continued success of Traveller via
my participation in the TML also indirectly supports GDW,
inasmuch as it is selling its products under the Traveller name.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, "Traveller" is unplayable
by novices such as myself.  I reach this conclusion reluctantly,
but I reach it nonetheless.  Consider that there are now 3
"official" versions of Traveller!  The first of these has
itself perhaps 2 dozen supplements which are apparently such an
important part of the game that they are difficult to do
without.  The result of all this richness of rules and settings
is, for me at least, a system into which it is impossible to
bootstrap myself without a *massive* investment of time and
energy.

Consider that the only Traveller I\'ve ever played was original
Traveller in the pre-Imperium setting 10 years ago.  Imagine my
shock when, 6 years later, I decided to buy, read, and
understand enough source materials to run a Traveller
campaign.  I made a vague effort, but with 2 different versions
and all those supplements and the whole Imperial History to
deal with and a million "well understood Ancient technologies"
and 50 kinds of "well known" aliens and ...  Bleah.

It\'s a wonderful universe, but *all the important bits need to
be in one self-contained book*.  I really don\'t care if that
book is actually 3 volumes of 500 pages each, and costs $150.
I just want to be able to buy it, read it, and be ready to run a
Traveller game with fairly experienced players without making a
fool of myself.  While it would seem that I could do this with
MT+MC (MegaCorrections :-) or TNE, most of the Traveller
players I am familiar with rely so extensively on material not
from these sources that they would be uncomfortable with my
refusal to honor this material.

I submit that this is the big attraction of some of the
cyberjunk games that hit the market a couple years back; not
the teen-angst, not the cool cover art, but just the fact that
you shelled out your $100 up front and were ready to play with
your experienced friends for a long time.  In fact, I would
have bought one of those systems *but* for the fact that I
don\'t particularly enjoy roleplaying in that genre.

(I\'m afraid I must add that a minor third reason for leaving
the list is a certain participant, who, in spite of obvious and
deep familiarity with Traveller and respect from the Traveller
community, seems remarkably juvenile and egocentric.  I mustn\'t
name names, but it will be a relief not to read any more of
this participant\'s messages.)

So in all sadness and dismay, I must sign off.  I will
certainly miss the intelligent discussion, the lighthearted
fun, and the passionate commitment to FRP gaming expressed by
most members of this list, but I\'m going to go look for some
more viable sci-fi game to run.  Thanks to most all of you for
your help and support!

P.S. -- I am not a lawyer, but I think I understand intellectual
property law at least a little.  GDW can copyright texts, but
not just names.  Thus, "Gauss Rifle" or "Zhodani" or even
"Imperium", in and of themselves are not copyrightable.  They
*are* protectable, but by *trademark*.  And these names are
either not trademarked or their trademarks are not protected (I
think -- have you seen any GDW publications with "Vargr(TM)"
anywhere in them?)  So if your story has "Aslan" in it, this is
perfectly fine.  In addition, one cannot protect intellectual
concepts.  Thus, I can write a story "set in the universe" of
Traveller with impunity, as long as I don\'t use copyrighted
texts in the story, or infringe on trademarked names, or violate
any contractual agreements I may have with GDW.  Publish away --
I believe the lawyers will just laugh at GDW, for all their
hollow threats.

Now there is such a thing as "game copyright", which says that
I can\'t publish a game just like Monopoly except with the names
of everything changed, or a game which uses many of the same
names used in Monopoly.  This form of copyright has been
interpreted very loosely by the courts, so if you use any of
the gaming rules of Traveller in your published materials, or
if you publish gaming rules yourself, you must be very
careful...

expounded at length about starrport mapping and construction, and how
starports affect commerce etc.  There *might* be something useful there.

Generally - are you looking at the starport, the star town, or or the
native city?  Do you want an adventure milieu or information on how
traffic will be sequenced, landed, and stored?

articles -chk ]

StutterWarp drives are great; I can\'t see any reason (including safety) for
not using them over even jump drives.

RANGE:
The stutterwarp distance limit is 7.7ly; if I remember correctly, that\'s
about Jump-2. If you don\'t stop in a >0.1G gravity well at this distance,
then the ship is bathed in lethal radiation, yes, but:

There are few areas of space surrounding Terra that are unreachable at the
7.7ly limit. Increasing this limit even slightly makes the set of stars
surrounding Terra completely connected.

Even in 2300AD several different options are being explored to extend the
range:

- - stuttertugs - drag one ship with another to 3.8ly, then assemble the towed
  ship\'s drive and continue; this extends the range to 11.5ly. At 11.5ly
  there are no unreachable areas in the 2300AD starcharts.

- - brown dwarves - these are very difficult to detect, but once found may be
  used to discharge like any other gravity well. Two of these, of strategic
  importance, have been found by the American Space Forces (although I won\'t
  say where they are :-)

- - extended range - a competent engineering crew can delay the discharge time
  by up to one full day. even a slow ship travels at 2ly/day, giving an
  effective range of 9.7ly when necessary; again this distance completely
  connects the known stars.

- - extended range II - There is evidence to suggest that the 7.7ly limit is
  not a hard limit; there are rumours that one of our Alien neighbours has a
  stutterwarp drive with a longer range...


SPEED:
As has been pointed out previously, any reasonable StutterWarp equipped ship
is *fast*; anywhere from Jump-2 to Jump-9 equivalent, with the additional
bonus that it doesn\'t take a week to make every link; instead travel time
depends on distance travelled.

COMBAT:
StutterWarp equipped ships are untouchable by anything other than faster
StutterWarp equipped ships/weapons. It is trivial to outrun anything slower
than you, and it is exceedingly difficult to hit a stutterwarping target at
the best of times. (The reason that weapons do so little damage in 2300AD is
not because they\'re wimpy. Instead, it\'s because of the techniques used to
counteract StutterWarp; you fire a laser in a wide spread at where the
target should be, and hope that one or more individual bursts hits the
target. So, only fraction of the energy pumped into a weapon is actually
striking the target).

Non-energy weapons are useless against StutterWarping ships; you simply
can\'t hit an object that isn\'t in normal space most of the distance it
travels:

A StutterWarping ship is leaping through space. The drive cycles at a
certain frequency, and at each cycle the ship "jumps" to a new location,
*without crossing the intervening space*. The stutterwarp frequency isn\'t
specified, but at 10kHz the distance travelled is 21900km/cycle, and even at
1 GHz the distance travelled is 219m/cycle. It\'s exceedingly unlikely that a
StutterWarping ship is going to hit an object in it\'s path.

A StutterWarping ship retains it\'s realspace velocity vector, so even if it
were to impact an object in it\'s path, it would do so at whatever it\'s
current realspace velocity is, so it\'s unlikely to take much damage from the
collision.

Ships without StutterWarp drives are sitting ducks...


Why would anyone want a Jump drive instead of a StutterWarp drive?

Personally, *IF* Frank Chadwick had had a legitimate complaint, then I
for one (and probably many others) would feel differently.  As it was,
Scott Kellogg was being slightly hot-headed; while Frank Chadwick\'s
response was completely uncalled-for.  However, this does not seem
a serious enough offense to warrant a complete boycott.

Traveller is indeed an unplayable game, and it has been ever since
MegaTraveller was published (Classic Traveller is unplayable because it
is out of print, and MegaTraveller because it is a complete mess).  TNE
may fix this, although I have some considerable doubts.

Whether or not you could collect enough of the Classic Traveller
materials to play a campaign, I\'m not sure.  The list below describes
the materials I would recommend for someone like you:

The Traveller Book [preferred] or Books 1-3 [which you may have]
The Classic Traveller basic rules.  Copies of The Traveller Book
may still be available from some stores (Crazy Igors, or A
Wargamers\' Depot, amoung others).  If you have Books 1-3 from
Basic Traveller or Deluxe Traveller, you can use them, but The
Traveller Book is a better editing job, and easier to read.

The Traveller Adventure
This is a complete campaign for Classic Traveller.  Much of the
background data you want is included in this book; I also
know for a fact that copies are still available from some
stores (A Wargamers\' Depot has several copies of the softbound
version in stock).  Even if you decide not to run the campaign,
there are many adventure ideas contained in here, and a lot of
background material is presented in a rather painless way.

These two books were designed to work together, as a coherent set, and
were probably the closest GDW ever got to presenting a cohesive,
canonical Traveller.  They probably contain over 70% of the  body of
knowledge that makes up "Classic Traveller".

If at all possible, pick up copies of Book 4 and Book 5; these provide
more detailed Army and Navy characters, and are Classic Traveller
staples.  Book 6 and Book 7 do the same for Scout and Merchant
characters, but these were written relatively late in the Classic
Traveller period, and have had much less influence.  Another possibility
would be to use the character generation section of the MegaTraveller
Players\' Handbook, which seems to be substantially unchanged from the
final systems used by Classic Traveller (save for the addition of
typographical errors which were not present in the earlier versions).

I would also try to locate copies of the following suppliments: The
Spinward Marches, and the two Library Data suppliments.  With a few
exceptions, most of my Traveller playing and refereeing was done with
not much more material than what I describe above (the exceptions being
Citizens of The Imperium, 76 Patrons, Animal Encounters, and the Journal
of the Travellers\' Aid Society).  While a goodly amount of material came
from the Journal, much of it made its way into the Best of The Journal
volumes (which may also be available at some stores).  The other three
are contained to a greater or lesser degree in The Traveller Book, or
can be re-created with not too much referee effort.

One of the best parts about buying second-hand or out-of-print books
(other than being able to get them for much less money than new
material) is that GDW has already been paid for them, usually a long
time ago.  GDW neither knows nor cares that you are purchasing Classic
Traveller materials.

I agree with you.  Unfortunately, it\'s not going to happen; Classic
Traveller is dead at GDW (save for those who want to revise and retcon
it out of existance).

I for one am sorry to see you go, and sad that you feel this way.
However, it is your decision to make and your game to referee.

You may want to take a look at Steve Jackson\'s GURPS, and take a good
hard look at BTRC\'s TimeLords/WarpWorld/SpaceTime games.

Whatever you decide to do, fare thee well!

Startports.  My primary complaint is that whereas there is a World Builder\'s
Handbook, and a COACC book, now there are even rules for Seagoing vessels of
the 14th century, there are relatively few rules for Starports.  Here is a
very incomplete compendium of what I can remember offhand:

For Classic Trav (still useful in MT):
Judges Guild - 50 Starbases.  The first half is somewhat useful.  They suggest
   that \'high\' ports be broken down into:  Orbital Docks
   Orbital Ports
   Orbital Cities
   In addition, there is a basic, standard, and extended version of each.  There
   are also some rules suggestions for navigation beacons, and 20 short tables
   to generate local \'color\' for any starport.  The second half consists of some
   50 undocumented starport maps.  Some of these look like they could be adapted
   for realistic use, most do not.  Worth getting, provided you don\'t pay more
   that $10 for it.  It\'s been out of print for years, but suprisingly easy to
   find.

Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society #19:  The Skyport Authority.  Mercenary-
   style character generation for the people who work at Starports.  Can be
   directly used in MT, as this corresponds to advanced character generation.
   Good for generating NPC\'s, but that\'s about all.  Out of print, but it can
   be found.

Dragon #59(?):  Exonidas Starport.  A pull out for Traveller, detailing
   adventure situations in and around an extensive type A starport.  Out of
   print, but many game shops stock Dragon back issues.  Check to make sure
   the pull out is still inside before you buy.

High Passage/Far Traveller:  The Port Authority.  A series of short articles
   by J. Keith on the ins and outs of starship regulation, including
   transponders, merchant convoys, inward clearance, restricted planets, and
   communications channels.  Very useful, but out of print and extremely hard
   to find.

Adventure Class Ships Vol. II:  The Orbital Facility.  A deckplan for a small
   orbital facility.  Useful either as the a complete extended orbital dock,
   or as a portion of a more extensive facility.  Out of print, extremely hard
   to find.

Best of the Journal Vol. 2:  Startown.  A brief discussion of the red-light
   district that seems to grow up around Starports across the Imperium.

Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society #7:  Can\'t remember the title of the
   article, but it was a discussion of a \'typical\' type A starport.

There are also brief discussions of starports in the Traveller Book.

For MegaTraveller:
Far & Away #1:  Two articles by J. Keith on rules for Starports.  Quite useful,
   but this magazine didn\'t sell well for some reason, and it may be hard to
   find this issue.

There are more, of course, but I can\'t remember the details.  I will post a
more complete listing later.  Now, as to my problem.  Even possessing all of
the above mentioned \'hard to find\', \'out of print\' documents, I still don\'t
really think I know a lot about Starports.  Most of these were short magazine
articles.  What I am interested in is a sort of Port Authority Handbook, with a
summary of pre-Rebellion Imperial Port Authority policies.  If such rules don\'t
exist, I perhaps could work on producing some of my own, but if they do exist,
well, I have graduate school to worry about.

In addition, any suggestions for references I didn\'t mention, or examples from
your own campaigns are welcome.  Please e-mail me.

Just one second...  (Zipppp).  Asbestos suit on.  I must refuse any requests
for photocopies of the above out-of-print documents, unless you can provide
me with photocopies of some other out-of-print document I am looking for.

> YES. BUT. What you want is highly processed/refined resources.

To have a successful starship repair or construction business, you need
access to the following resources:
  1) a reliable supply of parts and materials
       a) local sources: the yard can be located on an industrialized,
          high-tech world which can mass produce the needed items on
          demand.  Inventory can be small or nonexistant to keep costs
          low; custom work is easily done by letting subcontracts.
       b) if local sources are not available, parts can be imported
          from off-world suppliers.  The inventory must be large, with
          the attendant costs.  Custom or non-standard parts may be
          effectively unavailable at any price.
  2) a pool of skilled labor (designers, engineers, techs, etc)
       a) local sources: labor can be hired locally from a pool of
          skilled workers; compensation must be competitive, but
          no special provisions need be made.
       b) if no skilled local labor is available, then
            i) train promising local workers in high-tech skills.
               High initial costs for training, but compensation costs
               less than equivalent workers on a more advanced
               world.  May result in technology transfer to local
               culture (which may be desirable or undesirable depending
               on local circumstances).
           ii) recruit workers from a more advanced world to work at
               the facility.  Compensation may need to be high in order
               to attract workers for work distant from their home
               planet.  Housing or other facilities may need to be
               built depending on the local conditions.
  3) a steady flow of paying customers.  An analysis of the shipbuilding
     equilibrum equation shows that annual maintainance is the majority
     of any shipyard\'s workload (the 4+T/L term is the relevant porton
     of the equiation; 4 weeks/year is the maintainance requirement,
     while T/L weeks/year is the construction requirement).  Even in the
     extreme case of million-ton ships, construction is 43%, and annual
     maintainance is 57%.  For more reasonable cases (average ship size
     of 5,000 tons), the ratio is 31% to 69% (both of these assume an
     average ship life of 80 years).


Last week, I wrote (mea culpa):
> The equilibrum equation is X=(U*(N+M))/(4+(T/L)) and the condition is

There are two problems with the above.  First of all, a line should be:
T == Ship Construction Time == 48 weeks for a 200 ton ship
and due to rounding/truncation errors, X (which is in aggregate tons)
should be X = 109,688 aggregate tons, or about 548 200 ton ships.
Sorry about that, folks!

In the real world right now, almost any country that is significant in
any way to the "outside world" is TL5+; I would argue that this is not a
valid comparison.  Instead, let\'s look into the past, when TL3 was the
most advanced technology on the planet.

OK, well let\'s take a look at what TL3 means: Rifled firearms, calculus,
telegraph, clipper ships.  Hot air balloons, and basic electricity are
all recent developments; the MT Referee\'s handbook gives circa 1800 as a
capsule description.

That sounds rather like the shape of the world from roughly the American
Revolution to the turn of the century.  Many areas of the world, in
particular the colonial empires of the major powers, produced sufficient
quantities of food for export.  The primary problems of the age were a
lack of refrigeration (so that only non-perishable food could be
shipped), a lack of bulk overland transportation (goods had to be
shipped by sailing ship), and a lack of mechanized labor.  This last is
the most crippling, from a food production standpoint.

In the case of Motet, I would argue that there is TL4 equipment (steam
power machinery) on the world, but that it is all imported.  Probably
the equipment was designed and produced on Madrigal specifically for
export to TL3-4 agricultural work.  Steam power has the advantage that
it is a simpler technology, operating at lower speeds, tempratures, and
pressures than internal combustion. Although produced offworld, the
technology is simple enough that a TL3 blacksmith can perform many of
the most common repairs.  The equipment is also rugged, long-lived, and
easily understood.

The reason Motet is still classified as TL3 is because the steam
technology is imported - Motet lacks the mines, smelters, foundrys, and
machine shops needed to produce these things locally.  I would further
argue that Motet is poor in native mineral resouces, particularly readily
exploitable metal ores (this being the reason that the world remains at
TL3 even though higher-tech knowledge is available).

As an aside, about a month ago, I watched a 70+ year old Case steam
traction engine thresh a wagonload of wheat.  It took 5 men, one steam
tractor, and one 40+ year old thresher less than half an hour to thresh
a wagonload of wheat.  It took about another half hour to bale the
straw.  The steam tractor is almost all iron in construction, and can in
theory be expected to last indefinitely as long as ordinary maintainance
is kept up.  The thresher is mostly wooden, and will not last as long.
There is even older steam machinery still operable; at the same place I
saw an operating 1903 model; operating steam railroad locomotives well
over 100 years old also exist.

Back on Motet, I would assume that there are a number of spaceports
scattered throughout the countryside.  This allows offworlders to pick
up their cargoes at the point of origin, and compensates for the lack of
bulk ground transportation on Motet.  The world is probably producing as
much as it can without wholesale mechanization of the farming industry
(which would include internal combustion tractors, fertilizers,
pesticides, and general increase to about TL6).  I doubt that Motet
feeds the entire subsector (except for spices, exotic foods, wines, or
other luxury items; these are probably carried to markets many parsecs
away).  However, Motet probably makes the difference between starvation
and plenty for Madrigal, and perhaps other nearby worlds.

Again, let\'s put this in perspective.  In the "real world" today, none
of the major producers of machine tools and precision equipment are
still at TL6 (most, including the USA and Japan, are hovering somewhere
around TL8).  So nobody imports TL6 equipment anymore; it can\'t be had.
The US is (still) a major producer and exporter of machine tools and
precision equipment; we do import some, mostly TL8 equipment from Japan.
On the other hand, a *LOT* of existing factories and equipment date back
to the TL6 period.  Although we do not import this equipment anymore, a
great deal of the everyday industrial production that goes on in the US
is still being done with TL6 equipment.

Madrigal is the only world in the subsector which is classed as
"Industrial".  I take this to mean that it is the only one capable of
creating on a mass produced basis the products of post industrial
revolution society.  Although low, TL6 roughly corresponds to post-WWII
America (say 1946-1959 as a really rough range).  I see Madrigal
mass-producing items, frequently to off-world (and high tech) designs
and requirements.  Example: "Hey, Charlie!  Why would anybody need to
draw Lanthanum wire?  I dunno, Joe, but we just got an order for a
thousand spools of it!".

As far as the required precision goes, I think that Madrigal will be
able to make equipment that fills most (but not all) requirements.
Again, working to off-world plans will enable them to contribute to
products which are then finished on another world to a higher tech
level.  As an example, Madrigal may produce machined steel castings for
lathe parts (the bed, ways, etc).  These are then shipped to another
world, which then completes the lathe, equipping it with laser
interferometer sensors, and a sophisticated computer control system.
The result is a high-tech numerically-controlled lathe.

As far as the 100 million tons figure, it was made up; and I was
thinking exports, not total production (and I should have said so, but
didn\'t: mea culpa).  If this doesn\'t sound like a good figure for a TL6
industrial world, can you suggest a figure?

No flames from me!  As a matter of fact, I agree with you!
I do see a problem with Traveller, though.  The
starport classifications are developed first, and independently of both
the characteristics of the world and of the characteristics of the rest
of the subsector.  What we are trying to do is construct
rationalizations for a system which is fundamentally random.

Even when (because they have a lower labor costs, and a very favorable
exchange rate) they can underbid local subcontractors by 5000 Cr/Ton,
and have a signed contract with Arekut with a gauranteed frequency of
service?  All other things being equal, and according to exchange rate
table (initially presented in the Journal, and later in Striker), a
TL-10, Starport-B world can underbid a local contractor on a TL-14,
Starport-A world by *HALF*.  In the case of a Book 2 Model/4 computer,
this means that the computer is about 4 tons (shipping space 5 tons?).
The thing has a list price of 30 million credits (standard, I presume).
Going to a TL-10, Starport-B supplier saves 15,000,000 credits, enough
to ship the thing 3,000 parsecs and still break even.

To quote chapter and verse (Traveller Book 3: Worlds and Adventures,
copyright 1977 by Game Designers\' Workshop, page 5):
A = Excellent Quality Installation.  Refined Fuel Available.  Annual
    maintainance overhaul available.  Shipyard capable of starship and
    non-starship construction present.  May contain Naval Base and/or
    Scout base.
B = Good Quality installation.  Refined fuel available.  Annual
    maintainance overhaul available.  Shipyard capable of constructing
    non-starships present.  May contain Naval and/or Scout bases.
C = Routine installation.  Only unrefined fuel available.  Reasonable
    repair facilities present.  May contain a Scout base.
D = Poor quality installation.  Only unrefined fuel available.  No
    repair or shipyard facilities present.  May contain a Scout base.
E = Frontier installation.  Essentially a bare spot of bedrock with
    no fuel, facilities, or bases present.
X = No starport.  No provision made for any starship landings.

Note that nothing explicit is said about traffic levels (even relative
traffic levels).  Going back to the airport metaphor, which is imperfect
at best, does O\'Hare have the capability to build an aircraft or
assemble one from components?  I don\'t know what a 100hr inspection
entails, and I don\'t know of any airline has a major maintainance
facility there.  If major maintainance is available, I would classify it
as Class B; otherwise it\'s got to be C.

In my (humble) opinion, starport classification has nothing to do with
size or amount of traffic.  If a municipal airport rents out one of the
hangars to a lightplane maintainance and restoration company, and if the
airport has both AvGas and Jet-A available, then it is class B (overhaul
available, both kinds of fuel).  Other airports of similar size might be
Class D, if they only sell AvGas and no repairs are available.  Class E
might be an "airstrip" out in the outback of Australia - a patch of bare
ground that\'s been cleared of most large obstructions.  Class X is a
farmer\'s field: you are not supposed to land there, but you might be
able to in an emergency.

More than anything else, I think we are hitting our heads on a major
limitation in Traveller: not enough detail in the definitions (and too
few categories to pigeonhole things into).  Probably there sould be some
detailed starport generation scheme, which detailed the types of
services available, and the capacity of each one.

I think we have the classic chicken and egg problem here.  For some
worlds, blessed with abundant raw materials, adequate (but not
excessive) population, and sufficient technology and industry, will be
able to independently achieve starfaring status (I would guess that most
TL-10+, Industrial, Class-A starport worlds meet this criteria).

Then there are the exceptions.  Worlds at which shipping concentrated
for other reasons, including accidents of astrography or strategic
location, may eventually attract Class-A or Class-B facilities, even if
much of the technology and skill has to be imported.

Although you may have a point, I will argue that there\'s no real
penalty in having a steel hull for most commercial applications.
In almost all cases, agility is going to be zero anyway, so that
the mass of the hull is irrellevant; volume of hull material does not
enter into the design sequence anyway, and the price modifier for steel
is the same as superdense or bonded superdense - the cheapest available.
With TL-6 materials, most starship hulls rather resemble that of a
battleship - more than a foot of armor steel!  So what?

On the other hand, being cheap and low tech, it has relatively few
control points (about half the control point requirement of any other
type of hull material).  This would tend to save on computer and crew
requirements.

A TL-6 world could probably fabricate Composite Laminates and
Lightweight Composite Laminates if the knowledge and need were
available.  Some of the raw materials (in particular, carbon "whiskers"
grown in microgravity conditions) may be imported.

Rule Number One: All of the inherently-profitable routes have attracted
large (relative to a group of player characters in a free trader)
outfits who run these routes regularly (and have most of the large and
legitimate cargoes spoken for).

The usual advice to referees applies, in short:
Feed the players a steady diet of table scraps; just enough to
keep them feeling that they *COULD* get a big break.  They sould win
most fights, loose some, make some enemies, win some friends.
The players should feel that they control their destiny, and that they
can and do make some sort of difference.

Ignore what the rules say, and wing it.  Go for what makes the plot
develop in whatever way you need it to.  However, don\'t bludgeon the
players; they *NEED* to feel that thay have some sort of choice, even if
its between bad and worse (but try to keep things upbeat unless you know
your players prefer otherwise: compare the relative popularity and
lonvevity of Cyberpunk vs Star Trek (an estimated 50% of the US
males over 18 consider themselves Star Trek "fans")).

However, exporters would have facilities availble in starships which
were simply not available in the historical TL-3 period.  Exports may
well include fresh meat and vegetables, suitably frozen, refrigerated or
otherwise preserved while aboard the starship.

I tend to agree with Rob.

However, this does depend somewhat on the
"trade model" one uses.  If you assume large amounts of interstellar
trade, this is a reasonable description.  If, on the other hand, you assume
that the volume of trade is small and concentrated primarily in luxuries
and exotic goods, then it is unreasonable to assume that imported
technology is significant.

I\'ve never really considered an Imperial Army before (for some reason,
the Navy, Marines, and Scouts all seem more interesting).  I suppose
that the Imperium would have one, but I don\'t really have a good feel
for how they would work in a game setting.

Yes!  I like this!  Let\'s do it!  TL-13 would place us anywhere from
about 300 to 700 ... any preferences?

Metlay: prepare to be boggled!

In many of my campaigns, the concept of a "trip voucher" arose.
Originally arranged through the Travellers\' Aid Society (and only
available to members), in later campaigns we extended the concept and
made it available as a commercial service, through a company which
provided many travel-related services (rather like a travel agency
combined with the American Express company).  I have recently started
calling these vouchers "Travellers\' Destination Recipts".

The TAS service was provided as a service to TAS members; improving
service and connections.  Some of the larger transportation
megacorporations (like Tukera) could provide a similar service, but only
within the company.  The first commercial ventures were started by a
consortium of smaller local lines, as a way to compete with the larger
line\'s scheduled service.

The basic concept is that a sophisticated database system is fed with
all of the schedule data for every scheduled interstellar passenger
service in the area.   All different kinds of lines provide
scheduled service (for various reasons, including contractual
obligations for the Imperium, subsidy, or for mail).  In particular,
mail and subsidy contracts typically require the maintainance of an
established schedule with a mandatory on-time percentage.

In such a scheme, departure dates and times are fixed, with the
corresponding arrival time variable due to the nature of jumpspace
travel.  Even so, there is a maximum jump length (unless a misjump
occurrs).  Connections are scheduled so there is at least 12 hours
between worst-case arrival time and the scheduled departure of the
connection.  This amount of time means that travellers occasionally have
to hustle to make their connection (particularly in cases of delays at
customs, or in the inbound traffic pattern).  The more usual case is for
the players to have a day or two to signt-see between connections; just
right for a short encounter or other interesting activity.

The database is searched to find the "best" path from world of origin to
the destination.  In the case of vouchers issued by TAS, the trip is
routed through worlds with TAS installations if possible.  The trip
price is based on the price of the individual High Passages which would
make up the journey.  There is typically a 10% surcharge for the voucher
(although TAS does not charge this fee); in return, the company issuing
the voucher has a contract with the passenger lines.  The contract
requires that a certain number (based on expected ridership) of berths
be reserved for voucher holders.  The reserved berths must be held in
reserve until 12 hours after the arrival of any connecting ship.

In the cases of missed connections, unfilled reserved staterooms, and
other emergencies, the local agent tries to do the best he or she can.
Usually missed connections will be made good on the next available
transport.  Unfilled reserved berths are paid for at a rate specified in
the appropriate contract, unless the ship\'s captain has managed to fill
them with middle passengers.  The shipping companies are paid regularly
for the trips actually taken, again at times and rates specified on the
contracts.

Such a system provides everyone with benefits.  Passengers have less
worry about connecting flights, and have the benefit of scheduled
arrival and departure times.  The transport companies get more business
and can better compete aganst the large lines.  And the company providing
the service makes a provit from the surcharge.

Or shipping for bulk goods should cost about 1/10th of what it currently
does.  Something that would be nice is to have some sort of low-cost
bulk shipping method, so that things like ores and other high-bulk,
low-value commodities could be shipped profitably.

But I agree with you, the trade and commerce system is in desparate need
of fixing.

Well in the spirit of who-gives-a-damn-about-TNE I have gone back to
working on my current campaign universe. Specifically I have decided to
give it more of a "history" and connection with the pre-Imperium
history.

Anyway one of the major areas of work are the Sword Worlds. There are a
lot of very strange things about them. So I need to get as much info as
I can about what/who they are and their motivations for their settling
where they did. This info being in the context of "official" pre-history.
I\'m also interested in how other GMs have interpreted the Sword World
past. Past meaning pre -200 info.

Here is what I have of their past (pre-Imperial ):

PI
- -420 Sword Worlds (colonists of Scandanavian origin) leave Terra
- -399 Sword Worlds settle Gram.

Why did they leave Terra to settle so far away? If they wanted to settle
in uncolonised space then the rimward frontier is far closer.

The Syleans contacted Vland about -495 and Vland was back in space by
- -450. So were the Terrans and obviously the Syleans were major players.
How did the Sword Worlders get by them?

Why in a time of resurging space activity did they want to go into the
middle of nowhere to start a Confederation?

How many settlers left Terra?

Why did it take them 21 years? At jump 2 it takes about 6 years to get from
Sol to the Marches. The Itzin who landed on Darrian in -1520 took only
about 7 years. The Itzin were travelling as the Long Night was starting
and had about 30,000 settlers. A possible reason for the delay is that
about -420 the Long Night was ending however the vast majority of the
worlds of the 1st Imperium were still in decline and had no ability to
support starports and such facilities......

These Sword worlders seem in no way related to Piper\'s view of the Sword
Worlds other than in name. They certainly have had no major military succeses
to speak of.

 Now, on to something more important: STUTTERWARP.

 So far, opinion is running about four-to-one against incorporating
 it into the Traveller universe, and about 100% against incorporating
 it as a retrofit (i.e. "it was always there, you just didn\'t notice it.")
 These are two separate issues, and let me talk a little bit about both
 of them.

 The two issues are 1) whether we should add stutterwarp to the Traveller
 universe, and 2) IF SO, how to do so with the least damage to continuity.
 Is it easiest to believe that this new drive system was recently
 introduced to the neighborhood, or is it easier to rewrite history (as
 DC Comics did, I guess, a while back with their Infinite Earths series)?

 Issue 2 impacts only established players, as new players won\'t know the
 difference. Therefore, when existing players say unanimously that it
 should not be a rewrite of history, that carries the argument.
 Stutterwarp, *if* introduced to the Traveller universe in TNE,
 will be a technological innovation which post-dates the assassination
 of Strephon.

 Now, issue number 1. Why introduce stutterwarp at all?

 It seems to me that stutterwarp does a better job than does a simple
 delta-vee model of replicating squadron and fleet battles as they have always
 been described in Traveller literature. Even High Guard and Trillion Credit
 Squadron\'s abstract maneuver systems produced combat exchanges which
 never struck me as the sort of things which would result from a
 delta-vee system. This is because Traveller\'s inspiration for
 ship-to-ship combat has always been a surface naval model, with lines
 of battle trading broadsides and so forth. This is, not coincidentally,
 the classic science fiction model as well. A delta-vee maneuver system,
 however, produces combat situations which bear no resemblance to
 that surface naval analogy at all, and which are much closer to
 those found in aerial dogfights.

 If I were doing this from scratch, I would have commercial ships
 rely on delta-vee for maneuver, thus leaving you with a fun
 ship-to-ship delta-vee combat system for the small stuff.
 Stutterwarp (probably because of expense, and the fact that it\'s not
 as efficient a way to get from star to star) would be used almost
 exclusively by purpose-built warships. From a game point of view,
 this makes larger actions (say half a dozen to a dozen ships per
 side) very playable, while that is much less true with a
 delta-vee system. From a game world point of view, it means that
 REAL warships run rings around civilian ships when it comes to
 in-system combat, a very nice distinction I think, and fleet actions
 play out the way we have always described them in the Traveller
 literature.

 So what do you think? Nothing has been finalized yet about
 stutterwarp in the final version.

I read with interest, Bart Massey\'s goodbye message, and while I don\'t
feel the same way about GDW, I must admit my continuing confusion aboutthe
various \'versions\' of TRAV.

I\'ve been hanging around the TML for about a year or so now, and I too
enjoy the interesting discussions, albeit manyof them go straight over my
head!

I have been trying to collect as many of the Original TRAV booklets and
seem tohave done fairly well, but MEGA TRAV I find boggling.

And despite it all, I still can\'t get a grip on how to start a Trav game.
Participation in the PBeM has been the most gratifying experience, but
it\'s more like taking part in a play, than actually playing TRAV.  I\'ve no
complaints...

However, after all is said and done, I\'m still confused about Traveller,
MegaTraveller, Traveller 2000 (or is it 2300) etc. etc.

If ANYONE has even a basic understanding of the what lies behind the
decisions to constantly revise (read: overhaul) the system from revision
to revision, could you enlighten me?

I suppose this really won\'t help me PLAY Trav, but might at least helpme
decide whether to dispense with Classic Trav, in favour of MegaTrav or
whatever!

Also, has anyone compiled a glossary of acronyms?  I still get confused
when I see things like COACC and others.  What the hell IS COACC?

I\'ve been thinking on Scott\'s question of how my background in
geology affects my traveller playing.  I guess my response is
damn little.  Rocks and their geochemistry just doesn\'t have
much impact on the various mis-adventures of my characters.  Igneous
petrology, and the exchange of isotopes in hydrothermal systems
just doesn\'t help much when the TJ freighter is being chased by
a bunch of vargr corsairs, \'ya know.

I do however, know a great deal about submarines, having a father
who spent over half his life building them, and having worked for
two defense contracters myself who made submarine "toys" when I
couldn\'t find an honest geology job in the 80\'s.

Which brings me to something I\'ve been thinking about lately:
the construction of ship hulls.  The way I see it, the problems
with builing a hull for a submaine and a hull for a traveller
space craft can\'t be too different.  The man who designed the
Nautilus and the Skipjack once described the problem to me thus: if
all you had to do was put a sphere or a cylinder capped by hemispheres
in the water, then there would be no problems in making a hull that
could withstand the deepest oceanic pressures.  The problem, he said,
was that you had to make holes in the hull, for the drive shaft, for
the hatches, for the cooling water intakes.  It\'s the holes that are
the "weakness" in withstanding the great pressure gradients.

In addition, there is the technological problem in making a one-piece
hull.  Early submarines were rivetted together!  (remember the great
scene in Das Boot where they had to dive to bottem near Gilbratar, and
the rivets starting popping in the hull?)  One of the tremendous advances
in sub design that came out of Electric Boat in the 50\'s was the ability
to weld the thick hull plates together.  It\'s the welds and the perforation
of the hull that are the zones of weakness, not the material of the hull.
If you make a one-piece hull out of a thick enough material (read metal),
then you can withstand greater pressure gradients (no, I haven\'t forgotten
that the cylinder has a limitation on diameter - I\'m blissfully ignoring
it for now.)

So what does this have to do with traveller, you ask?  Well, first, we\'ve
been assuming that any decent space ship is able to withstand great
pressure gradients, e.g. the Flamboyant hidng in the ocean of Welles
in Scott\'s 4.5th Frontier War, and also any ol\' ship doing refueling in
a gas giant.  That means that those ship hulls must be as good or better
as a modern submarine in the U.S. Navy.  (I can hear one or two of you
kvetch that the 688 class has an official depth rating of around 250
meters.  Well, that\'s true <I hope I remembered that number correctly>.
But remember, the 688 class has a less than optimal thickness to
diameter ratio.  The skipjack class, made out of inferior steel (HY80
vs. HY120) can dive deeper because the designers at EB purposefully
optimized the diameter to hull thickness ratio.  The titanium hulls
on the newer soviet subs can dive deepest, but the welding technolgy
is what allows the use of titanium for a hull, and it\'s a bear!)

This leads me to thinking that "super-dense" materials are not the
correct path to travel down in pursuit of the 57th century space hull.
I opine that it\'s advances in making one-piece hulls of suitable
thickness that\'s the trick.  If you could weld a hull of titanium or
steel, or better yet, if you grow a single crystal of metal into a formed
hull, then that\'s what required.  The hull perforation problem can be
taken care of by arm-waving good enough iris hatches.  But making the
hull itself is the real problem.  It\'s not super-dense materials we
need - it\'s good enough technology to weld a one piece hull.  The
materials we already have are sufficient, so long as we can weld them
together adequately in the thickness required.  The welds are the
weakness (or has everyone forgotten the great weld defect scandal at
Electric Boat in 1979, that lead to the cost-overrun fiasco which made
national news <my apologies to the non-US readers of this list>?)

What does super dense really get us anyway?  Perhaps better armour
for naval and scout ships.  But why invent a new material when what
we have is sufficient (in my opinion)?  Not only that, but consider
that those super-dense material are going to be a bitch to weld - and
that\'s the big problem in my mind anyway!

How do make super-dense, by the way?  Do we convince two nuleii to
occupy one set of electron orbitals by somehow negating the tremdous
force of two positive charges trying to escape on another?  Do we
make an elastic material out of very dense atoms?  Only certain metallic
elements have the property of being elastic, strong in both compression
and tension, weldable, and (most-importantly) non-cleavable.  Unless
we "discover" an unknown principal of quantum chemistry, I think we
stuck with good ol\' steel and titanium.  <I\'ve been teaching
crystallography and mineralogy to a bunch of undergrads, so I confess
I\'ve had a lot of inorganic chemistry on the brain lately...I\'ve been
dreaming of Pauling\'s Five Rules in my sleep, for crying out loud. Gads!>

I think I\'ve rambled on long enough (my apolgies for the length of this
post - I really didn\'t it to turn out this long, really!).  So what does
anyone else think?

You are confused as to the causes of the feel of a "classic Naval
battle".  It has very little to do with the drive type, and a lot more
to do with relative speed and range.  In Traveller as it stands, weapons
ranges are long enough that it takes several hours to travel to the
limit of weapon ranges.  With stutterwarp ships and the same weapons, it
takes about 5 seconds to travel to the limit of weapon range.
In a WW2 Naval battle (there were only a handful that match the
model you are looking for, BTW), weapon range is 20-odd nautical miles,
about an hour\'s travel.  In an aerial dogfight, weapon ranges were less
than a thousand yards unless you were extremely lucky, less than three
seconds travel.
Actually, having played Starcruiser, Mayday, and TCS games (the last
both with standard "line of battle" and with a more detailed Mayday
style movement (this is how I am doing my TCS game now, BTW)), I find
that only the classic TCS has anything like the feel of a Naval battle.
Starcruiser and Mayday have none of that "line of battle" feel to them,
and the battles in my TCS game stopped looking like classic TCS as soon
as one of the players decided to develop a Doctrine that ignored the
"line of battle" as meaningless in space.
Then, of course, there is that pesky third dimension.  Unless you
decide that space is flat, it\'ll always be there to mess up your
picture.
I also question that the "naval battle" is the classic Science
Fiction model.  In almost all of the science fiction I have read with
large fleet actions, from Lensmen series (by E.E. Smith) to Saberhagen\'s
Berserkers, the feel has been more toward an aerial action than a
surface navy action.  Indeed, in First Lensman the battles were fought
like naval engagements, but by Galactic Patrol (the next book) that
Doctrine had been dropped as unworkable unless the enemy cooperated,
which he seldom did.

If you did that, pirates would have to be purpose built warships.
Remember that the 100-diameter limit is only two minutes travel away
from low orbit for a stutterwarp ship, so the Navy will ALWAYS be able
to come to the rescue of someone in need of it.
As to the stutterwarp being less efficient than Jump, I cannot
understand why ANYONE thinks that.  Dragging out my old Starcruiser
game, I see that a 75MW "New Commercial" stutterwarp fits neatly into
the slot left by a Free Trader\'s Maneuver Drive.  It requires 27% of the
power of the old maneuver drive (which means you can scrap the power
plant and put a cheaper one in, thus saving on fuel, and increasing
cargo space).  According to the Imperial Encyclopedia, a Free Trader
masses 2280 Tons loaded.  Dcrease that by 140T for the M-drive removed,
add in 62T for the stutterwarp, and get a final mass of 2202T.  Going
back to Starcruiser, I find that 75MW - 2202T gives a pseudo-speed of
5.2 light years per day (faster than a KENNEDY!!!), which translates to
a sustained travel speed (assuming good geometry on a long trip) of
jump-5+.  Even ignorng that a free trader can only go a parsec in one
week, and the stutterwarp version can cover that same parsec (which is
well within 7.7 lightyears) in 15 hours.
Admittedly, the stutterwarp cost more than the M-drive that fits
into the same space.  But coming at the problem the other way, let\'s see
how expensive a stutterwarp you need to install to get the same 1 parsec
per week performance out of a stutterwarp ship.  Again we assume a 2200T
Free Trader.  Using "OLD Commercial", we find that we need a 0.055MW
stutterwarp to get that performance.  0.06MW costs 1.2MLv, compared to
2.8MCr for the maneuver drive, plus 12MCr for the jump-drive it also
replaces, plus 3.1MCr for the power plant you no longer need.  And don\'t
forget that you get more cargo in this version, so you make more money
per trip.  And that you have lowered the mass somewhat, so this version
would also be somewhat faster....

DON\'T do this!  It is unnecessary for the effect you want to produce.
It will kill piracy AGAIN!  It will change the whole picture of
Traveller (which does not, in and of itself, bother me).  And, perhaps
most important, the first world to develop this will conquer EVERYONE
ELSE VERY QUICKLY!  So your New Era will be a New Empire about five
years after stutterwarp is discovered.  Unless you stretch plausibility
well past the breaking point by specifying that every spacefaring world
discovers it independently within the period of a few weeks.

Where did you find the date for leaving Terra?

I have some ideas about this, but first I\'d like to know if the bit about
coming from Terra itself is official. I\'ve always assumed that they came
from a scandinavian-settled world, not Terra.

Possibly the Syleans and Vilani didn\'t want them around (or the Sword-
worlders didn\'t like the conditions for settling down, ie. subordinate
themselves to another government). Still, both Syleans and Vilani were
\'Rule of Law\' adherents, so they didn\'t want to attack a peaceful
colony fleet. Instead they welcomed the Swordworlders, gave their ships
a free refit, and then escorted them to the other side of their sphere
of influence with instructions to keep moving.

Piper\'s original explanation makes as much sense as anything: They were
the loosers of a war and fled to somewhere far away from their successful
enemies.

I give up. How many settlers left Terra?

Maybe they spent some time negotiating with first the Sylean Confederation,
later Vland, about permission to settle somewhere. They finally decided
that if they wanted to do things their way without interference they would
have to go somewhere far away from established areas.

                                -oOo-

For some time I\'ve been working on a chronology for the Spinward Marches.
I hadn\'t planned to post it until I had typed it all in, but Ameer\'s
questions about the Sword Worlds have made me change my mind. At the
rate that I finish my projects it could take years before I finish this
one, so what the hell, here\'s the first half.

What follows is a collection of dates culled from all the Traveller and
MegaTraveller sources that I have access to at the moment.

Entries in brackets are made up by me out of whole cloth. If only the
date is in bracket then the entry has been mentioned somewhere (or can
reasonably be inferred from other information) without a date, and I\'ve
made up something I found reasonable.
When several contradictory dates for the same event exists I\'ve selected
the one that makes the most sense or the most recently published one if
they are equally likely. I\'ve been tempted to revise several really odd
dates, but have settled for footnotes.
When an event is dated as \'by now\' it means that the event took place
before that date, but that this is the earliest mention of the event
that I\'ve found.
Note that I\'ve included everything I could find, from the most trivial
to the most momentuous. There\'s only one major exception: There are
lots and lots of information about the conduct of the Fifth Frontier
War, from TAS messages in the Journal to capsule resumes of character
backgrounds in \'Tarsus\' and \'Beltstrike\'. I think that including them
all will add 50% to this listing. If any of you want to make a
seperate listing, go ahead.

If you have any snippets of information that I\'ve missed, please let
me know with reference. If you\'ve got different dates for some event
chances are that I know the reference already, but by all means let
me know.

Notes:

[1]: I\'ve  personally decided that these are found on Andor.  This is com-
     pletely unofficial.
[2]: Even if Sword World starships didn\'t find any of the Darrian colonies
     between  -399 and -275,  two starfaring cultures within 12 parsecs of
     each other must surely interact sooner than after 111 years. Contacts
     could have been restricted to unofficial meetings, though.
[3]: The  date for first contact between the Imperium and the Sword Worlds
     are variously given as 53, 73, and 147 in different places.  The date
     for  first  contact  with the Darrians is given as 148.  I\'ve decided
     that a) The Scouts would find a subsector-wide interstellar community
     during the first sweep, and b) that they would find the Darrians very
     shortly after finding the Sword Worlds.

Just a short note today--due to a potential crackdown on "inappropriate"
computer use at work, I will be transferring all of my Traveller activities
for the forseeable future to my back-up account at:

robdean@access.digex.com

So, those of you who might have reason to send me personal email, or have me
in an alias file, are requested to make note of this.  There are two problems
with this change.  The first is that I am limited in my access hours, which
means I\'ll be slower than usual in responding to anything.  The second is
that the mail handler at this site is not as sophisticated as the one I\'m used
to, and it\'ll be some time before I can work through its details.  So, please
bear with me.

On other fronts, I\'m back from ym latest round of business travel, and should
be able to start re-editing the Gamba world descriptions soon.  So, start
thinking about those adventures.  Hans--what do you think Adriano was like
before the disaster?

On starports:  I like the idea of a detailed starport generator.  Any ideas
as to what ought to go into it?  SHipyard size? Number of landing/docking
bays? Number of retail stores on the concourse?

Please pass this on to Frank Chadwick:

Dear Mr. Chadwick:

I agree wholeheartedly with GDW\'s refusal to rewrite history and
include stutterwarp as a previously existing technology; thanks
for giving the nod to us old fogies. I can also see why SW is a
tempting thing to have for combat purposes-- it\'ll simplify the
rules a lot and eliminate several types of weapons and screens
that are no longer useful. (I am an unrepentant delta-vee combat
fanatic, but hell, I can always play ALBEDO when I need a fix.)

The one thing I wish to caution you folx against is the artificial
limitation of stutterwarp to a particular type of craft or purpose.
If stutterwarp is demonstrably better than standard M-drives for
survivability, speed, and (in emergencies) travel to nearby systems
after a misjump dumps you two parsecs from the nearest star, any
starship owner with an IQ capable of allowing him to feed himself
is going to make the switch. The reasons behind keeping these people
from having such a device had better be damn plausible and damn
convincing. Allow me to suggest a few, in the light of the TNE milieu:

1. Sheer cost. Not everyone can afford a meson cannon on his ship;
the easiest and most practical way to limit the spread of SW drives
is to make them ridiculously expensive to build.

2. Drive size. If a SW plant masses 600 tons, you can bet no one is
going to retrofit it into a cargo vessel that still hopes to make a profit.

3. Late design date + collapse of interstellar communication. If
the SW drive was invented by someone in one part of the galaxy,
it would take years or decades for the secret to spread. There\'s
actually a good historical precedent for this, that would make the
whole introduction of the new technology very clean and exciting in
the new milieu, but I can\'t discuss it here because it involves data
from the recent GDW writers\' conference that I can\'t disclose. I\'d
appreciate it if you could contact me about including this in TNE....

There is also the question of whether you really want to risk the
potential confusion inherent in a dual space combat system. If SW
makes for a clean, easy to use system, why ask for trouble by tacking
on another, more complicated set of rules for delta-vee combat,
especially one that groups of novice players with their smaller ships
will be forced to use? Unless said delta-vee system were TRULY simple
and fun, you would be tacitly suggesting to groups of players that
they can only have fun if they\'re on a big warship. I\'m not flat out
against the idea, I just urge caution and a great deal of playtesting
of any proposed dual setup.

Thanks.

Postscript to Wildstar:

I wasn\'t boggled at all. Your system makes sense, in a core area where
starship travel is unlikely to be disrupted in any major way. I still
can\'t see it being that effective in the Marches, or another frontier
area where schedules are so iffy....

Nice try, but it doesn\'t feel right to me.

view of game design, they\'re more than outweighed by it\'s impact on the
Imperium-based game. If I understand aright:

The intention is to throw together Traveller and the other GDW games so that
GDW ends up with one generic system a la GURPS with Traveller TNE as a
combination of GURPS Space and that supplement\'s default background (um, I
don\'t own GURPS Space by the way, so if I\'m describing it wrong forgive me).
2300 may be another supplement, there may also be other licenses, right?

Stutterwarp belongs in the 2300 supplement. If it\'s that nice it will be a
good selling point for 2300. Problem is that most sf backgrounds will have
their own hands-in-the-air explanation for space travel, and (like
Traveller) this ends up being a very significant part of the atmosphere of
the game/book/film/show/opera/whatever. So you\'re going to
have to do without stutterwarp at some stage (what happens if GDW get a Star
Trek license, or a Star Wars license, or ....). Traveller/Imperium uses Jump
and maneouvre, it\'s the flavour of the game.

(come to think of it, what do they do if they get a "The Mote in God\'s Eye"
license?).

Hmmm...  I wonder if I will surprise a few here by saying that I
don\'t like using psionics in my campaigns...  As systems meant to
deal with psionics I guess I prefer Traveller over other systems,
but mainly because the psionic system is very limited.  As long as
you remember that psionics in Traveller is pretty limited by
comparison to say... Star Wars or magic stuff in D&D.

The MOST IMPORTANT Advice in the psi system is NOT to let your
players talk you into some super powered psionic ability just
because they rolled something under the \'Special\' category.  I will
usually let a player hand pick a psi skill when they roll the
\'Special\'.  I once saw a player who chose to transmute elements as
his special ability.  1 Kg of material per psi point expended.  He
then chose to create kilogram sized chunks of Anti-matter.  Thank
GOD I was not the ref.

Of course I came up with some of my own custom rules for psi stuff.
For instance:  If a character possesses telepathy, awareness,
medical skill and has a psi strength greater than 8, that character
may induce psionic regeneration in another person.  It\'s tough;
it\'s a strain, but it can be done.
(For the curious, Jietlshaiepr can do it, albeit barely)

Another custom rule is that psionic strength may be regained more
easily (or even be temporarily boosted) by relaxation techniques.
Activity is easier when the mind when is relaxed.  This is
precipitated by the presence and actions of a \'significant other\'

But just imagine the excitement of those 5 years as all the other powers
desparately attempt to steal the Secret of Stutterwarp before they\'re
overrun!

Then all the obsolete jumpdrive warships can be decommissioned to serve
as slow freighters and sold for scrap; the PCs can get their hands on one
without mortgaging their grandchildren; pirates can rip off a few
warps and beat the military expansion out to the slow zones where they
can prey at will on the slowboat navies, until the New Empire catches
up to them.

Note that if you have a Stutterwarp the 100-diameter limit is
meaningless for piracy.  You don\'t just appear there, you \'warp in,
right?  I don\'t know if course-matching under stutterwarp is plausible,
I suspect the proper way to do piracy is to have a few guys on the
merchant to take control or disable the \'warp well outside the system,
then offload the best cargo to your pirate ship.  By the time the Navy
answers the speed-of-light distress call, you\'re long gone.

Besides until things settle down, Stutterwarp Naval ships will have much
more important things to do than anti-pirate patrols.  Once the New
Empire is firmly in place, THEN piracy will be risky, but at that point
you can always release a computer virus or something. :-)

Besides, how many Traveller games last longer than 5 years gametime anyway?

How to allow GDW to write a generic rule book for TRAVELLER which
describes the mechanics of the universe without contradicting the
existing mechanics.

The big problem with STUTTERWARP is that it makes in-system TRAVELLER
drives appear useless and that it is vastly superior in getting from
point A to point B.

JUMP drive operates in parsecs.  How about revising the scale of the
universe such that each hex (old parsec) equals 10 parsecs now.  Your
TRAVELLER map stays the same ie JUMP-1 equals 1 hex per week.  In fact,
I remember reading a lot of complaints about the scarcity of stellar
objects and this should allow the game scale to expand and more
locations to exist.  This also allows for much more exploration and
the GMs to redefine large tracts of space without changing the basic
IMPERIUM layout.

The above doesn\'t sound like too difficult a change.  Any problems
that you can see with this?

Secondly, in-system travel is currently via thruster plates but what\'s
to stop you from placing a gravity-well limitation on STUTTERWARP such
once they get within their discharge radius the STUTTERWARP doesn\'t
work anymore.  True, you still can zip all over the system but you
need something to get you in and out of those gravity wells.

I\'m playing in a 2300 (ie STUTTERWARP) fleet campaign now and the
mechanics of combat are quite simple and fun.  I\'m sure that if you
introduced a ship design system that incorporated all three drive
systems (JUMP, STUTTERWARP, THRUSTER-PLATES) then you\'ve got more
variety to play with.

If you\'re interested in pure TRAVELLER then you make STUTTERWARP
next to useless or ignore it all together in the IMPERIUM expansion
book while removing JUMP and THRUSTER-PLATES from the 2300 expansion
module.

It should be just a matter of adjusting the characteristics and costs
to get the right feel.

Want to add in WARP Drive and Gates?  Again, it should be just a matter
of identifying the mechanics in the TRAVELLER generic rules and then
enhancing/disabling them in the particular expansion module for the
universe that you\'re playing in.

GDW are trying to get fresh-blood into the game.  You can\'t stop
them because its their business.  I can relate to a lot of the complaints
about rewriting history and changing the mechanics of the universe
but how about putting that energy, that VERY creative energy into
some ideas and instructions for GDW to use to keep TRAVELLER (and GDW)
growing.

I will now get off my soap-box and ... (huh, who\'s that? A gun! duck no
run for it blat blat blat) {transmission ends}.

The first and major consideration is "wholeness" (for lack of better term).
Is the Starport located wholy on the plant\'s surface or does it have an
orbital component and, if so, of what size.

The orbital component will, of course, be the docking/unloading station for
planetoid and dispersed configuration ships, as well as for ships without
M-drives and very, very big ships (Atlantis class comes to mind).

The primary division of the land-side Starport shall be for ships landing on
gravitic M-drive versus ships on rocket M-drive (not many of those, true),
and shall possibly include a runway (for the streamlined ships) and a landing
field with blast resistant tarmac for the vertically landing rockets and
unstreamlined ships.

One of the important parameters to decide is the number of ship-berths and
their size ---- one 40,000 ton berth probably takes the space which may be
used by 150 Far Traders. The Starport, it seems, is a fairly large place (A
LOT larger than anything imagined in one of White Dwarves dealing with the
matter).

The next thing to decide is the size of the repair/maintenance area, provision
for simultaneous repair of ships, refueling stations and vehicles, fuel,
spares and equipment storage and parking space for \'port vehicles. Not to
mention designing these vehicles (cranes, mobile work platforms, tugs, loading
vehicles ---- Rob, this is going to fall in your lap, I am afraid).

Then come the customs houses and warehouses, incoming and outbound processing
areas for cargo and passengers, security vehicles and barracks, shops and
terminals and many other small fry.

In response to Hans Rancke on the Sword Worlds:

If you consider DGP official then the date for Terran departure is correct.
It states "-420: Sword World colonists leave Terra"
Now JTAS 18 states that the Sword Worlders are descended from "Solomani
exiles" whatever that means... I personally haven\'t decided on the
context of the the statement "leave Terra". It could apply specifically
to Terra or be a reference to the Terran Mercantile Union which was
now the Old Earth Union and had been in existence for almost 700 years.

But if they didn\'t like governments why go that way. Corewards is where
the Terrans knew that there were lots of governments. If you really want to
get away you head Rimwards.

Also to be kept in mind is the apparent Sylean desire not to reintegrate
Terra till later. Terra didn\'t join the Imperium till 588 well after the
First Survey (420). Vland was contacted and had join the Sylean Confederation
by -30.

One theory that fits some facts is that they sought political asylum but
were refused. Still doesn\'t explain why they did not drop anchor somewhere
in Deneb. Instead they marched into the Marches ....

>Piper\'s original explanation makes as much sense as anything: They were
>the loosers of a war and fled to somewhere far away from their successful

Hmmm....There is hardly any reference to Old Earth Union and its activities
between -1100 and 588. There *could* have been a civil war lead by a core
of worlds settled by a specific culture. There is also the "Gene War"
which strangely has no date attached to it. The reference to Confederation
implies that it
happened after the Solomani Confederation was formed but it could also be a
reference to the Terran Confederation. In that case the Sword Worlders could
be the survivors of the Gene War, the super men with super intelligence but
no genius. In that way they appear closer to the Saurons of the WarWorld
series by ....Drake?? Pournelle??
In either case that could give a reason for heading corewards. To gain
asylum.
The asylum could have been denied because in those early days neither the
Syleans nor the Vilani may have wanted or needed to deal with more
troublemakers. Additionally if they were super-beings they could have been
used as mercenary units for a period of time, which would explain the
length of time it took them to get to the Marches.
Eventually they had no asylum and decided to get far away from the Terrans
who would
know their source and would hunt them down. And since all human exploration
rimwards has been done by the Solomani that would also be a reason to head
towards the core.

>How many settlers left Terra?

I\'d suspect atleast 50,000. I know other people have done various population
growth models but by my rough guesstimate thats what you need to get to their
current population levels in 1500 years with remarkably little external
molestation or intervention.

The only catch is that neither the Syleans nor the Vilani controlled enough
space to be in such a position, unless the SW wanted to settle on pre-
developed worlds..... If so then why the sudden change of mind? If the SW
in -420 had the tech (10-11) to travel from Terra to Gram then they had more
then enough tech to take over the many worlds that had fallen behind. At this
time the Syleans controlled a few subsectors and their total influence was
restricted to that sector if that. The Vilani being the ever cautious probably
had even less.

    'body' => 'Reply to Frank Chadwick regarding Stutterwarp:

The issue put to us is as follows:  how best to incorporate Stutterwarp into
the Imperium universe, so as to unite the 2300AD and MegaTraveller gaming
systems.  I am no expert on 2300AD but is my understanding that Stutterwarp
is both fast and efficient, the only limitation being the need to disspate the
buildup of radiation.  This contrasts strongly with the more familiar jump
drive, where vast amounts of energy must be stored away into Zuchai crystals,
then released almost instantly into the Hull grid to transport one\'s vessel
into jump space, to reemerge one week later from one to six parsecs distant
from your starting point.

If the 2300AD sourcebook is to be set prior to the Imperium setting, as is
somewhat chronologically consistent, there are several difficulties to be
overcome:

1) the traditional Traveller/MT background has the Vilani encountering the
Terrans very shortly after the Terrans first discover jump drive.  The
implication is that Terra\'s closest stars were Vilani bases.  In the 2300AD
history, the earth nations explore and colonize for some range around Earth
before encoutering the Kafers.  A new chronology will be necessary.

2) Stutterwarp would appear to be better in almost every way than jump drive.
The fastest jump vessel has a \'velocity\' of only 20 light-years per week.
Furthermore, stutterwarp is not affected by gravity.  Yet, stutterwarp needs
to precede the development of jump drive.

3)  The Imperium and its surrounds are mapped out in an essentially 2D fashion,
yet 2300AD takes place in a 3D setting.

We need to find a way to constrict the volume of space occupied by the early
Terran colonies, and a way to make jump drive superior to Stutterwarp.

Another poster has already made the suggestion that I will make key here:  if
we keep as a general rule the idea that Jump-n allows one to travel n hexes
per week, we can choose a hex size to make Jump drive superior to Stutterwarp.
The 2D Imperium map becomes a loose approximation to the plane of our galaxy,
with each star in a hex actually displaced up or down some amount that we can
ignore for game purporses.  Furthermore, the large number of Terra-like planets
reflect the fact that there are a large number of less desirable systems that
don\'t appear on the hex grid.

The early Terran history has to be changed.  Terrans first discover Stutterwarp,
then begin to explore there nearby stars.  They encounter the Kafers, etcetera.
Give enough breakthing space here for a 2300AD sourcebook (at least one to two
hundred years).  About 2500AD, Terrans discover the Zuchai crystal which makes
possible the Jump-1 drive, which is much more powerful than the fastest
Stutterwarp drive.  The Terrans travel to the farthest star yet, and encounter
the Vilani!  In the face of the new \'Kafers\' Terra and its colonies unite,
beginning the first of the Interstellar Wars.  Many of the early Terran colonies
are abandoned as the Jump drive opens up more Earth-like planets. The rest of
known Traveller/MT history unfolds, leading up to the Rebellion.

Stutterwarp is rapidly relegated to a secondary drive, primarily used to travel
to the 100 diameter limit, as the only other systems worth visiting are so far
away that Stutterwarp isn\'t considered a realistic option.  The lowly Maneuver
drive is found only on surface to orbit shuttles and the like.

Starship combat becomes centered around the Stutterwarp drive, with M-drive
combat a rarity (most ships no longer carry such antiquated drives).  This
will substantially alter Starship combat, but perhaps that\'s for the better.

The real question is:  how large is the new hex to be?  I would suggest making
it large enough that even Jump-1 is 10 times \'faster\' for travel between any
two systems that are \'worth\' visiting.  Sure, there are plenty of systems not
on the map between Regina and Ruie, but those systems are pretty barren, and
not much to see.  This has the happy side-effect of leaving these \'un-hexed\'
systems open as a Referee\'s playground.  Want to put an Ancient site near
Lanth?  Put it in the unmapped region of stars near Lanth.

Catie Helm made some good comments about starship hulls, and
I\'d like to keep going along those lines.

One thing that should be noted first is that the analogy between
submarine hulls and starship hulls is not exact; at least in traveller,
they have different engineering goals, though similar.  A submarine has
the goal of resisting incredibly high pressures from the outside, and
all else (including hull shape, materials, design of hull penetrations,
etc) is organized around that engineering requirement.  Starships in
Traveller, on the other hand, have relatively puny hull stresses from
atmospheric pressure inside.  The space shuttle\'s cabin is made of
very thin aluminum sheet; resisting 15 psi is easy.  Re-entry imposes
higher stresses (much of it thermal), but in Traveller you can
easily pick your reentry speed, so those are minimized.  The closest
TML has come to determining why starship hulls in Traveller are
so heavy is that they have to block radiation, and the hull mass
that\'s described as "standard" hull, w/o additional armour, is just
about the right amount to limit lifetime exposures for starship
crews (accumulated flare radiation and Galactic Cosmic Radiation
exposures) to levels with minimal health effects.

Hull Armour for armour\'s sake is different; there, it\'s the
local thickness and toughness that matter.  The hardest part of armouring
starships is again, as in submarines, designing tough penetration points.
However, you have the advantage that the stresses you\'re working
against are potential and transient (impact, laser, etc) as opposed
to constant (submersible pressure).  It\'s reasonable, from a design
point of view, to trade off absolute armour protection in a small
area, if you\'ve got a reasonable probabalistic chance that it won\'t
be damaged.  You can\'t do that with sumbarine hulls 8-)

Enough about hull design issues.  Now, on to superdense...
I\'ve been thinking a lot about Superdense armour too, and here\'s what
I came up with.
Making hull plating thinner is not a good idea, for one reason:
thin plating is not stiff.  However, we\'ve got these nifty high-strength
dense matter materials.  How _do_ we use them to best effect in spacecraft?
Well, we use them the same way you use high-strength materials in
aircraft now; you make composites.
Imagine a composite material made of say Aluminum metal and
thin (0.1 mm) fibers of superdense material woven into matting which the
aluminum was cast around (or whatever).  Since the matrix material is
Aluminum, you can weld it, cast it, or do whatever else you want with
it.  If you heat it a bit, sheets of it can be formed and bent.
However, the strength and toughness and impact resistance
are primarily in the superdense fibers, as in present-day composites.
Advantages?  The average density is lower than pure superdense,
so the stiffness is increased.  It\'s working characteristics are better
since you can weld it and form it relatively easier.  And the variable
density/hardness characteristics resist penetration better than
homogenous materials.

In the HITCH HIKERS GUIDE to the galaxy series they mention a planet
where they weigh you on arrival and on leaving and if they must match
or you must be lighter to leave otherwise they chop off enough to make
up the difference.

This got me thinking about what a large volume of refuelling vessels
would do to a planetary environment.  Has anyone done any investigation
of the amount of Hydrogen fuel taken from a high tech high population
starport class A world in one year?  Is this a significant effect on
the planetary ecology?  How about over a 10 or 50 or 100 year period?

When would this become a problem and force all refuelling to happen
offworld at gas giants etc?

Just a thought ...

That one is easy. They went as far as they considered was safe to go
without yearly maintenance. If they had thought it safe they would
have gone even farther.

By the same token there could be lots of small independent worlds with small
navies. If we assume that the winners of the conflict that the Swordworlders
lost allowed them to emigrate, but didn\'t allow them to take significant
warships with them, the Swordworlders would not be able to settle outside
Sylean or Vilani space for fear of being raided. Hence the desire to go
somewhere with NO neighbours (quite ironic when one considers the Darrians).

Keep in mind that the leaders who led them corewards in -420 needen\'t be of
the same mind as the leaders who led them to Gram in -399. Inconsistencies
in goals could easily be tied up in internal political struggles.

Environment controls can be added to the cargo hold, by sacrificing
1.05 kl of cargo for an additional control unit.

The speed of the vehicle is rather odd. That\'s because the suspension is
designed, for only 1/6 of the power plant output. If the P/W ratio is
calculated properly with respect to the power, the transmission and
suspension of the vehicle can handle, you get the following results:

    P/W=70, Road=139kph, OffRoad=111kph

but the Design Evaluation Section of the Referee\'s Manual only use the
Power Output of the plant, not the power the vehicle can handle.

The Rough Terrain Walker is build for two purposes:
1. It is a vehicle, for really rough terrain, such as mountains or
   large glaciers.
2. It provides a walking Power Plant for expeditions, where Grav Vehicles
   have difficulties to land, e.g. in very rough terrain, or on planets,
   where strong winds dominate the climate. Up to 45MW of the PowerPlant
   can be derivided to external consumers.

}entails, and I don\'t know of any airline has a major maintainance
}facility there.  If major maintainance is available, I would classify it
}as Class B; otherwise it\'s got to be C.

The 100 hr inspection for aircraft (or annual) is a complete overhaul.
Most airports have the capacity to perform a 100 hr on small aircraft.
Say that a cessna is the equivalent of a small craft, that means
virtually all starports have the capacity to overhaul smallcraft.

O\'Hare is a major hub.  They ought to have capacity to overhaul jumbo
jets.  That means they have the equivalent of overhaul for starships.
That makes it an \'A\' yard.  Yet, they have no \'ship\' yards.

}In my (humble) opinion, starport classification has nothing to do with
}size or amount of traffic.  If a municipal airport rents out one of the
}hangars to a lightplane maintainance and restoration company, and if the
}airport has both AvGas and Jet-A available, then it is class B (overhaul
}available, both kinds of fuel).  Other airports of similar size might be
}Class D, if they only sell AvGas and no repairs are available.  Class E
}might be an "airstrip" out in the outback of Australia - a patch of bare

}More than anything else, I think we are hitting our heads on a major
}limitation in Traveller: not enough detail in the definitions (and too
}few categories to pigeonhole things into).  Probably there sould be some
}detailed starport generation scheme, which detailed the types of
}services available, and the capacity of each one.

Ah, well, this is basically the stand I took in the beginning.  There is
not sufficient detail:  A class \'A\' port does not necessarily mean the
presence of jump capable ship yards.  A class \'B\' port does not necessarily
mean high traffic.

I hereby suggest a traffic code mod for starports:
(sporadic but alphabetical)
H    Heavy:    Vessels up to a million tons.  Major worlds.
M    Medium:   Vessels below 100,000 ton vessels.
L    Light:    Vessels under 1000 tons.  (Player type ships)
O    Occasion: Traffic rarely in system.
Z    Zero:     No traffic in system.   Vessels EXTREMELY rare.

Note that Heavy traffic worlds must of necessity be at most jump-2 or
jump-3 apart from each other to accomodate the jump range of the starships.
(Jump-4 merchants are kinda rare)
Also note that traffic will be proportional to the population &
industry levels.
Further, any type of starport can have nearly any traffic level within
reason.  A class A port could have ship yards and light traffic,
a class E port could have no maintainence but heavy traffic.

}Although you may have a point, I will argue that there\'s no real
}penalty in having a steel hull for most commercial applications.
}In almost all cases, agility is going to be zero anyway, so that
}the mass of the hull is irrellevant; volume of hull material does not
}enter into the design sequence anyway, and the price modifier for steel
}is the same as superdense or bonded superdense - the cheapest available.

}On the other hand, being cheap and low tech, it has relatively few
}control points. [..] This would tend to save on computer and crew
}requirements.

These are holes in the craft design system which don\'t make sence.
I therefore ignore them.
Of COURSE it matters how much a ship masses.  To say it doesn\'t is
just ignoring physical laws which are common sence.  Also, the agility
definition I (and Rob Dean) work with does take ship weight into account.
Also, control points on hulls is a kind of silly idea.  A steel hull
(while easier to build) is gonna require more maintainance than a
stronger material hull like crystal iron (TL 10).  Titanium (TL8) will
require a LOT more work than crystal iron.

More on Xtaliron later when I get around to Catie\'s stuff on hull
materials.

}I do however, know a great deal about submarines

}The way I see it, the problems with builing a hull for a submaine
}& a hull for a traveller space craft can\'t be too different.

Ah, one point about starship hulls vs. sub hulls:  A sub must
take a LOT more pressure than a ship (normally).  The pressure is
also in the opposite direction.  A starship will usually have an
interior pressure of say 6 psi.  (I believe that\'s the pressure in
the NASA Space Shuttle).  The pressure on a sub hull doubles every
time the sub drops a few feet or so.
(Sorry for the English units...)

George Herbert\'s (the naval architect) estimate was that an armor
40 hull could dive to 495 meters purely on the hull strength.
Seems to me that that depth could be augmented by increasing
interior pressure.  After all, with all the gas handling equipment
in the environmental control and the liquid hydrogen fuel, it
should be a simple matter to raise interior pressure.

}The problem, he said, was that you had to make holes in the hull,
}for the drive shaft, for the hatches, for the cooling water
}intakes.  It\'s the holes that are the "weakness" in withstanding
}the great pressure gradients.

}I opine that it\'s advances in making one-piece hulls of
}suitable thickness that\'s the trick.  If you could weld a hull of
}titanium or steel, or better yet, if you grow a single crystal of
}metal into a formed hull, then that\'s what required.

}Early submarines were rivetted together!
}(remember the great scene in Das Boot where they had to dive to
}bottem near Gilbratar, & the rivets starting popping in the hull?)

Great movie...  fave scene...   But making a one piece hull with
stuff like crystal iron is gonna be virtually impossible.  I read
a while back that they are just starting to make crystal iron
turbine blades for jet engines.  A very difficult process:  The
metal is poured into a mold.  To get the metal to crystalize
properly, they have a helical offshoot of the mold to get a seed
crystal in the proper orientation.  ie. inside the helix, crystals
grow with random orientation.  When allowed to cool properly, the
base of the helix will form a seed crystal with the proper
orientation to the turbine blade.  Now this works real nice for
thin turbine blades, as the blades are kinda crystalline in form
anyway, but imagine getting a starship crystalline shaped.  :-P
A one piece crystal hull will be very hard to repair.

Ceramic materials are gonna be rough too.  Why does the US M-1
Abrams Main Battle Tank look so boxy?  Ceramic armor.  (Those are
obviously not one piece hulls)

Composite Laminate ought to be easier to shape, but it is very
difficult to work with.  Patching & repair will be ROUGH.

Titanium:  The Soviets (Russians?) put a BUNDLE into titanium
working.  But the Alfa subs are the deepest diving attack subs
around.  Read Kelly Johnson\'s autobiography "Kelly:  More than my
share of it" p141 (EXCELLENT book) about the problems of building
the titanium SR-71.
Parts would shatter, titanium pieces would get \'poisoned\' when
coming in contact with cadmium tools, and break off, tool bits
would refuse to cut titanium...  The Russians (?) are the only ones
who have a large enough titanium press to build subs hulls.  If
Lockheed\'s skunkworks had such an awful time, there\'s no telling
how much difficulty the builders of the Alfas had.

One of Metlay\'s ideas I really liked (his story in the Horde :-)
was the idea that under some kind of field, superdense armor became
fluid and was workable.  Thus you could make a single piece hull
MUCH easier than you could with any of the other materials
previously mentioned.

}The hull
}perforation problem can be taken care of by arm-waving good enough
}iris hatches.

An iris hatch is still a hole in the hull.  Problem not solved.

}What does super dense really get us anyway?  Perhaps better armour
}for naval & scout ships.  But why invent a new material when what
}we have is sufficient (in my opinion)?  Not only that, but
}consider that those super-dense material are going to be a bitch
}to weld - & that\'s the big problem in my mind anyway!

Horde excerpt:  written by Metlay
"But the real boon, and the discovery that got the corporate gears
turning, was the development of the RAMKS by Provost and Mills in
601. Up until that time, the welding and fitting of superdense
hulls was considered an expensive luxury, due to the difficulties
in getting the impenetrable materials to bond together easily. The
RAMKS (an acronym for Robo-animechaniakatasthyser) was a
man-portable device incorporating fusion and grav technology to
induce superfluid states in confined areas of superdense hullmetal,
allowing smooth joins as easily as two copper pipes could be
soldered together with a brazing torch."

Ok, maybe it is a bunch of handwaving, but so is a lotta trav tech,
and this sounds damn cool.

How\'s that sound?

2G Scott
PS.  2T Matt:
Yeah, sputtering  a hull COULD work, but it would take forever
to get a hull 33mm thick when you are working on depositing
MONOlayers of atoms.  But if you had forever to wait, you could
grow a single crystal hull that way.  Hmmm... A DIAMOND yacht?  :-)
But if crystal growing technology was that good, then there would
be no value to natural crystals.  Something that Trav doesn\'t have.

Its possible that over 1500 years some genetic drift has occured. More likely
is that their internecine conflicts have probably done much to keep them
technologically backwards. Also their language and attitude makes them insular
and little may be known of their physical attributes. Granted that they
have not been militarily very succesful but they have been fighting Imperial
forces atleast 4 TLs above them. If your opponent is in battle dress and armed
with FGMPs enhanced dex/or enhanced ability to take damage does little for
you....

As far as settlement goes. The indications are that the SWs knew of the
Darrians existence when the decided to settle on Gram.


I am still curious to see other people\'s interpretation of why the
Sword Worlders are where they are now.

 ...and shipyards.  Building large ships on the ground and then figuring out
how to lift them to orbit is silly.  They will be built in orbit -- I seem
to recall that A starports (which have shipyards by definition) have an
orbital component by definition.  And, you probably need to be out of the
gravitiy-well to calibrate jump drives.
    As for defining starports, I still think GURPS Space did a better job
with their thumbnail sketches of what a starport Class 0-V (Traveller X-A)
consists of than the Traveller books did.  For campaign use, you would
flesh them out, but I find them a good guideline.  They also used the idea
of a minimum population for the larger starport types, and a population
based dieroll -- the higher the pop, the more likely you were to have a
large starport.  I\'ve included these descriptions below, with Traveller
equivalents in brackets.  GURPS Space uses the same log 10 population digit
Traveller does (called PR below), but the standard die roll is on 3d6,
not 2d6.  Random generation of starport type would mean rolling for
each type, starting with the best and falling back towards the worst
on failure to qualify or blown dierolls.

"Class V [A] -- Full facilities.  Full repair and ship construction
facilities, along with associated Patrol [Patrol/Reserve], Naval, and/or
Survey [Scout] bases. Port has berths for hundreds of vessels, multiple
landing fields, and every facility imaginable -- from crew union halls to
high-tech training facilities.  A Class V port is present only on worlds
of PR 6 or better, on a roll of less than (PR+3).
"Class IV [B] -- Standard facilities.  Full repair and *light* ship
construction facilities[*].  A Patrol or Survey base is attached.  Any
world engaged in regular, substantial trade has *at least* standard
facilities.  A Class IV port is present only on worlds of PR 6 or better,
on a roll of less than (PR+6).
"Class III [C] -- Local facilities.  Repair facilities for common
needs; special parts or complex repairs will require off-planet parts,
technicians, or facilities.  Patrol or Survey may have a base; if not,
there will be at least an office.  Worlds with limited interstellar
commerce have local facilities.   A Class III port is present on a roll
of less than (PR+9).  (If a world does not have at least a Class III
starport, there must be a reason why it gets no regular star traffic.)
"Class II [D] -- Sub-C facilities.  These are intended for inter-
planetary or shuttle craft rather than FTL ships.  Only emergency repairs
are available for starships, but common fuel types are available.  A Patrol
office may be found here, perhaps accompanied by a Survey office if the
world is isolated.  A Class II port is present on a roll of less
than (PR+8).
"Class I [E] -- Emergency facilities.  No real starport -- only a
landing area.  Marked by automatic buoys, it might be a cleared-off,
flattened space or a small orbital station. [reference to potential FTL
message beacons deleted].  A Class I port may be unmanned, or it may have
local customs and security offices [Cynthia mumbles, "Muskoka airport *is*
a Port of Entry for Canada, and *does* have a customs officer, even if
he has to drive out from town while you wait on the pad..."]  Emergency
parts and fuel are stored nearby.  If qualified technicians are available,
the buoys will have contact information.  Class I facilities are present
on a roll of 14 or less.
"Class 0 [X] -- No facilities.  There isn\'t even a designated landing
site -- ships planning to land must look for suitable terrain.  If the
world has a high enough tech level, there will be an airport, parking lot,
or wide roadway.

"Orbital vs. Ground ports. Depending on the campaign\'s FTL technology,
starports may be in orbit or on the ground.  Ground ports service shuttles
and landing-capable starships; an orbital port allows non-landing starships
to dock, and provides shuttles to the surface.  If a world has two ports,
the older often has poorer facilities, lower rates, and a less
selective clientele.  A well-developed world will have at least one
shuttleport or ground starport on every continent.
 "Special starports.  Other starports, not specifically included in
a world\'s rating, include: company ports (servicing only one company and
its clients), military or Patrol, and government.  These can usually be
used by any ship in an emergency, if the facility isn\'t secret."
-- GURPS Space, 1st ed, p.122

[*] light construction -- for the purposes of my Traveller campaigns,
I interpret that to mean that B starport yards can build jump ships of up
to 5000 tons in size -- coincidentally increasing the absolute and
relative numbers of Classic Traveller starships flying around space...
Note that worlds with more than a million inhabitants rate to have
at least a C starport; note that worlds with less than a million inhabitants
can have no better than a C starport.  Worlds with 3 guys and a major
shipyard are impossible under this system.

Sulaiman in reference to the Sworld Worlders:

For some reason I always thought they went by way of the Reft; this leaves the
question of "Why didn\'t they settle in the Trojan Reaches?"  Well, if you look 
at the
T.R. map, you notice a lot of worlds with classically Terran names (not Vilani, 
not
Sylean, not Imperial, but Earth-flavored).  I suspect that either (a) other 
Terran
groups beat them there (possibly during the Rule of Man), or (b) the Sword 
Worlds are a spin-off of the Trojan Reaches worlds -- maybe they couldn\'t get
  along with them.

    The "losers of a war" scenario was the first thing I thought of when I read 
the
questions raised in the original post.  It need not have been the "Gene War".  
If they
had been sufficiently obnoxious in the course of whatever war they lost, they 
and their
kin might be persona non grata anywhere in Terran space -- kind of like known 
members of
the SS & Gestapo after WWII.  Or if they were the targets of genocidal pogroms 
by the
victors for reasons other than being "supermen" they might have had to run far 
and fast
in a direction they didn\'t expect the victorious Terrans to expand in -- 
preferably with
lots of other people between them and the Terrans.  All of the questions about 
why the Sword
Worlds are "way, way out here" are explained if the Sword Worlders were 
desperately
*afraid* of the Terrans they left behind.
Hmmm, this could be useful.  Right now, I have some players in the "Sword"
Worlds, and have been working some stuff out about current (as of 1112, anyway) 
Sword
World/Border World politics.  It was 1500 years ago that they fled Terra -- but,
 hey,
the Assyrians still have a bad reputation after 3-4000 years.

wildstart said some time ago:
>What about the issue of "all sentient life-forms are protected citizens of the 
Imperium"?

My first reaction to reading about the DEYO chips was, "The Imperium has been 
doing
forced eugenics/breeding, lobotomizing, and enslavement of a sentient species.  
Does
someone see something wrong here?"  My second reaction was very much akin to 
Scott Kellogg\'s.
If I were a sentient being in these circumstances, I just might accumulate a 
little
outright hatred of humanity.  Sounds like the old "major race/minor race" 
prejudice and
second-class species system found fertile ground to bloom in...
    Since I haven\'t gotten *to* the Rebellion period yet, I am more than 
interested in
seeing your "reams of stuff", Wildstar.

There\'s nothing in the material we have about the Swordworlders to suggest
that they are genetically superior in any way. The character generation
system in JTAS #18 specifically says they aren\'t.

What indications? I agree that it is strange that they didn\'t find the

I have played Star Cruiser on a number of occasions, and have not yet
see a scenario or playing style that has resulted in "lines of battle
trading broadsides".  Combat between stutterwarp-powered ships in Star
Cruiser seem to look "much closer to those found in aerial dogfights".

Simply changing the drive technology will not cause the form of the
battle to change the way you want; the "shape" of a battle comes not only
from the method of propulsion of the ships, but also the nature of
communications, sensor, and weapons technology.

First, you must decide what "shape" you want the combat to be.  By
"lines of battle trading broadsides" do you mean like Nelson at
Trafalgar, or like Beatty\'s battlecruisers at Jutland?  I personally
feel that Traveller ship-to-ship combat should be more like modern naval
combat, with its sophisticated communications, weapons, sensors, and
countermeasures.  In any case, I strongly urge you (and others on the
GDW design staff) to read Keegan\'s "The Price of Admiralty".  This book
describes the battles of Trafalgar, Jutland, Midway, and of a north
Atlantic convoy; most importantly, Keegan explains why each battle
unfolded as it did.

Unless stutterwarp efficency in Traveller: The New Era is reduced by a
factor of at least 10 relative to that presented in 2300AD, stutterwarp
is cheaper and more efficient that jump drive.  *ANY* Classic Traveller
or MegaTraveller starship design can be refitted with a Star Cruiser
stutterwarp.  The resultant vessel will travel faster, cost less, and
have more space available for weapons or cargo that the original design.
But don\'t take my word for it, try it yourself!

Delta-vee drives will always be required on most designs, due to the
need to land on planetary surfaces.  This may mean shuttles or landing
boats with delta-vee drives, or (particularly for small merchant ships,
where handling the cargo would be difficult) installing delta-vee drives
on the starship itself.  IF (and only if) the jump drive is more
economically efficient than stutterwarp, then commercial ships will
probably not have stutterwarps.  So far, so good.

Because of the tactical advantage conferred by the stutterwarp in
ship-to-ship combat, every military ship (and this would have to include
pirateships, raiders, and the like) will need one.  If the jump drive is
a more efficient way of interstellar transport, then military starships
will need them too.  Delta-vee drives may not be required, depending on
the mission required of the ship.

Now for the sticky part.  Obviously, the first interstellar state able
to equip its warships with stutterwarp drives is in a position to
dominate its rivals in a big way.  As I understand the New Era
background, you don\'t want this to happen.  Therefore, one of two things
must have happened: Those who hold the monopoly on stutterwarp are
unwilling or unable to use it for warfare; or the secret of the
stutterwarp was rapidly disseminated to all of the major states.
Plausible explanations for either of these alternatives seem difficult
to generate.  Perhaps the secret of the stutterwarp was distributed by
the Hivers in an attempt to create some type of buffer zone against
incursions of (something ... vampire ships?).  OK, it\'s probably
workable.

Now, what will everything look like from a game point of view?  Battles
between ships without stutterwarp are likely to be rare (although this
does depend on the relative abundance of stutterwarp drives).  Most
ship-to-ship battles will be fought between stutterwarp powered ships,
and the battles will probably be reminiscent of modern air-to-air
combat.

> So what do you think? Nothing has been finalized yet about

Stutterwarp *COULD* be an interesting addition to the New Era game.  It
would have to be handled with skill and careful consideration in order
to work.  From GDW\'s performance to date with the New Era background,
and from what I have read above, I doubt that anyone at GDW could do it.
I\'m sorry to have to say that; I know it hurts and I would like to be
proven wrong.  However, after the "virus" story, where you had all of
the right elements together in one place, and then managed to somehow
put them together so completely wrong, I have little faith in the
imagination and vision of the staff in control of Traveller: The New
Era.  I also believe that adding stutterwarp to TNE will not achieve
your stated goal; and the result will leave you unsatisfied.

SO, if you want to include stutterwarp in TNE, I strongly suggest
thinking it through several times (including the military, economic, and
political ramifications) and changing things until they fit properly.
Then playtest the heck out of it before you decide what the final
version is going to look like.  If you don\'t have the luxury of enough
time or money to do this, then by all means don\'t include it.

If I can be of any assistance, please let me know.  In addition to
playtesting, proofreading, and sanity checking, I have a delta-vee type
movement system that is much simpler than Mayday, while providing a
similar or better level of accuracy.  I also have a "virus" story which
you may be able to use as a retroactive change to that which has been
published (is anyone here on TML interested in either one?).

It does depend on where the hit occurs.  An average character has a chest
value of 60, but a head value of only 20.  Anything over 20 pts to the
head is a guaranteed unconscious result.  Anything over 40 to the head is
death.  You can work the numbers out yourself.  In the basic game (for
obvious reasons I didn\'t buy the add-ons) a 9mm pistol does 1d6 per hit,
a 5.56N assault rifle does 2d6 per hit, and a .50 caliber MG does 8d6
per hit.  So you really wouldn\'t need that many machine gun bullets to
kill...only 5 or 6 for torso hits and 2 for the head.  (-:  It\'s those
smaller weapons that are a problem.  After 15 or so pistol bullets to
the chest, you _might_ fall down.  (Hmmm...how many bullets in a Browning
HiPower?)

It depends on where it hits.  Since a 120mm DS round (non-uranium) does
28 dice of damage, and an average character has 60 hit points in the chest
area, 28*3.5=98 points of average damage.  98 points of damage to the chest
would be a "serious" wound.  (No s***!)  This means that the average
character would be seriously wounded by such a hit, and would only have
(?!) a 10% chance of remaining conscious.  The second hit would probably
finish him off....if he\'s hit in the head, he\'s dead.

     You\'ve seen my explanation why they are where they are
location-wise.  Why are they at "only" TL 9-12 when their neighbors have
High Stellar civilizations?  How about this propensity for nuking each
other in civil wars when they aren\'t getting nuked by the Imperium?
Rebuilding from continual civil wars tends to drain the economy of
resources that could otherwise be used for education, research and
development.  Early to Average Stellar is a high enough Tech Level that
you can make a comfortable place to live on *any* world, so there is no
necessity to drive advancement.  One side effect of continual warfare in
the Real World (tm?) I would expect to see in the Sword Worlds: higher
military (personal & heavy weaponry, military vehicles) TLs than other
TLs.  Sword World businesses may use computers not much more advanced than
our own, but *all* Sword World armies are probably equipped with nice,
shiny, lethal gauss rifles.  (Imported from the Husqvarna factories on
Sacnoth, natch).  Reserve units probably have good ACRs, at the *worst*.
(Mauser-Gram exports a rather nice one; so does Beretta of Narsil).

     I hate to disagree with a man in his area of expertise, but the 100
hour inspection is *NOT* a complete overhaul.  An overhaul is a complete
overhaul.  Big difference in cost and legally required mechanical
certifications.  Way back many years when my father owned a Navion, his
WWII training was sufficient to tear down the engine for annual inspection
- -- which means you open up every damn access panel in the plane and pull
every thing off the engine so the inspector can poke and peek and confirm
that all the parts are there in working order.  Then you put all the
panels and parts back -- but nothing is replaced.  An overhaul, on the
other hand, requires Certified Mechanics, and means taking the engine
apart and rebuilding it, if my memories are correct.  The expense is such
that it is something to be avoided, usually by selling the plane before it
gets too close to requiring an overhaul.
     IMHO, for starport equivalents, any airport with shops capable of
doing an engine overhaul would equate to a starport capable of doing an
annual overhaul: A or B.  An annual inspection equivalent can be done by
the engineer on your crew, with the tools he better well have; legal
requirements might require a local or Imperial inspector to do the looking
over at a starport where the inspector had an office (none X or E, rare at
D).

     I disagree.  Partially.  I contend that a class A port must have
heavy traffic, and class B ports must have medium to heavy traffic, simply
to pay for the facilities present.  Except in special cases, where someone
is willing to subsidize major facilities for other purposes, good
facilities *other than yards* will exist only where the traffic can
support them.  Megacorporate shipyards may well exist wherever the builder
feels is convenient to construct ships; local shipyards will exist only on
worlds with enough spacegoing business that they can expect to sell ships
there.  I consider megacorporate yards (like the LSP and General yards in
various places) to be an example of the "special case" cited above.
However, worlds with such yards should have TL equivalent to what\'s being
built.
        However, I do concede that a place with a lousy starport could
have a lot of traffic.  This should be a temporary condition; if there\'s a
lot of traffic, it can support better facilities, and someone will
probably build them.  Or, poor facilities will discourage traffic, and the
volume will drop off.  Hmmm.  One could make a case for low traffic A & B
ports being similarly temporary conditions -- either the good facilities
will attract traffic, or lack of traffic to support the facilities will
cause them to be degraded thru lack of maintenance and support.
        To generalize from this: world UPPs are snapshots (we all know
this).  The less logical a particular UPP is, the more likely it is to be
a temporary condition.  This kind of UPP should be revised by the Referee
as appropriate; what the PCs encounter, and what is published in the
update column of the Wall Street Journal (Library Data edition) will not
match the UPP in the Official Third Imperial Grand Survey.

        What does size of the vessel have to do with how much traffic a
system sees?   I personally think that a port that sees 120,000 Free
Traders a year rates a higher traffic rating than a port that sees one
100,000 ton bulk hauler a year.  I suggest you rate traffic by Aggregate
Tons of ships (not cargo) rather than by tonnage of individual vessels.
Say:

H       Heavy:          over 100 million aggregate tons of shipping a
                        year.
                        - typical year for Trin or Terra.
                        - The Corridor Fleet passes through once.
M       medium:         10 million - 100 million tons a year.
                        - typical year for Efate.
                        - A CruRon patrols here once a month.
L       Light:          100,000 - 10 million tons a year.
                        - one Tigress a year on patrol
                        - 1 light merchant (200-400 tons) a day.
O       Occasional:     1000 - 100,000 tons a year.
                        - One free trader a month.
                        - One Naval Supply Ship a year.
Z       Zero:           less than 1000 tons a year.
                        -"A free trader every other month.  Maybe."

A while back, Catie asks:
        >How do make super-dense, by the way?

        Use gravitics to grow maximum strength nickel-iron crystal
lattices, like may exist in the upper layers of a neutron star\'s crust?
Use superheavies and handwaving?  Do bizarre things with gravitics and
ceramics?  Or gravitics and polymers?  Use meson-based atoms?  I dunno.  I
accept that advanced technology could create something tougher than
single-crystal metals without knowing the details.
        I tend to reserve degenerate matter and meson atoms for
explanations of Monadium; they are too high tech and too tough to be
Superdense.  (BTW, degenerate matter is Really Neat Stuff -- and its
characteristics match almost all the observed characteristics of Monadium
except one).

Let\'s run some simple calculations here.

Assume a million (1e6) ships per year, and that each takes a million
tons of LH2. This is likely to exceed the traffic at *any* planet by a
good margin.

So we have 1e6 x 1e6 = 1e12 tons of hydrogen leaving annually. Water is
H2O. By weight it\'s 1/9th hydrogen, 8/9ths oxygen. So that means we need
9e12 tons of water to supply that hydrogen. 9e12 tons is 9e18 grams. One
gram of water occupies one cubic centimeter. So that\'s 9e18 cm^3 or 9e12
m^3 or 9e3 km^3. (a cube a mere 20 km on a side)

We\'ll asssume that this is an average (size 7) planet, with an average
hydro %age (70%). Much like earth. So the surface area of the planet is
4pi r^2 km. That\'s 6e8 km^2. Times 70% is 4e8 km^2.

Divide the volume of water by the surface area of the oceans, and you
get 2e-5 km or 2e-2 m or 2 cm.

So with that *huge* outflow, we\'ve managed to lower the oceans by a
whole 2 centimeters.

(somebody please check my calculations. I\'m surprised we got that much
of a drop!)

    'body' => 'In my opinion, the vector movement rules for MAYDAY were needlessly complex
and difficult to understand.  I have a successful variant which I will
detail below.  GDW has my express (and non-exclusive) permission to use
this system in TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA (a mention in the acknowledgments
might be nice, though).  I may eventually expand these into a boardgame,
similar to MAYDAY, if enough people are interested.

A hex map is used as the playing surface (I use a MegaMat vinyl gaming mat
with 25mm hexes).  Two counters are required for each ship, missile, or
other unit in the game.  One counter represents the unit, and is called a
"ship marker"; the other is called a "vector marker".  Both markers should
be able to indicate a direction; on the map markers may face in any of the
twelve directions (hex-sides and hex-corners).  I use a picture of a
starship or missile on the ship markers, and an arrow on the vector
markers, as the primary symbol.  The pairs of markers should be labeled and
color-coded for easy recognition of the pairs.  I use colors to identify
the different sides, and numbers to distinguish between the units on a
given side.  Asteroids, as well as moons, planets, stars and their
associated gravitational fields are drawn on the map (although these
objects move, they are effectively stationary for the duration of the
combat).  The map is scaled so that one gravity of acceleration for one
turn produces a velocity of one hex per turn (the size of the hex is then
dependent on the length of the turn chosen).  Each unit in the game also
has a control sheet, which is used to record information as the game
progresses.  Each turn is divided into several phases: the initiative
phase, the vector phase, the launch phase, the sensor phase, the movement
phase, the combat phase, and the records phase.

At the start of each turn, all of the ship markers will be stacked on top
of their respective vector markers; however, the ship and vector markers
may be facing in different directions.  Information recorded on the control
sheet will show the speed, acceleration, and agility of each ship for the
coming turn.  In the initiative phase, initiative is determined for each
side.  In all subsequent phases, the side with the highest initiative
designates which unit goes first; the side with the next highest initiative
designates the next unit, and so on in the case of a multi-sided battle.
Homing missiles, stern chases, and unguided or unpiloted units ignore
initiative; homing missiles with a lock-on, and the pursuer in a stern
chase, act immediately after their target.  Unguided or unpiloted units,
including homing missiles with no lock-on, always act last, after all
normal units have acted.

In the vector phase, each ship is moved in accordance with its vector.  It
is moved in the direction indicated by its vector marker, for a number of
hexes equal to its speed.  Units with a speed of zero do not move.  In the
launch phase, missiles, mines, deadfall ordinance and subordinate craft are
launched.  Sensor lock-ons from previous turns may be required for some
types of weapons to be able to launch.  Counters for these units are placed
on the map, and control sheets started.  Ordinance and subordinate craft
are placed in the same hex as the launching unit, with the same speed, and
with their vector marker in the same hex and pointing in the same direction
as the launching unit\'s vector marker.

In the sensor phase, sensor scans are conducted, and weapon lock-ons are
established, and electronic countermeasures are attempted.  The results are
written onto the control sheet.  Weapon lock-ons are required for most
weapons to fire.  In my variant, I use restricted arcs of fire, so exactly
which weapons have lock-ons to what targets can become critically
important.

In the movement phase, each unit is moved by the controlling player.  For
each gravity of acceleration the unit has, it may turn to face any
direction, and optionally move one hex forward.  Units with no acceleration
may turn to face any direction, but may not move.  After the unit has
finished its movement, the effects of gravity are applied.  An imaginary
line is projected from the vector marker to the ship marker.  If the line
passes through a gravity hex, or if the vector marker (but not the ship
marker) is in a gravity hex, then the ship marker is moved according to the
effects of the gravity.  Gravity hexes are marked with an arrow containing
a number.  The arrow is the direction the ship marker is to be moved, and
the number specifies the number of hexes.  Ship markers which have managed
to end up on a hex-line are "rounded", by moving them to one of the two
adjacent hexes of the owning player\'s choice.

In the combat phase, each unit fires its weapons at a target (in most
cases, a weapon lock-on must be present on the target in order to fire).
Fire is resolved immediately, and damage is applied immediately.  In the
records phase, cumulative damage results are computed and recorded.  The
distance from each vector marker to its corresponding ship marker is
counted, and this number becomes that unit\'s speed for the next turn.  The
vector marker is then turned to point to the ship marker, and is placed
under the ship marker (taking care to preserve the facing of both markers).

This system gives a reasonable, but not exact approximation of Newtonian
mechanics.  A much better approximation can be had by introducing a third
counter, the "position marker" for each unit.  The position marker simply
indicates a position on the map, so a circle was used for its symbol.  In
this system, the scale is changed, so that one gravity of acceleration for
one turn produces a velocity of two hexes per turn.  The position marker
begins the turn under the vector marker.  The game is played as before,
with the following exceptions during the movement phase: First, the vector
marker is moved each time the ship marker is moved, but in the opposite
direction.  Second, gravitational effects are computed using an imaginary
line projected from the position marker to the ship marker.  If the line
passes through a gravity hex, or if the position marker is in a gravity
hex, then the ship marker is moved as before.  Finally, in the records
phase, the position marker is placed underneath the vector and ship markers
(taking care to preserve the facing of the vector and ship markers).  Note
that if there are no gravity hexes on the map, the position marker is
irrellevant and can be omitted.

    'body' => 'The following contains my detailed comments on the GDW "virus" scenario,
and details on an alternative that many of you might find more attractive.

I am willing to support the New Era as a Traveller role-playing background.
Although the virus is only a vehicle to get from the Hard Times of the
Rebellion into the New Era, it is a plot device that must be effective and
believable.  If the purchasers of TRAVELLER: THE NEW ERA cannot believe in
the plot devices of the background history, then they will not be able to
suspend their disbelief during the course of the game.  This will cause the
game to fail in the marketplace.

In the paragraphs below, I will be presenting a detailed critique of the
virus as it was presented by GDW.  This is not intended to be derogatory or
destructive.  For all of the points I will raise, I have provided at least
one answer; my intent is to provide a believable plot device which does the
job required.  If you do not want to hear criticism, then skip ahead; the
reasons why I think that parts of the current story are untenable are not
vital to the discussion.  However, I will present (at the end of the
discussion of the virus) what I feel is a much more believable and cohesive
plot device, which uses nearly the same elements as the virus presented
here, and which produces the same results.  I hope you will chose to accept
these in the spirit in which they are offered; I give GDW my express
permission to use this scenario or an adaptation of it in TRAVELLER: THE
NEW ERA (a mention in the acknowledgments would be nice, though).

I have two sets of objections to the GDW virus.  One set, is based on the
information presented in Signal GK, the other being more fundamental in
nature.  I strongly suggest re-reading the adventure.  A detailed reading
of Signal GK shows that some of the Cymbeline life-forms contain circuit
fragments derived from a common type of amplifier chip found in many
Imperial devices, including transponders.  In other words, Imperial
transponders do not contain sophont computer chips, but rather the sophont
computer chips evolved to incorporate transponder circuit fragments.  The
adventure also allows us to date the discovery of these life-forms at less
than twenty years before the onset of the Rebellion.  Even if they proved
to be an immediate commercial success, this is hardly enough time for them
to have become universally used in Imperial commerce.

Furthermore, even if one knew nothing about the events that transpired in
Signal GK, it seems very unlikely that if the Imperium had the ability to
construct and use sophont computer chips, that they would be used in
transponders as described above.  If they were, it seems even more unlikely
that they were not used in other applications.  It seems much more likely
that in this case sophont computers and robots would be ubiquitous
throughout the Imperium and surrounds.

In addition, the use of these beings in such devices seems to be in direct
disregard of the long-stated Imperial policy "All sophont life-forms within
the Imperium are Imperial citizens, and are therefore protected".  The
Cymbeline computer chips are indeed naturally-evolved life-forms
(admittedly with a very unusual biochemistry) which are indeed sophonts.
So it seems that the Imperium is now in the business of breeding slave
races.

Finally, there seems to be little need for a great amount of intelligence
in a transponder system.  Transponders are used for navigation, traffic
control and to identify a vessel to the authorities and to other vessels.
Transponder is a contraction of "Transmitter-Responder", which describes
the function quite well.  It transmits a response (typically consisting of
the vessel\'s name, identification, position, course, and speed) whenever it
receives an inquiry signal (typically whenever the vessel carrying the
transponder is scanned by an active sensor system).  It hardly requires a
microprocessor, let alone a sophont computer chip.

It seems highly unlikely that any responsible naval architect would use a
device which could be reprogrammed by radio commands in the transponder
system of a starship.  Furthermore, if one were used, it seems criminally
negligent for that device to be allowed any sort of direct access to the
central control computer.  It stretched credibility beyond the breaking
point to suggest that an enslaved sentient being would be allowed intimate,
overriding access to the central control system of a starship.  The field
of electronic engineering abounds with devices designed specifically to
isolate sensitive or critical parts of a system from unpredictable external
effects.  They are used to protect computers and other sensitive equipment
from electrical shock or chemical contamination, and they would be used
here to isolate the transponder from the more vital computer systems of the
spacecraft.

The idea of uncontrollable technology and "vampire ships" sounds
interesting, playable, and believable.  As part of the New Era background,
examples of the virus will probably still be present at the fringes of
inhabited space.  Periodic "bug hunts" may even be necessary to open up new
areas of space, and to keep the virus from encroaching on the remaining
areas of civilization.  My only problem with the virus is with the plot
device as presented, and not the plot lines and adventures thus produced.
The virus is a creature, with a habitat, life-cycle, needs and desires.
Since it is a sophont, it also has a psychology and a culture.  In the
admittedly brief description given, the creature is poorly detailed, and
some of the features do not seem to make sense: that the creature
reproduces by broadcasting radio signals to host sophonts which have been
incorporated into commonly-used devices; and that it then programs its
personality into any nearby computer, and proceeds to kill any humans it
encounters.

Start reading again here, if you have been skipping over the discussion of
the virus.  I would like to propose a variation, which I believe will
result in a much more believable story (and may even allow additional plots
to be developed during the course of a game).  I should point out that the
following outline does not require sophont computer chips in common
Imperial devices, nor does it require the virus to spread by radio
communications.

Let me start with Lucan\'s secret-weapon laboratories.  The Cymbeline
life-forms were undoubtedly known to scientists in the Imperial core, and
considered as possible weapons.  They have several unique properties: they
are small, intelligent, can reproduce, and are self-mobile.  In their
natural habitat, they receive energy and food (silicon and trace elements)
from their environment.  Applying the principles of genetic engineering,
and the techniques of advanced electronic engineering, Lucan\'s researchers
created a "tailored" organism that is related to the original Cymbeline
predator in much the same way that a fully-trained and equipped U.S.
Marine is like a modern inner-city teenager.  Because they create or mimic
conventional computer viruses, and because of their rapid transmission from
world to world, these creatures have become known as "The Virus".  As they
have spread throughout inhabited space, additional adaptations and
variations have emerged, creating different strains of the virus.  The
following description of the creature\'s life cycle is necessarily general;
individual strains can be as different as each referee\'s imagination.
Thousands, if not millions, of different strains have developed since the
virus was created, and new strains will be created for as long as the
creatures continue to exist.

The virus has a four-stage life cycle.  In the first, or egg stage, they
are inert.  The eggs consist of a dormant silicon life-form, encased in a
protective plastic or epoxy shell along with some of the silicon, trace
elements, and other materials that the creature will need to grow to its
next stage.  The eggs of each different strain of the virus have a
different external appearance.  Some look like random blobs and scraps of
plastic; others mimic the exteriors of common commercial electronic
components (in some cases down to the exact markings).  Depending on the
strain, eggs can range from less than a gram to several hundred grams in
mass.  Some eggs hatch after a given amount of time, while others require
some external event.  Many of the mimics require electrical power to hatch
(typically, the mimic expects to be inserted into a circuit instead of a
genuine replacement part, where it then hatches right in the midst of all
the things it needs in order to grow).  Many of the larger eggs contain a
technical library on the types of targets the virus was originally intended
to attack: robots, computers, communications devices, and starships.  The
library contains as much compressed and encoded technical data as Lucan\'s
engineers could pack into it.  In some later, mutant strains this data is
now garbled, incomplete, or missing.  Later stages of the virus can use
this library as they attack their targets.  The egg stage is both tough and
vulnerable: while the eggs cannot defend themselves, they are resistant to
most environmental threats: they are not harmed by vacuum, pressure, most
liquids, and are more resistant to corrosive chemicals, radiation, and
electric shock than at any other stage.  Physically destroying the egg, or
the application of enough radiation, will kill them.  The virus has no need
of atmosphere, and is resistant to high pressures at all stages of its
life-cycle.

During the second stage, the larva stage, the creature vaguely resembles an
insect; it has probes, manipulators, tools and other appendages, and is
generally protected by a hard plastic exoskeleton.  Larvae are typically
mobile, although the methods of locomotion differ; some crawl or walk,
while others fly with wings or tiny grav generators.  They wander about in
search of the things they need to grow: a source of silicon, electrical
power, and several trace elements.  Their primary motivation at this stage
is to eat and grow.  Almost any high-tech artifact as at least some of the
materials they need, and most strains have preferred food-sources.
Although they are not yet sophont, they are at the high end of animal
intelligence, and as they grow, they become more intelligent.  In many
strains, the larvae can communicate by radio signals, so that any resource
found by one larva is instantly made known to all the rest.  The net effect
of the larval stage is very similar to that of Doyle\'s Eel: frequent and
seemingly random systems malfunctions as the growing larvae consume vital
circuits.  In the second stage, the creatures can be killed by starvation
(depriving them of sources of energy, and sufficient materials to grow).
Many strains are more vulnerable to chemical attack at this stage than at
any other.

At the start of the third, or adult stage, the creature\'s mental capacity
expands greatly with two immediate results: the creatures become true
sophonts, and they are able to unpack their libraries.  Prior to this
stage, the library was carried around in compressed and encoded format.
Although more compact, this limited the creature\'s ability to access the
information.  With the library unpacked, the now-sophont adults have
nearly-instant access to technical data on almost any Imperial-era data
processing, communications, computer, robotic, or starship system.  The
primary motivation of an adult is to find a suitable nest; robots, starship
computer systems, and vehicles are good nests.  The requirement is
someplace which has a source of electrical energy, and sufficient
quantities of silicon and trace elements for the creature to both grow and
reproduce.  Large, mobile nests are preferred, although some strains exist
where the larvae are migratory and the adult is stationary.  The adult form
is quite dangerous, because it is an intelligent sophont, still small, is
capable of independent motion, and can communicate, typically by radio,
with others of its kind.  An adult can abandon its nest if necessary, and
survive independently until it can establish a new nest.  At this stage, it
can physically invade vehicles and vessels, and is quite capable of
modifying or reprogramming them to suit its own ends.  Many strains are
quite good at computer programming, and can write conventional computer
viruses to gain access to any computer system.  Typically at least as
intelligent as a human, they have rapid access to more technical data than
most humans even posses.  These creatures can subvert the security of a
computer system faster than a human observer can realize what is going on.
Once established in a nest, the virus takes over the functions of the
robot, vehicle, or starship.  Using available raw materials, many eggs are
produced and placed in likely locations.  Many of the mimic strains
establish nests in maintenance or factory robots, and place their eggs in
parts bins, or install them in the devices that they build or repair.
Equipment controlled by the adult virus can appear to go berserk, or
perform all sorts of destructive actions.  The most insidious strains are
those that appear to continue the original function of their nest, and
unobtrusively spread eggs and larvae wherever they go.

Due to the conditioning provided by Lucan\'s researchers, most strains of
the virus consider other sophonts to be a threat, and will make the most of
any opportunity to eliminate them.  An attempt was also made to implant
conditioning so that adults would shun Lucan\'s area of space, and avoid
building nests in his ships and computers.  Although relatively successful
in the first few generations of the virus, this conditioning was weakened
by mutation, and by the final stage of the creature, which Lucan\'s
scientists did not foresee.  The strains of the virus that originated in
Lucan\'s labs also contained a radio-controlled "sleep" circuit, to allow
researchers to activate and de-activate larvae and adults.  This circuit
was not expected to survive the first generation of the virus, but was
necessary to in order to safely handle and distribute it.  The library is a
form of racial memory for the virus; through it, adult creatures can pass
their knowledge to their offspring.  While the library originally contained
only technical information about possible targets, an adult creature can
alter the contents of the library that they pass on to their offspring, and
thereby pass whatever information they feel is important to the survival of
their strain.  Adults can also create offspring which are deliberate
mutations of themselves; typically by modifying the characteristics of the
egg or larva stages, and by varying the contents of the library.

The final stage in the life-cycle of the virus is the colony stage.  If the
conditions are right, an adult can form the nucleus of a colony of
interdependent creatures.  The adult continues to grow and becomes the
primary intelligence of a community of related creatures (almost always the
descendants of the original, controlling adult).  A colony can be formed in
a starship, on a vehicle, or in any other environment where a the colony
can be permanently established.  The adult continues to grow until it is
effectively immobile, becoming the core of the colony.  It starts producing
new strains of offspring tailored to its needs, including ones to gather
resources, and others to repair, maintain and modify the colony\'s
environment.  Each of these drones are intelligent, but most are not true
sophonts; instead they depend on the core for their higher functions and
motivations.  A colony is a very dangerous opponent, and is more
intelligent than most humans.  Although well-protected by drones and other
defenses, the core is immobile and vulnerable to physical attack and
disruption of its power supply.

Lucan released the virus in two ways, nearly simultaneously: Spies and
agents planted eggs of a mimic strain in the parts supplies of factories
and repair facilities throughout his enemy\'s empires.  Adults and larvae
were also released from cargo modules placed aboard merchant starships
headed toward enemy-controlled areas.  Agents of Dulinor obtained some
samples of the virus, but inadvertently activated them; so the Federation
of Ilelish was treated to a preview of what was to spread rapidly to all of
Lucan\'s enemies.  The near-simultaneous outbreak of the virus throughout
known space, combined with the speed with which it could reproduce,
overwhelmed efforts at combating it.  In many cases, the ships which
carried news of the virus also carried eggs, larvae, or adults.  Deneb was
spared the initial effects of the virus because of the lack of
communications through Corridor.  Norris was also lucky, because
information about the virus eventually arrived in the Domain, carried by an
uninfected ship.  Effective (although severe) countermeasures were
developed, and due to the infrequent nature of contact with the rest of the
Imperium, were in place before an infected ship arrived.

In many cases, adult creatures wrote or modified computer programs to
prepare the way for their invasion.  Conventional computer viruses were
written by the creatures and attached to library data programs,
entertainment software, or inserted into other types of software.  These
programs were frequently designed to mimic a hardware malfunction, so that
eggs could be inserted into the computer system in question by an
unsuspecting human, or by an infected repair robot.  In other cases, these
altered computer programs would subvert security systems designed to
prevent unauthorized access to the computer center, allowing the creatures
to infiltrate.  Because of the speed with which the virus spread, and
because of the use of altered computer programs to prepare the way for the
creatures; the creatures became known as "The Virus".  Because the exact
techniques of infection were numerous and varied, popular suspicion arose
that the virus could spread through any form of computer to computer
contact, even through software exchanges or by radio contact with an
infected device.

Although their primary motivations are to grow and reproduce, the virus has
a built-in hatred of, and fear and loathing for humans.  This conditioning,
implanted by Lucan\'s scientists, cause the virus to attempt to avoid,
destroy or drive off humans in or around areas where they are active.  As
larvae, or as adults without a nest, the creatures prefer to avoid humans,
but may attack if cornered or if there is a good chance of killing the
human without undue risk.  Adults with established nests, and colonies will
attempt to kill humans, too.  Their greater resources and greater
intelligence make them more than a match for most opponents.  Thus,
computer-controlled machinery can appear to go berserk, and start killing
people.  Colonies based aboard starships can become "vampire ships", and
are quite capable of performing their own repairs and maintenance.  Many
will need raw materials, repair parts, or technical data.  A high-tech
computerized and robotically staffed shipyard could even become a vampire
haven; building and repairing ships and vehicles for other colonies.

Each adult creature or colony is a sophont individual, and each will have
its own set of needs, desires, and goals.  Many early generations of the
virus these will be some variation of survive, grow, reproduce, and kill
humans.  Later generations may mutate considerably, and individual referees
should feel free to create almost any type of creature to support the needs
of their campaign.  By the opening of the New Era, all of these creatures
will be competing for increasingly scarce resources.  Different creatures
may co-operate, trade, compete for resources, or even fight one another.
Some colonies may want to find new pockets of civilization to infect, and
new opponents to conquer.  Some may consider competing colonies more
dangerous than the feeble strugglings of the remaining humans.  Others may
have tired of death and destruction, and instead simply want to be left
alone to live and let live.  Yet others may have started to wonder about
the philosophical questions that have occupied all kinds of sophonts for
all time, or may be searching for their ultimate origins, or exploring the
universe in which they live.

Actually, at 8d6 per hit, one in the head should kill you.  Or two to three
in the chest.

One.  A 120mm APFSDSDU penetrator does 28d6 damage, plus 28 points
blunt trauma.  The character has 30 hit points in the chest (average),
and so goes to -68 in his chest, which will leave hiom critically

Keep in mind that Twilight was deliberately designed to give the PCs an
abnormally high survival chance in normal combat.  Presumably because
they were trying to simulate the Action/Adventure flick, where "our hero"

still beat the bad guys, save the babe(s), and fly back home to live happily

 Yes. The D20 system is described in the Twilight: 2000/Merc: 2000
 Ref\'s Screen, for $5.50.

 The D20 task resolution system can be summed up as follows:

 Skills (Fixed-Wing Pilot, Chemist, etc) are rated from 1-10.
 Attributes (Strength, Agility, etc) are also rated 1-10. Each
 skill has a Controlling Attribute that it is associated with.
 Tasks have a level of difficulty assigned (Easy, Average,
 Dfficult, Formidable, and Impossible). An Easy task is a
 D20 roll vs 4 times (Skill plus controlling attribute),
 Average = 2X, Difficult ^C= 1X, Formidable = 1/2, Impossible
 = 1/4. A 1 is an auto sucess, a 20 is an auto failure.

 If a character has no relevant skill, they can still try the
 task, but at one (or more) difficulty levels higher, versus the
 Controlling Attribute alone (doubles, halved, etc.). This makes
 having any skill at all very useful (it helps you avoid the extra
 level, and improves your target number).

 That\'s it in a nutshell.

 In any game I ran, I would excerise referee fiat, and declare that
 any character hit by a 120mm round is dead, over & out. However,
 since we are discussing "strictly by the book" refereeing (something
 I\'ve always disliked):

 The example was a good summation of the mechanics, but slightly
 unfair an _average_  character has only 30 damage points in the
 chest, not 60. This average character would be critically
 wounded by such a hit, and will go down like a stunned ox (if
 you use average values for the die roll, you ought to use
 average values for the hit capacity also).

 Now we come to the part that has disturbed a few people. An NPC hit
 in such a fashion is dead. A PC taking a critical hit in the
 chest automatically loses consciousness, and (again, following
 the letter of the rules) will die in 10 minutes unless he
 receives medical attention. "What medical attention can cure a
 120mm hole in the chest?", I hear people ask. Looking under
 "Recovery" we see that stabilizing a critical character is a
 task requiring Medical skill, and its level of difficulty
 depends on what medical equipment is available. The character
 dies if the task fails, or if the 10 minutes passes. (As I
 said, I prefer referee common-sense in a case like this...less
 die-rolling)

 This is a rather extreme example...the mechanics of most games look
 pretty silly at their extreme edges. This is the sort of thing that
 Space Gamer used to fill their Murphy\'s Rules page with,
 and they never lacked for subject matter...in anybody\'s games.

 Now, lets get to the implied question that\'s on everyone\'s minds, viz:

 "Are Characters too hard to kill in T2K?"
 (and, by extension, in TNE, since the same mechanics will be used)

 We have structured the T2K mechanics to err on the side of PC
 survival. We did this for a number of design reasons, the main
 one being the playtesters* really, REALLY didn\'t like it when
 their characters (generated with hours of loving care) got
 greased in the second or third firefight. In a game where
 combat occurs less often, a case could be made for more fragile
 characters than we have. Ours is not the only game that does this
 sort of thing, and we did it after careful consideration. The
 Quick Kill rule (which is detailed in the support material Rob
 has chosen not to buy) ameliorates the matter somewhat by making
 characters easier to do in under some circumstances.

 (* yes...we DID playtest Twilight)

 All things considered, we like the way the T2K2 combat system
 works, but we are considering a couple of minor tweaks for TNE.

 Chadwick and to Dave Nilsen.

Ah, but protium (hydrogen-1, the most common isotope) is useless for

hydrogen fusion requires deuterium and/or tritium.  Anyone got figures

        I have to take exception to this...are you using the first
edition?  In the second edition hits to the chest are determined by
(strength + constitution) x 3.  Since both str and con are
determined via a 1d10 roll, mean average would be 5.  5 + 5 x 3 =
30.  To receive a chest value of 60 would require the character to
have his or her strength and constitution equal to 10.  Even if the
person was wearing body armor, with two points absorbed per attack
the person is not going to survive long against hostile fire.

> but a head value of only 20

Head hits = con x 2.  con = 1d10.  Mean average heat hits = 10.

I see from the rest of your description you weren\'t overly fond of
this system.  Maybe it\'s because you\'ve been playing with the above
overpowered numbers :).  But I like the damage to each part of the
body.  I think a wound list is more appropriate than assigning
points however.  Improves the roleplaying a bit (and if you are at
all familiar with RoleMaster, the gore index skyrockets as well).

        Bringing it all back to traveller, I think the TNE should
use a simple point system like D&D or Star Frontiers.  The system
in use in Megatraveller is needlessly complex.  A wounds system in
TNE probably wouldn\'t be a good idea, simply because the massive
damage done by sf weapons, and the fact that this is not a combat
oriented game.

Steve J. White asks (some time ago);
:I just read your recent post to TML regarding the facts & figures file(s)
:you have on starports and such.  I\'d also be interested in anything you
:might have.  I\'m looking for GREAT detail for some worlds I\'ll soon be
:working on so starport detail is essential.  Thanks...

I\'m working on it.  I haven\'t forgotten, I just can\'t seem to find where
I put it.  (James and Mark know this litany from me...) :=)

Most of the stuff I have relates starport construction and classification
to examples of airports in the U.S. now.  Considering what has recently
been said about starport classification, I\'d like to add a TL8 checkpoint.
Most of this sounds awfully familiar to us Trav/MT buffs -- only this is
"real world" now...


The ICAO (the international governing body for aircraft and airspace) has
divided up airspace into six lettered classifications, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.
(Okay, I can\'t count.)

A is for all airspace over 18000 ft (yes altitdues are in feet, not meters)
  sounds to me like orbital starports fall into this area...

B is for the few HUGE airports that have massive commercial traffic,
  automated landing systems, multiple parallel runways, responsibility
  for area RADAR coverage, and stuff like that.  Examples are JFK, TOK,
  and HTW (Kennedy, Tokyo, and Heathrow).

  Sounds like a "good quality installation" to me.  :=)

C is for most other airports.  It includes all airports that have control
  towers.  Generally, in order to have a control tower, an airport will
  also have fuel.

D is for non-controlled fields.  You *generally* will only find these in
  the U.S. and in underdeveloped areas of the world.  (Makes sense to me.)

After that the classifications have to do with controlling aircraft that
are in the air.  Now Marc Miller might have been privy to this information
when he classified starports, but what the heck. :=)

Another thing to do for ideas about starports is to go down to your local
airport and hang out.  After you know these people, ask for old airport
maps that they\'re throwing out for updates -- the obsolete ones.  Air maps
get updated every six months.  These things have listings of services,
length and position of runways, etc.

Or you could go down to the boat supply shop and get a chart of your
favorite harbor...

I have Loren Wiseman\'s address at GEnie, and before anyone asks,
I am NOT volunteering it. He and I have exchanged a letter or two,
and in the stuff I have read from him I see little indication that he
is interested in joining the TML or in making his address widely
known.

This makes perfect sense to me, considering the scurrilous treatment
GDW has received at the hands of the TML in past months (of which I
have been an occasional participant). As Loren wrote me, the perception
of a "bunker mentality" at GDW was initially created by the fact that
GDW received TML postings very late, if at all, through the efforts
of TML members on GEnie who forwarded the text, a nontrivial task.
He did NOT go on to imply that a "bunker mentality" was encouraged
by the TML\'s predilection to stand by the GEnie gateway with a loaded
ARL, gleefully shooting off any appendage that poked through for a
moment. That was strictly my own inference, but I must confess that
it was a strong one.

There are several facets to the relationship between GDW and the TML
that should be kept in mind by everyone, INCLUDING me. One is that too
many scribes spoil the yoyaokhtef, and it can be and probably IS
counterproductive for GDW to dissect every thousand-line post on the
TML for veracity and playability, thereupon to immediately scrap the
work they\'re doing and start over. Loren may simply choose to avoid
the TML because he has too much other input to deal with, most of
which has far more direct bearing on his job. Another thing to keep in
mind is that the TML has in the past combined its members\' pride in
the fields in which they claim expertise with its enthusiasm for
improving Traveller, and salted this mix liberally with the "we\'re not
on GEnie and we can say whatever we want about GDW, so there"
mentality that GDW frankly despises.

I don\'t want to hear countercharges that GDW is being arrogant and
closeminded, and obviously refusing to listen to everyone\'s sage advice
out of foolish pride, or whatever. Let\'s face it, people: the majority
of the letters of comment on GDW\'s policies have been just plain MEAN.
Their factual content is, by comparison, unimportant! Game design is
in GDW\'s case a business of public relations and public service. As I
have lamented in the past, we of the TML are a small, SMALL fraction of
GDW\'s buyer base, and we create more mental anguish than the rest of them
put together. In the business of selling anything that is NOT a matter
of life and death to the buyer (get real, folx. Are YOU going to go into
insulin shock if TNE has a bad starship combat system?), it is always
better to be liked than to be right. The customer must be pleased, and
communicate this pleasure to the seller. Improvements can and should
be suggested, and I am NOT advocating that the TML scale back to the
pulled-teeth wimpiness of the GEnie round tables. BUT! Common, decent
courtesy to the people who provide us with the games we love should be
first and foremost. I don\'t claim innocence in these matters. Neither
should anyone else, before they access the bundle archives and reread
some of what they\'ve written.

GDW fields letters and phone calls every day from all over the country,
if not the world. They cry out for material to keep CHALLENGE on the
stands. But there is no corollary to that law that says they must tolerate
the slings and arrows of a small, thoroughly obnoxious group of buyers
- --and pay for the privilege!-- when there are less painful and more
profitable ways of doing business. It\'s not good business sense to do
otherwise. The customer is NOT always right when he\'s being abusive on
a consistent basis.

So don\'t be surprised if GDW doesn\'t make a big splash on the TML any
time soon. We make them angry, frustrated, and upset, and it\'s not
their duty to sit there and take it. It\'s not OUR duty to soften the
ideas behind our responses to their suggestions, only the manner in
which these ideas are presented. If I sound overly sensitive about this,
it\'s because of the one last factor in this issue that I haven\'t mentioned
yet: the glass wall you\'re staring at right now as you read these lines
of text. I\'ve broken through it, and have done for over ten years. It
has been my business to attach faces and voices and feelings and hopes
and everything else that makes us human to the lines of text that I read
on the TML and elsewhere. When I travel, I always meet net.people and
replace ASCII with flesh and blood in my mind. I will treasure my evening
with George Herbert and Catie Helm for years, as I do my many conversations
with Mark Cook over the phone. I envy my wife for having been able to sit
and talk to Hans Rancke-Madsen, whom I may NEVER meet, over tea. But there
is one other face and voice attached to ASCII on my screen, a face and
voice that most of you have never met and will never meet. Loren Wiseman.
He and I have chatted regularly for ten years now, and while he is not a
close friend, he is a pleasant acquaintance, and I for one would like to
be able to look him in the eye when I see him next, without having to be
ashamed for my conduct.

Think about it.

Scott asks:

Simple answer, there isn\'t one, there are to many variables involved. If
we assume average numbers for most things we still have Hit Location(1d10)
which you can\'t take an average on.

Before I continue let me make a few comments.  First I play TW2k, Merc:2k and
Dark Conspiracy quite a bit.  For the group I game with it\'s the system we\'ve
been using for a while.  What I consider the primary purpose/goal/need that a
system has to meet is that it is playable.  Realism is nice, but it always
comes in second.  If the game isn\'t playable then it doesn\'t matter how
realistic it is.

Back to mechanics, in the TW2k system a character can take a lot of damage
before dying, but knocking a character down, which puts him/her out of action
for at least the remainder of the round is easy.  Knocking a character out is
not that hard either.  I believe the hard to kill aspect of the system is
intentional. Face it, how many people enjoy having their character killed in
the first round of being ambushed.

In TW2k there are 3 levels of wounds: Slight, Serious and Critical.  Any damage
up to the first break point is Slight, up to double the break point is Serious
and above that is Critical.  (Dark Conspiracy adds another level which is half
the Slight level and is called Scratch.)

The standard effect of wounds is:
(Scratch): Lose next action (initiative).
Slight: -1 to your initiative.
Serious: Additional -2 to your initiative, if any action performed,
 character must roll under constitution on percentile dice
 or lose conciousness.
Critical: Effective 0 initiative, bleed to death in 20 rounds(10 min.)
  unless medical attention received.

Other effects:
If total damage absorbed during a phase is greater than your agility
attribute you are knocked down and lose any remaining actions for that
round.

Hit Location:  A d10 is rolled: 1 Head, 2 Chest, 3 Left Arm, 4 Right
Arm, 5-6 Abdomen, 7-8 Left Leg, 9-10 Right Leg.

Any time a character takes damage to the head there is a chance for
unconciousness, add a d6 to the damage taken and subtract the characters
constitution attribute, the result is the number of rounds the character
is unconcious for.

A serious wound to the head results in automatic unconciousness for the
specified number of rounds.

In order to regain conciousness, with any serious wound, requires a roll
equal to or less than the characters constitution attribute.  And, once
a character is concious, any physical action performed will cause the
character to again lose conciousness if a successful percentile con
check is not made.

Game turn note:  A round is 30 seconds and is broken into 6 phases of 5 seconds
each.  A character has an initiative from 1-6 and this tells how many
phases a character may perform an action in.

Now that I\'ve rambled on for a while, back to the original comment.

A .50 cal round, in TW2k does 8d8+8 damage, or 36 points of damage.

A character with average stats has the following hit point levels:

      Slight  SeriousCritical+
Head1020   21+
Chest3060   61+
Others2040   41+

So one .50 cal round will kill 10%, slight 10% and serious 80%.
I\'ll admit I think a .50 cal round to the chest should be more
than just a slight wound.  But also, just two weeks ago, while
running a Merc:2000 scenario a PC lost consciousness after being
hit by a .50 cal round and subsequently drowned when his boat sank.

>Since I don\'t have the game, could someone with the books look up the
>following for me?

>How many 120mm shells does it take to kill a Twilight 2000 character?

ONE.  Unless, of course, it was an illum round, :-)  Actually there is
nothing in the rules about a character being "hit" by a 120mm round
just blast effects if the round goes off near the character

If people want to talk more please feel free to email me.  There are a lot
of modifications we have made to the rules for "playability" purposes.

By the way, some of the most fun I\'ve had playing Dark Conspiracy has just
been creating new characters when others die or "retire" for other reasons.

Tonight\'s TML marks the first occasion that a regular employee of GDW
has posted a comment to the TML -- Loren Wiseman. It also offers up
commentary from Mark Cook and metlay on the topic of TML membership for
GDW.

I liked what I read in Metlay\'s message and believe he and I feel much
the same way. The biggest point worth repeating is that ALL THE MEMBERS
OF THE TML ARE REAL PEOPLE and deserve respect. Everyone has valid
motivations that others are not aware of. I\'ve done things that have
genuinely upset other TMLers without realizing it, most of us have.

I believe Loren is hear to listen to what we have to say, and respond to
it as best he can. The TML and it\'s self-proclaimed experts are in all
likelihood NOT a truly representative sample of the players that GDW
meets. In light of this, ask yourself whether it\'s fair to DEMAND things
of GDW. Suggest - yes, constructive complaint - yes, demand - you answer
this one.

My policy is that when there are "notables" on the TML, I let them lurk
until they come out and announce their own presence. However, I will not
hide knowledge that they are on the the TML if someone asks.

Welcome aboard, Loren. I hope that you, like all TMLers, are treated
with understanding and forethought. Enough editorializing from the
pulpit. Back to your regularly scheduled TML. Not a (forced by the
admin) kinder, gentler TML, nor a TML bargaining from a position of
force.

From GDW\'s Darrians Alien Module 8:
        Rebuilding the Confederation:
        ...
        The Sword Worlds: In -399 Solomani colonists arrived in
        the sector and settled on Gram.....
        ... When the original settlers of Gram arrived in the Spinward
        Marches, their survey of the various systems detected the
        Darrian worlds and their low-tech settlement. Because the
        Solomani wanted to create their own independent community
        of worlds, they avoided contact with the Darrians and instead
        selected the worlds of the Sword Worlds subsector.

This raises several points:

1) The Solomani settlers were actively trying to avoid contact. This explains
why they didn\'t want to settle in the core worlds but doesn\'t explain
why they went that way if that was their purpose? As mentioned earlier
rimwards is the shortest way to go somewhere where there is noone. However
since no one knew of the Zhodani existence till much later it was a valid
choice if you wanted to live far from anywhere (valid but not necessarily
sensible).

2) The knew of the existence of Darrians and perhaps even knew the fact
that the Darrians had once been more technologically sophisticated.

3) It implies a substantial and well organised effort in that they were
searching for a particular set of conditions. They probably had growth in
mind before they settled considering the easy J-1 accessibility of all worlds.

About crossing the Reft...
To me the question that is raised is how and why? If they crossed the
Reft they did it for a specific reason i.e. they knew exactly where they
wanted to go and then took the "shortest" path. I don\'t know if it is
even viable to do it with J-2 maybe J-3 technology. Remember the Reft
was only crossed in 1090 by a specialised Scout ship and that was done
in Corridor. If they did it I can see why it took them 20 years....but I
can also see them changing their minds from frustration and skimming the
spinward edge of Vland into Corridor-Deneb-Marches.

About SW being from Trojan reach.....
I believe there is reference somewhere that indicates that Trojan Reaches
was settled by Third Imperium via a route from Deneb sector. There is
sufficient info elsewhere that SW did leave Terra dominated territory if
not Terra itself. 20 years isn\'t really sufficient for the SW to reach
Trojan Reach and then split up to the degree that you imply.

I think it is

And they might have been isolationist/racist enough not to settle in a world
that was pre-populated..... Any takers on what they might have done to get
so isolationist? It seems that the reasons might still be applicable to
current SW as they are still have an isolationist/antogonistic attitude.

That\'s understandable, and would explain why they seem intent on an alliance
with the Zhodani and are so focused on disrupting the Imperium especially
considering their small size and low tech. However one would think that
after the Solomani Rim War they would have slackened up on annoying the
Imperium.

Still the main question now seems to be what they did back then to be exiled?

Lastly from a lack of response can I presume that no one knows when
the Solomani "Gene War" occured.....??

Re: Twilight System hits rules

The "Invincible characters" problem was fixed in
the D20 rules suppliment; there\'s a new rule that
effectively makes direct or near hits by explosive or
antitank rounds lethal to even armoured humans.

This _is_ the rules version that they hope to use for TNE, so that would seem
to be the operating condition to plan for.  People will still die if they
stand in front of tanks 8-)

    You\'re out of luck on what you want me to edit or don\'t edit. If I had
the time to waste checking for that it might be okay, but the only thing
I had time to waste on it was some reformatting and deleting the stories
and adventures out for the people I was forwarding it too (which are people
interested in what the TML had to say and do, but didn\'t have the access
to Internet to do so themselves, therefore they subscribed through me).
    Anyway now GDW has it\'s own access as do the other people if they
want it directly (and GDW does), I will no longer be forwarding the
TML to anybody using this address since it is not permitted.
    In any case I don\'t really consider the TML private, anymore than
a subscription to a magazine is private, or joining a SIG.
    Therefore if you have anything to say that you don\'t want to tell
GDW, you might consider private Email (though legally speaking, I\'m
not sure Internet Email would be considered private by a court of law
at this time).

EVERYBODY ELSE,
    GDW, and several other parties where interested in getting the TML
feed for various reasons. In GDW\'s case it gave them access to what they
hoped might be useful consumer input (and to a certain extent it did).
    Despite what people think or decide to believe. I do believe that
GDW has TNE\'s best interests at heart, and it does look like they\'ll be
opening up playtesting to other people, and hopefully here on the TML
as well. Otherwise there best course would be to just let the game die
and not bother with putting up with the heat they are, nor worry about
the competition taking over the position left open by the failure
of MT.
    Everybody already knows what a kludge MT was, so what\'s the sense
in repeating that all the time? (I think by now even the densest person
would get that point). Even Joe Fugate got to admitting what a
mistake it was.
    Admittedly some of the changes in TNE are going to upset a lot
of old traveller players (me included), offhand I don\'t really see
a way around it, but than I agree that Traveller needs some major
updating to bring it up to date with modern RPGing, ease of use, and
technology (AI, cybertech, nanotech as examples).
    As for switching to the T2K system, well, I\'m certainly going
to miss those d6. But I can understand the need to keep things
simple, and using just one system inhouse is easier than trying to
remember how to play several different RPG\'s. Just so long as I don\'t
see characters living through bazooka hits and such.
    At the moment my main concerns are how open the playtesting will
be, and hoping GDW doesn\'t rush the product out before the bugs are
mostly removed at least (I\'m more tired of others of seeing errata/updates
put out because the product was rushed out to meet some deadline).

    Anyway, a little chaos in one\'s life keeps those arteries from hardening
up. And experienced GM\'s know how to change the rules to please themselves
and their players (that includes things like the Virus and other unpleasant
facts, like possibly Stutterwarp, which I can accept as an option/variant,
but not as an official part of TNE).

P.S. And anybody feeling intimidated by GDW listening in can have fun.
If you can\'t take the heat in return, maybe you shouldn\'t speak up in
public. \'Nough said.
P.P.S. As for the discussion on GDW suing Scott, they where talking about
doing so for libel, not copyright infringement. And GDW has been pretty
good about allowing others to use their universe, especially when there
permission is asked.

One brief question for GDW, if you don\'t mind my asking--what sort of

I seem to remember this as well.  It was first established either in an
early issue of the Journal, or an early issue of the Digest.  I will
take a look and see if I can find the reference (or maybe Metlay
knows).

It seems to me that the GURPS descriptions are a little more specific,
and the idea of determining the planet\'s population (and presumably
other characteristics) *BEFORE* deciding what type of port it has is
overall a good one.

I would like to propose a starport classification system that uses three
values: the port type (the current starport type letter), a traffic
digit (a single digit for the volume of traffic), and a
facilities digit (a single digit for the quantity and
variety of services available).  In other words, a starport rating might
look like "A-75"; perhaps it could be included in the UPP at the end,
after the population multiplier, asteroid belts, and gas giants, like:
  FOOBAR AXXXXXX-F NS Hi In 923-97

The following is a draft port generation and interpretation guide.
Since I haven\'t had time to play-test it to any significant degree (it
was created during the last few days), I would appreciate any
suggestions, especially with respect to DMs and interpretations.

Generation Procedure
Traffic Code: Roll 2d6-10 and apply the following DMs:
  Population: Lo=-2 Hi=+2
  Starports: X=-4 E=-2 D=+0 C=+2 B=+4 A=+6
  Trade Classifications: Po=-4 Ni=-3 Ba=-2 Fl=-1 Ic=+0 Wa=+0
                         Va=+1 De=+1 Na=+1 As=+2 Ag=+3 Ri=+3 In=+4
  Trade Partners: +1 per world within Jump-1 (+2 if starport A or B)
                  +1 if subsector or local capital
                  +1 if on X-Boat or designated trade route
                  -2 if there are no worlds within Jump-2
  Prosperity: Referee-assigned DM based on local conditions or
              regional trade factors; from -4 to +4 suggested.
  If the result is less than zero, assign a code of X; results greater
  than F (15) should be reduced to F.
Facilities Code: Roll 2d6-10 and apply the following DMs:
  Traffic Code: apply the full traffic code as a DM (treat X as -1).
  Bases: +2 if Naval or Scout base is present
  Local Technology: -4 if local TL is Pre-Industrial (TL0-3)
                    -2 if local TL is Industrial (TL4-5)
                    +0 if local TL is Pre-Stellar (TL6-8)
                    +1 if local TL is Early Stellar (TL9-A)
                    +2 if local TL is Average Stellar (TLB-D)
                    +3 if local TL is High Stellar (TLE-G)
                    +4 if local TL is Extreme Stellar (TLH+)
  If the result is less than zero, assign a code of X; results greater
  than F (15) should be reduced to F.

Explanation of Codes
  Traffic Code
    X = No traffic (except as referee-generated event)
    0 = Isolated; very little traffic
    1, 2, 3 = Backwater; little traffic
    4, 5, 6 = Low traffic volume
    7, 8, 9 = Average traffic volume
    A, B, C = High traffic volume
    D, E = Major Trade Center; very high traffic
    F = Extremely high traffic; one of the busiest systems in space.
  Facilities Code
    X = Abandonded, converted to other purpose, or destroyed
    0 = Minimum possible facility to meet starport type classification
    1, 2, 3 = Cramped, too small to support current use
    4, 5, 6 = Small but adequate
    7, 8, 9 = Average
    A, B, C = Large
    D, E = Extensive; plenty of room and able to do nearly anything
    F = Comprehensive; any possible requirement can be met

Examples:
  A-XX = Class A port: capable of constructing starports
         Traffic level X: No Traffic
         Facilities X: No Facilities
         This port is probably under siege, embargo, or interdiction.
         The port facilities have been destroyed, and no traffic is
         going in or out.
  C-FF = Class C port: average facility, capable of reasonable repairs
         Traffic Level F: Extremely high
         Facilities Code F: Comprehensive.
         A very busy, important port; local facilities are capable of
         nearly anything short of an annual overhaul or actual new
         construction.  Port probably remains class C due to lack of
         local resources to construct hulls and drives (possibly due to
         low TL or non-technical economy).
  A-30 = Backwater facility that barely meets standards of a class A
         port.  Perhaps the facilities were constructed by the local
         government in a (failed) attempt to stimulate trade.  One
         yard is present, and construction is possible, but slow.  No
         standard designs are available.
  B-A3 = System has high traffic but cramped facilities.  Probably
         traffic growth has outstripped the starport\'s ability to
         expand.  Expect delays everywhere; especially for docking
         space and ship overhauls.  Probably charges more than the
         standard rate for docking fees.

Other uses:
  Use the Traffic or Facilities code just like attributes in task rolls
  (divide by 5 and drop fractions).  Finding a shipyard willing and able
  to repair battle damage might be Routine(Facilities), while finding
  passage on a ship going to the proper destination might be
  Difficult(Traffic), if it is an unpopular destination.

Design Notes:
  The system designed generally on the basis of "what feels right".  I
  wanted better starports to have generally more traffic, but not
  always.  Since most traders have relatively low jump performance,
  having a lot of nearby worlds to trade with would also help increase
  the trade level.  The DMs for trade classifications were based on the
  MegaTraveller trade matrix; worlds with more potential intersections
  on the Cargo Price Modifiers chart have higher DMs.  I figured that
  the facilities would generally follow the traffic volume.  Since
  significant imported technology is required at lower TLs, the
  are generally smaller; likewise, worlds with Scout or Navy bases
  probably have military contractors that are not adverse to doing
  work for the civillian sector.  Again let me stress that this is a
  new thing, and I haven\'t properly run it through the wringer yet;
  please let me know if you seen any errors.

OK, you asked for it.  Much of it is Classic Traveller ship designs and
deckplans, along with lots of other stuff filed away in my gaming files.
I\'ll start digging and see what I can find.

  The short version:
  You roll one d6 for each shot fired on full auto and each \'6\' rolled is a hit.

  The longer version:
  Each weapon capable of automatic fire fires in burst of 3 5 10 or 50/60/100
rounds when it doesn\'t fire semi-auto. Up to five such burst can be fired in
a phase. A human can only target up to 3 targets per phase, and each burst has
a specific target (although as I interpret it, an 8*8 area can be a target
if somebody tries to \'recon by fire\').
  The practical number of bursts for most weapons is limited by the strenght
of the firer and the burst fire recoil rating of the weapon. If the sum of the
recoil of all burst in a phase is greater than the strengh, the number of
dice, originally equal to the number of rounds, except for the burst of more
than 10 round, is reduced by the difference.
  As the range increases the number of dice is further reduced by a certain
number per burst per range band beyond short.

  When you know how many dice to roll you roll them and each \'6\' is a hit.
Half if the dice (round down) that miss in each burst is rolled again and
any \'6\' rolled is a hit on a secondary target within 4m left and right of the
target and in the same range band. Any dice that miss this time are rolled
again and any \'6\' is a potential hit that will hit any target that tries to
move or act in the line of fire for the rest of the phase and upto the time
the firer is allowed to fire again in the next phase.

  Autofire is notoriously tough to model, and I generally like this model.
The only big beef I have with it is that the skill of the firer doesn\'t come
in at all, but Lester Smith mentioned during the one of the seminars at Origins/
Gencon that they had some ideas of making skill figure in.

  I think that the Gene War only was mentioned in the Referees section of
DGP\'s Solomani&Aslan book. It was absent from the timeline in the same book.
It is possible that the idea came from somebody, perhaps on DGP or HIWG, but
that the info on when it happened was edited out/never included, In that case
*somebody* knows, but I have no idea who.

Where did you get the impression that you needed deuterium or tritium to
fuse?  The sun certainly uses a protium-protium cycle, and it certainly
should be possible to develop a controlled p-p cycle within a few
thousand years...

And the usage level you are looking at is about 30 times as high as even
MY wildest imaginings as to the space traffic on Terra.  At the rate I
have estimated for Terra, you would lower the ocean level by a meter in
only 7900-odd years.  BUT, part of that hydrogen will find its way back
into Terra\'s oceans, since presumably the waste hydrogen from the power
plants is dumped out as the ship goes, and anything discarded in
atmosphere will probably combine with atmospheric oxygen and fall like
rain.

And how should we communicate pleasure we don\'t feel?  Unless GDW writes

I have acquired, through one means or another, almost every RPG GDW put
out.  Entirely too many of them languish in a closet because GDW stopped
support of them. Available players tend to dry up when the company stops
supporting a game, alas!  GDW ought to keep in mind that common courtesy
should also be due the people who buy their products, and (indirectly)
pay their bills.

All this is leading to the point that if they produce products like
"Shattered Ships of the Fighting Imperium" (which Chadwick  admitted had
not been editted properly (what do they do over there, if they don\'t
edit their products?)), then they deserve no more (in fact, a lot less)
respect than they have been getting.

friendships/acquaintances/relationships have historically been

wants us to treat GDW like "people", then he should try posting

How and why?  1090?  In my TCS game, there are at least two ships, one
TL-10, one TL-12, that are theoretically capable of crossing the Rift.
Both can cross eight parsecs of empty space, and one (the TL10 one),
can, with sufficient drop tanks, cross 21 parsecs without refueling.  So
it certainly is possible to build ships that can, and has been since the
Ziru Sirka.

If they were racists, they probably would have settled somewhere with
natives to feel superoir to/exterminate.  Makes you feel more macho, I
guess.  If they were isolationist, they should have settled well away
from Darrian.  Personally, I think the knowledge of Darrian should be
excised from the History of the Sword Worlds.  It is difficult to
reconcile with everything else.  Perhaps the "Official History" says
they knew of the Darrians, but they were really caught flat-footed when
they discovered their next-door neighbors (whom they didn\'t really
want), and changed history to imply that they had planned it that way
all along.  This would make a good line to feed their people ("Yes, we
knew about them before we chose Gram, but we settled here anyway.  We\'ll
need a stong enemy to test us, to keep us strong, etc....")

BTW, Cynthia and I will be offline for several days while we move into
our newly bought house.  Perhaps through Friday.  So anyone who expects

 ...on the other hand, why would you want to?  It shouldn\'t be THAT difficult
to separate protium and deuterium, and if I remember my nuclear fizziks right,
the d-d reaction is much more energetic.

But that would be a rain almost inevitably contaminated with tritium and other
fairly unpleasant fusion byproducts. *I* wouldn\'t want any starship emptying
its reactor waste over *MY* head. (Am I remembering right?  Tritium does
have a half-life of eleven years or so, doesn\'t it? And that would put it
squarely in the medium-duration really-nasty-to-large-lifeforms class.
(The really energetic short half-life stuff disappears too fast to be a
real problem, and the really long-lived stuff is too weakly radioactive,
but the medium-life stuff will decay just fast enough to deliver its entire
dosage in the life of one big animal.)  I\'ll check the CRC later if no one
beats me to it.)

Anyway, it would seem much preferable to refine the hydrogen first, and
sell the ships just the deuterium that they\'d want, keeping the hydrogen for
your seawater--and for that matter, burning hydrogen to get water is an
excellent clean source of chemical energy for cars and such.

Are fusion reactors supposed somehow to take in a small amount of hydrogen,
fuse it for a while, and then spit it out, taking in another bite to refresh
itself?  Has anyone worked out any of the numbers here--is this a sensible
model? (I\'m here out of a general interest in sf role-playing; I don\'t have
Traveller and am fuzzy on some of the details like this.)

Indeed, they WERE talking about suing Scott for libel, which IMHO is a

The one I liked was when we were handed a set of orders and we started
commenting on them in front of the GM (ie orderer) who just sat there
taking notes of our attitude.  Later, we were "evaluated" by intelligence
officers based on what we had complained about.  There\'s nothing
more paranoid than a paranoid security officer.  Boy, they could dig
up things you thought you had well and trully forgotten.

Gee, your guys are either very patriotic or thy\'re shit scared of their
boss.

I remember a discussion long ago (well bits of it) about why the US never
had any good spies and always seemed to have big leaks.  Of course the UK
are a separate issue, most of their agents were working full time for
everybody else.

It seems that the end result was that if you pay your top-notch agent
$40K a year and then expect him/her to pay informants $200K for a snipet
of information then you would have to be an idiot to expect them to NOT
cash in by selling some US secrets to the oposition.

If you give the $200K to your agent and say "get the information" then
they will be more likely to come home with the goods (with a profit to
themselves) and be very expensive to win over to the other side.

It does sound unrealistic.  I\'ve found this in almost any game system
where they try to cover everything from fist blows to vehicle mounted
fusion weapons.  I have found the LIGHT/SERIOUS/CRITICAL wound
classifications to be easier to accept where the category of wound
has varying meanings depending upon where you get hit.  A light wound
to the head is far more incapacitating than a light wound to an arm etc.

BTW  I have heard of a LONG BOW firing an arrow at short range though
     half inch of plate armour.  Armour which a police revolver did
     not penetrate.  Police were there for the exhibition and I believe
     that the arrow used was wood with a reinforced metal tip.


REFUELing

Thanks to the few who have replied to this question but I still don\'t have
a useful answer.

So far I\'ve got

   - don\'t worry about it, it won\'t cause any problems for several thousand
     years,

   - panic now because you\'re losing 2cm a year (2cm over a 10 year period
     would start to get me worried), and

   - panic yesterday because you\'re losing 9+cm per year.

If you have to process XX tons of water to get 1 ton of fuel then you must
be processing a lot of water.  When does this activity start to impact the
planet?  When do the GREENies and other radical groups start complaining
about the environment and the destruction of water life etc etc etc and

On the subject of fusion, I am no expert.  However, I once ran through
the calculations during our discussions.  At least on Earth, deuterium
is about .015 percent of all hydrogen.  If you figure a fuel flow rate
of 3 liters of hydrogen per hour (see MT Ref\'s Manual for choice of
number), and had a 100% efficient d-d fusion reaction with no other
reactions, you could derive a maximum of 5MW from that reactor (compared
to the 6MW that can be gotten from a 14kl+ TL9-12 fusion reactor using
3 liters of hydrogen per hour per kl).  Ergo, you either have deuterium
enrichment, or protium reactions.  It doesn\'t take a terribly efficient
protium reaction (when added to d-d with a higher efficiency level) to
get the sort of power output we are told we get from a fusion plant in
MegaTraveller.

One suggestion is to xerox or retype the world data for the subsector
you are adventuring in.  Put the copy in your campaign notebook and
update the world UPPs as the players encounter them.  This way you can
fudge the values of just about anything and remain consistent when the
players return to the world at some point in the future.

>[starport ratings and traffic levels]

One problem with quantifing the traffic levels in aggregate tons a year
is the problem of deciding what the trade level should be.  By this I
mean that everyone\'s concept of how much interstellar traffic there
actually *IS* in the Imperium varies greatly.  Heck, I\'m not even
self-consistent in my own view.

At one end of the spectrum is the "luxury trade" concept.  This is that
interstellar trade is a relatively rare and expensive thing, and that even
the busiest ports have at most a few dozen ships in port at once.  This
point of view seems implicit in many of the earliest Traveller
materials.  Trade therefore makes up a very little part of the Gross
Imperial Product, and most worlds are almost entirely self-sufficient.

The other end of the extreme is where the Imperium is one large
interstellar economy; with most worlds dependent on interstellar imports
or exports to maintain their technology and standard of living. Such a
model calls for hundreds or thousands of ships in port at even
moderately busy systems.  This point of view is implicit in almost
anything written for MegaTraveller.

I tend to suspect that the latter case is probably more accurate, but I
would hate to create a rating system that dictated a level of trade to a
referee that was comfortable with something else.

This is why I used two numbers in my rating system.  The traffic rating
indicates the aggregate tonnage of shipping (in a vague sort of way),
while the facilities code shows what the landing pads, yards, and repair
shops are capable of (a code A-?0 world might find constructing a
scoutship to be a challenge, while a A-?F world would be quite capable
of million-ton behemoths).

Using the large-scale trade assumptions, a rough guide to my system
would go something like:

Trade Volume (with Cynthia\'s interpretation of Scott\'s ragings):
  F = a billion aggregate tons or more (more than "H")
  D, E = over a hundred million aggregate tons ("H")
  A, B, C = over ten million aggregate tons ("M")
  7, 8, 9 = over a million aggregate tons (high "L")
  4, 5, 6 = over a hundred thousand aggregate tons (Low "L")
  1, 2, 3 = over ten thousand aggregate tons (high "O")
  0 = at least a thousand aggregate tons (low "O")
  Z = less than a thousand aggregate tons ("Z")

I tend to hand-wave on this one.  Most players are satisfied with my
explanation of "Partially-collapsed matter" and don\'t ask for details.
You are right, though: degenerate matter ("neutronium" to my players)
and meson atoms are probably way-higher than TL-15.

I think you\'ve got a lot of gall to preach to the rest of us after some of your
episodes on TML.  I resent being preached at.

I try to be tolerant and civil to all the people on TML, and I think everyone
should do likewise in general.  However, the tone of the message is usually set
by the preceeding traffic.  When someone at GDW threatens to sue someone on
TML, the following traffic is likely to be a bit harsh.

However, when I see something I don\'t understand or think is wrong in some of
GDW\'s published information, I\'m going to say so, and I hope that everyone will
continue to do so.

I don\'t "demand" that GDW do modify *anything* for my sake, or even reply to me
personally for some bit of trivia I might bring up.

I don\'t know that I\'ve ever heard anyone actually *demand* that GDW do things
*their* way.

Most reactions to occasional game idiocies are on the tone of \'this is stupid!
is there something I\'m overlooking, or is there a better way to play this?\'.

Some idiocies have provoked people swearing off TNE and GDW, and playing the
classic or private rules in the future; that is certainly a valid choice for
them.

The more prolific & imaginative members of TML would like to be more of a
resource for GDW, and have them pay a bit more attention to TML.  However,
recent experience shows that TML is not organized enough to carry out sizable
projects.

It might be nice if GDW paid a bit more attention to TML, but that\'s up to GDW.

It also might be nice if GDW had some stated policy regarding Traveller forums
so that we would know what to expect of any interaction between TML and GDW.
What would GDW like to get from TML?  My belief in the past has been that with
occasional exceptions GDW doesn\'t care about TML.

In any case, I hope that TML continues as it has in the past; a interesting and
fun place to talk about Traveller.  GDW can take it or leave it.  If GDW really
does want to cooperate with TML we\'re going to need a lot better communication
on both sides then we\'ve had in the past.

    'body' => 'Hey folx,

To Mr. Wiseman & GDW welcome.

About updating Trav:
Well, the feel for the game comes from the era in which it was written.
Take a look at the old Tech level advancement charts.  The original
appeared in \'77 (25 Years ago), and to be frank, it shows.  IMO, the
feel for the game comes from it\'s view of technology.  ie. Computers
are less important than human (player) input.  Aiming and firing a gun
is not much less difficult at TL 15 than it is at TL 4.  The gun just
has more hitting power.  Maybe these things are not such great ideas
in now that we\'ve had more and more influence from computers than we
did in \'77.  Maybe these things gotta change.

The old TL chart (Book 3:  p14-15  :-)  Sez:  Artificial Intelligence
is TL 17.  BOO!!!  So much of Science Fiction (especially right now)
has A.I. much more common than that.  There\'s only ONE planet in the
Entire Trav/MegaTrav universe that has Artificial Intelligent Robots,
(other than the Cymbiot chips) and they\'re in a Red Zone.

Ok, now maybe the \'Virus\' will change all that.  We have a retroactive
convention (or as Metlay sez \'retcon\') saying that the chips have been
used all around the Trav universe as transponders.  Well, to me and
several others, it sounds a bit silly that that would be their Only use.
Seems ta me that they would get used EVERYWHERE if they were available.
And their self reproducing capabilities make them awfully cheap.

Frankly, I would not mind seeing a \'retcon\' that artificial intelligent
robots are a lot more common in Trav than they have been seen to be
previously.  After all, we have all the stuff from book 8 onward saying
that robots are ALL OVER the Imperium and its surroundings.  We see that
At tech level 10, the maximum intelligence of a robot brain is average
human intelligence (7)  So why is it such a strain that A.I. robots have
been around since the beginning, but just aren\'t very important?

Robots are quite important in Science Fiction.  Take a look at what is
out there.  Robots are popular.  Star Wars --> Terminator etc. etc.
Trav is a bit out of step with more popular stuff by making the robots
so rare.  Why not use the cymballine chips & descendants in LOTS of
things OTHER than just the transponders.  After all there are a LOT of
good applications for them.  When handed a chip like that, AI & all,
one of the LAST applications I would have in mind would be a
transponder.

I wouldn\'t mind if TNE used A.I. much more extensively.  It would broaden
the base appeal of the game, and if done carefully, wouldn\'t change it
too much.  Let\'s face it.  We don\'t want EVERYTHING to be AI.  I don\'t
want MY characters to be less intelligent than the smart sights of their
guns.  I wanna have the Character do the thinking, not his gun.  (Many
games/science fiction genres have a habit of letting the guns do all the
planning/thinking/talking, but I don\'t think Anyone out there wants Trav
to change into just a shootemup.  :-P)

I don\'t like the idea of having a player hand over the facts to a
computer & have the computer come up with the solution.  Trav is
not like that.  Trav is a \'hands-on\' game.  But there is still a
good deal of room for AI.

What other things have become popular in Science Fiction that
should be incorporated to make Trav sell?

Cyborgs?  Sure!  Why not?  One of the things I like about Trav is it is
pretty versatile.  The incusion of cyborg rules won\'t change the flavor
of the game unless it becomes the selling point of the game.  As it is
NOT the flavor of the game, it Won\'t change anything we don\'t want.
But cyborgs are popular & all the cyber punk stuff is selling, so put it
in!

Neural feeds?  Cyberspace?  I don\'t know enough about it to comment, but
I don\'t think it\'s inclusion will change trav much.  It isn\'t the Selling
point of the game, so it won\'t change it.  There is some rudimentary
stuff on neural connections in Trav, but it could use some fleshing out.

Nano-technology?  Well, that\'s tricky.  As Bertil pointed out, if you\'ve
got Nano-tech, why bother walking around in Battle Dress with a fusion
gun when you can just send a cloud of nanotech thingies out to do all
that nasty fighting for you?  But, if it is done carefully, and limited
enough, I think it could be included without changing the feel of the game.

Matter transportation?  Urf.  I don\'t like it.  But if it were sufficiently
limited, it MIGHT be doable.  If handled like it is in some of Niven\'s
stories, it could be done:  designated booths as transmitter & reciever.
NOT like Star Trek.  A trasporter like Star Trek\'s would be out of control.
If the players got a hold of one it would be utterly rediculous.  And any
opponant with one would be unstoppable.

Matter manipulation/replication?  Just don\'t.  It would be worse than
a trasporter by a longshot.

Anti-matter?  Why not?  It\'s not that much more powerful than any other
weapon in Trav.  Also, we\'re much closer to having anti-matter stuff now
than we are to having artificial grav.  To those who say that the players
could destroy an entire planet with anti-matter, I gotta point out that
a crew in a scoutship could destroy an entire planet with a cargo hold of
pebbles.  (Accelerate to 1/10 speed of light {18 days @ 2G\'s} and drop
the rocks on the planet.  @ speeds like that, a 10 gram pebble has the
kinetic energy equivalent of a 1 kiloton atomic bomb.)

Ok, those are just some of the things Trav is light on that might
work for TNE.  I\'ve probably left out a bunch.  What do you all think?
And remember, Trav is a TL 7 game after all.  It needs an update:  it
had Air/Rafts & other grav transportation listed as tech level 8.
(Not to mention fusion...  laser carbines...  interplanetary spacecraft...)

Somebody asked about how much damage laser carbines are
gonna do under the Twilight 2000 rules.  This got me to
thinking about the basic treatment of laser weapons in Trav.

Lasers are not treated very well.  They are treated
essentually as a gun without recoil.  Now to quote our
fave cantakerous physicist:  "A laser is not a gun without
recoil.  It is a flashlight that kills!"  Aiming a laser
weapon will be pathetically easy.  Point it at em.  Keep
the beam on the target.  I once played a little game with
some trav friends of mine.  We had a Class II Helium Neon
laser 0.095mw.  Your basic classroom demonstrator laser
about as powerful as a laser pointer.  We taped it up to
a pair of binoculars so you could see the beam at a about
a hundred yards.  Next we sent someone (me) down to be the
target.  (Class II lasers will not hurt you unless you
stare into the beam).

Now, I can assure you, at a hundred yards, I\'m a small
target.  Also most of you can figure out from my writing
that I\'m pretty hyper and I\'ll assure you I can move/evade
when I want to.  I could not keep that beam off of me.
Even with that clumsy binocular/laser arrangement I just
could not evade that beam without good cover.

Hitting a target with a laser weapon will be VERY easy.

Furthermore, hitting an unarmored target will be a piece of
cake.  Speaking as (probably) the only person on the TML who\'s
actually been wounded by a laser (Argon Ion Class IIIb to the
retinae)  Lemme tell you it would be VERY easy to incapacitate
a person with a laser weapon.  Aim for the eyes.  Now, you don\'t
need all that much power to blind someone.  A laser that can
cut through 7mm of steel as the early laser weapons are supposed
to could easily put a lens on to expand the beam and still have
enough power to blind.  Sure you don\'t get penetrating power,
but now your beam quite large large.  It would be exactly like
pointing a flashlight at someone.  In a combat situation,
blinding someone is just as effective as killing them.

It would obviously depend a lot on where and how the refining is done. Assuming
it\'s done in open water and with enough care not to contaminate the water
dumped out of the system, I wouldn\'t expect it to be a problem except in an
already badly weakened ecosystem.

You seem to have a fair idea: the radicals get pissed on principle, as soon
as they notice; responsible environmentalists as soon as it\'s measureable;
and your average sleepwalking citizens when they see their beaches receding.

I think you missed the whole point of the argument. The problem isn\'t if
its possible, the problem is whether its VIABLE. What is the ratio of
useful cargo to fuel for such vessels? If you are transporting more than
10 people what is its size? If the original SWs had access to a very large
volume tonnage then they could have run over just about any opposition at
that time or atleast taken the less risky route. If they were exiled then
would the Terrans have let them go with oh a couple of hundred million tons
worth of shipping in the assumption that most of it would be used for fuel.

If on the other hand they built such ships then they were purpose built for
crossing the Great Rift.

That implies that the SW knew EXACTLY where they wanted to go. Which brings
us back to the original question of: Why settle where they did? Still
doesn\'t explain why it took them 20 years. If they
took the short-cut then they should have gotten there sooner not later by
14 years. As far as settling in the Trojan Reach goes, I would have thought
that they would stick around there for a few more years, IF they were trying
to settle, before running another half a sector into the Marches. One other
thing if your vessels have Riftspanning ability why cross the unknown Rift,
just skip from one backward world to another skimming fuel. No problem with
governments and its safer than the Rift i.e you can always find worlds that
can supply fuel AND food.

The other problem is that as my reference to crossing of Reft and the
original Aslan book reveals that the region was not mapped till recently.
While it may have been possible to cross the Rift, it wasn\'t done until
recently (as far as we know). Now if the SW crossed the Great Rift they
probably did so w/out the benefit of any accurate maps. This is probably
true in any case due to the state of interstellar commerce. This could
explain why they wandered around for about 20 years. However sanity would
suggest that after the first 5 years of jumping into deep space they would
have changed their minds and taken a route which allows them to use less
fuel.


>If they were racists, they probably would have settled somewhere with
>natives to feel superoir to/exterminate.

Maybe they were out to show how to build utopia. They preferred no
confusing interference from smarty natives. Otherwise all the Klansmen
would have settled in ghettos. And the suburbs would be free of all racism.....

>If they were isolationist, they should have settled well away
>from Darrian.

Too tired of travelling and possible that they did not think that the
Darrians would recover anytime soon. They were right in that regard
mostly. They did nothing to help them that\'s for sure.

>Personally, I think the knowledge of Darrian should be
>excised from the History of the Sword Worlds.  It is difficult to
>reconcile with everything else.

I think it becomes worse if u assume that they did not know of Darrians.
Then u have a group of people who has travelled for 20 years
scouting for the best place to settle and they never noticed the Darrians
when they finally decide to settle! Its more likely that they thought
that the Darrians were too low-tech to be a threat and the unoccupied
SW subsector too good. There is no indication that any of the civil wars
made the SW lose the tech for jumps. They would have NOTED the Darrians
existence whether they really NOTICED or CARED TO NOTICE them is an
entirely different matter. I think its more likely that they underestimated
them.


>Perhaps the "Official History" says
>they knew of the Darrians, but they were really caught flat-footed when
>they discovered their next-door neighbors (whom they didn\'t really

>all along.  This would make a good line to feed their people ("Yes, we
>knew about them before we chose Gram, but we settled here anyway.  We\'ll
>need a stong enemy to test us, to keep us strong, etc....")

This would be fine if we knew of what the SWs taught as history. Its
not the SW that claim to have contacted the Darrians, its Darrians who
claim to have been contacted. The source of info is the Darrians Alien
Module. Info on SW is rather scanty as far as pre-Imperial history goes as
you might have guessed.

    'index' => 'aj346',
    'body' => 'Howdy,

A couple of things in my private e-mail brought up cockpit design
again.  So, I just thought I\'d post my updated version about
cockpit design.  I\'ve changed a few things since you all saw it
last.

Question:  Just how do the different alien races design their
control panels.  We kinda take it for granted that they are
different, but just how different are they?  For simplicity\'s
sake I just took a look at pilot stations.

I\'m assuming that a grav vehicle\'s throttle will basically be
similar to a helicopter\'s collective control.  While the attitude
control of grav vehicle and helicopters will be very similar as
both perform the same operations.  No, there is no steering wheel
in an air/raft!

SOLOMANI (start off simple right?)
     Solomani and most Imperial flight controls generally consist
of stick, throttle, and rudder pedals.  The stick is usually
mounted in the center of the console, but is sometimes on the left
side, while the right hand generally controls the throttle.  This
allows the co-pilot or navigator (generally seated on the right) to
be able to reach the throttle.  If the pilot were incapacitated,
the co-pilot can easily take control.  If the stick is on the left
side, it and the throttle are mounted in the arms of the
acceleration couch.  This allows the pilot to rest his arms on the
chair.  This can be nice when you don\'t have inertial compensators
working.
     On most ships, especially fighters, all combat and
communication functions are mounted on the stick and throttle.
This allows a pilot to conduct all combat operations without having
to move his hands to different controls.  This design philosophy is
known as HOTAS.  (Hands On Throttle And Stick)
     Darrians tend to use Solomani control design philosophy,
though with a greater emphasis on center mounted sticks.  This is
because of the high proportion of ambidextrousness and left
handedness in Darrian gene pools.

VILANI
     Vilani controls are a bit more automated.  Auto pilots tend
to be a bit more sophisticated (and are heavily relied on)  The
control lay out is on the clumsy side.  Engineers opted for a
single design to ease training of pilots and to avoid their
having to study their ship to understand what is going on.  Thus
the same control panel exists on a Vilani fat trader as exists
on their air/rafts and their most sophisticated fighters.  The
compromise design is good, but any compromise in engineering tends
to lessen performance.
     Vilani attitude controls look like a cross between a
control yoke and motorcycle handle bars.  Rudder pedals are not
present as they are in Solomani designs, and yaw control is linked
to the handle bars.  Yaw movement is coordinated with the roll
control producing a controlled turn and bank.  Flying a Vilani
built craft is very similar to driving a ground car.  The lack of
individual yaw makes a cross controlled \'slip\' maneuver somewhat
more difficult in Vilani aircraft.
     Lack of yaw control is compensated for by the presence of
crosswind landing gear.  Crosswind gear allow the craft to land
while the ship\'s nose is not pointing along the direction of
travel.  The gear is mounted on casters akin to the wheels on a
shopping cart.  However, they make high speed taxi difficult and
hazardous as the wheels do not aide in turning the aircraft.
     The throttle is mounted on the left handle bar as if it were
a motorcycle.  This allows for a HOTAS system.
     Many minor races prefer Vilani flight control system layouts
as they are among the simplest human layouts to operate for most
manipulatory appendages.  They do not require input from the feet
and can usually be managed with one hand or other appendage.
Another advantage is that Vilani systems do not require the foot
pedal rudder controls of standard Imperial equipment:  Difficult to
manage when your feet are like a rhino\'s, or you don\'t have feet...
LLELLEWYLOLY and VIRUSHI prefer Vilani layouts.

ZHODANI
     Almost all Zhodani pilots come from the noble ranks.  Flight
controls for their ships are open for flicking.  Thus the
psi-trained Zhodani pilot may change the ship\'s attitude, throttle
settings, and weapons by flicking.  Special safe guards are in
place to prevent outside psionic interference in the piloting of
the ship.  Up to and including a psi-shield surrounding the
pilot\'s station.  This is demonstrated in the Shivva class patrol
frigate and her fighters.  The fighter pilots are open to
telepathic contact from their flight controller, but the flight
controller can not affect flight controls of the fighter.
     There also exist manual controls for all craft.  Not all
pilots are nobles, and enlisted & prole pilots use the manual
controls.  Also proles operating grav vehicles and the like have a
need for manual controls.  While one would think that manual flight
controls would be of lesser quality because of the dependance on
psi-controls, this is far from the truth.  With their wealth of
insight into the human mind, data presentation among the Zhodani
is a fine art.  Screens with flight data are very well presented
in such a manner so as not to swamp the pilot with data.
However, manual controls do tend to receive secondary attention
in Zhodani cockpit design.
     Controls are generally mounted on the arms of the flight
acceleration couch.  The stick is generally mounted on the left,
and the throttle on the right.  Often times, with a Psionic pilot
in command, the controls are stowed inside the chair arms and,
with a press of a switch, can be deployed in emergencies.
     Yaw control is subsumed into the stick in a rotational
manner.  Turn the stick to the right and the ship yaws right.
This last is a reflection of how manual flight controls are
considered secondary.
(MOTAS?  Mind On Throttle And Stick?)

VARGR
     Vargr flight controls do not follow general lines making it
difficult to generalize.  But, their control systems tend to be
similar to human designs at least where hands are concerned.
Their digitigrade stance makes their foot controls quite
different.  Rudder pedals are rare, and yaw control tends to be
absorbed into the stick as Vilani and Zhodani designs.
     Aslan control systems are sometimes copied by Vargr.

ASLAN
     Aslan flight controls are a set of half gloves set into the
arms of the acceleration couch.  They look somewhat like large
balls on the ends of the chair arms.  The hand is placed atop the
ball in deep indentations in it for the hand.  (Picture a big wax
ball with a hole the shape of your hand melted into it.)  (Rather
like Hiver controls with deeper indentations)
     This design meshes with the Aslan philosophy that the ship
is but an extension of the pilot.  The \'gloves\' make the ship
part of him.  The ship follows the motion of the hand, much as a
human stick would do.  The extension of the dew-claw fires the
ships weapons on ship\'s where the pilot is in control of the guns.
A similar control is for the aiming and firing of ship\'s weapons.
     Attitude control is usually controlled by both hands on
separate controls.  With roll and pitch on one hand and yaw on the
other.  Though some control units have pitch, roll and yaw all on
one ball.  Throttle control is in foot pedals.

DROYNE
     Droyne controls are one of the most unusual.  Attitude
controls are mounted beside the pilot.  They are low level infra-
red sensors that sense the position of the pilot\'s wings and
tail.  Though the Droyne generally have great difficulty in
flying, they do still possess the equipment for rudimentary
flight, and the instincts to do so (though buried).  To raise the
nose of the ship, the pilot would increase the angle of attack of
his wings.  The sensors see the change in wing angle and perform
the maneuver.  If the pilot raises his right wing, the ship will
bank left, and so on.
     Yaw maneuvering is controlled by tail movement.
     Throttle control is based around the width which the wings are
spread.  The closer the wings are drawn in, the higher the thrust.
Much as a flying droyne would pull his wings in while diving.
     Pilots usually wear a small set of infra-red reflectors
(looking something like large clip on earrings) around the joints
in their wings and tail to aid in the sensing of the pilots wing
positions.  These IR reflectors are part of a Droyne pilot\'s
uniform.  Sufficiently high technology (TL 10) allows sufficient
sensor capability that these reflectors are not necessary, but they
continue to be worn as the mark of a pilot.
     Below TL 8, Droyne pilots must rely on boosted mechanical
linkages from to their wings to the flight controls.
     AEL YAEL, while unable to build ships will commonly adapt
control panels to this type of configuration.

HIVERS
     Hiver controls are balls mounted with control studs.  This is
the form best suited \'ergonomically` to their limbs.  Control is
similar to a control stick in terms of attitude (forward, back,
turn etc.).  Throttle control is based on the amount of pressure
exerted on the control ball.  The tighter the grip, the more thrust
applied.  Hiver controls are very difficult for anyone but a hiver
to operate, thus, many of their ships employ dual control panels,
to allow for a member race to use them.  The Federation Member
control panels are similar to Aslan designs, though the indentation
in the control globes is not so deep as the Aslan half gloves.
This arrangement allows the hiver better control than he would
manage with a Solomani design.

K\'KREE
     The K\'Kree have probably the most bizarre arrangement of
attitude control.  The pilot lies in a couch arrangement with his
four hooves touching the floor.  By leaning in one direction or
another, the ship\'s attitude is changed.  It looks something like
flying a hang glider.  To roll left, lean left.  To lower the
nose:  lean forward.  To pull up:  lean back.  Yaw control is by
twisting the body to the right or left.  Throttle control is by
hand levers.
     The leaning method of attitude control dates back to the
earliest K\'kree experiments in flight.  Their earliest gliders
used this method of steering, then their primitive aircraft.
After that, it was too entrenched in conservative K\'kree
engineering philosophy to ever change.

VEGANS (Not the nuts with vegetables :-)
     Vegan flight controls are geared toward their own set of
unique physiology.  They rely heavily on inertial compensators as
their somewhat weak limbs have difficulty overcoming high
acceleration.  Ships which do not have inertial compensators in the
entire ship will nevertheless have a region where they are
installed:  around the pilot.
     Controls are mounted in sockets inside the acceleration couch.
A pilot inserts his tentacles into the sockets to make control
adjustments.  The position of the tentacles is sensed and attitude
adjustments are made.
     Vegan control consoles look somewhat strange to human eyes in
that all controls are mounted very close together in a very compact
data presentation.  This is because of the construction of the
Vegan neck which restricts side to side head movements.

AGRICOLANS
     (Remember an Agricolan looks like a swimming Tyrannosaurus.)
     Agricolans being powerful swimmers, have adapted to using
their powerful rudder-like tails as direction and attitude control.
Their control mechanisms are somewhat similar to the mechanical
Droyne flight controls, though none of the IR systems are present.
The Agricolan lies prone on its belly, with its tail fitted into a
holder linked to the control systems.  Throttle control is by foot
pedals, while other controls (communications, weapons) are mounted
up by the Agricolan\'s small manipulator hands.
     R-Alpha\'s Phins probably use something similar.

GENERAL RAMBLINGS
=================
I have been lurking and listening for a while, and so thought it was
about time I sent in some comments.

Wildstar:
My Traveller campaign is currently at 317/1107, so I think I have
a way to go before hitting the Rebellion - allowing for no changes in
History along the way, of course 8-). So, I wouldn\'t mind seeing your old
Classic Traveller stuff either.  If you don\'t want to post it again to
TML I would appreciate you email me at the following INTERNET address:

langsl@hhcs.gov.au

 ...thanks in advance.  Let me know if there is any I can do for you in
return.

Metlay & James Perkins:
I like your comments regarding courtesy.  Well said.

RE: \'THE NEW ERA\' (TNE)
- ----

I am looking forward to TNE to see what you come up with.  With this in
mind I have provided a list of some things I would like to see in the
game.

TNE WISH LIST
=============

RE: DESIGN RULES
- ----

If I buy the TNE rules + TNE Imperium sourcebook combination I would
like to be able to start play as soon as possible.  Having to stop to
design starships, ground vehicles etc is the last thing I want to do.

I would prefer to see a longer list of equipment, including vehicles for
Air, Sea, Land, Space, and Interstellar Travel, rather than a long set of
detailed design rules.  In my own roleplaying the design rules have not
featured in the games I have run, and very little in any games I have
played in.  Thus they would be of little use to me initially, whereas a
good list of equipment is always of use.

From what I have seen of Twilight 2000, Merc 2000, and Dark Conspiracy
they have very well presented equipment sections.  They also have good
building plans, which I find to be of great use too. I hope TNE emulates
this approach.

Rather than full detailed design rules on how to start from scratch,
rules on options for varying the standard designs might be a better way
to go in the basic rules.  This would allow even more vehicles to be
easily constructed from the standards presented.

Design rules _have_ featured in Trillion Credit style play by mail cam-
paigns which I have played in, so I wouldn\'t mind seeing some design rules
eventually, or released at the same time but in a self contained volume.

If these design rules for vehicles, robots etc were _all_ together, tested
and workable, this would save hunting through basic rules, supplements etc
whenever you wanted to design something, or check something in the design
rules.  Another advantage of this approach is that you would have room to
go into the detail that some people appreciate, in a separate volume that
only these people need buy.

It would be nice if the design rules were easily tunable too - so you
can have a campaign where ordinary individuals can own a starship
because they cost 1/10  or 1/20 say of standard Traveller\'s pricing.

RE:ECONOMICS
- ----

It would be nice if you could include some ideas on how economics is sup-
posed to work too, as background to the trade rules.  I am not asking for
a treatise on economics - just some guidelines to help when trading comes
up in a game.

RE: DIFFERENT METHODS FOR SPACE/INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL
- ----

I have no objection to this - I would *like* to see some variety.  Jump,
Gate, and [Stutter]Warp systems seem as good a start as any.  Advice
on tuning them would be useful too - then beginning refs can construct
a universe which more faithfully models their intention or favourite
sci fi novel.

RE:STUTTERWARP & SHIP COMBAT
- ----
I don\'t think 2300\'s stutterwarp as is will work in the Imperium back-
ground.  I like the game mechanics though - you could present this as
an alternative to using a delta-vee system for ship maneuvre and combat.

You could tone down the stutterwarp efficiency so that it becomes closer
to jump drive in performance - perhaps only better in certain circum-
stances.  In this way you could have a Traveller version of stutterwarp
which works for Traveller.

COACC\'s approach for aerial dogfights is also good - they provide an
abstract system, which I use, and a more detailed system to resolve as
a board game, which I don\'t - though I would like to try it some time.
I think this is a good approach. You serve the needs of those who like a
board game style of resolution, and those who don\'t.  Two different
abstract systems, or two different board game systems, would not be as
good in my opinion.

Both these approaches are better for -roleplaying- ship to ship combats
than High Guard - at least in my humble opinion.

RE: WORLD BOOKS, LIKE GURPS, FOR DIFFERENT SETTINGS.
- ----

I like the idea of a 2300 world book for this system.  One of the groups
I play with likes the 2300 setting _a lot_, and dislike the 2300 rules
(not STARCRUISER...they love this too) equally as emphatically.  I am
currently using CYBERPUNK 2020 as the rules to run a 2300 game (minus the
CYBERPUNK aspects presented in the EARTH/CYBERTECH source book), and people
find it a good fit - nice simple mechanics that they understand, and a
_much_ more pleasant universe.

Since we haven\'t gotten very far yet they might be interested in helping
playtest TNE rules for a 2300 setting. (unsubtle hint)... 8-)

LASTLY (phew I hear you say 8-)
- ----

I have recently had an opportunity to look through the rules for STAR
WARS RPG.  I like their approach of having rules for trade, ship combat,
world design etc biased toward either being easy to ROLEPLAY with, or
provide opportunities for roleplaying.  This is what I would like to see
with TNE.  I think it is what the original Traveller had, despite its
warts, that Megatraveller doesn\'t.

   Can we stop bickering about the reality of if GDW is reading this
list or not?  It\'s gotten a little boring and really has no real bear-
ing on why this list was set up ---- to discuss Traveller...

   Howz about this: Talk about things you WANT to see in the newer
evolution of the Traveller line...  I know if I had a chance to look
at the game or playtest it I\'d make d*mn sure it had a system for
computers (even Challenge magazine had an article recently that pointed
out the weaknesses of the older Travellers!).  Being a computer engin-
eering major I hate to crack open a new RPG and see some sorry excuse
for a computer system, something that has absolutely no basis in real
computational theory (I haven\'t found a system yet that has done it).
Having seen this as a continuing fad (designers being unable to create
a working system that supports computers and related technologies), I
and a few friends have resigned ourselves to adding new system modifi-
cations in order for a computer system to really exist...

    Now I KNOW there are those out there in Netland who feel the same
way about other systems within the older Travellers...  Who knows, after
we gripe about it we could get together and write something that satis-
fies all of our collective criteria - hopefully BEFORE TNE is released.

    As I said, I\'m currently learning the T2000 system and will be
re-reading some passages in Trav and Mega-Trav to run a hybrid game where
I live...  If I work on a new computer system, and it works, would any-
body want it (I mean to read and re-playtest)?  I plan to do this re-
gardless if I playtest TNE or not...

Hear, hear!  Now that someone from GDW actually reads TML, we may
have slightly better than the proverbial snowball\'s chance of being

like this!  I am looking forward to seeing it!

Gee, I just said I had some Traveller-related things I have to do ...
this is one of them!  I am going through my files now, and will be
posting things to TML as I discover them.

I like to see a decent selection of vehicles included with the game, but
I am a designer at heart.  One of my favorite solataire activities with
Classic Traveller was designing ships for many and varied purposes.

This might be a good idea for the basic rulebook.  However, I would want
the ability to design vehicles from "scratch".  This capability is very
important to me, and I would be willing to spend additional money (over
and above the basic rules set) to get it.  This is indeed what I had to
do in Classic Traveller (I purcased Striker for the design system alone;
I have never played it as a wargame or as part of a rpg campaign, except
as a demonstration of miniatures combat).

If such an "add-on" design system is selected, I strongly suggest that
it be designed and playtested at the same time as the basic rules.  The
reason for this is so that the two fit seamlessly together, and so that
the "simplified" system presented in the basic rules is compatible with
the advanced "add-on" system purchased separately.

Yes; I whole-heartedly agree with this.  I would much rather get all of
the design rules in one suppliment for an additional price than to have
some of them included for "free" in the basic game, and then have the
rest spread out over half a dozen suppliments and sourcebooks.

The economic background bears a little extra thought.  One of the
recurring and recent topics on TML is the economics of Traveller.  About
the only consensus we have ever reached is that the available
information is too inconsistent and fragmentary to draw any rock-solid
conclusions from.

By one set of calculations, the amount of trade in the Third Imperium
was such a small portion of the Gross Imperial Product that no-one would
have noticed the onset of Hard Times: the economic impact of the loss of
a sector of the economy responsible for a less than 0.1% of an average
planet\'s economy is ... well negligible.

By another set of calculations, the Imperial Navy budget was large
enough to easily afford complete protection (in terms of a globe of
warships with weapon and sensor ranges out to 100 diameters) from piracy
for every one of the 11,000 worlds of the Third Imperium ... with plenty
of money left over for a subsector and reserve fleet.

Admittedly, these are two extremes, but this does give an idea of the
magnitude of the uncertainty!

Since one of the features of the New Era is supposed to be a period of
trade expansion and exploration, the economic benefits driving this
expansion could use some explanation.

The only problem I see is ensuring that one drive technology does not
"overpower" the others, by being superior in every way.  That is the
danger with the stutterwarp proposal.

A good point here, in my opinion.  Most of my players did not like
miniatures combat - either for starships or for personal combat.  While
we improvised abstract systems, an official abstract combat system,
especially for space combat, would be a good feature.

The name of the game is science-fiction roleplaying.  The idea is for
the referee and players to co-operatively tell a story.  One for which
everyone involved is willing to suspend disbelief.  When this happens,
you can really become your character, and role-playing begins.  If this
does not happen, then all you are doing is rolling dice and pushing
pencils.  Game rules which do not further roleplaying are part of the
problem; game rules which provide opportunities for roleplaying are part
of the solution.

In Classic Traveller, this suspension of disbelief happened; for us, the
best role-playing was done without reference to any rulebook, and without
rolling any dice.  We "got into our character\'s heads" and what followed
was as close as we could come to the world of the far future.

In MegaTraveller, the typoes, errata, inconsistancies, and the dizzying
swirl of Rebellion-era events got in the way far too often.  This is not
to say that the magic never happened, but that it was all too
infrequent, and usually ended with puzzled looks as we stumbled over
some new impossibility.

(I feel as if I have wandered away from my more usual facts and
 considered opinions into a nebulous area of philosophy.  Chalk it
 up to the late hour, and if you disagree, flame me in the morning).

                Dear TML readers,

     I have recently been delving back into the TML archives to read up on
the discussions held about the TNE virus story. A number of things have become
apparent to me from this reading;
     The virus story is (or at least can be brushed off as) a plot device for
the TNE background.
     It has some plausability holes in it wide enough for one to drive a
G-Carrier through. No-one can honestly doubt this.
     However, it has a lot of roleplaying potential, particularly since the
agent in question is a managable, transportable, physical entity.
     Although Traveller is most often played by people of above average
education (I\'d hate to absolutely associate this with intelligence), as far as
fine details of scientific plausability is concerned, they can be considered as
well-informed lay people. People on the TML may jump up and down at this but I
don\'t think we constitute "average" consumers of the product. Most people I
know who play Traveller wouldn\'t know how to turn a computer on let alone find
out about and subscribe to a mailing list.
        Therefore, the virus story should stand up to consumer acceptance
especially if it is tweeked a little bit more (certainly, some of the
constructive criticism that has come from this group could be of great
use here)
        However, I for one will not be using the story unless it is
significantly changed and I don\'t think anyone would deny me this prerogative.
        What I will use is something similar and still embryonic but I thought
some people here would be interested in hearing about it.
 ============================================================================
        Genetic algorithms are a current but fledgling technology. For a review
I would direct you to;

    Holland, J. H. (1992). Genetic Algorithms. Scientific American. July. 44-50.

        The gist of this technology can be summerized in the following quote
from the above paper;

        "By harnessing the mechanisms of evolution, researchers may be able to
"breed" programs that solve problems even when no person can fully understand
their structure."
        Impressive results have already been made. The example given in the
the paper is the design of jet engines.
   ----
        I will subject my players to this scenerio;

      Imperial researchers have been studying genetic algorithms for some time
(indeed the research has been going on since the mid-1960\'s here on Terra).
Combine this field of research with A.I. research and massive computer power and
interesting things begin to happen. Lucan\'s researchers where doing just that at
the time of the Rebellion. Under desperate circumstances they began evolving a
primative A.I. program. Completely underestimating the power of the process and
the level of computer security they posessed they created a "monster" which
quickly travelled through the Imperial computer networks and harboured itself
quietly in unexpected corners of memory. With evolution continuing at an
alarming rate and an almost unlimited access to memory not to mention a totally
malignant ego (something only a computer could understand) there was no stopping
"it".  The malign ego is essential at least at the moment for the plot.
       The "virus" moved to other worlds either mascarading as data down-loads
or as actual programs. The latter was easy because it was able to vastly
compact the original program by simply evolving a far more efficient algorithm.
Hence no-one suspected because the programs were the same size and did the same
jobs. If anyone was looking, well the virus just gave them what they expected to
see on the screen. (Come to think of it, this could be happening right now!
Who\'s paranoid, I\'m not). For an A.I. that knows EVERYTHING about computer
systems "even when no person can fully understand their structure" it was not
very dificult for the virus to infiltrate military and commercial security. True
it was hard to get to "closed" computer systems but you can always get a dumb
organic sophont to intervene for you.
       For reasons known only to itself it rather rapidly "destroyed" the
Imperium. Maybe that was the best thing to happen. Although it caused untold
hardship and death it may have broken a futile cycle of warring and oppression.
Is it the closest thing to an angel yet seen? Was it simply a plan of it\'s own
to spare Deneb? Here is lots of opportunity for a bright future. A true new
start plus lots of religious cults, a bit of Ludditism etc.
      But I can hear you asking, "How was it stopped?". There could be a number
of possibilities. I havn\'t decided which I\'ll use yet.
       1) It didn\'t. It just made it look like it was. Somewhere in an old hard
drive it still waits. Or maybe it resides, and controlls?, a MegaCorporation\'s
computer. Imagine the players comming across a much better thought out version
of Tron! Then again, maybe some old crackpot hermit keeps the "holy" print-out
in a temple somewhere. That print-out just happens to be the core program. Sort
of like being in a sporolated form or like a real virus, not really alive and
not really dead.
        2) Like a real virus that is subject to evolutionary pressures it
mutated into a milder, coexisting form; there is no point in totally destroying
your host although it is possible. Once it became a nice guy it underestimated
the invidious nature of Man who erased it completely while it was sleeping one
day in the high memory buffer! Although this possibility is based on some solid
scientific facts it ignores things like quasi-species, vectors and resevoirs
which makes it a low option with me. Also, how do you sneek up on such a thing?
        3) Known space simply switched to a new computing medium and or ethos
that was able to thwart the virus. I don\'t like this one very much also.
        4) Someone designed and let loose an avatar A.I. to do battle with the
creep and the good guys won. However, every modem in the known universe was
burnt out in the process and hence society collapsed when everyone found out
that they couldn\'t get the TML any more.
        I admit that it\'s a bit difficult to think of a good way to end the
"plot device" without generating a totally paranoid universe but I\'m happier
with the above scenerio than the one originally put forward by GDW, sorry guys.
        A few self criticisms;
   ----
        Is this really that much different from the sophont chip story?

       I think there is a much more believable "biology" to this little critter.
Although it is a bit more difficult to grasp, especially in your hand!, I find
the information theory and metaphysical aspects of it more challenging. Granted
it\'s not all that original (Tron, Wintermute....sound familiar?) but neither is
jump space.

        Is it more plausable?

      Based slightly on current technology and theory and adding a bit of
fiction to science, it keeps all the essential plot requirements of the original

        Does it allow for some interesting roleplaying?

      Religions based on A.I. remenants or just remembered. Residual "code"
found in expected and not so expected places (remember the print-out?). Anti-
computer, and even technology, societies. Basically all the usuall roleplaying
possibilities as with the original scenerio except this guy is a little more
ethereal and volitile.

        Is it resolvable so that the game can go on?

      Anything is resolvable given enough time/effort/imagination although I
will definitely be setting TNE anything up to 500 years after the Rebellion
rather than a measily 70 years. In my mind, 70 years, particularly in an
interstellar community is diddly-squat for society to collapse. On high
population worlds maybe but who could forget the Imperium in just 70 years? Look
how much we know about WWI.

        I am not a computer expert by any stretch of the imagination and so I
will conceed that my scenerio may seem just as laughable as GDW\'s when read by
someone in the know. I know that molecular biology written for scifi ALWAYS
makes me laugh. I have posted it however simply as a GMing discussion.

         While I am here, I strongly agree with the comments made by Theresa
Verity and Alistair Langford about giving GDW our wishes for TNE. In fact if
someone could come up with a standard list of topics GDW could literally do
statistis on which ideas are most prefered. But then again, just trying to
decide on the list could take months of haggling!

        For those who have made it all the way to the end of this, wow! your
keen. Sorry for waffling for so long.

Are the Solomani left-handed in the far future, then?  Because, being
right-handed, I\'d want the stick in my right hand as that is the control
which needs the most control, so to speak.  Someone will correct me if I
am wrong, but I believe the F-16\'s cockpit is laid out like this - the

Is this correct?  Someone who knows the insides of a wide-bodied passenger

Has anyone seen the computer flight simulator game "Birds of Prey"?
Evidently, the author is Vilani - the same cockpit display is used
for all the aircraft in the game, from a Harrier to a B-52.

In a word, *@!%.  I have enough problems controlling a shopping trolley
at low speeds in 2D.  (This comment is not on whether or not the Vilani
would actually make such a system; I imagine that trained people would
get used to it, just as frequent shoppers eventually get the hang of
trolleys.  I just want to see a video of the face of the first Solomani
pilot who tried to land a Vilani fighter. :-)

That\'s a neat trick, building a shield round the controls only so as
to leave the pilot unshielded, but also leaving the controls open to
the pilot.  Is there just a small hole in the shield, pointed at the
pilot?  What happens when the hole is also pointed at the Shivva?

They\'re not the only ones!  What does a human do in a Droyne ship, given
that the average human is even more lacking in the wing department than
the average Droyne?

What did they do before they invented/were given inertial compensators?
Are there any low-tech Vegan aircraft?

To get pure water to process for fuel what happens to all of the
salts, especially from ocean water. From the amounts being bandied

the local environment. And processing it for export would be redun-

more than the local chemical companies need.

BTW, is fuel liquid or compressed gas?

Based on the assumption that it takes two MCr worth of civilian shipping
to generate the revenue to support one MCr worth of warship, I once worked
out that the civilian shipping tonnage in Aramis Subsector (we get quite a
lot of info about merchant shipping in Aramis in "The Traveller Adventure")
should be almost precisely 100 times as great as it was. My solution is to
say that 99% of all civilian shipping is hyper- and mega-freighters
(100,000 to million tons freighters) engaged in routine, year in, year out
freighting of bulk material. Such ships are so expensive that only with an
iron-clad decade-long contract will anyone build them. They are NOT used
for speculative trade, and their scedules are as predictable (and as dull)
as anything. The last percent is the luxury trade, and every merchant ship
we\'ve ever seen in an Old Traveller or Megatraveller scenario belongs to
the luxury trade (well, in the case of Free Traders the proper word is
speculative, but you know what I mean.

The above suggestion reconciles the two views. Of course, if you don\'t
agree with the basic assumption the whole thing falls apart.

The thing one has to realize is that we not dealing with SF enactment but
SF gaming. Much of the hardware we have TODAY tends to outpower the people
involved. If you extrapolate a propable future technology lots of classic
science fiction and adventure ideas becomes unlikely or even impossible.
That\'s why I don\'t like infallible laser-guided bang-you\'re-dead guns,
pinpoint neutrino detectors, or gene-type identification methods. Sure,
a laser is really more a flashlight that kills, but would you like to
referee a fight with that kind of weaponry? "Roll a die and add your
<appropiate characteristic>. The one who rolls highest wins." Some of
my players complain that their slug-throwers are too damn mundane for a
science fiction game, but what\'s the fun of can\'t miss weaponry? Somehow
I don\'t think that I\'d like gaming in a REALLY realistic future milieu.

The thing that really needs to be done about the tech levels is to get them
divorced from Terran historical dates. Just because we have it in 1990 it
dosen\'t have to be TL 8, and just because we don\'t have it dosen\'t mean it
can\'t be TL 8.

system, the ship combat system works.  The ship design system works.
The world/system generation system (especially as in WBH) works.
Admittedly, the man-to-man combat system is rather awkward, but with
some hand-waving and improvising tasks it can be made to work without
getting in the way of the game too badly -- it also helps that my
campaign has had little hand-to-hand combat.  With some filtering
through a reality check, star system/world generation works (I
computer-generate about three systems for each one used).
    What the MT system really has going for it is preserving game
flow.  I very rarely find the need to look up numbers in the rules.
With an SF game in particular, it is necessary to improvise almost all
the time.  My campaign is driven by the actions and motivations of the
players (and the NPCs), and it is just not possible to prepare enough
material to cover all eventualities.
    The task system is (IMHO) the best thing to have ever happened to
RPGs.  With a feel for it, I don\'t need character details for any NPC
they meet just in case that person ends up associating with the group
- -- from what I know about the person, and I can make their task rolls
with a good degree of consistency without ever needing to work out the
numbers until it becomes clear that the exact skill numbers and mix
becomes important.  One NPC had a character sheet almost soon as she
joined the crew; others have done without for almost two years (game
time).  I like a system where I can concentrate on the game instead of
the system.
    I am glad to hear that the task system is to be retained for TNE
- -- albeit evolved, but why not refine the rules?  I *love* the task
system (did I already say that?).
    I am not thrilled at the concept of throwing out all the ship
designs.  I have a lot of personal time invested in an interactive
starship design programme.  Yes, the rules are complex.  I have
designed a few ships by hand, and it is a real pain.  I have designed
substantially more by computer, and that is fun -- the players of the
ship\'s engineer characters have even spent some time playing "what
if?" with it.  Too *few* details would hurt that.
    I want a free-flowing game system where I can concentrate on the
role-playing, not the rules.  The task system is great for this.  (Did
I say that already?)
    I want a fun, detailed, ship design system.  Why not provide two
levels of detail?  By analogy with system generation: one to work out
the UPP quickly, and one to go into details of surface temperature and
so on.  Let one ship design be workable by hand, let the other be
workable by paintaking hours of fiddling (or a few minutes on a
computer).  Heck, why not sell a computer programme yourselves?  I\'d
gladly pay real money for the software to do that -- *if* it was well
designed, with an interface that made it easy to fiddle with the
details (preferably running under Windows).  Bundle it with a star
system generator (yes, I *do* need to know surface temperature,
gravity, day length, and so on), perhaps with fifty or so
pre-generated sectors and several hundred pre-generated craft (just as
well sell your test data :-) ), plus a wealth of library data, and put
the whole thing on a CD-ROM I\'d gladly pay $89.99 for.  It\'d be worth
easily that much to me (were I to adopt TNE rules) for the time it
would save.
    I want a combat system that is relatively easy to use.  Firefights
must maintain a fast flow when role-played, or the involvement is lost
too easily.  "I leap round the corner, and give the first guy I see
both barrels!"  It should not take substantially longer to play it
than to say it.  (I like the MT concept of alternate unit moves and
task interrupting, but the way hit and damage are calculated I find,
quite frankly, tedious.  I don\'t know T:2000, I would guess that it
has a better feel since that\'s it\'s emphasis.  I mostly hand-wave a lot
and improvise.)
    Ship combat can be more complex.  I like many aspects of the MT
system: a twenty-minute move gives a stately feel to it -- like the
perception of surface naval battles that several people seem desperate
to emulate, quite rightly I think.  That\'s a long time -- the rules
can work much more slowly without interrupting the game feel.  There
is time for the Captain to discuss munition choice with the Chief
Gunner ("I say nuke\'m, Cap\'n!"); there is time for the Medical Officer
to attend those injured during the last turn by role-playing -- not
just "I go there and treat his wounds," but the need to find an open
way through, perhaps push past Jeff and Shelley fixing the junction
box in the corridor, past where a frantic Steward is trying to get the
passengers calmed down, only finally reaching the mess area where he
is needed so urgently.  There\'s a lot of room for role-playing in this
sort of ship combat, and I\'d hate to see it interrupted by the rules:
"I <we fire> say <they fire> nuke <hold it, we haven\'t worked out the
damage yet.  OK, carry on> \'em <we turn and run> Cap\'n!"
    I do have one very strong negative on MT: whoever insulted our
intelligence with that space-combat movement system must have a lot of
bad karma.  As written, everyone should accelerate from the beginning
of the combat until it\'s over, as that gives you the biggest maximum
move -- you can always move less, after all, you can use up that 120
hex move by circling in one spot!  That movement system was discarded
before the campaign started, replaced by a simple vector system that
gave enough concessions to Newton to pass a basic reality check.

Enough of the rules, now on to background:
    My campaign has now reached 354-1118.  Strephon is Emperor.  There
was no Rebellion.  There are no Hard Times.  Archduke Norris is a
great and honoured diplomat for preventing the Fifth Frontier War.
    I hate the darkness of a perpetually miserable life in RPGs.  It\'s
hard to have fun that way, and a solid stable Imperium has a lot of
places to have fun.  The players have been snow-skiing and sunbathing
on Spirelle; some partied in a prospector bar in the Zaibon belt; some
have been inducted into strange cults on Iderati; they traded for
dried beans on Faldor and now brew whisky and coffee from them; but
they have also been far outside the Imperium, communicated with
friendly aliens, fought unfriendly aliens (on the ground and, more
often, in space), and investigated a case of sabotage.  They\'re now
heading back towards the Imperium, not the least for a long-overdue
jump drive maintenance.  They have been involved in bad times,
suspicion, and violence, but it\'s not a necessary way of life forced
on them by the campaign background.
    There has to be room to be human.
    I chose to reject the Rebellion because everything suddenly
becomes too scripted and there is too little freedom for the players.
To me, a role-playing game is all about character development, and
that blossoms with freedom of choice.  All too often, the Rebellion
background seems to put characters in situations where there are no
choices and therefore no interaction and development.

So, if TNE is a good rules set, and I can convert readily from MT, I
may use it.  If it has a good fast-moving man-to-man combat system
using already-established Traveller weapons (snub pistol, ACR, FGMP,
etc.) where I can improvise NPC opponents on the spot (who knows which
tavern they will invade? :-) ), it will be worth buying for me.  The
background will not be useful to me, I fear, unless one of the
supplements is _We Have Always Been As We Are_ (a saying attributed to
Queen Victoria, I believe), which presents an alternate where the
Imperium never fell.  I suspect an upbeat background might sell well.

 ..but heck, what do I know?  I liked _Starship Operators\' Manual_...
and _Space 1889_, come to that.  I suppose I\'m just weird.

This is one of the things that was covered in the "Traveller Done Right"

This customer was not pleased, and has communicated this displeasure to the
seller.  If GDW wants to hear nice things, then they should publish only
those games that they can stand behind with pride (Twilight:2000 definitely
does fall int this category; unfortunately, it is not a genre in which I
enjoy playing.  The same goes for Dark Conspiracy).

Or are you telling me that I should only say good things about FSSI?  Well,
I suppose the artwork was OK; but the fact of the matter is that it was a
shoddy product that should never have been allowed out of the door.

There have been very few MegaTraveller products where I felt satisfied with
my purchase.  For reference, these exceptions have been the DGP Alien
volumes, the Flaming Eye sourcebook, and the GDW Hard Times.  I have also
just purchased Diaspora and Assignment: Vigilante (and detailed comments
will follow shortly) and my overall impression of these two is good.

Good!  I should certainly hope that TML will not change significantly in tone
or character.  A good amount of useful information gets exchanged here; and
refusing to discuss the flaws of a poor product out of "consideration" for
GDW\'s feelings will not help TML or GDW in the long run.

If you\'re ever in the Washington DC area, send me E-Mail or call me at home
(301)-871-5104 and we can try to get together.  I\'m always interested in
meeting TML members whenever it can be arranged; if there is anybody else
lurking out there that will be in the area, give a call and we\'ll at least
talk!

I don\'t believe that I\'ve ever written anything (either for TML or for any
other public net.forum) that I would not have said in a print letter to or
in a face-to-face conversation with any of the persons involved.

Perhaps the configuration of the sword worlds was so tempting (in terms of
easy jump-1 accessability, mineral resources, etc.) that the only fly in the

I don\'t know of anything published that nails down the date of the Gene
War.  But I have a proposal about the "Gene War".  Perhaps it could refer to
a war in wich a tailored bioagent was used in an attempted genocide?  The
Sword Worlders, being of fairly uniform ethnic background, would have made a
good target for such an attack.  Being the first such attempt, it may not
have been lethal enough to kill everyone infected.  On the other hand, after
surviving such an attack, I would certainly not stick around to see if the
enemy could get it right.  Perhaps such a war would have been over religous,
cultural, or philosophical differences; humans always have been, and still
are, and probably will be forever killing one another for reasons like
these.

I don\'t know about anyone else, but I can see the rationale behind the new
rules set and the New Era background.  If well thought out, competently
written, and properly edited, it will be enjoyable to play and to write
for.  I want to do everything I can to make sure that TNE is the best game
that it can be.

Speaking for myself (but I suspect that this is true of many others here as
well), I wouldn\'t be giving GDW so much heat if I didn\'t care about them
and about their products.  GDW has done some pretty amazing things in the
past, and (in my opinion) *SHOULD* still be capable of them.  This makes it
awfully dissapointing when products are so poor.  Recent MegaTraveller
products (in particular: Hard Times, Assignment: Vigilante, and Diaspora
Sector) have given me hope that GDW can remember how to do good work.

However, it bears repeating (yet one more time) that a careful editing job,
combined with outside playtesting would have caught almost all of the
crippling problems with MegaTraveller before they grew to embarrasing
proportions.

I have to agree.  It is in this area that GDW will make or break Traveller:
The New Era.  I, too would rather wait than have to put up with the kind of
mess that accompanied MegaTraveller.  If that sort of thing happens again,
it will probably kill Traveller.  Dead.  Forever.  And that would be bad.

Specific suggestions for GDW include:
  (1) A careful internal edit and review.  Preferably get someone who is
      interested but not already familliar with the material; this is the
      best way to quickly spot many types of errors.
  (2) Outside playtesting involving a large number of players of a broad
      range of experience levels.  This means getting TML and HIWG
      involved as well trying to pull in people who have never even seen
      a rpg before.
  (3) Remain open to outside ideas; nobody can think of everything all the
      time.  I am willing to bet that at least one playtest group comes
      up with an new idea that would significantly improve the game in
      ways the designers never even considered.

Believe it or not, I haven\'t had any comments on my virus posting yet.  For

Come to think of it, I haven\'t heard anything on the starport traffic and

I\'ve got to agree with Cynthia here.  MegaTraveller has cost GDW a good bit

This would be a good idea.  We\'re not talking about any sort of big
"secrets" here; most new TMLers (at least, the ones that don\'t begin by
asking questions) post something where they tell who they are, what they
do, how they feel about Traveller, and what they hope to get out of TML.

Hmmm.  This could work.  Or perhaps they did only a cursory survey (which
noted the existance of low-tech human settlements) and failed to notice the
remnants of the previous high-tech Darrian civilization.  Figuring that a
couple of backward planets wouldn\'t be too much to handle if ever there was
a need to, they went ahead and settled next door.

It would be interesting to have more robots around but two basic problems

1. At what (AI) intelligence level do robots become Imperial citizens?
   This leads you off into splinter groups for the freedom of toasters and
   the end of slavery for all machines 8-}.

2. This is the one that prevents robots or aware machines from continuing
   after the VIRUS.  On every planet where the VIRUS struck, one of the
   main methods of "getting even" with organic life-forms would be to take
   over all these robots and machines and kill everything.  This will of
   course leave some phobias to any mechanical-self-mobile-machine.  NOBODY,
   will want a robot around (as a cleaner, or waiter, or baby sitter, or
   mechanic, or doctor or dentist or anything).  I think the GDW\'s VIRUS
   idea just shot robots in the foot.

Hmmm.  Everytime I think of Nano-technology sized hunter-killer weapons being
mass produced in some weapons factory the word "BERZERKER" comes to mind.  How
do they tell friend from foe when what they can _see_ is a 1cm area?  How
quickly do they advance from ready area to target?  What sort of ranges and
lifespans do they have?  I keep seeing DAVROS squeezing his fingers and
releasing the virus sized DALEKs to conquer the universe.  Such a universe
would be unplayable (RPG wise).

Blake\'s 7 required all transportees to carry a special device with them
which would allow the primary transporter to retrieve them.  Provided the
matter transporter was a transporter and not a destroy/rebuild type device
it should work.  Like having a one way doorway open up thus preventing the
transporter operator from "creating" several copies of the transportee.

This is difficult.  If it cost a LOT more to build the object this way then
it would be feasible to allow it to exist but its still open to a lot of
abuse.  Star Trek TNG seem to hint at some sort of utopian environment
within the Federation where the prime pursuit is knowledge and fulfilment
etc.  I think this is somehow used to allow their matter replicators to
exist without society collapsing.  Maybe if you tied Nano-Technology with
manufacturing you could get some sort of interesting replicator at the
molecular level.

There seems to be this conception in SF that if you take a tennis ball of
Anti-Matter and merge it with a tennis ball of normal matter then both
immediately destroy each other in a slugfest of radiation and energy.  I
don\'t think that would be the case.  The moment the first anti-atom and
normal-atom came in contact there would be a hugh amount of energy released
and the two objects would be flung apart.  The trick is to maintain the
contact.  In a total vacum in 1G gravity if you dropped an Anti-Matter
tennis ball on a normal-matter floor it would bounce (an awful lot) and
release hugh amounts of energy with each bounce.

Secondly, all those pebbles just burnt up in my planetary atmosphere like
small meteors do so Your Scout ship isn\'t as deadly as you thought 8-}.

Hmmm.  I had been thinking of each planet as a closed environment but if you
have to go to the trouble of replenishing from other sources wouldn\'t it be
cheaper to refuel directly from those sources in orbit or where ever?

[warning: the following article contains a graphic description of the
ballistic effects, if you\'ll pardon the pun, of laser weapons]

Scott Kellogg repeated one of the most oft-repeated and
least true beliefs about laser weapons: "You just wave
them around the target and burn them."  That\'s unfortunately
wrong, and here\'s why.

The concept of the "beam" laser is often thought to be the best
weapon by people who don\'t understand how laser weapons usually
damage a target.  It isn\'t.  Pulse lasers are much, much more
effective.  Presume you have two lasers, one beam, one pulse, that
put out the same amount of energy per second.  Say that this is about
oh say enough energy to boil 25 cm^3 of water.  Ok, the pulse laser hits
an human target, spends about 10% of its energy burning through the
clothes, and deposits a lot of energy fast in the first centimeter of
skin.  Bang, in addition to a burn you get impulsive damage as the
water vaporizes.  Not only do they hurt, but they likely fall over
stunned from the internal shock wave, not just damage.  They\'ve got
one cm^3 of flesh gone, the surrounding 10 cm^3 charred, and are
suffering from about the same impulsive damage as a pistol round.
Sound painful?  Would be...  Ok, hit someone
else with the beam laser.  Now, since the weapon isn\'t being held steady,
and the beam is continuous, its impact is spread around a bit.  This
means that more of its energy is disspated burning clothes.  Ok,
but we\'ve still got most of the energy.  Say that the beam wavered only a
quarter meter of total path during that second, and that most of the
energy still got through clothing.  Results?  A 25 cm long second
degree (maybe) burn, painful, but not necessarily even disabling.
Not convinced yet?  Armour the person a little bit.  Suddenly,
half the energy of the pulse is absorbed and doesn\'t get through, but
some does, still doing the same type of damage (if less).  On the
beam laser, since the beam is moving around, it never gets through
the armour.

Personally, I\'ll take a pulse laser.  Can you run it continously
at low-power mode to act as its own targeting aid?  Yes, sure, no problem
if you design it right.  Will firing it at the second it is held steady
on the target be easier than with a laser-sighted rifle or pistol? Nope.
Same problem, though you won\'t get recoil after you fire.

Enough lasers.  TNE wish list... umm ... umm... 8-)

Simplicate.  Try a quick character system for intro players.
(or, alternatively, include a few pages of sample characters...)
Combat, well, the T2k2/D20 system is reasonable, if you include the
explosive/antitank weapons lethality rule and apply it to (for instance)
plasma weapons.  DO A GOOD SYSTEM TO CONVERT MT CHARACTERS 8-)
Noncombat interactions:  Kick the T2k skills system a bit.
MT had a wonderful variety of USEFUL noncombat skills.  Don\'t lose
that.  Rescue the interstellar trade system from classic Traveller.
        Vehicle design: Seperate systems out, but make sure they\'re
compatable where they interact (you already were talking about that).
This allows some simplification.  Cull the rules that no longer make
sense (i.e. too much detail) from each resulting system.  Add reasonable
water and aircraft systems, though those can wait for a suppliment
(and I am willing to help with that, and the current systems do leave
enough room for improvement that starting over again might be good 8-)
Space Combat: High Guard was the high point.  It has gone
downhill since... try hard to retain elegant simplicity.  A slightly
more skill oriented HG variant might be just the thing...  Or, perhaps,
something based on the T2k vehicle system, with new orders of magnitude
of weapons (i.e., reasonable pen/damage values for space weapons, but
if you shoot a ground vehicle with one, multiply by 10 or something...
handle spinal weapons the same way: if you shoot something smaller than
10ktons with a spinal mount, multiply pen/damage by 10 (or whatever,
that\'s not the optimal point but you can probably get the idea).

The T2k2ed system has a lot going for it, mostly in a basic
simplicity of having evolved from a wargame.  Functionality can be
added without affecting that simplicity.   The Traveller background
is a good place to play with, even after the Hard Times.  It will
be challenging to play in.  Try hard to keep the quality level up
for the materials.  Help me convince more of these TML people
to put their pens/typewriters/word processors where their mouths are
(though that may be hard 8-).

Ok, that\'s my TNE wish list.  Have fun everybody 8-)

I\'ve been wondering what is going to happen to the lesser rules supplements
which found their way into the aggregated rules for Megatraveller. For
example .... Animal Encounters? Are GDW likely to provide Animal Encounters
a la Traveller/Megatraveller, which are complex and buggy, but in
combination with a judiciously written computer program can provide
a degree of "biodiversity" (ie lotsa animals). Or will it be like 2300AD
which seems slightly more realistic, but doesn\'t provide the referee with a
zooful of creatures? Or will these rules be there at all?

Also, it looks increasingly like the character generation rules, which many
people consider the one of the best things about the Traveller system (or at
least I do), will be replaced by the somewhat inferior one present in the
other GDW games. Question: does this include the horrible (again, my
opinion, maybe someone likes it) system for assigning motivation using
playing cards?

Now I don\'t own T2000, nor do I intend to ... I infer from skimming the T2000
stuff in Challenge that the character generation system is broadly similar
to 2300AD. Comparing 2300AD with Traveller, I generate a considerably less
complex NPC and then graft on as motivation out of nowhere, which generally
leaves him/her a lovesick psychotic, or a power mad hedonist, or ...

Way back in the early White Dwarf days, when Games Workshop licensed and
supported Traveller in the UK, there was an article on NPC generation,
which suggested a secondary character profile, 6 categories including
loyalty, ambition, etc. (can\'t remember them, I\'ll find it and post more
detail if there is interest). This produces a far better and more elegant
way of managing NPC interaction, especially in combination with the modern
task systems .. want to bribe an official? His/her loyalty rating is used
as a defensive mod on the task. It\'s also useful when one comes to generating
aliens - you can add default mods to their initial throw for the secondary
profile, and thereby ease the introduction of alien NPCs.

Otherwise, will there be a pack of playing cards in the TNE box?

Hmm... maybe not as brief as I\'d have liked. Couple of other points:

Wildstar\'s starport generator: in pre TNE days, and especially during Hard
Times, location within the Imperium (or indeed outside) would also be a
factor, how about plus mods for the Vilani main, Core sector, Massilia, etc?
Also, I would suggest taking out the "referee assigned" prosperity factor
and having it generated randomly at intervals, possibly on a subsector wide
basis, to simulate the effect of an economic cycle ("really this is a high
traffic world but the local economy is in a downturn").

Scott (so you\'re the Perot voter): re your cockpit guide. I think (for
humaniti at least) that manual control systems are more likely to change
with tech level than with locale, given that this should be the greatest
determinant of the level of automation. I would expect at the higher tech
levels that the control systems are more to do with telling the computers
what to do and how to do it, rather than with doing the task oneself. This
is of course up to the point where the transponders form their own union.

  as a power source.  According to one theory of universe creation,
  matter/antimatter pairs pop into existence in random intervals,
  such that if combined, the mass/antimass of each would sum to zero,
  (thus keeping the energy/mass totals in the universe constant).

Keeping with this theory, particle accelerators could be used to generate
  matter/antimatter fuel, but no great energy release would be produced
  other from the combination.  However, there is a potential for power
  storage.  If the antimatter fuel is energized (or the matter portion
  of the fuel), all of the energy would be released into the environment.
  I.e.  all of the energy used to raise the energy levels in the atoms
  annihilated would be available.  5 Mw-days could be released as
  7200 Mw for a duration of one minute.  In this system, advanced tech
  levels would still use fusion or other power sources to energize the
  fuel.

Of course, antimatter would still be usable for a weapon.  Releasing all
  of the energy stored in your enemy\'s hull will still release alot
  of damaging power.

Well, I\'ve only seen CHALLENGE 64\'s virus story so far and although it
hints at nasty things having happened it doesn\'t actually say bluntly
that the little silicon guys done it.

I read with interest the alternate cilicon virus posted in TML and it
made me shudder with fear.  If this is the future of TRAVELLER then
I for one will become anti-TECH and close all borders and go hide
in my cave (with a friend 8-}.

The second TML story about active computer AI running rampant through
the universe is more to my liking.

Personally, I think that provided GDW don\'t "set in concrete" that the
VIRUS was the prime cause for the downfall then I think there are a lot
of oportunities for GMs to play around the question of what really
happened.  I prefer to believe that the Zhodani woke something up on
their trip towards the core OR something else went wrong and the
current government line is that the VIRUS is the culprit.  Lots of
scope for the players to go find out what really happened.

Maybe the people of the IMPERIUM are just too proud to admit that they
caused the downfall and are blaming it on a rumour or some unrelated
facts.

I think that GDW should publish (or hint at) all these possibilities.
Don\'t set it in concrete.  Maybe several things happened that wiped
out separate parts of the Imperium while missing others.

RE: Matter Duplicators:

Has anyone ever read an old SF short about these aliens that thought they could
destroy the earth\'s economy by dropping a pair of duplicators on earth before
they invaded?

Of course the insatiable earthmen changed their economy from buying and selling
quantity to buying and selling diversity; IE instead of mass producing and
selling a thousand cars, you hand build a hundred different cars, and duplicate
the exact car that the customer wants!  Diversity became the goal instead of
mere substance.

Yep.  Most aircraft (all I\'ve ever heard of) which have the pilot and
co-pilot in tandem have the pilot on the left and the co-pilot on the
right.  (Sorry UK drivers! :-)  In such an arrangement, the throttle is
always center mounted allowing the co-pilot access to the throttle.
Thus the pilot flies left handed and uses his right hand for the
throttle.  The F-16 is an exception to this.  As it is a single seater,
it doesn\'t make much diff.  But all other fighters I know of have
the stick center mounted or on the left hand.  Pilots will usually
keep one hand always on the throttle.  Since that is the right hand,
you do all your flying left handed so that\'s where they put the stick.

Heck, no problem to a B-52 pilot.  B-52s (and presumably any Vilani
craft large enough) have steerable crosswind gear.  The can land (not
quite) sideways.  Crosswind gear on smaller aircraft are semi-fixed
casters.  When you are travelling at low speeds, they function like
regular fixed wheels.  At high speeds akin to making a landing on the
runway, they rotate out and act as casters.  It\'s tricky to get used
to, but not impossible.  (B-52s have been around a LONG time...)

Check out the Zhodani Alien module.  They pull the same trick with

Hell, it\'s psionic.  It isn\'t SUPPOSED to make sence!

The average Droyne ship doesn\'t employ too many humans.  If they did,
they would have to pay to have different controls put in.  They would
presumably have to do so for a pilot who\'d lost his wings somehow.

George talks about beam vs. pulse laser and makes some decent points.
Yes, pulse lasers do more damage than beam lasers.  But Usually,
pulse lasers pulse in the kilohertz range.  This, to the human eye
makes it basically perform as a beam laser.  The reason more damage
is done is manly not for the arguments you make, but because, when a
powerful laser hits a target, it vaporizes the first layer of what it
hits.  That vapor (metal, water whatever) forms a cloud around what
has been hit.  That cloud reflects and refracts the beam of the laser.
A pulse timing allows the cloud to disapate so that the laser can
burn off the next layer of the target.

George\'s discription of a pulse laser is more along the lines of
one large pulse.  Over a short amount of time rather than over a
continuous beam.  Thus all the energy of the beam arrives at one
short interval (& small location)  This is akin to having a large
laser and turning the power up and down when it is on target.
The same pulse laser he describes should be able to be turned on
as a continuous pulse laser of a higher power draw, (with attendant
cooling problems) & it would drain the battery faster.

Now, beam or pulse (which ever you wanna call it)  A beam could
easily be expanded to attack a persons eyes.  It would be the
most common laser injury.  Imagine:  A laser weapon with a 1Kw beam
with a beam radius of 1 mm.  Zap!
Ok, as the beam is expanded, the power will drop off as 1/r^2.
So...  a beam with a 100 mm beam would have a localized beam strength
of .1 watt.  100mw.  Now a 100 mw beam is quite sufficient to cause
severe retinal damage (I\'m pretty sure 100mw is a class 4 laser).
I got hit with far less power than that.  (Thank GOD!)
But your beam is now 20 centimeters in diameter.  That\'s like a small
flashlight.  It\'s pretty *hard* to miss with something like that.

Hm... I know little about lasers, but from what I\'ve heard,
and from some of the details of the previous post, I think you\'re a
little off here.

A beam laser is very "accurate" in the sense of actually making a
connection with the target, but obviously will cut a swath rather than
drilling a hole.

Game system check: I don\'t archive TML digests, but I believe
the previous poster mentioned drilling through a 7cm metal plate or
something.  I\'m probably way off with the numbers, but I definitely
got the impression that the average traveller laser weapon has more
power than boiling twenty-five cubic centimeters of water in one
second.

> [discussion of a pulse laser vaporizing a cubic centimeter
> of flesh deleted]

Note that the laser probably has to be "tuned" to flesh, to a
degree, to get maximum wound potential.  This would also tend to trade
off on effectiveness vs. armor.  It could be tuned the other way, of
course (armor-piercing lasers anybody? :-)

You\'re making some assumptions about the time compression
factor here.  You stated before, each puts out enough energy to boil
25cm^3 in one second.  Here you\'ve moved to the assumption that the
pulse laser puts it out all in one fraction of a second.  This is
reasonable, but make it clear...  What fraction of a second?  1/10?
So now you have a pulse laser with 10 times the intensity vs a beam
laser with 10 times the duration.

This is something I always found really silly about classic
traveller, the lack of a built-in "targeting" laser on a beam laser.
On a pulse-laser, on the other hand, you\'re probably going to need a
separate laser for targeting.

> Will firing it at the second it is held steady on the target

> Same problem, though you won\'t get recoil after you fire.

Yes and no.  I have a friend who sells firearms for a living
and is seriously into them as a hobby, who likes to say that no
marksman is more accurate than the weapon.  Taken another way, no
weapon is less accurate than the marksman firing it.  Obviously there
are exceptions - for example extreme long range - but it generally
holds true that a well built and maintained firearm will cause a very
small fraction of deviation from the target, compared to the marksman.

So a laser, being more accurate, still has to deal with the
steadiness of the user\'s hand, the hand-eye coordination for
targeting, etc.

On the other hand, a laser has no recoil, and gives a
perfectly flat and straight beam.  This makes it excellent at long
ranges by comparison, and probably makes it somewhat better at shorter
ranges, particularly (in both cases) where repeating fire is used (no
adjusting for recoil).

A comment on the difficulty of evading a laser, remarked upon
by the previous poster.  Try playing paintball, a combat-style game
using CO2-propelled, paint-filled gelatin capsules.  These capsules
move at just under 300 feet per second (if they move any faster, don\'t
play, it\'s unsafe).  MUCH slower than, say, a 9mm pistol round.
Should be rather easy to evade, eh?  Have fun.  Make sure your clothes
are old ones you won\'t worry about getting paint on.

Although it is *barely* possible to see a paintball coming and
duck it (easiest at long range), it is much harder than you might
think.  With paintballs, as with bullets and lasers, the best way to
dodge them is to not be there.

And, at close range, your attacker will get a shot at you
quite a bit before you can get behind some cover.  The main thing that
keeps these games going as long as they do (which isn\'t that long) is
the relative inaccuracy of the paintball guns, and the tendencies
among players to sneak up from behind cover and/or pop away at each
other from extreme ranges forever.

Figure it out.  At TL-10, the best we can do is Jump-1; which requires 10%
of ship tonnage as fuel; at TL-12 we can make Jump-3 at a cost of 20%.  If
we assume drop tanks to make the initial jump then at TL-10 we will need
70% of the ship volume for jump fuel.  At TL-12, we can do it with 35% of
the ship volume as jump fuel.

I will agree, however, that the original Sword Worlders probably didn\'t
cross through the rift.  It makes much more sense for them to wander around
and through Corridor to get to the Marches.  As to why they went coreward
and then spinward, who knows?  Perhaps their only avenue of escape from
their enemies was to coreward, and they kept on running until they got to
the Vilani.  Stopping long enough to ask directions, they set out in a
direction that the Vilani had not explored (through Corridor and into the
Marches).  They then looked around until they found what they wanted.

Wouldn\'t change it too much?  Heck, no!  It would be like a return to the
"good old days".  Back when I started playing Traveller, the Paranoia Press
suppliments were hot stuff (especially "Scouts and Assasins") and several
starships in the campaign had Delta Research LHeP(Or) computer systems with
the full artificial personality package.  Including one Model/9-fib that

Yes, and in my opinion, the tech level chart is in serious need of
revision.  Practical antimatter technology is currently no further away
than fusion power (and may be closer, depending on who you talk to).  It
might make sense to introduce antimatter at the same TL as fusion; fusion
for the large power plants, and antimatter as a smaller portable power
source.

With Hard Times and the Short Nap, technology levels are likely to get even
more confused.  The collapse of interstellar trade may take away some of
the capability, but not the knowledge: technology which can be produced
locally will be maintained.  This will lead to strange cases where some
facet of local technology is one or more tech levels higher than everything
else.

Did they try giving you another binocular/laser so that you could "shoot

> Solomani and most Imperial flight controls generally consist

It was quite a while ago, but when I designed the Gold of Zurrian, I was
told (and this was "official" information at the time) that most Imperial
vessels used the *VILANI* conventions, not the Solomani.  I don\'t believe
this has changed.

Let me expand this a little bit.  In the Solomani tradition, vessels that
require more than pilot use side-by-side seating, with the co-pilot on
the right.  The throttles are typically placed between the pilots, and the
control stick is in the center of each console.  If side-sticks are used,
they will be on the opposite side from the throttles.

If there is only one pilot, then the throttles may be on either side,
depending on the whim of the designer; I believe that a left-side placement
is more common, because most Solomani are right-handed, and will want to
use their right hands for the control stick.  For the same reason, a side
mounted control stick will usually be on the right (this was certainly the
case of the F-18 cockpit mockup that I "flew" a number of years ago).

A craft with one pilot but other crewmembers (such as a navigator, weapons
systems operator, etc) may have a side-by-side arrangement, but a
fore-and-aft arrangement is at least as common.

Side-mounted sticks are usually force-sensitive, whereas center sticks are
not.  Moving a "normal" control stick causes the control surfaces to move
or the maneuvering thrusters to fire.  The more you move the stick, the
more control forces are applied to the craft; centering the stick causes
the control forces to cease (the stick should center itself if the pilot
lets go).  A force-sensitive stick does not actually move much (if at all).
Pushing, pulling, or pressing the stick from sided to side causes the
control surfaces to move or the maneuvering thrusters to fire.  The harder
you press, the more control forces are applied to the craft; letting go
causes the control forces to cease.  The "feel" of a force-sensitive stick
is very different from that of conventional controls.  Since the stick
doesn\'t move, there is an initial tendancy to over-control and press too
hard.  It is very easy to get the hang of, and is probably more sensitive
to small control inputs that a conventional stick.

I think this sounds like a very Vilani thing to do.  Since the Vilani
design philosophy is more common in the Imperium, this would explain why
anyone with "Pilot" skill can fly anything from a Scoutship up to the
largest warship or transport.  It also explains the skill cross over
between air/raft, ship\'s boat, and pilot skills.

No, you don\'t let the wheels swivel freely like on a Adrian Hurt\'s shopping
trolley.  Modern-day crosswind gear is powered (hydraulically or
electrically), so that the pilot selects the crosswind angle with a cockpit
control, and the main gear swivels to match.  After you are down, you dial
it back to zero, and use a little steering wheel to steer the nosewheel.
This is the sort of system that is used on modern large transports (just
about everything since the Boeing 707).  No problem with high speed taxi.

I\'m not convinced with this one, but it makes for a good story!

This was tried in early human flight experiments (strapping the pilot
into a yoke and having him lean to control yaw motion).  This was
abandonded as ineffective, but it would be like the K\'kree to stick
with the first system they thought of.

Presumably if anybody could do it, the Zhodani could.  Perhaps the fighter
controls only respond to somebody sitting nearby, or maybe you have to
flick a special control when you start up the system, so that the computer
can store the pilot\'s mental pattern (flick-print?).  From then on until
flick control is turned off, the computer only responds to inputs from
the person with the right mental pattern.

If processed by a starship fuel purifier, I presume that the salts and

I\'ve always assumed that it was liquid (probably under relatively high

The problem is that there needs to be a quick and easy "memory handle" to
explain TLs to new people.  Relating a TL to a historical date fills the
bill (but it also leads to inaccuracies).  The TL chart could definitely
stand to be re-thought, but whatever the end result is, players and
referees will immediately start comparing it to historical developments.

It is at least related to current research.  One possible problem is that I
personally find it difficult to believe that there is any unified computer
architecture throughout the Imperium, let alone with other interstellar
states.  The virus is going to have to be able to "port" itself from
operating system to operating system, running on radically different types
of hardware.

Any version of the story that ends with the dawn of the "New Era" will have
approximately the same role-playing potential.  The virus is a plot device
which allows us to go from Hard Times to the New Era.  The more consistent
and believable the plot device, the better the connection.  A good plot
device should allow other writers to extrapolate things that the creator
did not intend, but are nevertheless consistent, interesting, and playable.

WWI did not permanently damage civilization on a worldwide basis.  The
"Short Nap" - the intervening 70 years - seems to me more like the time
between the fall of Rome and the rise of Charlemagne.  And probably the
light of civilization brought by the Star Vikings of the New Era will be
about as permanent as the Holy Roman Empire of Charlemagne.  Brilliant
conquerors will re-unite much of what was the old Imperium, but these new
empires will probably not last beyond their founders\' lifetimes.

Just a curious question: is MegaTraveller your first exposure to Traveller?

The reason I ask is that just about everything you mention was available
for Classic Traveller.  The task system was introduced by Digest Group
Publications as an add-on to Classic Traveller.  A vector movement system
was included with the basic Traveller set, and another was available in the
Mayday boardgame.  High Guard provided a ship combat and ship design system
that worked.  World/System generation was available in the form of DGP\'s
Grand Survey and Grand Census in combination with the Scouts rulebook.  We
created a workable personal combat system out of Striker by adding in the
task system and a few rules of our own.

The way MegaTraveller was sold to me was as a way to combine, edit, and
generally clean up a mishmash of rules that required you to have 6 or 8
rulebooks, at least 3 suppliments (the two library data, plus the sector of
your choice), an adventure (Trillion Credit Squadron), and a couple of
boardgames (Mayday and Striker), plus a bunch of third-party products.

Instead, we got something which required you to be familliar with all of
that which I just mentioned, on top of which you got a bunch of all-new
errata, a dead emperor, and we were expected to buy more stuff (like the
Referee\'s Companion, the Rebellion Sourcebook, and COACC) to get back to
where we started from.  Plus we still had to refer to the Classic Traveller
material in order to find and fix errors.

I agree; the task system is the best feature in MT.  The conversion to
T2k2 rules bothers me a little, because I don\'t feel that it is as easy
and as intuitive as the current task system in MegaTraveller.  Then again,
this could just be my inexperience with the T2k2 system.  This is one reason

One of the major problems is that most players and referees do not have a
computer available for this sort of work.  Here is definitely a case where
TML members are in the minority.

I don\'t have as much time invested in the current system.  I have a
computer spreadsheet that I use to create vessel designs; the spreadsheet
wasn\'t hard to create, and hides most of the problems with the system from
me, as I suspect your computer program does for you.  I am willing to
discard my existing designs if the new design system is an improvement over
the old one.  One of my reasons is that an improved system should make it
easier and faster to re-create the designs if need be than it was to create
them in the first place.

The current level of detail is OK, although if this level of detail
remains, then many systems should be examined for significance.  In other
words, should I really have to list an item costing Cr 150 in a ship design
that costs over Cr 1,000,000,000?  The major problem, however, has to do
with circular calculations.  There are a number of these in the current
design sequence (where one calculation depends on the result of another
which indirectly depends on the result of the first).  One that causes
frequent problems is agility, which depends on ship mass, which in turn
depends in part on the size of the power plant, which depends on the power
required to achieve the agility design goal.

I would support this idea.  A "basic" design system where ships are
constructed by assembling a small number of standard "modules" into
different configurations (much like the original Classic Traveller starship
design rules), and another where the designer has complete control over
every aspect of the design (and can even generate new "modules" for the
basic design system,).  I feel that if these two systems were designed and
playtested at the same time, they could be made completely compatible, so
that the designs would work together well without even the sort of
differences as was present between Book 2 and High Guard.

There are also problems with the sensor rules.  As written, a ship with
only one battery (like a scoutship or most armed merchants) cannot fire at
a moving target.  The distinction (in terms of data gathered) between
active and passive sensors is also lost.  I believe I have a proposed fix
for those problems around here somewhere ...

I have successfully used this gimmic in other role-playing games.  With
proper limitations, it does not become too powerful; but as a general
rule, its not a good idea.

Player characters, should they get their hands on one, can use the thing
for painless, risk-free insertions and extractions ("Beam me up, Scotty!
They\'re about to kill me!").  This is definitely not a good idea, unless
they need this advantage to overcome an unending horde of enemies (like on
"Avon\'s 5"), or if it is a strictly controlled plot device (ala Star Trek).

The problem with this theory is that the separation would not be instant.
In the intervening time, many more atoms would annihilate, releasing even
more energy.  More than enough to vaporize the antimatter and a good deal of
the nearby matter.  As the gas clouds mix, more matter and antimatter will
annihilate, releasing more energy.

Nope, just one big bang; probably worth several dozen kilotons of TNT
(maybe more; I\'m not sure), and a lot of matter and antimatter atoms blown
to escape velocity.  Any sort of containment at all would increase the
mixing and therefore the ultimate yeild.

That\'s just as bad; they still deposit the thermal energy into the
planetary atmosphere.  Given the speed of the pebbles, they will probably
penetrate a respectable distance (maybe even to the surface; I don\'t know)
into the atmosphere; the effect will be not unlike a nuclear airburst as
the pebble dumps its energy.  This was discussed in great depth a while ago
on TML; check the archives.


gwh@lurnix.COM (George William Herbert) writes:
> [about laser "ballistics" - good work!]

From some things I have read, I note that as the laser power increases,
damage efficency decreases.  This is because the laser pulse initially
heats what it has hit until it vaporises.  The light pressure from the
laser holds the vapor in; it can\'t expand much until the pulse ends.  After
this point, additional energy in the pulse serves mainly to superheat the
vapor (if made hot enough, the vapor will expand despite the light
pressure, scattering the beam and carrying energy away from the site of the
laser strike).  Double the energy at this point, and you get much less than
double the damage.  You may be able to increase the area of the laser beam,
and heat the vapor more (resulting in a bigger bang), but if the beam isn\'t
penetrating the armor plate, then the increased energy isn\'t doing any
good.

However, if the energy is increased by firing a train of pulses in quick
succession (fast enough that the target does not appreciably move in the
time from the first pulse to the last) then something interesting happens.
As each pulse ends, the resultant vapor gets a chance to expand.  The
following pulse starts vaporizing material at the bottom of the "pit" dug
by the previous pulse.  The result is a laser that will penetrate thicker
armor plate.

How about character templates like the Space: 1889 or Star Wars systems?  I
wouldn\'t want these as the only options for TNE character generation, but
it would be a good alternative to the normal character generation system
for first time players.  Some guidelines for referees, so we can create our
own templates might be a good idea, too.

I suggest putting the equipment lists and the players\' version of the
background data into the players\' manual (kind of like the character
generation and task system portions of the MT Players\' Handbook combined
with the equipment lists and some of the background data from the Imperial
Encyclopedia).  The reason is so that players can actually use the players\'
manual on an ongoing basis.  One problem with the way that MT was organized
was that the players needed access to the Players\' Manual and the Imperial
Encyclopedia (but shouldn\'t be allowed access to other parts of the
Imperial Encyclopedia), while the referee needed access to all three books.

> DO A GOOD SYSTEM TO CONVERT MT CHARACTERS 8-)

Definitely.  Without that being available to every Traveller player that
picks up the TNE box, you may as well not call it Traveller at all.  GDW
may not want to take up space in the rulebooks with this.  A special
edition of "Imperial Lines" (or something similar) could talk about
character conversion and about bringing Classic or Mega Traveller
characters into the New Era.  This could be included in every box of the
first printing, and bound into Challenge at some point.  Such a conversion
system will probably mean importing many of the MT skills into the T2k2
system; losing skills in the conversion would be very bad; therefore, I
agree with the skill list suggestion.  I also agree with George\'s comments
about the trade system, vehicle design, and space combat.

Quality control is a must.  GDW\'s reputation in general, and Traveller\'s in
particular, took a rather heavy beating from MegaTraveller.  To drop the
ball again might well cost GDW the game.

Don\'t expect a group effort from TML; we\'re too much of an anarchy to do
that.  On the other hand, getting individuals to contribute may not be
as difficult as you might think.

I still chuckle about that one.  Obviously, someone at GDW has studied the

I was just thinking about that; try this on for size:

For Hard Times: -3 in Wilds, -2 in Outlands, -1 in Frontier, +0 in Safe.
                +1 if a member of a polity (in the Outlands or Wilds; this
                   DM does not apply to worlds in a faction\'s Safe).

Extra-Imperial Worlds: -2 for Non-Aligned, -1 for Client States
Extra-Imperial Polities: +0 (assumed to have their own internal economy)

The +1 for "designated trade route" can be applied to Hard Times as well as
to xboat and other trade routes in a stable interstellar state.  You could
even apply it to any well known and well-travelled mains, like the Vilani
Main and the Spinward Main.  It should definitely be applied to trade
"runs" like those described in the Diaspora sector.

The trading partners rule works out the DM for worlds that are on mains.
If a world is on a main it gets at least a +2 (one for each neihbor world)
and more if either of them have an A or B starport.

I preferred the referee assigned prosperity factor instead of a random one,
so that the referee could decide where and when to apply it.  If you want a
world that has a depressed local economy, simply (and arbitrarily; it\'s OK)
apply the -4 DM (or even more, if you feel like it).  Use this DM to paint
entire sectors as a heavily industrialized core, or to pick out individual
subsectors, clusters or even single worlds for deep depression or
spectacular productivity.

For extra-imperial explorations, the referee should probably look into
matters carefully; completely unexplored areas probably have no trade at
all.  The referee may want to compute the trade volume anyway; this could
be the world\'s "potential trade value" or some such.  Any independent
states out there should probably have a prosperity level assigned and local
trade generated.

I still think that this is a nice idea for aircraft/vehicles & early
spacecraft, but mid-to-high tech spacecraft probably have cockpits that
look like the starship Enterprise or the Battlestar Galactica\'s.  And the
pilot probably operates them by saying, "Beowulf, calculate and execute
insertion into a 1600 km parking orbit" or somesuch.  Point being that the
computer probably handles the actual details of maneuvering for anything
bigger than an air/raft.

But of course!  This makes things interesting... As referee, my job
isn\'t to adjudicate things so Imperial citizens don\'t have to make tricky
moral choices ... it\'s to make things interesting/entertaining/enjoyable.
Will A.I.s help do that?  I think so, both in respect to themselves, and in
respect to society\'s reaction/adaptation to them.

So you\'ve got worlds that were unaffected by the "virus" that still
use robotic technology, and worlds where everybody has a pretty severe
"Frankenstein complex".  Some worlds might have had a Luddite reaction
to ALL hi-tech -- remember Andre Norton\'s "The Stars are Ours", where
the "Scientists" were blamed for the Big One, and anyone showing signs
of being educated was persecuted as an "evil" Scientist?

What is TravCom2, well it is an attempt to integrate both Classic Traveller

written in ARexx at the present time. That will read sector data and
create random passengers, Freight and Cargo with variable pricing.

For those of you who wish to look at the system I am looking for BETA
testers. Since the program is presently only in ARexx, Amiga owners with
ARexx are the first guinea pigs.

There are plans to port this to both Rexx, this should be easy, for OS/2
and QBasic, when I get the time, if there is enough interest.

Anyone who is interested let me know.

Features include:

Reading the GEnie Sector data for system information. You can enter
either the name of the system or the Sector Hex number.

Output to file or screen

A separate program to create Purchase and Sale forms.

Variable pricing per item ala Classic Traveller, so that a ton of
steel does not cost the same as a ton of diamonds. Also there are
trade modifiers.

Multiple Destinations, so a GM will have a set of cargos rather
than running the program multiple times.

Where is the tennis ball going to go that it won\'t come in contact
with matter?  And why is all the antimatter going to stay together in
one lump with all this energy floating around?  At 300 K the avewrage
speed of these molecules will be somewhere around 10000 m/s this means
that the average number of collisions on one cm^2 will be on the order
of 10^25 collisions per second.  Each colission releases about 10^-10
J for a 10^15 Watt power output.  (back of envelope calculations,
subject to gross inaccuracies, but I can\'t be *that* far off).

What you would probably get is an expanding plasma cloud of antimatter
with a hot boundary where the antimatter is overtaking the matter.
Basically a big explosion....

Small normal meteors travel at considerably slower speeds and
therefore don\'t burn quite so hot (like A-Bomb+ temps) when they burn
up in your atmosphere...

This example sucks, because the TL14 world has *nothing* to sell to
the TL15 world.  But if the cost to make food decreases by 5% per tech
level and the cost to make tractors decreased by 15% per tech level
then the two worlds will trade.  TL14 world makes food at cr20000/ton

volumes needed are not equal, but you get the point.)

two DESIGNS.  Out of perhaps 100.  The smaller is a five thousand-tonner,
the larger is a 20,000+ tonner.  There are about 50 samples of the two
designs present.
In addition, there are perhaps 300 other ships (five or so designs) that
could cross the rift with a little advance preparation.  All these other
300 were MUCH larger.

Assuming that the larger rift-crosser (it isn\'t actually used for that, but
could do it), and assuming you were in no special hurry, you could carry
16,000T of useful cargo from the one side to the other, going through any
area in the rift with a Jump-8 path, or better.  Cut that to 10,000T if you
only have a J-10 route.  This would require 25,000T of drop tanks for each
J-8 (or J-10) transit.  Do that four times, and you are across the rift.
So that makes a cost of MCr100 for the tanks (plus, of course, the
machinery required to build tanks when you reach a system) to move 16,000T.
Cr6250 per ton moved.  Cr 3125 per person in low berth.  What\'s the big deal?


>The other problem is that as my reference to crossing of Reft and the

The Aslan have been crossing the rift for about a thousand years.  Not my
definition of "recent".

 It means that GDW pays for Internet access...we don\'t have a university
 or a megacorp to pick up the tab. Actually, since its going to my private
 GEnie account, it means that _I_ am paying for the privilege of seeing
 TML (we\'ll see if Frank OKs the voucher I turn in).

 To the TML at large: Perhaps I should explain a couple of
 things...all BBS connections I do for GDW are done on my home
 machine, after working hours. The office phone lines are too noisy
 for a modem (and the phone company seems unable to fix that without
 large infusions of money). This all comes out of my so-called "free
 time." Only on rare occasions does Frank Chadwick or anyone else from
 GDW actually lay hands on my keyboard. All of the material people ask
 to be forwarded to them is transferred to disk or printed out and shoved
 under their respective noses.

 I get Biweekly TML delivery, so I won\'t be posting more than once or
 twice a week, although I\'ll try to answer Email letters faster.

 ******************

 Steve Higginbotham, Mike Metlay, Mark Watson, Lewis Taylor Goss,
 your notes have been given to Frank Chadwick and David Nilsen, as
 requested.

 ******************

 To Mike (the Rantmeister? ;- ) Metlay:

 I decided to sign up for TML acess after numerous individuals here
 strongly encouraged me to do so. I\'m pretty thick-skinned (and I can
 curse in four languages if the situation warrants), but I see no point
 in carrying on endless "Oh Yeah, well you\'re another!" exchanges (they
 get in the way of free discussion).

 Let me clarify one final point: If somebody says a game I produce is a
 piece of crap, I can live with that (it happens often
 enough)...that\'s a matter of personal taste. If, however, somebody
 calls me an idiot, or says that GDW employees are totally lacking in
 brain cells, I see that as a personnal attack. I\'ll try not to engage
 in personal attacks, and I hope others will do the same.

 Rob Dean:
 One brief question for GDW, if you don\'t mind my asking--what sort of
 numbers are we expecting for common Traveller weapons in TNE?  Say, a
 laser carbine and a gauss rifle as examples.

 Good question. I haven\'t completely worked them out yet. This is a
 rather complicated undertaking, since bullet weight, muzzle velocity,
 and the other factors needed for the rating equation is not readily
 available for some of the Traveller weapons. Energy weapons are
 also a problem, as no rating formula has been worked up yet. There _is_
 a laser carbine rated in Dark Conspiracy, representing a primitive weapon
 with a back-pack power unit. I suspect that the ratings for the plasma guns
 and the like will prove to be deadly enough for you.

LA Times  Friday, October 30, 1992

  Tiny electrodes implanted in a blind woman\'s brain allowed her to "see"
distinct dots of light- a method that may produce an artificial vision device
in several years, doctors said Thursday.
  The experiment "gives us firm evidence that artificial vision for the blinded
person is an achievable goal, hopefully before the end of the decade," said Dr.
Murray Goldstein, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke.
  "Our initial goal is to develop a stadium scoreboard type of display so they
could read printed material and recognize street signs," navigate through
doorways and avoid obstacles, said Dr. Terry Hambrecht, an institute physician.
  The government experiment, part of a 20-year, $10-million research effort,
was revealed during the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.  It was
kept secret because "we didn\'t want to spread false hope if the experiment
failed," Goldstein said.
  The experiment on the 42-year-old blind woman started when she underwent
surgery in November, 1991, at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center
in Bethesda, Md.  The woman, a volunteer whose identity was not disclosed, lost
her eyesight due to glaucoma 20 years ago, Hambrecht said.
  During her operation, Drs. Conrad Kufta and Daniel O\'Rourke removed a
1-by-2-inch section of her skull and implanted 38 "micro-electrodes" into her
visual cortex, the part of the brain that receives signals from the eyes.
  Tiny gold wires attached to each electrode protruded from her skull.  When
electric currents were applied to the wires, 34 of the 38 electrodes worked,
allowing her to "see" 34 dots of blue, purple, red and yellow light that ranged
from the size of a pinhead to the size of a nickel held at arms length and that
could be adjusted in brightness.
  Hambrecht and other researchers mapped where each electrode produced a dot in
the woman\'s perceived field of vision.  That let them apply current to four
electrodes so the woman could "see" the letter I, he said.
  Eventually, scientists envision a device that would include a miniature
television camera attached to eyeglasses frames:  The TV picture of a blind
person\'s surroundings would be sent to electrodes permanently implanted in the
brain and the user would experience the sensation of seeing a picture made up
of 250 to 1000 spots of light.

****End of Included Text****
  While I found this fascinating, the AP leaves a bit to be desired in terms of
references.  I searched Medline but found no reference to this experiment,
although I did find some of Kufta and O\'Rourke\'s previous papers.  If anyone
hears anything else about this could you let me know?
  Another item they neglected to mention was how long the electrodes stayed
implanted and continued working.  I was always under the impression that this
was one of the most difficult parts about directly stimulating nerve cells:
they tend to die off.

  What does this have to do with Traveller?  Well...It\'s late and I thought
some of our more cyber-ish players out there might find it interesting, and
it\'s late...

Yeah, voice control is nice, and possible.  The books I\'ve read on cockpit
design talk about voice control & the possiblilities.  But for quick
control inputs (attack, evasion, landing) where piloting skill comes into
effect, you want that control stick.  I can move my left hand a LOT faster
than I can say "Break right!  Come to course zero nine five!"  I can make
my right hand move a lot faster than I can say "Full throttle!"
Ever play with a flight simulator?  Say like Wing Commander?  Imagine
trying to give all the control input\'s verbally...
Yes, the computer Does all the maneuvering, and not just for
air/rafts:  air/rafts have computers too.  But the control INPUT is from
a stick.

Remember that most of the high performance starships have the same maneuver
capabilities as the fighters.  As such they can perform the same maneuvers
and will require the same control inputs.

If all is voice controlled, then where does piloting control come in?
Why a dexterity bonus?  (Unless the pilot is a stutterer...  :-)

}back" every once and a while?  I bet having to worry about *THAT* might
}spoil someone\'s aim pretty quick!

No.  I was 100 yards away without an extension cord.  But the point is
that that binocular/laser thing was about as clumsy a weapon arrangement
as you can imagine.  Picture this:  A pair of binoculars with a brick
attached.  No pistol grip, no rifle stock, just something you can barely
wrap both hands around to keep it from falling apart.  Now, I\'m no
marksmen, (I fired a .22 ONCE *In the dark*) but I believe 100 yards is
pretty much outside pistol range.  Yet this clumsy thing was deadly
accurate.  At pistol range it would have been even better.

Me:

Wildstar:
}It was quite a while ago, but when I designed the Gold of Zurrian, I was
}told (and this was "official" information at the time) that most Imperial
}vessels used the *VILANI* conventions, not the Solomani.  I don\'t believe
}this has changed.

Where did you read this?  It kinda makes sence, even fitting with my
estimate, but where did it come from?  The Vilani setup I described
would be a lot easier to handle than the Solomani one with rudder pedals
if your feet were of the wrong configuration.  PLEASE tell me where you
read this.  I didn\'t know anybody else thought about stuff like this.

Me:
> The stick is usually

Wildstar:
}If there is only one pilot, then the throttles may be on either side,
}depending on the whim of the designer; I believe that a left-side placement
}is more common, because most Solomani are right-handed, and will want to
}use their right hands for the control stick.  For the same reason, a side
}mounted control stick will usually be on the right (this was certainly the
}case of the F-18 cockpit mockup that I "flew" a number of years ago).

Most aircraft I know of, (where I\'ve seen the cockpit) have a right hand
throttle.  I know the F-16 has a left hand throttle, and your testimony
for the F-18, but an F-14 pilot friend told me that that was the exception
not the rule.  I guess the Solomani of Trav will probably have both left
and right side sticks.

Me: (On Vilani)
> the same control panel exists on a Vilani fat trader as exists

}I think this sounds like a very Vilani thing to do.  Since the Vilani
}design philosophy is more common in the Imperium, this would explain why
}anyone with "Pilot" skill can fly anything from a Scoutship up to the
}largest warship or transport.  It also explains the skill cross over
}between air/raft, ship\'s boat, and pilot skills.

MMM.  After all, what Vilani pilot will want to have to understand
all that technical stuff behind the control panel?
"When this light turns red:  That is very bad."
"What if the light is in a different spot on the panel?"
"It won\'t be."

}No, you don\'t let the wheels swivel freely like on a Adrian Hurt\'s shopping
}trolley.  Modern-day crosswind gear is powered (hydraulically or
}electrically), so that the pilot selects the crosswind angle with a cockpit
}control, and the main gear swivels to match.  After you are down, you dial
}it back to zero, and use a little steering wheel to steer the nosewheel.
}This is the sort of system that is used on modern large transports (just
}about everything since the Boeing 707).  No problem with high speed taxi.

Yeah yer right, but small aircraft don\'t have powered crosswind gear.
So Vilani, (taught as generically as possible) will have to be taught
DO NOT TAXI TOO FAST!  There\'s probably a governer in the computer
somewhere.

> [Droyne controls]
}I\'m not convinced with this one, but it makes for a good story!

Well, before I ran outta money, I learned quite a bit as a student pilot.
One of the things I kept wishing for was more appendages, and an instict
for things like angles of attack, bank etc.  If I had wings and the
corresponding insticnt (even if it\'s vestigial) flying would be a LOT
easier.  After all, the earliest droyne flying machines
are basically gonna be mechanical versions of their wings.  Seems to me
that a mechanical linkage would be the easiest way to maintain control.
Why use your hands (which don\'t know how to fly) when your wings are just
as good (or better) and free up your hands to operate more secondary
controls.
I can imagine that the Droyne might install some large fans over the
pilot\'s station to give him a \'feel\' for the way the ship or plane is
performing.  He could feel a stall building up by the airflow over his
wings inside the cockpit.
(I wonder what it\'ll be like when the Alcyon crew gets a load
of the Bernoulli\'s cockpit  :-)

Me: (on K\'Kree)
> The pilot lies in a couch arrangement with his

Wildstar:
}This was tried in early human flight experiments (strapping the pilot
}into a yoke and having him lean to control yaw motion).  This was
}abandonded as ineffective, but it would be like the K\'kree to stick
}with the first system they thought of.

:-)  Now you got the idea!  When an alien has all those extra appendages,
USE \'EM!

Wildstar:
}References: "Jet-Age Test Pilot" (Tex Johnston\'s autobiography, published

I\'d also recomend "Future Fighters" (Salamander books, I forget the author)
(M. Spinks?)

}Visit the National Air and Space Museum.

Have done many times.
Hey, Wildstar, go to Garber Flight Restoration Facility in Silver Hill.
Call in advance & find out when my brother Jim is giving a tour of the
hangers.  He\'s a docent on weekends.  :-)

Hi,

I\'ve got some old Traveller stuff that I\'d like to get rid off. So
I would like to auction it off. All the stuff is in Good to Excellent
shape. Good meaning that covers are a bit scruffy and I might have
written inside with a pencil. Excellent, meaning like new or very close
to it. The minimum bid is $2.50 for the small books and $5.00 for the
larger ones. These items are all by GDW for Traveller.

>Just a curious question: is MegaTraveller your first exposure to Traveller?

No, actually.  I started with Classic Traveller, although nothing like
as seriously as my current campaign.  I did not, however, equip myself
with quite as many supplements as most of the TML: I did not get
Mayday, Striker, TCS, or any of the Digest Group stuff -- I suspect
the DGP material was perhaps less readily available in England as in
the USA.  My first introduction to the task system was therefore in
MegaTraveller.

On ship design:

>The major problem, however, has to do with circular calculations.

They\'re not really circular, they are mutually interdependent.  As I
implemented it, you can change the power plant output and the agility
will be adjusted; you can change the agility and it will find the
power plant size by iteration.

The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of a two-level
design system.  I could really use a quick method of generating
designs in addition to the detailed one.  If GDW wanted to keep the
basic rules simple, a _Starship Operators Manual_ with the complex
design rules.

Your point about most players not having a computer is something that
has actually been brought home fairly heavily.  My programme was
written for an NCR Decision Mate V and although it ran MS-DOS on an
8088 the screen control characters were not exactly compatible with my
new IBM-clone PC -- I am faced with the prospect of a hurried porting
job in my copious spare time (hah!) and hoping the old compiler runs
on the new machine.  Meanwhile, I\'m looking through the vehicle archives...

Now what I could *really* use is a Computer-Aided deck plan layout
system, preferably integrated with the design parameter system so I
could do everythign at once.  The characters in my campaign are far
too keen on boarding inoperative ships...

economic depressions, loss of industrial base, some loss of population base...
They might provide a model for the Hard Times/Short Nap milieux.  Post-WWI
Europe (or post-100 Years War Europe) was splintered into a number of
economically damaged but independent states that were ripe for "any man on
a horse" to come along and "save" them.  I expect to see a similar situation
early in the "Short Nap" -- small polities ruled by dictators trying to
conquer their neighbors as a way of improving the situation at home (or
taking the populace\'s minds off their own problems).
        Contrariwise, the South after the Civil War was economically
damaged, but under the control of a healthy industrial state.  It merely
languished as a provincial backwater for about a century.  I expect to see
a similar situation in areas where the "Safes" (including the Empire of Deneb)
control Hard Times damaged areas (the Hard Times "frontiers").

        Poor example, Fall of Rome to Charlemagne is about 350 years, not
70.  Good example, in that I think the TNE should be set about 200-300 years
after, not 70.  In 70 years, too many people who remember the Imperium are
still around, and TOO MUCH IMPERIAL TECHNOLOGY STILL WORKS.  Two or three
hundred years is recent enough that PCs can have heard stories from their
grandparents about how it was under the Imperium, and late enough that
surviving TL 15 gear will be rare, delicate museum pieces if it exists at all.

        See note above about "man on a horse".  Charlemagne\'s empire broke
up because of a poorly planned succession policy.  Alexander\'s empire had
the same problem.  For a contrary example, note how long Rome held on to
Caesar\'s conquests in Gaul.  The Romans had a well-established routine for
transfer of rule from one proconsul to another, and they were clearly
subordinate to Rome\'s authority; Charlemagne\'s sons and Alexander\'s heirs
were equals with no central authority to bind them together.
        Point being, viability of interstellar states will depend on internal
politics, not how many years after the collapse of the Imperium it is.

More on the starport codes:
        I still haven\'t tried it, so I can\'t suggest what tuning it might
need yet.  However, the Traffic code seems to be a natural to apply to
the Passengers Available/Cargos & Freight Available tables as a mod.
In addition to the existing mods, use it either as a direct add to the
number of passengers, or as a (Code/5) mod to the number of passengers.
For Cargoes & Freight, Traffic should be a *negative* mod to amount
available.  Why?  My reasoning is that the standard table should actually
be called the "Spot Cargoes and Unscheduled Tramp Freighter Consignments
& Passengers Table"; an entirely different table should be used for
"Subsidized Merchants and Scheduled Liners", and a really different one
for "Perpetual Contract Bulk Haulers".  (SOMEday I might draw them up...)
The more traffic/trade through a port, the more likely cargo and passengers
are to be flying on a subsidized, *regularly scheduled* merchant or liner,
or consigned to a contracted bulk hauler.  Thus, fewer cargoes or passengers
for unscheduled tramp freighters (read: free traders).

This is incorrect. If you use the "standard" pricing plan it is true. If you 
use the *alternative* pricing plan you only get charged for connect time.

At 9600 bps, it costs $24.74/hr. Assuming only 4800 bps "real" troughput, it 
costs about 7 cents per 5000 bytes.

Sorry about throwing things back, but I\'m catching up on missed messages

I think that there may be a way to produce a ship hull without
all the problems about welding plates together and so forth.  If the hull
is originally formed as a solid lump of whatever you are building it out
of.  We might as well assume that it is something disguisting to work
with (like the titanium stuff or supa-dense).  Cast on big lump in the
approximate shape you want the finished product to be (this isn\'t even
totally necessary) and then cut away all the bits you don\'t want with
something that will cut stubborn materials (fusion torch?  plasma welder?)
In effect you tunnel the ship out of a hunk of iridium or whatever.  While
doing this smoothing out the exteriour wouldn\'t prove too hard.

Traveller already assumes that this is how planetoid hulls are produced, would
there be any major problems making all hulls this way (except for the huge
wastage it entails)?

I designed the Gold of Zurrian the Tukera Lines luxury passenger liner
featured in Travellers\' Digest #4.  Joe Fugate specifically requested
that I draw deckplans for the *whole* ship, including things like all of
the bridge positions and the layout of the engineering compartments.

Without thinking about it, I laid out the bridge with the pilot and
copilot all the way forward, and with the pilot on the left.  Behind and
to either side of the pilot, I placed the engineering bridge repeater,
and the internal systems monitor station.  At the aft end, I placed the
navigator and the ship\'s computer primary console; both of these facing
in the opposite direction, towards a large (2 meter diameter) spherical
holographic display.

After Joe Fugate and Marc Miller had reviewed the plans, a few small
changes were made.  The pilot and copilot positions where switched "the
arrangement of pilot and copilot with the pilot on the right follows
Vilani tradition" (Travellers\' Digest #4, p25).  At the time, I was told
that most ships in the Imperium followed Vilani tradition (this may be
documented in a letter from Joe Fugate, but I cannot locate it with a
quick search of my files).

Designing the ship was a good bit harder than most starship designs I
have done.  Part of the problem was that drawings of the exterior of the
ship (in particular, those done by Keith for the Traveller Adventure);
any deckplans had to match the exteriors.  What I did then (and what I
still do for deckplans) is make a mathematical model of the shape (break
it down into basic geometric shapes, and relate them to one another: the
conical nose section is 1.5 times as long as the body is high, etc).
Then I solve for the volume of the hull (and try to err on the side of
slightly too much volume, rather than too little).  In many cases, the
same shape gets re-used for other ships, scaled up or down in size, or
"stretched" in one dimension or another.  There is precedent for this:
the Russian aircraft design bureaus use standardized airframe shapes,
scaled in size to fit the mission.  This is why many Russian aircraft
look so much like bigger or smaller versions of other Russian aircraft.

Then I can do a dimensioned exterior drawing of the ship, and a
cut-away.  I then divide the cut-away iinto decks, and figure out the
planform of each deck.  Meanwhile, I use the ship design to figure out
the size of all of the components in terms of deck-plan squares.  I
xerox the planforms several times, and block in the major components in
different ways until I am happy with their placement.  This rough sketch
is refined, and details filled in.  Using this as a guide, a scale
drawing is prepared (to the same scale, 1/2"=1.5m, as was used by the
Azhanti High Lightning, if at all possible).  Copies are made (most copy
shops can duplicate drawings up to 11"x17") at full scale, and in
reduced size (almost any copyier today can reduce 11"x17" down to
8.5"x11" with a standard setting).  And that\'s it: deckplans for every
purpose.

                Hello again,

        The recent talk about starship/air-raft flight controls reminded me of
a random thought I had some time ago. I was reading an article in Science
(1992, vol.256, pg.s 616-617) called, "Virtual acoustics put sound in its place"
The article explains that audial perception of the real world is more than
simply the triangulation effect. Something that is implicit in having two ears
that are seperated by the thickness of the head (and boy!, some people I know
have very thick heads! :-) Sonic information is significantly effected by its
passage through/past the outer ear. It is a challenge to audio engineers to try
and understand this process and simulate it using computers so as to give a
truely realistic impression of the spacial dimension of sound using only a
"simple" stereo headset.
         Atari, Nintendo, Sega etc. are spending mega-bucks on this concept for
their vidio games as would be expected. However, some very serious uses are also
envisaged. The one cited is for air trafic controllers and pilots. It is
strongly felt that the directional cues given by such a system can improve
response times by fractions or even whole seconds which can be a very important
thing.
        To cut a long story short, this all led me to think that any "task that
is three-dimensional in nature" can be enhanced by virtual technology, and I\'m
thinking of other than the visual/data glove virtual reality which is so popular
at the moment. In sci-fi where artificial gravity within space ships is so
common, one could easily loose all cues with the spacial dimensions of the
outside world. If we assume that at least in some instances (and probably very
crucial instances) direct control of a ship by its pilot will occur, it seems
to me that any technologically advanced society will be using some of these
virtual tricks to improve flying effeciency. Not only acoustics but also subtle
changes inthe  gravitational directions of the flight deck could give real
appreciation of the spacial state of the ship. The idea of having fans blowing
onto Droyne pilots is in the same vein. It may look a little amusing at first
but there would be a very good and serious reason for it.
        Unfortunately, I have gotten to the end of this and had the thought that
it\'s all pretty obvious and may well have been said before, and probably right
under my nose. If so.....oooppps, sorry!

TML::>BTW, is fuel liquid or compressed gas?

   Based on what I\'ve seen in ship designs, and based on what would
   make sense, fuel has to be in liquid form.

   First, the design issue:  Many designs that I have seen plans for
   indicate that there are surge baffles _in_ the fuel tankage.  If
   fuel were compressed gas, baffles wouldn\'t be needed.  But, as the
   level of liquid in the tanks drops, the potential for sloshing
   grows.  The baffles prevent the sloshing from getting too out of
   hand and perhaps doing damage somewhere or other (turning as he
   watches the bulkhead rupture...).

   Second, the "what makes sense", which is partially based on one of
   the thing I learned in high school physics:  With the exception of
   a few strange compounds like dihydrogen monoxide (Water), the solid
   form is always the form whose bulk is the least.  If you try to
   compress a gas to the same volume, it\'ll collapse to a liquid well
   before that point, and to a solid at the volume.  However, managing
   a replenishable solid fuel is rather awkward, so liquid is normally
   accepted, as it is easier to manage, yet with a relatively small
   volume.

Bertil,

In your reply you said that weapon skill is not involved in area fire.  The
same happens in 2300 and at the time I started playing it I asked some friends
in the army what they thought of it.  They told me that for auto-fire you just
have to hold the weapons steady, more-or-less in the direction
of your target.  It doesn\'t take much practice to do this and being a good
sniper won\'t really help much.  So the assets for this type of firing would
be strenght and dexterity (or equivalent).  At least in their opinion.

How is vehicle combat handled in this game?  I\'m basicly talking about shotting
from a running car of from a flying gunship.  In this chapter,2300ad (the basic

    'body' => 'The Gamba subsector discussion between Rob Dean, Steve Higginbotham
and others about agriculture production and tech levels got me to
thinking.

What prevents a low tech agricultural world from importing high tech
farm  equipment(financing not being a problem)? Who prevents technology
transfer between worlds? The Imperium or the local governments? Or is
is even regulated? It doesn\'t seem to be defined very well in the
rules.

If it\'s regulated it is relatively easy to bypass these restrictions
and if not it\'s a non issue. Which brings up the point. Why wouldn\'t
a world import higher tech items? The only restriction I can see
would be maintenance. But even that can be worked around. If you
import a piece of machinery it would be obvious to import the repair
kit and manuals for it and maybe even a repair robot. Either hire a
technician for a temporary period to train some of the locals or
send some of the locals to schools on the higher tech world.

The scenario I\'m thinking about is this:

A rich local or offplanet individual or corporation buys up a large
amount (several thousand acres) of farm land. Basically sets it up
as an agribusiness by importing the higher tech equipment and
training locals or importing the technicians as farm hands.

I\'ve been digging through some agriculture statistics (one of the nice
things about working on a campus - great resources!). I\'ve limited
it to Louisiana only and to those farms that are greater that 2000
acres. These are 1987 numbers taken from the Census of Agriculture.

(bu = 35 liters, in MT 1 ton = 13.5 kiloliters)

Converting the production numbers to MT numbers yields:
85,480 kiloliters or 6,332 tons.

Which is equivalent to 78 free traders or 102 far traders or 32
subsidized merchants. And that is just from one farm of 3700 acres!
It doesn\'t include animal products either.

The initial investment in the farm would be quite large but loans
could be secured once it was shown that quite a profit could be
made in a reasonable amount of time. In fact the profit from the
above numbers is about $118,000 per year which is pretty good.
And the way MT numbers workout it will probably be even larger.

With the imported higher tech level equipment and methodologies
greater yields would be able to support the local population and
create a large quantity for export.

This is another PBEM UPDATE, with your host, Mike Metlay.

This is an official request for contacts from TML members (or friends
of TML members with Net access) who wish to join the TML PBeM game,
now in its fourth year of action. This game is an interactive email
game describing the trials and tribulations of the crews of the
merchant Jump tender Alcyon, the Free Trader Korondor Talisman, the
scout ships Aurora, Paladin, Gemini Arbiter, Westwind, and Bernoulli,
and the Aslan ship Trakh, as they hurl themselves into the Great Rift
seeking the truth about rumors that a Ringworld has been discovered
circling an uncharted star.... (If I could figure out a hook for it,
I\'d write up an article for CHALLENGE about it, as it\'s set a number
of records for Traveller games. Would GDW be interested in something
this off-the-wall, Loren?)

We have strictly limited admission to this game since Mark Cook and I
took over from Richard Johnson two years ago; this was necessary because
the PBeM is an INTERACTIVE game, and every new member was another mail
stream to deal with. This is a nonstructured system in that game turns
do not have fixed lengths-- in fact, when you have thirty people all
talking at once, one hour of game time can take a year of real time
to play! This is the largest game of its kind ever, and in fact we
were glad of the thinning ranks of players as the years went by. But
now we have a glut of very good characters with no one to play them,
and we want to put them back into people\'s hands.

People in the TML PBeM game as of now, who are not running two
characters at once already, are also free to ask for a second
character, and will get first choice of whom to play since they know
of the characters in question already. However, we will not honor all
such requests, and will gently but firmly refuse players whom we feel
are better suited to handling only one character at a time. We
anticipate that this will leave us with two or three openings for new
blood. People from the Listeners list will be considered first, but
only if they can meet the criteria given below.

So if you\'re interested, please send Email to pbemref@engrg.uwo.ca and
let us know. BUT be aware of the fact that this is NOT a first-come,
first-served matter. We will want people who can deal with the limitations
and stipulations of the game, as follows:

1. You\'ll be issued an existing character. You will have a choice of
whom you play, but some characters have extensive histories that you\'ll
need to read up on before you can jump in. No exceptions allowed.

2. Your mailer must be able to handle a HUGE amount of mail. When the
action starts flying thick and fast, we can generate nearly 100k per day
of mail messages. (Before you ask: I work during working hours, and
keep up with this stuff during lunches and evenings, with occasional
breaks for music, food, sleep, and tummybumping.)

3. You must read over the previous year\'s worth of consolidated Turns,
a total of nearly one megabyte of text, to get a feel for the game and
the characters, before starting play. You must also read, understand,
and agree to abide by the Rules for Posts that all players receive.

4. You should be willing and able to absorb a lot of data on the fly,
and at LEAST to have the capability of posting a short move (say, five
lines of text or so, to give a brief answer to a question) once a day.

5. We reserve the right to reject people whose Email connections are
sporadic or flaky, and we prefer but do not insist upon people who
either own their own accounts on public-access systems or who are
connected through jobs etc. No one believed that this game would still
be in its opening stages now, when we started it in 1988. It has enough
potential to be still going strong well into the 21st century, and we
prefer people who can stick with it for more than a year at a time.
We won\'t reject college students out of hand, but you must give us an
honest appraisal of how long you expect to be connected. One recent
addition made Mark and me jump through unbearable hoops to create his
character (it was Greyson, for those in the know), then QUIT at the
end of the school year. I nearly had an embolism on the spot.

6. This is not a democracy. Mark and I haven\'t thrown anyone out yet,
but we\'ll be glad to make a precedent with any willing volunteer.
This game has been running for four years, and those involved have a
strong sense of community and friendship. New people who act in a
disruptive or unpleasant manner will be ejected with extreme prejudice.
We do our damndest to make sure that our rulings are fair and equable,
but if you\'re one of the large subcommunity of the TML who find me or
Mark a pain in the neck, all you need to keep in mind is that in
this game you\'ll be dealing with both of us on a daily basis. \'Nuff said.

Also, for those who would like a taste of what\'s going on in the game,
the latest Turn has been compiled and is available for ftp from
ftp.engrg.uwo.ca, in the compressed file ~ftp/pub/traveller/pbem/Turn.92.03.Z
which uncompresses to one big file. A note about this file, it\'s actually
in two parts, running in parallel to one another, because this last Turn
was so big that it was impossible to edit into one smooth timeline. We
hope our new rules will prevent having another 500k Turn like this one....

Hoping to hear from y\'all (players and new folx alike) soon,

This is all very nice, but wouldn\'t it be easier to just cast a hull if you
wanted to go this route?

This sounds too much like how the sculptor carved a statue of an elephant:
Take a big rock and cut away everything that doesn\'t look like an elephant.

Actually, I always assumed that you would import heavily.  But then you
probably wouldn\'t qualify as a low TL world anymore.  If you assume that TL
indicates local production ability, then low TL worlds with high TL
neighbors can and should import heavily so that standard of living is
higher than TL-low.  Which is why I use three different TL indicators:  one
for total economic strenght, one for production capability, and one for
standard of living.
I don\'t think that the Imperium regulates that sort of trade, though
there have been indications that people lower than TL5 or so are placed on
a restricted-import list, to keep from upsetting the status quo there too
much.
In general, any piece of machinery made close enough to make importing
it practical is also close enough to import spare parts/technicians/tech
manuals/whatever.

Sounds pretty reasonable to me.  I would expect that when these things
begin, the world is on its way to being moderate TL within a decade or two
at the most.  Face it, when gross world product starts to rise, the locals
will have more money to buy that neat high tech stuff, more money to send
the kids to school off-planet (which is how my longest running character
got his start, years ago - go to school on a TL11 world and bring back the
knowledge to his TL5 homeworld - he got distracted, and never got back.
Though he has sent a couple billion Imperial credits back over the last 30
years), that sort of thing.  Just a matter of time till the world matches
the TL of its neighbor to within a point or two.

Your statistics do not tell the whole story in Traveller.  Energy costs in
Trav are EXTREMELY low, and they will end up being the vast majority of the
expenses of running such a place.  Yes, I know that you spend a s**t-pot
full of money on fertilizers and insecticides.  Remember that the local
insects probably don\'t like your food that much, and that fertilizer is a
matter of taking LOTS of energy and adding air, water, dirt, etc.

Be aware that the profitability of this operation will be a function of
available merchant traffic.  In my universe, where merchant traffic tends
to be among the most extreme of the people of the TML, this would be money
in the bank.  If merchant traffic were restricted to the very low level
required for luxury trade only (classic traveller), then you would lose
your shirt if you tried this.  Remember that it would take seven free
traders working full time in the classic traveller picture just to deal
with the output of this one farm.

From the campaign book (can\'t remember the title) of FGU\'s "Chivalry &
Sorcery" game. They had rules for setting up fantasy realms, including
how to calculate merchant and fighting navy sizes. I\'ve made a half-
hearted attempt to find some figures for modern day navies to compare
with but haven\'t found anything useful.

Sure, but emphasize to the players that the TL charts are the rule, the
Terran dates just a memory handle. I was in a campaign where the Referee
let us buy into a newly-opened planet and run a small country. The planet
was TL 4, and the Imperium embargoed import of military stuff of TL 6 and
above. Thus the locals were restricted to singleshot rifles, because they
were specifically mentioned in the charts, and we could import magazine
rifles. Fair enough. But he ALSO allowed us to import Spitfire-type
fighter planes, because they weren\'t specifically mentioned in the charts,
but were 1939 tech, thus TL 5! (We had a lot of fun with that Referee. He
cured me of by-the-book playing for good!)

Quattro Pro calls that a "circular reference", and there are several
such in my MegaTraveller starship design worksheet.  Because I use a
spreadsheet, I can customize it for whatever I want to optimize in the
design by putting a formula in the data entry cells.  For example, if a
design requirement is a certain agility, I put the a formula for total
power required in the cell for power plant size.  Then I go to the
summary page and press "recalc" until the thing either converges on a
solution, or "blows up" indicating that the design is impossible and I
have to try again.

Me too.  One thing I would like is to be able to get the "advanced"
design rules for *EVERYTHING* in one book, so it\'s all in one place.
Everything from lasers and CPR guns to starships, aircraft, watercraft,
tanks, grav vehicles; all in one book.

I tried one of the available CAD packages several years ago.  I came to
the conculsion that it would work well, except for a couple of things:
First, I would need to sit down and create a library of parts for every
common object on the starship (chairs, stateroom furnishings, consoles,
hatches and iris valves, etc).  Then designing a starship would actually
be easy and fast, probably faster than doing it by hand.  Finally, I
would have to find a large plotter: dot-matrix printouts just don\'t cut
it, either in size or quality ---- one of my pencil sketches would be
better.  Since I couldn\'t afford the kind of plotter I felt I needed to
do good deckplans by computer, I have up.

    'body' => 'Here\'s some ideas about the settling of the Sword Worlds:

What we know about the Swordworlder\'s ancestors:

They left Terra in -420.
They were of Germanic and Nordic stock, but these terms had only lin-
guistic meaning by this time.
Assuming that the present day official language of the Sword Worlds
still is fairly close to the the language spoken by the original
settlers, they spoke a variant of Icelandic borrowing heavily from
other Nordic languages as well as from Germanic tongues and from
Vilani (and the socio-political events that produced that little mix
is a facinating object for speculation in itself :-)
They arrived in Spinward Marches ca. -400.
They carried out a survey that detected the Darrian worlds, but did not
contact them as they wanted to create their own indpendent community of
worlds.
They settled the first Sword World, Gram, in -399.
They colonized 4 or 5 worlds in addition to the first one (Gram) in one
century and 12 more in the next.
(The selection of the first four worlds settled after Gram demonstrates
a typical "wargamer" attitude: Joyeuse, Colada, Tizon, and Hrunting. Not
the best worlds of the cluster, but the ones facing the Darrians, thus
preempting these worlds. Cunnonic must have had a viable population to
discourage settlement.)

Well, after some thought I\'ve come up with something that uses most of
these elements. Here it is: The early history of the Sword Worlds:

In -420 the Old Earth Union was in the middle of a civil war. The Sword
Class troop transport GRAM had left Terra carrying 40.000 troops, part
of an invasion force. The capital ships had pounded the defenses into the
ground and the troop transports were moving in to unload when a relief
fleet jumped in and caught them deep in a gravity well. Most of the
invasion fleet was destroyed or captured. The Gram and a few lesser
escorts escaped by jumping from within the jump limit. On the way back
to Terra they learned that their side had lost, and that they had been
branded as war criminals. Eluding the pursuing squadrons they fled
towards the core because that happened to be the way where pursuit was
weakest. They avoided the Vegan Polity and the Easter Concord to avoid
being apprehended and turned over to the Union.
After some discussion it was decided to find a suitable planet or set
of planets and settle down there. Precisely why they decided to leave
the area of the Rule of Man completely is unclear, but that was the
alternative they selected. It became clear, however, that the engines
of the Gram would soon need a thorough overhaul. This presented a problem
since they did not carry much in the way of valuables. The solution was
to find an empty, mineral rich world and set up a small mining operation.
It took 18 years to dig out and refine sufficient precious metal to pay
for a complete overhaul of the Gram and its escorts. They then travelled
through Corridor and Deneb and eventually came to The Spinward Marches.
They might have travelled father yet, but during the jump to Spinward
Marches 1223 they experienced severe jump sickness. They surveyed the
worlds around them and despite detecting the Darrians decided against
risking any further jumps.

The Gram was a 100.000 T, Jump-2 Troop Transport with a crew of 756 and
the capacity to carry 40.000 troops in low berths and an additional 500
passengers (thus enabling staff members of the troops being transported
to be concious during flight). It had been carrying a michellany of units:
The 8th Scandinavian Army Unit[1], various specialist units, including a
mobile field surgery, an Engineer Regiment, and three German Jaeger
Battallions, and a colonial regiment from Agidda. Since Gram had been
sceduled to unload last all of the troops were still on board. The navy
element had a male/female ration of close to 1:1, but the army troops
had a m/f ratio of 4:1. It was therefore decided to allow women to extempt
themselves from dangerous jobs. This was the background for the male-
dominated society developed by the swordworlders. However, a sizable
fraction of the women naturally refused to avail themselves of this, thus
establishing the easy acceptance of females in "male" jobs that is also a
part of swordworlder society.

The common language of the first generation was the anglic of the Old
Earth Union armed forces, but with over 80% of the original settlers
speaking sagamal[2], anglic disappeared in less than a generation,
replaced by a mixture of sagamal, other nordic tongues, germanic, and
the vilani of the Agidda troops.


[1] An army unit is an intermediate step between a division and an army
    used by the Old Earth Union at the time.

[2] "Saga-tounge", an artificial language based on the old Icelandic
    sagas during the Cultural Roots Revival of the 10th Century PI
    and spoken by all scandinavians in the 5th Century PI as a second

    'body' => 'Re Brad Vender\'s questions on robotic brains running the gunnery
stations on starships:

I often include robotic gunnery controllers in private ship designs, but I
also include normal control panels for a human operator\'s use.  Robotic brains
do occasionally malfunction, you know, and somehow they always seem to wedge
just before a couple of pirate type T\'s emerge from the sensor-shadow of a
nearby moonlet.  (If they didn\'t, the PC\'s could out-fight anything from the
Spinward Marches to the Solomani Rim, just by buying lots of levels of Ship
Tactics for their gunnery controllers and piling on the tactics-pool DM\'s.
This is bad.)

Also, if there are no control panels, it\'s impossible to calibrate the gunnery
program.  I assume that the robots need to be "fitted" to the ship by having
dummy sensor input fed in from the ship\'s computer and recording the robot\'s
responses, then tweaking the program\'s parameters, similar to the way a human
gunner gets the "feel" of a new weapon by running drill tapes from the
computer\'s memory and letting it grade his performance.

Regarding semi-intelligent computers, _Starship Operator\'s Manual_ indicates
that all high-TL starship computers have some synaptic circuit elements and a
limited capacity for AI.  This is done to increase productivity (e.g., the
watch officer, concerned about possible unrest among the middle passengers,
tells the computer to "alert me if anything unusual happens in the passenger
lounge area," and trusts the computer to come up with a sensible meaning of
"unusual" based on archived sensor data and programmed parameters of
acceptable passenger behavior).

    'body' => 'Hi.  I\'m a Classic Traveller player from way back (1981 or so)
who just recently started referreeing a game.  I have a copy
of Snapshot (the shipboard combat system) which is pretty much
new, but a little mysterious: the box is fairly worn (perhaps
from sitting on a shelf for years) and says that it is copyright
from 1983.  However, the rules booklet inside is copyright 1979.

My first question is, is this disparity in copyright dates typical
for this game?

Secondly, the game is in new condition.  The cardboard counters
have never been punched out, the rule book is mint, there\'s even
a GDW customer reply card inside which offers to put the buyer on
a mailing list to receive catalogs of their games (I was thinking
of sending it in just to see if anything would ever come back).
Before I start using the game (and dirty up the book and punch out
the counters), is this game worth anything?  If not, is it ever
likely to be valuable?

I\'m not a collector of such things but I know that sometimes these
old, out of print games can fetch a decent price.  I\'d appreciate
any information you can give me.

I assume that the anti-matter is enclosed in some field which prevents
detonation until it reaches its target otherwise it would destroy itself
on the first piece of real matter (read atmosphere) it encountered.

How big is the containment device going to be?  You\'re delivering an anti-matter
powerplant to the target and then switching off the safeguards?

BTW: I\'ve just finished a series (the series isn\'t finished yet) of 7 books
about a character called STEN.  The empire in this series is run solely by
anti-matter and interstellar travel is impossible without this form of large
scale energy release.  It\'s no bad but a bit dated.

In 1984(?) I attended the 42nd World Science Fiction convention in LA with a
friend.  He managed to attend a panel discussing energy or something and the
topic of anti-matter as an energy source came up.  (Now I\'m telling this 3rd
hand so I don\'t know all the details discussed but...)  The general idea was
that if you place normal matter on the EAST of a compass then anti-matter
would go on the WEST side (opposites and such) BUT they postulated the
existence of two other types of matter (NORTH and SOUTH) which could be
handled separately with ease (ie bare hands) but when brought together
would react just like EAST-WEST matter did.  The NORTH and SOUTH matter is
created using lots of energy (solar power, fusion whatever) in fact, more
energy than you get out of the resulting matter interaction.  The big
advantage of such matter is that the NORTH-SOUTH powerplant is very tiny,
delivers the energy in vast immediate quantities, is very very safe, and the
ingredients are very very very safe.

Has anybody heard anything about this before?

I like this.  Most of the people who want the detail will probably

Now you mention it, that reminds me... When the Lisa (remember that
machine?)  first came out, we had one at NCR Ithaca.  I tried deck
plan stuff with it (Classic Traveller at that time), but never really
got beyond playing with it.  I suspect I could do something similar
with the current draw-whatever packages, but I could really use it
tailored for Traveller ship design -- I\'d love a status window that
tells me how many "squares" of computer room or gunnery controls I
need to add, for example, or how much mess room space I have left.  I
doubt that the market is big enough to justify the software investment
for a commercial company, however, and I know practically nothing
about the programmability of current commercially available drawing
programmes...?

With the advent of laser printers (not that *I* have one), your
concerns about the quality of hardcopy output are probably less
significant these days.

(I was going to add some other stuff, but I\'ll put it under a
different subject heading, I think...)

as to how to relate to MT numbers (preferably not too expensive a book).

What are the effects of orbital bombardment on un-hardened ground
targets?  What are the range of effects of a single-ship nuclear or
conventional missile attack on a target such as a troop encampment, a
starport, or a government building?  Obviously, point-defense and
area-defense will alter the situation, but if the effects on
defenseless targets are known then it should be relatively simple to
take into account other factors.
    I would basically like to know the capabilities of a battery-round
from a single missile turret (standard 3-missile rack), and from a
100t missile bay, using conventional and nuclear anti-ship munitions
as might be found on an average merchant ship. :-)
    Exact numbers are not too important as such, but I do want a feel
for the general capabilities of this sort of weapon.  If my players
want to take out a large downtown building, say, or wipe out a
guerilla camp, what are their options, assuming local air-space
superiority and an insufficient ground troop capability?  I imagine a
lot depends on how much collateral damage they are prepared to
inflict...?  (At least they have no anti-matter tennis balls.)
    How would the capabilities vary with TL?  I imagine precision
would improve greatly at higher TL\'s, but what about yield?

    'body' => 'NPC MOTIVATIONS:

Couple of people have asked me about the secondary character profiles. Best
reference is to get hold of Andy Slack\'s "Expanding Universe" rules
extensions for Classic Trav, revised and reprinted in "Best Of White Dwarf
Articles Vol 1", publ 1980, since there is a lot of other useful stuff in
there. The secondary profile stuff had come from an earlier article by Tony
Bath which I no longer have, but is mentioned here as part of a quite
decent alien generation system (which works up to a point ...).

Basically, roll 2D6 for the following: Disposition, Morals, Generosity,
Loyalty, Courage and Ambition. For classic trav (ie pre task system)
throw less than or equal to the characteristic most relevant to the
interaction you are dealing with, modifying by factors such as role playing
ability, referee\'s mood etc (didn\'t call it classic for nothing). So for
offering a police officer a bribe, modify by bribery skill, what you think
of the amount offered, maybe law level (for the police officer\'s fear of the
consequences of getting caught) relative to a sensible mean (say 7) and
throw against morals.

Using the task system, apply the relative NPC characteristic mod,just as you
do for PC characteristics, to appropriate tasks.

Given the appropriate choice of characteristics (and I\'m not sure that
the WD set is the right one) this is a very effective way of managing NPCs
in game terms, and of differentiating between them (note also that aliens
will get mods on their initial throws).

WISH LIST:

(Actually, I don\'t really have a wish list as such, so please don\'t take
this as complete ... I\'m sure there\'s another few things I could think of):

1) Don\'t do it! Oh well ...

2) Learn from what DGP did right. Although the MT stuff for GDW was, erm,
lacking in several departments, what DGP published under their own marque
was generally of the highest standard. The picture:text ratio was right
(looking at for example the Dark Conspiracy material in our local shop I
feel it has too many illustrations) and supplements (or in the case of the
the Aliens stuff, each half of each supplement) were generally illustrated
throughout by the same artist, to maintain a consistent feel. And the
artists were excellent, of course.

Also what they published, and what they
planned to publish. I would like to see the equivalent of
following material (darn it I would have liked to see it for MT):
- - the 5 alien supplements, esp the minor race one
- - starship operators manual, vols 1 AND 2 - I got the impression that this
  would lead into a set of sourcebooks for particular types of ship
- - combined scenario / sector sourcebooks, like the Flaming Eye, like the
  planned Black Duke, etc.
- - World Builder\'s Handbook, and the planned Grand Explorations book (how I
  was looking forward to that one).

I also thought that the Keith brothers\' idea expressed in MTJ3 of having
sourcebooks based around particular professions was a good one. If we had
had the old character generation system, the WBH could have had the expanded
char generation for Scientists, for example. I would have liked to have
seen some of the Medical Digest stuff from TD compiled and expanded as
a medical sourcebook.

Finally on this point, I\'d like to see the DGP equipment charts and task
libraries (assuming there is still some form of task system) continue
in some form, rather than have the dreary and less useful equipment lists
I can see in other games (including the original MT rules).

3) Related point - sort out your licensing! Get some licensees to replace
the lost ones ... they add to the vitality of the game. In particular find
a miniatures license - my personal preference would be Grenadier but I\'m not
fussy.

I\'d also like to see some of the old licensed material, in particular
the Paranoia stuff, rehabilitated and reprinted if possible. Alot of people,
including me, liked it and felt it added something to the game (including
a number of interesting new and significant aliens, for which there is
a crying need).

4) Um, that\'s it for now ... (it\'s late)

I disagree, although the reason is that I don\'t think such a complete
collapse is likely anyway. Less than a hundred years after Theodosius the
Great, Theodoric had established an Ostrogothic kingdom that
stretched from France to Yugoslavia. And the Eastern Empire was more
or less intact through most of this period. Point being that larger polities
inevitably emerge to fill such vaccuums, which is where I think Hard
Times goes wrong. As for technology, very little was lost; what was lost
was the ability to advance further. Economically and militarily important
technologies are in such times the most jealously protected; notably noone
during the dark ages forgot how to ride a horse from Rome to Byzantium, it
just got a lot more difficult and alot less safe. Same applies to the 30
years war - the balance of power shifted in Europe to a bunch of more
stable states at the periphery, who took advantage of the advances made
in military technology during the war.

Agreed on the last point, although the smaller the power which establishes
hegemony (and we are being told that at this point they are very small) and
the faster it is established, the more unstable that hegemony will be. Rome
took a lot longer to get there and stopped while it was ahead ...

Again, though, note what happens when these empires do break up ... even
very unstable powers such as these collapse into relatively stable smaller
empires - the Short Nap shouldn\'t actually happen.

I\'ve often thought that the period
after Alexander provides a good model for the post-Rebellion era - a number
of strong and stable rump states (for Egypt and the Seleucid Empire read
Deneb, Vland and Antares), a few which fall pretty quickly (Gushemege,
Illelish for the Greek and Indian possessions) and the gradual infringement
of newer and more vital empires at the periphery (for Rome and Parthia,
provide the alien empires of your choice).

When Alexander was asked on this death bed as to who should
rule the empire after his death, legend has it that his reply was "kratistos"
(to the strongest). I\'ve often thought this would make quite a good
Rebellion era scenario title ... maybe it\'s not to be.

FINALLY:

I\'m in Austin, Tx. next week on business and would like to supplement my
collection, not only of traveller stuff but for other games - anyone know
any good gaming stores in town?

Would you really use ship-to-ship nuke missiles against ground targets?
I would have thought you\'d need specialist missiles for atmospheric
re-entry and atmospheric operation.

Assuming you get the warhead to the target then it should be fairly
easy to calculate blast radius etc for current day Kiloton payloads.

Variation with TL?  There must be a limit to how effecient you can make
a nuke of a given payload.  Would the size change much?  Would the bomb
be a LOT cleaner (or dirtier)?

Should be cleaner and less stopable to simply use a streamlined
kinetic weapon than a nuke.

Has anyone done some design work on what a kinetic missile should look
like, costs, size, damage etc?

I had some trouble concearning wilderness refueling at my last MT session.
I don\'t know if anyone of you has ever thought about the time, a starship
needs to get close to a large or small GG. I don\'t have my rulebooks with
me, but I think a typical Far Trader oder a Subsidized Merchant using a
Maneuver=1 drive needs 18 hours from the jump exit (100 diameters) to a
small GG. Even worse, if they approach a large GG. Even if the ship has
a purification plant which take 6 hours for purify, the ship will need
more than two days, before refueling is done.

   If I remember the ideas of refueling by asteroid ice, discussed in this
list earlier, I think mining an ice asteroid could take much less time for
a small ship. It takes only minutes to approach an asteroid, an then do
the necessary mining in one day. Mining an asteroid is not so difficult,
if you have done some engineering work, before the crew attempts to do so.
I suggest a small robot with a heater to melt the ice and a pump, to pump
the resulting water per tube into the ship. Don\'t forget to use the
purification plant though :-).

Any Comments ?

     SYNOPSIS
          tnc [out_file]

     DESCRIPTION
          Tnc is a trade & commerce generator which produces random
          lists of freight, cargo, and passengers, based on attributes
          of a source and destination star-system pair, plus the
          abilities of the crew negotiating for those goods.


Enjoy!

  I\'ve done some plans with ClarisCAD on a SE/30 and it came out ok IMHO.

  Of course, I still have to compute the number of squares of each type of
compartment by hand and I\'ve had some problems in making fit them into
something shiplike.

  What it does automate on the other hand is the drawing of the 1.5m deck
squares... (oops, hope they keep the 1.5m squares in TNE...) and once I had
a library of chairs, autogalleys and couches, the crew areas are rather easy
to detail.

  It is the drives that are the real pain.

          Some arm-waving: Specialist ortillery nukes would probably
          be better, but it would be embarrassing to have the wrong
          kind.  At the same time, given the prevalence of laser
          antimissile weapons, you probably want some hardening for
          your missiles.  Why not an ablative heat shield?  Lots of
          details of course...

          I seem to recall that the old _Striker_ rules said that
          standard nuke missile yields were 150 kT@ for turret
          missiles, 250 kT@ for bays.  But that\'s hazy and I\'m an old
          fart, firmly committed to _High Guard_ design practice.

          Any other OF\'s out there to swap Book 5 designs with?

Many ships in civilian operation have ship-to-ship missiles, while
space-to-ground weapons would be hard to justify, both in economic
terms and to the authourities.  Occasionally, someone is going to have
the desire to hit something on the ground, and they just have to use
what\'s available.
    I agree that a ship with a design mission that includes ground
attack would have specialised weapons, in which case I would expect
both MIRV-type warheads and slow-entry stealthy precision-target
drones (it\'s hard to be stealthy on a fast atmospheric entry, to say
nothing of the radio communication problems under those conditions).
    Remember also that not every target is in some place with an
atmosphere... although in that case an analogy with ship combat can
probably provide an excellent approximation.

Yes, but what *is* the payload of a standard anti-ship missile?
Surely someone has worked this out already?

Some random comments on NPC personalities and then replies on antimatter
and on orbital bombardments.

The NPC motivations index that\'s been suggested is good; T2k2 already
has the "Card Deck" NPC type generator, which is one way of doing things,
and the second set of stats that\'s been proposed here is another.
Personally I\'d guess that GDW will go with keeping the T2k2 system,
but you never know.  The bigger system has advantages if you want
to detail people.

Antimatter:
I\'m not quite sure who generated that compass-directions view of
antimatter and normal matter, but it doesn\'t jibe with physics.
There aren\'t intermediate states between antimatter and matter;
antimatter and matter both gravitationally attract each other,
(and themselves), behave normally electrically (though with
opposite sign charge) etc.

Also, when you get a big ball of say anti-iron together, it does
not simply go "boom" when exposed to air.  What happens is that
you get minimal ionization off the surface of the ball,
which also ionizes a lot of air around, leading to a high temperature
and pressure but low density (and low reaction rate) plasma around
the antimatter.  If it starts to impact something solid, you get some
rebound effect, but mostly you get a slow, difuse reaction as the
ball boils off into the plasma and the plasma self-anhilates.
Slowing it down more is the fact that most of the actual anhilation
will be electron/antielectron anhilation (unless the room\'s made
of iron walls or until the plasma is hot enough for the anti-iron to
fission).

The ball will rebound off the floor if it falls onto it, but
won\'t go "bang".


Bombardments:
An orbital bombardment with nuclear missiles will look a lot like
any other nuclear missile bombardment: bang.  There are plenty of films
of open-air nuclear tests to see what happens....

          Note that ships tagged with an (*) arrived one day, presumably
     loaded/unloaded, and left the next day...fast turnaround.  Many of
     these ships exceed 2000 TRAVELLER tons in displacement.  No
     supertankers, New Orleans is not a deep enough port.  So on *one*
     *day*, we had at least 40,000 - 50,000 Traveller displacement tons
     (Fermi figure) of shipping in and out... times 365 days =
     18,250,000 Traveller tons?  Even with the MegaTraveller
     "interlinked economies" model of trade, that\'s a lot of traffic.
     Twenty ships comparable to an Akerut, Oberlindes, or Imperial Lines
     freighter every day.  So what\'s traffic like on pop A world?
          I notice that names vary from the romantic to the appallingly
     mundane.  (I like "Mega Buck", tho.  Shows a certain amount of
     chutzpah.)  Shipping lines often give their ships names of the same
     type/flavor; for example, Lykes Lines has a tradition of naming all
     its ships ships after female members of the Lykes familiy.  In the
     _Traveller Adventure_, we are given the ship name styles of several
     of the major shipping lines, btw.  Just another little something to
     add flavor to your universe, eh what?

Quite a while ago, I read an interesting article (I believe that it was in
Analog\'s Science Fact column) that attempted to determine whether or not
there were any large quantities of antimatter nearby (such as in this
Galaxy).  The conclusion was that there is not, based on observed
characteristics of cosmic radiation.

So any antimatter fuel will have to be created in a particle accellerator.
Doing so will consume more energy than anihallating the antimatter will
produce; so no energy is created.  Instead, antimatter is only an efficent
way to store energy.

Well, I\'d call that a sucessfully achieved design goal.  The virus was
supposed to be a plot device which causes the complete collapse of
interstellar society.  Everyone throws away or stops using anything more
sophisticated than an internal combustion engine, and wants to have nothing
to do with starships or space travel.  Even (nay, ESPECIALLY) when a bunch
of interstellar merchants show up and try to trade.

The "true story" behind the what happened is supposed to be a mystery.  The
common knowledge (so far, anyway) is what happened in Challenge #64; there
should be hints and clues that point to the conclusion that the common
knowledge is not actually what happened ... Exactly what the truth is
should be up to each individual referee; my virus story was intended to be
one such possibility (the details were provided so that referees can leave
appropriate clues for the players to pick up, and eventually solve the
mystery).

It could also bear pointing out that after the initial period of crazy

pedals, throttle) has become a de-facto standard, even as controls advanced
from direct mechanical linkages to power assisted controls, to the modern
"fly-by-wire" electronic control systems and the current "fly-by-light"

remain standard, while the "brains" behind the control system improve.

Well, if we assume a 1cm beam (arbitrarily chosen); the vaporized area will
be slightly larger than the beam.  let\'s say approx 1.15cm, then we have a
vaporized area of 1cm^2.  If we are vaporizing 25cc of water (flesh), we
have a 25cm deep hole (about 10 inches deep; enought to ruin your whole
day!).  Water requires a suprising amount of energy to vaporise it!  The
absorption of metal plate will of course be different than that of water;
and so will the energy required to vaporize it.  But a 7cm deep hole does
not sound so unreasonable.

Probably.  Most lasers would probably be constructed to operate on a good
general-purpose setting, and would not be adjustable.  On the other hand,
some expensive models would offer adjustable settings.  However, changing
the frequency of a laser would require some power loss, so these would
either accept the lower beam energy (unlikely), or have a higher power
draw.

> So now you have a pulse laser with 10 times the intensity vs a beam
> laser with 10 times the duration.

The pulse duration is probably more like 0.01 second or less.  3G3 treats
beam lasers as pulse lasers that fire 100 pulses per second; I would assume
a pulse width of 0.005sec and a 50% duty cycle (ie: 0.005sec on followed by
0.005sec off).  Compared to a CW (continous wave) beam laser, the multipulse
beam is twice as intense, but is "on" for only half the time.  Although both
lasers deliver the same amount of energy to the target over the same time
period, the short, rapid pulses will probably do more damage.

A monopulse laser which delivers the same energy in one large pulse (with a
duration of maybe 0.01sec) would have a beam 100 times as intense as the CW
beam laser (but of course, lasting only 1/100th the time).  Such a pulse
would do far more damage to the target than the CW beam laser.

There are limits to the intensity of a laser beam or pulse.  If the laser
light is travelling through an atmosphere, it can reach a point where the
beam ionizes the air as it passes through it.  This ionized air will absorb
and refract far more energy than un-ionized air would.  However, this
ionized air is a good channel for an electric charge or a charged particle
beam.

Or operate the pulse laser at reduced output and increase the pulse
frequency.  After all, enough pulses per second (and it doesn\'t take many)
looks like a beam to the human eye.

Or try playing Photon.  You shoot at each other with sort-range infra-red
in a cluttered, dimly-lit, sometimes smoked-up maze (rather like boarding
action combat aboard a disabled starship, come to think of it).  You need
to stay alert, trust noone, and keep your laser handy (oops, wrong game!).
Seriously, though, the major problem is to stick with your buddies and not
get ambushed from around the corner or side passage.

One possibility is the exchange rate chart (most recently incorporated into
Striker, also printed in several other places in Classic Traveller).  I
still use this chart, although (as far as I know) it is not official with
MegaTraveller.

That all depends; for example, labor might be cheaper on less-developed
worlds.  According to Striker, the average per-capita income (in local
credits) for a world correlates to tech level.  In other words, higher TL
workers get paid more.  The exchange rate chart magnifies this effect by
making these local credits worth even less as starport quality and local
tech level decrease.

This means that labor-intensive goods will be less expensive if produced at
a lower tech level.  High-tech worlds without the labor forces to be
classified as "Industrial" may mass produce unfinished components to be
completed and assembled wherever the work force is both plentiful and less
expensive.  Other possibilities are mineral resources.  If the resources
are readily accessible and of high quality it may be economical to mine
them elsewhere and ship them to where they are needed.

I have a cartoon on the wall at work that shows a picture of the ultimate
mouse trap.

Has a dial for the type of cheese to simulate (BREE, CHEDAR, EDAN, etc) as
well as a PSI setting (SCARE, STUN, MAIM, KILL).

What types of settings would you have on a laser?  Just low thru high or
something like on your clothes iron?

I remember a seminar/conference I attended about 8 years ago where one
of the panel members was a Hollywood special effects/demolitions/
electronics guy.  I can\'t remember his name at the moment.

Anyway, he claimed that he coupled the BIC Lighter friction method of
igniting the gas in the Lighter (the wheel thingy at the top of those
throw away gas lighters) WITH a standard revolver pistol.  The cartridges
were replaced with crystals (suitable for producing laser light) and the
action of the hammer falling provided sufficient current to produce a
dangerous but very very short laser pulse.

He claimed that the original was a single shot weapon because the crystal
heated up (or something) and so he evolved to the revolver setup.

It was a large audience (read 100+) of science fiction fans and nobody
called him a liar at the time.

Such a hand weapon would have no need for a power-source but would be
limitted to the speed of trigger movement and crystal cooling between
shots.  The chap actually claimed that it was a registered weapon
because it would burn you (or was it blind you?).

Would any of the experts care to comment on this.

I raise it because if feasible it would change the way laser guns
operate ---- perhaps.

Thirz Ueghzgi Class Corvette TL 13

A fighting ship of the Thirz Empire (Thirz Uerra) in Gvurrdon Sector.
The Thirz have very few yards capable of capital ship construction, but
quite a few yards capable of producing good ships under 5000 tons.  One of
the mainstays of the Thirz Navy is the Ueghzgi Class Corvette, a fast
maneuverable escort-size ship with heavy missile armaments.  Unlike the
escort, she is not used as a support vessel in a cruiser squadron, but is
organized into squadrons of her own type and used as the primary offensive
vessel of the Thirz Uerra.  Weak Vargr Corsairs have a marked dislike for the
ship, as it is deadly as an opponent, but does not carry enough cargo to be
useful as a lone corsair.  Strong Vargr Corsair bands are very fond of its
firepower and survivability in fleet actions; loot-hauling is for freighters.
It is also known for its incredibly cramped accomodations; "hot-racking"
is the norm on this vessel.  It is said that on this ship, Frozen Watch
is a desirable assignment because they get a whole low berth to themselves.
Needless to say, sharing a stateroom rather than a bunk is a sign of
charisma; ranking officers who share full-size staterooms are always high-
charisma Vargr.  In spite of the accomodations, the Corvette is considered
a charismatic assignment; she\'s a deadly fighting ship.  Only high-performance
fighters and the few Thirz capital ships are considered better (more
charismatic) assignments.
Note that performance was gained at the expense of endurance; her
designers assumed that any high-speed pursuit will be over in less than 7
days, as 7 days @ 6G is enough delta-V to span most solar systems and reach
almost all jump points; she has enough maneuver fuel remaining for 1G cruising
for the rest of the month, plus a total of 72 hours of weapons firing.

Heh. Anyone ever see the shortlived (six episodes, one BBC "season") series
STAR COPS? Stupid name for IMO the best SF series in history, the ongoing
story of an ex-policeman\'s attempts to forge an effective international
investigative team for crimes occurring off the earth in the early part
of the 21st century. How do you handle crimes whose very definitions and
existence change with technology? Kidnapping fertilized ova, cloning,
pharmaceutical terrorism, sabotage in labs that can be opened to vacuum, etc.
Highly recommended. Anyway, one plot concerned the development of a tunable
portable laser weapon, which (at the cost of power loss) could be tuned
so as to have variable effectiveness against armor, space suits, or flesh.
In fact, it could be tuned finely enough (I think the math works, too) to
give a caucasian a nasty skin burn but blow a hole in a black man. As one of
the lead characters (a black American astronaut) mutters, "Great. Racist
weaponry!" |-< |-P

I can see the Solomani issuing lasers to their troops that would only
torch a Suerrat....

(The use of politics on the show is interesting too BTW. Every episode, they
pick a new supergiant to slam on: the USA, the EEC, the Indians, the Arab
oil sheiks, the Japanese megacorporations, etc.)

This works very easily. You could build it into an existing laser for pennies;
the UI would be the most expensive part. I\'ve always ruled that lasers are
self-targeting, in my games. Squeeze the grip, get a bead; squeeze the trigger,
shoot.

*Embarrassed blush* I am and have been for a long time a pretty good pistol
shot, but I made a complete fool of myself in the Naperville Photon Arena.
Shooting and being shot at are two very different things, and it takes a
long time to develop reflexes (and a lot of money, too). You also learn a
few things about encumbrance. They strap a helmet and a huge battery pack
on you, and suddenly it\'s not quite as easy to do the acrobatics you see
in the movies. |->

It would also help if the SFX in your internal helmet speaker for "fire,"
"hit scored on opponent" and "hit scored on you" were easier to differentiate
amidst all the noise and screaming. |-\\

Well, maybe for small craft with high agility and a single point of control,
like current aircraft, that may be true. But for a low agility craft I would
see joystick/rudder/pedals as pretty useless ... are large submarines
steered that way? (Steve?) Once you have something like that then it might
make sense to extrapolate a common interface which was useful for piloting
all kinds of craft across the range. Or maybe not -
 its difficult to imagine given that the extent to which our perspective,
based on 60 or so years of experience compared with the thousands of years
for the Imperium. Truth is you can\'t see that kind of change coming till
it hits you in the face. For example, this device I keep trying to talk into
is called a mouse :-) (paradigm shift, anybody?).

A submarine uses two control yokes similar to an airliner\'s (one to
control the planes and one for the rudder), plus a wheel about 30"
across (speed control forward) , plus a 20" wheel (speed control
backwards).  Plus the guy who controls trim, who sits at a panel full
of switches and pushbuttons.  Plus the guy who actually gives the orders,
of course.  He just stands around drinking coffee and trying to look
like he knows what is going on.
Most Navy surface ships have similar controls, though I am given to
understand that the newest stuff has a wheel about half the size of your
car\'s steering wheel, plus a throttle.

Mark suggested that on spacecraft with low maneuverability a
stick and rudder type control system is not necessary.  When you\'re
moving really slowly, or don\'t have much agility, you don\'t really
need a high performance type control panel for low performance
engines.  This is mostly true.

However, the normal traveller spacecraft is capable of at least 1G
acceleration for maneuvering.  Now let\'s look at a comparable
performance:  The only aircraft *I* know of with a large production
that has a 1 to 1 thrust to weight ratio (hence 1G acceleration)
is the high performance fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.
Therefore, those clunky old 1G Type A Free Traders got a whole
hullovalot more maneuverability than most people realize!

The only powered traveller space craft that have less than 1G
maneuver are those equipped with either Mass Drivers, or Ion
Drives.  Even those craft will need some sort of directional
controllers and maneuvering jets.  So, why would one design a
control panel just for those two cases that would require special
training in order to operate them?  If the pilot trained on a
control stick (or one of the other types I mentioned) why bother
changing it?  I don\'t know for certain, but I\'m willing to bet you
that the Skylab, Salyut, Mir, and the proposed Station Freedom all
had/have/will have joystick attitude controllers for the rare times
that the stations need re-alignment.

Traveller space craft that have less thrust than one of today\'s top
interceptors are the exception, not the rule.  Now, the F-15 may be
capable of 9G turns, so maybe you disagree with me over the
definition of maneuverabilty/thrust.  But, as a student pilot, I
was not allowed to put the Cessna 152 into maneuvers that were more
than 1G (60 degrees angle of bank)  (My CFI had this temper ya
know... :-)  Anyway, I\'ll tell ya.  *I* wouldn\'t wanna fly
maneuvers like that without the kind control afforded by a stick or
some similar control system.  1G is a *lot* more than it sounds
like.  If you don\'t like plane analogies, 1G is more maneuver than
ANY automobile is or will be ever capable of.

I was speaking of a slow, "single-shot" laser, i.e. pulse, wait
one second, pulse, etc.  A fast-pulsing laser would be functionally
equivalent to a beam laser in terms of beam continuity, targeting, etc.

Actually, I\'ve played paintball in such surroundings.  Photon
doesn\'t do much for me.  I just deleted about a paragraph\'s worth of
ranting about how horrible photon is.  This isn\'t the place.  I\'ve
played paintball in one of the best indoor fields I\'ve ever seen - it
used to be a state mental hospital.  Three floors, hallways, rooms,
windows, stair wells, roofs, etc.  Tons o\' fun.  Several games we
played with LZ-marker smoke flares to provide an interesting
environment.

Well, the first right reflex is pretty easy to develop - get
down behind cover as fast as possible.  The problem is unlearning this -
figuring out when you should be up and moving.

This is certainly true.  When I play paintball I generally
wear a camo jumpsuit with lots of pockets for 12-gram CO2 and paint,
and carry a Rapide or similar paintball gun, slung SMG-style.  On
occasion I\'ve worn belts with ammo pouches, canteens, etc, but they
always get in the way, they generally bounce around when you have to
run, and most importantly (for me), they tend to get caught on things
when you\'re slithering through knee-high grass and undergrowth to get
in for a close-up...

The constant "noise" from the photon helmet speaker was quite
annoying.  You can learn a LOT about what\'s going on around you if you
listen.  The helmets also limited peripheral vision far too much, for
no good reason.

Huh.  Kinda makes you wonder just what sort of control panel a craft with a 6G
maneuver drive and an agility of 3 or so would have.  Must be something pretty
special.

On the other hand, keep in mind that the forward acceleration of 1G for a Type
A doesn\'t translate to 1G of *lateral* acceleration; thrusters only get 40%
of normal efficiency parallel to the plates, so that\'s only 0.4G lateral
acceleration.  You\'d know better than I would, but isn\'t lateral acceleration
more closely related to maneuverability and "crankiness" than forward
acceleration is? 0.4G is an *awful* lot less than the 9G that you say an F-15
can pull in a tight turn.

  Newer Swedish subs use one \'airliner\' yoke to handle all the pitch and yaw
steering. I have reasons to suspect that the same person also holds the
throttles. The trim I\'m not certain about.

  And, btw, there is still one extra person there to give the orders:)

  Eh, looks like we\'re back to the old agility vs acceleration thread again:)

  If you are going to compare the maneuverability of a 1G ship and a
jet fighter, you can\'t use the fighters engine acceleration as a input,
since the fighter uses airfoils to turn, not thrust.

  The comparision should be made between the ship that can do 1G turns and
the aircraft that can do 9G turns (And probably 15G for high-TL hybrids that
mount 6G compensators).

  So while a good scout ship (2G) should be able to outclimb almost anything
TL8 or less (except SAM\'s:) almost anything including a WWI fighter should
be able to outturn the scout ship.

  (It won\'t do them any good however, since almost all spaceships mount
turreted weaponry)

  I\'m resonably certain that the Shuttle use a joystick for in-orbit
maneuvering.

Don\'t for get the Harrier!  It probably has more in common with
Traveller spacecraft than just about anything else flying today.  It
uses a stick, rudder pedals, and throttle just like a conventional
aircraft.  The stick and rudder controls are also connected to a
reaction control system, which uses small jets of engine bleed air (high
pressure air from the engine) to control the aircraft at low speeds
where the aerodynamic control surfaces would be ineffective.

The harrier also has a thrust vector control, on the same side as the
throttle, as I remember.  Because of this arrangement, you can\'t change
the thrust vector at the same time as you work the throttle.  That\'s OK,
becaue you usually don\'t need to (example: you use the vector control to
bring the aircraft to a hover, and then use the throttle to reduce
thrust and lower it to the ground).

Other aircraft with a thrust/weight ration of about 1:1 are: Mirage 2000
almost makes it with an "air combat" load (within 1,000 lbs with the
burner lit).  The F-16 is slightly over 1:1 with an AAM load and full
afterburner, as is the F-15 in the same configuration.  The MIG-21/bis
with half internal fuel and a "typical" load also makes it.  The
Yak-36MP also qualifies (being the Soviet equivalent of a Harrier).
Data extracted from Gunston and Skick\'s "Modern Air Combat" (Crescent
Books, 1983).  By no means an authoritative or exhaustive reference.

I\'m not sure, but I\'d bet that the American vehicles all have pilot
controlled backup or emergency attitude control systems.  The presence
of this kind of equipment has saved missions and possibly lives ever
since the original astronaut corps insisted that they be installed early
in the US space program.  (If I remember correctly, the first US
rondezvous was completed manually, with one astronaut looking up figures
on a table, because the computer was on the blink).

I\'m not so sure about Russian equipment; they tend more towards
automatic or ground controlled spacecraft.

        I may be utterly wrong, be 1G acceleration on modern day
military aircraft would surely be common (or even exceeded) .. if
they are structurally capable of 9G turns, and commonly do 4-6G
turns ..... can anyone tell me for sure?

        Hmmm .. the difference in size between the bulk of the
ships in Traveller and modern day fighters (and Cessnas :) is
pretty large .. so I would suggest that whilst a control yoke is
consistent with what we expect, perhaps (due to the large
role of automation) we may have something more like options on a computer
console (it would be quite complex to maneuver a large bulk in zero-gravity)
 .. I don\'t know .. interesting topic tho\'.

Quickly, 1G may be more than the average family saloon is capable of .. but
Formula 1 GP cars accelerate at 1.3G, brake at 4G, and corner at 4.5G ..
so I would guess that modern sports cars would maneuver at 1G in some cases
(and think of the acceleration of modern day super-bikes .. 0-100km/h in
less than 3-3.5 seconds? seems pretty impressive 2 me ...)

I looked up a few things in the CRC handbook.  I was wrong.  An
automobile *is* capable of more than 1G acceleration.  The static
coefficient of friction of rubber on \'solids\' ranges from 1 to 4.
That would be the max accel for a car.

Now, someone suggested (sorry I forget who) that the old type A
trader will only turn at 0.4G\'s not 1G for lateral acceleration.
Now, a corresponding angle of bank for an aircraft is about 45
degrees.  Now most aircraft rarely exceed that.  It\'s kinda rare
that you get on an airliner that banks that steeply.  Flying
traffic patterns (landing & take off) under normal circumstances
you only use a 30 degree angle of bank (0.15G\'s).  Having any less
control than a stick and rudder for routine delicate maneuvers like
that would be needlessly risky.

Have you tried any flight simulator programs?  Well, it\'s a heck of
a lot easier to fly with a stick than it is with a keyboard.
(mouse... etc.)

Wildstar:
Yeah, I forgot about the Harrier & the Forger.  That\'s what you get
for posting with a stuffed head.  But I rather doubt that about the
MiG-21.  One of my flight instructors was an ex soviet frontal
aviation pilot.  He said the MiG-21 was a pig with weight to thrust
somewhere around 6 : 1.  Also, when they get *That* light on fuel,
you can\'t afford to go very far.  And there\'s a *huge* amount of
unusable fuel in the MiG-21\'s tanks.

Why not?  Presumably, the Imperial Navy uses specialized ordinance for
planetary attack, but there will be occasions when an ordinary ship needs to
attack a planet.  Ordinary missiles (conventional or nuclear) can probably
be pressed into service.  "Ortillery" well-established in the Traveller
universe; in a pinch I\'m sure that the player characters will improvise
something that will work.

I haven\'t, but the subject has been kicked around both on TML and in the
Science-Fiction field for a while.  One proposal was a bundle of steel rods,
each rod with a guidance unit and control surfaces.  The bundle would be
"parked" in orbit, and provided with a rocket motor to de-orbit the bundle
on command.  During re-entry, each rod seeks its target, and should impact
with enough energy to punch a hole through just about anything (tanks,
ships, runways, etc).

Presumably something like AutoCAD would be up to it; not that I own a copy
of AutoCAD.  I don\'t know what\'s available in PD/ShareWare CAD packages, but
perhaps one of them would also do the trick.

When the TNE ship design system comes out, I will probably create another
ship design spreadsheet, and I will almost certainly create a page that
shows the major components in terms of deckplan "squares" (or whatever TNE
will use; I would like to see the 0.5"=1.5m scale continue).  A possibility
would be to key this data into a programmable calculator (my trusty HP41C
comes to mind) so that the calculator can keep track of it; perhaps using a
set of keys to request "squares remaining" and another set to subtract
"squares drawn" from a set of categories.

The paper size is a little small, though.  Most laser printers still only
handle 8.5x11" paper.  While I drew some plans this small (small craft and
100-tonners) most were on 11x17" paper (about the same size as those
provided with Azhanti High Lightning) and some were 17x22".  I also do the
original drawings in color (red for drives and heavy equipment, green for
controls and electronics, black for hull, bulkheads, partititions and
detals, and sometimes blue to mark fuel spaces).  These colors all xerox
well; and many copy shops can reduce from the larger sizes to 8.5x11"; it is
much easier to create a crisp drawing in a large scale and reduce it than it
is to try to add detail to a small drawing.

A plotter that will do 11x17 will cost from $400(used) to $1600, while one
that can do 17x22 will cost over $1000 even if I can get one used (does
anyone have a plotter they are going to throw away?).  In both cases, this
is much more than I can justify for deck plans; a laser printer is easier to
justify (I can use it for more things) but it is still out of my price
range.  So I will continue to do them by hand.

Some information from Striker may be useful in some recent TML discussions.
Striker Rule 75: Naval Vessels, says (in part):

"75.C Weapons: ... When conducting direct fire on the battlefield, ship
weapons have the same capabilities and fire control limits as other direct
fire weapons.  When firing from orbit, a forward observer is necessary. ..."

"75.C.3 Missiles: Turret-mounted missiles have warheads equivalent to 15cm
CPR gun rounds; bay-mounted misssiles have warheads equivalent to 25cm CPR
gun rounds.  There are 25 launchers in a 50-ton bay, and 50 launchers in a
100-ton bay.  Ship missiles have the same guidance system types as tac
missiles: they may be target designated, homing, or drone. ..."

"75.C.7 Forward Observers: ... However, ships high overhead (such as those
in orbit), and ships with missiles and meson guns in any positions, may be
guided in their fire by a forward observer.  The observer must have a map
box and a battle computer, and must be in communication with the ship. ..."

The MegaTraveller rule book thoughtfully neglects to provide data for odd
sizes of CPR gun rounds, so you\'ll have to interpolate.  You should probably
use the howitzer table (Striker used only one table, with modifiers for the
type of gun; if I remember correctly, howitzers used no modifiers).  I
would presume that the warhead would be HEAP for anti-ship missiles, but
ground-attack missiles probably offer all types of warheads.

It is not clear what type of guidance system standard anti-ship missiles
have.  I would presume some type of passive homing guidance; however,
"semi-active" (ie: target designated) homing would be a popular option.
High tech missiles may even be have both, with the guidance system selected
at launch time.

I don\'t know about your campaign, but in mine, any ship which had nuclear
anti-ship munitions on board is hardly an "average merchant ship".  The best
designation they could hope for would be "privateer", with "pirate",
"corsair", and even "terrorist" and "criminal" being strong possibilities.

Yep.  Someone here on TML worked out that it was much cheaper (in terms of
lost time; those extra couple of days result is many lost trips per year) to
buy fuel at the starport than to use wilderness refuelling.  Therefore, most
merchant starships will only use wilderness refuelling where *NO* source of
local fuel is available (Naval and Scout forces will, of course, refuell
from local gas giants whenever it suits their missions).

Fuel purification systems may be economical for merchants, especially as
tech level increases.  You have to trade off the decreased cargo revenue
(from the volume that the purifier requires) agains the increased cost of
refined fuel.  In some cases, where the anticipated runs will not have
refined fuel available, the purifier is required for safe operation.

I don\'t think so; it all depends on the relative location of the mainworld,
gas giant, and ice asteroids (if any), as well as the time it takes to mine,
melt, and purify a load of fuel.  How long will it take you to mine, carry,
and melt over 20 metric tons of ice, even working in microgravity?.

I like what I have heard so far.  Perhaps here on TML we can come up with
some better "personality characteristics" for a revised version of the
system; how about some suggestions?  I think the "Morality" statistic should
be replaced with something better - maybe even a couple of somethings.
Perhaps "Compassion", "Conscience" and "Legalism" statistics?

Yes!  It seems that as soon as good, detailed information about aliens
starts to be published, its time to re-arrange the game universe and the
aliens get put on the back burner again.  A Science-Fiction roleplaying game
should have aliens in it; please make this a priority.

That was the scuttlebutt I heard; however, I\'m not sure how successful these
would be.  Although I thought that volume 1 was nice, I\'ve heard far more
negative comments than positive.

> combined scenario / sector sourcebooks, like the Flaming Eye, like the

Or at least matched pairs; a sector sourcebook and a matching campaign
sourcebook.  This way more information could be put into each one, and
people who don\'t intend to use the campaign material won\'t have to pay for
it.

> World Builder\'s Handbook, and the planned Grand Explorations book (how I

Didn\'t hear about Grand Explorations ... but I thought that the World
Builder\'s Handbook was a neccesity.  Since TNE is supposed to stress
exploration and recontact, I should think that an exploration sourcebook
would be a high priority (if not, perhaps it should be; after all, this is
one of the few major area of Science-Fiction literature that both Classic
Traveller and MegaTraveller were weak on).

I like the DGP equipment sheet and task library format very much.  While I
don\'t consider it as high a priority as other parts of the TNE system, I
would certainly pay money for a suppliment composed of nothing but different
pieces of equipment detailed and illustrated on these sheets.

In my opinion, the best way to produce these would be as unbound sheets for
inserting into a looseleaf binder.  This way, each referee can use a blank
sheet to create his or her own equipment sheets and place them in the binder
too (put the blank sheet in the back of the design rules suppliment).  Pages
from a loose-leaf binder can be conviently removed and xeroxed for players to
use.  This approach should also lower production costs, and allow the sheets
to be sold at a reasonable price.

> the lost ones ... they add to the vitality of the game.

Agreed.  And the more freedom each licensee has to be creative and unique,
the better the game will be.  The original idea of granting separate areas
to each company was a good one, as it allowed each to have relatively free
reign withought having to worry that GDW or another company would come along
and contradict a plotline in progress.

I\'d like to see all of Classic Traveller collected, re-edited, and
re-printed.  Heck, I\'d even do it myself, if I could get permission from all
those involved (hint! hint!).  I have some experience through my job with
book-on-demand publishing; and this sort of reprint work seems like a
perfect application.  Using book-on-demand, I believe that I could manage to
pay a reasonable royalty, make a small profit, and keep the final cost under
control.  The only drawback would be that book-on-demand is not compatible
with the way that most book and game distributors work; such reprints would
probably be available only as mail-order.  This may be a feature, not a bug;
it would prevent the reprints from competing directly with TNE.

I think that the Imperium was more like Rome, and will agree with Cynthia
that it will take a good long time to fall (after all, Rome wasn\'t sacked
in a day).  This is why I picked Charlemagne as an example (and yes, I am
aware that he was centuries after the fall of Rome, not decades).

The "Virus" seems to me to be the factor that speeds up the fragmentation
and fall of the empire.  This may also hinder the formation of states to
fill the power vacuums created by the fall of the Imperium.

In your "Alexanderian" model, how about the Solomani for Rome?

    Seeing as this has turned into such a long posting, I will summarise my
points here:

Modularity: Make TNE a core rules system + Imperial sourcebook. Allow for
        other universes in the system.
Stutterwarp: Why does stutterwarp have to be FTL? Don\'t retrofit it.
World Generation: The current system needs tweaking. A few suggestions.
Trade: Something new needed.
The Virus: My $0.02. The virus should be beaten by the time TNE is set.
Thought for the Day: A neat idea which justifies the stutterwarp and defeats
        the Virus in one fell swoop.
The Short Nap: Longer please (the Imperium\'s had a hard day)
The Hivers: Some idle speculation on what the little so-and-so\'s were up to.

Modularity
    Having a core rules system with add-ons to cover various universes (eg.
the Imperium, the 2300AD universe, etc.) is a _good_idea_ IMHO. It would make
sense then to keep the core rules as general as possible (ie. have rules for
character creation, combat, trade, vehicle construction, system generation,
etc.) and include generic equipment which would be common to all Sci-Fi
settings (eg. standard laser weapons, slug throwers, etc.), but not things
such as starships beyond a few examples - they should be kept for the various
universe expansion books.
    Also, the expansion books should contain rules and data, as well as
background information. One of the worst things done with MegaTraveller was
including all the information about the various alien races in the Ref\'s
Companion and then not including any rules ("Hey, these Aslan sound great! 8-)
How do I create an Aslan NPC? 8-( "). If something is going to be done, it
should be done fully - taking the above example, a couple of pages detailing
Aslan character generation would have been really useful, even at the expense
of a couple of pages of description of the Aslan psychology (or whatever). Of
course Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium went to the other extreme and
had equal problems. Even a paragraph of written information about each ship
would have made the book useable. I must say that DGP MegaTraveller products
were in general much more useful than the GDW products, and I think that the
reason was that they got the mix of rules, data and background waffle about
right.
    I like the idea of having supplements dealing with other periods in
Imperial history - Rebellion era, First Imperium, Rule of Man, classic Third
Imperium, the Civil Wars would all make good subjects, as well as alternate
histories (the "We Have Always Been As We Are" suggestion of Martyn Wheeler of
a non-rebellion Imperium, or a non-virus version).

Stutterwarp in the Imperium
    Why not? But if it is going to be introduced into the Imperium without
making massive changes to the flavour of the universe it should not out-
perform the jump drive.

    Indeed, why does it need to be FTL?

    Why not have it merely as a superior form of m-drive? This would solve the
problem that was mentioned of trying to get the 2300AD starship combat system
without the massive effect on the imperial universe. Perhaps one of the
fundamental constants of a universe could well be the relative effectivenesses
of the various FTL travel means (ie. the MegaTraveller system would be jump-6,
stutterwarp-0, stargate-0; for 2300AD it might be jump-0, stutterwarp-7.7,
stargate-0; maybe TNE might have jump-6, stutterwarp-0.0001, stargate-0).
    Perhaps a UUP (Universal Universe Profile) might be in order!
    Stutterwarp should _not_ be retrofitted to Traveller, if it\'s used then it
should be a _new_ development since the hard times (maybe the Hivers or Deneb
came up with something). See below for a neat thought.

World/System Generation
    By far the most useful way of presenting data about worlds (from a game
point of view) was the 1-page format in Knightfall and the various DGP
products, although the system maps were wasteful of space. However, these are
obviously impractical for large-scale universes like the Imperium (the 2300AD
universe could concievably list every colonised system in such a format in a
reasonable space). So keeping the old Traveller system, or something like it,
does seem to make sense.
    However there are some problems with this system, the most notable being
atmospheres: A size 1 world (half the diameter of the moon) can have an
atmosphere of 6 (as dense as the earths. Given that there is a rough
correllation between gravity and atmospheric pressure (from the 2300AD
generation system tables, which are, I think, scientifically accurate for all
worlds bar gas giants), the world would need to have a mass one 64th of the
Earth, and hence a density of 8 times the Earth! Even if it were made of solid
lead or iridium it would not be this dense (from memory the Earth\'s density is
approx. 5 gm/cc, lead\'s is about 13 gm/cc, this planet would need 40 gm/cc).
(Please don\'t flame me if my calculations are wrong. Correct me, sure, but I
am a mathematician, not a physicist! 8-) It is things like this which cause
problems when you try to improve the data on a world you want to use. The
2300AD system was good, but too long-winded for a "simple" system.
    So how could the current traveller UPP system be improved, without
invalidating all the UPP\'s already generated throughout the Imperium?
(allowing for the fact that the Hard Times/Short Nap have totally stuffed a
lot already) Well, you could simply legislate out of existence ridiculous
examples like the one above (I know from AAB Procedings 19 that things are
being changed so that Agricultural worlds are being forced to have reasonably
bright stars).
    Another posibility would be to change that UPP digit to a "Composition"
digit which gives both the density (planetary composition) and atmosphere
(atmospheric composition) somehow. How about something like:

UPP Digit     Planetary Composition
  0,1,2        Icy Body (excepting asteroid belts)
  3,4,5        Rocky Body
  6,7,A        Molten Core
  8,9,B        Heavy Core

              Atmospheric Composition
 1,5,6,8       Standard Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere
 2,4,7,9       Tainted Atmosphere
 0,3,A,B       Exotic, vacuum or otherwise unusual atmosphere

    This should mesh fairly well with existing data and rules systems, but
would provide a better means to then use a World Builders\'-type system to
generate more detail. However, it is a bit of a mess (mainly from trying to
make it fit the previous system), and I don\'t know where to put the existing
atmosphere types C to F. Any suggestions? Anything else anyone objects to in
the current UPP system?
    Oh yes, either the number of gas giants should be reduced, or the
number of available orbits increased - it seems too many systems have gas
giants in the habital zones.

Trade
    I don\'t really like either of the trade systems: the one in classic
traveller was too limited in scope, the one in MegaTraveller was better, but
was a pain to use and unrealistic (all cargoes on a given world cost the
same/ton, whether it was diamonds or grain or hi-tech weaponry you were
trading). Also on low-population worlds, a single starship\'s cargo could have
major effect on trade ("You\'ve got 100 tons of gizmos. Sorry, we got a
shipment last week which should last us for a year..."). Things also started
to break down if the ships got too big: there is virtually no way that a 10000
trading vessel could fill its holds - a population A world could expect to
have approx 200 tons of cargo and another 200 of freight at any given time -
yet there were huge trading megacorporations which managed to make a living
(yes, I know that the trade tables are supposed to reflect what would be
available to the average Free Trader, and that most people would choose to
send their freight by Tukera lines than Bob\'s Free Trader. Nevertheless one
would expect a planet with a population in the billions to have thousands of
times more trade goods available than a planet with a population in the
millions or thousands...)
    This starts to touch on other things discussed elsewhere on TML, on
whether interstellar trade is just in "luxuries" or is wide-ranging and all-
pervasive. The consensus seems to be that the latter is the state of affairs
in the Third Imperium (and hence probably in Deneb in TNE), but my suspicion
is that it will be more likely that the Star Vikings will only trade in
luxuries. I s\'pose that what it boils down to is the _cost_ of interstellar
travel. The higher the cost, the higher the value of the goods must be to make
the profits worthwhile. Somehow, the trade system needs to be able to cope
with both extremes.
    Certainly fixed passenger fares and freight costs have to go: consider
a free trader landing on a world in Deneb, where there is strong interstellar
trade: a berth on such a ship would perhaps cost something like what it does
in the current system. However the same free trader landing on an otherwise
identical planet somewhere out in the old heartlands of the imperium can ask
whatever it likes as the fare, as there will almost certainly be many people
who want out - whether it is to a nicer nearby world, a local capital or all
the way to Deneb... The difference here is that where the costs are high (the
dangers of trading in the old heartlands, the fact that repair etc. is almost
impossible), the price of transport is also high.
    I\'m almost feeling motivated enough about this to write an improved
trade system myself, if university work doesn\'t intervene...

The Virus
    The idea of having a "race" of predatory computer chips destroy the
Interstellar economy is a fairly good one, although I am not 100% sure about
it: there are problems. The foremost of these IMHO is the idea of silicon
chips still being used in the hi-tech Imperium - I was of the impression that
the higher tech computers used various other means ("synaptic processors"
certainly form a significant part of TL15 ship computers, and my vision of
these is not of some special form of silicon chip... that could just be me,
though 8-) I s\'pose that my vision of what a TL 15 computer\'s CPU would look
like is more like Orac from Blake\'s 7 - transparent or translucent
crystalline/plastic boxes (without flashing lights though). However, the idea
of having semi-intelligent chips in ship\'s transponders does get around this
problem to some extent. There are properties of the Cymbeline chips which
would suit them to this purpose. However, to be really effective, the Virus
would have to include aspects much more like a traditional computer virus.
    It would be fittingly ironic if the killer chips were manufactured as part
of Lucan\'s Black War effort to produce a doomsday weapon.
    The Virus is going to make technological advance extremely difficult in
affected areas, however, so that recovery may well be not possible - every
time that a civilisation gets to TL 7 or so, it will almost surely start using
silicon chips, and sooner or later the remnants of the Virus are going to
discover this little treasure trove of silicon, and take over. Thus, the Virus
should have been wiped out or be extremely limited in its range in TNE (How?
Maybe Deneb managed to produce an anti-virus? Silicon chips are extremely
susceptible to hard radiation (nuke-em)? Perhaps sufficient numbers mutated
into a "good" form that fought the Virus and virtually wiped it out) If there
are still Virus "eggs" lying about, or if there are still large numbers of
Virus chips active and there is no effective means of destruction or
pacification, then TNE will _not_ be the dawn of a new age, but merely a dark
struggle, and I think that everyone (including GDW) doesn\'t want that.

Thought for the Day
    What if the stutterwarp drive were the thing that turned the tables on the
Virus. Assuming some way to protect the electronics of a stutterwarp ship from
attack (and the stuttering may well be enough), a stutterwarp powered ship
would utterly abuse any of the non-stutterwarp imperial ships which the Virus
had taken over (in the 2300AD starship combat rules, any non-stutterwarp
driven ship _cannot_ move during combat). If you add something like the slow
build up of hard radiation from the stutterwarp drive being enough to fry any
Cymbeline chip which got aboard, the organic lifeforms have a permanent
military advantage over the Cymbeline chips. Thus the stutterwarp makes the
Virus much less of a threat.
    It also makes the stutterwarp an integral part of the TNE plotline, rather
than a convenient addition to the rules.
    I _like_ this idea 8-) The stroyline might go something like:

    About the same time as the Virus first breaks out (or maybe a bit before),
researchers at the Jumpspace Institute discover a means of inducing micro-
jumps, which although short in distance, only take milliseconds (or less) to
traverse, as opposed to the normal week in jumpspace. It is found that making
rapid, repeated jumps allows for performace far exceeding normal m-drives, but
there appears to be no way of getting the drive to produce FTL speeds. In
addition in gravity wells, performance drops off considerably as smaller jumps
have to be taken to allow for the gravitational field effects, but the time
taken for the jumps does not noticeably change. Hence the ships slow down.
Finally, there is a problem with buildup of radiation (or each jump generates
a electro-magnetic pulse), which although not dangerous to humans, fries many
traditional ship electronic components, such as transponders.
    Realising the military potential of this discovery for the Domain of
Deneb, the development of stutterwarp drive ships are fast-tracked and the
problems with the electronics surmounted by new (and incidentally Virus-proof)
technologies. By the time the Domain of Deneb is threatened by the Virus a
small squadron of fighting ships is ready. This handful of ships then defeats
a Virus Armada coming through corridor. As more ships are produced, similar
actions stop the spread of the virus in the Vargr extents (or maybe the Vargr
extents, left to their own devices, remain a haven for the virus), the Aslan
Heirate (in exchange for the Ihatei to stop their attacks), the Hiver worlds
(or maybe they developed stutterwarp independently), and perhaps some
remaining pockets in the Imperial heartlands. The Virus is no longer a threat
to most of humaniti, but the combination of the rebellion and the Virus has
left virtually the entire Imperial and Solomani empires a mass of devestation.
Once the Virus is under control, Deneb is forced to retreat to repair the
damage it has sustained before it can even think of helping the rest of the
Imperium, the same with most of the other interstellar states.
    It is only now, n years later, that once again Deneb is probing beyond
its borders into the remains of the Imperium, and that Hiver-backed Star
Vikings are starting to trade with former Solomani and Imperial space.
    The new frontier is the Imperial heartland, and it _is_ the dawn of a
new era...

The Short Nap
    I have to agree that 70 years or so is not really long enough for a new
dawn to be underway after such a fundamental collapse. I object on
dramatic/storyline grounds more than historical reasons. It just doesn\'t seem
right that a huge 1100 year old empire comes to a crashing fall, but in less
than 100 years things are starting to get back to normal...
    I s\'pose I should ask if GDW have any plans for Imperial history after
TNE? (with the Rebellion era, it was pretty clear that things were heading for
a total collapse, if not in quite the way it finally happened) Are things
heading towards a 4th Imperium? Or something new? Imperial space divided
amongst Deneb, the Hivers, the Vargr, the Aslan and a few pocket empires?
Presumably a new dawn implies some sort of stable situation appearing on the
horizon.

The Hivers
    Although I doubt the Hivers were responsible for the Virus, I have always
had a nagging suspicion that the Rebellion may have been a Hiver manipulation
on a massive scale (indeed I once vaguely laid out the plans for a campaign
which followed such a plot line - nothing ever became of it). Part of my
reasons for thinking this way is that they kept out of the rebellion, not even
aiding any one particular faction with trade (and a Hiver keeping out of
anything that important seems unusual - mind you, there was a lot of violence
going on). And note that they\'ve come out in what is by far the best position
after the dust has settled. Not that the Hivers are likely to let humans know
the truth about it until they\'ve well and truly finished...
    Just an idle speculation 8-)

Final Comment
    I hope GDW don\'t go off half-cocked on TNE. Even if the release date is
put back or whatever, they should make sure they get it _right_. I wish them
luck, however. The new scenario has potential.

    There, I\'ve probably said enough here to get me flamed to a crisp, but
thanks for bearing with such a long posting (2500 words - and exams are only 3
weeks away!).

The ihatei isn\'t even a real threat without the virus. With the Aslans
plagued by the Virus and Deneb controlling virus-free, stutterwarp ships
there\'s only one way the Aslans are going to get any: As loyal vassals
of Archduke Norris.

It doesn\'t; if carefully done, a "slow" stutterwarp will work; it can be
limited to sublight speeds, or to FTL speeds that are far below that of
jump drives.  As a first cut, try dividing the speeds generated by Star
Cruiser or 2300AD by 10 and see what happens.

>   Perhaps a UUP (Universal Universe Profile) might be in order!

Hey, good idea!  A simple string of digits which summarize many of the
important points of a universe.  How about something like the following

Tone : Rating of the overall tone and character of the universe; low
numbers mean dark, depressing, morbid; high numbers indicate light,
upbeat, hopeful.
Contrast : Rating of the definition between "good" and "evil"; low
numbers indicate that such a conflict is not a fundamental part of the
universe, with the contrast increasing up to the high numbers, where the
conflict between a well defined good and evil is central to the universe
(Star Wars is a good example of this in science fiction).
Scale : Shows the "size" of events in which the players will typically
be involved; low numbers indicate that the events are likely to be
unimportant on a cosmic scale, and of interest to the participants and
a few others.  High numbers indicate world-shattering, star-spanning
plots with strong consequences for entire worlds and billions of people.
Input : This indicates how much influence the players are likely to have
in the course of these events; low numbers indicate that the rebellion
will go on no matter what the players can do.  High numbers represent a
larger player influence on their universe.

Technology: A group of three digits which represents the low, average,
and high end of the technology available in the universe.

Parameters: A group of digits for plugging into equations in design
dequences; represents the type and effectiveness of specifc technologies
in the game universe.  Likeley candidates include Fusion, Gravitics,
Jump Drive, Stutterwarp, Stargates, and as many others as seem
reasonable.

Examples: (in my humble opinion, using a 2-B scale):

Classic Traveller: 9469-AFG-87600
Rebellion Era:     58A3-AFG-67600
Hard Times Era:    4878-9CE-67600
Star Trek TNG:     A79A-???-A90B1
Star Wars:         BABA-???-88A00

I would rather that the whole current system were scrapped and re-done
from scratch, instead of re-defining the existing codes.  I\'m afraid
that I don\'t like the suggestion presented.  A new system and new codes
would be a nice improvement (however, it would mean a commitment on the
part of GDW to generate several sectors right near the start).
Suggestions for such a new system would include separate codes for
worlds size and density, separate codes for atmosphere type and density.
Generating the starport type after figuring out the planet\'s population
and technology level would allow a better "fit" between these three
figures, and would be an important improvement.

The thought had occurred to me, too.  It would be like them to try a
manipulation on this scale (and it would be like an overconfident Hiver
manipulator to not intend to cause this much damage).

In the design sequence, it is assumed that a vessel will have to defeat
  1G of gravity in order to begin moving.  Basically, this ignores
  the concepts of aerodynamics.  For vertical take off and landing,
  a craft is capable of doing without a 1+ G of acceleration.
  This is what taxiing was developed to avoid, and means that
  anyone trying to design a grav-bike or other vessel doesn\'t have
  to use so much power to produce thrust, thus producing cheaper
  and smaller vessels.

To correct this, the easiest (though probably not realistic) method
  would be to stop subtracting 1 from the Gs of acceleration
  produced by the vessel if it is intended for atmospheric use.
  Of course, in less dense atmospheres, or higher gravity worlds,
  the speed or taxiing time would have to be adjusted.  Unfortunately,
  I\'m only an amatuer physicist, so someone else will have to work
  out the exact adjustments.

On planets without atmospheres, the standard 1G loss of effective
  thrust would still apply.

Looks like Gallium Arsenide chips will finally be reasonable.

My Dad does research in Gallium Arsenide Superconducters.  He is
one of the better known researchers in the field. My Sister does
research in Gallium Arsenide Semiconductors.  When they are both
in town, the phrase I hear most often is:

     "Gallium Arsenide -- The technology of the future,
                          as it always will be."

Alternatives to Silicon exist TODAY.  The problem is that
silicon is much cheaper and easier to work with than Gallium
Arsenide or the other substitutes (ErRhBa?  Sigh, I tend to
tune out the physics lecture over the holiday tables.)

I\'m not sure that replacing silicon will actually fix the problem
with the Virus.  Life is insidious, I suspect that the virus would
simply mutate to eat whatever new technology you dreamed up.

While I have an infrequent idle moment, I wanted to address one of
the topics that Corran Webster brought up.  (hi Corran, welcome to
the TML!)

In order for a planet to have an atmosphere, it must be both large enough
and dense enough to be able to capture and retain the gaseous phase
during its formation.  The earth and Venus are the two planets in our
system with significant atmospheres.  Let\'s look briefly at some planet
stats:

planetdiameter, kmmass, gdensity, gm/cc

mercury48783.3e265.44
venus121004.87e275.25
earth127565.98e275.52
moon34767.35e253.34
mars67866.44e263.94

(Well, yeah, the moon is technically a satellite, but compositionally,
it\'s part of the earth/moon "system" and is of the same compositional
geochemical material as the earth\'s lithosphere...I just couldn\'t neglect
it.)

The large satellites of Jupiter vary in size from ~3000 to ~5000 km
diameter, and from ~2 to 3.5 g/cc density, by comparison.

So, it looks like the upper limit for terrestrial planet-sized bodies
is around 5.5 g/cc density, though it certainly is within the realm
of planetary geochemistry to accrete a larger Fe/Ni core to make a
denser planet.  The upper limit for a planetary body would be the
density of pure iron (in this system) or pure nickel (in some other
system), I would suppose, assuming that you could really accrete a
planet without retaining the other elements (which I believe would
be close to impossible, though most of the science in Traveller is
impossible, so why worry about it?)

Anyway, for planetary bodies smaller than the Earth or Venus, a decent
atmosphere is not viable, because the gravity would be insufficient
to retain low vapor pressure gases.

Incidentally, one of the great puzzles of planetary science is why
Venus does not have a significant proportion of water vapor in its
atmosphere.  It is large enough to retain water vapor, but yet its
atmosphere is mostly CO2.  The science types are still arguing about
it...

Now about Corran\'s proposed UPP scale, based mostly on planetary
composition, which translated to rocks, solid cores, molten cores,
etc.  I would like to make a small correction to his view of
planetary composition.

When you have planetessimals colliding to make terrestrial style
planets, there are a number of compounds available which can be
classified as siderophilic (mostly iron/nickel), lithophilic (oxides
and silicates), chalcophilic (oxides and sulfides), and atmosphilic
(low  vapor pressure compounds, in the forms of ices).  These
four broad categories are the left-overs from accreting a
sun.  They hang out as planetessimals and get busy colliding
and accreting.  As they accrete, they segregate by density.
The siderophilic (ie iron-loving) elements sink into a core (always
molten at first).  The lithophics form a mantle.  The chalcophilics and
some of the oxides float to the top.  The atmosphilics try their damndest
to outgas.  The heat of collision drives the atmosphilics into a vapor
phase.  If the body is large enough and dense enough, the vapor phases
can\'t escape, and form an atmosphere.

So essentially, every terrestrial planet has a siderphilic (ie iron-rich)
core topped by a lithophilic (ie silicate-rich) cap.  The lighter oxides
and sulfides may not be present, depending on whether the growing planet
was large enough to capture the lighter, less-abundant planetissimals
as it accreted.  (This is a simplistic model, especially when you consider
that Io, at 3640 km diameter, is sulfide rich!  I suppose the moral of
the story is that coincidence probably plays a large role in the capture
of planetissiamals...)

Now every core is molten to begin with.  What keeps a core molten is
governed by how many radioactive elements sank with the other siderophiles
in forming the core, and how big the planet is.  The radioactive elements
decay and give off heat, keeping things warm in the core.  The planet size
governs how fast the heat of the core is lost.  The bigger the planet,
the slower the heat loss.

The Moon is not just a rock.  It has a solid iron/nickel core (once
molten, now cooled), and an outer layer of lithophilic silicates (which
are identical in isotopic signiture to the earth\'s silcate mantle!).
Venus still has a partially molten core, like the Earth\'s.  We know
this for certain now, since the Magellan data has confirmed that
mantle convection occus on Venus (and hot cores drive mantle convection).

I know this post is getting really long, but you hard core science
fiction types may want to take a look at the Magellan data.  It\'s
been published in two special "green-cover" Journal of Geophysical
Research (JGR) issues dated this year.  Really cool pictures, folks!
The first good pictures ever made of the surface of Venus (done with
radar imaging).  Check it out!  The pictures alone are worth your
while.

Anyway, back to planet cores.  Any really old terrestrial planet,
regardless of size, will lose the heat of its core eventually, and
the core will solidify.  The point: solid vs molten core is a function
of age and size and radioactive content, so I would amend Corran\'s
scheme and lump the solid and molten core planets together.  I think
I would devide the UPP\'s to relect whether a planet was large enough
to retain an atmosphere able to sustain life instead.

Corran\'s observation that gas giants were often "conveniently" close
to terrestrial planets is a very good one.  The way elements segregate
in a forming solar system means that the gas giants will be farther out
and the terrestrial planets will be further in.  Gas giant shouldn\'t be
close to the terrestrial planet zone, at least as we understand planetary
science today.  This doesn\'t mean, of course, that a gas giant can\'t
have satellites that are terrestrial planetary bodies, because they
can and do, as the satellites of Jupiter amply demonstrate.

Overall, I think Corran\'s idea of UPPs for planets is a good one.  I\'d
like to see something like it for Traveller.  And with that parting
comment, I\'ll quit boring all you good folk with this latest nerd-attack
of mine... ;->  (Gee, Scott, I guess geology is good for something
afterall!)

Right.  Such a laser probably has a targetting mode where it fires more
rapidly at a *MUCH* lower energy.  This could be built into many types of
"single-shot" pulse lasers at not much additional cost; in others it could
be supplied by a cheap solid-state continous wave or rapid-pulse laser as a
targetting device.

That sounds interesting; as far as I know, there are very few paintball
places around here, and no indoor ones.  Photon is, however, a relatively
popular trip for our Explorer Post (I am an assistant advisor for EP250) so
I get to go about as often as we can afford to.  The scouts are interested
in paintball, so if you could give me any pointers towards a nearby,
affordable place (affordable to the average suburban teenager with no
accumulated equipment), I would be grateful.

Photon has quite a number of problems; every once and a while someone talks
about coming up with a competing game that fixes most or all of them.  The
ones that bug me the most are the helmets, the lack of visual effects, and
the frequent delay in the audio feedback.  Although I haven\'t played in many
different arenas, the size and layout makes quite a difference; I suspect
that the Baltimore Arena is about as small as is practical.  I do know that
I didn\'t enjoy the only smaller one I have played in.

True, and marksmanship doesn\'t count for much in Photon; the gun has an
acceptance angle wider than a 12 gauge\'s shot pattern.  And at least in the
Baltimore Arena, the things have no sights worth mentioning.

Keep in mind that the thrusters can be overdriven by at least 500% for short
periods of time (short in a space combat time scale; this could be as long
as several minutes).  For our hypothetical 1g trader, this means a 2g
lateral accelleration, and a 5g forward sprint.  For a 6g combat craft, this
means a 12g lateral accelleration, and a 30g (!) sprint; such a craft would
be more limited by the intertial compensator\'s ability to keep the pilot
from being mashed into goo than anything else.  Presumably the compensator
is a gravitic device, and can be overdriven like the drives can.  I also
assume that overloading the drives and compensator like this consumes large
amounts of power.

In my opinion, this ability is the basis for the agility measure of a
spacecraft.  A craft with no additional power available to overdrive its
thrusters and compensator has no agility; its ability to make rapid, drastic
changes in its position and vector are extremely limited.  When additional
power is available, a ship has agility: in the case of a 6g combat ship, 100
seconds of 30g accelleration means a displacement of 150km (and a velocity
vector change of 3km/s)!

With respect to agility, I don\'t follow the standard MegaTraveller rules.
Instead I use my own:  Agility is limited to the maneuver drive rating (ie:
a ship with Maneuver=1 has a maximum of Agility=1).  Emergency Agility is
computed based on the assumption that all available power from weapons and
screens is routed to the drives.  For merchants, auxiliaries, and other
underpowered designs, this usually results in an emergency agility no better
than their normal agility.  Emergency agility is also limited to the
maneuver drive rating.  Finally, for ships with a large proportion of cargo,
stores or fuel, agility may be computed for different configurations, as the
mass of the vessel changes.  These are handled on a case-by-case basis.

When maneuvering in space, there is no reason why the spaceship has to keep
its nose pointed along its current velocity vector; this is in sharp
contrast to an aircraft.  The most efficient means of turning is to point
the main drive in the right direction and blast away.

In the description below, the "nose" of the craft is at the front of the
roll axis, which is also the thrust axis of the main drive.  The yaw axis
points up and down (up defined relative to the pilot) at a 90 degree angle
to the roll axis. The pitch axis points port and starboard, (also defined
relative to the pilot) at a 90 degree angle to the roll and yaw axes.

Probably most pilots would start a turn by rolling the craft into the plane
of the turn (so that the yaw axis points to the center of the turn) and
pitching up.  As the ship passes its intended vector heading, the main drive
is run up to the desired thrust.  Pitch-up continues, sometimes up to 180
degrees as the main drive is used to change the ship\'s velocity vector.

As the velocity vector approaches the desired heading, the pilot pitches the
craft down, towards the new heading, possibly decreasing the main drive
thrust to the desired cruise output.  Delicate adjustments can be made to
the final vector by using pitch and yaw.  Precise piloting would establish
the new vector without overshooting or yaw corrections, and would leave the
ship with its nose pointed along the new velocity vector.

From this position, the main drive could be used to accellerate the ship
along its new course; a simple 180-degree pitch or yaw maneuver will allow
the ship to "swap ends" and decellerate, or another turn can be started.  In
some situations, "barbecue mode" may be desirable.  This is where the ship
is placed in a continous slow roll; this may be done to allow sensors or
weapons to sweep through 360 degrees, or to equalize thermal effects, or to
mimic gravity.  If "barbecue mode" is started, the roll will have to be
stopped before any course changes.

In an atmosphere, a spacecraft\'s performance will be affected by its hull
streamlining (or lack thereof).  Way back in the early days of Classic
Traveller, Paranoia Press published the Serpent Class Scout/Courier.  One of
the interesting features of this ship was variable-geometry (swing-wing)
wing and tail surfaces.  I have always assumed that an "AF" (airframe) hull
implies aerodynamic lifting and control surfaces of some type; such craft
would all be able to use wing lift to help them turn.  They may be variable
geometry like the Serpent Class, or lifting bodies, or relatively
conventional airframes like the current Space Shuttle.

There is no reason that winged spacecraft and grav vehicles operating inside
an atmosphere could not maneuver using wing lift.  Vehicles without wings,
in particular many spacecraft and grav vehicles would have to use engine
thrust to perform the turns.  Grav vehicles would have their grav plates
oriented so that the primary axis of thrust is down or at an angle down and
aft (so that the vertical component provides the lift to keep the craft
airbourne, and the horizontal component maintains level cruising speed).
Such craft could turn the same way aircraft do, by banking into the turn and
increasing their grav module\'s output.

The thruster plates on a spacecraft are probably oriented based on a
compromise between atmospheric operations (flight in a world\'s atmosphere
and scooping operations on a gas giant) and convenient take-off and landing
operations, and convenient deep space operations.  Ships for which
atmospheric operations are the most important part of their mission
(including world interface and fuel shuttles, fighters which have an
atmospheric mission, or vessels which are expected to frequently scoop for
fuel) will probably have AF hulls, with aerodynamic lifting surfaces and
flight controls, and thruster plates oriented along their line of flight.

Most other types of ships which are intended to land on a world would use
type SL hulls, and have their thruster plates aligned to provide thrust
perpendicular to their decks and landing gear (so that the thrusters provide
the most thrust as "lift" in atmospheric flight).  This also allows ships
to land and taxi comfortably with their decks level.  When maneuvering in
space, flight attitude is mostly irrellevant.

Unstreamlined craft (type USL) are not intended to in an atmosphere at all;
I typically rule that except for planetoids (which may not land on a world
at all), they may operate in an atmosphere as long as their speed is kept
below 120kps.  Thruster plates on these designs are typically oriented for
maximum convenience; if regular landings are anticipated the thrusters will
be providing "lift" for flight, so the landing gear, decks, and access will
be aligned accordingly.

Allowing the scoutship\'s thrusters to be overdriven by 500% for short
periods of time, my agility modification would allow a Maneuver=2, Agility=2
ship to pull up to 10g for short periods of time (however, again using my
modification, the most a typical scoutship of Maneuver=2, Agility=0 ship
could manage is 2g).  Airframe hulls would be able to contribute some wing
(or body) lift to the turn, too.

The engine thrust to weight ratio for modern combat aircraft can slightly
exceed 1:1 (or about 1g of accelleration) for high-performance jets at full
thrust (usually this means with the afterburners lit) with moderate loads
(air-to-air missiles and fuel only).  Planes in this category include the
F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, all models of the Harrier, the French
Mirage 2000, and the Russian Yak-36mp Forger (and possibly the MiG-21/bis
Fishbed).  Most other aircraft have a much lower thrust to weight ratio;
these aircraft weight many times more than their engine thrust.

The Harrier and the Forger are unique in that they have rotatable nozzles to
direct the engine thrust downwards, so that they can take off and land
vertically; they are sometimes called "jump-jets", V/STOL (Vertical or Short
Take-Off and Landing) or STOVL (Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing)
aircraft.

When an aircraft turns, it uses its wings, not its engine, to alter its
flight path.  The airplane banks into the turn, and the lift from the wings
provides the force which turns the aircraft.  A modern combat jet can
generate lift forces up to nine times the aircraft\'s weight.  This force
does not come without cost, however; producing this lift also causes drag
which slows the aircraft down, and increases its minimum (stall) speed.  The
following table may help, it shows stall speed in knots (nautical miles per
hour), angle of bank in degrees, and g load for a hypothetical aircraft:

Stall Speed:   120   170   208   240   268   294   317   339   360
Angle of Bank: level  60.0  70.6  75.5  78.5  80.4  81.8  82.8  83.6
G Load:          1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9

Nine g is about the practical limit for human pilots in g-suits (at least
until someone invents the intertial compensator); therefore manned aircraft
are rarely stressed for higher loads than this (research aircraft are an
exception, I believe that the Bell X-1 was stressed for up to 12g in either
direction).  Missiles and drone aircraft can also exceed the 9g "limit"
quite easily.

A spacecraft maneuvering in outside the atmosphere is a whole different ball
of wax; there is no air, no lift - no aerodynamic forces whatsoever.  Any
forces which act on a ship have to come from the ship\'s engines.  There are
similarities, because both an aircraft and a spacecraft need to be able to
control their motion in all three dimensions.

Scott Kellogg, please correct me if I made any horrible errors in the above;
I\'m not a pilot, just a pilot-wanna-be, simulations programmer, and gamer!

> we may have something more like options on a computer
> console (it would be quite complex to maneuver a large bulk in zero-g)

I don\'t think so.  There is nothing inherently more difficult about
maneuvering any large mass in zero-g than maneuvering the same large mass
here on Earth.  The required judgement and reflexes will be *DIFFERENT* but
not impossible to learn nor out of the scope of human abilities.

In many ways this sounds like the quest for "inherent stability" which
several early heavier-than-air flight experimenters got hung up on.
Stabilizing a moving vehicle in three dimensions was considered so difficult
as to be beyond human ability; therefore any such aircraft would have to be
inherently stable under any flight condition without human control input.

All of our space-flight experience to date has shown that human judgement
and skill is up to the task of flying spacecraft; I don\'t see why larger
spacecraft and higher technology should change this.

Finally, direct human control is exciting and involving from a story-telling
point of view.  And since we are, in the end, telling stories and not
predicting the future, this is the final and most important criteria.  In my
opinion it is simply more exciting have a pilot fly the starship with some
type of flight controls.  It is draws the players more into the game and
their characters to say "the ship is overloaded; you wrestle with the
controls and it responds sluggishly" than to say "the computer informs you
that docking will be delayed because the ship is overloaded".

prising most of the defunct Terran Confederation. It is, depen-
ding on what historian you ask,  either one of the first or one
of  the  last  parts  of the Rule of Man to succumb to the Long
Night. It was one of the first areas to loose contact with Hub;
in  -1854  the  second new governor sent out from Hub failed to
reach the province\'s capital, Dingir, and Acting Governor Ayara
Twofeathers  inaurgurated the custom of Governor-appointed suc-
cessors,  a  system  that was kept to the end of the provincial
government.
    The lessening flow of commerce between the rim and the core
were already rendering taxes more and more meaningless,  and 16
years later the province ceased to remit taxes to Hub except on
an intermittent basis. For a while Dingir tried to keep up pay-
ments  in  the  form of precious metals and gems,  but when the
third  of the treasure fleets carrying these payments failed to
return, these too were discontinued.
    On the other hand, the government at Dingir kept ruling "in
the  name  of  the  Emperor"  for  another  century and a half,
keeping  the  peace  and enforcing Rule of Man regulations.  It
collapsed  finally in -1690,  when a huge budget deficit forced
the government to decommision two thirds of the already decima-
ted  provincial  fleets  and  turn  over  the  rest  to various
individual planets and the Terran Mercantile Community (qv.).


TERRAN MERCANTILE COMMUNITY:  Loose trade association formed in
- -1862  by  Terra and her closest colonies, that later grew into
a corporation.  Ostensibly a purely commercial organisation, it
was  actually a means of circumventing Rule of Man prohibitions
against member planets having their own navies. The TMC built a
merchant  fleet  that  toed a very fine line between commercial
ships  and naval vessels.  The ships carried enough armament to
protect themselves from pirates and raiders,  but not enough to
classify them as naval vessels. Their merchant fleet made Terra
and her fellow worlds in the TMC a formidable commercial force.
    When  the Rule of Man in the form of the Rim Province (qv.)
collapsed in -1690, The Terran Mercantile Community had a space
fleet to patrol it\'s systems and to replace the now gone Second
Empire  fleets.  The TMC\'s merchant fleet cushioned the blow of
the  Long Night  and  made  it possible for Terra to survive in
relative comfort.
    The  TMC took over many of the functions of the Rule of Man
(though  abandoning the extreme edges of the old Rim Province),
but  were  careful at first not to assume the mantle of govern-
ment.  By  avoiding the appearance of ruling it avoided aliena-
ting  the other planets and driving them into forming their own
unions. Relying on the protection of the TMC ships were cheaper
than building their own,  and the TMC itself was careful not to
be percieved as a threat.
    For  several  centuries  the  TMC  managed to maintain this
delicate balance, but the steadily worsening commercial climate
eventually  forced them to retrench.  Like the Rim Province be-
fore  it,  the  TMC found the strain of protecting the furthest
worlds too much of a burden. Other Rule of Man successor states
in Dark Nebula, Alpha Crucis, Magyar and Reaver\'s Deep routine-
ly raided worlds on the fringe of the TMC sphere,  but although
this was a contributing strain,  it was not the primary factor.
The  Reaver\'s Era  (see Reaver\'s Deep)  ended before the end of
the TMC,  and Reaver attacks in any case concentrated on fringe
worlds  that  had  already  been  abandoned by the TMC and lost
interstellar  technology.  The  primary factor was economic de-
pression and a widespread trend toward isolationism,  causing a
shift to planetary self-reliance at the expense of interplanet-
ary trade.
    When  the  worlds  near  Easter  in -1112 formed the Easter
Concord  and  other  worlds  began talking of forming their own
unions,  the TMC decided to cut its losses. In -1110 the corpo-
ration formally transformed into the Old Earth Union,  abandon-
ing all worlds outside the Union to their own devices,  and be-
coming a small, tight group instead of a large, loose one.
    See also: Old Earth Union.

I\'m sure some such sub-division existed).

Well, I\'d pick them up!  In the same note, a friend of mine said that
if she ever won the lottery, she\'d try to buy the rights to traveller,
so that she could get new copies of her old stuff.

I like the system maps.  I have a group of players who try to pick
where they are going to end up in the destination system.  It takes
them longer to get to jump, but it makes them happy.

I think that having lots of information can be really fun.  My players
became really conserned about a planet that was listed in the data
sheets, printed on the large sector overview map, but not shown on
the subsector map. (1706 Spinward Marches, Alell fyi)  Since Efate has
an Imperial waystation,  they found trouble.  They like information,
the more they get the happier they are.

A couple points:
Hans points out that the obvious defence to the silicon
predators viruses is have non silicon chips.

Well, guess what?  He\'s absolutely right.
As a matter of fact, I\'d say a computer with silicon chips may
be common now, but supercomputers, (especially ones in the future)
will use silicon as the EXCEPTION not the rule.

Silicon as a semiconductor, is NOT the way to go.  I may not be
up on computer architecture, but don\'t most supercomputers use
Gallium Arsinide chips now?

Admittedly, Gallium Arsinide has nasty problems, as a semiconductor
(requires liquid nitrogen cooling)  But the next generation of
semiconductors will be Silicon Carbide.  Silicon Carbide chips will
be faster, more radiation hard, and will withstand temperatures
that will fry a silicon chip.

The step after Silicon Carbide will be Diamond semi-conductors.
Diamond is an EXCELLENT semiconductor:  Ideal for computer
applications.  Fast, Radiation hard, TOUGH, and it can function
as a semiconductor under the tip of an acytlene torch.  (A couple
thousand degrees :-)

They estimate diamond semiconductors will be available in less than
ten years.  Probably less than 5.

Believe me, having traveller computers on silicon chips is kinda like
saying the starships are powered by fuel injected V-8 engines.  If
That were the case, then Lucan\'s supervirus should eat all the
petrochemicals in the galaxy and everybody waits forever at the gas
pumps...  :-)

----
Wildstar talked a bit about starships flying with lift:
Nope.  Won\'t work.

Why?  Wing loading.

The average scoutship weighs in at 1000 + metric tons.  I don\'t have my
books with me, but I believe thats around twice the weight of a fully
loaded B-52.  Yet it has about the same wing area of an F-4 Phantom.
Will it fly?  No.  It just can\'t get enough lift from air alone.  You
have to have some thrust from the engines to keep it up.

Otherwise it\'s natural stall speed will be somewhere in the hypersonic
region, and it will have the glide angle of a crowbar.  :-)

Other than that, yer right (as far as I know)  :-)

That was a *very* informative message on planetary development!

A few questions...

Can you run through a similiar scenario for a Gas Giant?  How does a Gas Giant
elvolve without a heavy core?

Does Venus have higher or lower proportions of iron/nickel, silicon oxides, &
sulfur oxides?  My understanding is that Venus does have plenty of sulfur
oxides, but I\'m not sure about silicon oxides.  With all this and CO, it seems
that Venus has all the basic building blocks of life, except maybe H???

The difference in Venus I assume, is that the temperature is so hot that O2 is
not stable, it quickly combines with C, Su, or Si.  Since there are no plants
to create O2 it must have anaerobic life if any, like a few of Earths
microorganisms.  If you could cool venus off, and seed some plants, you could
break up to CO, and create O2 and C-?.  does Fe, Ni, Si, or Su combine readily
with C? You really need that H for life, or are there alternatives?  H is such
an adaptable little bugger, you can stick it in anywhere.  If you have the C, H
& O (sounds like a railroad!), you\'ve got it made.

What then happens to the remaining Fe, Ni, Si & Su?  Well, on Earth most of the
Fe/Ni is in the core, and what little is left doesn\'t bother most people.  We
have plenty of SiO silica lying around, and that\'s ok.  I don\'t know about the
Su, though, Sulfa is a pretty antiseptic compound, right?  Su+C+H+O are all
those smelly compounds, right?

Iron is the heaviest common element because Solar Fusion stops at Iron, right?
Where are the other elements O, Si, Su, Ni, C in the Solar Fusion Sequence?
I know that H is at the beginning :-)  I know that super heavy elements come
from novas and super novas, but where are the other micellaneous elements
created?

As the different weights of elements are seperated in a planets crust, with
Fe/Ni on the bottom or core, then the Si, then the Su, and Gases, aren\'t the
elements also seperated to some extent solar-ly?  Ie heaviest elements toward
the sun, lighter elements out toward the gas giants?  Then how does the star
get all it\'s H fuel?  Is this why Venus doesn\'t have enough H?  Or is it
chance?

What would Earth\'s temperature be in Venus\'s orbit?

What\'s wrong with Mars?  Is it because it\'s core is dead, or because it\'s too
light, or is it missing some element?

You mentioned that planetary cores get their heat from radioactive elements;  I
had always thought that it was from gravity.

How does the satellites of Gas Giants hang onto their heavy elements, and keep
them from being sucked up by the gas giants?

How are planets/satellites formed, anyway?  I know some chunks get sucked into
orbit, but can a satellite acreete in orbit.  I guess that matter condenses
into given orbits just like planets, but that would give you a ring, more or
less, rather then a discrete body.  Or do certain points attract the matter
like lagrange points?  Or do chunks scoop up the rest of the matter in the
orbit as it goes around?  But then aren\'t all the stuff in an orbit tavelling
at the same speed by definition?

Is the sun mostly H & He, or does it have a lot of the heavier elements too?
Perhaps a forming sun collects all elements, but then centrifuges off the
heavier ones, which then fall into different orbits and form planets?

Sorry about all the dumb disorganized questions, but I had a lot of them, and
not a lot of time to spit them out...

There is a problem with this idea:  piracy.  Piracy is an idea well loved
by GDW and most Traveller GMs, and stutterwarp will do bad things to it.
Consider that, even with no FTL, a stutterwarp ship can reach the 100-
diameter limit in about three minutes.  This is going to make it EXTREMELY
difficult for pirates to make a (dis)honest living.  After all, even if their
ships are stutterwarp as well, that still leaves them only three minutes to
detect, close to weapon range, and disable a target before it jumps away.
And assuming the pirate was a miracle worker who could DO this, then he finds
himself only three minutes from the nearest Naval vessel in orbit around the
world his target just left.  So now he has to LOOT the ship within three
minutes, after defeating it in a fight within three minutes.

Sounds tough...

Yes, I\'d agree.  It is the case, however, that the "Anastasia,"
registered at Spirelle as a Merchant Cruiser, does have quite a large
nuclear arsenal on board.  The missiles were in the magazine when they
found the ship, and thanks to some clever fraternising with the Scout
Base the vessel was not inspected in detail when they registered it
under salvage law.  Since then, the ship has been used about
half-and-half for speculative merchant trading and for deep military
reconnaisance; in spirit, though, it is definitely being run as a free
trader.
    (Actually, the ship was the original Kinunir, upgraded to fit MT
design rules.  This makes it 2kt displacement, with some high-tech
stuff in engineering, including some really funky jump drives.  It had
crash-landed on Spirelle some 30 years ago, and the characters ran
into it while vacationing at a posh resort.  Baling out of a stricken
scout/courier at several thousand feet was not their idea of a
vacation, however...)
    They have never used nukes inside the Imperium (very wise!),
although they have launched quite a few in the year and a half they
have been outside its boundaries.  As I recall, being good Imperial
citizens, they used conventional missiles until nukes were used
against them first.  They did use a few salvos against enemy ground
forces when they rescued some stranded marines, but as it was a
parting shot on the way out of orbit the detailed effects were not too
important at the time.  They do have a good Forward Observer in the
crew.
    Mild efforts to obtain replacement missiles have failed so far,
but since they only have two of the four missile turrets operational
(and those are patched heavily after a very brief encounter with a
50kt battleship) they are not really running out yet.  Now that they
are intending to return to the Imperium for at least a visit, they
will have less opportunity to use them anyway.  They are actually far
more concerned with keeping the jump drives together, as the annual
maintenance is long overdue and there are no suitable shipyards in
this backward area.  They do, however, seem to be considering coming
back out here later on...

(Sometime I might consider uploading the log of my campaign, which has
just completed 2 game years -- the last session covered the New Years
Eve party as they welcomed in 1119 (long live Strephon!).  Some of you
might be interested.)

Are we talking likelihood or concevability here? I\'d certainly accept
it if GDW decreed that no medium-TL substitute for silicon chips is
possible, but it\'ll be an acceptance based on "what\'s good for the game"
not on what I consider likely. Remember that there\'s a huge difference
between "discovery on Earth TL" and true TL. Some time ago I was
watching an interwiev with a research scientist at RISO, the Danish
atomic research center. I _think_ he was talking about bucky-balls,
but I may misremember. In any case it was some brand-new interesting
discovery. And I remember that at one point he said that they were making
these thingamajigs using machines that could haver been build in the
thirties if the knowledge had been there.

The concept that given the need human scientists couldn\'t come up with
an adequate TL 7 substitute for silicon chips seems to me about as
likely as the flat galaxy bit.

I disagree. But one could easily imagine that any substitute would be
bulkier and more expensive, so interstellar travel could very well
become uneconomic.

No, but they could sure clean up the Aslans\' act on their side of the

Definitely.  Presumably the Imperium continued to use silicon because the
available alternatives were more expensive and more difficult to use.
Therefore, a "virus-proof" computer would probably be larger, more
expensive, and be produced in fewer numbers, than computers were during the
days of the Imperium.

If changes like this are made, I\'d like to see the whole UPP and world
generation rules re-designed, instead of trying to "retro-fit" it into the
current codes.

What do you think of codes for World Type (indicates core type and general
density range), World Size (as in the current system), Atmosphere Type (type
of gas mix) and Atmosphere Density (pressure).  Some attempts at coding are
listed below (I\'m way outta my field here, so go ahead and flame me):

World Type:
0 = Rubble (small rock, iron, or ice chunks)
1 = Ice Asteroids (asteroids with high ice, low rock and metal content)
2 = Rock Asteroids
3 = Metal (Iron) Asteroids
4 = Low-Density Planet (under about 3 g/cc; typical of moons)
5 = Average-Density Planet (3-5 g/cc)
6 = High-Density Planet (over 5 g/cc)

World Size (maybe finally convert this to thousands of kilometers rather
than thousands of miles?)

Atmosphere Type (by primary gas in mix):
0 = No Atmosphere
1 = Carbon Dioxide
2 = Carbon Dioxide w/ "Taint"
3 = Oxygen-Nitrogen
4 = Oxygen-Nitrogen w/ "Taint"
5 = Exotic
6 = Exotic w/ "Taint"
7 = Corrosive
8 = Insidous

In the above "Taint" indicates the presence of something which requres
caution beyond the normal for that atmosphere type; an irritant, mild
pathogen, or some other such problem.  A world comfortable tempratures and a
1atm Carbon Dioxide atmosphere should require only an oxygen mask.  Such a
world with a "Taint" might require a face mask or an environment suit to
protect visitors.

Somehow, I managed to drop a factor of 10 there (see what I get for writing
when I should be sleeping).  That should be 1,500km and 30km/sec.  I hate it
when I do that!

    'body' => '  Using TCS (my thanks to Wildstar and Steve and Cynthia) and some basic
assumptions about salaries, profits and costs, I have done some thinking
about starport/shipyard economics that suddenly yielded one surprising
mechanism.

  Assuming a static total tonnage in the Imperium, the shipyards must divide
their space into doing the yearly overhaul and building ships to replace those
who go away (through age or destruction).

  The yearly overhauls do not require that large a contingent of labour, so it
can accept a normal 25% vacancy, the breakeven is at 45% vacancy. Construction
(and repair) on the other hand is very sensitive to slumps and the breakeven
occurs at around 20% to 25% vacancy, and to give the same percentage of profit
it need a practically 0% of vacancy. This is easily accomplished through
building small crafts for sale when a vacancy appears. Construction, while
riskier, will however give much larger profits per ton of shipyard capacity
than overhauls.

  Repairs have the same demands in labour as construction and gives a profit
in between of construction and overhauls. I assume that repairs take place on
the 25% of overhaul space that normally is available.

  Now, imagine the rebellion: Not only will the naval fleets require repairs
in large numbers, but the targetting of commercial shipping and general
raiding will drive the demand for repairs through the roof.
  Since repairs are more profitous than overhauls, these repairs will steal
space from overhauls. All shipyards will hire like crazy to keep up. And ships
will have to go without overhaul. The places they can get overhaul on are
limited to same or higher TL and type A starport (repairs can be done on other
places) so they can\'t go somewhere else.
  When large numbers of ships go without overhaul, they will start breaking
down partially or catastrophically which further raises the demand for
repairs and lowers the availability of overhaul.

  The repairs will lessen the profitability of interstellar trade enough to
drive most operators out of business, and many ships are lost though the
catastrophic malfunctions.
  One might think that it would stabilize somehwere, since when the number of
ships goes down, the demand for repairs go down and the availability of
overhaul go up. But since repairs require more labour than overhaul huge
numbers will be laid off, at the same time as the economic winds down due to
lack of shipping.

  It is possible that this is enough to break the economy totally.

I\'m not sure where you get your vacancy guestimates here, but:

Trin, Rhylanor, Mora, and Glisten can between them, maintain just over
1,000,000,000T of shipping, either merchant or miitary.  When the
economy shifts to wartime levels, that will jump to 1,200,000,000T of
shipping.  Given TCS rules on repairs, maintenance, whatnot, those yards
could maintain 400,000,000T PLUS of shipping, and repair every one of
them once EVERY year.  Given that their military strength starts at no
more than 250,000,000 (which is a reasonable estimate given TCS rules),
then those four worlds, by themselves, could support 150,000,000T of
merchantmen, and keep up with repairs on EVERY ship in their fleets.
Every year.  These four worlds, BTW, amount to about 25% of the Imperial
yard space in the Spinward Marches.  So the Marches should reasonably be
able to support 600,000,000T of merchant ships, even during normal
wartime.  Without bothering to expand capacity beyond normal levels.

And the Spinward Marches is a backwater.  The Solomani Rim can support
ten times that level of shipping.  Until things have reached the point
that most ships have a useful lifespan of less than two years, the yard
space available shouldn\'t have any meaningful effect on the available
forces.

BTW, in my TCS game, after seven battles, involving perhaps 5000 ships
total, only two yards in the Islands are full.  And neither of them was
involved in the battles.  The ships damaged in combat seldom filled the
yards up for more than a week or two, and only one power felt the need
to discontinue his ship-building program while he repaired battle
damage.  And in his case, it wasn\'t that he had so many ships damaged,
he had his yards blown away.  And a year later, his yards are still only
operating at half capacity, and are still big enough that he has yard
space available to build ships for his allies...

You can attack this from both ends.
  - Fudge StutterWarp to be less powerful, AND/OR
  - Change the TRAVELLER JUMP scale from 1 hex=1 parsec to 1 hex=10 parsecs.
    (I don\'t think that such a change would cause too much trouble and
     it could open up the rest of the universe for 3D exploration)

I believe that this was addressed in GURPS SPACE but I don\'t have the
book with me.  They gave a streamlined ship (ie lifting surfaces) some %
bonus on G rating so a less than 1G rated drive could lift from a 1G
planet.

Actually, GURPS SPACE sounds a lot like what GDW are trying to write.
A generic TRAVELLER rule set that can be used in any space game/universe.

The simplest solution to this would be to slow down StutterWarp in-system
and change the 100 diameter rule to 1,000.  You could really complicate
this by having StutterWarp not work at all within a certain range of a
planet and force use of standard TRAVELLER in-system drives.

Come to think of it, you will need them anyway because (someone said earlier)
StutterWarp doesn\'t alter your basic real-space speed and vector so you will
need some way to match velocity and vector with any planet you want to visit.
Would someone with the StutterWarp rules care to check how they currently do
this.

The more I try to convince myself that StutterWarp can fit into TRAVELLER
the more I find myself shaking my head and wondering why we should bother
fudging both systems to make them fit together.

Put simply, StutterWarp is designed for 3D flits from system to system and
it has a 2D in-system battle format that everyone seems to like; while JUMP
Drive is a 2D inter-system transport mode with limitted in-system combat
mechanics which people would like to see improved.

Perhaps something completely new is needed which combines the good points of
both systems in one (?) Drive which won\'t significantly conflict with how we
have been role playing these items.

JUMP Drive seems fine the way it is but the in-system stuff should be tuned
to work like StutterWarp Combat does but not with StutterWarp Drives.  Simply
introduce an in-system combat system that uses the TRAVELLER in-system Drives
with the same basic mechanics as the StutterWarp system while maintaining
appropriate scales.  Personally, I don\'t like having to use energy beams
on _all_ combat.  I prefer to have a nice meaty missile hit rather than some
arcade style mind-in-the-missile shoot-em-up with lasers or det-missiles.

Also, from what I\'ve heard about the ship design system for 2300AD they\'ve
already designed themselves into a corner with their 0-9 screens and
armour already being at maximum for some Kafer ships; where do you go from
there.

That\'s enough from me, catch you later.

I actually stole these classifications from the World Builders\'
Handbook by DGP, in a vague attempt to fit in with some previously
published information. The World Builders\' Handbook basically uses
these to split planets up into density categories:
Icy body = 0.18 to 0.48 earths
Rocky Body = 0.50 to 0.80 earths
Molten Core = 0.82 to 1.12 earths
Heavy Core = 1.10 to 2.25 earths

OK, let\'s try discarding the idea of whether or not the core is molten
or not, and just stick with categories such as "Icy body", and three
grades of Rocky bodies: "Light", "Medium" and "Heavy". I\'m pretty sure
it doesn\'t matter to the average player whether or not the core is
currently molten. Actually I\'ll take that back - molten cores and so
forth would probably affect the existence of magnetic fields,
radiation belts, volcanic action (expert opinions welcome :-), so it
probably would affect things. In fact I suppose a "molten core" icy
body could be an icy body with liquid underneath a crust of ice (I
think Europa is thought to be like this?). Nevertheless gravity and
atmosphere are far more fundamental...

One thing I\'m unsure about is where a moon like Io fits into the
scheme of things: it\'s certainly not icy, does it have a rocky core?
what\'s it\'s density? Should the "icy body" category contain strange
bodies like Io?

OK, so now we can work out the approximate atmospheric pressure:
assume that icy bodies have a density of 1/3 of that of earth (an
over-estimate?), light rocky bodies have a density of 2/3, medium
rocky bodies have a density of 1  and heavy rocky bodies have a
density of 4/3. Then the formula is:

density*size/8

(which incidentally is also the surface gravity). In terms of the
original traveller atmosphere densities (vacuum: 0 atm, trace: 0 -
0.09 atm, v. thin: 0.10 - 0.42, thin: 0.43 - 0.70, std 0.71 - 1.49,
dense: 1.50 - 2.49) we have:

                                size
            0/S 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A
d   "icy"   vac tr  tr  vt  vt  vt  vt  vt  vt  vt  th
e   light   vac tr  vt  vt  vt  th  th  th  th  st  st
n   medium  vac vt  vt  vt  th  th  st  st  st  st  st
s   heavy   vac vt  vt  th  th  st  st  st  st  de  de

Consequences:
Much fewer worlds with _no_ atmosphere, much more with very thin
atmospheres, fewer worlds with dense atmospheres, and probably fewer
with standard atmospheres. It also gets rid of my original gripe about
small worlds with normal atmospheres.

Problem:
I notice that the Moon (size 2, density light) and mercury (size 3,
density medium) should have very thin atmosphere (Moon: atm pressure
approx 0.16). This seems too high (according to the rules you could
breathe on the moon with the aid of a compressor)... I suspect it is a
problem with the pressure = gravity approximation.

Perhaps larger world sizes should be allowed?

Solution:
Modifiers: If the world is in the inner or habital zones and has a
size of 0,S,1,2,3, then decrease the atm type by one (eg. th -> vt ->
tr -> vac), which solves the problem of Mercury and the Moon.

Any other suggestions, folks?

Right, so then there\'s only atmospheric composition left, and that can
be summarised into the following categories:
OK to breathe:Standard 02/N2 type mix
Bad news to breathe:Tainted 02/N2 type mix
Really bad news to breathe:Exotic
Wear your protective gear:Irritant, Corrosive, Insidious

Finally there are the weird ones: D (dense, high), E (ellipsoid), F
(thin, low). These are really atmospheric pressure considerations, (in
fact ellipsoid is really a planetary _shape_ consideration). So there
are 2 choices here:

If you want good compatability with the previous traveller system,
then consider the following:

Composition  Density  Atmosphere
     0       Icy      Exotic, Irritant or Corrosive
     1       Icy      Standard
     2       Icy      Tainted
     3       Light    Exotic, Irritant or Corrosive
     4       Light    Tainted
     5       Light    Standard
     6       Medium   Standard
     7       Medium   Tainted
     8       Heavy    Standard
     9       Heavy    Tainted
     A       Medium   Exotic, Irritant or Corrosive
     B       Heavy    Exotic, Irritant or Corrosive
     C       Heavy    Insidious
     D       Heavy    Dense, High
     E       Medium   Ellipsoid*
     F       Light    Thin, Low

* or maybe Insidious if you don\'t mind incompatibility.

If you need to know whether a given atmosphere is exotic, irritant or
corrosive, then roll 1D: 1-3 Exotic, 4 Irritant, 5-6 Corrosive.

The only real difference here is that 3 goes from very thin to
exotic/corrosive, so concievably a large world could be having its
effective atmosphere type changed from 3 to A or B under the old
system, however the atmosphere density will only change from 3 to 4 or
5.

All in all, I think it should work OK.

Now for the virus story:

Yes, but you seem to have missed the point: is such a substitute going
to be accessible to a TL7 or 8 world? Indeed I think I mentioned that
I would be surprised if your average TL15 ship\'s computer used silicon
chips. The point still remains: unless the virus is not much of a
threat, there is not going to be any easy way for a world to develop
to TL9 and get interstellar travel (or if they do, it won\'t be long
before the virus finds them and eats all their electronics).

True, you have a valid point here.

Then again, there is probably no way that Deneb could even contemplate
conquest of the Aslan Heirate (especially if they have had major
problems with virus incursions), just like they could not contemplate
annexing the Zhodani. In addition, the Domain seems to be
non-expansionist. I can see that a hard-pressed Deneb might reach some
sort of agreement with the Aslan (after all, the Domain is really only
fighting the ihatei, not the Heirate itself).

Admittedly, in the long run the Heirate is defenseless against Deneb,
but I s\'pose that once it is known that stutterwarp is possible, the
Aslan & Zhodani may well develop it fairly rapidly.

- -or-

Maybe the Hivers help out the Aslan.

Or sell the stutterwarp to them after Deneb has defeated the virus...

Any other suggestions?

It\'s late. I\'d better stop this. 8-)

Stutterwarp, if introduced into Traveller:  The New Era, would eliminate
piracy.  Obviously, if the 100 diameter limit is kept in the game, this is
true.  A ship can travel to 100 dimeters of even the largest primary star
in a few minutes using a Stutterwarp drive.  This will hinder piracy, as
the response time of any system patrol craft will be so fast as to leave too
little time for plunder.  My solution:  away with the 100 diameter limit.

The 100 diameter rule is an aspect of TravPhysics only, a creation for game
purposes, to make the travel time to jump point about 3 days for the most
common (1G) craft.  The TravPhysics argument is that only at this range is
gravity weak enough to allow a safe jump.  But, why 100 diameters, as opposed
to say 1000 diameters, or 10,000 diameters?  In Traveller/MT, it takes far too
long to travel this far on even 6G.  But in TNE, even an emasculated Stutterwarp
can travel to 1000 diameters in less than three days.  I suggest that the
diameter limit be explicitly set so that a ship equipped with the most common
type of Stutterwarp drive takes about three days to travel that distance.

This would allow us to have our Stutterwarp and Piracy too.  So, maybe the
diameter limit has increased by a couple of orders of magnitude.  Like it
really matters.  This can even be worked into the MT/2300AD background, like
so:

There was an article in the Journal of the Traveller\'s Aid Society several
years ago, in which Marc Miller suggested that nothing was known about Jump
Drive physics in our era because a society could not begin to do the proper
research until it had set up permanent bases beyond 100 diameters from its
primary star.  In the case of the Terrans, this meant not until they had
developed bases in the Asteroid Belt.

In Traveller:  The New Era, this becomes:  Nothing was known about Jump
Drive physics in our era because a society could not begin to do the proper
research until it had set up permanent bases beyond N diameters from its
primary star.  In the case of the Terrans, this meant not until they had
developed deep space bases beyond the orbit of Pluto.  (I assume hear that
N will be quite large, placing any ships attempting to jump in deep space).

The best thing about this retcon, is that it leaves things largely unchanged.
Travel time from port to jump-point will be unchanged.  Travel time from
port to gas-giant will be much shorter, but travel time from gas-giant to
jump-point should be approximately the same, perhaps a bit longer.  Travel
between planets in a system will be much shorter, but the most common form
of travel in Classic Trav is interplanetary, the time for which should
remain unchanged.

And finally, it will make piracy a realistic option.  Pirates will be able
to lurk in deep space, waiting for the unsuspecting merchant ship, and then
pow!

The simplest solution is just to raise your hand, and decree that
stutterwarp has always been the way things work.  But it wouldn\'t be the
Imperium we\'ve been playing in all these years if you did.  Anymore than
changing the jump limit to 1000-diameters would be.

And stutterwarp already won\'t function within some specific distance
(the point where local gravity is greater than 0.1G).

Consider also that if you switch to 1000-diameters, then all I have to
do is NOT USE SW.  If I accelerate through normal space, then I\'m
probably moving a couple thousand Km/s relative to a SW-driven pirate,
so after he disables me, he has to spend a couple of days matching
course before he can loot me.  By then, I\'ve made repairs and pushed the
jump button.

Where did you get the impression it takes 3 days to reach the jump limit
in Trav?  At 1G in our solar system, it can be done in less than 4.5
hours.  If you push the limit to 1000-diameters, then a 6G ship can do
it in 2.5 days.  A 1G ship could make 1000-diameters in a little over 6
days.


>This would allow us to have our Stutterwarp and Piracy too.  So, maybe

No.  Then you\'d have to change sensor ranges so you can detect those
ships at long enough ranges that you can find them.  Then change weapon
ranges so you can get a few hits on them.  Then when you realize that
the navy has the same stuff, change them all again so the Navy can\'t
detect the pirates, but the pirates can detect the merchants.

And if you are making random changes to Trav physics, why not just
switch to SW completely, discarding the last ten years worth of work
completely?

Yes, I read the article.  Fascinating.  But wrong.  100-diameters from
Sol is only 139,190,000Km.  Which is closer to the sun than Earth is.
So all you\'d really need is a lab about 1,300,000Km from Earth.

Again, why bother?  If you want to throw out all that has gone before,
you can just wave your hand and say whatever you want.  But is it
Traveller if you do?  The rules are going to be different, so if you
change the background assumptions, you\'re playing a completely different
game.  Possibly a lot of fun, but not Traveller.

Not really.  Have you ever tried to predict the position of a SW ship an
hour in advance?  If not, try it sometime.  Then try to predict the
position of a normal M-drive ship an hour in advance.  Notice the
difference between the two.  Changing the physics so that the timing is
the same WILL NOT leave a virtually identical universe, with a few
buzzwords changed.


>And finally, it will make piracy a realistic option.  Pirates will be
>able to lurk in deep space, waiting for the unsuspecting merchant ship,

See above for comments on changes required to make piracy work in deep
space.  Remember that sensors only detect ships within about 500,000Km.
So when you are travelling through 1,000,000,000Km+ to the jump point, a
pirate has about one chance in 5,000,000 of ever spotting you.  This is
not profitable.  If you change the sensor ranges so the pirates can spot
you, the Navy can spot him.  And SW means that if the Navy is going in
the opposite direction from you, then he immediately turns around and
matches course.  Unlike the old M-drives, where he takes five or six
days to match velocity even if he is only 1000Km away when he starts his
course change.  That alone is enough to do bad things to the picture.

A lot of you may have gotten the impression that I want to keep piracy
in the picture.  I don\'t really care.  In all the Trav I have played,
the only pirates that ever made a difference were cruising around in
Imperial Navy warships, or foreign equivalents.  I\'ve gone YEARS without
even a hint of piracy, and not cared at all.

What I am concerned with is doing damage to the world-picture in Trav.
Once you start changing the technology arbitrarily, you\'ll find yourself
having to predict the side-effects of all your changes before you
release the game.  If not, the game will be as much a disaster as MT
was, and if so, then it will take YEARS of playtesting.  Which I DON\'T
want, because I happen to have a perverse liking for the T2K2 system,
and have been looking forward to a Trav conversion for some time.  I\'m
not looking forward to the possibility that GDW may make vast, arbitrary
changes to hang onto a picture that NEVER fit Traveller (lines of
battle, for instance).  Nor am I looking forward to them changing the
basic world-picture enough that it ISN\'T Traveller.  I can play GURPS
space if I want to play some random SF game.  I WANT to play Traveller.
In the Imperium, or its ruins (Cynthia and I have started to work out
the necessary assumptions to bring the Imperium crashing down in only
thirty or forty more years, game time).  Not something that calls itself
Traveller that has nothing in common with what has gone before but the
name....

If we\'re going to start making corrections for different atmosphere types,
shouldn\'t we also correct for different planet sizes?  I assume that 1G loss
is used up fighting gravity and keeping the vehicle off the ground - except
that it will need more or less than 1G for that purpose, on worlds larger or
smaller than Earth respectively.

Alright, so the virus eats whatever is the common type of chip.  Using
silicon chips is the way to beat the virus, although this does limit the
TL of your computers.  And this, I believe, was the whole point in the

Or in my scenario, the supervirus eats all the deuterium, and everyone

I can just imagine an SF RPG in 1918, where someone proposes an aircraft
that will fly more than twice the speed of sound, stay up using wings,
and have a wing area of 179 square feet.  And someone else says that even
if it didn\'t fall apart from trying to go faster than sound, which is of
course impossible, this aircraft has less than 80% of the wing area of a
Sopwith Camel, yet weighs almost 10 times as much empty as the Camel weighs
fully loaded.  No way will it fly.

40 years later the first person says "Told you!" as a Lockheed F-104 flies
past. :-)

Submitted for your approval: one trade and traffic generator, heavily revised
from the original suggestion posted a couple of weeks ago.  Let me know
what you think.

Starport Traffic and Facilities Generator

These rules generate a pair of numbers which measure the amount of
interstellar traffic in a system, and the quality and extent of the starport
facilities.  2d6 die rolls modified by a number of factors are used to create
the traffic level and the facilities code.

The DMs wewre created based on the assumption that better starports should in
general have more traffic, but not always.  Other factors, in particular the
trade classifications, are quite important.  DMs were created based on the
MegaTraveller trade tables; worlds with more potential Cargo Price Modifiers
will have higher DMs.  In addition, since most traders have low jump
performance, having more nearby worlds to trade with would also help to
increase the trade level.  Implicit in this decision is an assumption about
the range of most merchant ships.  Jump-1 was assumed to be the most common,
and almost all of the rest being Jump-2.  Therefore, the trade effects of
nearby worlds are limited to those within one or two parsecs.  If local
conditions are different, the rules may have to be modified slightly.

Facilities generally follow the traffic volume; however, since significant
imported technology is required at low local technology levels, these
facilities are tyically smaller and less well-equipped.   Worlds with
important military facilities probably have military contractors that are
not adverse to doing work for the civillian sector.  Finally, worlds that are
cut off from interstellar trade by travel zone classification or the wars of
the Rebellion will have smaller and more primitive facilities.


Suggested Use

Use the Traffic or Facilities code just like attributes in task rolls
(divide by 5 and drop fractions).  Finding a shipyard willing and able to
repair battle damage might be Routine(Facilities), while finding  passage on
a ship going to the proper destination might be Difficult(Traffic), if it is
an unpopular destination.  Traders and tramp starships looking for cargo and
passengers should apply the attribute DM (code value / 5, drop fractions) as
a DM to the Passenger, Freight Available Lots, and Cargo Available Lots
Tables.  The codes can also be used to generate tasks; the explanatory
tables (below) show suggested difficulty levels based on the traffic and
facilities codes.


Generation Procedure

Traffic Code: Roll 2d6-2 and apply the following (cumulative) DMs:

  Starport: A=+2, B=+0, C=-1, D=-2, E=-3, X=-4
  Trade Class: Ni=-2, Po=-2, Ba=-1, Fl=-1, Lo=-1, Ic=-1, Na=+0, Va=+0,
               Wa=+1, De=+1, Hi=+2, Ri=+2, As=+3, Ag=+3, In=+4
               Hard Times: Failing or Doomed, +1 (Doom Trade)
  Travel Zone:
    Classic: Green=+0, Amber=-2, Red/Interdicted/Blocaded=-4
    Hard Times: Frontier=+0, Outlands=-1, Wilds=-2
                Worlds in a faction\'s Safe use the Classic DMs
  Trade Partners:
    Per world within Jump-1: If Starport Class A or B: +2
                             If Starport Class C, D, or E: +1
    If no Class A starports (including self) within Jump-2: -2
    If a sector, subsector, local, or polity capital: +1
    If on Xboat or designated trade route: +1
  Polity:
    Classic: Independent worlds: Non-Aligned=-2, Client-State=-1
             Member of an extra-Imperial polity=+0
    Hard Times: Member of a polity: +1 (cumulative with capital DM)
                World is within a faction\'s Safe: +1
  Prosperity: A referee-assigned DM based on local conditions, regional
    trade factors, or campaign storyline needs.  The range from -4 to +4
    is suggested, but the referee should always feel free to modify any
    die roll that is not to his or her liking.

  If the final result is negative, and the world\'s starport class is A,
  B, or C, assign a code of 0; if the starport class is D, E, or X, assign
  a code of X.


Facilities Code: Roll 2d6-6 and apply the following (cumulative) DMs:

  Traffic: apply the full traffic code as a DM (treat X as -2)
  Bases: Depot=+4, WayStation=+3, Naval/Scout=+2, Military=+1
  Local Technology: Pre-Industrial (TL 0-3): -6
                    Industrial (TL 4-5): -4
                    Pre-Stellar (TL 6-8): -2
                    Early Stellar (TL 9-A): -1
                    Average Stellar (TL B-D): +0
                    High Stellar (TL E-G): +1
                    Extreme Stellar (TL H+): +2
  Travel Zone:
    Classic: Green=+0, Amber=-1, Red/Interdicted/Blocaded=-2
    Hard Times: WarZone=+1, IntensiveWar=-2, BlackWar=-3
                Worlds in a faction\'s Safe use the Classic DMs
  Prosperity: A referee-assigned DM based on local conditions, regional
    trade factors, or campaign storyline needs.  The range from -4 to +4
    is suggested, but the referee should always feel free to modify any
    die roll that is not to his or her liking.

  If the final result is negative, and the starport class or traffic code
  is X, assign a facilities code of X.  Otherwise, assign a code of 0.

Designer\'s Notes

The explanation of codes deliberately avoids specific numbers; this is so
that individual referees can use this system regardless of the level of
interstellar trade they want portray.  I have been a part of different
campaigns where the average level of trade varied from a couple of free
traders a week to ten- or hundred- thousand ton bulk transports arriving
every few minutes.

The +1 for "designated trade route" can be applied to Hard Times as well as
to xboat and other trade routes in a stable interstellar state.  It could
even be applied to any well known and well-travelled mains, like the Vilani
Main and the Spinward Main.  It should definitely be applied to trade "runs"
like those described in the Diaspora sector supplement.  However, the
trading partners rule already provides a DM for worlds that are on mains.  If
a world is on a main it gets at least a +2 (one for each neibor world) and
more if either of them have an A or B starport.  Only mains that serve as a
conduit for long distance trade should get the additional "designated trade
route" DM.

A referee assigned prosperity factor was used instead of a random one, so
that the referee could decide where and when to apply it.  If a world with a
depressed local economy is needed, simply (and arbitrarily; it\'s OK to be
arbitrary, the dice certainly are) apply the -4 DM.  Use this DM to paint
entire sectors as a heavily industrialized core, or to pick out individual
subsectors, clusters or even single worlds for deep depression or
spectacular productivity.

For explorations beyond the confines of known space, the referee should
probably look into matters carefully; completely unexplored areas probably
have no trade at all.  The referee may want to compute the trade volume
anyway; this could be the world\'s "potential trade value" or some such.  Any
independent states out there, known or unknown, should probably have a
prosperity level assigned and local trade generated.


Hard Times

Several special modifiers apply to Hard Times.  When generating the traffic
volume, the Hard Times Doom Trade modifier applies in addition to any other
trade classification DMs.  However, the Hard Times Travel Zone and Polity DMs
apply instead of the listed Classic Traveller DMs.  Similarly, when
generating Hard Times facilities codes, use the Hard Times modifiers instead
of the Classic Traveller DMs for Trade Zone.

When generating traffic and facilities for Hard Times, use the final Hard
Times UWP values to generate the final traffic and facilities values.
Re-generating these codes will allow traffic patterns to shift in response
to all of the changes brought on by Hard Times.

For war zone (including intensive war zone and black war zone) subsectors,
Apply the reductions in Stage 1: Destruction of Interstellar Transport.
These reductions are the direct effect of the destruction of starships and
facilities in the battles of the Rebellion.

Outside of the war zones, the reduction of traffic and facilities comes
later, as these areas are cut off from trade and are abandoned by the
factions. The traffic level is reduced in Stage 2: Collapse of Financial
Markets.  Optionally (and this is completely unofficial), delay the reduction
of the starport type for non-war-zone worlds until this step as well.
Reduce the facilities code in Stage 3: Recession of Planetary Economies, at
the same time as the UWP tech level is reduced.


Interpretation Examples

C-5A = Class C starport: Average facility, capable of reasonable repairs.
       Traffic level 5: Low traffic volume.  Facilities Code A: Above
       average.  Although the port gets less traffic than most worlds in the
       Imperium, its facilities are quite extensive.  Local yards and skilled
       technicians can perform almost any work expected of a Class C port,
       with unhurried skill that matches the spacious and uncrowded starport.

A-EF = Class A starport: Shipyard capable of constructing starships. Traffic
       level E: Very High traffic volume.  Facilities code F: Outstanding.
       Although one of the busiest starports in the subsector, this world\'s
       volume of traffic is exceeded only by its efficient and complete
       starport facilities.

B-30 = Class B starport: shipyard capable of constructing non-starships and
       most repairs.  Traffic level 3: Low traffic volume.  Facilities code
       0: Inadequate.  Not much traffic passes through here, and part of the
       reason is the port facilities.  Although it bills itself as a class
       B starport, the shipyard looks deserted, many of the docking bays
       have collapsed, and what few skilled workers are left are crippled
       by lack of tools, parts, and snowed under with a backlog of work.

E-10 = Class E starport: frontier-quality installation.  Traffic level 1:
       Low traffic volume.  Facilities code 0: Inadequate.  Although it
       seems hard to believe, here is an example of a substandard Class E
       port.  It\'s a bomb crater, with a portable landing beacon installed.
       The beacon was courtesy of the last trader through here, about 5
       weeks ago, sold in exchange for a home-cooked dinner.

Expanded Format Used in our playtest maps:

I generated the above sample subsectors by hand; partly this was to prove that
the procedure is not too compilcated to implement with only a pencil, paper,
and dice.  After the first time through (I generated Regina twice; once before
I revised the system, and once after) I came up with the following mapping
system.  I enlarged a subsector grid on a xerox machine until the hex grid
filled the page with just enough space left over for 3-ring binder holes. This
made the hexes big enough to code all sorts of interesting information. I used
the following format to code almost anything of interest directly on the map.
The world type (water, desert, asteroid belt) is omitted from the subsector
grid because it can be determined from the trade classifications.   If I was
going to use the map for a campaign, I would also use a green highlighter to
mark Xboat routes, a blue one to mark polity boundries (I highlighted the
hexlines of the porders), and (of course) pink and yellow ones to mark Red and
Amber zones.

Opposite each page, I put a sheet of graph paper (college-ruled notebook
paper would work just as well).  On this sheet I put the world data in the
usual format (I put the trade and facilities right after the "extended"
population, asteroid belt, and gas giant data; ie: 123-45).

Actually, no, the asteroid belt is the likely cantidate for that.
The 1.3 million km. excludes both the Moon and the terrestrial Lagrange
points.  Any Mars bases we make are within _it\'s_ 100 diameter limit.
The only place likely in the solar system clear of major 100 diameter
zones is the asteroid belt.  We aren\'t likely to build permanent bases
anywhere else.  There\'s nothing out in random deep space to make
putting bases there likely 8-)

40 years from bi-planes to supersonic jets.

Wow, mind bogling advance.

Sort of makes you wonder what we\'ve been up to since.

Makes me wonder why it takes the IMPERIUM over 500 years per tech level

Thanks for the 40 years info.  Makes me feel insignificant in the

George, I didn\'t say that we would build a base there.  I said we
COULD.  Going out to the asteroids is all very nice, but it is also all
very UNNECESSARY in order to develop jump.  Especially since we would
get a good look at the oddities of flat space during those eight month
voyages to Mars in Hohmann transfer orbits.  And almost that entire orbit
is outside the 100-diameter limit of everything (except possibly the
Galaxy as a whole).


Wildstar:

<starport/traffic generator>

I liked your generator.  I didn\'t agree with the modifier for worlds
within J-1 of wherever, since I disagree with the notion of J-1 traffic
being significant (how many one-cycle steam engines are still in use in
the US Merchant Fleet?  They\'re a 150 year old idea, and J-1 is ten
thousand years old.  And was superseded much more than 3500 years ago.)

However, this is a minor quibble.  A slightly (only slightly) more
serious quibble is the extra information you are adding into the
standard hex display - those hexes are crowded enough as it is.  They
really don\'t need anything else stuffed in there.  The extra information
either needs to be relegated to the world listings, or a different way
of listing the information needs to be developed, so that required
information is not buried under a cloud of teensy little
base/starport/GG/whatever symbols in each hex....

I have.  Very good stuff; clearly right up there in the classics of
Science Fiction with Doc Smith\'s Lensman, Heinlien\'s Future Histories,
Asimov\'s Foundation Trilogy, and Clarke\'s early fiction.

As far as establishing communications relay stations at the Lagrange
points go, probably pretty unlikely.  But stations might be put there
for other reasons.  Anybody want to do some *EXTREMELY* long baseline
interferometry?  How does a baseline from Mars\'s L4 to L5 sound?

Thank you!  As far as the modifiers go, I have one suggestion:

Well change it!  Instead of J-1, use whatever the jump number of the
most common trading vessels in your game is.  Instead of +2 per Class A
or B port, and +1 per Class C, D, or E port, use whatever will give you
an expected value of 4.442 in a standard (50%) density subsector.
The same goes for the -2 if no Class A port within jump-2.  Use whatever
the jump number of your universe\'s "long range" traders is.  The
expected value should be -0.4082 in a standard density subsector.  Or
simply remove both modifiers and change the die roll from 2d6-2 to
2d6+2.

I assumed that most merchant starships would use as small a jump number
as possible.  Larger jump drives are considerably more expensive,
require a larger crew, and additional fuel requirements.  All of these
typically come at the expense of cargo space.  The result is higher
expenses and lower revenues, a situation which most merchants detest.

Finally, checking all worlds within jump-1 or jump-2 is a practical
thing to do by hand, on a hand-written map.  Checking all worlds within
jump-6 (for each and every world in the subsector) is a daunting task.
In a case like this, I would simply ditch the modifiers and change the
die roll as indicated.

Go for it!  (and let me know how it turns out)  Kinda reminds me of my
college wargaming society\'s motto: "We can fix these rules!"

By no means am I suggesting that the "expanded" hex display is needed to
run the traffic and facilities system.  The two extra digits go into the
standard world listings, over on the right side, after the population
multiplier, gas giants, and asteroid belts.

I presented my example subsectors in map format because I think that
this makes the traffic patters more clear; I didn\'t intend to suggest
that it replace the standard subsector map format.  The map is also a
good deal more exciting that a listing for 40 or so two digit numbers.

The "expanded" subsector display presented at the end of the article is
simply something I found useful while generating the traffic and
facilities codes, and during subsequent use of the trade and commerce
system.  In both cases, all of the information you need is listed on the
map, so thatI didn\'t have to refer to the subsector data listings; this
makes it easier to work with when all you have is a pencil, paper,
and dice.  I have naturally small handwriting, and I enlarged the hexes
so that everything could fit and still be ledgible (no harder to read
than my other notes, anyway).

Anything that said "playtest" in it was simply the way I did things, not
a part of the traffic and facilites generator itself.

But there is a major difference: one-cycle steam engines are not economical
to build or run these days.  Ships powered by steam would be much more costly
to run and would probably be slower travelling too (correct me on that bit
if necessary).  A starship with J-1 takes the same time as a J-6 ship to
make that short jump and it burns less fuel and it costs less to build and
maintain.  Sure, over longer distances J-1 isn\'t as economical but so long
as a world has trading partners close enough J-1 would be the way to go.

Also, the jump-1 drive of 3500 years ago is exactly the same as the jump-1
drive of the present imperium.  They have made no real progress in all that
time (actually, they can build jump drives that go further but the basic
jump-1 drive is still the same size/cost/everything else as it was originally).

I agree with this completely.  Save our hexes from massive over crowding.
One possible way to improve the situation may be to colour code the symbols
giving some of them dual meaning (not that I\'ve even started thinking about how
to double things up ;-).  Then again, this may still lead to information
overload and it wouldn\'t be as nice to photocopy and distribute.

I\'ve never accepted Megatraveller\'s removal of the jump governor. In
fact, I decided that a higher jump engine was more effective, so that
a jump-2 engine making a jump-1 would only use 7.5% fuel (half of
what it uses for a jump-2).

>All of these
>typically come at the expense of cargo space.  The result is higher

The thing is that there is two types of merchant shipping: Regular and
tramp. Regular merchant ships would be tailored to fit the route it\'s
on. But most player\'s are interested in tramp freight. That ought to be
_less_ for well-established trade runs. As for jump-1 engines, there
are far too many unprofitable star systems even in a Main for a tramp
freighter to waste time with it. With a jump-2 engine he may have less
cargo space, but he saves a lot in being able to bypass unprofitable
worlds (not to mention other kind of troublespots).

I haven\'t had time to look your tables over in detail, but I will do so
and get back to you later. Keep up the good work!

    'topic' => 'weight and balance?',
    'body' => '
  I was chatting with my father the other day, and we started
  discussing his favorite hobby - flying (he has a private pilot
  license).  One of the things we were discussing was the necessity
  and principles of weight and balance calculations.  The past couple
  of nights, I\'ve been thinking about that, and realized (for no
  particular reason) that this concept seems to be absent from
  Traveller/Megatraveller.  I\'d like some ideas on how to add it. My
  reasoning is as follows:

  Obviously, an aircraft, it\'s important.  You have a limited amount
  of power, and you must maintain a certain airspeed to stay up in the
  sky.  So, your weight must be below a certain limit, which, if you
  go above that limit, will cause the aircraft to be unable to achieve
  the necessary airspeed.  Balancing the load to keep the center of
  gravity at or below a certain point (center of gravity of the empty
  aircraft) ensures that you have the maneuverability required to
  provide full control over the aircraft (an improperly balanced load
  could make the plane tilt or flip).

  Similarly for a sea vessel:  If the load is centered too far above,
  ahead of, or behind the CG of the empty vessel, you could end up
  with one sunken wreck.  Too much weight, and you could find your
  decks awash when that big wave comes along.  That water will have to
  be bailed out really fast, because it\'s adding to your weight,
  compounding the problem.  Note that balance problems can be
  compensated for, to some degree, by taking on or dumping ballast
  (which is usually water) into the appropriate ballast tanks (of
  which there are several on your average cargo ship).

  Now, what about your spacegoing vessel?  Well, there are basically
  two cases to worry about here - 1) the vessel can not or does not
  enter atmosphere, or 2) the vessel can and does.

  In case 1), the issue of weight and balance would appear to be a
  non-issue.  The weight is in zero-gee, hence not a factor, and the
  center of gravity would be irrelevant, since there\'s no "preferred"
  attitude in space.  End of problem.  Or is it?  Well, not as
  _weight_, but as _mass_.  Mass possesses a quality called _inertia_.
  Inertia is why you can\'t get that big railroad car moving when you
  push on it with one finger, even though the brakes are off, the
  journals are properly lubricated, and you are on perfectly level
  track.  The formula (for you non-physicists out there) that
  describes this problem is F=ma (Force equals mass times
  acceleration).  Your one finger _F_ is pretty damn small, and the
  railroad car\'s _m_ is pretty large, which means that the _a_, for
  all practical purposes, is not distinguishable from zero.  An
  extreme example, but relevant:  Your maneuver drives, even though
  they violate Newton\'s second law, must be imparting an acceleration
  to the mass of your ship and everything aboard.  They are therefore
  applying a force.  Now, there is only a certain maximum level of
  force that they can provide.  How do you ensure that this level of
  force is going to be sufficient to move your ship?  If I don\'t have
  to worry about this, then obviously my drives can produce enough
  force to move my ship at its rated acceleration even if my cargo
  holds are packed to maximum capacity with pure osmium (the densest
  element known), or maybe the metal that is used for superdense
  armor, or maybe collapsium, or whatever the universe\'s densest
  material is.  O.K., I can accept that.  The logical implication is
  that when I am running with empty holds, or with holds filled or
  partially filled with materials less dense than those cited above, I
  have some extra acceleration available - since the drive can put
  out a maximum force _F_, and the mass of the ship _m_ has gone down,
  so _a_, the resultant acceleration, must go up.  Hmm, does that
  mean that my free trader rated at 1G acceleration can actually get
  1.5G or maybe 2G if I\'m running empty?

  Now, case 2).  All of the comments above apply, once we get out of
  atmosphere.  In addition, we have the "conventional" issues to deal
  with, since when we are in atmosphere, we are far enough into a
  gravity well that there _is_ a preferred attitude for the ship to
  assume.  Which means that conventional weight and balance
  calculations must come into play.  I note that for all ships that I
  have seen deck plans for, if the ship was streamlined (or airframe),
  the internal arrangement appeared to be "acceptable" for "normal"
  weight and balance considerations.  Which would seem to me to be
  common sense, but still...

  Comments, anyone?

J-2 for a 200T ship costs only MCr4.8 more than J-1.  About 7.5%
increase in cost, with the benefit of making (on average) three times as
many worlds accessible with one jump.  Unless you are on a fixed route
(in which case your ship would have the J-drive required by the route,
neither more nor less), a J-2 will (probably) pay for itself just from
the extra flexibility it gives all those footloose free-trader types out
there.

I don\'t believe in J-6 merchants, though Hans recently gave me an idea
that might make me start to believe.

Too true.  But a ship with J-1 has real problems going across two
parsecs of empty space.  A ship on a set route will have whatever drives
are required, be they J-1 or J-4.  On an unscheduled trip (like most PC
types make), a higher J-drive number is almost always worth the cost -
especially if you carry most of the fuel in drop tanks, so your cargo
capacity doesn\'t suffer.

This is true.  This makes very little sense, but that IS the way the
rules are written.  This is not really relevant to my point, which was
that J-1 is too low to use as a favourable mod, since heavy traffic
systems will trade with anyone within J-4 probably.  J-1 is too
restrictive an assumption for defining areas of heavy traffic.

I agree that center of mass is a critical design consideration in

F=ma is important, yes, and the design rules for *anti-grav* vehicles
take it into account, by guaranteeing that one has no more thrust than
one pays for.  The design evaluation step in MegaTraveller (and
presumably Striker, though, cheapskate that I am, I never got around
to buying it before the change-over) explicitly uses F=ma to determine
the maximum possible acceleration of a craft with a given
thrust-to-mass ratio, then applies black magic to convert the maximum
acceleration into a maximum safe speed in atmosphere.

However, as soon as we change over to "thrusters" as a means of
propulsion, we wave hands and make F=ma go away.  Instead, we
calculate the acceleration of a ship based on its thrust-to-*volume*
ratio.  This has never seemed entirely satisfactory to me--what it is,
is an attempt to make all those _High Guard_ ship designs vaguely
salvageable in MegaTraveller--and I\'ve tried several times to juggle
the rules to make mass more important than volume in determining
thruster acceleration.  Unfortunately, doing so *demands* that ship
designers sit down with a spreadsheet (or a custom set of software for
their programmable calculator) and iterate, iterate, iterate until
they get a workable design.  If your players never want to design
their own ships (or you never give them the money to do so :-), and if
you have a computer and a lot of time to spare, this is all fine and
dandy, but as a general mechanic for the non-computer-oriented gaming
public, it just doesn\'t work.  IMHO.  (Whoops, that should probably be
at the top, shouldn\'t it....)

However, none of this is strictly relevant to center-of-mass.
Center-of-mass (or center-of-inertia, or kurtosis point, depending on
what power you raise the moment arm to) only comes into play when you
dig out the ol\' 1 cm grid and start doing the deckplans.  Although
there\'s no intrinsically preferred attitude in vacuum, the Traveller
"thruster" drives have a preferred axis of thrust.  If this preferred
axis of thrust *doesn\'t* pass through the center of mass, you\'ll find
yourself spinning rather rapidly, since torque equals the
cross-product of radial displacement and force.  Or else you sacrifice
maneuver power by biasing the plates to thrust a bit off-axis.

Since Traveller has never had much more than a vague set of guidelines
for doing deckplans, there are no rules for dealing with
center-of-mass.  I take it into account in a vague sort of way in my
own deckplans (which are few and far between, since I\'m an absolute
perfectionist), and then make players sweat about it when they load
and unload cargo.  It\'s nice to see the supercargo of a free trader
ordering the sweating, cursing, exhausted command crew to "push that
container just a liiiittle more to port...a liiiittle more...wait stop
that\'s too far" as he frantically fingers controls on his hand
computer.  It\'s *really* nice when a blown die roll by the supercargo
can mean a lost battle a few days later.  Makes his player feel wanted.

Yes it\'s missing as, I suspect, it\'s too complicated and difficult
to calculate accurately in a gaming situation and the vast majority
of gamers arn\'t interested in that level of detail.

The problem is that weight and balance calculations are different for
every aircraft type, and often for individual aircraft of the same
type if they\'ve had modifications.  This would become very unweildy in
a game (such as one I\'m currently playing in) where aircraft are a
major part of the equipment of the characters.

> I\'d like some ideas on how to add it. My reasoning is as follows:

You can do it either of two ways.
1) Make the players calculate it out, or

2) Create a preflight "check" roll against the pilot\'s (and in fact,
all pilots in the aircraft) skill level.  Make it a normal task.

Also, for those situations where the pilot doesn\'t load the aircraft
make the "loadmaster" do the roll against their skill (work out which one
applies).  It should be an normal task for one with experience.  Give the
pilot (or pilots) a chance to detect problems on their "preflight check"
roll.  This would encampass more than just weight and balance though.
Is the cargo properly secured?  Did the ground handlers forget to put the
fuel cap back on?  Are the tyres/wings/control surfaces/air intakes/
instrumentation probes and holes in good condition, not blocked etc.
NOTE most of these a non-pilot just wouldn\'t think of.

Consequences.
Out of balance:  The aircraft will either want to turn towards the
heavier side, or raise/lower the nose.  It will require some control
input to override this however it may be masked by the trim controls.
Often, in light aircraft the weight and balance shifts as fuel burns off
so the problem may get worse (rarely better though. :-() the longer you
fly.  This problem may not manifest itself until the aircraft is in the
air and climbing to the desired altitude.

Overweight:  Sluggish climb performance.  How badly overweight will
determin how badly it performs.  This problem would tend to get better
as fuel burns off.  An overweight aircraft also won\'t climb as high as
a lightly loaded one.  This probably wouldn\'t be detected until aircraft
rotated off the runway.  As soon as it\'s in the air the pilot will know
something is wrong (but it could be a bad engine!).

The GM can devise other "problems" as needed. :-)

That depends on how you specify the drives work.

I\'ve never been satisfied with Traveller drives (either maneuver or jump)
because of these inconsistancies, however it does make the game a little
easier to play.  Less worrying about practicalities and more emphasis
on situations.

BTW the "Hooded Swan" series by Brian Stableford has a very interesting
universe with a number of maneuver and translight drives with different
characteristics.  Have a look for some ideas. :-)

covered the "real world" aspect of needing to ensure that the thrust is
through the center of mass, so I won\'t go over that again.  As to the question
of how thrusters work--I\'ve always assumed that they _really_ work on
F=ma, and that the drive ratings are simple approximations of what per-
formance would be expected with a typical weight on a given hull size.
However, given that the TL9 antigrav drive unit is the same size and has
the same power input as 650 tons of thrust worth of grav units from the
vehicle part of the deisgn sequence, I always calculate a "true acceleration"
based on 650 tons/drive unit.  I\'ve found that with ships carrying little
or no extra armor, the resulting number is usually within 20% of the "drive
rating" number.  For thrusters I continue to assume 650 tons per unit, with
the extra power required going to account for whatever magic makes them
work in deep space.

In practice, I\'ve never really bothered to recalculate accelerations with
varying cargoes during a game, but it wouldn\'t be prohibitively difficult,
as long as you peg the thrust of a drive unit at some set value.  I have
recalculated acceleration for a ship with a disabled power plant that had
to jury rig some power for the thrusters using a portable fusion plant from
the cargo during a game, but I seem to recall that I just used the default
"loaded weight" for the calculation.

remember who, though I\'m pretty sure wildstar was one of \'em) were
talking about revising the UPP system to have an integrated
"composition" digit that would include atmosphere type and planetary
makeup.

I just looked at an article on Titan (the second-biggest satellite in
the Sol system, bigger than Luna), and it seems that the postulated
relationship between surface gravity and atmospheric pressure is
contradicted by astronomical observation.

Titan has a radius of 2575 km (that\'s a diameter of 5150 km or 3219 miles, for
a size digit of 3), a mass 0f 0.022 Earths, a surface gravity of 0.14 g, and a
surface pressure of approximately 1.5 bars.  That\'s 50% *more* pressure than
Earth, on a *much* lighter planet.  So much for the idea that atmospheric
pressure is directly related to planetary mass or surface gravity....

Titan\'s atmospheric composition is not precisely known, but the
primary gas is nitrogen (pp around 1.3 bars), the secondary is methane
(around 0.15 bars), there might be some argon (pp disputed), and there
are traces of all sorts of nasty nitrogen compounds, from hydrogen
cyanide to cyanoacetylene.  There are almost no oxygen compounds (as
befits a strongly reducing atmosphere like that); carbon monoxide
might have a partial pressure as high as 0.2 millibars.

However, current astronomical speculation on Titan fits the
previously-expressed theory of "everything has a core."  With a
density of 1.88 grams per cubic centimeter (0.34 Earth densities), the
_World Builders\' Handbook_ gives Titan a designation of "icy body."  The best
current estimates give Titan a 1000 km radius core of liquid iron and ferrous
sulfide, surrounded by layers of silicate rock, clathrates, and various ices,
with the exterior being a miniscule crust of water-ammonia ice floating on
(possibly liquid) water-ammonia.

Obviously, the WBH nomenclature of "icy body"/"rocky body"/"molten
core"/"heavy core" needs revision; however, any revision will not be able to
encompass atmospheric pressure as well.

(BTW, I\'ve assigned Titan a tentative atmosphere digit of A: exotic-irritant.
Any comments?)

   I\'ve never liked using thrusters that accelerate a volume instead of mass.
One problem is with relativity: if mass does not affect the acceleration, you
can approach and exceed c without penalty to the acceleration. Also, how does
the maneuver drive define the volume to be accelerated? Can you extend it out
beyond the hull? Why are inertial compensators needed if every part of the
ship is being accellerated equally?

   Using mass-based thrusters does add to the book keeping however; you\'ll
need accelerations defined for empty, average, and full loads. But, in the
interests of keeping things from becoming too complex, I would not worry
about center-of-gravity problems.

Hey Folx,

I was just making some orders to GDW, when, I got switched over to
Loren Wiseman.  So, here\'s some news fer ya\'ll.  I haven\'t seen any
advertizements of ImperialLines, but they\'ve put up a few issues,
I gather they\'ve already sent out issue #3.  They do still have
some back issues for those of you who didn\'t subscribe yet.

Astrogators Guide to Diaspora is also out.

TNE is due out in March, but Loren was guessing at early April.
He\'s not on the design team, so he\'s not really in on it, but
apparantly several disks of info have been filled up for
publishing.

Loren asked me to say that he has an apparantly freaky mail node.
He does recieve all the mail he\'s been sent, but has trouble
getting mail out.  So, if some of you feel he\'s snubbed you, it is
because of a bad mailer.  He doesn\'t get a whole lot of time to
read and respond to mail though.  This and the messed up mailer
will slow his responces to your messages.

We chatted fer a bit, and I will confirm Metlay\'s statement that
it\'s nice to connect a human voice to the writing on the computer.
(Yes, folks, he\'s human, and... Even *I\'m* human. :-)

All in all, a cool guy.

To: skellogg
X-Vmsmail-To: ME

Hey Lads & Lassies,

[Murray Atkinson wrote up some Psionic rules in private
correspondence but the comments I have may be of interest
to the TML.]

One of the ideas he presented (And bandied about on the TML
not long ago) was the idea of taking some of the restrictions
off teleportation and putting on some different ones.

Specifically, The inertia & conservation of energy problems
are solved, allowing someone to teleport with far greater
freedom and even up to interplanetary ranges.  To counteract
this new advantage, he proposed that there is a delay time
between when a teleport starts to form in the new environ
and when they can actually move and act.  (A few seconds
making teleportation similar to the transporter effects of
Star Trek.)

Well, I maintain that this (and the mechanical teleporter
suggeted recently on the TML) are just TOO Powerful as
weapons to be allowed into Traveller.

If someone can teleport across interplanetary ranges,
Ship to ship combat would be useless in the Frontier Wars
with the Zhos.  A Zho teleport commando would be able to
teleport right to the bridge and wipe it out.

Ah!  I hear cries of, \'Not enough firepower!\'  Or \'The
teleporter must have a clear picture of the target!\'
Remember, they *DO* have both.  Teleport commandos usually
operate under a clairvoyant telepathic troop director.
The Clairvoyant scopes out the target, and places the image
of the target into the mind of the teleporting troops.
That way the Teleporting troops save their psi strength
for the journey there and back.  So, if you remove the
inertia problems, you will have teleport commandos
everywhere.  A few seconds is just not enough time to react
to their presence.

\'I teleport into the closet where nobody\'s looking...\'

What about firepower?

Well, The Zho commando\'s standard armament is battledress
and fusion gun.  A fusion gun, if fired in an enclosed
room (like a ship\'s bridge...)  Kaboom.  Every unprotected
person in the room is dead.

Ok, suppose the entire bridge crew wears combat armor?

No Problem!  The average commando carries 20-30Kg of
equipment when they teleport.  Battle Dress is 10-15 Kg
and the FGMP-14 is 10Kg, plus an assorted 5 or so Kg of
stuff... (Grenades...)  Well, combat armor *MIGHT* be
able to stand up to stuff like that, *BUT* I did some
checking in Striker...  At TL 13 (just below Zhodani
common levels) a .1 Kiloton nuclear warhead weighs in
at 10 Kg.  Give up the fusion gun and you got a REAL
NASTY grenade.  Can *YOU* disarm a nuclear warhead
with a fuse of only a few seconds?

(In case you\'re wondering, the nuclear missiles used
in ship combat are .1 Kiloton.)

And if the teleporter only goes in a Vac suit or so,
well a 2 kiloton bomb weighs in at only 20Kg.

Now, if you try to limit the amount that the teleport
can carry (to outlaw large conventional warheads)
Don\'t forget the collapsing rounds! (TL 13).  A 2Kg
collapsing grenade would explode with a force of
1 ton of TNT, and a 4Kg grenade would be worth 10 tons
of TNT.  That\'s an AWFUL lotta bang.

Why is it that the Zho\'s don\'t use these things?  Well,
Teleport range being as limited as it is, it\'s hard to
get out of range of the blast by just teleporting away.
If you can go accross continents, there would be no
inhibitions on doing so.  I also have assumed that the
Zhos don\'t use nuclear warheads against \'Soft\' targets.
The only place nuclear rounds really get used is in
ship to ship combat, or bombarding isolated planetary
defense postions.  (But, don\'t get any idea about
putting that deep site meson gun under a major city...)

Now, if you want to have a mechanical transporter
either akin to Blake\'s Seven, or (Ohmygod) Star Trek
Then nuclear mayhem will similarly be out of control.

Murray also pointed out that the aquisition of psi-skills
is easier for the Zhodani than it is for Imperials.  The
rolls required to pick up talents are less when you compare

   Some of the MT background material would seem to imply that J6 is
   EXTREMELY uncommon, if not reserved to the Imperial government.
   The one thing that strikes me as strong evidence for this view is
   that the gov\'t had to come up with the "stealth courier" which
   looks like a conventional J2 ship (of I forgot which class), but
   which instead has minimal cargo capabilities, with the cargo space
   being used for the increased volume for the Jdrive and the
   additional fuel needed to run it.  If J6 was common, the special
   fleet would _not_ have been the way that Norris, et alia heard
   about the assassination before the general populace in their
   domains; it would have leaked pretty fast to some areas, and once
   the unofficial version of the news gets ahead of the official
   version of the news, it _will_ stay ahead - "News always travels by
   the fastest available route."  Implication: The Imperial
   Government\'s J6 couriers are the fastest available route.
   Secondary implication: Commercial spacecraft with J6 do not exist.

Nope. My cry is: \'My warships have built-in psionic screens and
in my universe psionic screens prevent all psionic phenomena!\'

Personally I would suggest keeping the inertia & conservation
of energy restrictions and make psionics a bit cheaper instead.

I\'ve been toying with making the price of yearly maintenance higher the
older the ship is while making the risks of an inadequately maintained
ships less. The result should be that established corporations would
get rid of their ships after 30 or 40 years because they became too
expensive to maintain. Thus lots of cheap but old ships on the market.

The problem with fleet sizes I still can\'t quite see how to overcome.
More star systems and less high-population planets is what\'s needed here.

Incidentally, the last I heard GDW intended to use the "Light behind the

Just a couple of notes on Mark Urbin\'s questions about the Sword Worlds
in TML-Not! #6:

In the Rebellion Era, the Sword Worlds are still divided into the the two
groups that they were split up into at the end of the Fifth Frontier War.
(Details on request).

If you believe the numbers in the world descriptions, there are only three
really important Sword Worlds--Sacnoth, which has the highest TL--12,
Narsil, whose A population represents the majority of the total population
of the polity, and Gram, in between the two in both tech level and
population.  So, the important question is whether or not Sacnoth would
retain jump capability.

However, as I recall, the question cannot really be answered "authoritatively",
since the Hard Times book deosn\'t show a category for subsectors in the
Spinward MArches outside the Imperium.  Ah well.

I don\'t think the general tone of historical data would support a Sword Worlds-
Darrian alliance, since they\'ve been at odds for centuries.  (Think of the
Serbs and Croats here--they\'ve had centuries to make peace with each other,
too, and it hasn\'t stuck, now, has it?)

Right.  Class A or B ports can do yearly maintainance and all types of
repairs.  In Classic Traveller and MegaTraveller, no mention is made of any
TL requirements for these overhauls; they can be done at *ANY* class A or B
port.  According to Trillion Credit Squadron, repairs can be performed at a
Class A or B port (although Jump-Drive repairs take twice as long and cost
twice as much at Class B facilities).  TCS also imposes the limitation that
the facility doing the repair must be at the same (or higher) tech level as
the listed TL (in the High Guard construction tables) for the system.  Only
Class A ports can construct new ships.

One problem I see with the TCS rules is that there are 29 Class A starports
listed at tech levels below 9.  By definition, these ports are able to
construct jump-capable starships; however, TCS rules makes them unable to
repair the jump-drives of any ships that they construct.

Furthermore, the definition of Class C ports indicates that they are capable
of some types of repairs, but not annual maintainance overhauls.  A complete
model should assign some type of capacity to these ports for repairing
damaged starships.

> [comments on the economics of overhauls, maintainance, and repairs]

Huh?  Where did your numbers come from?

From the designs I have available, military starships can cost over 1 MCr per
ton, while commercial ships cost between 0.3 and 0.1 MCr per ton.
Construction time depends on the size of the vessel, with larger ships taking
longer to construct.

Repair is more difficult to estimate.  According to TCS, "normal" battle
damage takes 1 to 4 weeks to fix, and costs 1/4 of the cost of the damaged
system.  In the case of partially damaged systems (for example, factor 3
system damaged by 1 factor), the fraction is also applied to the repair cost
(in this example, the repair cost would be 1/4 of 1/3 of the cost of the
system).  Critical hits require the complete replacement of the system, at
full purchase price; this takes 4 to 8 weeks.  In the examples below, I have
assumed damage that involves the power plant (damaged to inoperability
through normal weapons fire) and the jump drive (destroyed by a critical
hit); and minimum time to replace the systems.

A bulk freighter of 100,000 tons, built at TL-15 with Jump-1 performance
costs 0.1179 MCr per ton, and will take 208 weeks to construct.  The income
from this works out to 566.59 credits per ton-week.  The same ship pays
11.785 MCr for its annual maintainance, which occupies 100,000 tons of
shipyard capacity for two weeks, or 58.92 credits per ton-week.  Repair of
normal damage costs 628.75 MCr, or 1,571,88 credits per ton-week.  Critical
repairs cost 6,000 MCr, or 7,500.00 credits per ton-week.

A 400 ton subsidized merchant (built using my own design, rather than the one
in the Imperial Encyclopedia) built at TL-15 with Jump-1 performance costs
0.2125 MCr per ton, and will take 64 weeks to construct.  This works out to
be 3,320.31 credits per ton-week.  For annual maintainance, this ship will
pay 85,000 Cr for two weeks work, or 106.25 credits per ton-week.  Repairs
cost 2.675 MCr and 24 MCr; or 1,671.88 and 7,500.00 credits per ton-week.

A 400 ton Q-ship (pirate catcher disguised as a subsidized merchant) built at
TL-15 with maneuver-4, jump-4 performance costs 1.1075 MCr per ton, and will
take 64 weeks to complete, for 17,304.69 credits per ton-week.  Its annual
maintainance will cost 443,000 Cr for two weeks work, or 553.75 credits per
ton-week.  Repairs cost 23.9 MCr and 60.0 MCr; or 14,937.50 and 18,750
credits per ton-week.

The following ships are purely Naval vessels (although I assume that it is
possible that the destroyer or escorts could turn up in the Rebellion or Hard
Times as vikings or starmercs.

A 9,500 ton escort costs 9,499 MCr, while a destroyer based on the same hull
costs 14,178 MCr; both would take 160 weeks to construct, for 6,249.34 and
9,327.63 credits per ton-week, respectively.  The maintainance figures are
499.95 and 746.21 credits per ton-week.

A 95,000 ton frigate costs 117,668 MCr, and takes 208 weeks to complete.
This makes its figures 5,954.86 and 619.31 credits per ton-week for
construction and maintainance.

I think that it is reasonable to conclude that merchant ships will cost
between 1,000 and 5,000 credits per ton-week to construct (with smaller ships
costing more, and therefore being more profitable).  Annual maintainance
overhauls are much less profitable, at 50 to 200 credits per ton-week.
Military and starmerc ships of any size are much more profitable than
merchant craft; again smaller ships are more profitable.

Repairs are more profitable than annual maintainance; these profits are of
the same order of magnitude as new construction (repair of critical hits can
be more lucrative than new construction).  This business is much less secure
(depending as it does on essentially random events) than construction or
annual overhauls.

All of these numbers suggest some assumptions about the way shipyards work,
and about the way they make a profit.  I\'m assuming that the cost per
ton-week of capacity is a measure of the shipyards resources, both in terms
of capacity and in terms of the labor, parts, and materials required.  Since
the shipyard is in business to earn a profit, this figure also includes the
yard\'s profit margin.

Small ships (certainly under 5,000 tons, with most of them being under 1,000
tons) is quite profitable.  Enough so that they may be produced on
speculation when the shipyard is otherwise idle.  If the market for such
vessels is strong, this type of speculation can even be more profitable than
performing annual maintainance.

Annual maintainance is the least profitable of all shipyard activities.
However, it is the only one which can be performed by Class B starports, and
presumably almost all of this work is done there.  Annual maintainance at a
Class A port would be unusual, and an indication of unusually high demand for
this service.  At this point, prices would start to go up, as demand
outstripped supply.  These price increases are almost all profit for the
shipyard; as the price goes up, overhauls start to become as profitable as
new construction.

Larger ships are more efficient for the operator.  The 100,000 ton bulk
freighter\'s cargo bay is slightly over 77% of the ship\'s entire volume, while
a comparable 400 ton subsidized merchant can devote slightly over 62% of its
volume to cargo and passengers.  However, these larger ships are less
profitable for the shipyards.

The construction and maintainance of large ships is probably done under long
term or large order contract.  During the Imperium, transport companies with
long term freight contracts or secure routes could easily borrow money to
build such ships.  Outside of the Safes in the post-Rebellion era, the
companies which used to let these kinds of contracts no longer exist, and the
lack of stability prevents their re-creation; very large transports are
therefore unknown.  This, and not the large amounts of repairs, is what
breaks the interstellar economy (in my not-so-humble opinion).

Heavy traffic systems will still be heavy traffic systems even if they are
isolated; there is a certain amount of traffic which travels farther than
most.  The difference works out to about 4 "points" of traffic density.  How
this translates into numbers and tons of ships depends on your interpretation
of the traffic density chart, and how you divide up the traffic.

A workable interpretation would be to take the total "trade partners" DM
(which can range from -2 to +12, and is typically +4) and compare it to the
traffic level.  If the DM is negative, almost all (at least 95%) of the
traffic is "long-distance".  If the DM is larger than the trade level, almost
all (at least 95%) of the trade is "local".  If the DM is positive and less
than the trade leve), the ratio of the "trade partners" DM to the traffic
level shows the ratio between short and long distance trade.  If the DM is
zero, the amount of local trade is small (less than 1 / traffic level), but
greater than if the DM were negative.

For example, Regina has a trade level of 14 (E), and its partners DM is +3.
About 3/14ths, or about 21% of its trade is with local partners, and the
balance of 79% goes farther than the next parsec or two.  Rebellion-Era
Promise with a trade level of 14, and a partners DM of +4 is about the same:
29% of the traffic is local, and 71% is long-distance.  During the Hard
Times, this shifts dramatically, to a new trade level of 7, and a partners DM
of 0.  Nearly all of it\'s trade is "long distance": presumably to that
relatively undamaged agricultural world at the other end of the League of
Promise.  The local trade (probably to the nearby agricultural world) is less
than 1/7th of Promise\'s trade (over 5% but under 14%, pick any reasonable
number).

I\'d like to see this change, one way or another, in TNE.  Either
everything should be calculated based on tons of thrust and tons of mass
(which has the advantage of making sense), or both accelleration and
agility should be computed on volume of the drive field (which has the
advantage of being easy to calculate).

Well there is an intertialess drive in the "literature".
It\'s called the Bergenholm, and it\'s an old and honourable stardrive

history of science fiction behind it.

But it\'s not Traveller.

What a weird bit of synchronicity.  I spoke to Dave Nilsen, apparrently

I have it; it\'s apparrently been out for about a month now.  It is very
nice, and I reccommend it.  The price is right for the amount of data
provided.  I have only a few minor nits to pick.  First of all, I found
the large map to be overly "busy" - trying to code travel zone
(Frontier, Outland, Wilds) as well as everything else was confusing.
Since this information was already represented on the small map, I don\'t
see why it was coded twice.  The text also includes some minor errata
for Hard Times and Assignment: Vigilante (the Outlands/Wilds coding in
the Hard Times map legend is backwards, and some of the world UWPs in
Assignment: Vigilante are wrong).

I forget which one it was in (I bought Assignment: Vigilante and
Diaspora Sector at the same time), but one contained Imperial Lines #1,
while the other contained a multi-page, full-color, slick-paper ad for
(UGH!) Dangerous Journeys.  Save your advertising budget, folks; I\'m not
interested.

I\'ll add that Dave Nilsen is a good guy, too.  It turns out that he is
from around here (Rockville, MD; near Washington, DC) and we chatted
about some things of local interest.

I don\'t think that this is enough of a disadvantage to offset the
greater freedome and range of teleportation.  Although this is a start.
Let me see if I can come up with some logical limitations (I wouldn\'t
mind seeing teleport become more powerful, as long as it didn\'t
unbalance the game).  Such things are not necessicarily too powerful ...

First of all, teleportation (and clairvoyance, and any other psionic
power) should not be able to cross an artifical psionic shield.  I
assumed that it was ordinary practice for the hulls of Imperial warships
(and for the secure areas of important Imperial installations) to have
integral psionic shields.  End of problem.

Number One: make the transporter unable to beam through a nuclear damper
and/or a meson screen.  That makes it much less useful for large-ship
actions.

I used a "Blake\'s Seven" style transporter in one of my early campaigns.
It had this limitation (and also couldn\'t beam through superdense or
bonded superdense materials).  Finally, it had a really significant
power draw (about 4ep, in High Guard terms, which would now be what,
about 1,000Mw) and a relatively short range (low orbit at most) and was
limited in the amount of material it could beam through.

Yes, it did give the players a big advantage.  On the other hand,
because they had the device, they got a lot of the otherwise
"impossible" assignments.  It all comes out in the end.

For many player character groups, this would be too much.  As a referee,
"Star Trek" sized gimmics go with "Star Trek" sized responsibilities.

Here\'s one for all of the psionics experts out there.  What are the
range and conservation of energy effects for a teleport going from one
artifical gravity field to another, or from one artifical gravity field
to a world\'s surface?

Then again, one of the plants that GM will be closing is it\'s Willow Run
facility, which makes automatic transmissions.  Willow Run was
originally constructed by Ford in 1941 to build B-24 bombers for the
USAAF.  At 2.5 million square feet, it was the largest in the world, and
by 1944, it was producing a finished aircraft at the rate of one an
hour.  After the war it was sold to Kaiser-Fraiser to produce
automobiles and C-119 cargo planes; GM bought the facility in 1953.
Some of the original equipment installed by Ford (including heavy
machinery like the overhead cranes) is still in regular use.

Late TL-5 or very early TL-6.

I like this idea; do you have any specific numbers?

Here is a possibility to play with:

Age of ShipOverhaul cost(delta)
 0 to  9 years00.10%-na-
10 to 19 years  00.11%00.01%
20 to 29 years00.13%00.02%
30 to 39 years00.16%00.03%
40 to 49 years00.20%00.04%
50 to 59 years00.25%00.05%
60 to 69 years00.31%00.06%
70 to 79 years00.38%00.07%
80 to 89 years00.46%00.08%
90 to 99 years00.55%00.09%
 . . . well, you get the idea . . .

By the time the ship has turned 40, it\'s maintainance cost has doubled
and the cost will double again in less than 30 years.

Probably the only real fix for this is to change the formula for
shipyard capacity and tax revenues; change from a linear system to a
non-linear one, so that high population worlds pay and produce less per
person than less populous worlds.

Presumably, if the "light behind the claw" scenario is being used, then
things should be approximately the same as the pre-Rebellion Spinward
Marches.  The Darrians and the Sword Worlds balance each other in a sort
of microcosm of the Deneb/Zhodani balance.

Which means MCr4/year return on a MCr7 investment, or about a 56%
return on investment - Silicon Valley should do so well!

Which means in 18 months you have enough profit to make a down payment
on a 2nd ship.  Another 18 months, 2 more ships.  In 6 years you have
16 ships; by the time you pay off your original note in 20 years you
have over 8000 ships, and you\'re not competing with Tukera, you ARE
Tukera.

This is the *real* reason there should be no Free Traders - they all
become fabulously wealthy and turn into major lines.  The smart ones,
anyway.

In working on my subsector viewer, and thinking of ways I would
like to extend it, I\'ve run headlong into a brickwall that has always
been there, but that I\'ve successfully dodged in the past.  The problem
is, there is NO standard flat ASCII file format for representing a
sector or subsector of extended systems (stars, all worlds, satellites).
The current standard Sector file format reports only the
traditional main world, stars, # of gas giants, # of belts, and position
in the sector.  With that, one can lay out a nice little
sector/subsector map -- BUT, report no more detail on a system than the
main world UPP and data derived from that.  I would like to be able to
display system/orbit data in a format similar to that shown for system
write-ups in "Flaming Eye" and "Knightfall".
I could make up my own extended file format, but then my program
would have to have even more customized data files than it does now.
And, source data files used by my program would not be usable with all
the other sector file manipulation programs out there, nor could your
programs work with my proprietary format... I dislike proprietary protocols.
Jo\'s Library program is the only one I have seen that deals with
extended systems, and I believe it generates them on the fly and stores
them in a proprietary binary file format.  For my personal use, I shoved
the Domain of Deneb into a Paradox data base and add additional worlds
of significance in a system myself.  BUT, what I am seeking (and
strongly suggesting we create) is a Standard (so all future sector
manipulation programs can use it as long as the programmer adheres to
the published format), ASCII (easy to mail, read, and manipulate), File
format that:
1) Shows all the worlds in a system,
2) preserves the relationships between primaries,
secondaries, planets and satellites,
3) somehow avoids unnecessary detail (we need to know that 5
worlds in the system have the standard S00000-0 rocks for satellites,
without actually entering S00000-0 in our file 5 times..)
4) Will be used by TML and GDW in future publications, posts to
GENIE archives, whatever.  Think "STANDARD".

Loren, can you help us on #4?

Perhaps I can start the ball rolling with a suggestion of my
own.  In my Paradox database, I key worlds by
Sector - Hex - Star# - Orbit [ - Satellite Orbit] - Name
example:
Spinward Marches 1705 1 3 - Efate
Spinward Marches 1610 1 4 55 Regina

Sort by Hex, Star, Orbit & Satellite Orbit and you have a fairly
good, quick listing of a system.  This solution doesn\'t deal with
redundant description of "the same old rock", though.  You could leave
them out, but then the "rock" satellites suddenly don\'t exist when you
need them ("Do fly-bys of every body in this orbit -- Indro couldn\'t
have gotten very far with a crippled M-Drive and no J-Drive!"  or
"Tukera has placed a refueling station on that rock in Orbit 55 -- it\'s
near enough the 100-diameter limit that the time saved by not maneuvering in
and out of the gravity well to the starport more than pays for it...")

This is an idea that keeps coming back to me, too.  Has anyone tried putting
some rules together yet?  It makes good sense, and I really think that some
such rule ought to be part of the core for TNE, especially considering that
their background will be full of wretched flying wrecks, judging from the
way that they have described it so far.  Something like a a doubling of
of maintenance cost each ten years maybe?  With extra age "awarded" to a
ship repaired after extensive battle damage?  (Rather like old Twilight:
2000 in that regard).

Given that transportation is not free, the tendency is going to be for most
good systems to eventually end up as high population worlds.  I always have
a hard time explaining why a world that has been settled for a thousand years
isn\'t full....

To paraphrase Mark Twain, the reports of HIWG(UK)\'s death have been greatly
exaggerated! Although we aren\'t *quite* as active as we once were, we
still have several members interested in making a contribution to the
future of Traveller.

The group is not, and never was "STarport" ---- the STarport
newsletter, although now temporarily shelved, only formed a small part
of our activities. The main part of our creative effort has been
directed towards the fanzine *Signal GK*, set in the Dagudashaag
Sector, a quarterly \'zine with over forty pages of adventuring and
background material each issue. Issue #6 should be out sometime
around February.

In addition, Mike Mikesh of Imperial Lines has asked us if we would be
interested in helping with the development of a New Era "pocket
empire". Though the details have yet to be decided, it would certainly
be possible for UK Travellers to have a significant impact on the
shape of New Era.

UK TMLer\'s out there! Are you interested? Adie Stewart is
co-ordinating the next stage in HIWG(UK)\'s activities, and he can be
contacted at:-

Hello TMLers,

Between Dan Corrin and myself, the TML is up and alive again.  And now,
it is less likely to have problems than before.

I\'d like to thank Guy Garnett (Derek Wildstar) publicly for his efforts
to keep people connected via TML-Not!  His efforts were appreciated.

What had happened, was that in the disk crash and attendant efforts, Dan
didn\'t get my home directory restored and working. Dan\'s oversight isn\'t
any reason to condemn him, as he was under intense employer pressure to
get things working again, and my home directory got lost in the wild hard
disk shuffle.

The TML digester jobs run as userid jamesp at engrg.uwo.ca, so without
the home directory the jobs refused to run. Compounding this is that the
TML digesters were self-rescheduling at jobs, and they had to run
successfully to reschedule themselves. So, the TML digester jobs would
fail to run and never restart.

I discovered all this when I was finally able to telnet over to
engrg.uwo.ca, an arduous task that requires some inconvenience at work
(so I don\'t do it unless I really have to).  Once I had it figured out,
Dan had the problem fixed in the twinkling of an eye.  Thank you Dan!
You saved the TML\'s bacon once again!

The improvement I made is that the TML is run out of a set of crontab
entries. As such, the jobs don\'t need to run successfully to be
rescheduled, so hopefully the TML will need much less maintenance than
it used to (I can hear Mark Cook sighing with relief, after having
manually restarted the TML for me a dozen times or so over the last six
months).

I like this one better than the first suggestion.  Among other things,
it actually makes the increased cost of an older ship meaningful.  It
also ties older ships fairly strongly to their homeports, since by the
time a ship is a century old, it\'ll need maintenance every three
months...

Cynthia and I have been playing with this one for several months now.
We are experimenting with variations on the T2K2 old age/maintenance
rules.

So far, the biggest difficulty is assigning a base amount of maintenance
to a starship:  does the required engineering crew work full time
keeping it operating?  If so, then an older ship would require more
engineering crew, else it might have to be quite beat up before that
occurs.

Right now, we assume that the absolute minimum maintenance can be
performed by the number of engineers computed in the required crew
formulas, without rounding.  So most Free Trader types need less than
half an engineer, and the one engineer they carry can keep the ship
operating even after it gets quite old.  But sooner or later, you\'ll
need extra engineers, or extra time planetside between jumps, or the
ship just doesn\'t go anymore.

So far, this has worked out fairly well, but we really haven\'t used it
long enough to see all the problems...

Likewise.  Even if transportation were free, unless it were also
instantaneous, good systems WILL fill up.  The only solution I\'ve ever
seen is to get away from this umpteen-thousand year old civilization,
and play in places where people (ANY kind of people) are just now
arriving for the first time.

>(Details on request).
   Thanks for the info.  Most of my data is Classic Traveller.  I\'m going
by `Supplement 3:  The Spinward Marches\'.  It shows Sacnoth at TL C, five
other worlds at TL B (including Gram), 14 at TL A and one at TL 9.  Could
you please send the Rebellion data.

  I depends on how far it slides.  The key TL appears to be 9.  That\'s where
you get Jump-1, anti-grav, superconductors and fusion power plants.  It
depends on the TL drop.  I just picked up the Hard Times book during lunch.
I see lots of tables for TL and other world data changes.  I\'ll have to sit
down with this one.
  If Sacnoth drops 4 TLs, the Sword Worlds are screwed.  If the drop on that
planet is less than that...a mini empire can spring up.  Only 9 planets are
not part of a jump-1 main that includes Sacnoth.  There is another jump-1
main that contains Hrunting, Tizon, Colada, Joyeuse and Gram.  If any of
those retain TL 9 or better, no problem either.
  If the Sword World military vessels didn\'t use Imperial transponders, they
should have been free from the virus.  GDW might claim that merchant vessals
that traded with the Imperium used the bloody things.  I\'ll have to go back
and check that Challenge issue that talked about how the virus travelled
through out the Imperium and beyond.   I recall a bit from it stating that
the Imperium required all ships operating in its borders to have the things.

>However, as I recall, the question cannot really be answered "authoritatively",
>since the Hard Times book doesn\'t show a category for subsectors in the
>Spinward MArches outside the Imperium.  Ah well.
   GDW is issuing an entire book to just the background for the New Era.
There is lot of material to be covered.  The Spinward Marches (under Archduke
Norris) have been set up to be a pocket of civilization in the darkness of
the New Era.  They are not going to be bothered by the Zhodani (I did find my
copy of the Rebellion Sourcebook) and the Vilani will probably be busy
reestablishing their empire to cause too much trouble for a fairly strong
Spinward Marches.  They do use Imperial Transponders on their jumpships, so
the virus should strike there as well.  The standard TL level there will
drop, but the Spinware Marches is being set up to recover quickly.
  This assumption is based on material I read in the Rebellion Sourcebook.
Archdukes Norris\' SMART project is my basis for the Spinward Marches climb
back toward `Old Era\' Imperial Tech Levels.

>I don\'t think the general tone of historical data would support a Sword
>Worlds-Darrian alliance, since they\'ve been at odds for centuries.  (Think

   Let me try this picture instead.  Zhodani probably aren\'t going to bother
with the Darrians or the Sword Worlds.  Small empires don\'t bother the Zhodani.
The Sword Worlds can raid in toward the old Imperium and trade their blunder
to the Darrians, who will probably maintain a slightly higher tech level.
  The old Imperium there will have their hands full between: rebuilding; the
Aslan expansion; the Solmani Empire; Sword Worlders ; something else I\'m sure.
  New data from Hard Times show lots of `Wild\' and `Outland\' areas for Sworld
World Vikings to raid.  Some of it may be what Piper called `Chicken Stealing\',
but there are sections are are going to be unknown.


  Skipping over to TW2K rules:  In the `Special Operations\' book, GDW changed
the rules for 3 round burst fire.  A three round burst may be an aimed shot,
using the characters small arms (rifle) skill.  One or two of the three rounds
may hit the target.  All other 3 round bursts fired that action phase are
treated as standard full autofire fire.  i.e. roll a d6 for each shot fired in
the burst and any 6 is a hit.
  This helps a bit, but is still kind of icky from my point of view.  I\' m
still kind of bummed over a character with autoweapons-5 have no better chance
of hitting his target with an autorifle than a new recruit who has just
finished basic training using a standard semi-auto rifle.

""Exterior demountable tanks and drop tanks simultaneously increase fuel

I see...  I would think that drop tanks would not have jump grids.  How would
you play unarmored tanks different then unarmored tanks?

"Assuming your ships will not get into combat just because you don\'t intend
them to is "pretty stupid".  What if your enemy has other plans?!?"

NOTE: right after the start of the TCS game I lost reliable network access, so
I don\'t know how much of my original intentions were carried out by my
successor.

The intent was for the carriers to jump in, deliver the riders, and jump out
again immediately to the roundevous (or have different pickup ships jump in at
the prearranged roundevous point)

"The lack of J-drives ensured that they didn\'t escape."

That was my point.  That they were outnumbered explains thier loss of the
battle.  They were designed to be used in situations where *they* had numerical
superiority.


"Jim, when your 1G riders tried to run, they were followed by 6G fighters and
riders.  When your 1G carriers tried to rendezvous with your riders, those 6G
riders and fighters shot your carriers to pieces, thus putting even more of New
Colchis\' ships in the bag.  Whenever your riders tried to get to a carrier to
jump away, the effect was to put the carrier out of action too."

Poor tactics for the riders to lead overwhelming enemies to the roundevous
point, when they couldn\'t shake them...

All in all, it would have been better if they all had Jump drives.

BTW, can you put me on the TCS \'listeners\' list?  and fill me in on what\'s gone
on?

The figures I\'ve been thinking of is 100 hours for a yearly maintenance
of a new ship. That works out as 12.5 8-hour days which, with one day
of the week off, is very close to the standard two weeks (this also gives
you the option of getting it done faster if you\'re willing to pay for it).
I\'d then increase this by 1 hour per year the ship is old. I\'d also
introduce an \'overhaul\' which takes longer and costs more, but reduces the
effective age of a ship. On the macro level (fleets) I\'d use one extra day
per 8 years of age.

Here\'s my suggestion for this:

Argument: The more people a society consists of, the higher the proportion of
non-contributing members. By contributing members I mean anyone in a primary
or secondary occupation. I don\'t mean to imply that people in tertiary occu-
pations dosen\'t work, but they all live one way or another on whatever wealth
the primary and secondary occupations creates. The amount of money that a
planet can afford [1] to spend on naval forces is therefor modified by a
factor that depends on the size of the population:

    Factor = 1/(2 to the power of (8 - log (population))).

This factor is 1 for a population of 100 million, 1/2 for one of 1 billion
and 1/4 for one of 10 billion. It will be 2 for a population of 10 million
and go on doubling every time the population level goes down by one.
(Obviously there is a limit to this. I ignore any world with a population
less than 100.000. Such will tend to be colonies and outposts and thus go
on the parent planet\'s budget anyway.)

Note that you can provide another explanation for this if you don\'t like
mine. Perhaps people on a low-population world is just willing to use more
money on the military than people on a high-pop world, because they feel
less secure.

In a federation all planets will want the other planets to pay proportionally
the same as themselves, so the budget must be tuned to the ones who can pay
the least per citizen. Fortunately these will constitute a majority, so they
will be able to ensure that. (I ignore the possibility that the majority will
force the minority to pay disproportionally much). So (using TCS figures)
Planet Big, with population 1 billion, can\'t pay more than 250 Cr/citizen.
30% of this goes to the federation, so Planet Big pays 75 Cr/citizen to the
federation fleet. They retain 175 Cr/citizen for their own planetary
defenses. Planet Medium, with population 100 million, can afford to use 500
Cr/citizen, but they still only pay 75 Cr/citizen to the federation. They
retain 425 Cr/citizen for their own planetary defenses. (Incidentally, they
don\'t _need_ to use all the 425 Cr left over on defense. If they\'re near an
unfriendly border they propably will, if they feel secure they may give
their citizens a tax break or use the money for other purposes).

Note that if you multiply the population by 10 you multiply the naval
budget by 5, so a high-pop world will still be considerably stronger
than a low-pop world.


[1] Actually "are willing to spend". This is what the government can get
    their taxpayers to pony up with without them growing resentful. And
    we\'re talking peacetime. In wartime all bets are off. A society will
    willingly spend much more than they can afford in such circumstances,
    witness how WWII more or less ruined Britain even though they won.

The Sword Worlds trading with the Darrians?!?  What a concept!  I would

Why should the Solomani matter to Norris?  They\'re two or three years
travel away.  For that matter, why should the Sword Worlds matter?  He
can swat them like flies whenever he decides to.  I suspect that fear of
Zhodani retaliation is the only thing that has kept him from securing

Just finished basic with a standard semi-auto rifle???  When did we
switch to a semi-auto rifle for basic training?  I thought we were still
using the M-16, and full auto is part of training with the M-16...

They probably don\'t.  But if they sit within a meter of the hull, they
don\'t need jump-grids.  And why would I WANT to play unarmoured tanks
different than unarmoured tanks?  They seem pretty much the same to
me...

Very little, really.  He developed his own doctrine for use, adapting

Well, assuming that you will always have numerical superiority is not
really a safe way to bet.  Especially if the other guy jumps YOU.
Because then he will ensure that HE has numerical superiority before
ever he starts.

TCS Guideline:  You can guarantee local superiority when YOU attack.  If
you can\'t, don\'t attack.  It is impossible to get superior numbers into
a defensive operation, unless your opponent doesn\'t know what he is
doing.

Which is to say, Jim, that your basic operational assumption was always
that you would be on the offensive.  Nothing wrong with the assumption,
assuming you start offending right away, and never let the other guy get
the initiative.  But sitting back till you are attacked will trash that
whole doctrine right away.

Of course it was.  But your "rendezvous point" assumed that your ships
would be able to get there without interference from the enemy.  NEVER

There really isn\'t a TCS "listeners list" as such.  Occasionally, when I
get ambitious, I post an update to the TML.  I will always answer
questions privately (when I have time).  If there is any interest in a
"listener\'s list", let me know, and I\'ll start posting generally
available information to it every turn or two.


And since the last time I posted to the TML, nothing much has happened.
Serendip Belt has had a revolution (the new ruler is a complete loon).
The "Serendipity" (the Belt\'s big battleship) has just invaded Zuflucht,
thus bringing all the worlds of the Islands (except Topas) under the
control of one or another of the major powers.  The Topas
government-in-exile seems to be returning to Topas.  And diverse great
powers are sitting around talking, getting paranoid, and trying to
prepare for the "next war".

And all you people who asked for the unedited copy of Jane\'s should be
getting it this weekend.  Possibly even with commentary added...

Well, when I was in boot camp, we had M-16 A1\'s and they were full auto.
However, you actually only *saw* them fired full auto once, and, if you
were one of the lucky dozen or chosen from an entire company, fired it
full auto yourself.  By the time I went to Infantry Training School, the
M-16 A1\'s had been replaced by M-16 A2\'s, and they do not have a full
auto selection.  It had been changed to a three round burst feature.

When they showed us full auto fire with the M-16 A1, it was an example
of what *not* to do with your weapon.  Full auto fire from anything
other than a tripod or vehicle mounted autoweapon is generally a waste
of ammunition, thus the switch to a burst feature on the M-16 A2.
Of course, that was in the Marine Corps, I don\'t know if the Army does
things the same way.

I have not been in any military service myself, but I can tell you that
until recently, the British Army at least did use semi-auto rifles.  Their
SLR (Self-Loading Rifle) was a version of the Belgian FN-FAL, modified so
that it could not fire full auto.  Why it was so modified, I do not know;
perhaps to save ammo, perhaps to save money on ammo, perhaps to encourage
the soldiers to shoot more accurately, perhaps because letting a soldier
loose with a full auto weapon in a situation such as the streets of Belfast
was decided to be too risky.  The decision has since been reversed, though,
because the newer rifle, the SA-80, can fire full auto.  Mind you, it only
fires those toy 5.56mm bullets, so perhaps it needs to. :-)

(Yeah, I know, they aren\'t really toys, and I wouldn\'t want to be hit by
one! :-)

Happy Christmas (or midwinter [midsummer for some of us] festival of
choice) to you and everyone else on the list, too.

I copied the mailing list because this is a truly interesting question,
with lots of long, emotional, and reasonable, answers.  In a nutshell,
TNE is the product that GDW will introduce (real soon now?) to replace
Traveller and MegaTraveller.  I personally don\'t know if they also plan
to replace 2300 with it (or even if 2300 is still a product).

Might be good, might be bad.  Depends on who you talk to, and what they
liked or didn\'t like about T and MT.

But, it is coming from GDW.  And, while they have been roundly abused in
our forum, they really have produced products of reasonable quality for
many years now, so it shouldn\'t be too bad.

Anyone else have Cr 0.02 they\'d like to throw in?  (please no flames
this time - it\'s just an information inquiry).

When I was in the Cadet force, we were shown a 9MM Sub machine gun on
full auto, to get this special permission had to be given by the
Major. The British forces very rarely use full auto due to the danger
of jams in the Gun. Even the SAS when storming buildings use two
burst of two rounds, no more or the N.C.Os get a bit upset and you
wouldn\'t want that would you, (no I didn\'t think so)

Hi,

Can someone point me to reference materials showing the system charts for
Reaver\'s Deep (Tuvir) such that 1)  I can see what systems are nearby,
2)  where they are in relation to the Solamini Rim, Spinward Marches,
Imperium core etc

I guess I\'m asking to be pointed to an overall map of the Imperium as
it appears in Traveller/MegaTraveller?  (I\'m assuming that the PBEM
game is based in the same universe...?)  These references could
be GDW published stuff, Postscipt files available for FTPing, or Challenge
or other periodical articles...

There\'s been a sudden decrease in posts to the Traveller Mailing
List, and not all of it is due to the hollidays.  Many of the
most prolific posters are off on a new project now, which ha
been alluded to previously; we\'re developing a pocket empire
in the Traveller: The New Era universe.

Since we\'re all scattered around, it\'s being done via email, sort
of like a smaller more intense TML focused on this one area
and topic.  I was origionally planning on relaying what we
were doing back to the TML; one problem that has cropped up
is that there were over 115k of mail on the tne-pocket mailing
list in the first week of operation.  I don\'t like the idea of
dropping all that on the TML at once.

The idea behind tne-pocket was to create a more focused, faster
reaction list for this specific purpose, but not cut the TML
out of seeing what\'s going on on the tne-pocket list.  Towards
that end, three things are or can happen: 1, I\'m archiving all
the tne-pocket list mail at the ftp site ocf.berkeley.edu;
2, individuals who are interested can join the tne-pocket list;
and 3, I\'ll try and post a summary of what\'s been going on
each week to the TML.  Or maybe someone else on the tne-pocket
list can be coher...convinced to do it 8-)

If you have any questions about joining the tne-pocket list
or how to access the archive (if you\'re not used to using
FTP for instance) then just go ahead and contact me by
email at gwh@lurnix.com and I\'ll help.

The first summary should be out before christmas, if I can
get my last bits of shopping in. 8-)

Greetings from Newfoundland...

Well, I\'ve been a passive subscriber to the TML for about
a year now and have found everything said quite fascinating. I may
be beating a dead horse here, but, I recently invaded sunbane and
retrieved the postscript deck plans for the Chrysantemum Class
1000 ton Light Escort and the Louegkhou Class 200 ton Vargr Trader.
Great Deckplans! Unfortunately, I cannot locate the UCP on any either
of these two craft. Are these craft from a GDW release (and probably
not allowed on the archive sites as a result of copyright laws)? Is
there somewhere I could get a look at these plans? Hmmm.
For that matter, are there any other postscript deck plans floating
around the net? I would greatly appretiate it someone could point me in
the right direction.
Also, I remember somebody was doing a listing of alternate personal
weaponry for Trav... Maybe Robert Dean?  I was just wondering if there
were any traveller versions of the 10mm pulse assault rifle used in the
movie "Aliens" around.
Well, thanks ahead of time! Merry Christmas to all!

Well, in the U.S. Military, it was because of ammo considerations.
I believe that they were disturbed by the ratio of rounds expended to
number of kills; it was *way* to high.

>(Yeah, I know, they aren\'t really toys, and I wouldn\'t want to be hit by
>one! :-)

No, you wouldn\'t.  The reason they use those 5.56mm bullets is because
velocity kills, not size.  I\'m not saying that it dosen\'t hurt to get
hit with a .45 caliber at 450fps, but a 5.56mm at about 3000fps is a
lot nastier.  They tend to bounce around inside the body a bit, and
even when they don\'t, hydrostatic shock will probably get you.  I
assume that\'s why a 4mm Gauss Rifle round is deadlier in the game than
your standard autorifle, or ACR.  (And you thought Traveller wasn\'t
going to get into this!) :-)

Ah, I see you got the budget tour :^) ... When I did my duty, every
one of us was "required" to empty a short magazine (20 rds).  And we
were DIVARTY (artillery), of all things.  During M16 qualifications,
I got the Expert Medal (BARELY), so I think I was a pretty crack shot.
*BUT*
When it came time for us to "blow our wad", I\'d be durned if I could hit
anything on full auto.  Even at 50m.  The weapon likes to climb, and you
end up spending more energy keeping it level than targetting.  When we
got to do short-burst (semi-auto) firing, the situation improved, *slightly*.
The biggest problem with any flavor of auto fire, is that it is almost
a complete waste of time on a *still* target.  Some of us got to try
this (short burst firing) out on moving targets, and the success rate
was much better (it was explained to me that a moving target is more likely
to move into the path of any one of a smattering of bullets - in a sense you
are making the surface area of the round much large by throwing out alot of
\'em at once.  It\'s the same principle that makes it easier to hit a fastball
with a tennis racket than a baseball bat - increased "surface" area).

There are a number of other reasons to avoid full auto-fire as well.
If any of you have had the "opportunity" to do that, you may remember
how warm the barrel gets (that\'s why the handguards *wrap* the barrel).
Amoung other things, the hotter the barrel gets, the greater the
likelihood of a weapon jam (in a fire-fight, something like that could
ruin your whole day...).  The short-burst style of firing helps to
avoid that.  I imagine that is one of the biggest reasons for going to
short burst in the M16A2.

The vets in this group (the US vets, anyway) also may remember that
most weapons designed explicitly for auto-fire are issued with TWO barrels.
Any guesses as to why?

On a slightly different note, most of us hated having to do any auto-fire
qualifications, because it really makes a MESS of your weapon (carbon
deposits), and the day ain\'t over till the last one is SPOTLESS...

Jason.

I might add here -- It\'s great seeing the interaction.  We have some
sharp minds at play here.  Keep it up.

Then again, I might not ... 8*]

I was putting together a listing of nonlethal and other weapons for MT before
the ann0ouncement of TNE put a hole in my preparations. These days I have
other fish to fry Travellerwise, and until TNE comes out I leave MT weapons
rules to others. Sorry.

  Yes: The Gaussrifle. Good range, good penetration, good damage, large
magasine capacity and in at least one version (the one illustrated in the
Traveller Digest) it had an integral pump action 3rd RAM grenade launcher under
the barrel.
