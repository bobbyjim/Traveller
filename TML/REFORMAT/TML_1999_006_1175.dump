It\'s not a matter of *efficiency*. It\'s a matter of *limited* available
power. Heating and coooling, even using heat pumps, use *huge* amounts
of power. You can\'t *afford* the extra battery mass required (not with
any battery we are likely to see).

So you use the heat driven accessories.

The standard method (from the older rules) was to roll a die for the
direction (1-6). Then throw a die for the *number* of dice to roll for
distance. Then roll that many dice for distance.

I think there was another die roll for the number of hexes "sideways"
from the line you just determined. 

There\'s a "random hex selection" trick used for something else in
several of the old CT modules (for generating star locations as a ship
explores "unknown" territory) that assigns 2 digit numbers [1-6][1-6]
to a pattern of hexes 6 hexes across. I wonder if something like that
could be done for misjumps, just to make them a bit more random. 

If I design it, I\'ll have to borrow a friend\'s scanner to scan the
resulting diagram. :-)

Huh? Sure you can. Remember you roll 1 die to determine *how many* dice
to roll for distance. So if that die comes up anything but 1, you are
rolling 2 or more dice for distance. Which means that 7 *is* possible.

High Guard didn\'t have rules for commercial ships such a number of
stewards, medics, cargo per passneger etc. I think Low and mid passage
require 100 kg each and High passage require 1 dTon.

        Hello, Eris!
        I could not agree more.  I think one of the best things about the
LBBs was that they were a great framework, but had enough airflow that it
wouldn\'t choke me.  Every TU will be a little bit different, or at least I
hope so...  That\'s part of the point of an RPG, I think.

        Um, Paul....  CT says in the section on starship operations where it
is discussing the different passenger classes what baggage they can take.
That is why the Faerie has such a large cargo hold in the design...  mostly
High passengers....

        Right now, IMTU PBEM, the players *must* conduct a deep-space jump
and refueling...  Two ships crossing a JP2 distance and one ship is only JP1
with minimum tankage...  so, the second ship is having its cargo bay
partitioned to hold enough fuel to function as a tanker for the second.

        I personally don\'t see what the problem is with an "empty-hex jump".
It causes artificial rifts if you make it problematic and will severely
retard exploration....

        BG\'s block *every thing*.  They are a 100% energy sink...  that
energy is shunted into capacitors which need to be bled off...  Note that it
works both ways...  while the BG is on, the Enemy can\'t fire in, but you

Depends on how much money you want to spend. I would suggest, if you can
afford one of them, either Adobe Illustrator or Macromedia Freehand. My
personal preference is the former, although this is mostly due to exposure
to the application (I use it at work). Both are moderately easy-to-use,
vector-based illustration programs.

 Hate to break the news, bud, but the copy of James\' database

 Nary a weapon, crowbar, skill, or skill category listed in

Amen, I was sorely disappointed. It would have been a tremendous asset in my

2) The program no longer has occasional \'Out of Memory\' errors.

3) Text files and Data file produced with the same random seed in Sector
Wide System Generation now have the same data.

4) The program no longer creates an error message when using HTML file
format for Sector Wide System Generation.


5) List boxes for Load UWP and \'Generate World Details for Entire System\' no
longer remain on screen if another function is selected.

The program also introduces a new feature. The user can now select from two
input methods. 1) The standard List Box method; or 2) The new Text Box
method which is much more intuative.

The new program can be downloaded from the following address:-

"High Passage .... There is a baggage allowance of up to 1,000
kilograms.
"Middle Passage ....  Baggage totalling 100 kilograms is allowed.
"Working Passage .... Baggage totalling 1,000 kilograms is allowed.
"Low Passage ....  Low Passage costs Cr1,000 and includes a baggage
allowance of 10 kilograms."

Book 2, Starships, at 4-5 (2d ed.).  Baggage allowances are not in
displacement tons, but in kilograms.  Clothes are less dense than
water.  Most other personal effects (of PCs, anyway) are denser than
water (weapons, commo gear, armor, computers, electronics, etc.).  So
Baroness Hortense de Zivije may need and be entitled to 2 displacement
tons for her various ball gowns, masquerade costumes, formal court
attire, Moot dress, etc., etc., etc.  Her bodyguards, ex-Sgt. Maj.
Lauderdale and ex-Other Curee, may only get less than a displacement ton
each for their gauss rifles, grenade launchers, map boxes, combat armor,
etc.

	Cx designates Mora as the sector capital.  Cs designates subsector

IIRC, a typical 1990\'s auto AC system is 2-3 tons capacity (lets say 2.5
tons or 30,000 BTU).  This takes about 8.8KW to operate. This is about the
same amount of power that a 10-11 horsepower motor would use.  To put this
in the context of an electric (fuel cell) car, how large a drive motor do
they require?  And what is the power production ability of these fuel cells?
Is another 10-11 KW a "make or break" on the design (adding another KW or
two to account for an electric resistance heater - that heat pump is going
to take an AWFULLY long time to heat up a vehicle interioor on a cold
morning!).

How did you get "more than doubles"?  I used my spreadsheet and made up a
regular free trader and a jump-6 drop tank version.  (My numbers didn\'t
come out exactly like those in the books, mine had 71 tons of cargo and
cost 27 mCr).  If I go to a jump-6 ship I get a 96% in increase in cost.
This is ofset by the 18% increase in cargo space and is much less
than the 6 fold increase in speed.
(If you go jump-3, the increased cost is paid for by the cargo increase
and you get the tripling of the speed for "free").

Now these changes seem clearly big enough to justify switching
to a drop tanks system (and I can\'t see any reason why
a drop tank should be expensive and the cost can\'t be spread
over all the ships that jump out of a system).  They also
seem clearly big enough to make the cost of cargo a fraction
of the original price.

Well, I hadn\'t appreciated the "adjustable" nature of the rules
when I playtested them them.  Good for you.  When I look at the
distance table, it looks like a drop tank system will take
the average jump from a 0.5 modifier to a 1.0 modifier.  Does
it make a difference if you push up BTN by 0.5?  It also, if
a ship can do things a lot cheaper, have a linear effect on
the cargo price.

It seems to me that it won\'t, as a first believe, invalidate
the basis for the system, but that a GM will have to make changes
(and that the current system does present a non-drop tank system).
How hard will that be?  If a GM just drops all BTNs by 0.5
will that do it?  How does he handle cargo price.  Does he
go in and just work out how the cost change for a number of
ships and change the cost of cargo proportionately?

I actually do a lot of graphics work with several very economical
packages.  Surprisingly enough, MS Paint handles most of my
needs.  Transparent cut-n-paste, assorted tools, mirrors, skewing,
basic 90 degree rotations.  For deckplans, that usually all you
need.

If you\'re thinking about that Starship Showcase thread, also
check out Persistence of Vision (www.povray.org).  It\'s a free
multi-platform ray tracing package and when coupled with
some modeling software, you have a powerful but inexpensive 3D
graphics solution.  At the above link you can also find URLs
for POV Lab (freeware) and Moray (fully functional shareware).
All the ships in my gallery are made with Moray and POVRay.

> What do people wear in YTU?

High Fashion of Capital/Core - circa 1100

The most important charecteristic of evey outfit is that it be
expensive, and that it is readily apparent that it is expensive.  Aside
from that there are fewer fashion requirements then there are today
because Imperial culture is much larger and more diverse then modern
Earth culture.

Technology increases the possible options in fashion choices, as fabrics
become sturdier oufits from them can be made of thinner cloth, they can
show more skin as smaller bits of cloth are strong enough to avoid
tearing, and more extreme outfits can be seen as "practical" because
they will last.  Therefore since conspicuous consumption sometimes
requires a rich person, especially a noble one, to be wearing an outfit
that 1) clearly cost tens of thousands of credits, and 2) is clearly
impractical enough that it will only be good for one or two wearings
high fashion has had to a bit creative.  One of the assumptions I make
is that as technology advances the price of manufactured goods will go
down but the price of personal services will not (barring the use of
robots, IMTU I assume that delicate tactile sensors, and eyes that can
perceive millions of colors are difficult to develop and that it is
therefore difficult to have a truly accomplished robotic heardresser or
makeup applier).  Therefore an expensive outfit is one that took a great
deal of hired effort.  For example a noble interested in truly
conspicuous consumption might hire a master artist, at a price of Cr
100,000 or more, to paint a costume/painting on their naked or near
naked body, making sure to sign it conspicuously so that their friends
will know they are wearing a Picasso, and that they will wash it off
after the party.

However IMTU trends in high fashion are set by the Empress, and to a
significantly lesser extent the Emperor [IMTU the Emperor, because his
word is law, tends _not_ to comment on/influence fashion matters because
1) they are not worth his time 2) much of the tiem the clothing he wears
is dictated by tradition [que Fiddler on the Roof music] and 3) if the
Emperor says "I [or We] do not like that outfit." its wearer is
commiting lese majesty therefore the Emperor tends not to say "I/We do
not like that outfit."  Despite this it is occasionally rumored that
Emperors Dressers have taken _very_ large bribes in the past to select
new clothing for the Imperial Wardrobe and then ensure that his Imperial
Makesty is seen wearing it.

Official Traveller sources have tended not to say very much, if
anything, about Empress Iolanthe.  I assume that they have not said much
about her because she does not _want_ them to say much about her. 
Therfore IMTU Iolanthe is a shy [-5 points, Mild Shyness in GURPS terms]
woman.  Therefor she tends to be rather conservative in her own fashion
choices so as not to draw attention to them.  This conservatism of hers
has set the tone for Milieu 1100 top fashions and has made them more
conservative then they othewise would have been.  For example outfits
with grav belt type effects built into the fabric causing capes that
levitate behind their owner are _right_out_ and are seen as the sort of
vulgar items that people with more money than class might wear.

A few examples of high fashion outfits a charecter of mine, Sir Sigrid
Ottawa OI, OEG wore follow. [Sigrid was of primarily Solomani descent,
therefore she choose to avoid Vilani influenced styles.  She was dark
skinned and this affected her color choices.] Prices are in kilo (1,000)
credits.

Jeweled knights circlet KCr 250; Green silk outfit KCr 20; Shurshi cloth
dress KCr 30; sexy black dress KCr 20; formal outfit for wearing to a
coronation KCr 50; Color changeing irridescent mirrored computer
controlled outfit [can be set to serve as Reflec-1]  KCr 30; the one
with the cape KCr 10; the business suit for wearing to megacorp board
meetings KCr 40; the fur [for wearing in weather below about 10 C]
30KCr; the fluffy white 1980\'s prom queen style outfit which conveys the
message that she is an airhead who could not possibly be plotting
against you, useful when she was in fact plotting against them KCr 20;
the outfit left undefined for future plot purposes KCr 20.  All these
items were carried in a fashionable TL 15 floating Wardrobe with a Grav
module & a computer telling her what was worn when worth KCr 150.

IMTU entering jumpspace subjects a ship to the physical laws of
jumpspace.  One of the more important difference is that in Jumpspace
the motion of an object is _relative_ not absolute.  Any motion the ship
is making relative to an object is not retained unless that object comes
with the ship to provide a frame of reference.

For example when a ship jumps it retains its own individual velocity
relative to the section of space surrounding it because the ship brings
a meter or so of this vacuum with it thereby providing a frame of
reference to retain this velocity.  However since the jump ship does not
bring the sun it was orbitting with it the ship _looses_ all the
movement caused by the stars velocity relative to the target stars
velocity.  When ships drop out of jump they still have any personal
velocity relative to the vaccum around them but have lost whatever
velocity that space had. This handwave eliminates needless calculations
and relies on assumed properties of jumpspace so it should be impossible
to prove it incorrect.

Energy is not being created it is merely being tranfered between our
universe and the Jumpspace universe.

I tried to run a Traveller campaign way back in college
for a group of D&D\'rs. Their job was to recover a scout
team on a planet in the Vanguard Reaches sector. The
adventure would escalate to them leading a human
revolution (or so I hoped).

In typical D&D fashion, they charged, with ACRs
blazing and in broad daylight, the heavily armed
compound where the scout team was being held.

\'sigh\'

Shortest campaign I ever ran.

The underlying premise was that all robots didn\'t have
Asimov\'s Rules of Robotics programmed into them and
some moron told a military command center to shut
down "everything" as he left for the day. When the
system asked for clairification as to what needed to
be shut down, being tired and irritated after a long
day, the idjut said "everything you can access".

Problem is the center could "access" most of the world
with its missile complexes and warbot supplemental
troops.

Simplistic but, what the heck, it was the early 80\'s.

In HG, flicker amounted to armor as defense, with
a penalty to outgoing fire/maneuver/agility, or
something.

A group of four worlds, including Entrope and its three neighbors. Entrope 
had a much better spaceport before the last takeover by the Sword Worlds. All 
facilities were destroyed to prevent Entrope from serving as a base for 
Darrian ships. The starport is still little more than a cleared space and a 
customs shed. Fuel may be obtained from the ocean since there are no gas 
giants. Entrope\'s current leader is Major Kerin Yoldat, a war hero who was 
responsible for the coup that swayed Entrope\'s ground forces to the Darrian 
side at the time of the invasion that retook the planet. Major Yoldat is 
still investigating former collaborators and Sword World immigrants, 
expelling or imprisoning some of them. Weapons are not actually outlawed, but 
it takes a time-consuming background check to get a permit to carry one. 

Of the other Entropic Worlds, Winston was thinly colonized before it was 
taken over and lost a great deal of its population and technology in repeated 
fighting with the Sword Worlds. Some nations are still sympathetic to the 
Sword Worlds, but most are loyal to Darrian. Anselhome is a large asteroid 
which attracted colonists because of its wealth of ores. Living quarters are 
hollowed into the rock. Some of the atmosphere for the underground habitats 
is processed from the gasses put out by Anselhome\'s volcanoes. The only 
native life (whose existence amazed some scientists) is bacteria and lichens 
in the low-lying valleys. Finally, Torment is a prison planet for the most 
incorrigible of criminals, those whom Darrian psychologists have judged 
impossible to cure of violent tendencies. It is miserably cold and barren, 
consisting only of the one central village of convicts. They are required to 
work in mining and industry to pay for the import of enough food to support 
them. A hierarchy of criminals who demand obedience from their fellow 
convicts runs the prison. This obedience has little to do with law and order, 
as might be expected. They select their own successors before dying.

THE IMPERIAL MEGACORPORATIONS

Millions of organizations do business within and without the Imperium. Most 
of these are limited to one or two worlds. A few thousand trade over one or 
more subsectors, a few hundred cover one or more sectors. Only a few firms 
are truly Imperial in scope; these are known as megacorporations. Staggering 
in size, these organizations are so large that no one person can know 
everything they are concerned with at any given moment. Total shares of 
stock, annual profits, number of employees are all astronomical. Many 
organizations are so large that different divisions of the same 
megacorporation may actually be working at cross-purposes. In most regions, 
megacorporations merely own the land their installations are on, but in some 
areas they control entire planets, either directly or indirectly.

Most megacorporations are organized very much like smaller companies (with a 
board of directors, a president, and vice presidents), but the board and the 
higher level executive officers of the company are largely out of contact 
with the day to day (or even year to year) functioning of the company. These 
upper level executives serve to plan general policy and long distance 
actions. The most important executives, in terms of personal power, are the 
various regional managers (by whatever name they may be called). A regional 
manager may control only a small portion of a megacorporation\'s total assets, 
but many hold more power in some regions than the representatives of the 
Imperial government.

A small number of Imperial regulatory agencies have power over 
megacorporations, and they are subject to any applicable local taxes, but, 
provided they do not blatantly violate Imperial sovereignty, regional 
managers can usually conduct their company\'s business as they see fit. 
Because a direct confrontation with the Imperium would be bad for business, 
intentional violation of Imperial laws is done only on a covert basis.

TITLES

Except for those pre-dating the Imperium, all corporations engaging in 
interstellar commerce is required to possess an Imperial charter. The letters 
LIC following the company name indicates this. LIC stands for Limited 
liability Imperial Charter. Occasionally, corporations make use of archaic 
titles, such as the Terran LTD, Inc, Amt, AG, SA, etc. This is done either to 
indicate that the com an predates the Third Imperium (rarely the case) or to 
add charm and quaintness to the title.

A few Vilani megacorporations are still in business under their Vilani titles 
(Makhidkarun, Naasirka, Sharurshid, and Zirunkariish). The names, at least, 
date back to 1st Imperium times, and were the names of the Imperial 
organizations, half-industrial trusts, and half-government bureaus, which 
controlled commerce in the Vilani Imperium.

CAPSULE DESCRIPTIONS

Space considerations prohibit a complete description of the activities of 
every megacorporation. The following are basic descriptions.

Delgado Trading, LIC: Originally a manufacturer of military hardware and 
widely known for their work in miniaturization, Delgado has extensive 
holdings in heavy mineral mining and refining, publishing, antiquities 
trading, and recently, the toy industry. Founded in 997, Delgado is the 
youngest of the megacorporations. Stock ownership: Imperial family- 5%, 
Delgado family- 47%, Noble families- 27%, Private ownership- 21%

General Products, LIC: Largely concerned with heavy industry, General is a 
manufacturer of starships, non-starships, and heavy machinery of all sorts. 
General is known for inexpensive products of adequate quality, but of late 
its starship division (particularly its military products) has been plagued 
with disaster.
The corporation was formed by the merger of a number smaller manufacturing 
concerns shortly aftermath; end of the Civil War, in the period 620 to 622.

Stock ownership: Imperial family- 5%, Hortalez et Cie- 26%, Noble families- 
35%, Privateownership- 12%, Antares Holdings, LIC- 12%, Other- 10 %

GSbAG: Founded, according to company propaganda, in -2438 from a consortium 
of old Terran manufacturing firms. In actual fact, there is no concrete 
evidence of the corporation\'s existence prior to a contract with the Sylean 
Federation Navy in -334. Unlike other manufacturers, GSbAG (popularly known 
as Gas-bag) has restricted itself almost exclusively to the manufacture of 
starships since its earliest known existence.

GSbAG is one of two firms charged with the manufacture of the personal 
vessels of the Imperial family and is a major contractor for the Imperial 
military. Their products command extremely high prices, but it is gerierally 
conceded that the quality makes them well worth it.
Stock ownership: Hortalez et Cie- 19%, Imperial family- 4%, Noble families, 
(includes the families of the legendary founders)- 44%, Other corporations- 
13%, Private investors- 4%, Other-16%

Hortalez et Cie, LIC: Founded in 221 by Lucienne Hortalez, capitalized from 
family funds. Primarily a banking and investment house, Hortelez specializes 
in loans to planetary governments, mercenary unit bonding, underwriting of 
large scale projects of all sorts, and other fiscal activities. Hortelez is 
one of the major insurance houses in the Imperium. In some regions (the 
Spinward Marches especialIyI the firm acts as a mercenary clearinghouse.

Stock ownership: Hortalez family- 74%, Other corporations- 15%, Imperial 
family- 5%, Other- 6%

Instellarms, LIC: Founded in 626, shortly after the end of the Civil War, by 
Axel Murdoch, a retired colonel of mercenaries. Taking advantage of inside 
contacts in the Imperial military, Murdoch was able to obtain large 
quantities of surplus military equipment at very low prices, but still 
costing billions of credits. Where Murdoch got his financing is not known.
Murdoch\'s connections with various mercenary unit commanders coupled with a 
willingness to ignore the Imperial regulations on mercenary warfare where the 
profits were large enough enabled Instellarms to dominate the mercenary arms 
trade in the coreward sectors of the Imperium within ninety years, and in the 
Imperium as a whole within two centuries.

Manufacturing, buying, and selling military equipment of all sorts, 
Instellarms a specialty supplier of mercenary units of all sizes and types. 
Agents of the firm can often be found on a battlefield, negotiating the 
purchase of the equipment of the losing side before the battle is completely 
over. The company does not deal in interstellar vessels and chemical, 
bacteriological, or nuclear weaponry, but these can sometimes be obtained on 
low law level worlds for astronomical prices.

Stock ownership: Murdoch Holdings, LIC- 32% Hortalez et Cie- 30%, Noble 
families- 8%, Ling-Standard Products- 6%, Ichiban Interstellar, LIC- 5%, 
GSbAG- 5%, Sternmetal Horizons, LIC- 8%, Other- 6%

Ling-Standard Products: Originally a mining firm (and still very active in 
this area) LSP curreritly engages in a wide spectrum of activities including 
(but by no means limited to) manufacture of electronic equipment of all 
sorts, ground and air vehicles, starships and starship armaments systems, 
drive systems, power systems, computer systems and software, small arms, and 
a variety of other items. Concerned to a small degree with banking, 
insurance, and other activities, LSP maintains mining and manufacturing 
facilities throughout the Imperium and beyond.

Stock ownership: Imperial family- 8%, Hortalez et Cie- 26%, GSbAG- 23%, Noble 
families- 8%, Murdoch Holdings, LIC- 8%, Other- 27%

Makhidkarun: The origins of this company are shrouded in the mists of the 
Long Night. All that can be stated with certainty is that its foundation 
pre-dates the Third Imperium. Makhidkarun specializes in the communications 
and entertainment industries. The firm produces fine musical recordings of 
all types, two and three dimensional motion pictures, books, magazines, and 
art reproductions of all sorts. Its communucations division produces a wide 
variety of data processing, storage, and retrieval equipment and the 
requisite software for it. A gourmet foods division trades in all manner of 
rare and expensive foods, wines, and delicacies.

Stock ownership: Imperial family- 5%, Noble families- 28%, Hortalez et Cie- 
28%, Investment trusts- 25%, Private ownership- 14%

Naasirka: Naasirka specializes in the manufacture of information storage an 
processing equipment and software, computers, robots, and other complex 
electronic devices. The firm is a Vilani megacorporation of uncertain 
lineage, but it known to have been in business prior to the founding of the 
Sylean Federation. Naasirka is the largest supplier of communications 
equipment to the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service\'s xboat branch.

Stock ownership: Imperial family- 4%, Investment trusts- 24%, Noble families- 
23%, Hortalez et Cie- 11%, Other corporations- 14%, Igsiirdi family- 13%, 
Private ownership- 11%

SuSAG, LIC (Schunamann und Sohn AG, LIC): SuSAG engages in a wide range of 
chemical, pharmaceutical, and geneering activities. SuSAG is the primary 
manufacturer of anagathics for the Imperium, and maintains psi drug 
manufacturing plants in certain client states outside Imperial borders. 
Because of the bad reputation for safety of its chemical/biological warfare 
division, the firm is not well liked in many regions, even though all of 
SuSAG\'s dangerous manufacturing plants and experimental stations are located 
on remote, uninhabited planetoids. Since sabotage of its plants is 
widespread, and its products extremely valuable, the firm maintains a large 
paramilitary security force, equipped to tech level 12-14 standards. SuSAG 
was founded in 252 by Gustav Schunamann, financed from royalties received for 
his purification process for various psionic drugs, and using the shell of a 
bankrupt Sylean firm (hence the archaic AG in its name). In 800, psi drugs 
were declared illegal, all plants engaged in their manufacture within the 
Imperium closed, and all stocks confiscated and destroyed. Fortunately for 
SuSAG, the firm had by then expanded into other operations, and although 
badly damaged, managed to survive and prosper. SuSAG often engages in 
clandestine military ventures (using mercenary units) to protect their 
extra-Imperial interests.

Stock ownership: Schunamann family- 52%, Imperial family- 2%, Hortalez et 
Cie- 9%, Other corporations- 23%, Private ownership- 7%, Other- 6%

Sharurshid: A Vilani trade and speculation corporation, with very little 
manufacturing capability, Sharurshid trades in luxury goods from all parts of 
the Imperium and many areas beyond. Most rare Terran wines and spirits are 
carried on the starships of Sharurshid.
Stock ownership: Sharurshid trust- 46%, Imperial family- 3%, Other 
corporations- 14%, Zirunkariish- 13%, Hortalez et Cie- 14%, Private 
ownership- 10%

Sternmetal Horizons, LIC: Sternmetal is primarily engaged in mining 
operations and manufacturing. It produces mostly power generation equipment 
of all types, including power plants for starships, air and ground vehicles, 
cities, and industrial installations. Additionally, Sternmetal is the largest 
manufacturer of food synthesis equipment in the Imperium.
Stock Ownership: Imperial family- 2%, Hortalez et Cie- 29%, Investment 
trusts- 32%, Noble families- 18%, Antares Holdings, LIC- 19%

Tukera Lines, LIC: Tukera Lines operates a vast fleet of passenger and 
freight vessels throughout the Imperium, following the xboat lines. In some 
subsectors (particularly the older, more established regions of the Imperium) 
Tukera Lines has a virtual monopoly on long distance shipping and travel.
The oldest record of the firm is a charter from the government of the Sylean 
Federation, but family tradition holds the company to be several centuries 
older.
Stock Ownership: Tukera family- 29%, Imperial family- 3%, Other corporations- 
9%, Private ownership- 31%, Investment trusts- 28%

Zirunkariish: A Vilani banking and investment company. Unlike most other 
Vilani megacorporatioris, whose origins are shrouded in mystery, Zirunkariish 
is known to have been founded by the noble Vilani family of Shiishuginsa (a 
member of which, Antiama, married the emperor Zhakirov in 679) in the year 
- -425.
Zirunkariish is one of the largest insurance underwriters in the Imperium, 
and while its capital reserves are gigantic, it usually chooses to invest 
them in various trusts rather than in other megacorporations.

Stock ownership: Shiishuginsa family- 29%, Imperial family- 18%, Sharurshid 
trust- 17%, Hortalez et Cie- 7%, Noble families- 12%, Investment trusts- 8%, 
Private ownership- 9%


THE NEXT STEP

These are the sources from which players may select to build their faction. 
Upon selection of the agency or organization from which the faction draws its 
support, the player should begin to design a network of characters with which 
to interact within the play environment. It is not necessary to construct all 
the characters in a faction network immediately. It is strongly suggested 
that players first identify position and locations that they wish to place 
their characters first. Actual character creation is only necessary when the 
player intends to begin receiving information from that character about the 
play environment. The level of detail given to the character, the more 
information the referee will be able to provide the player from that 
characters observations or interacting with the play environment. 

Although the campaign is designed as a GURPS TRAVELLER adventure, any version 
of Traveller is acceptable for character creation. It is recommended that 
players make use of the GURPS TRAVELLER character templates to create their 
characters. The referee makes extensive use of character creation software 
featured at the Steve Jackson Games website. Characters created using the GCA 
or GCM programs can simply email the character files to the referee. 

Again the general format of this campaign is strategic control of character 
assets to achieve geopolitical goals and objectives. Players should think in 
terms of being a case officer handling agents. The characters in turn will 
control various playable assets such as starships, troops, or commercial 
enterprises. The objective of the campaign is to fully develop your faction, 
and to achieve the faction\'s victory conditions.

The victory conditions for each faction are simple, control of the Entropic 
Worlds. Once the faction is identified and the characters are beginning to 
take shape. The player should focus on how and why their faction would want 
control of the Entropic Worlds. The Sword Worlds could want the Entropic 
Worlds as a stepping stone to the spinward frontiers outside the Spinward 
Marches. The Darrians may see them as the stepping stone for a Darrian 
invasion. The Zhodani may see the Entropic Worlds as a bastion against 
further Imperial expansion toward the Consulate. The specific reasons for the 
faction\'s interest is left up to the player and will be developed during 
play. 

CAMPAIGN FORMAT

The player will submit turns in a format that provides identification and 
instructions for each character controlled. The level of detail is determined 
by the play action currently underway.  The referee based on the character\'s 
description and player placement of the character will assign character 
assets such as contacts, subordinates and equipment.

Turn 0

The Entropic Worlds Campaign is not like the average role playing game 
adventure. Rather than playing a specific individual character, players are 
called up on to play a group or cell of characters. The characters all have 
the unifying factor of being part of a single group with the same goals and 
objectives: the player\'s goals and objectives. 

The first step in preparing to play in the Entropic Worlds campaign is to 
decide what group or faction the player wishes to represent in the campaign. 
A general understanding of the Traveller Universe is helpful in making this 
decision. 

THE IMPERIUM

The Imperium is a far-flung interstellar community encompassing over 1100 
worlds within a region approximately 700 parsecs across. It has now ruled its 
territory for eleven centuries and looks to continue for many more. 
Interstellar government over such a large area, however, becomes a 
philosophical question; the problem initially seeming to be insurmountable. 
Distance, travel time, and communication lag all conspire against a 
functioning, efficient structure which can meet the needs of its subject 
population. But the lessons of history serve as a guide. Spain in the 16th 
century ruled much of the New World, with travel times of up to a year 
between the seat of government and the new territories. In fact, through most 
of history timely governmental communication, with both a rapid dispatch of 
instructions and an equally rapid response, has been a dream, not a reality.

The Imperium has come upon two solutions, which together ameliorate the 
problems of distance: the xboat network and feudalism. The Xboat Network: 
Like the body, with its network of veins and arteries, the Imperium is 
permeated by a network of xboat routes, or links, devoted entirely to the 
carriage of messages for official, commercial, and private purposes. The 
express boat (xboat) is a small, fast ship filled with a pilot compartment, 
message data banks, and jump drives. The fit is so tight that the tiny ships 
don\'t have maneuver drives. Each is capable of jump-4 (four parsecs in a 
week); it jumps, relays its messages to the station on arrival, and then 
waits to be picked up by a tender, refueled, and sent on its way to the next 
station on the route. The local station on a world accepts messages, encodes 
them, and transmits them to a station at the edge of the stellar system. The 
network works like the pony express with messages always moving at top speed. 
Transfer time for the messages from one xboat to another can be as short as 
ten minutes, and is rarely more than an hour.

Ultimately, the little xboats make their way to one of the many Imperial Way 
Stations scattered throughout the Imperium\'s subsectors. There they are 
refitted, overhauled, and refurbished, only to be sent on their way again. 
The xboat network makes the edge of the Imperium about 44 weeks out from the 
core and capital; that represents a savings of better than 50% of normal 
travel time. And still the Imperium is straining under the effects of 
distance. Feudalism: With such great distances separating stellar systems, 
individual responsibility and authority become of great importance. The 
Imperium is divided into sectors (twenty of them), each about 32 parsecs by 
40 parsecs in size. Each sector is divided into sixteen subsectors (8 by 10 
parsecs). And within a sector are perhaps thirty or forty systems, each with 
a star, worlds, and satellites.

Individual worlds, and even entire systems, are free to govern themselves as 
they desire, provided that ultimate power is always accorded the Imperium. 
Interstellar government begins at the subsector level - on one world 
designated the subsector capital. The ruling figure at the subsector capital 
is a high-ranking noble selected by higher levels of government. This duke 
has a free hand in government, and is subject only to broad guidelines from 
his superiors. But at the same time, the duke owes fealty to the higher 
levels of government, ultimately to the Emperor himself. The feudal approach 
depends greatly on a sense of honor, one cultivated by the hereditary 
aristocracy. This sense of honor is very strong within the Imperium has 
proven essential to the survival of such a far-flung community.

INTERSTELLAR SOCIETY

The known interstellar community encompasses thousands of worlds, many of 
them inhabited, and not all by humaniti. The number of intelligent life forms 
which have been contacted is quite high; within the Imperium itself, over one 
hundred intelligent species have been identified. When regions beyond the 
Imperial boundaries are included, the total number rises to well over four 
hundred. Major and Minor Races: A superficial classification system for the 
various intelligent races have been created, based on empirical evidence and 
to some extent on tradition. In general, the dominant races of known space 
are those which have achieved FTL (faster than light) travel by themselves, 
rather than receiving it through contact with starfaring civilizations. These 
dominant races are called major races; all others are called minor races. 
Thus, the term major race has become attached to any race that achieves FTL 
flight on its own, regardless of its prominence. There are sound reasons for 
the mixing of these two concepts: races which developed FTL rapidly expanded 
into space, spreading their influence across the stars. Slower races were 
contacted before they had a chance to discover the FTL secret and emerged 
into a universe already controlled by the major races. Indeed, the culture 
shock of being found by a superior race (often superior only in their 
knowledge of FTL) may take something out of the race as a whole, making them 
incapable of denying their secondary role in interstellar society. The 
classification scheme is, of course, simplistic, but the major races tend to 
perpetuate it as it to their advantage.

The Six Races: Similar to the major/minor race division is the concept of the 
Six Races. The origin of the term is uncertain, but it appears independently 
in Aslan, Vargr, and Centaur sources. There is some disagreement as to the 
proper identification of the Six, but most commentators agree that all must 
be major races. The most common definition was once Aslan, Centaurs, Hive, 
Vargr, Zhodani, and Imperials (both Solomani and Vilani). The confirmation 
(in 790, Imperial date) of multiple worlds inhabited by the Droyne, and of 
archeological evidence that they possessed FTL travel before the entry of any 
of the modern dominant races into space gave new weight to the Six Race 
concept. With the inclusion of the Droyne, Humaniti could be neatly 
categorized as one race, clearing the way for a classification that included 
six truly distinct races: Aslan, Centaurs, Droyne, Hive, Humans, and Vargr.

Aslan are roughly human-sized and are descended from four-limbed, upright, 
bipedal carnivore/pouncer stock. The earliest Terran explorers saw in them a 
vague resemblance to the Terran lion, and they have been described (by 
Terrans) as lion-like ever since, although there is very little true 
similarity.
Centaurs (they call themselves the K\'kree) are among the most massive of the 
major races, and are the only examples of the major races descended from 
herbivores. Centaurs are conservative, gregarious with their own kind (to the 
point of distress if isolated) and claustrophobic. These characteristics 
derive from their evolutionary origins as herd animals.

Droyne are a small race, both in stature and in dominion, with only limited 
settlements on a small number of worlds. The history of their evolution is a 
puzzle as their home world is not known with certainty. The Droyne have no 
empires, and actually rule only a few worlds. In some few cases, they possess 
the technology to introduce sophisticated machinery, including jump drives 
and starships, but they remain apparently content to stay on their own 
worlds. Humaniti (old spelling: humanity) is a special case. Originally 
evolved on Terra, humans were disseminated over nearly fifty worlds about 
300,000 years ago by the Ancients, a now extinct intelligent race. These 
various examples of humaniti then independently developed. Unlike non-human 
races, individual human races are classified as major or minor. Three human 
races (the Solomani of Terra, the Vilani of the First Imperium, and the 
Zhodani far to spinward) are major races. The nearly forty other races of 
humaniti are all minor.

Vargr are an intelligent race genetically manipulated from carnivore/chaser 
stock by the same Ancients who disseminated humaniti to the stars. Vargr have 
long suffered from an inability to organize themselves (to any degree or for 
any length of time) beyond the star system level, and their empires tend to 
rise and fall with unsurprising regularity. Vargr have an intense racial 
pride, and are easily insulted. They are prone to enter into fights without 
regard for possible consequences.

Hivers (a human term applied to them) are the most obviously alien of the 
major races: They are descended from omnivore gatherer/scavenger stock, and 
are unique in that they attained a form of agriculture before they became 
sentient. They exhibit a six-fold radial symmetry. The body has an internal 
skeleton consisting of a series of rings supporting the limbs, while a fused 
carapace protects the internal organs. Hivers themselves are highly 
individualistic (the term hive is an early misconception) while driven by 
basic drives such as curiosity, the parental instinct, and a desire to 
maintain the unity and uniformity of their race.

Within The Imperium: The many worlds of the Imperium shelter hundreds of 
races, including many of the major races. Aslan, Vargr, and Humans can be 
expected in many areas under Imperial rule. Zhodani, Centaurs, and Hivers, 
for various reasons, are much more infrequently encountered, and for the most 
part remain within their own regions.

PSIONICS

The concept of psionics is a strong point in the fabric of the Imperium. 
Until about 800, psionics were only weakly defined. Their achievement and 
distribution was only scattered. Humaniti has a strong potential for 
psionics, but its achievement requires both training and discipline. Other 
races have varying psionics potentials, with only limited interchangability 
between races, but psionics has never reached the great level of social 
importance as for humaniti. Zhodani cultures have consistently trained their 
nobles (only) in the use of psionics. In the Imperium, such training was 
originally a hobby or an avocation, but rarely of any value in the real 
world. In the period 600 to 800, the Psionics Institute began a campaign for 
more interest. Poorly timed, it coincided with PR backlash against the 
Zhodani (already the perpetrators of several wars against the Imperium). The 
result was a genuine revulsion on the part of most of the Imperial 
population- against psionics. This dislike is expressed differently on 
differently on different worlds, and has tended, in the past three centuries, 
to keep psionics on a clandestine, hobby-oriented, and slightly prurient, 
level.

THE ZHODANI

Human major race (H. sapiens) inhabiting the Zhodani Consulate, a region far 
spinward of the Imperium.
The Zhodani are a branch of humaniti similar in most respects to other human 
races. In general, they tend to be taller than Solomani or Vilani, and lithe 
of build. Their most important difference is the acceptance and use of 
psionics. Zhodani society is divided into three classes: nobles, intendants, 
and proles. Nobles are the enfranchised ruling class, and receive psionic 
training from childhood. Intendants are managers and administrators of 
society, and also receive early training. Proles constitute the masses, are 
forbidden the use of psionics, and do not receive training. Within this rigid 
class system, there are two opportunities for promotion to a higher class. 
All prole children are tested for psionic potential, those that then show 
high scores are then taken from their families and adopted into the intendant 
class. Intendants are rewarded for great diligence, service to the state, or 
victory in the psionic games through the granting of noble titles.

The presence of psionics in the hands of those in power means that many 
aspects of society work at high efficiency. Psychology, behavioral science, 
communications science, and education are more refined and exact than in 
other societies. Educational methods are finely tuned, and capable of 
teaching concepts rapidly and accurately. Mental deviance or criminal 
tendencies can be detected early and corrected with facility. Zhodani society 
is generally a happy one. Individuals are members of a functioning whole, 
with each making a contribution to its success. The relative lack of upward 
mobility for the proles is offset by the possibility for their children to 
move upwards if they have the proper potential. The burden of responsibility 
imposed on the intendants is lightened by the ever-present possibility of 
reward through elevation to the noble classes. The nobles themselves temper 
their burden of authority with comfort derived from their station in life.

Morality: The Zhodani have a general distaste for other human races which do 
not practice psionics. Effective indoctrination and ever-present possibility 
that one\'s mind is being read have removed dishonesty and deviance as common 
features of society. Disagreements still occur, competition thrives, passions 
flare. But all takes place in an atmosphere of honesty and truth. Individuals 
can express their feelings without fear and problems are openly dealt with. 
In non-psionic societies much is kept secret within the mind. The deviousness 
and dishonesty that pervades society would appall a Zhodani visiting the 
Imperium. Imperial distaste for the Zhodani is based on two facts. First, the 
Zhodani practice psionics, and an Imperial cannot be sure that a Zhodani is 
not invading his mental privacy at any time. Imperials feel exposed and 
uncomfortable in the presence of Zhodani. Second, because of their psionic 
abilities, the Zhodani have the most effective authoritarian rule in history. 
Imperial citizens used to a great degree of local autonomy, fear Zhodani 
conquest because of the loss of freedom it would entail.

Government: The Zhodani consulate is a participatory democracy in which only 
nobles are allowed to vote. Executive and judicial functions are the 
responsibility of a series of councils of varying sizes. Each council elects 
one of its number as executive officer, and a number of its members as 
delegates to the next higher council. A city, for example, will elect several 
of its council members to be representatives to the world council. The 
process continues upward through several layers of councils to the overall 
Grand Council of the Zhodani. Nominally, each member of a council serves for 
one Olympiad (three Zhodani years), but in practice, each councilor serves 
until his replacement arrives and replaces him officially, or until word of 
his re-election to another term is received. Often times, the district from 
which a councilor is elected will have only his relatives as voters, and his 
re-election is virtually assured.

Standard practice (when possible) calls for Zhodani councils to submit 
important questions to a plebiscite of those affected. The principle can be 
suspended where immediate action is required, but the official ordering the 
action stands responsible to the voters and must justify his actions as soon 
as possible.
Supreme executive power is vested in three consuls one elected each year for 
a term of one Olympiad by and from the members of the Grand Council. No 
consul may be elected twice in succession, and retired consuls become life 
members of the Grand Council.

History: The Zhodani date their empire from the traditional date of the first 
organized use of psionics on Zhodane, -6731 Imperial, the year of the first 
Olympiad. They achieved jump drive about 1300 years later, in -5415 Imperial. 
The expansion of the Zhodani was gradual and uneventful. Although some states 
on the fringe-resisted absorption into the Consulate, most were annexed 
peacefully. The Zhodani first came into conflict with the expanding Third 
Imperium in the 500\'s, starting the First Frontier War in a dispute over 
present and future limits to settlement in the Spinward Marches area. 
Continuing frontier wars over the next five hundred years have failed to 
resolve the basic differences between the two empires.

THE DARRIAN CONFEDERATION

An association of worlds inhabited primarily by members of the Darrian human 
minor race, settled during the period -1137 to -927. The Confederation, 
consisting of 21 worlds, lies spinward of the Sword Worlds in the Spinward 
Marches. The current capital is Mire. The Darrian Confederation contains 18 
worlds, all within the same subsector, and has a population of 17.19 billion. 
Darrians are Humans who have developed independently on Darrian (see humans). 
Some Solomani blood is evident as Solomani traders encountered Darrian in 
- -1511 and provided them with sufficient technology to explore the subsector.

The Darrian Confederation is an ally of the Imperium, and has been 
historically opposed to the Sword Worlds and the Zhodani Consulate.

THE SWORD WORLD CONFEDERACY

A loose confederation of worlds in the Spinward Marches, spinward of Imperial 
space and coreward of the Darrians. The first settlement in the region was on 
Gram in -399. By ca. -200 the settlement of the area was largely complete, 
and the first interstellar government in the region, the Sacnoth Dominate, 
was formed in -186. Consisting of the twenty worlds settled up to that point, 
the Dominate lasted until -102, when it was fractured by rebellion into 
several smaller states.

During the ensuing centuries, various Sword World governments rose and fell, 
sometimes coalescing all the worlds under a single world\'s domination, 
sometimes splintering into several small states. Contact with Imperial 
traders in 73 brought increased trade and had a stabilizing influence on the 
region, but this stability was short-lived. The First Frontier War brought a 
desire for cooperation among the various squabbling worlds, and the end of 
the war saw the formation of the first unified confederation in centuries, 
centered on Sacnoth, and referred to as the Second Dominate. As a result of 
the Outworld Coalition\'s victory, the Sword Worlds annexed Terant 340, 
Torment, Trifuge, and Cunnonic, all in the Darrian subsector.

The Second Dominate held power until 698, when it was overthrown by a 
coalition headed by Gram. The Gram Coalition ruled until 788, when a short 
war with the Darrian Confederation resulted in the loss of the four worlds 
gained during the First Frontier War. Public outrage at the mishandling of 
the war caused the subsequent fall of the Gram government. The replacement 
for the Gram Coalition was the Trilateral Alliance, a decentralized 
organization headed by Narsil, Sacnoth, and Durendal. The Alliance broke up 
in 848, due in large part to the inherent weakness of its organization, and 
an interregnum of essentially independent worlds lasted until Gram reasserted 
its influence (helped substantially by Zhodani money and advisors, rumor has 
in 852. This government has remained in control down to the present.

The government allows almost complete local autonomy. Individual worlds 
maintain separate military forces, pass their own laws, and completely 
regulate their own internal affairs. The Confederation government regulates 
interworld trade, diplomatic relations with outside powers, and adjudicates 
interworld disputes. In peacetime, the Confederation government maintains a 
pool of high-ranking military officers selected from the military forces of 
all worlds who are trained in large unit command and staff operations.

During time of war, all military forces are confederalized, and placed under 
a single unified command. For ground forces, generals from the individual 
worlds, corps and higher organizations will command divisions by 
Confederation officers. The component forces of a division will be from the 
same world whenever possible. For naval forces, individual ships are under 
the command of local officers, squadrons or higher organizations under 
Confederation officers.

I actually like the system alot in practice.  During game play it makes the

allows non-military characters to muddle along in a military situation while

Well, it just seems to me that all the other skills being 1 less is
too close as skill levels go up.  Maybe divide by two would work
better.  This would give players a reason to put a point or two into
a second weapon...or a related skill in another group.


Example: 

During char gen the two characters get...
    A                   B
  Rifle-5             Rifle-0
  Pistol-2            Pistol-4
  Shotgun-4           Shotgun-0
  SMG-0               SMG-1

Rifle and Pistol are the high skills in the groups so we figure
Rifle/2, dn = 2,  and Pistol/2, dn = 2.
Now you adjust based on the specialties...
    A                    B
  Rifle-5              Rifle-0+2
  Pistol-2+2           Pistol-4
  Shotgun-4+2          Shotgun-0+2
  SMG-0+2              SMG-1+2
  
Giving a final totals of...
    A                    B
  Rifle-5  (5)         Rifle-2 (0)
  Pistol-4 (2)         Pistol-4 (4)
  Shotgun-6 (4)        Shotgun-2 (0)
  SMG-2 (0)            SMG-3 (1)
  
The skill with the greatest number in (), the actual number for that
weapon, is always the one that you divide by two and add to the
others.  So, if in Example A, the Shotgun skill was ever improved to
6 it would become the one the others derived from.

Just an idea.

<Disclaimer:  None of these examples are meant to be in-depth analyses>

Economics:  Store A sells a gallon of milk for $2.00
                       Store B sells a gallon of milk for $4.00

We might think that Store A will drive Store B out of business in short
order, however this is not the case.  Store A (also known as a Wal-Mart
SuperCenter) thrives and so does Store B (aka 7-11 Convenience Store), since
economics is only part of the equation.  Other factors play a role in the
success or failure of a store (or economic concern).

Market Forces:

The advantage of having a superior Technology does not always translate to
success in the marketplace.  Real Life(tm) is full of examples in which a
better technology was defeated due to marketing , consumer
demand/perception, installed base, or whatever.  The Nintendo Gameboy is a
good example. The Atari Jaguar and Sega Game Gear were both technologically
superior products.  (The GameBoy was obsolescent when it debuted, IMO)
However, Nintendo was able to take a large share of the market through
advertising, name recognition, and product support (game titles).

Infrastructure:

If Drop Tanks require Jump Stations to be used, then we also have problems
associated with infrastructure.  Aside from having them built and
maintained, Jump Stations will become a point where bottle necks could
occur.  This was probably the case with Starports as well, but they are now
part of the existing infrastructure....and presumably well adjusted to
specific traffic patterns

General:

Even if Drop Tanks are proven to have significant economic benefits, many
other forces will determine when and whether Drop Tanks are prevalent.  For
instance, I can imagine that any business that would lose money or market
share to Drop Tanks will be very aggressive in discrediting them, delaying
their introduction, and even worse, if not restrained by conscience or law.
Another problem might be that the public perceives them as dangerous it
would be difficult to build liners with Drop Tanks, as no one will travel on
them.  Vast conspiracies, bad luck, public apathy, conservatism, liberalism,
political climate, will all come together and have an effect on the adoption
or rejection of Drop Tanks.  Each GM will have to determine which forces
determine the outcome.

There really isn\'t any reason why the drop tanks described should
be either expensive or non-reusable.

I suppose one could arbitrarily say they are and wave your hands
about reasoning.  However, I always thought that introducing a
new technology and then saddling it with all sorts of arbitrary
constraints to be very hokey.  A PC looks at a technology that
is presenented as being for a specific purpose, he then sees
all sorts of other uses but each time there is some arbitrary
handwave that it won\'t work for those.  To me that is always
tranparently contrived and makes thing feel unrealistic.

Don\'t forget that GT shows what appears to be a formal portrait of the

Historians considered Napoleon to have made a major morale mistake during the 
beginning of the hundred days campaign, when he addressed his Guard wearing 
his Imperial robes, rather than his famous green Old Guard Dragoon uniform...

Ob Trav: What IS protocol for retired military personel? Can they wear their 
uniforms, or is that reserved for active duty only? If so; can they wear

I would make jumping to deep space a normal jump (no extra difficulty).
OTOH, jumping from deep space is a bit more tricky, because you do not have
any exact reference to where you are.  In a star system, you have a star
and planets within a couple of AU to get a reference from, in deep space
you don\'t.

Well, I seem to recall an additional roll to determine how far
"sideways" you go.

Here\'s a chart showing the odds of misjumping to various distances,
based on the roll for number of dice to roll for distance.
(ie distance = (1d6)d6 )

There are 279936 possible rolls.

It isn\'t a matter of jumping into deep space.  Its jumping to a specific point
in deep space that is tricky.

Interesting point.  Could gravitics technology be used to build a "jump
beacon" on a deep space site, that would assist jumping ships in exiting
jumpspace in the desired area, by artificially precipitating a ship from
jumpspace?  Or would an immense "bubble" of some material, filled with
gas at pressures barely greater than the vacuum of deep space, be more
effective?

In my Traveller universe, honorably discharged veterans of the Imperial
Scouts, Navy, Army, and Marines (member states have their own laws about
their veterans) are permitted to wear their full dress uniform to any
appropriate occasion.  Upon discharge, they are given a final
decoration, the Honorable Service Badge (also sometimes called the
honorable discharge badge), which they are required to wear whenever
they wear their uniform.  The HSB is a silver square, 3cm x 3cm, worn
with a point up, on the right breast.  Its center is a 1cm square hole,
representing the door out of service -- and that the door is always open
to reenlist, to be recalled in times of emergency (especially detached
duty Scouts), or to volunteer to help the Imperium.

"Appropriate occasions" include virtually any formal military,
political, academic, or cultural event.  

Undress uniform (also called utilities, fatigues, BDUs) without insignia
is commonly sold as surplus (especially to newly colonized worlds) and
may be worn by anyone.  Persons mustering out of service customarily
keep their own undress uniform(s), with subdued cloth insignia, and sew
a white (or sometimes black) diamond shape like the the HSB on their
right breast pockets.  It is technically a violation of Imperial law
(see regulations governing uniformed services) to wear an undress
uniform with Imperial insignia, but no veteran wearing a cloth or metal
HSB on their own undress has ever been prosecuted.  

If a PC, after mustering out, wants to buy cloth armor, I will generally
give him or her a difficult task roll to see if he or she was able to
"boost" BDUs made of cloth while still in service.

Just a minor quibble here, surely most ships should tend to run uncomfortably
warm
due to the diffculty of losing heat in a vacuum ?

Of course. I have an ulterior motive for this.

It means people running round in their underwear or less, a\' la Alien or 2001,
is quite common, at least on small ships. It means wearing one\'s vaccsuit all
the time is damn uncomfortable, making it less likely that PC\'s will claim
they are  wearing it whenever disaster strikes. It means wearing full dress
uniform and suits is also uncomfortable.

Soft cotton  vests/tee-shirts and matching pants are the most common ship
board wear. IMTU

Needless to say,  I enjoyed the opening sequence of the film Barbarella.

IMTU, the Imperium doesn\'t have a one way or another, however, there *are* 
laws against impersonating Imperial personnel.  <grin>

In the Principality of Caledon, IMTU, *anybody* who recieves an MCUF, MCG, or 
SEH-equivilent *must* wear a copy of it on their *civilian* formal wear, 
simular to the laws of the old Soviet Union concerning the various Order of 
Lenins and their display after the person recieving them is honorably 
discharged from military service.  Simular laws exist in the Duchy of Marlheim 
and the Carrillian Assembly.

I don\'t believe that standard gravitics would work (although the TL 21 jump damper
would).

Matter warps space-time which produces a side effect of gravity.   I think that
gravitics produce gravity simulating accelerations through some other means.  Its
the warping of space-time that precipitates you out of jumpspace.

As proof of canonicity, if gravitics could yank you out of jumpspace, then no ship
may have operating artificial gravity during a jump.

Yes, that will be a problem.  I would suggest deleting all sectors 
except for one and all Allegiances except for the ones you are using.

You can turn off the refresh and the map section of the screen 
before you load the datafile.  You can definately fit the db in 16 meg 
of ram.  The picture is what takes so many resources.

Hope this helps and let me know how it turns out.

The MT or TNE scope of skills seems about right to me, with a few
exceptions.  In all versions of Traveller, the skills associated
with Doctors, Engineers and Stewards have been too broad, IMO.

Breaking Medical, Engineering and Steward into four or five skills
adds a chance for a little specialization without going to the
extreme of a skill for *every* activity.

I think it might make sense to have a broad skill that serves as a
primary with specializations clustered under it.  For quick task
resolution and in a lot of general play you\'d just use the general
or primary skill, but you\'d also have the specializations for the
situations where you might want to use them. 

Take the Medical skill, for example.  

  Medical
    Diagnosis
    Physician
    Medical Electronics
    Trauma Care
    Surgery    

Now, I know Biology, Chemistry, Genetics, Psychology and probably
several other skills are important for Medic/Doctor type characters,
but just for now let\'s work with this group.

Somehow, and I\'m not entirely clear in my head how to work this <g>,
you would get a Medical skill which would be used for general
medicine tasks, but also gives *some* sort of specialization.
Maybe, it would work to assign two or three points to the
specializations of the players choice, with the proviso that no
specialization can exceed the general skill?

Example:

To become a licensed MD Joe has to get a have at least a 1 in all
the specializations.  He wants to specialize in Surgery, so he\'ll
concentrate there as best he can.

Joe completes Medical School receiving, among other things a
Medical-3, and 6 or 9 specializations. He distributes them.

  with 2 to 1                   with 3 to 1

  Medical-3                     Medical-3               
    Diagnosis-1                   Diagnosis-2           
    Physician-1                   Physician-1           
    Medical Electronics-1         Medical Electronics-1 
    Trauma Care-1                 Trauma Care-2         
    Surgery-2                     Surgery-3             

During his first term after Medical School, Joe works mainly in an
Emergency Room.  He gets another Medical skill and puts
specializations into Trauma Care, but he finds a way to continue
working on his Surgical specialty as well.

  Medical-4                     Medical-4               
    Diagnosis-1                   Diagnosis-2           
    Physician-1                   Physician-1           
    Medical Electronics-1         Medical Electronics-1 
    Trauma Care-2                 Trauma Care-4         
    Surgery-3                     Surgery-4             

During Joe\'s next term he continues his work in the hospital,
receiving another Medical.  He was working as a general surgeon, so
he can add to his Surgical skill, but he also works on his Diagnosis
and Physician skills.
 
  Medical-5                     Medical-5               
    Diagnosis-2                   Diagnosis-3           
    Physician-1                   Physician-2           
    Medical Electronics-1         Medical Electronics-1 
    Trauma Care-2                 Trauma Care-4         
    Surgery-4                     Surgery-5             

Geeze, this might work!  That 3 to 1 looks pretty good.  What do you
think?

~ So there we were, a few us just sitting around #traveller, having a
few adult beverages (Earl Grey for me) when I decided to bring up Seth\'s
idea about doing a big starship show. The gist of the idea was, "Hey,
you know how they have these big boat shows and car shows and even house
shows where the best and flashiest models are rounded up and displayed,
well..." ~

I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE that we are now accepting applications from
those shipbuilding firms who wish to display their wares. This site will
display your best one or two ship designs. The requirements are that
they be complete, meaning that there be at least:

One exterior graphic view - line drawings through ray-traced 3D
holographics accepted

Deck Plans - 2D, 3D, 4D, your choice

Design stats - any design system or level of detail accepted

This means that if you are big into deck plans, but don\'t do exterior
pix, that you may want to team up with someone who makes pretty
pictures. Collaborative designs may be the best. We are hoping to see
several small craft, as well.  They will be displayed at
http://www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/ssw_trav/ , which is being administered
(graciously) by Michel Vaillancourt. You can submit your completed
entries to him at ssw.trav@atlantic-online.ns.ca.

BTW, the designs that are on display now are very nice, very nice
indeed.  Where are the cheesy submissions?  Hey, this is Traveller,
here!  The Monty Haul Shipyards have put out more designs than most
firms ever thought of.  I want some CHEESE with my whine, eh?

Thank you Michel. ;->

I started playing back in late 77 when Traveller *was* the 3 LBB\'s
and there wasn\'t anything except a *very* general framework.  I
enjoyed all the suppliments and JOTAS articles that built up the
Imperium, but I never set my games in what became the OTU.  As CT
turned into MT it got much harder to use anything from GDW without
also using their universe..at least for me.  I don\'t oppose having
an OTU, but I still implore Marc, Loren and the BITS folks to make
the books them write general enough so, as Michel put it, "it
wouldn\'t choke me."

Considering the low reliability of eyewitness reports in crime

That, plus telepathy.

>BTW How does other refs play the use of truth drugs?

IMTU truth drugs put the user into a compliant, unagressive mood. For the
reasons above it is not overly valuable to investigations and, IMTU, more
often used for romantic seductions.

This sounds reasonable.

This does not. The life of an intelligence operative is very valuable and
should not be discarded so unnecessarily. Also, Survival Margin mentioned
necropathic probes which can recover mental impressions from dead bodies.

Why not use a virus which just counteracts the drug? IMTU, criminals and
intelligence agents are routinely given only the information required to
complete their mission, and never told anything that could implicate
others. This counteracts truth machines, psionic probes, and even double
agents.

From: <Sethkimmel@aol.com>
: I always thought that that SOMEBODY should reprint these adventures
(#1-13,
: and double adv. 1-6). I wish SJG would since they are doing the
approriate
: period with GURPS and it appears that T5 will cover a much earlier
period.

Marc mentioned doing some reprints with all of the Sups in one book, all
of the Adventures in another, etc. for the classic material.  This
sounds like a great silver anniversary project.  I wonder if Marc is
looking for a crusty old CT dude (or dudette) to take on the project?

OK. Economics ... lets assume that the builders lost leave of their senses
and paid all the bills in Imperial Credits, rather than in lower value
Equus etc credits. Ship therefore costs MCr 4344 (true cost should be about
IMCr 3350 or so). Note that either heavy political considerations or
Ditzie\'s drug intake featured heavily in the choice of components - mere
efficiency would indicate buying a TL15 power plant from Rhylanor to be the
most efficient method.

To earn an acceptable 5% rate of return, the ship therefore needs to return
MCr 217 in profit a year. Call it MCr 250 including costs (if paying with
discounted credits, it needs MCr 168 profit, or MCr 195 including costs).

Given 35 trips a year, this means a need for a net revenue of Cr 1110 net
per dton of cargo space (Cr 865 with discounted credits).

Now, we have 6450 dtons of cargo, and a need for 4800 dtons of jump fuel,
so every 1000 Imperial credits we have to pay for Jump Fuel will add ICr
740 to the minimum cargo price we need to charge.

Paying KCr 5 for drop tankage will therefore require us to charge Cr4810
for a jump 6 (Cr 4600 or so with discounted credits).

I\'ll repeat that number. KCr 5 for a jump-6, assuming you pay 5 kilocredits
a dton for jump fuel in drop tanks. If you are using tankers that charge
KCr 1 per dton for refined jump fuel (and if you allow drop tanks to pump
the fuel into the ship, I cant see the problem with using a tanker to do
the same), then moving that 1 dton lump of whatever six parsecs in one week
will cost you Cr 1850 (passengers in small staterooms take up 2 dtons,
remember).

Now, if these prices are true, then we can take this theory about slow
communication speeds hampering the Imperium, and throw them out the door.
Every major system (and most of the minor ones) *will* be linked by jump-6
drop freighters. 

You know you can link
Efate-Regina-Kkirka-Rhylanor-Natoko-Mora-Isurkin-Vincennes, and a spur line
down from Natoko-Lunion-Sting, with jump-6 ? The fast link from Mora to
Trin goes via empty hex 3239 (using a 100 dton jump-6 News Packet utilising
drop tanks then internal tankage), while the slow one goes Mora-Fens
Gren-Ramiva as jump-5, then a short jump-2 hop to Trin.

Cool. Assuming 7 days in hyperspace and a 2 day wait at each system (moving
in and out for cargo transfer and/or waiting for a tanker), it should mean
that our happy punters in Vincennes get the result of the Duke of Regina\'s
Own Huscarles\' victory at the First Cricket Test against His Excellency\'s
Gentlemen of the 213th within a round 2 months. In other words, before the
tour is over.

Now, people will certainly argue good old FUD - Fear, Uncertainty and
Doubt. FUD worked really well against the railroads, didnt it ... and we
are talking something as revolutionary, and as profitable.


Ian Whitchurch

PS I did the numbers for an internally-fuelled Mongerel Dog. It carries
1600 dton of cargo, implying a breakeven point of Cr 3500 a dton plus fuel
(call it a rough Cr 750 per parsec) to stay viable at 35 jumps a year.
Hmmmmmmmmmm. We may be in more trouble than I thought. Jump 6 ships are
looking quite economically viable, even with drop tanks neutered via your
favorite method.

Iolanthe was born in 1052 and married Strephon in 1079, therefore she
was 27 at the time, and Strephon was 30.  Their daughter Ciencia
Iphegenia was born in 1088, when Iolanthe was 36.  I do not believe that
the Emperoress career allows enough time for other activities.  I
suspect that Iolanthes career path was College, Noble, Noble.  In her
second term as a noble Iolanthe had special duty "marry the Emperor" &
got to rise two ranks in her career, from Soc F [daughter of the senior
Duke of the Gushmege Sector] to Soc H [Emperoress].  I note that the
library data says "Her primary avocation is the preservation of
developing cultures within the Imperium."  This could be interepreted as
evidence of a career as a Scout or an Academic but it seems more likely
to me that it is an interest she pursued during her terms as a Noble.

I assumed that the military, or strongly pseudo military, outfit she
wore in GURPS Traveller (pg 43) was the outfit of an outfit that she, as
Emperoress, is the head of - The Emperoress Own Something Or Others.  I
assumed she wore the outfit for this reason.  I suppose that it is
possible she choose to wear the military uniform so that no one would be
able to make fun of her civilian fashion choices but I assumed it was
merely a cynical attempt to dupe the members of the outfit into
believing she actually cared about them.

This one week will mean that rather than being able to do Glisten to Trane
and back 6 times a year, you can do it eight and a bit times. This
increases profit a lot, because you are making mroe actual money.

However, I\'m confused about the exact case - why in the name of the Credit
Imperial dont you just load the cargo into an A2 and be done with it in one
hit ?

Yes, but spaceships are cheaper than starships.

This assumes that passenger and freight rates are not at all affected by
distance, an assumption that is right up there with \'Imperial Knights fight

Sort of. Little guys could rent them by the hour.

See my Drop Tanks Redux post. It really is a signifigant impact.

Maybe not on a jump-1 ship.

On the other hand, they make jump 4-6 freight ships a lot more profitable,
which does really mean things to (say) the speed at which people heard
about the death of Strephon.

Plus you get filling stations/jump gates.

Well, if the tanker has a Dirty Big Gun, then I\'d call it a positive.

Cr 1000 sounds about right - Cr 350 per dton for the refined fuel, plus
another Cr 350 for the rental on the tanker ship, plus Cr 300 pure
unadulterated profit.

Either case makes the fuel-tank free freighter viable. And I for one dont

One of my theories is that you need a day to \'cool down\' for each 10 years
of effective jump drive age. New, highly tuned Corporate ships can do jump
after jump, while old, tired Free Traders need those 4-5 days in port, just
to allow the quantum vibrations in the zuchai crystals to die down.

Probably. But you also have to note that while that *is* a "peak" in

Except that you can take bearings on the stars...  And by taking many of

Coincidentally, the GURPS equivalents to the Medical Skill are:

Diagnosis
Physician
Surgeon
Electronic Operations (Medical)

so SJG, at least, agree with you...  :)

No coincidence. ;->  I picked a breakdown that matched GURPS on purpose.

Of course the fusion guns the armed escorts will be carrying will be used to cook with, right?

Each jump requires a quantity of liquid hydrogen. A portion is converted

"bubble" which separates and insulates the ship from jumpspace.*** For
convenience, all of the LH2 is called fuel; this is technically incorrect as
only a portion is actually burned to create energy but all of it is used up.

The *** are mine for emphasis.  The impact of the above is inconsequential
for CT, MT, TNE. For GURPS Traveller it is, however, quite significant. In
canon GT there is no problems with PC being able to use the massive energy
produced by the consumption of LHY for weapons, because no such massive
amount of energy is produced.  In fact since LHY must be vented into
jumpspace the drop tanks must be in jumpspace.  How else could they be used?
Unless you subscribe to the theory that a ship can open a hole in jumpspace,
stay at the normal space/jumpspace interface long enough to form a bubble
and then hurl the drop tanks out of the hole before it closed.

So what is a drop tank? I maintain that it is a demountable tank that can be
quickly shed after jump, instead of taking the longer time to remove
standard demountable tanks. At least in GURPS:Traveller.  (As always all
GURPS rules are optional)

It sorta looks that way, doesn\'t it?  I\'m debating about how it
can best be presented on Freelance Traveller, and trying to come
up with some intro/background for it.  Right now I\'m leaning
toward presenting it as though it were a compilation of letters
to the editor of a journal that focussed on policy analysis.
That\'s going to take a little bit of judicious editing, which I\'m
not sure I want to do.

I think that the general idea worked pretty well, and if others
agree, I might instigate more of these in the future, based on
other possible policy decisions, including possibly those leading
to key points in Imperial history (such as the granting of
autonomy to the Solomani, the subsequent question of recognition
of independence, the propriety of Arbellatra\'s assumption of the
Regency after the Civil Wars, and so on).

Methods to make computer programs and data forward-compatible have been
known since the 1960s. Software can be made forward-compatible through
virtual machines and Codd\'s relational rules. These methods are used in
some data formats, like PDF and XML.

Unfortunately, programmers find it easier to just modify internal data
structures and change opcodes than to normalize data, maintain external
references, or implement a VM. RTF and TIFF could have been
forward-compatible, but software companies felt it more necessary to expose
proprietary data than to maintain the standard.

What does this have to do with Traveller? Could those who write Traveller
software consider using XML and publishing the DTD? This would make their
files backward and forward-compatible, and usable by others.

        My first few games were set in Regina, 3i....  we were so busy
learning the rest of the game that things like creating 16-sector empires
with pen and paper were not high on the priority list...  ;)
        The first real campaign I ran was set very not OTU...  Terra was
just a legend and no one had ever been there or knew where to find it on a
star map...  16 different sentient races crammed into three sectors of
space...  An unkind but not evil empire with armed borders on all four
sides...  TL15+
        "The Near Earth Campaign (TNEC)" is what the name sounds like, but
none of my players need to go rushing out to Alpha Centari to meet the
Villani....  it\'s been a Terran colony now for 85 years and they only found
evidence of another sentient race about 12 years ago;  60ly from Sol...

	Great adventures ... I think Divine Intervention is a perfect way to
test a group of gamers to see whether they\'re hack & slash or more
... thinking-oriented. One group I ran through it wound up crashing
the entire palace and losing half their numbers; the other wound up
not killing *anybody* (even the assassins that came after them).

Pop quiz: Name your top three favorite official* Traveller
adventures, and why. 

*Official: CT, MT, TNE, T4 or GT; published by GDW, DGP, IG, or SJG,
either as a standalone product or as an article in the appropriate
"official" magazine.**

**Why restrict it to official: there\'s a better chance that others
have played the same adventure ...

Mine:

#1: Double Adventure 6: Divine Intervention--as stated above.

#2: Double Adventure ?: Chamax Plague--a fun "Aliens" type romp.
Watching the tension build in the party is great, especially if you
take your time working it up. Having NPC spearcarriers around makes
it even better. "Anybody seen Joe Redshirt? Dammit, I *told* him not
to go wandering off alone."  And then later when they find what\'s
left of a body ... rustling noises at night ... vibrations in the
ground ...

#3: Hmm ... I\'ll have to think about this.

Those are really light and voluminous gowns! The wonders of tech 15

I had missed that the passenger cargo was in kg in book 2.

By T4, the allowance is 1dT. Gurps is also 1dT.

I could be wrong but, airliner tech is not 40 years old.

40 years ago...

You didn\'t have the materials to make the wings or the turbine blades.

You couldn\'t even make the fabrics in the seats or the plastics
in the stowage bins.

You didn\'t have the computer tech to design the airframe or the
wind tunnels to test it.

You didn\'t have the machine tools to make the components.

I doubt you could even make 1% of a modern airliner using purely
1950\'s tech.

	FWIW, this is my preferred explanation as well.  It seems to conform 
best with canon background and creates fewer problems than other 
explanations.  There are just too many tricks you can pull commercially and 
militarily with the "drop-before-jump" tanks.

G\'day everyone,

I\'m new to this mailing list, so I hope I am not breaching any kind of
protocol here.  I have lurked on this list for the grand total of 24 hrs and
am moved to post so soon!  I do like the quality of many of the posts, but
the traffic on a couple of threads has not been great enough to fill me in
completely on their particular coverage.

However, I have enjoyed what I have read of this thread and feel I know
enough of it to contribute if I may.  The question from what I have read is
basically, "can a crew pilot a ship purposefully into and out of an "empty
system?"  Is that it?

As the above quote from Twilight Peak mentioned, officially it was possible.
Also, if I remember correctly, some other published adventures (MT?  TNE?)
and Challenge magazines had part of plots developed around IN placement of
fuel and supplies in empty "hexes" across various rifts in order for the IN
to make manoeuvres or strikes across these wide expanses of planetless voids
(these supplies now lost or forgotten due to the revolt/collapse, so the
PC\'s could make use of them or claim them. etc.).

This suggests that it is indeed possible and safe enough that the IN used it
as a practical means of Standard Operational Procedure.  The thing about
navigation in Traveller was not so much that the Navigator had to get out
his sextant and charts and take bearings, but he had to make readings his
Nav Computer produced, adjust them for the local system and basically let
the computer handle 90% or more of the in-system travel (via auto-pilot).

Now I\'m not going into the r/l causes and effects here, just the games rules
as they worked in the LBB-days.  A ship could be detected for example, on
trajectory-X before it switched on it\'s Black Globe as it entered jump which
enabled the trackers to follow it by sending a vessel into each and every
system (occupied and/or empty systems) along that trajectory up to the known
limit of the followed ship\'s jump number (if they knew the vessel to be only
J-2 capable, they could track it into the next hex or into the second hex on
the ship\'s trajectory).

This suggests that even with a misjump, the vessel exits jump heading in a
given direction (even if it comes out side ways or backwards).  The
Navigator does a few calculations on the Nav Computer and should be able to
tell the pilot, "We have to turn about and head out on these co-ords..."
with the only problem being that the Nav doesn\'t quite know exactly how far
they may have travelled?  If the jump into an empty system was intentional,
then the crew should know exactly where they are, the computers know exactly
where the ship is and can alter position quite safely in order to jump out
to wherever they want to go and so on.  Even r/l navigation computer devices
"can" be exceptionally accurate -- when adventuring in the "Far Future,"
where these machines are bread and butter, surely they have to be at least
99% accurate under all situations (other than lack of maintenance and such).

Well, I hope I haven\'t jumped in to deep here.

I gave my gear to a young lad who needed it more than me (sigh), but I
borrowed book 2 to check my memory wasn\'t as far gone as I feared (phew)...


Book 2:  Starships, p6
"Throw one die to determine the number of dice thrown (1 to 6); throw that
number of dice to determine the number of hexes in length the misjump is.
Then throw one die to determine the direction of the misjump (one of the six
directions possible on the hex grid).  Finally, throw one die to determine
the number of weeks spent in jump space before the ship re-emerges at it\'s
new location."

So jump is still a straight line as it should be (lateral movement in
jump?), hence the computer should be able to say what vector jump was exited
from.

You\'re right, but you\'re wrong too. That is, you\'re right that the slow
communication speeds hampering the Imperium is bushwah, but drop tanks don\'t
affect that one way or the other. Information is the one thing that would
be more expensive to send by drop tank ship (though not significantly so),
since a drop tank equipped ship is a bit more expensive than it\'s regular
counterpart.

OK, that one link would propably be cheaper with drop tanks than with deep

A confused, panicked dash through an alien city under attack.  Great for

Great short campaign for MT.  The first adventure was much better than the

(Cue the John Williams\' Raiders music)  Cutting through thick jungles,
ambushes at lost cities, human sacrifice, evil pseudo-nazis, mad dashes

Never had to think much on royalty wearing fashions to any extent, but I do
support the "as
Emperoress, is the head of - The Emperoress\' Own Something Or Others."  It
is interesting to note that in our r/w, Queen Elizabeth was a uniformed,
military ambulance driver during WWII, that her sons were all members of the
Royal Navy (and was it Prince Eddie that served in the Falklands as a
helo-pilot in the war zone?  But I know little of what the girls were into,
sorry), so I find it acceptable that Iolanthe could have been a serving
member of whatever military arm the court finds in vogue or traditional (the
navy being the English royal families tradition I believe).

Several issues.  You didn\'t include the mortgage payments (which
really penaltized slow ships), take advantage of increased cargo
space that you can get, look at making higher jump ships.  Also
one of the objections is that the kinds of cost given for drop
tanks just don\'t make sense.  A lot of this has been mentioned
so I won\'t repeat it.  I will
just point out that, in fact, you really don\'t need to drop
them at all.  As someone pointed out in an early "go round",
you can actually pull the thanks into the ship as they are
used and take them with you.

That would work if the Traveller background wasn\'t anything
more than a series of adventures.  But there is material that
purports to describe what a typical liner is like, what
cargo costs, whether military/scout vessels can jump in without
fuel, etc.

Maybe, I\'m not familiar with what you describe.  Even if it is, I
don\'t see having on mistake much of a reason to add more.

Exactly.  You can make a ship jump-6 without having to loose
60% of your space to fuel alone.  This is huge.

The point is, rather than wandering over the sector, they will only
be able to carry cargoes to worlds that get few ships.  This means
that you are stuck shuttling between those worlds and the main
routes.  As soon as you look to carry cargo along the main route
you find you can\'t compete.

Well, Far Trader makes this possible because you take spot cargoes
the big corps aren\'t interested in.  There problem here is that
you can\'t compete with drop tank tramp ships either.

It makes a difference.  It means that when I want to construct
a believable setting (or SJGs writes stuff for me) effort that
could go to other things has to go to making sure that all the
drop tanks are presented believably, that players choices
reflect the existance of them, etc.

Well, if you are imaginative there are things you can do about
this (like have tender ships that have tanks that can then
collapse down allowing them to become a small ship to jump
themselves).  That assumes you don\'t instead make tanks that
can callopse back into the war ship to bring itself.  (That is
part of the problem when you introduce a new technology assuming
you can see all the impacts, people are going to start having ideas).

Sure they might not be useful _every_ time, but they don\'t have
to be to have a big impact.  In the FFW they could have been used
to allow a huge fleet to jump from Allel to Jewel, attack anyone
they catch by surprise, and jump right out.  The fact is that
with drop tanks Jewel was not particularly cut off.

They may not
be much for commerce raiding and other fast moving sitatuations,
but they would have been great for launching major strikes in
something like the FFW.  After all, moving a bunch of drop
tankers 6 parsecs won\'t be slow compared to the time it takes
to take a world and reduce resistance.  Unless you are planning
on leaving enemy occupied worlds behind you....

The problem is that no corp is feeling effects.  They would change
the fundamentals of shipping be we are suppose to believe that
_none_ of the corps scored big or went bust???

>The Zhodani already has to protect all their territory.

And now instead of having to protect 6 parsecs deep against
ships that can jump in without fuel to refill, they have
to protect 6 parsecs deep agaisnt ships that can attack
with full tanks in case defenses are too big (and can
raid without fueling) and also protect _another_ 6 parsecs
deep against ships without fuel.

> Laying out deep
>space fuel depots is very expensive, but it is possible.

Yeah, very expensive and logistically difficult.  Enough so
that being able to do it easily will make it the sort of deep
raids the states would consider worth the effort every now and
then to be a routine tatic, something you can do with only
a fraction of the preparation that was need before.

This is sort of like saying that
having one side having jump-6 and another have jump-3 really
doesn\'t matter because you set up a refueling depot 3 parsecs out.
Drop tanks may require more logisitics than internal fuel
(and I\'m not sure it has to be that much), but
they do require a heck of a lot less than a fueling depot.

Ironically, on can use drop tanks _and_ deep space depots (drop
tanks make them a lot easier to set up and give you a much
bigger reach from them once you have set them up).  You
can reach further with less effort and that means that maybe
the Zhondai would have to worry about 24 parsecs behind their
lines.

You are missing the point.  You want to take a major world 4 parsecs
away.  But you can never know what is waiting there for you.  Now
most major ships have j-4.  Once you have gotten to within 4
parsecs, you can  either fight you way to within a parsecs of the
world and jump ships in with 1/2 tanks, you can try jumping
empty, or (with drop tanks) go ahead and just attack.

*THIS* one I\'ve got, and yeah, it\'s in my list:

#1  Rescue on Galetea

A rash of piracy and kidnappings, a mysterious Church for a patron, and a minor race in danger of extinction.  Never played it, but enjoy going through it for nuggets here & there.  CATN players *may* end up meeting people from the Church of the Future Man soon...  <grin>


#2 Sky Raiders Trilogy

A rilly *CLASSIC* minicampaign in the Foreven Sector.  This puppy set the standard that The Traveller Adventure book emulated.  All that\'s needed to make a complete full blown campaign are some random nuggets, a couple more firefights, a crash landing or 3, and a mysterious Widget of Immense Power...  <grin>

#3  (tie) Annic Nova or Twilight\'s Peak

Annic Nova is about the salvage and useage of an alien starship.  It\'s one of my LBBs that\'s come up missing over the years (and I gotta admit, Marc, when you published The Traveller Book and put \'Shadows\' in for a sample adventure instead of \'Annic Nova\', I was a bit dissappointed.  This is one of the LBBs that *WILL* be replaced someday!!!)

Twilight\'s Peak is a subsector-wide tresure hunt looking for a lost Ancients site in the Spinward Marches.  Following a book of *abysmal* poetry, the players retrace the final voyage of the Gyro Cadiz, lost in a previous Frontier War, uncover a Zhodani plot, and in general try to stay alive once they find the Ancients site.  This adventure is a good leadin to \'Secret of the Ancients\', although, IMTU, \'SOTA\' doesn\'t *quite* match up what was revealed in canon...  <grin>

Okay:

1) Sky Raider trilogy, Keith brothers, FASA.  

2) Twilight\'s Peak, Adventure #3, GDW

3) Ordeal on Eshaar (FASA) or Annic Nova (DA#1a).

I liked the Annic Nova, but never could figure out how to turn it into a
good adventure without making it too much like a dungeon crawl and yet not
lose the \'investigating eerie mystery\' flavor.  Anyone have any
suggestions/experience?  Given that, Ordeal on Eshaar probably wins as
written.  

Fourth runner up:  Nomads of the World-Ocean, GDW.

  I suspect that the point was that the fundamental technologies - jet
engines, metal airframes (which weren\'t necessarily an improvement over
wood early on, apparently) have only been refined and not revolutionized
since mid-century.

He doesn\'t.  He sits at his computer, does multivarient work
with differential equations in n-dimensional space with
transpostion of time and distance axis.  Gets out a bunch
of number and give them to the pilot.  The pilot takes the
numbers and feeds them into the the jump computer, taking
into account ship flight parameters.  He then looks important
and "pushes the big red button".

I\'m sure a Marine officer, at least, wears full dress uniform on his or
her wedding day.

What do bridal outfits in different cultures look like?  Some could be
more military than military.

In the Traveller universe, the same question could be reasonably asked
regarding a male officer, you know.  Of course, unless men change
dramatically in 3,000 years, the answer will be "full dress uniform",
not least because that way he doesn\'t have to make any actual wardrobe
choices -- it\'s all in the regs.

In no particular order:

AZ: Salvage on Sharmun, from Best of the Journal volume 1 (I think it\'s
in the first or second issue of JTAS).  This adventure involves an
Imperial starship full of money on the bottom of a lake on a red-zoned
world.  Sharmun is interdicted because the two major states in an
unstable equilibrium and any major dislocation might trigger all-out
nuclear war.  It felt much like the face-off between the United States
and the USSR in the 1950s and 1960s, but with Stalin still in power. 
There\'s the Young Pioneers camping near the lake; the mental hospital
(where I always assumed the crash survivors were); and other things that
gave the scenario flexibility and atmosphere.  

Speaking of atmosphere, I liked AZ: Thoughtwaves, in a later JTAS issue,
which took place in a pyramid underwater.  Imperial archaeologists are
investigating it when the Zhodanis arrive, which is the archaeologists\'
first notice that the Fifth Frontier War has started.  

Finally, the Great Wine Heist, run as a role-playing adventure but with
all of the crazy shoot-em up stuff aboard the AHL, is totally hilarious.

There is also the fact that the Solomani got to Bernard\'s star

I came onto the scene kind of late, so I never had many of the "legendary" licensed adventures 
(i.e.-  the "Sky Raiders" trilogy), but from the ones I have:

#1) Double Adventure 5: Chamax Plague/Horde.  The first part is, for my money, the best ever 
introductory Traveller scenario-- simple (rules-wise) and fun.  The  second part is a little 
more military than I prefer, but makes a great companion piece.

#2) The Traveller Adventure.  The first "real" (as opposed to one-off) Traveller adventure I 
ever ran, largely defined how I "look at" Traveller.

#3) Adventures 2 & 3: Research Station Gamma and Twilight\'s Peak.  RSG has got to be one of the 
least complete adventures ever published, which I actually like since it leaves lots of room for 
GM customizing.  TP is the original Epic Traveller adventure, and I don\'t think it\'s been 
matched since.

Later,

Trent

P.S.  This post marks my official return to the Traveller list after nearly two years\' absence 
(cruelly forced upon me when I inadvertently graduated college).  Last time I was here 
"Emperor\'s Arsenal" had just been released and the T4 future actually looked slightly rosy.  I\'m 
still trying to sort out everything that\'s occured since and would appreciate it if someone 
(presumably via private mail) could help me out with a few questions, including 1) what actually 
happened to IG (simple lack of sales or something more sinister)? 2)what\'s the deal with GURPS 
Traveller (I\'ve looked through a few of the books on store shelves but haven\'t bought any of 
them-- are they worthwhile, even if I don\'t own GURPS)? and 3) what\'s the story with T5-- when 
is it going to be published, by whom, and what will it be like (game system, era/setting, etc)?

I don\'t know if I\'ll be able to participate in this list as actively as I did in years past 
(since I now have to work for a living and have to rely on the generosity of my roommate for use 
of the computer) but it\'s still nice to be back.

Sort of. ;-> 

There are are a number of references in published works where ships
jump to an "empty hex", so I wouldn\'t argue that the OTU allows it.
However, IMTU, a ship has to lock onto a massive object (jovan or
larger) in order to perform a controlled jump.  I\'ve suggested that
some (perhaps many) "empty hexes" have such dark masses that just
aren\'t listed on maps...not being stars.  However, I don\'t have a
problem with folks just jumping to empty space if that\'s how they
want to play their games.

Seeing as you are new here, let me give you a heads up on a couple
of acronyms that are used a lot.  OTU stands for "Official Traveller
Universe" and refers to the published works detailing the Imperium.
IMTU stands for "In My Traveller Universe" and refers to the way
that poster plays Traveller, and that can differ from the OTU in
almost every way. ;->

Just what is and isn\'t OTU gets debated a lot, and can raise a lot
of heat.  The "drop tanks" debate is really about whether and how
that technology fits into the OTU, for example.  Other "done to
death" OTU topics that pop up occasionally and lead to long and loud
arguments are "piracy in the Imperium", "near c rocks" and anything
related to Virus. These are the "canon" debates. ;->

Then there are folks like me that enjoy the story of the OTU, but
*play* in our own TU\'s.  Many of us get labeled as "heretics" by the
"canonists."  Hey, we\'re the Rebel Alliance and *they* are the Evil
Imperium.  Personally, I embrace the light side. ;->

IAC, a lot of us post how *we* see things and how we reconcile OTU
references to our own TU\'s.  Even when we don\'t agree, and we often
don\'t, <g> we can pick up new ideas and enjoy each others
conversation.

Again, welcome aboard, and *please* share your ideas.

  FWIW, the HG stats of the X-boat in S:7 are only a conversion;

  In any case, as Hans has said many times before, the supposed prevalence
of J-4 commo is either some sort of sick joke or it required a genuinely
comprehensive suppression of private efforts to improve economic efficiency
in the Imperium - which SolSec would laugh itself silly over.

I agree that it was a *weird* way to do things. Best justification I
can come up with is that it\'s meant to mimic the not so great
astronomical gear aboard a ship, combined with difficulty of getting
accurate positions and lack of skill at making such observations.

But as a way of randomly selecting a hex out of a "hex of hexes" it\'s
rather nice.

Your right, slight oversight. Still comes down to the free trader not
benifiting from drop tanks.
Obviously, the far trader is the way to go, I was just exploring the option
for the free trader. To see if it could make the trip and still be
profitable. The conclusion, free traders are best jumping from world to
world and ignore trying to double-jump. Drop tanks just aren\'t profitable
for the free trader.

What do you think a drop tank should cost? I missed that conversation. Can
you point me towards a specific digest or summarize the final decided
cost(s)? I personnally think the price is cheap for drop tanks and actually
use that price as a rental fee.

What would be the point of having drop tanks if you could pull them in? If
you could pull them in, you wouldn\'t need them in the first place.

Of course, it all comes down to the almighty IMTU. Where in mine, instant
consumption and using the fuel throughout the jump are both possible, but
instant consumption increases the risk of misjump and wear on the drives.
This, of course, reduces the desire to use drop tanks. (not a happy
executive when he hears his MCr4344 OctaDropFreighter is "lost in space".)

I just picked the Free Trader as an example. Maybe it\'s just my TU, but Free
Traders(A), Far Traders(A2) and subsidized merchants(R) are a lot more
common than 8000 dton freighters.

I had to translate your ship into MT terms. Since that is what my message
was about.

I see your freighter having to charge Cr303/ton to pay for the drop tanks.

[I made a typo in my numbers in my original post (again, these numbers are
MT)]

>1kl of jump drive = 4 tons of cargo

should be 1kl of jump drive = 5 tons of cargo

>1kl of jump drive\'s worth of fuel in drop tanks = Cr5,000/kl (rounded for

>
>*reference [a free trader has 4kl of drives]
>
A far trader has 6kl of drives
A subsidized merchant has 8kl of drives

What I didn\'t think about, is the total cost of the drop tanks could be,
spread out over all the cargo.

The free trader needs to Cr452/ton to pay for the drop tanks
The far trader - Cr496/ton
The subsidized merchant - Cr209

The subsidized merchant (the best of the three) would make on Cr1,000/ton
profit:
Cr200,000
Cr190,000 w/drop tanks -- Cr240,000 - Cr50,000 (drop tanks)

It\'s not till Cr1,250/ton that this ship makes the same profit as it would
if it jumped w/out drop tanks

At Cr2,000/ton this ship makes Cr30,000 more w/ drop tanks (7.5% increase )

The Freighter (switched to MT) Cr1,000/ton
MCr6.45
MCr6.44 (w/drop tanks)

It\'s at Cr1,004/ton that this ship begins to make more w/drop tanks

At Cr2,000/ton this ship makes MCr2.79 more w/ drop tanks (21.6% increase)

I just don\'t see MCr4344 ships being abundent. If they are, I can see the
changes drop tanks would make.

The small increase in sales due to drop tanks isn\'t that much. But, I can
see it lead to (drop)tankers and other jump-gate possibilities.

IMTU, a ship can burn all its fuel at once and store it in capacitors for
the journey or it can burn the fuel throughout the trip. When a ship runs
the drives hot (consume all the fuel at once) then their is an increase in
risk of misjump and greater wear on the drives. The risks of misjump alone
is enough to keep people from using drop tanks and (drop)tankers/jump gates.

I have a female friend who is getting married this summer and is also in the

The Sky Raiders Trilogy

And "The Drenslaar Quest" by William H. Keith, Jr.

This last is the *only* decent published Traveller adventure
which requires underwater skills (SCUBA, diving, etc.) and
makes for a serious SEALs-type adventure while incorporating
pretty darn accurate rules for underwater salvage and deep-sea
diving in Traveller.

One thing about the Keith brothers\' publications - they pushed
the envelope in regards to environmental affects on a
Traveller adventure. They did some *excellent* research on
this aspect of the game. In fact, I\'d say it\'s on the level
of the research done for the various GURPS "real world"
supplements.

For those of you unfamiliar with their work, their game company
was called "GameLords, Ltd." If you ever have a chance to pick
up any of their environmental booklets for Traveller, do so. 
They\'re called "The Underwater Environment", "The Mountain 
Environment", and "The Desert Environment." These booklets
were written for CT but should easily convert to MT/TNE/T4.

A good point.  The Emperor is actually *too* powerful to achieve certain
goals: if he simply want\'s to guide or suggest a certain course of action,
he himself can\'t say it as Emperor, or it will be taken as orders.

And simply because Strephon SAYS that "it\'s just a suggestion" isn\'t
fooling anyone.  As one Roman philosopher said after losing an argument,
"I may have the better logic, but it\'s the Emperor who has the twelve
legions."

(Anyone has the exact quote?  I can\'t find it on the Web...).

Moreover, he would  have to contend with the endless flattery of the
courtier atitude ("Courtesan", a word decended from "female
courtier", also refers to a high-class prostitute).  As long as every
whim is law, he will continually have to filter the truth from the Yes-men
that always surrounds powerful people.

What\'s the use of suggesting something if every suggestion
always *appears* to be a resounding success, right up to the minute
the revolutionaries (aided by the Yes-men who just switched sides to
the new regime) burst into his bedchambers and shoot\'s him in his sleep?

So, if he want\'s to just nudge a man (or a society!) in the right direction,
the Emperor usually has to do it indirectly, through his wife and other
close family members, or through trusted nobles, intellectuals and aides.
( In certain varient Traveller Universes, the Imperial Catholic Church
would be usefull, as well...)

** High Archon **

A possible additional title that could belong to the Emperor
is High Archon, that is, "First among Equals" among
noble family Archons.  (An archon, BTW, is the head of
any given noble family).

As such, the Emperor or his representatives can mediate
between feuding or aggrivated noble families without
having to invoke Imperial power, keeping it in reserve
for problems that need it.  Also,  seperating the
powers of Emperor and High Archon allows the Emperor
to concentrate on economic/military affairs if he so
chooses, leaving the Hatfields and the McCoys
to others.  Of course, there are those Emperors
who *LIKE* sticking their fingers in dynastic
warfare: they can keep both titles of course.

** Alternate Universe  **

Aside: it\'s possible to create a varient Traveller
universe where the ruler would be actually
be the High Archon, *NOT* an Emperor.

In such a universe, the primary force
pre-Imperium would be the trading families,
keeping the arteries of commerse open during
the Long Night.  As the Night ended, the families
would eventually organize themselves into
Leagues and chains of obligation.  Finally,
a major charismatic figure, already the head of the
Sylean families, managed to get the Vilani families
to also unite under him, creating the office
of High Archon.

Which leads to the question: why did he never go
all the way, and have himself crowned Emperor,
like the First and Second Imperia?   Primarily,
because military and economic power was
never centralized in one man like Cleon Zhunastu:
the High Archons instead base their power on
diplomacy, excellent political skills, a reputation
for impeccable honesty (jealously guarded),
bloodline connections with all the major families,
and a sharp eye on bottom-line cost/benefit.

Note that the 1100 years of High Archon rule
would be fundamentally unstable, and more fluid and
eventful than the 1100 years of rule by an Emperor.
There would be more internal dissention and much more
subsector-level warfare between noble families for starters.
Warfare on the scale of the Rebellion would be impossible,
but on the other hand there would always be a few subsectors
or so in open revolt: few remain outside of the Imperium for
longer than a decade, as the benefits of trade are just so
great.  Tech level and cultural differences within a given region of
space would be much smaller, but differences between
regions would be greater and more noticeable.

It\'s umlikely that Core sector would reach the level of prominence
it has in the offical Traveller Universe: the Capital would have
shifted ocassionally to Vland, Terra, Dlan/Illeish, even the old
Second Imperium capital of Hub/Ershur.  The Imperium would be
fundamentally less centralised, with the High Archon *NOT*
ruling "The Space Between the Stars" but instead acting as
the final level of authority and law among noble merchant/military
families and the interstellar corporations that the nobility control.
Individual worlds simply would not matter to the Archon, except
as they interact with the Nobility.

Internal divisions would not be based on geometric, abstract
divisions of subsectors and sectors, but on the "sphere
of military power" of a given noble family. Massila sector may have
sixteen regular Dukes, but it\'s just as likely to have eight Dukes,
four Dukes, or even up to 20 Dukes.  It may not have *any*
Dukes, only ~50 interstellar Counts and Viscounts, with a weak
Senior Duke to represent them before the High Archon.

Observe that I\'m using Noble Titles to represent military power:
also note that the High Archon has *no* access to the military
title of Emperor, because

A) There isn\'t a military threat that can\'t be handled at the
level of Archduke.
B) Giving someone that much power is just asking for them to
turn on you, breaking your family\'s wealth and power and giving
it to himself under various guises and rationales. (from
"It\'s the Will of God" to "In the Name of the People" to  "It\'s
more Efficent" to "It\'s an Emergency").

Even the title of Archduke is rarely given.  Unlike Senior Duke
and below, it\'s only available in wartime, only for five-year
terms, and no noble family can have that title more than once.
The granting of that title is by the authority of the Domain moot,
but can be resinded by the High Archon.

Note that the High Archon, while never Emperor, is always a
Senior Duke and could be elected an Archduke for one five-year
term.

** Patronage **

An ancient innovation that could be useful
3000 years from now is the concept of Patronage.
In effect, in the same way that the Scouts may recieve
special favours from the Crown Princess (patron of the
IISS), other groups may have specific nobles and
noble groups to look out for their interests.  Bwaps
may look up to the their senior noble, Solomani may
have a representative in the Archduchess of Sol,
Vilani can have the Archduke of Vland to push for
more Vilani nobles, etc.

This has the possibility of binding the Imperium
together, by focusing politics on nobles, not
territories.  Then again, it\'s always possible that it could
be used as a power base to thwart the Emperor\'s Will,
so His Majesty will be carefully watching the major
patrons.

Wow, these all sound great.  And considering the fact that I never played or
reffed *any* of the published adventures, and own none of them, if any of
you feel like starting a Classic Trav Adventures PBEM, I\'m virgin fodder for
these.

HRH Prince Andrew was the chopper pilot in the Falklands conflict.
Evidently, he made quite an impression on some folks who had only seen him
as a playboy.

Great story about Elizabeth in WWII.  She had just finished her course in
engine maitenence, and announced that she was going to do a tune up of one
of the Royal Familiy\'s cars.  Spent serveral hours going over the engine,
then gathered everyone to show off her work.  Car wouldn\'t start.  Seems
her dad had swiped the distributor cap.

Second that.  There was also "Startown Liberty", which provided pretty good

An abstract Merchant adventure

1112-037 Regina/Regina:Spinward Marches

     Masahuru Kawamori took a look at the golden Michael Tukera
building one last time.  After 17 years of service (8 years at the
subsector headquarters at Nausicaa, Regina) his layoff came as an
unwelcome surprise: he snickered about "cutting off the deadwood",
but never considered himself as one of them till three hours ago.
Even so, he always was a careful man, and had enough credits to
keep himself and his two kids fed until he could find a new position.
With his experience in Tukera, Masahuru knew it would
take less than a month till a position with the right salary opened up
for him.

1112-090

     Finally, little Kenji was asleep.  Masahuru again went to his
Datasphere account, and wearily looked over the responses
to his posted business plan. Nothing.  None of the polite but
non-commental requests for more information, not even the
worthless infoad\'s, promising sure results "for a nominal sum".
Nothing at all.

     Years of work, years of planning, years of saving.
All for naught.

     Off went the holoscreen.  In three days, the bank will try
to deduct 300 credits from his account, but fail.  Then the
notices, first electronic, then hardcopy, then in person.
With his old employment record, he might convince them
to hold off for a month or two, but no more.  Like
most families in the Nausicaa-Brasil metropolitan region,
Masahuru school\'s his children at home with government
issued software, but Children\'s Affairs will soon come in to
physically check on their health.  If they decide that he can
no longer fill his parental responsibilities... well, he\'ll cross
that bridge when he get\'s there.

1112-096

     Masahuru\'s skin crawled as he entered the Song Hall.
The closest analogue to a bar or a party zone on this planet,
the Hall\'s was where everyone gathered for most social
occasions.  Huge screens projected it\'s flashing, spastic
imagery, from news to sports to soft porn.  The noise level
was deafening, so you couldn\'t hear yourself think: the
overused subsonic/phenomone "mood enhansers" didn\'t
help, as the wave\'s of synthetic emotions clashed with each
other.

     Oh, Master of the Stars, I\'d rather be playing Flashing Flares
with Nobu and Reni, Masahuru prayed silently.

     That\'s the spot, next to the completely incongruous formal
portrait of Emperor Strephon.  Pushing against the mass of
humaniti, Masahuru spotted some hard-eyed characters there,
three men which looked at the crowd like rave\'s
studying gheer herds. Knowing he\'s going to regret this,
Masahuru put on his "Happy to See You!" face and went up to
introduce himself.

**********************

     The PC\'s are part of a band of 5-10 old friends and
acquaintances.  Ex-Navy types, they are trying to make a second
career out of a microniche in the liner trade.  Specifically, they are
aware of vast number of Navy families who are scattered
across the sector, greatly separated from their serving men.  Typically,
when possible the Imperial Navy will give them vouchers to travel
to their husband\'s posting.

     Right now, the vet\'s are working out a deal with Naval Logistics,
putting out a tender for an Imperial contract to supplement the
major lines in this business.  The financial squeeze that Logistic\'s is
using is very, very tight, and so far there just doesn\'t seem to be a way
to make the number\'s work.  Moreover, the cost of
upgrading their ship, _The Wings of Honneanise_, to
Imperial Contract spec\'s continues to just eat the budget and
could scuttle the project all by itself.  Finally, NRVA, the
subsector-wide bank who has provided the venture capital, is
getting nervous and is insisting that new, updated
numbers be provided.

     To try to resolve these problems, the PC\'s have decided
to contact Masahuru.  They will provide a regular paycheck, but
in return they want his expertise to clean up the mess and get the
business moving.  Also, he is to provide \'advanced classes\' in
starship economics to these ex-warrior\'s: they have gotten this
far on their own (thanks to determination, contacts and common
sense), but need a boost to get a deep understanding
on the financial subtlety\'s of their business.

**********************

     I don\'t have a copy of Far Trader, so the Referee will have
to settle the important details on his own. Still, some points
can be made to guide this campaign:

* Upgrading costs: Shipyard costs will be a constant thing to
  watch out for.  How much of a deal can be made with the local
  shipyard?  How about shopping around for the right price?  As
  the PC\'s are experienced vet\'s, they can certainly do some of
  the work, but how much can they do, and how will this sweat
  equity be paid for?  What did the lawyer say about the
  contract?  And the local ShipMaster\'s Association: what do they
  recommend? Finally, are there any discount\'s for Government work?

  It\'s best if all this is negotiated, rather than dice-rolled.  If a little
  light violence is considered desirable, illegal societies are
  probably available to help out, but check out the interest rate (and the
  collection agency, run of course by guy\'s named Vito).  Also, the
  ex-Navy guy\'s could hire out their services for a run or
  two with local StarMerc\'s, but they will need to get this
  OK\'ed by NERV and the Imperial Navy\'s Logistic\'s office.
  It wouldn\'t do to run an Imperial Contractor as your day job, and
  a pirate group on the side....

  More peaceably, additional financing could be raised up with
  more partner\'s, but more partner\'s mean less control over the
  business, and NERV/Logistics may not like this.  If the money
  situation doesn\'t improve, NERV or the Imperial Government
  will press the PC\'s to sell more control to themselves, or even
  force them out of the business due to debt.  Afterward\'s, they
  could be hired on by NERV/the Imperium, and possibly
  forced out (Simply fired, or given an empty desk with an
  empty job to do).

* The Ship: _The Wings of Honneanise_ is meant to be a fairly
   large liner, in the 600 - 1000 disp ton range.  It is meant to be
   old and fairly cheap, but with jump 2-3 capasity.  Just as an
   example, we could use the Aramine-class liner as our stand-in
   (I\'m using BITS 101-ships document,  which you can get from
   their website www.bits.org.uk in the Archive section.
   The nice thing about 101-ships is that the document also holds
   the details of the ship\'s construction, allowing easy modification - for
a
   price).

  The 1200-disp ship is designed for a crew of 13, with 40 high
  passengers and 40 low passengers.  The hold is being shrunk,
  it\'s space being used for an additional 42 staterooms, another
  40 low berths and three special rooms: a parlor, a public
  kitchenette (so the passengers can cook their own family\'s food
  if so desired), and a rec room for the kids.  The high passenger
  space is being largely reclassified for middle passage, with three
  rooms being merged for the wives of flag-ranked officers, or other
  "Special needs" passengers.  Probably an additional steward or
  two will be hired.

  Currently, it\'s assumed that each middle-passenger will have two
  children under 13 in the same room, and the high-passage
  ticket will have a servant as well.  This requirement means
  that life support need\'s to be strengthened to handle the load,
  yet another cost.

* Imperial demands: The Imperial Contract\'s revenue initially slim,
  and will grow as the PC\'s prove themselves to IN Logistics.  IF
  the PC\'s get modification cost\'s under control or otherwise
  manages to get it paid without too much debt, then the PC\'s
  are good to go.  If the referee decides that the PC\'s didn\'t get
  the cost\'s contained, then the only option short of giving up is
  to get the Imperium to cough up more credits per run.
  Some options:

     - Get paid an additional retainer for on-call grey/black
operation support
     -  Same as above, but for emergency troop transport
     - Be able to sell unused tickets to the general public
     - Occasionally rent out the ship for a month or two for charter
operations
     - Get paid by the jump, rather than by the ticket
     - Get paid more per ticket (this is most difficult)
     - Get paid for a full passenger load, regardless if the passenger list
is full or not (this ain\'t easy, either!) .
     - Get the ship repaired for free (or at a low, low cost) at Imperial
Navy facilities, at least to start out

Negotiating all this will take time.  The PC\'s will probably have to
separate, some to continually supervise the upgrade of
_The Wings of Honneanise_ on Regina and insure that they aren\'t
being cheated, and the other to Mora, capital of the
sector (as well as the entire Domain of Deneb) to personally jump
through the hoops and get some face time with the Naval Officer
in charge of this project. Just the transport to and from Mora can take
one-to-two months.

Also, someone can go to NERV headquarters at nearby Allel
(Regina:Spinward Marches 1706 B46789C-A) to try to ease the
terms of the loan: this is rather unlikely according to their loan manager,
however.  The world is quite pleasant for a low-G world, but the law
level is intrusive and highly bureaucratic (more Japanese-style
ultra-polite, "Yes Means Maybe" bureaucracy than "This is the
Way We ALWAYS Do It!" Vilani-style red tape).
The astute visitor may notice rare glimpses of apparent
\'mysticism\' in NERV: investigating further, while probably quite
interesting, is outside of this document and will have to be left to
the discretion of the referee.

[Hint to referee: consider the company\'s motto:
"GOD\'S IN HIS HEAVEN. ALL\'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD".
Don\'t be trite: What is it that NERV is *really* driving at? ]

* Running the Liner

So all the money is squared away, the licences have been
secured, and the _Wings of Honneanise_ is ready to lift.
After the teething problems, certain things tend to stand
out with operating this ship, in comparison to other liners

  - Lot\'s of women and small kids.  The wives tend to
be somewhat conservative, and they may pump the
ex-Navy crew for info about their husbands, Navy rumours,
or anything else that come to their minds.  Someof these
women were raised in a Navy family: more clued in than
their sisters, they often know what to ask, and what
not to ask.  It\'s possible that they have had a prior
connection with the PC\'s and may ask for a
favour or even be in a position to GIVE a favour.

The Imperial Navy is an intensely political organization,
and is the fundamental basis of political power in the
Third Imperium.  Because of this, the PC\'s will have to
"forget they heard" certain information, and sometimes
be extremely careful in what they say: you never know
who\'s listening.


Taking care of the kids will be a priority: superior
childcare one of the major reason\'s why the families
is using _Wings of Honneanise_  instead of, say,
Oberlindes Lines for their transportation.  Much of this
will be left to the stewards, but the grizzled ex-Navy
PC\'s will occasionally have to deal with it.
Be nice, folks: mommy is watching.

  - Upon occasion, the ship will be drafted to withdraw
Navy and Noble families from certain hostile regions.
The PC\'s might get the Navy to provide a bit of covering
fire if needed, but most of the time they will be
expected to handle the situation themselves.
This will be rare event.

  - Romantic involvements with the passengers is
best avoided: dueling is a tradition within the Navy,
and there are some people you don\'t want to make mad.

  - Because of the PC\'s semi-offical status, they may
be tempted to do a little smuggling on the side.
Forget it: this isn\'t a free trader, and it\'s WAYYY to easy
for the Imperium to track your patterns, and root you out.

  - If the PC\'s get a good reputation going and start running
a solid profit, then after about two years NERV and/or IN
Logistics office will ask the PC\'s to expand their operation
to two ships.  This would be a good time to renegotiate
profit-sharing, taking the company public, buying out either
NERV or the IN\'s share, etc.  The IN will want to reduce
or eliminate their subsidies, and may ease up on their
"on-call" rights to the PC\'s ship.  NERV will want the
business to grow, extend the credit line, retire/rollover
old debt and basically rake in more money.


(Despite NERV\'s vague religious aura, it\'s a business,
not a charity, and behaves like a business.... mostly)

  - And what about Masahuru Kawamori?  He\'ll probably
be a senior employee by this time, and possibly remarried.
As a father, he may provide a few pointers in running the
ship that typically childless PC\'s would miss.  It\'s possible
that, if he really provides good value for his time, he\'ll want
to have a share in the company and the company\'s
profits.  Besides the Referee\'s unofficial advisor to
the players, he may or may not be feeding info to his
old employer: even so, it\'s unlikely that Tukera Lines will
want to horn in such a tiny business niche:
it\'s too expensive to operate in for the limited profits available.


* Navy Culture

As the PC\'s are ex-Navy, they will tend to react to live in
the Navy Way, in contrast to the local culture of the
Merchants and Traders.  Exactly how Navy and Merchant
culture clashes occurs depends on the Referee: some guesses
and stereotypes include:
   ex-Navy vet\'s may focus on lines of authority and rank,
in comparason to Merchant spacers
   Merchant focus on cheapness, rather than quality
   Merchant avoidance of the Regs, while Navy-raised spacers
accepts and enforces them
   Merchants tend look on the Navy as adversaries (unless
the pirates or warfare is occuring)

   The ex-Navy types may be more likely to fink on Merchant
illegal activities, as their symphathy is for the Patrol Cutter,
not the grey-market Free Traders.
   The ex-Navy types may be given more margin by Navy
personnel (they may know each other personally, or
"a friend of a friend".
   The ex-Navy guys and Merchants have access to two different
rumour gravevines.

*  Long term

    It\'s most likely that the PC\'s will never expand past
Regina subsector boundaries: the market for transporting
Navy families is quite limited, and is usually folded in
standard liner operations.  Of course, there will be
occasional runs to Mora, and possibly - if the PC\'s
get a sterling record for service and discretion - even
a run to Capital with the families of Flag-level officers.


The campagn need never expand past this level:
there\'s more than enough excitement in a single
subsector for the creative referee to keep the PC\'s
hopping for as long as they play Traveller.  If the PC\'s
do get bored, have them sell off their Contract and
the ship, use the funds for a brand-new venture.

Also quite likely is failure.  IF so, then the PC\'s
are out on the street again.  They may have made
several new contacts, and quite possibly sone new
enemies also.  They may have been driven
to bankruptcy, which has it\'s own adventuring possibilities.

Most unlikely, but not outside the realm of reality, is the PC\'s
becoming wildly successful.  The demand for transportation of
Imperial-service families grows as a distinct part of the liner
industry, and the PC\'s start running their own specialized
subsector line.  Demand grows to include Imperial Army,
Imperial Marine, and even some Imperial Civil Service families.
Hiring the right people and getting better ship\'s becomes
a priority:and with an expansion of operations is a greater
need for quality control.  The young company strains to
keep up with demand as it grows past subsector borders,
encompassing the Spinward Marches and possibly the entire Domain.


Infrastructure demands - the need for more berths, or
even a company-owned starport on certain worlds -
start taking the PC\'s away from their ship.  Local planetary
politicians and low-ranking nobles begin to "just drop by",
trying to get their worlds on the PC\'s route (regardless if it\'s
possible, or even desireable).  Vendor\'s start bothering the
PC\'s, promising everything from toys to stardrive repairs
"at prices you can afford".  Moreover, pressure to "flex the rules"
appear\'s from criminal organizations, or substantial bribes and
kick-backs ("around here,  you get either the gold or the lead...")

Labour starts to act up, asking for more salaries, an easier
operations tempo, and more time with their families: they may
unionise.  At least one scandal erupts, which the PC\'s will have
to resolve while conducting operatons.  And here comes the press,
asking all sorts of questions about this company that came from
nowhere.  Did I mention the Imperial Revenue cutter that just arrived
from Mora?  It seems that there have been certain anonymous
allegations of tax evation: we\'re sure that everything is
above board, and since you have nothing to hide, you will
be more than happy to open your books for an Imperial Audit....

Meantime, a ton of copycat lines spring up, and the big boys (including
Tukera Lines and it\'s affiliates) start showing up to grab your lunch.
Besides the usual dirty tricks that will keep the PC\'s lawyers busy for
years, evidence grows that there is a high-level leak in the PC\'s business:
is Masahuru Kawamori, the ex-Tukera man,  the traitor?  Or is it
someone else?

As the possibility of a Corporate War grows, the PC\'s will need to call
in their old Navy buddies as they gear up.  The Navy itself get\'s
real pissed when attacks are made against ship\'s carrying Navy and
Marine families, while competing companies start a) insisting how
innocent they are b) how the PC\'s alone are at fault - see how slack their
security is c) see how perfectly clean the competitor\'s record is.

    This entire situation can turn real, real ugly.


    Especially if the Navy start doing reprisals, in kind.



    And assuming the PC\'s actually survive Armageddon?


They will need to rebuild from their losses, regain the favour of
Imperial Logistics, and figure out "what now?".  This depends on
how badly things turned out: they might all be in small sub-atomic
particles, or in prison awaiting execution, or hiding out in Zhodani
space.

Also possible is that a deal was somehow worked out that averted/
ended the Corporate War.  The Imperium would be most pleased if no
harm fell on the military families, and grow in anger the more
pain and suffering fell on those wives and kids. Note that the security
of those people is far more important to the Imperium (especially
the Imperial Navy ) than any financial or personnel losses the PC\'s
may suffer.

[Aside: one of the reasons for the Contract in the first place was
the IN\'s trust in fellow ex-Navy vet\'s to take care of their families,
rather than some money-grubbing MegaCorp out for the fastest
credit.  Breaking that trust will have Regrettable Consequeces.]

Well, even if by extraordinary hard work, outrageous luck and
unflinching courage against Real Bad Odds they get to the
Domain-level of businesses, they will still need to expand their
business niche from transporting the families of Imperial servants
if they want to compete head-to-head against Tukera Lines, rather
then remaining within a niche market.

This probably will NOT be allowed by the Archduke, unless the PC\'s are
really, really serious, with big-time financing, major noble support
(meaning
several ruling nobles at the major world/subsector level with at least
one Sector Duke on their side), and substantial evidence that their
business will provide major benefits to the Imperium, as a whole.

At this level, the PC\'s aren\'t really in it for the money anymore,
except as a way to keep score.  They can just as easily work out a \'mutually
beneficial deal\' with Tukera Lines, selling the company to Tukera at
a very nice price, becoming a independent subsidiary, linked by
cross-owned shares, or by simply remaining in their niche, leaving most
of the pie to Tukera while protecting their turf with low contract prices,
high service, and a system of mutual favours with the Navy.

If the PC\'s decide that they really want to build a genuine, for real
MegaCorporation across the entire Imperium, well, my imagination stalls
at this point, so I will give the floor to others.  I\'ll only note that
timespan needed is probably in the two century plus range,
assuming everything works out (a near impossibility).
Relationships with the other MegaCorporations need to be worked
out, as well as relations with the Nobility, the Emperor/Emperess,
and the Navy.  The culture of the MegaCorp also need\'s to be built
(expect heavy Navy influence).  Finally, the PC\'s will have to decide
who will be their major shareholders:  it will prove impossible to avoid
selling ownership to at least some senior nobles (they\'ll expect
good prices!):  the Imperial family, and any allied MegaCorporations
will look kindly on you if you sell them a cut, too.

(PS: This adventure was inspired by Federal Express, founded
and staffed in the early years by ex-US Air Force personnel.  Call it
a "sector-level" corporation....)

A follow up to the Annic Nova bit: Do any later supplements ever describe
in further detail  the origins of this vessel?

As for favorite adventures:

1) Memory Alpha (That\'s the one that comes with the T4 GM\'s screen)

2) Annic Nova

3) Most of the stuff in "Missions of State" (T4)

Probably. But you also have to note that while that *is* a "peak" in

1. Lords of Thunder in MTJ #4
One of the best adventures of any RPG, in my opinion. An epic campaign in
an Imperial client state combining trade, mercenaries, espionage, piracy,
scientific research, exploration, alien civilizations, one huge fleet
battle, and the revelation of a Traveller Secret. This is the only
Traveller adventure I have seen that makes pirates believable, and the only
one that reveals a Secret which isn\'t implausibly contrived to draw the
player characters into it. It would be a great adventure even if the
players only sat back and watched news reports, but they can do far better
for themselves by rushing into the thick of things.

2. Fifth Frontier War by GDW
Yeah I know this is a board game, but the best adventure I ever played used
the turns of this game as the back story. It\'s hard enough trying to
courier messages for the Baron without huge Sword World fleets jumping in
to ruin your day.

3. Twilight\'s Peak by GDW
The canonical Traveller adventure. The players try to track down a lost
scout shipment while hints of war swirl around them. Don\'t make the mistake
of rushing to the conclusion too quickly.

That could just be that you haven\'t found any good 8000 dton freighter
designs.  Sensing a possible market, AuricTech Shipyards will provide a
(T4 FF&Sv2) design "on spec."  I should have a design roughed out in the
next few hours.  Base parameters are for performance equal to a
Subsidized Liner (Type M):  Jump-3 and 1G acceleration.  I\'ll probably
streamline it for landings/frontier refueling, though.  We\'ll see.

And no, this ship will _not_ be fitted (in its orginal configuration)
for drop tanks.

I did something similar with "Imperium."  As this was before the
Solomani Rim supplement came out, I generated world stats using Book 3.

Sure, but that material is far from comprehensive. So far you haven\'t come
up with any canonical facts that prove that drop tanks do not exist.

My point is that not mentioning the avalar Consulate (it\'s in Foreven Sector,
mentioned in _Imperiallines #1_) wasn\'t a mistake, since GDW simply didn\'t
have the space to mention it earlier than they did. Since 99.9999-and-I-
don\'t know-how-many-more-digits % of the information about the Traveller
Universe has not been written yet, I don\'t think it is wise to argue that
the failure to mention something is proof that it dosen\'t exist. I\'ll grant
you that it\'s evidence to that effect, but hardly proof.

Correction: To and from worlds that are not linked by drop tank service.
Drop tank service will be between pairs of worlds with a lot of trade. It
won\'t be between worlds with lots of ships and worlds with few.

Drop tank tramp ships? My guess is that drop tank service and tramp ships
will be incompatible. How do you figure otherwise?

This applies equally to a host of other issues that are usually similarily
glossed over. You\'re not writing an economic dissertation about drop tanks,
you are running a game. Just make up something that sounds reasonable.
Shouldn\'t take you more than a few minutes.

Better yet, persuade someone to write a sourcebook where the problem is
thoroughly explored and proper rules for dealing with it presented.

>Well, if you are imaginative there are things you can do about this (like

This is illegal by CT rules.

It\'s also a problem when you start out with a technology without exploring
all the ramifications. Drop tanks miss being a start-up technology for
Traveller by a short whisker; it\'s been CT since _High Guard_.

However, that particular ramification is also illegal by CT rules. You can\'t
make collapsible drop tanks. Guess that must be a relief to you, right ;-)?

This is coming down to another of those faith things. I don\'t deny that
drop tanks will affect naval strategy, and I don\'t claim that I can prove
just how big or little it will be. But neither can you prove that they
will make so big a difference as you claim. I can tell you that if you
want to use them all over the place, then the cost mounts up, even with
_High Guard_ prices. If you use G:T prices they will definitely become a
budget issue.

Sure, if they had been available in the sizes and configurations needed to
make it work. Now, do you really think that it is implausible to the point
of rejection that the Zhodani did not have enough drop tanks available to
do so? I sure don\'t.

This is simply a bunch of unproven assumptions. You may or may not be right
or partly right, but you really have no way of knowing for sure. We don\'t
even know if the Zhodani have drop tank technology yet, or if they\'ve had
it long enough to build drop tanks in sizable numbers.

You don\'t know that, because we have no information about that.

We don\'t know who scored big and who went bust. All we know is the names of
13 megacorporations and a handful of smaller outfits that didn\'t go bust.

You didn\'t understand what I wrote. They already have to defend ALL their
territory, all the way back to Zhdant. Not just 6 or 12 parsecs deep from
their borders, but ALL their territory.

I think you are exaggerating the effect, but it really dosen\'t matter,
because you can\'t prove that this very change in tactical doctrine is not
taking place.

No, you are. I never said drop tanks wouldn\'t affect naval doctrine. In
fact, I said it would. We disagree about just how much (and I don\'t mind
admitting that your guess is as good as mine (well, almost ;-)), but that
really isn\'t relevant, because there\'s nothing in the canon to say that
these changes aren\'t taking place somewhere off stage.

My PC\'s tend to wear skinsuits (GURPS:UT26) while in normal space, and
coverall/short sets while in jumpspace.  Planetside, on a standard
oxygen-nitrogen world Monocrys lined coveralls are typical, unless special
environmental clothing is needed.  Some wear Ablative/heavy monocrys vests

I read some opinions about allowing high-powered weapons
to fall into players\' hands, and I guess I have to shove my oar
in.

If you don\'t know how to referee high-powered weapons,
then you need to learn.  I don\'t know how to referee them.
They can\'t be treated as just a bigger gun (a.k.a. Quake
and Doom), because they can upset the game balance.
Also, some universe credibility might be at stake: why does
the world suddenly get meaner when the group gets Fusion
Guns?

The feeling of Godhood from owning a PGMP-13 should be
tempered with some rules... maybe we should treat these
energy weapons more like starships, with a dozen little modules
that need regular care + maintenance... at a cost, of course.
Like, just for instance, a plasma gun has:

1. armor mount clamps and interface-logic circuits
2. power supply, with regulators and "capacitors".
3. a plasma chamber where the fun begins
4. a focusing element
5. perhaps a magnetic impeller, projector, or emitter
6. all kinds of shielding

You got a gun?  Okay, each time you use it you are
contributing to its wear and tear.  High-tech parts cost
credits, and the higher the tech, the more complex the
care needed.  You can\'t clean the barrel of a fusion gun
with a bit of cloth diaper attached to a steel rod... you
may end up killing yourself if you do.

Can you say maintenance points?

And Another Thing.  These guns are Imperial Military only;
civilians can\'t buy them, can\'t own them, can\'t be seen with
them.  One would assume they are lent out to complete a
mission, after which they are repossessed.

Perhaps... just perhaps... there are components that need
regular conditioning, at exorbitant prices -- once a month
or after every use.  To prevent "leaking".  How\'s that
sound?

	The biggest (and fatal) problem with this (from a "canon" POV) is
that it requires that you jump *with* the tank ... and hence your
displacement includes the jump tanks, and hence you are limited to
your jump capability at the higher volume.

	The key feature of jump tanks, and what makes them both useful and
such a pain, is that they are dumped *before* jump ... hence your
ship\'s displacement is smaller, and the jump drive can throw you
further. It\'s precisely this feature that causes such firefights over
how "jump fuel" is used. It implies that all of the fuel in the tanks
is used in a very short time ... but not to generate energy that
could be used for anything else.

	Because a fusion gun draws more attention than something else. Test
this out in Real Life: have a hundred people walk down any major
city\'s streets with concealed weapons. Do nothing illegal to draw
attention to yourself. Note how many have law enforcement encounters.
Next day, send those hundred people walking down the same city\'s
streets, carrying a shotgun. Note how many have encounters, and the
level of those encounters.

	If you\'re running around with fusion guns, of COURSE the authorities
(and the bad guys, and the uninvolved-but-armed bystanders) are going
to react with more force, on average, than if you\'re carrying body
pistols.

readiness to join the Imperium by its annual trade with
the Imperium (with respect to political maneuverings, of
course).

Here\'s what they say: a world is ready to become a
"stable part of the inner community" (read: fully
priveleged member world of the Imperium) when its
trade "approaches or exceeds millions of tons per year".
1,000,000 tons per year is, roughly, 20,000 tons per
week.

Is this what the average Imperial world trades with
the Imperium per year?  Tentatively, I\'d say this
corresponds to Imperial worlds on the X-Boat route
mainly, though I could be wrong... am I?

Going back to my old saw, the Spinward Marches,
I can see Regina, Rhylanor, Mora, etc plowing tens
of thousands of tons of cargo per week; however, I
can\'t see it on Tureded or Treece, or even Fulacin
or Inthe.

In fact, here are the worlds my rules-o-thumb would
point to as 20,000+ tons-per-week worlds in the Marches.
As you may see, the central worlds have the benefit of
more trade, which results in inflated numbers.  This may
be plausible, but may not be desirable and therefore may
need to be taken with a grain of salt.

	Ahh, there\'s the rub, they ain\'t.    Local army units can also 
possess high powered weaponry, and it\'s up to the local government to 
determine what its "army" consists of,   high powered hand weapons might be 
more prevalent than you might at first think.  
	 But, in any case, I\'ve never let my players get their hands on high 
energy weapons except for one PGMP-12, which didn\'t unbalance things too 
much, since it isn\'t all that much more powerful than an autocannon or other 
light vehicle weapon.  Likewise, even though my campaigns usualluy evolve 
into mercenary campaigns, usually the unit is a light infantry unit in 
cloth/flex carrying ACR type weapons.   I keep the PCMP\'s and battledress to 
a minimum.  But when they did get one, I let them use it!
	In a similar vein,  once a player privateer/merc group got their own 
grav tech with plasma cannon.   And yes, the oppositiojn got tougher, because 
the players could take more dangerous tickets.

Seems to me that it\'s better to conquer a world
politically than militarily -- Lao Tzu knew that
thousands of years ago (better to win a war
without fighting).  The Milieu Zero hardcover
book has lots of great detail about this.

Doesn\'t this change the nature of interstellar
warfare, then, to more economic than military?
Doesn\'t the military come in under planetary
warfare rather than interstellar warfare?

How can you possibly establish a beachhead
on a hostile world, unless they are four or five
TLs under you?  And in that case, how can
you expect to hold the world usefully?

Take control of the System

Take control of the planentary Orbit
	This includes beating down stuff like Deep Meson Sites

Orbital bombardment of Military installations

Take control of the planetary skies

- ---- Tactic One ----
Demand Planetary surrender

	Orbital Bombardment of select population centers if they
	don\'t surrender

	Demand Planetary surrender

	Repeat last two steps if necessary

Land Troops
- ---- End Tactic One ----

- ---- Tactic Two ----
Sub-Orbital insertion of troops at key areas

Troops sieze control of key areas

Demand Planetary surrender
- ---- End Tactic Two ----


The key thing is that you\'ll need a LOT of troops to pull off either of
these, especially the second one.  If they are about the same TL, I\'d guess
at least
1,000,000-10,000,000 troops.

I\'m not really familiar with traveller versions of a lot of the ships that
would be required for such a venture.  In published material at least there
is a definite lack of such vessels.

assuming you want the biosphere intact, it takes a great deal of effort.

For the purposes of this arguement, let\'s say that orbital control has
laready been established, the fleet needs to move on within a fixed, fairly
short period, and the locals control resources you want intact.  They
refuse to surrender.

The key is to identify nexii that you need to control the world.
Communications and transportation hubs are the key.  If your troops control
the movement of food and information, the vast majority of the population
is likely to accept the new order.

The actual invasion is going to be bloody.  This is why Marines have
nigh-invulvernable battledress.  Their job is to carve out a safe landing
zone for the heavy army units following them.

	The MT or TNE scope of skills seems about right to me, with a few
	exceptions.  In all versions of Traveller, the skills associated
	with Doctors, Engineers and Stewards have been too broad, IMO.

	Breaking Medical, Engineering and Steward into four or five skills
	adds a chance for a little specialization without going to the
	extreme of a skill for *every* activity.

	I think it might make sense to have a broad skill that serves as a
	primary with specializations clustered under it.  For quick task
	resolution and in a lot of general play you\'d just use the general
	or primary skill, but you\'d also have the specializations for the
	situations where you might want to use them. 

	Take the Medical skill, for example.  

	  Medical
	    Diagnosis
	    Physician
	    Medical Electronics
	    Trauma Care
	    Surgery    

	Now, I know Biology, Chemistry, Genetics, Psychology and probably
	several other skills are important for Medic/Doctor type characters,
	but just for now let\'s work with this group.

	Somehow, and I\'m not entirely clear in my head how to work this <g>,
	you would get a Medical skill which would be used for general
	medicine tasks, but also gives *some* sort of specialization.
	Maybe, it would work to assign two or three points to the
	specializations of the players choice, with the proviso that no
	specialization can exceed the general skill?

	Example:

	To become a licensed MD Joe has to get a have at least a 1 in all
	the specializations.  He wants to specialize in Surgery, so he\'ll
	concentrate there as best he can.

	Joe completes Medical School receiving, among other things a
	Medical-3, and 6 or 9 specializations. He distributes them.

	  with 2 to 1                   with 3 to 1

	  Medical-3                     Medical-3               
	    Diagnosis-1                   Diagnosis-2           
	    Physician-1                   Physician-1           
	    Medical Electronics-1         Medical Electronics-1 
	    Trauma Care-1                 Trauma Care-2         
	    Surgery-2                     Surgery-3             

	During his first term after Medical School, Joe works mainly in an
	Emergency Room.  He gets another Medical skill and puts
	specializations into Trauma Care, but he finds a way to continue
	working on his Surgical specialty as well.

	  Medical-4                     Medical-4               
	    Diagnosis-1                   Diagnosis-2           
	    Physician-1                   Physician-1           
	    Medical Electronics-1         Medical Electronics-1 
	    Trauma Care-2                 Trauma Care-4         
	    Surgery-3                     Surgery-4             

	During Joe\'s next term he continues his work in the hospital,
	receiving another Medical.  He was working as a general surgeon, so
	he can add to his Surgical skill, but he also works on his Diagnosis
	and Physician skills.
	 
	  Medical-5                     Medical-5               
	    Diagnosis-2                   Diagnosis-3           
	    Physician-1                   Physician-2           
	    Medical Electronics-1         Medical Electronics-1 
	    Trauma Care-2                 Trauma Care-4         
	    Surgery-4                     Surgery-5             

	Geeze, this might work!  That 3 to 1 looks pretty good.  What do you
	think?
	
	I like it!, it helps those that wish to specialize do so and those
who wish to generalize to so as well. The beauty is you could apply it to
most skills and, in terms of graduate education, mimics what happens in real
life; i.e. specialization in particular aspects of a field of knowledge: 

	For example, a P.h.D in history would almost certainly be focussed
on a specific period & issue and specialization would help bare this out.

	E.g. A doctorate focussing on Imperial Colonization, say two levels
of history, could be broke into:

- -	Imperiumx2
- -	Colonizationx3
- -	Long Nightx1

A problem I can see is where do you draw the line of compartmentalization.
For example with History, into one hundred year blocks? five hundred year
blocks? thousand year blocks? specific worlds or interstellar governments?

Maybe the more specialized an aspect of a skill is, the task difficulty gets
lowered correspondingly. E.g. Streetwise focussed on a specific world is
reduced by two difficulty levels as the specialization can only be used on
that world.

And should the base skill still play a part? For example, a Historian
analyzing a new period of History (i.e. does not have a specialization) with
a base skill of 3 would be able to draw more accurate conclusions that
someone with a base skill of 1.

How would any of this affect DMs?

What does the Grand Princess of the Imperium Ciencia Iphegenia do with her
time? It says in G:T that she is a staunch supporter of the IISS. At 30 (in
2118) she is still unmarried. In 1121 she is to visit the Spinward Marches.
Norris Aella Aledon, the Archduke of Deneb is also unmarried. He was leading
the Imperial forces against the Zhodani in 1108 in the Fifth Frontier War,
when she was twenty. He must have been to core at some time during that
year, to procure the Imperial Warrant that allowed him to turn the war
around. Could the Grand Princess have been responsible for that? After all
Norris was just another sector duke, with no military command experience.
why would the Emperor trust him with such an important task?

I see a very convoluted campaign coming on.

True.  But I tend to use PP as a resource rather than an adventure.  Hmmmmmmmmmmm...  I wonder if my players would like a nice one-way ticket to Coventry...

Both Charles and Andrew were commissioned RN Helo pilots, Edward
enlisted in the Royal Marines but flunked out in basic training. The "tradition"
for British Royals to become career military is a fairly recent thing, dating
from after the 1st WW. Prior to that royals do basic training (in one of the
more fashionable Army regiments), maybe serve a year or two and then
move on to a career as a Noble.

ObTrav: I keep on expecting Prince Lucan\'s acceptance to the Imperial Marine
Academy to appear in a TNS.

According to pre-GURPS Traveller publications, no.  He didn\'t leave the
Spinward Marches at all (if he had, he would have had to have left when
the war broke out and could only have got back by the time it ended, and
so missed the whole thing).  Rather, the Imperial Warrant was retrieved
from a derelict \'battlecruiser\' in the Shionthy belt (Regina s.s.).

Both Templars.

Or, more likely if you ask _me_, they\'re -- you know -- _special friends_.

    'topic' => 'Bludgeoning the Technically Terminated Equestrian -- Broken Freight Rates Revisited (CT/HG)...',
    'body' => '        A couple of months ago, Ian Whitechurch (Hi, Ian!) and I hammered
out a reasonable cargo rate structure base on "RealWorld(tm)" cargo rates,
etc.  The results worked out, after a few hull design tests, to be the
following formula:
                        Freight Cost Per Ton = (Cr500 + Cr500/jp to carry)

        So, a cargo going a distance of 2 parsecs was worth Cr500 + 2*Cr500
= Cr1500.  This in turn resulted in a well-tuned design making an average
Rate of Return Per Anum of 3%-5%....  That is of course, for a *perfect*
year;  full holds and no battle damage.

        Well, I discovered today, while checking the numbers on most of my
TNEC frieghters, that *none* of them can make any money.  They all run
RORPAs of -1% to -3% on a perfect year.  This is Bad.  The problem, I
discovered, was the TL...  The powerplant tonnages and costs at TL9 are much
higher than at TL15.  So the formula was broken for anything but TL15.
Since my TNEC game is average TL *9* with maximum technical UN at *11*,
pro-rating ship costs based on Striker didn\'t work...  those tables are
written, as far as I can see, relative to a TL 15 game milieu.

        So, I went back and designed by HG the venerable Type-A, as per "The
Traveller Book" under High Guard.  At TL 9, it lost money, at TL15 (to my
surprise) it almost lost money.  As in, "one empty cargo run the whole year
and you are pooched" almost.

        Based on the idea that the Type-A seems to be the most populous
canon passenger-frieghter, it would only exist if the design actually made
money.  This is a presumtion on my part, I know....

        So, I worked out what multiplier was required to make a Type-A fit
the 3%-5% RORPA recipe for success.  I then redid the Type-A as a TL9
(which, BTW, almost matches the stats in the CT Book perfectly) and figured
it out again.  Came up with a bigger mutliplier, and then did a linear
extrapolation of the TL\'s in between.

        So, the revised formula looks like:

        Freight Cost Per Ton = (Cr500 x TLM + Cr500 x parsec dist to carry)
        
        ...where the Tech Level Multiplier (TLM) comes from:
                TL	Multiplier
                9	4.0
                10	3.8
                11	3.7
                12	3.5
                13	3.3
                14	3.2
                15	3.0

        The TLM is there to reflect a market economy of lower TLs.  This is
to reflect the higher transportation charges, construction costs and the
like that seem to make it much more expensive to use interstellar transport
at lower tech levels.  
        Note that the reference marker is for the milieu\'s *maximum*
technical level...  so for the 3I, you use a *3* and for my TNEC milieu you
use a 3.7.  The result is that ships built with the newest tech make more
money than older tech ships at any TL.  My test case, the Beowulf, hits
between 4% and 5% RORPA at TLs 9-15 on a perfect year.
        When I apply this to my TNEC ships, the older TL9 designs slip
towards 2%-3% RORPAs and the shiney new TL 11 Mirage/HAVAST-class 650dton
Mechant Cruiser I am working on rings in with a RORPA of 5.3%.

        Now, for MTU, I will actually reduce the TLMs by 1pt as I also have
a "Area Risk Multiplier" that I will add to it to account for the region the
ship is operating in....  ARMs in TNEC look like:

        Area                    Area Risk Mult          Notes
        Core Worlds             1x                      UN Navy everywhere,
well defended starports, highest-pop worlds and non-existant piracy
        Established             1.5x                    Similar to Core,
with lighter Naval presence, and rare incidences of piracy/ privateering
        Frontier                        2x                      UN Navy is

privateering
        Beyond Frontier         2.5x                    UN Navy is never
seen here, Corporate Navies are rare and most traffic is pirates and
privateers travelling to unregistered colony worlds of Exiles which serve as
bases...

        If either the destination world or origin world is under blockade,
quarentine or similar restrictions, an additonal x0.5 is added to the ARM.

        So, while you will make a killing hauling cargo on the Frontier, you
are also reasonably likely to get into a major firefight once or twice a
year that could cost you some major repair bills.

        As always, your comments, questions and critiques are welcome.

Those other factors _are_ economics.  If Store B can\'t offer

Why?  TNS is still (sort of) in existence, under the auspices of SJGames. 
Lucan already figures there, announcing that he\'ll follow the example of
his brother Varian and make a Grand Tour of the Imperium.
http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/news.html and 
http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/traveller/oldnews.html

Of course, I don\'t think there is a Marine Academy.  Officially (per High
Guard), if Marine officers attend any sort of service academy, it\'s the
Naval Academy.

Ground-heat is where you have piping running pretty deep underground,
and you use the heat differentials between the outdoors, the inside of the
house, and the constant 50-some odd degree F underground to make
your house just the right temperature. I believe you can even use the
temperature gradient to get water hot enough for showers and household
use.

Some problems I\'ve heard include very slow temperature changes,
high installation expenses, and the way you have to turn the whole
system on to get a dishpan full of hot water.
(Recollection while I worked computer support for NY State Electric
and Gas of a little old lady being very annoyed at us for talking her into
trying out this system in her house. Our marketing department gave her
a modern oil heat system and ate the cost, probably writing it off as a 
research expense, rather than take a "preying on senior citizens" PR hit.)

The problem is that there is no apparent reason why this

But how old was Lucan at the time of the assassination?  He was *way* over 18, 
wasn\'t he???

Your formula is unclear.  Is the second term 500 _divided by_ jump parsecs,
or is it 500 _per_ jump parsec?

I\'m curious because if its the former, its reasonably close to the Far Trader
figures.

Well, depends on the ship obviously.  And the motivation.
The US was churning out Libery ships during WWII
at an absolutely unbelievable pace.  I think the record was
something like 36 hours.

With pre-fab standard parts and robotic hull construction,
it shouldn\'t take long at all  - at TL 15 a day for the raw ship
I\'d say.  But calibrating the jump drive?  Thats a tough question.

I\'m not sure.  I found two separate birth years for Lucan in Joseph Heck\'s
library data file (http://www.missouri.edu/~ccjoe/traveller/library/ )

If we take the 1094 date from Dresden\'s entry (his father), Lucan\'s only 22
in 1116 (the abortive assassination in the GT timeline).  Entry into the
service or an academy certainly could be delayed by a few years for a major
noble such as he.

Unfortunately, his own biography says 1088, which makes him 28 and too old.

Anyone know which is right?

No reason why they shouldn\'t, except IMTU, where Marine officers must 
complete the same basic training as everyone else and serve a year in the
enlisted ranks before going to the Officer Course.

GURPS is slightly more coy about this, but I think it\'s basically the same.
 Behind the Claw says his retrieval of the warrant "is a tale in its own
right."

:-)  

Again per BTC, Norris is a very talented intell analyst and a very well
regarded officer (if not command material).  BTC has him operating in the
field against terrorists in the Old Expanses and Diaspora, before being
transferred to the Tactics college (whatever that is) back in the Marches. 


Also, isn\'t there some ambiguity about who the warrant was really intended
for.  IIRC, it\'s written in the Dumas fashion ("The bearer has done what
the bearer has done..." so to speak.)

Well, Norris isn\'t much for female company (his daughter is a clone, after
all)

more like 36 days, but this is still an incredilble rate. We literally built 
more shipping tonnage for both the US and British merchant marine, than the 
Germans could sink at the hight of the battle of the Atlantic...Before the 
war we built capital ships in 2-3 years. By 1944 (when naval capital ship 
building rates were SLOWED DOWN as a result of lack of need...they figured if 
they\'re not finished by 1945, the war will be over before they are ready and 
steel was in short supply; better to go to quicker built items like 
freighters, escorts, and landing ships...); this rate was down to about a 
year to a year and a half. The only reason it wasn\'t faster, was that we 
hadn\'t figured out how to adapt liberty ship modular construction methods to 
battleships and carriers. We have now have and have shaved off more than 2 
years from the building times of a Nimitz class carrier. The lead ship took 
about 5 years (I think), and now they are down to less than three...It saves 
both Newport News and the Defense dept a lot of money....

Ob Trav: does this tie into economies of scale in the 3I? (ie: the more the 
3I builds, and gets better at; the cheaper and quicker they get...)

Yes it takes a great deal of effort and resources.  During the Solomani Rim
War, after the Solomani Fleet was defeated at some battle or another, the
Imperial High Command decided to invade Terra to finally put an end to
Solomani supremacy hype.  This involved breaking off pursuit of the
defeated fleet and bringing in most of their other fleet elements for the
invasion.

According t the Order of Battle chart from the Invasion: Terra game, the
Imperial fleet went in with:

14 BatRons
7 CruRons
3 Scout squadrons
4 Transport Squadrons
6 Colonial BatRons
8 Colonial CruRons

1 20-factor Marine division
5 5-factor Marine regiments
2 5C-factor armies
16 1C-factor corps
8 20-factor divisions
6 10-factor brigades
10 1C-factor colonial corps
4 20-factor colonial divisions
2 10-factor colonial brigades
2 20-factor mercenary divisions
3 10-factor mercenary brigades
1 5-factor mercenary regiment

After the invasion was completed, they didn\'t have the resources to
continue their invasion of the Solomani Sphere.

manpower terms, the invasion of Earth not only ate up the grand fleet,

throughout the rimward Imperium.

According to the S.S. JOHN W. BROWN Web site:

The Kaiser shipyard in Oakland, California, built the
     S/S ROBERT E PEARY, from keel laying to launching, in
     4 days 15 hours and 30 minutes. The PEARY was then
     outfitted, painted, taken on sea trials, the crew was trained
     and the vessel fully loaded with 10,000 tons of cargo. The
     PEARY sailed 7 days after the keel was laid. 

This site further mentions that:

Once the production lines got under way, the time taken
     to build a Liberty at Fairfield dropped to as little as 28
     days. On the average, it took 592,000 man-hours to build
     a Liberty Ship.

A description of the Liberty ships, from the S.S. JEREMIAH O\'BRIEN Web

I\'m not sure really; the Director\'s cut (shorter, no voice over plus the
dream sequence) seems to hint more at the original Dick novel. The crisis
of identity for Deckard (a replicant, although unknown to himself until the
last seconds of the re-release) is quite subtley.

cf \'How can it not know what it is?\' Deckard

cf \'Have you ever taken the [voigt-kampf] test yourself?\' Rachel

cf \'Have you ever retired a human by mistake?\' Rachel

What I found was re-watching the film after finding out what Deckard was
from the link between the dream sequence and the origami unicorn made me
realise just how loaded the conversation really is.

Sad the ending was changed for fear that a US public acustomed to \'Star
Wars\' wouldn\'t like it because it is too dark and poorly explained in
comparison.

Everything - they stop all energy (everything!) crossing the barrier and
shunt it to capacitors. Ships in it can\'t manuever or discharge this energy
so can be killed by overloading the capacitors. To resolve these problems,
ships normally flicker the black globe.

Black globes were originally Ancient artifacts, but canon implies a limited
number of prototypes are now available at TL15.

Michael asked:
>Has anyone ever considered specialization in Traveller Skills?

From the official rules viewpoint:

CT, no.

MT used Skill Clusters to group skill together. It also had "serves as"
skills, which are a minor form of specialisation rules. One skill could be
used in place of another but at -1. Finally, it had a Default level of
skill (level 0), where you didn\'t get any bonuses from having the skill,
BUT your difficultly level didn\'t go up due to not having the skill,
either.

TNE used clusters _with_ specialisation, so that you used your
specialisation at full effect, and the other skills in the cluster at half
effect.

From memory, T4 went back to the MT version.

G:T? Ask a GURPS player.  ;-)  However, probably not, since one of my
gripes with GURPS (or Rolemaster etc) is that this rule DOESN\'T exist,
meaning you have too many skills for the PC\'s to choose from - too many
specialities to cover. Glenn has already illustrated this point very well,
both in terms of balance (atomic vs broad skills) and campaign-specific
effects ("I\'ll fix up the K\'kree with my Medic-3 [Xenobiology] skill while
you track down the disease with your Medic-3 [Infectious Diseases] skill").
Eris would appear to agree, giving us a version similar in concept to TNE
but with CT/MT/T4 numbers. The "x3" seems to work well, BTW, although you
may need to specify more catagories.

BTW, one source for medical and engineering specialities is "The Imperial
Academy of Science and Medicine" article in JTAS #21(correct number?).

If you are using GURPS and *want* to broaden the PC\'s skill base, write
your own rule. Consider what skills should be lumped together - MT is a
good base for this decision - and say that the PC can use such-and-such a
skill in place of the required skill, just at a lesser efficacy.

There are problems with the Shionthy/Kinunir explanation. I raised this
earlier on the list, and posted the outcomes of the ensuing discussion on
my website. Go to "Hyphen\'s Traveller Pages" and look for (I think) the
Kinunir Question.

OK, then the source I used was messed up.  Since I don\'t own the Rebellion
Sourcebook, I have to work with what I can find online.  The source I cited
came readily to hand and purports to be based entirely on GDW library data
entries.  

On the original question, this seems to leave the possibility of Lucan\'s
future military career, if any, open.

Nope the record was either 24 or 36 _hours_. I saw part of a documentary on
the subject recently. The liberty ships were also the first major groups of
ships built where the joins were welded rather than riveted together which
related to some acidents with the early liberty ships (If I remember
correctly some of them literally broke in half, due to the temperature.)

I second that. I only recently got copies, but the standard of these works is

Thanks for the welcome Eris.  I was able to get the gist of "IMTU" and "OTU"
but if you hadn\'t told me, I would probably not have known and be left
wondering (you know how it is...).

I understand fully what you are saying about "canon" also, and I too loved
the read of the OTU published hardware (in my time, it was all CT and a
touch of MT... with, for me, CT being optimal for it\'s amazing ease of play
with a variety of players that couldn\'t handle the added "difficulties" of
MT if you can believe it!).  To this day, I still extol the absolute
completeness of the Traveller universe to my Robotech and AD&D playing
friends -- nothing in my mind comes close to the detail and "realism" of the
Traveller background (that was an unpaid announcement on behalf of Traveller
in all it\'s incarnations by The Roc).

But don\'t we all have an "IMTU" regardless of how we play it?  Hmmmm... hang
on... Sorry, I just recalled... I can get passionate about something\'s
people say about game rules and personal amendments (house rules)... Let\'s
just strike that comment shall we?

Thanks again, maybe I\'ll borrow back my stuff and run a CT campaign again
soon!

 Doesn\'t this change the nature of interstellar

In my view, the problem isnt the economic system is broken - it\'s the
starship designs.

The key is the High Guard requirement for a 20 dton bridge. FFS2 et al
drops this - if a 200 dton Far Trader has a 4 dton bridge, then you get
another 16 dtons of cargo space, which turns into KCr 24 per trip at Cr
1500 a jump 2. I\'d strongly advise you to drop the 20 dton minimum for
non-military ships - it\'s MilSpec sensors etc etc etc.

Just take the exchange rate table and make a a TL11 starport A value 1 and
refigure everything else (for starships, just do 9-A and 10-A credits).

What profit rates does a 1000 dton trader built under HG make ? Remember,
you can put 10 hardpoints on it, so it\'ll be more heavily defended as well.

If you have freight prices that make a 200 dton jump-1 freighter
profitable, than a 1000 dton jump-1 freighter should make serious money.

Well, it\'s a FFS2 design at TL9, but my 8000 dton Decafreighter came in at
about MCr 990 for 6500 dtons of cargo space. I\'d argue it\'s the small hull
sizes in the TNEC that push up freight costs rather than the TL per se.

Yup. Thats the way it should be. Spend some serious money on the best

The *median* misjump looks to be 10 or 11 parsecs (I\'m not sure if I
miskeyed my calculator and don\'t feel like rekeying everything). That
is, there would be as many jumps *more* than 10 or 11 as there are
*less* than.

In my view, the problem isnt the economic system is broken - it\'s the

The key is the High Guard requirement for a 20 dton bridge. FFS2 et al
drops this - if a 200 dton Far Trader has a 4 dton bridge, then you get
another 16 dtons of cargo space, which turns into KCr 24 per trip at Cr
1500 a jump 2. I\'d strongly advise you to drop the 20 dton minimum for
non-military ships - it\'s MilSpec sensors etc etc etc.

That 20dtn minimum comes from CT Starships, not High Guard.
I always read it as things of minimum volume. A civilian sensor suite
takes up X amount of space, the military can fit more stuff into the
same amount of space. Not to mention that bridge crew work areas
and avionics access will take up a certain amount of room no matter
how good your sensors are.

How small can you make the bridge workstations, sensors, and avionics of 
a 200dtn civilian ship in FFS2? Can you fit all that into 4dtn?

You are right about my incorrect usage of the word \'economics.\'  In my haste

I disagree.  The Real World(tm) is full of businesses which are using
equipment that is either out-dated or ill-suited to its purpose.  Many
companies have failed to upgrade their computer technology, for example,
even though the economic benefits are well-documented.  Some companies
haven\'t even converted to true computerization, they rely on man-power to
accomplish basic task that could easily be automated.

I\'m not saying that they will be expensive to construct or implement.  I\'m
saying that if Drop Tanks are implemented, then inter-system traffic will
become dependent on jumpstations.  Jumpstations will then become a point at
which bottlenecks can occur.  I can picture long delays at busy systems, and
other systems having excess capacity.

Basically, I agree that Drop Tanks can become a fly in the ointment if not
handled properly.  I am trying to point out, for those of us who don\'t wish
to use Drop Tanks (or wish to limit their usage somehow), that there are
many ways to accomplish this.  Furthermore, we don\'t have to come up with
"The Big Reason" why they aren\'t used, we can simply use many small reasons
which, in combination, limit (or rule out) the usage of Drop Tanks.

Of course, you are right about my incorrect use of the term economics.  In
my haste to reply, I got careless. I should have used \'price\' or \'cost\'
instead of \'economics.\'

I disagree.  In fact, the Real World(tm) is full of companies doing business
with equipment that is out-dated or ill-suited to its purpose.  Companies
are still using computer equipment, for example, that is badly in need of
upgrade/replacement even though the advantages of updating are quite clear.
Many companies have not even made a \'real\' transition to computer
technology, and instead rely on simple man-power to accomplish tasks.  Even
if Drop Tanks are the greatest thing since microwave popcorn, there will be
large segments of the industry that will not use them for any number of
arbitrary reasons.

I\'m not saying that they will be expensive to build.  I am saying that if a
conversion to Drop Tanks occurs, and reliance on jump stations follows, then
inter-system traffic will become dependant on them.  Thus, if a jumpstation
is insufficient, bottlenecks will occur.  Determining the size and capacity
of stations will be important to minimize delays and to avoid building
excess capability (that would be wasted).  If modern automobile traffic
control could be used as an example, I picture long delays in busy systems
and finding some systems with jump stations with little to do but count
tanks.

Basically I agree that Drop Tanks can become a fly in the ointment if not
handled properly.  I am trying to point out though, that for those of us who
don\'t wan\'t to use them (or significantly reduce their use), there are ample
opportunities to come up with plausible explanations as to why they aren\'t
used.  Furthermore, we don\'t have to come up with one \'Big\' reason, we can
rely on a number of small reasons, that when taken together spell the end of
(or only marginal usage of) Drop Tanks.

I have heard of these things you talk about, but I also remember 
studying something called a Finite State Machine (iirc) and one of 
the rules was, "You can never write a program that will predict the 
behaviour of another program."  Forward Compatibility falls into that 
category:  "I cannot write Program A today that will predict what a 
future version of Program A will do."  Unless I wish to limit future 
enhancements to Program A.

However, I think we are talking about apples and oranges.

If you wish to discuss this further, please email me and save some 
bandwidth for everyone else.  If I am totally offbase, I wish to know 
and would be intrigued.

Based on my theory of Jump space, there would not be a coincidence in

That is very much in line with how I think of Jump space.

        Hi, Bloo!
        That is Cr500 per parsec cargo needs to be carried...  so, Jp1 is

to someone, and I\'m wondering what a reasonable profit would be?  (Note:
this is set in M0, and they are in the Core sector.)

This was, as I thought would be obvious, a sarcastic comment.  I\'ll

Actually, I\'m pretty sure its just an artifact of rolling d6 d6\'s

Here\'s an idea... rather than rolling d6 d6\'s, roll the drive rating d6\'s
or limit the number of dice to the drive rating.

SMART CARDS: GLOBAL AT LAST 

Mark Anderson
Special to ABCNEWS.com

The world has also been waiting for a long time for global
standards and related applications for smart cards that
would drive their use into the U.S. market and across
previously proprietary technical boundaries. That word
came last week, with the announcement of an agreement
between VISA International, Europay International
(MasterCard\'s European partner) and two other
European credit card groups on a specification for the
"e-purse." 

The Common E-Purse Specification already carries
the approval of financial institutions in 22 countries, in
sum representing about 130 million potential customers. The
group\'s first goal is to achieve 90 percent penetration of
the current GeldKarte (60 million), Proton (30 million)
and Visa Cash (10 million) card holders. The function of
the cards will be to allow small purchases, such as for
transit or small services, to be paid anywhere by any card,
replacing pocket change in various currencies. The initial
marketing plan foresees using the euro currency conversion
in January 2001 as a leverage point, and moving into the U.S.
market from there.

Ultimately, the goal, in my mind at least, is to carry a
single smart card that can provide e-purse (e-cash) services,
ATM services, privacy/key/badge services for car, home and
office, plus all manner of shop transaction services. Other
useful data stores include organ-donor status, medical
emergency information, ID and a host of access codes/passwords
for Net-based services.

        Well, except that its been there since CT, and under HG it is a
minimum 20tons, else a percentage of hull size.  I could turf it, but I am
really trying to fit something within the existing framework, instead of
jetisoning pieces that will complicate comparisons between my HG designs and
someone elses....

        I suppose, except that this doesn\'t sound too speedy at the gaming

         As I commented on the CT-Starships mailing list, I find this very
odd.  I have never had a player *want* a Type-A...  even those who got one
for mustering out *immediatley* sold it for a minor profit and designed a
*real* ship that would make money.  If only so they could do more
interesting things and not be a slave to the loan payments.
        That so many of them exist in canon indicates to me that either the
average merchant is a masochist with a penchant for heartache, or they need
to fit the 3%-5% RORPA window somehow.  I am aiming at the later scenario.  =)

        And have some serious overhead, too.  Specifically, 10 more gunners
per month and 5 times as many engineers.

        Without...  We\'re not talking about going and buying a TL9 ship in a
TL11 milieu, we\'re talking about a TL9 ship that was build 50 years ago at
TL9 now competing for Cr against a TL11 ship built at TL11...  both cost
100%, but the TL11 vessel has the economics of the milieu on its side.

        In the Core, only mail-haulers bother with gunners.
        In the Frontier, Gunnery is an *art form*.  In fact, in some cases,
the salary for gunners is doubled by the mega-corps.

        From a role-playing perspective, my FTF group looked at the entire
concept of the Core and said..  "Hmmm... sounds boring...  we can make more
money out here..."  =)

The two ways to get to this point:

(a) Slow but sure.
 a1. Jump insystem. Fly to the Gas Giant, and establish space supremecy 
     over it. Call in the rest of the fleet.
 a2. Move to the mainworld. Defeat anything else in space.
 a3. Reduce the planetary defences (Deep mesons et al). This may take
     some general destruction of surface support facilities like 
     sensors.
 a4. Beat off any fleets that are sent in the meantime.

(b) Hasty.
 b1. Jump insystem, and rush to the mainworld, defeating any spacecraft.
 b2. Flatten anything that looks like a sensor.

You need to secure a landing zone for regular forces, as you say. There
are two options - take an existing one, or bring your own. Taking an
existing downport is going to be hard if the defenders have half a clue,
since even if your marines can bring overwhelming force to bear, the
facility is going to be wrecked. So we bring one with us.

We land on some suitable terrain (reasonably near the objectives);
secure it, and bring an `insta-downport\' - earthmoving equipment to
throw up blast berms and whathaveyou, modular buildings to run the place
out of; portable fuel facilities.

While this is going on, you need to keep the defenders away from the
landing zone. You have the advantage of orbital sensors and support fire
(your fleet); the defenders know the area and have popular support /
special forces (What? You mean that the main condenser on *every*
Caterpillar is wrecked)

Once you\'re got your heavy troops on the ground, you\'re almost home...


Anyone care to turn out some designs for the modular downport and
earthmoving gear?

Actually, any medium or better population world with a breathable

Why is 28 "too old"?

At least in the current miltary it is possible to "come up thru the
ranks", and wind up attending the academy to get the education you
missed the first time around. It ain\'t *common*, but it\'s *possible*.

Matt,

Kill every civilian who knows, even in general, where your portable starport
is. Make sure you have shut down the entire planetary communication
grid, and find a way to confiscate every transmitter that\'s in the hands
of the populace. Find some way to locate and confiscate the meson
communicators that have been hidden away for use by the resistance
after a "successful" invasion.

There will be deep meson sites and meson submersibles that have no
intention of firing at your fleet. They\'re going to wait for you to set up
housekeeping, and snipe at you - one or two shots a week - for as long
as you are on the planet. Anything you have that doesn\'t move is going
to explode pretty soon.

True. If the planet isn\'t your ultimate objective, you might be blockading it
for the rest of the war. Let\'s say it\'s the Ag-world breadbasket for several
inhospitable enemy worlds, and all you want to do is stop the grain
shipments for a while. If it\'s an industrial world, you may decide you\'d
rather see it\'s grav tank production sit safely in factory warehouses,
rather than get shipped to the ground fights you did get involved with.
Whether these outcomes are worth tying up fleet elements is another
question.

Then there\'s always the idea of hitting his ability to ride out a blockade.
Only possible with less habitable worlds - say you\'re willing to sacrifice
a couple hundred starfighters to get a good chance at destroying their
vital water treatment plants, on a planet with no naturally drinkable water.
Sure, the plants can be fixed - but can they be fixed in time?

Or try the above trick with saboteurs, if your intelligence service is
up to the task.

A habitable planet with good population and tech, yeah, you\'re not going
to get them to surrender with a blockade under normal circumstances.

Oy!!!

How to turn a planetary invasion into a meatgrinder.

Such opressive tactics will generally not only stiffen the resolve of
the home team, it\'ll also make a huge pool of willing recruits.

Sort of like Germany\'s failed supression of Yugoslavian partisans during
WWII. They tried the terror tactic of killing 100 civilians for every
German killed by the partisans. The civilians rapidly figured out that
going to join the partisans meant they got a rifle to shoot back at the
Germans rather than waiting for the Germans to kill them anyway. I dont
remember how many divisions of troops Germany needed desperately
elsewhere got chewed up by that one!

ObTrav...the only truly detailed canon example of this is the 3I\'s
invasion of Terra during the Solomani Rim War.

Even though the 3I had superior logistics by that point, the invasion
and subsequent occupation drained them completely. Gad, the hidey holes
Solomani gurillas must have had on Terra. The Impies probably couldn\'t
move anywhere on the planet except in large, armored forces.

The only tactical difference between the 3I and Germany a that point ws
that the 3I, fortunately, wasn\'t fighting a major war on another couple
of fronts.

In general, I\'ll suspect that Hugh Tech High Pop systems simply do not
get invaded in this fashion.

Yeah; but MT Hard Times prefessed that once a planet\'s off world trade is cut 
off and the have to go self sufficient, their TL plummets down to what they 
can maintain (they suggested as low as TL7 which seems a little too severe to 
me...). Since they were making TL15 widgets for trade for other TL15 products 
and spare parts, they were locked into economies of scale/comparative 
adventage trade models, and this was suddenly cut off...

So you wait for the planet\'s TL to plummet down low enough to make an 
invasion more doable...

Especially since all it\'ll take is one person with binoculars and a
compass to get you the coords to blow hell out of it.

Sub-based meson guns are _really_ nasty things to go up against. If you
just shoot and scoot, it\'ll be next to impossible to target you, ever.
You have the advantage of knowing the ground like, well, your own
backyard.

Hmm...methinks I\'ll have to get into the MG design rules and break out
Andy\'s FFS2 spreadsheet...gotta design some variants on MG subs.

On a mostly water world, I think those things would rule, period. You
wouldn\'t want to even think about invading.

I can\'t help with that question, but I do remember from playing Invasion:
Earth that the Impies had to establish "beachheads" before they could land
troops other than drop troops.  I\'ll have to go back over the the contents
of the game and see what I can find.

Personally, I think this would be a great job for those older ships that
are streamlined and have enough life left in them for "one more mission".
Add a s**tload of addon armor, high power beyond all recognition meson
screens, and remove the space to space weapons and replace it with surface
support weapons.  In short, make a run like Yamato tried before it was sent
to the bottom of the Pacific.

This would give not only a strongpoint, but support from the moment it landed.

You have CG technology, set your starport up some place remote and
defensible and set up command center where you need them.  Do not forget air

For the subs use satalite thermal tracking in case they get sloppy and
roving sonar searching robots and bouyes.  For deep meson sites symographic
sensors followed by ordinary.

Also meson guns are straight line weapons.  After hitting 3 stationary
targets a non mobile meson site can be triagulated and it a sub fires to
often it to can be \'triangulated\' into a small area and killed.

True, for normal poeople.  But we\'re not talking about someone who would be
coming up through the ranks. We\'re talking about Lucan, third in line to
the Iridium throne.  I take it as a given that he would not be an enlisted

Small technical problem with a1. "The Gas Giant." Most systems have 
more than one. The solar system has four. If a system is being 
attacked, any decent strategist would figure out that the attackers 
had occupied the "usual" one, so reinforcements might simply come and 
secure another one... taking into account orbits, it\'s improbable 
that a single gas giant would *always* be the closest one to the 
mainworld, so it is even unclear if there is always a single gas 
giant presenting an strategical advantage to take over a world.

Well, apparently though the two people who matter on the subject (Scott and
Ford) can\'t agree on whether or not Deckard was a human or a replicant.
Scott has maintained, more or less, that Deckard is. Even in the
non-director\'s cut there are clues. On the other hand, Ford was never given
directions by Scott that he was a replicant and in an interview stated that
he found the idea somewhat stupid.

On the other hand, the Dick work dealt *heavily* with the concept of
identity, paying little attention to the question of the humanity of the
replicants.

>cf \'How can it not know what it is?\' Deckard
>
>cf \'Have you ever taken the [voigt-kampf] test yourself?\' Rachel

>cf \'Have you ever retired a human by mistake?\' Rachel


There\'s another thing to: only the eyes of replicants are shown to glow in
the dark (the owl in Tyrell\'s conference room and Rachel in another). In one
scene Deckard\'s eyes are clearly going. Scott has claimed that it was his
intent to have only the replicants with glowing eyes. He said that the other
characters in the film can\'t see it, it\'s purely and effect for the
audiences.

Yep.

Well, it depends: The only version available for sale (and as far as I can
tell at most places, for rent) is the Director\'s Cut, which has the
"correct" ending. It\'s a wonder why the film became so popular. Scott
fumbled the ball at several points (pay careful attention to the number of
"skin-jobs" on the street, there\'s one unaccounted for). Then take a look at
the scene where he retires the snake-dancer. It\'s all out of sequence. The
studio dropped the ball by cutting the unicorn dream sequence, changing the
ending and adding the completely inappropriate narration. Fortunately,
thanks to WB I\'ve gotten a chance to see the DC on the big screen ;^)

At any rate, though I can\'t defend it better, I still maintain that the core
of the movie revolves around the humanity of the replicants, not the
identity of various characters (as Dick\'s work does).

Trivia question: The term "Blade Runner" is never used by Dick. What author
was the term borrowed from?

Blade Runner, by (Scott)??Nolan, MD. A dark tale of the future where
medical care is severely rationed...IIRC (and this is a looooong time
ago folks, I think I was 12 when I read it) after age 60 you get none.
The protagonist is a \'blade runner\'; a doctor who provides underground
health care to these people.

That was part of it. The other part was Harrison Ford, who felt strongly
that the audience "still needed a hero to root for".

Maybe the "dark and poorly explained" is only a problem for US audiences? I
mean the director has said, even of the voice-over version, "the French
have no difficulty in picking it up" [ie. the possibility of Deckard being
a replicant].

High Guard and Book 2 don\'t take sensors or avionics into account. I\'m
willing to bet that the FF&S philosophy is to split the "bridge" up into
its components, allowing you to optimise the design. If you don\'t need the
full-blown, expensive, bulky milspec sensor suite and NOE avionics, you get
away with having a smaller bridge.

I *know* MT splits out avionics and all the sensors, but (I can\'t remember,
sorry) does MT require you to set aside 20t for a bridge AS WELL?

Who cares what Ford thinks.  His job is to do what the director wants.

Many people have used the unaccounted replicant as further evidence
that Deckard is a replicant.  I recall reading one take on this that said
Deckard the replicant took Deckard the human\'s identity.

Used to know that.

I enjoy the fact that when you first learn of the replicants, particular
Rutger\'s
character, you see the name, last name first, up on the screen.

Batty, Ray.
Batty-ray
Battery.

He\'s a electronic, a battery, and batty as well.

	Unless you can drain rigid tanks and blow them away fast enough for
jump, but you CAN\'T suck flexible tanks AND draw them inside (intact)
fast enough ...

	This one actually makes perfect sense to me ...

	Why not? If you search the TML archive, you should find the

reasonable?


Oh, what the heck. I\'ll spare you the trouble of the search. Here\'s
the original post:

Date: Sat, 20 Sep 1997 05:18:01 -0400 (EDT)
From: CardSharks@aol.com
Subject: Re: Trade or Sell

Once upon a time, when D&D was still new, just about everyone at GDW
made
aphotocopy of the basic D&D books because they were not yet available
in
evnough volume for everyone to have their own copy.

Once the sets became available, we all went out and bought them and
discarded
the photocopies... which were just inferior.

If someone makes a photocopy for his or her own use, that is called
fair use,
as long as it\'s not the whole product, and as long as its not for
resale.
That includes copying someone else\'s copy of the product.

That is especially true if the product itself is not currently
available (ie
CT or Mt, probably not for T4).

When someone starts photocopying multtiple copies for others, then it
gets to
be infringement.

Personally, if you want a specific work which isn\'t in print and you
can get
a photocopy, I think that\'s OK.

	Michael asked:
	>Has anyone ever considered specialization in Traveller Skills?

	From the official rules viewpoint:

	CT, no.

	MT used Skill Clusters to group skill together. It also had "serves
as"
	skills, which are a minor form of specialisation rules. One skill
could be
	used in place of another but at -1. Finally, it had a Default level
of
	skill (level 0), where you didn\'t get any bonuses from having the
skill,
	BUT your difficultly level didn\'t go up due to not having the skill,
	either.

	TNE used clusters _with_ specialisation, so that you used your
	specialisation at full effect, and the other skills in the cluster
at half
	effect.

	From memory, T4 went back to the MT version.

	G:T? Ask a GURPS player.  ;-)  However, probably not, since one of
my
	gripes with GURPS (or Rolemaster etc) is that this rule DOESN\'T
exist,
	meaning you have too many skills for the PC\'s to choose from - too
many
	specialities to cover. Glenn has already illustrated this point very
well,
	both in terms of balance (atomic vs broad skills) and
campaign-specific
	effects ("I\'ll fix up the K\'kree with my Medic-3 [Xenobiology] skill
while
	you track down the disease with your Medic-3 [Infectious Diseases]
skill").
	Eris would appear to agree, giving us a version similar in concept
to TNE
	but with CT/MT/T4 numbers. The "x3" seems to work well, BTW,
although you
	may need to specify more catagories.

	BTW, one source for medical and engineering specialities is "The
Imperial
	Academy of Science and Medicine" article in JTAS #21(correct
number?).

	If you are using GURPS and *want* to broaden the PC\'s skill base,
write
	your own rule. Consider what skills should be lumped together - MT
is a
	good base for this decision - and say that the PC can use
such-and-such a
	skill in place of the required skill, just at a lesser efficacy.

	David "Hyphen" Jaques-Watson        

	From memory T4 did go back to the MT version for some skill
clusters, but it also killed a fair amount (such as Liaison which served as
Streetwise-1 and Administration-1. I think that\'s right, but don\'t quote
me). 

	Using T4 but with a variant MT task resolution system instead I
assigned each skill a series of related skills, as well as breaking up
really broad skills into smaller units (such as Medical and Tactics). 

	For an unskilled default I had a DM of -3 and skill which was
related to another could either serve as that skill with a DM of -3 or add a
bonus of (Related Skill -3), whichever is more beneficial.   

	For example I made Physics related to Astrogation and thus someone
with Physics-2 who was unskilled in Astrogation actually had a default of -1
instead of -3.  If he/she had Physics-4, then if unskilled in Astrogation
they could perform the task at level (4-3 = 1) or, if skilled in
Astrogation, add a bonus DM of (4-3 = 1) to the roll. 

	Those using a related skill at a default still suffered extra time
penalties etc. over that of a skilled astrogator, but they still were much
better off than Johnny No Skill.

	BTW, the justification for the Astrogation - Physics relationship
was from a old Harry Harrison book about an adrift lifepod (I think it was
the venerable HH) where the navigator was dead and a Professor of Physics
took his place (albeit at reduced ability)

	Of course this all assumes that Traveller Astrogation is based on
Physics and I\'ll feel like a total total gimboid if this is not the case. 

	Anyway, the whole point was that I managed to keep an element of the
\'serves as\' in T4 that was nicer on defaults than T4 was (IMHO). 

	Any comments/problems/queries/blasting/jibes etc?

for use of the title. I have this from the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, so 
I assume it\'s correct :-). Also per another article, BR producer Michael 
Deeley claimed blade runner was also an obscure victorian term for private 
detective.

Some other trivia snippets:
- - Dustin Hoffman was considered for the role of Deckard
- - Dick suggested Victoria Principal for the Sean Young role
- - the original novel is set in 1992, the film is set in 2020
- - Pre-production titles included "The Android", "Animal", "Mechanismo" and 
"Dangerous Days"
- - Scott was also keen on the title "Gotham City" but Bob Kane refused 
permission to use it
- - the Deckard character was originally conceived as being similar to Bogart\'s 
Marlowe, and was to wear a felt hat. Ford vetoed the hat idea because he\'d 
just come off Lost Ark and didn\'t want to carry over the same look into his 
next movie.
- - the closing scenes in the original cut were in fact out-takes from The 
Shining, provided by WB after the closing reshoot went way over budget
- - the look of the film & set was heavily drawn from Heavy Metal, in particular 
Moebius, who went on to do the design work for Fifth Element (and other stuff, 
for that matter)

That\'s probably true today, but will it be true 3,000 years from now, in
a society in which women have total equality (which can be inferred from
comments in the character generation system), and have had it for some
time?  In my Traveller universe, one of the great attractions of
Imperial service for women and non-humans in the Imperium is that those
services foster a culture in which discrimination on the basis of
species, gender, religion, etc. is not tolerated, while that is often
not the case in member states.  (The major exception is that social
standing can be a major assist in a Navy career.)  

In any case, I still think a Marine being a Marine (and my Imperial
Marines are even more gung ho than the US Marines of today) would still
wear full dress uniform.

Remember that the warrant was sent to Norris with, if I recall
correctly, a small fleet. The ship carrying the warrant was shot down
over Algine, an interdicted world.  Norris violated the interdiction to
retrieve the warrant.  Once he had the warrant, he pardoned himself for
violating the red zone.  It was a risk -- if the warrant hadn\'t actually
been there, he was in violation of Imperial law.

Why Norris?  Because Admiral Santanocheev had alienated Naval
Intelligence by forming his own body of yes-sophonts to tell him that
all was well with respect to the Zhodani. Norris had had a distinguished
career as a Naval Intelligence officer before his brother, the heir to
the duchy, died.  When he reported on Santanocheev\'s ineffectiveness to
the Imperial high command, he had the credibility to be believed, and
eventually was given command of all Imperial forces in the Marches for
the duration of the war.

How about some nice patch of ocean?  You can do soft landings, you can hide

At high TLs, wet navies are still relevant on many worlds, aren\'t they? 
And since they\'re grav units, they can operate on desert worlds too.

The problem with Blade Runner - and IMHO what keeps it _out_ of the ranks of
the great - is that Ford and Scott were not on the same sheet of music. Each
had a very conflicting aesthetic that they brought into the film and (more
that likely subconciously) fought each other the whole time.

My belief is that Liaison was zapped in order to make room for Diplomacy (a
very similar skill). I think Marc wanted Diplomacy in order to give M:0
nobles something to do.  ;-)  I mean, Diplomacy *is* Liaison, just with a
more restricted (and therefore clearer) definition.

I always found that Liaison was a weird one, sitting as it does above
Streetwise and Admin in terms of the social classes it deals with. Maybe a
case can be made to retain both Liaison and Diplomacy  - although as I said
in another topic, I generally dislike making extra specialities. Here\'s an
instance where the Default/Included rule should be used: if I have some
ability to deal with military types, for eg (Liaison), then I should have
at least some idea of how to communicate with diplomats and higher social
classes (Diplomacy-1 or -2).

That\'s basically correct. Scott has said he got the term from a work by
William S. Burroughs called "Blade Runner: The Movie." There is a note
towards the end of the credits that puts out a special thank you to William
S. Burroughs which supports his claim. However, Burroughs didn\'t come up
with it originally. He got the term from Alan E. Nourse who wrote the book
"The Bladerunner." The Burroughs work is based on the Nourse book with some
changes here and there.

Yes, I\'ve heard this one myself. There was supposed to be another replicant.
She was in the script but cut out sometime during the filming. She was a
"super-mom" model. Ultimately, this is why the scenes toward the middle of
the film are somewhat out of sequence. The cut her out, but they didn\'t film
certain scenes over. The initial count is incorrect also.

It\'s one of those things that you notice after a few viewings and you\'re

alcohol and wounds.

Battery. That\'s a pretty good one ;^)

ObTrav: You can\'t walk fifty feet IMTU without tripping over an android.
Different TLs and cultures have different methods of designing creating and
using androids. My Imperium doesn\'t consider them citizens, but some planets
do. They are often created by different corporations with certain
distinguishing characteristics: eyes that are completely black, markings
weaved into their skin, bizarre coloration, no hair, etc. You get the drift.
Some are completely biological, as the replicants appear to be in Blade
Runner, while others are completely electro-mechanical. Many sit somewhere
in between.

Of course, all my high-pop worlds look like Sid Meade\'s futuristic Los
Angeles in Blade Runner ;^)

  {
    'body' => 'Executive Summary:

Ship construction rules a la TCS are wartime hyperproduction
only.  Shipyards are designed to meet demand.  (Exception is
Naval shipyards, of course, but those won\'t build civilian ships).

For more realistic build rates per year, divide your starport
\'A\' system\'s population by 1,000,000.  That may be somewhere
between  2.5% and 10% of your annual ship-traffic-tonnage.  If
it takes 30 to 40 years to replace a ship, then divide traffic by 30
to 40 and that\'s your demand.  Please know that this number is
general... some starports do much better business for all kinds of
reasons.  That\'s where adventures can begin.



Body of Argument:

It sounds reasonable that an Imperial shipyard can cobble
together a starship in a relatively short time, given robotic
facilities, modular components, etc.

Why would a shipyard want to build a starship in one day?

It wouldn\'t.  Why?

Demand isn\'t high enough.

Mora has tens of billions of people, a Naval base, a class A starport,
and an enviable tech level.  Trillion Credit Squadron says Mora
might be able to churn out 1,000,000+ tons of starship per year,
or 20,000+ tons per week, which can be at least:

1 x 5000t freighter
5 x 1000t freighters
2 x 800t mercenary cruisers
5 x 600t liners
5 x 400t subsidized merchants
5 x 400t patrol ships
4 x 200t far traders
2 x 100t scouts
2 x 100t couriers

This is a conservative number.  I think the system population
actually supports 3 or 4 times this production.  Anyway...

31 ships per week, or 1500 ships per year.  15,000 ships per
decade.  Fifteen thousand ships?  That\'s fine if you have to fill
the shipping lanes from scratch, but is this supposed to be the
replacement rate of an existing interstellar economy?  I don\'t
know... it would be if that was the only functioning class A
starport in the area.  But it isn\'t.  There are gobs of them.  If you\'ve
been on this list long enough, you\'ve seen the raw numbers; truly
staggering.  On the average, I\'d say a subsector will have a
build potential of several million tons per year.  This is overkill,
and not profitable to the starports.  Thus this number is only
a potential, and only meaningful in full-tilt wartime production.


Bottom line: shipbuilding is tied to demand; in fact, it may be
slightly less than demand.  And demand is tied to trade, of
course.  The question is how?

One we know that the demands on Mora\'s shipyards are X
ships per year, then we start to get an idea of how the load
is distributed.  It won\'t be nearly as industrialized as you may
think: robotic factories (especially high tech ones) are expensive,
so you want to buy only what you need, with little extra (unless
the Navy subsidizes you) and you want to run those robots as
often as possible, with plenty of maintenance breaks.  I\'d say
no civilian starship will be completed in under a month.  In
fact, I\'d say High Guard/CT have reasonable build times.

But if your starport is on a smaller world, then expect delays.
If they don\'t have delays, then I\'d suspect that they are a
secret Zhodani base.

It looks basically correct with one minor error. Burroughs gave permission
for use of the title (as evidenced in the ending credits). Scott has never
mentioned Nourse in any interviews I\'ve read. But since Burroughs based his
work on Nourse\'s, that\'s where the term really comes from.

Really? That\'s interesting. I wonder if it\'s true?

I agree. In RPGs it plays a big factor. If the players and GMs aren\'t on the
same page it can create some serious difficulties.

Very true, although it is in my own "great film" category for a number of
reasons, few of which are relevant to the discussion or the mailing list.

Almost always, but I learned when running Traveller that I have to run
things fast, loose and off-the-cuff. In other RPGs it\'s easy to plan for
certain contingencies. In Traveller, however, especially in the settings
that I like to run and my players like to play (high-pop, well established
worlds) you can never plan more than a session or two in advance.

That\'s why I keep lists... Pages and pages of lists. I\'ve got Vilani names,
Aslan names, multicultural Terran names, ship names and city names. I\'ve got
lists of NPCs, lists of simple plot elements, lists everywhere. In a "fast
and loose" game, this stuff is pretty much required and makes things run so
much better.

It\'s so much easier when you can just look at a list and work out all the
little details of a side trip.

I have a vague recollection (and no saved msg to back it up!) of a thread
about this some time ago on this list...  Unless the thread was a joke
(and, if so, I was taken in by it!), wasn\'t Blade Runner the anglicization
of something or other in German that had something only peripherally to do

It was a novel by an author I can\'t remember where medical treatment was
tightly controlled. The ultimate end to Medicare and the government control
of the medical system. (this was written in the sixties, remember). A "Blade
Runner" was a person who provided illegal medical supplies to doctors
working illegally in the underground to give unauthorized patients medical
care. The "Blade" was a scalpel. the "Runner" the illegal provider.

GURPS already has this built in, (as an optional rule, of course.)  Most
skills have a default skill level. Related skills default higher. For
instance a gunnery (Beam Weapon/TL9) skill will default to a certain value
for gunnery (Beam Weapon/TL12) to compensate for the gunner\'s unfamiliarity
with the weapon.

Character templates already lump together certain skills for a specific
character type. For instance Belter (G:T p88) or merchant (G:T p97). And
some skills can be defaulted high enough not to even require a skill roll
under most circumstances, as in driving(auto) skill for a 20th century
American or (probably) grav sled for a Imperial 12th century Core resident.

I wonder if you could create a bunch of very large, possibly weak, meson
screens and use them to detect the direction from which meson strikes are
coming?  If you had a lot of them positioned all over the planet with,
say, 1000 km radii overlapping, and they could detect where meson strikes
went through them (not sure about that), this would go a long way to
determining where the shooter was.  Once you\'ve got a general idea, you
hem it in with more meson screens and other conventional sensors.

Also, punitive counter-measures are a cruel but often effective tactic
once you\'ve got orbital superiority: "If you take out one of our bases
with a submarine meson gun, we orbitally bombard 10 of your major
population centers."

Finally, I think some folks are over-estimating the ability of people to
"call in" meson fire.  Someone mentioned a guy with binocs and a compass. 
If I had that, I would have exactly no idea how to call in a set of
coordinates.  The problem would only get worse in a society where people
typically "dial-a-destination" in their grav vehicles.  Military personel
could do it, of course, but you wouldn\'t have to "capture every comm unit

A shipyard will have as its goal to be in constant use.  No down time.
Down time sucks money and cuts profits.  So, the reasonably prudent
shipyard will design itself with capacity to handle whatever demand
there is, on whatever time frame it operates (IMO, quarterly shareholder
profits won\'t be as driving a force as it is now, but 2, 3 or even 5 year
profits will be the measuring stick).

Pumping up production capacity is costly, but if circumstances warrant
and the economies of scale for production costs is there, it can be done.
I think this will vary by area of the Imperium.  If I had a shipyard in the
Spinward Marches, I\'d want to have excess capacity of 15% in case
of war, trade boon, etc.  But in Core, I wouldn\'t want any at all.

Because people that accept that don\'t argue the point.  Since we don\'t
accept that, we do argue the point.

The reason I question all this stuff has nothing to do with normal uses of
technology, its the unusual uses and implications that interest me.  For
example, if I want to precipitate somebody out of jumpspace (perhaps for a
hijacking), what property of a 1 mile diameter body causes the
precipitation?  What small part of a jumpdrive can I damage and have
manufactured on a low tech world?  If the jump drive uses all that fuel at
once, what other technologies can use that kind of energy as well?

But if the tanks are rigid, there\'s not much point in that. They would take
MORE interior space than ordinary interior tanks. And the rules specifically
states that you can\'t use fuel from collapsible tanks directly in the jump
drive (Don\'t ask me why, I don\'t know. But then, I don\'t know how a jump
drive works either.)

Sounds almost like something the Torpedo Sphere from Star Wars:RPG.  It was
designed to do one thing and one thing only:  Destroy a planet\'s defenses.
Perhaps the 3I and her enemies might field something similar, perhaps one
supported squadron per sector or for that matter, Domain.

Here\'s a stunt:
Install collapsible tanks on the outside of the hull.  Use internal tankage for
initial high displacement jump, then pump the fuel into the internal tanks,
collapsing the external tanks and jump again at reduced displacement.   It isn\'t
quite as good as being able to directly use the fuel as per drop tanks, but you
don\'t have to replace the tanks either.  I\'d have to run the numbers but I think
you can do a 2/5 hop or maybe a 1/3/5 hop

Going up "through the ranks" (or as I usually hear it, becoming a Mustang) is 
possible, but the US military academy\'s are limited from ages 17 to 22, 
though it\'s possible to get a waiver (like it is for a number of other 
disqualifying features).

 Though i\'ve never run it, it looks pretty fun and is giving me a good model 
in constructing a similar mission for the post shakedown runs of the RCS

3) Double Adventure 6.  As others have pointed out, has great potential.  It

Paul Walker (tiger@goldinc.com) has some very good rules that are on Andrew 
Vallance\'s webpage and soon to be up on mine (w/ modification).

Basically, my mod\'s would go thus:

Construction time:

> 
> Where: Tc = Construction Time in Years D = Displacement Tons P = Price

and "Trial Time" (for shakedown cruise, etc, which will be the major focus of 
my elaboration/changes).

> Tt=((P*10)/D)/12 
> 
> Where: Tt = Trial time in years P = Price in MCr D = Displacement Tons" 

My changes would go in replacing "Price in MCr" w/ maintenance points, which 
already has a tie in for tech level, as IMO should be a factor.

Aw, but it\'s easier to declare them, by fiat, impossible or catastrophically 
destructive to the Traveller Universe (though the economic analysis of Far 
Trader would indicate quite the opposite).  
 
I prefer to rationalize or find an interesting reason for the quirky and 
sometimes cheesy things (especially like Beyond sector, etc) in Traveller\'s 
history. :-)

Just to add to your point:

Wouldn\'t a collapsable tank (flexible tank) be subject to micrometeorites
and other things floating in space? Wouldn\'t be good to have your fuel
bladder popped as your preparing to jump. I feel if your going to put the
tanks on the outside, you need to armor them as you would the rest of the
ship. If not, they\'re going to get eaten up and destroyed before you have a
chance to use them. (And they certainly won\'t survive a fire fight)

Careful, the chargen system is not meant to be representative of the general 
population (i believe this was explicitly stated?), but represents 
"Travellers" (the wealthy, the nobility, the riff-raff w/o roots, etc).

Your Imperium is far different from teh Imperium of canon (and sectors from 
the thing in M:0), where the credit and commerce is the bottom line.  The 
only thing off limits is slavery, weapons of mass destruction and piracy.  
Hell, govts which oppress *everyone* are given the wink and nod and even the 
support of the Imperial Marines, as long as they pay their taxes and support 
the nobility (which is hardly a rule by law, but a rule by men, err... 
sophonts)...

This issue, amongst others, is dependant on many issues (religion, morality, 
etc) that\'ll probably only end up in huge flame wars.  I\'m game, though...

I assume that it\'s the Latin preposition "ob", so the phrase means
"toward Traveller", or "for the sake of Traveller".  Maybe it\'s an
abbreviation for "obiter", "by the way of".

Which Vargr language?  I think Gvegh is the most common language in the
Vargr Extents by 1100 (and probably was in Milieu 0), but there are of
course at least thousands of Vargr languages.  Of course, Gvegh would
also be the most common Vargr language used in the Imperium.

This isn\'t official or anything, but some folks have started using
GTL and TTL to indicate GURPS Tech Level and Traveller Tech Level.

Personally, I think we could just use GTL-9 and TL-10 and be
understood on *this* list, Okay.

  That\'s from K.W. Jeters novel "Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human" -

  HG/TCS appears to make the distinction that rigid is required for the
quick emptying Jump requires; collapsible tanks fail that test.

  Therefore, what we need are _folding_ external tanks :)

Ok, fair point, but then if someone could teach you how to read a map in an
hour, how long is it going to take to teach an average citezen of a high tech
world to use a compas and read a map. A day, two perhaps ?

I imagine something like that; a rectangular tank with 4
accordion-folding walls and a rigid \'bottom\' (the bottom is the side
furthest from the hull). Fuel is pumped out of the tanks by the
collapsing process as a motor pulls the \'bottom\' to the hull, and by the
time the ship actually jumps, the external tanks are empty and flush
with the hull. These tanks could empty as quickly as the connecting
pipes allow.

The fact that you can extend your empty tanks and make pretty good
spaced armor to defeat HEAT warheads is just an unintended bonus... :)

What if the target designators were entirely automatic units with some
kind of navigation hardware (GPS equivalent, using ground transmitters,
stellar observations, intertial navigation, or Clarkeian technomagic)
and a laser rangefinder? Your spotters only have to point and push the
button, and the target location is computed and stored, or transmitted
immediately to the meson gunners.

Just hand a bunch of them to your resistance cadres before the invasion
begins, or build them into cameras that transmit the picture with the
location, and give *everybody* one.

Real military FOs could have theirs /directly/ linked to the meson
gun. Point-click-kaboom on anything they can see.

Doing battle in a meson-gun environment must be terrifying. At least
with regular artillery you can dig a hole if the first one doesn\'t get
you; if They have meson guns and decide to target you, you\'re
dead. (meson screens help, but they can\'t protect everyone all the time)

I don\'t expect a flame war on this subject.

We were talking about species and gender in the Traveller era.  The
value of the character generation system for drawing inferences about
the population as a whole, even of the types of citizens produced by the
system, is speculative, as you point out:
 
> Careful, the chargen system is not meant to be representative of the general

> "Travellers" (the wealthy, the nobility, the riff-raff w/o roots, etc).  

Of course, the character generation system is also to be used for
producing at least those NPCs with speaking roles, so it\'s application
is a little broader than just player-characters.

You stated,

> Your Imperium is far different from teh Imperium of canon (and sectors from 

I\'m not sure that\'s true.  I only said that the Imperial services (i.e.,
Navy, Marines, Army, Scouts, Imperial bureaucracy, Imperial diplomatic
corps; maybe there are others) foster a culture that doesn\'t tolerate
species or gender discrimination.  I should clarify (1) that I meant an
internal culture and (2) that I was referring to the post-Civil War
era.  

(1) Within the Navy and the other services, such discrimination is
prohibited by regulations and by the unwritten moral or ethical code of
the service.  This is not altruistic.  The Imperium wants the best and
the brightest to work for the Imperium.  This is one way to get them.  

Note that the Imperium doesn\'t interfere in local culture (at least not
directly; fostering trade and collecting taxes are of course
interferences).  I wasn\'t talking about trying to create an
Imperium-wide culture.  Cleon I tried that in some ways.  He at least
tried to establish Imperial laws that interfered directly with local
governance.  This leads to consideration of time:

(2) Discrimination in favor of Solomani over Vilani in early Imperial
times is well documented in canon.  I\'m sure that wasn\'t the only
action, and I\'m sure it was endemic in the services.  That changed after
the Civil War for a number of reasons, such as the disruption of the
Solomani clique at court, the desire of the Imperial government for
legitimacy after the embarrassing period of the Emperors of the Flag.

The problem with including the computers in the bridge, is that High Guard
has its own computers which are so big that it is possible to assume that
they include the ship\'s sensors.

A bridge without computers, probably has the equivalent of two CP1.0
flight computers (since it cannot jump and counts as computer-0).

The bridge designs in T4\'s Naval Architects Manual were probably 20std.
This was partly due to the full size IMAX screen display and partly 
due to the space needed by the film cameras to track the crew. :-)

More to the point, if there is some equivalent of GPS working, your
concerned citizen\'s computer knows exactly where they are.

Then point a laser at the target and the computer works out range and
relative bearing.

Then press the fire button on your joystick and all the lights on the
planet dim as meson megadeath frys that seagull that just broke the
laser beam. :-)

(The high tech GPS would presumably not use easy to kill satelites)

How many planets are there in the Vargr extents?  Let\'s say 5,000.

It\'s plausible to me that the typical Vargr planet has about the same
density of distinctive languages as contemporary Earth.  Adjusting
downwards by a factor of (say) 1000 for a lower average population than
Earth, let\'s say that\'s 5 languages per planet average.

Maybe around 5,000 Vargr languages in existence at present, not counting
extinct ones.

If you believe good electronic translators are cheap and widespread, then
there\'s little incentive for linguistic spread, and the number of
languages with stable speaker bases could be much higher, maybe by a
factor of ten or so, with there not being \'major\' and \'minor\' languages
to the same degree.

Yes, but saying that there are 5,000 Vargr languages is a lot different
than saying that if you meet 5,000 Vargr they will likely all speak
different languages. What is of most interest is what languages the
average Traveller will encounter, and that means we are only interested in
the range of languages likely to be spoken by Vargr who are far from
home throughout the Imperium.

That statistic is likely to be more uniform. After all, if you grew up on
a world where there were five different human languages spoken, and you
decided that you wanted to go travelling in the Imperium, you\'d really
have to learn Anglic -- the customs inspector doesn\'t speak Turkish,
sorry.

Granted, the diversity of languages is an intersting issue to consider
when the characters visit a Vargr dominated world, but it isn\'t the main
issue in my opinion.

That seems extreme by ship standards, but is that the right analogy?  I

In making those final preparations for my Project: StarRise 
campaign, which kicks off a week from tomorrow (04/21/99), I came 
up with the following character creation information for 
characters designed to start play in 2096AD.  The following worlds 
are available to choose from as homeworlds for characters, as 
determined by OTU canon, my own work, and the ME21 work of both 
Andrew V-M and Rob Eaglestone.  They are presented in the player\'s 
guide MT planetary code format, as that is the rules system under 
which I will be running the game.  I hope you enjoy!

Terra:  Starport A, Large World, Standard Atmosphere, Wet World, Hi
Pop, Balkanized, Mod Law, Early Stellar Tech

Luna:  Starport B, Small World, Vacuum Atmosphere, Desert World, Mod
Pop, Colony World, Extreme Law, Early Stellar Tech

Mars: Spaceport F (Fine quality, non-jump drive maintenance 
possible), Medium World, Trace Atmosphere, Desert World, Mod Pop,
Colony World, Low Law, Early Stellar Tech

Belt: Spaceport F, Asteroid Belt, Mod Pop, Colonies, Extreme Law,
Early Stellar Tech

Ganymede (Jupiter):  Spaceport G (Good quality, no maintenance), Small
World, Vacuum Atmosphere, Desert World, Low Pop, Colony, High Law,
Early Stellar Tech

Callisto (Jupiter):  Spaceport G, Small World, Vacuum Atmosphere,
Desert World, Mod Pop, Colony, Extreme Law, Early Stellar Tech

Titan (Saturn):  Spaceport G, Small World, Exotic Atmosphere, Desert
World, Low Pop, Colony, High Law, Early Stellar Tech

Maximum Number of Terms based on the existence of these colonies:

Terra, Luna: Unlimited, effectively.  (Technically, Luna maxes at 18
terms, but that\'s a heck of a lot of mandatory reinlistments.)

Mars: Max of 10 terms. (Normally not possible or likely, but just in 
case.)

Belt: Max of 8 terms.  (Normally not possible or likely, but just in 
case.)

Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan:  Max of 5 terms.

NOTE:  I am still looking for players interested in a Wednesday night 
game in the Austin area.  If you are interested in joining us, please 
contact me via private email.  If you know of anyone in the area who 
might also be interested, please send them my way.  I would 
appreciate it.

The Movie was (vaguely) based on Phillip K Dicks great book "Do anderoids
dream of electric sheep". The filmguys thought the title was a bit hard to
swallow so they borrowed the title from a book by William Borroughs. It (I
think) was about a future where medicine was outlawed and doctors smuggling
medical supplies were called "blade runners".

Great authors all of them (Dick, Borroughs and Jeter).

I have a question regarding the generation of Terran characters under 
ME21.  I\'m using the MT rules system, and was wondering:

Should I have my PCs create characters using the standard character 
creation system or using the Solomani system under MT\'s AM2: 
Solomani and Aslan?

The Solomani character creation system encompasses a political 
situation similar to how I view the United Nations at the time of 
First Contact.  However, there are significant differences also.  
Thus, I turn to my more learned colleagues on this list and ask, what 
are your thoughts on this matter?

Thanks in advance for your input, and I look forward to your replies.

		Yes, but saying that there are 5,000 Vargr languages is a
lot different
		than saying that if you meet 5,000 Vargr they will likely
all speak
		different languages. What is of most interest is what
languages the
		average Traveller will encounter, and that means we are only
interested in
		the range of languages likely to be spoken by Vargr who are
far from
		home throughout the Imperium.

		That statistic is likely to be more uniform. After all, if
you grew up on
		a world where there were five different human languages
spoken, and you
		decided that you wanted to go travelling in the Imperium,
you\'d really
		have to learn Anglic -- the customs inspector doesn\'t speak
Turkish,
		sorry.

		Granted, the diversity of languages is an intersting issue
to consider
		when the characters visit a Vargr dominated world, but it
isn\'t the main
		issue in my opinion.

communication would develop.  Now if these are the ones exploring space,
then it would reason that that would become a common language.  The next
step is colonization of planets.  Even assuming you took a group that spoke
one of the other languages and settled them on the planet, logic would
dictate they also learned the common space tongue, because who knows if a
trader on the next supply trip speaks your dialect.  I\'m sure many of the
traders would learn local languages as well.  So it doesn\'t seem like each
planet would have 5 entirely different languages.  More than likely, they
would be different dialects.  Perhaps some of the back water planets that
are not visited that often may have evolved their languages into something
similar but still distinctly different.

		How many planets are there in the Vargr extents?  Let\'s say
5,000.

		It\'s plausible to me that the typical Vargr planet has about
the same

Adjusting

What ranks shouls I give the various people aboard the ships? All I "know"
is that you\'re supposedly an officer whenever you command a ship (this seem

I\'m well aware that there probably are no strict rules here

(cybe root of the ships displacement x the number of tatoos of the crew

the number of stars for the commander ;-)

but some general guidelines would be helpful. While I\'am at it lets say I
want to know the ranks of the top crew on an Azhanti as well.

It\'s fairly common for Fleet Air Arm pilots to transfer to ship commands
upon reaching a certain rank. After all, flying a helo is a job for a
subbie or a lieutenant. Driving a warship is a commander or captain.

Well, using no more than TL9 technology:

i. Get a precisely geolocated reference point
(i.e. the dot on the floor in your guerilla cave system is at xx deg
xx\'xx" North, yy deg yy\'yy" East, altitude xxx m ASL.)

ii. Carrying a portable inertial nav box, get to a point overlooking the
target. Read off the display - you now know precisely where you are
standing.

iii. Using a hand laser rangefinder with an integral flux-gate compass,
measure the precise range and bearing to the target (just point it at
the target and press the button). Add this vector onto your location
from (ii) - you now know precisely where the target it.

iv. Call for fire.

v. Retire.

At TL12, all this gear mentioned in (ii) and (iii) will fit in a man
portable, concealable box.

Assuming a reasonable tech level, most cabled comms will have been
replaced by either satellite or meson comms. It\'s easy to turn the
former off...

Today, TL8, it\'s hard to detect a submersible from space. By TL15?
Should be a doddle.

Of course, since your goal was to take population centres, in a couple
of weeks you can start to make your landings near or in occupied cities.
See how willing the defenders are to take out their own cities to stop
you. (Yes, I know it happened in Independence Day, but that was (a) the
USA; and (b) annihilation, not invasion).

It\'s going to be system dependent - since (by the MT system generation
rules) GGs tend to be in fairly distant orbits (and thus have large
rotational periods) you would want the one nearest the mainworld at the
time you\'re invading. It\'s even better if the mainworld happens to be a
satellite of one of the GGs.

I wouldn\'t worry. By TL15, space-based detection of submarines is not

Nah, they\'re not that great for the job. Sure, they can stay on station
for a long time. But traditional airships don\'t go high enough (to use
really long range radars); are excessively vulnerable (slow moving); and
can\'t move fast enough to prosecute a target at a remote datum. In fact,
since airships are averse to the wind, you might not be able to move in
a certain direction at all...

The USN retired all it\'s lighter than air craft a few years ago.

Don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a ship sponsored by a real estate company

I _really_ don\'t want to think about what would happen to this thing
were it hit by a sizeable storm.

It\'d make an interesting simulation project for someone...

Is that TL15 space-based detection of a TL15 stealth sub?  It would 
seem to me that recon improvements at each TL would be met by 
quasi-effective counter-measures at that same TL.  Just my opinion, 
though.  Perhaps the counter-measures would not be so much 
technological in nature as procedural, taking advantage of naturally 
occurring phenomenon to mask or hide the sub from detection.  
Otherwise, submarines would not be used for the same purposes at TL15 
as they are at our current TL.

Okay, I\'ve been dying to ask.  What does this phrase mean, and where
did it originate?  It appears to be a closing phrase of some kind,
but I can\'t place it.  (I hope I\'m not embarrassing myself if it is
part of your name or something.  :)

Capital ships (battleships, carriers and cruisers) should be commanded by
Captains or Commanders, depending on size. There may be flag officers
aboard, especially battleships, but they command the squadron or fleet, not
the ship herself. A Carrier Fighter Wing CO probably has the same rank as
the Carrier CO.

Escorts are probably commanded by Commanders or Lieutenant Commanders. 

Auxiliaries may be commanded by officers of any rank (down to Warrant
Officer, if you have those), depending on size and mission. The CO of a
ship as small as a Gazelle should be a Lieutenant at best.

The Executive Officer on any ship should be one rank lower than the CO.
Department heads (engineering,  weapons, etc.) could be the same rank as
the XO or one rank lower. On the Gazelle, some departments may be led by
chief petty officers rather than commissioned officers.

I think there are canonical answers for some of these (Traders and Gunboats
for the Gazelle, AHL, and Imperial Squadrons come to mind). If someone
would like to correct me, feel free.

Quickest way to find out is to check the one in the Kinunir class scrapped
on the stocks at General\'s Shipyards on Regina

You just have to board the ship, measure out the space that the mounting
takes, and avoid the pouncer using the ship as a lair.

As described in adventure 1, The kinunir.

Q. (and serious).

Did the Whittle Engine (later graciously donated to the US by the UK gov)
have blades? In which case there were aircraft with jets flying in 1945...

Well, another example would be the Bond movie \'Licence to Kill\' which was
originally titled \'Licence Revoked\' before focus group work(?) in the US
suggested that \'revoked\' was not understood...

Was the French version subtitled or dubbed? ;)

Sounds correct to me. TL is CT, MT, TNE and T4 GTL is GURPS Trav. GURPS is
an official varient with a limited TL resolution so we use TL in non-GURPS
terms.

that\'s good, but the navy muddies up the waters a bit. They don\'t always 
asign a full captain to a ship. A smaller ship will have a commanding officer 
of a lower rank. Take the Gazelle for an example. She only has a crew of 
10-12 (depending on which set of rules you use). I would make the "skipper" a 
Lt. , and the other 2-3 officers either Lt. jgs. (sub Lts. to the non yanks 
on the list...) or ensigns. The enlisted crew would be one senior NCO (petty 
officer; prob. a chief PO), and the rest would be jr. PO\'s and 
ratings...Therefore it\'s possible to have a Lt. or even an ensign as a 
"Captain" of a vessel, and a Captain assigned to a staff postion with no 
command authority.

I would give the skipper of the Lisani a rank of anywhere from Lt. Commander 
up to Captain, depending on the size of the ship and crew. I use a crew size 
of at least 400-500 to require to CO to be a Captain, as the equiv. land rank 
is Colonel, and he/she commands at LEAST a battalion sized billet...

Captain is both a rank and a position. The position is also called CO
(Commanding Officer).  They are equal on Destroyers (sometimes a
commander is CO) through Capital ships (sometimes a Commodor is CO).
The CO is addressed as Captain no matter what his rank is when aboard
ship.

The US Navy does not use Commodore except in time of war so some
officers are held back (remain at the rank of Captain) while others are
promoted past Commodore.  The squadron commander for the Destroyer
Squadron I was with was a Captain by rank but was addresses as
Commodore, supposably had in time of war had automatic promotion to
Commodore.

No, once one meson gun has fired 3 times it can be triangulated on IF the
targeted site can be examined.  This would not apply for mobile targets as
the angle of the attack could nt be easily determined but with things like
building it should be doable after three shot per weapon.

If you have 12 meson site then after at most 25 shots one of those sites
will be locatable.

IMO, it\'s really just flexed over there.  The NPC templates in TNE are more 
appropriate IMO.  Not the width of experience or skill of a PC.  Now 
"detailed NPCs" are basically just PCs controlled by the ref.  TNE\'s, btw, is 
IMO the most capable of populace construction w/ mundane jobs (construction 
worker, etc), in addition to the military and adventuring types.

We know there\'s the major/minor race thing.  Even the hick thing w/ the 
attitude given towards the Marches by the Core (it\'s mentioned in RSB,though 
I\'m not sure if it is elsewhere).

I can see that, but there\'s supposed to be some pretty severe discipline and 
cautions against mutiny, etc that are more reminiscent of the age of sail 
rather than modern naval warships (in particular, the gazelle).  It\'s almost 
like the spacehands are conscripts.  Not that I think that should be, or 
necessarily is, the case but that\'s the feel I get.

I\'d substitute *seems* for *is* in the first line, but the rest of it seems 
pretty much straight on.  IMO.  YMMV.

Hmm.. I\'ve only looked at Freedom Ship so far.  Would this be better in

milieu?  The possibilities are really endless.  Thanks for posting it.

Someone (either Annti or Idiot/Savant, I think) on the TNE-RCES list had that 
idea bout a year ago to explain the weapons on the Lancer DD\'s IIRC (they\'re 
performance in BR indicates TL-15, so were explained as being salvaged from 
submarines on Vras/Aubaine, which is 97% water).  There were other ideas, but 
that was the best.

Depends on how hard integrated use of densitometers and EMS sensors makes it 
to find ships.  It might be too difficult past TL-12, which means those 
things will die fast.  EM Masking and all that in subs... might as well put a 
maneuver drive (would T-plates and/or HEPlaR work underwater?)... and you\'re 
starting to have what looks like a starship (or maybe spacecraft) that 
operates underwater... Then of course, we end up w/ the aircraft/space 
fighter debate that resolves with the only effective difference the insignia 
on the crew uniforms...

Going up "through the ranks" (or as I usually hear it, becoming a Mustang) is 
possible, but the US military academy\'s are limited from ages 17 to 22, 
though it\'s possible to get a waiver (like it is for a number of other 
disqualifying features).
***************
Didn\'t finish...   Plus, I really doubt 28 can get a waiver. Now an Imperial 
Naval Academy might have an older age limit (Vilani blood and all that)...

There are many ways (in the US Military, at least) of getting a commission, 
but the academies are pretty damned hard to get in (on a comparative scale... 
I can give some statistics on academy cadets if anyones interested.  To make 
it to the general staff is almost always restricted to the academy grad\'s (at 
least in fact, if not in theory, though like with everything else, there are 
exceptions).

Well that is a good start.

I for one have always thought that engineering crews were too
large. I have taken to basing them on the cube root of the
engines size instead of linearly.

<Breeeep> <Breeeep>

"Academy Commandant\'s office, how may I direct your call?"

<Scraaaape>

 as the ensign asnwering the phones leaps involuntarily to attention,
shoving their chair out of the way seeing who\'s on the vidscreen.

 "Yes, your majesty! Immediately!" 

Quickly he punches a button on his comm. "Admiral Eneri, an call for
you!"

Admiral Eneri growls: "This had better be import...."

<scraaaape>

"Your Majesty! How may I be of service today."

He listens, and his face grows ashen.

"A thousand apologies, your majesty, I shall rectify that immediately!
His royal highness may report to the Academy at his leisure."

After the Emperor signs off, the Admiral calls his secretary.

"Commander, please ask Admiral Bursky into my office immediately, start

Firstly, it is perfectly possible to make bucketloads of cash with
the Type A - generate a merchant with decent trader and broker skills
and then choose your destinations well.

Secondly, your players sold a Type A, took the profits and bought a
better ship?

I\'m confused.

The Type A is MCr37, the deposit is 20% so if you sell it for the
full market price, you only get MCr7.4 back to act as a deposit on
their next ship. In practice, the bank would want cancellation fees
and the person who buys a secondhand ship would pay less than full
price - so they would make a loss.

Then they buy a "better" ship. Virtually the whole cost of a Type A
is the hull, drives and power plant. So there are no cost savings
to be made. Indeed, without the massive subsidy as a standard design,
the Type A would be MCr52.
You cannot buy a "better" ship without either a lot more cash or
using something like FFS2 to design it.

Bottom line - the Type A is an owner aboard *free trader*. It is not
a freighter. Don\'t use it to tune the freight rules, use it to tune
the speculative cargo rules.

Supplement 7, p18 explains the difference.

So at TL15 the entire device could look like a Star Trek

I think something that powerful needs a "Press Ok to continue"

</Jason>

Another thing to consider is that these subs could, with their bonded
super-dense hulls, go much deeper than today\'s subs.  It\'s going to be
hard to detect something under a couple of kilometers of water at any TL. 
(This is the part where we get into an endless debate about the
capabilities of far-future sensors:  What\'s the range of a densitometer,
what resolution time would an EMS array need relative to the sub\'s
movement speed, etc, etc, etc. :-) 

With regards to the question of calling meson fire, alot of people have
brought up the idea of using high-tech equipment to make it easier for joe
average to help out the resistance.  I wasn\'t thinking of such organized
forces.  If you have time and resources to set up a resistance and hand
out the inertial compasses, laser range-finders, meson communicators and
so on, that would make your planet extremely costly to hold (except for
the punitive measures maneuver if it worked) but that depends on the
individual situation.  Anyone using regular broadcast radio comm would be
subject to orbital bombardment, I think.  As invader, I\'d tell the
populace "broadcast and be blasted".  Also, it would be majorly important
to take out the GPS systems (orbital or ground-based) and non-broadcast
communications systems.

There is a ref to the Seige of Gashikan in -1658 Imperial where the Vargr

Ok, so we\'re reducing all comm and power grid systems to rubble,
whacking anyone using a cell phone with orbital deadfall, scragging the
starport and sensor grids.

At this point you\'ve reduced the planet at least two TL\'s if not more,
killed a _major_ chunk of the population, and generally made the place a
nasty little hellhole full of anti-Imperial terrorists by the time
you\'re done...

Remind me, what exactly did you _want_ to invade this planet for????

Might as well just stand off and lob rocks, nukes and CBW\'s at it. At
least _then_ you can sit in airconditioned comfort on your BB\'s...

Yes, in a roundabout sort of way.  What I\'ve been working on is a body
of rules to Travellerize Iron Crown\'s game "Silent Death", which is
quite suited to the S:AAB setting.  I don\'t yet have my rules written
down, but I\'ll try to put something together in the next couple of days.

(For those who haven\'t played it, Silent Death is a starfighter combat
game, about a step-and-a-half above beer-and-pretzel gaming.  Great fun,
and far more suited to a S:AAB-style game than any of Traveller\'s
starship combat systems.  Not nearly as _realistic_, but much more
evocative of the fast-paced action of a dogfight.)

>For some reason.... I just suddenly thought of Megatron and Optimus Prime.

Excuse me if I warm up an old fashioned idea - (Newbee is talking -grin )
BUT 
I feel it would be good old Traveller style if service tanker - non jumpable 
Spaceships - are waiting for customers at astrographical gaps. 

" Free Trader Gilgamesh, here tanker Puffin Blue,
 Got your contract from Hyper-Hydro Union and awaits you at jump point at 
 0900, over "

Hyper Hydro Union is a agency that organises assisted long-leapes from 
Bendor (Spinward Marches 2326) to Ffudn or Squanine - connecting the 
Glisten-Tail of the Spinward main with the Tirem cluster and the Dodds 
cluster.

" Tanker Puffin Blue here Free Trader Gilgamesh. All systems green for
 marriage. Feed us Mother "
 
The Free traders make a rendevou with the Tanker, initiate the pre-jump 
process, take the fuel from the tanker,  get hastily divorced and jump with 
full tanks to there destination.

" Free trader Gilgamesh here Tanker Puffin Blue. Disconnektion in ten seconds.
Diskonnektion 5,4,3,2,1, Now. Have a good jump and happy honneymoon. Over"

This service gives employment for some spaceship crews and can hide some 
adventures for the free trader crews. 

- - waiting for the rendevous the free trader Ulixe receives an emergency call 
of 
the overdue tanker
- - in the hug of the ships some highjackers from the tanker are knocking at 
the 
door (blowing the air locks after blocking the turrets)
- - Before the Free Trader Kilean could afford the repaits at the jump drives, 
the 
crew earned some credits by giving ferry services or so. 

Under this point of view the idea of longer legs for free traders becomes a 
source for old traveler flavor and good stories. And in my oppinion good 
stories 
are the reason for playing traveller.

The players want longer legs ? Ok there is this service. No problems with 
sreamlining the hull, No problems with getting the technical licence of all 
the 
wonderfull impersonall buerocratians on the way (" This is no standart tank. 
This tank is build for high fuctual hydrogenium. Sorry without technical 
license we have to moth your ship in because you are a danger for our orbital 
passage " )

If the players need such a device only one time let the players build it and 
loose 
it at the jump.

" Tanker Puffin Blue here Free Trader Gilgamesh. See you at the oher side. 
Over and out "

Looking at a modern wet navy:

A small ship - say a mine countermeasures vessel - might be commanded by
a lieutenant or a lieutenant commander.

An escort - a frigate or destroyer with a crew of 100-200 - or a
submarine (with a crew of 100) would be commanded by a Commander.

A capital ship - an aircraft carrier - would be commanded by a Captain.

Considering how hard it is to actually *train* people for command,
you\'re unlikely to see an Ensign (or Sublieutenant) in command of a
ship. Since the ship might be detached for independent duty, it\'s be too
much to ask for some scroat fresh out of the academy. OTOH, it\'s quite
reasonable for the chief engineer to be a senior NCO on a minor warship
rather than a junior officer in the engineering branch.

Also, considering that a starship might have to stand watches, you\'re
looking at a minimum of two or (preferably) three `officers of the day.\'
Depending on YTU, these may or may not include NCOs.

Naval commands, in terms of number of personnel, tend to be smaller than
land commands. In terms of importance - would you rather lose a regiment
of troops (a Colonel\'s command) or a carrier (a Captain\'s command)?

There are a number of problem here. No matter what you do, a TL15
submarine is going to displace its own volume of water when submerged
from the water column. Recent media speculation is that France has
developed a method for sensing this displacement from high
altitude/space. There are also any number of other signatures (acoustic,
magnetic, thermal to name three) that are never going to go away; but
are going to become more and more vulnerable to detection at the TL
increases.

The strict translation is `to conquer the upper air\'. The normal
translation is `to conquer the ether\' - as in the old medium for the
propagation of radio waves. It\'s the motto from the crest of the first
unit I worked for - the RAF Signals Engineering Establishment, at RAF

The *exact* alloy used today probably wasn\'t available (in airframe &

Yep, the Whittle engine had a compressor. I think the point is that,
when you tried to build a 450 seat aircraft in 1959, you failed. Today,
Boeing runs them off the line, and the crash merchants at Airbus are
looking at 900-1000 seaters.

\'fraid I must disagree.  There were Commodore\'s in the fleet as recently as
1985 (she was the ranking officer at Great Lakes RTC/NTC - believe me, I
remember her rank!)  In \'87 (?), Commodores were converted to Rear Admiral
(lower half).  While I don\'t pay attention to it anymore, I believe that
currently the rank of Rear Admiral still spans two pay grades.

In any case, no Admiral commands a single ship, even carriers.  Captain is
the highest rank for shipboard command (tho\' it may not seem that way when
the Admiral is embarked.)  Again, tho\' - I\'m out of the fleet and haven\'t
set foot on non-skid since I left the Nimitz in \'92.

While I can see a 04 commanding a Gazelle, it would either be a hotshot
promoted during his tour, or a ROAD* slug backwatered to keep the rest of
the fleet safe.  I think the majority of them would be in the hands of O3\'s
(LT) with either a O2 (LTjg) or maybe a O1 (ENS) as an XO.

On that topic, I can kind of see the following breakdown:

O1 - OIC of small boats (sub 50 dTon range.)
O2 - OIC of light, armed spacecraft (sub 200 dTon.)
O3 - Commands space- and star- craft ranging in size from 100 dton to 999
dtons.  Lowest rank to jump-capable commands.
O4 - Commands smaller space- and star- ships ranging from 1000 dtons to
10000 dtons, but not mounting spinal weaponry (Destroyers, Frigates,
Escorts.)
O5 - Commands warships with spinal weaponry (Cruisers)
O6 - Commands large warships (Carriers, BBs, DNs.)

        I know that there is a canon reference that the Vargr glassed one of
their own worlds after the Hivers "maipulated" it to the acceptance of using
sauces and flavorings on meats.  Apparently this is major heresy for Vargr....
        Also, the K\'Kree in a JTAS article explicitly indicate *they* have
no difficulty genociding a predator race.

        In 1944 Mescherschmitt (sp) had a two-turbine fighter jet in
operation against Allied bomber groups.  Very distinctive looking plane,
with the engines underslung from each wing.  The engines were almost as long
as the fueselage, and it went like a scalded cat.

Yep. The ME-262, probably the best damn air superiority fighter of WWII,
subsequently wasted by Hitler by pressing the squadrons they did have
into tank-busting on the eastern front, instead of taking out the US
bombers.

Also, by the time it was fielded, Germany was hurting big time on
manufacturing capacity, and couldn\'t produce them in the quantities
needed.

That\'s right...  Hitler felt that All fighters were defensive weapons, and
all bombers were offensive weapons.  He refused to allow the 262s to be
made for defense, as he wasn\'t willing to admit that at that point he was
no longer attacking...  Yet another reason the Germans lost... (Although
with the limited industrial capacity at the time, it may not have made any
difference..)

This is no longer true.

For many years the U.S. Navy would advance O-6 (Captains) to paygrade O-7
(Commodore) but frock them to O-8 (Rear Admiral). Frocking is a wonderful
military invention where a person is advanced to a higher rank and given the
responsibilities and privileges of the higher rank but no pay.  This ceased
around 1986 when the Army and Air Force realized that they were outnumbered
at the O-8 level because of the Navy\'s practice.  This meant that the Navy
guy who was frocked to O-8 two years ago, (but was really only a O-7) got
your parking space, even though you made real O-8 (Major General) last year.

So the Navy was compelled to start making Commodores in peacetime. Most got
the same duties they would have originally had as junior Rear Admirals, like
Cruiser-Destroyer Group Commands. Around 1990 or so the name of the one star
rank was changed to Rear Admiral Lower Half, of whom some rather obnoxious
members were referred to by their beleaguered sailors as the Lower Half of a
Rear Admiral.

Ob Traveller:What is the exact Navy Structure in the Imperium?  Has it
change significantly from Meleiu O to 1120?  I understand canon says that
the Navy is organized into Fleets, a certain number for each Domain. The
Archduke of the Domain exercises a certain amount of control over the
Fleets.  But what about the Navy itself? Is there an Admiralty, as in Great
Britain, or is there a looser structure?

Not in the U.S. Navy. It seems not to matter for the most recent crop of
Flag officers right up to CNO. If fact one of them was a Mustang (an
ex-enlisted sailor). Part of this may be because a goodly number of Pilots
and Nuclear Trained Officers now come from either NROTC or OCS. Members of
both cadre are more likely to advance to flag rank than some Academy grad
who specializes in Poli Sci.

Does the Imperial Navy get all it\'s officers though a central Naval Academy,
or are there other military schools, perhaps in some of the Domain capitals
that provide an alternative path to Navy Commission? During wartime does the
Navy sometimes commission commercial spacemen, as both the U.S. and Royal
Navy did during W.W.II?

I understand the principal of commodoreship, but didn\'t realize that in the
USN, it equated to a paygrade...  I thought an 07/G1 was a rear admiral of
the lower half (or something like that...)  Is that to say that naval
officers passing from 06 to 08/G2 are, in between, 07/G1 Commodores?

I read it as that Strephon didn\'t actually hate Lucan (prior to the
assassination), more he ignored him. However the point is not to meet
Lucan\'s wishes, but to drill some disipline into the spoilt brat (which is why
the Marines and not the Navy).

In the past, yes.  It used to be that Captains (O6) were promoted to
Commodore (O7) and then effectively given an acting rank to Rear Admiral
(O8), but with the pay of an O7.  What happens now is that Captains are
promoted to Rear Admiral, Lower Half (O7) and then to Rear Admiral, Upper
Half (O8) sometime later, each being a distinct pay grade.

However, this system appears to be unique to the US Navy (thank goodness). 

I believe the Royal Navy has recently reinstituted the rank of Commodore as
an actual rank/paygrade; in the past they had gone direct from Captain to
Rear Admiral, with senior captains being appointed to positions as
Commodores without a permanent change in rank.

I may have overstepped there as I have never been on a Carrier.  In \'83
we had a Captain thet was called Commodore. The only CO of a carrier I
knew of while I was in was a Rear Admiral (2 stars), but he may have
been just promoted and awaiting his replacement (or he was
misidentified?)

On Destroyers (325 crew) the CO came aboard as a Commander and was
transfered after being promoted to Captain.

In my experience, not much.  The GDW Scout book is *far* superior.  I have
unfond memories of using that book back in the 80s and while trying to
generate ordinary scouts I kept getting PCs with Interrogation 5 and
similar skills.  Blech.

The basic reason is that meson guns big enough to punch reasonable sized

Now, oceans are pretty shallow, so a decent gravitic sensor should let you
pinpoint big lumps of not-water pretty accuratly.

A decent ?neutrino? sensor (y\'know, the one that finds working power
plants) should be able to pick them up from orbit.

Once they are found, they are killed.

Small meson guns can also be countered by meson screens. 

All in all, I think deep meson sites (with biiiiiig battery packs) are the
way to go.

Basically, you will have three numbers, one of which (TL11) will be \'one\'.
The TL 10 designs get a discount of x, the TL9 designs get a discount of y.

Once the TNEC goes to TL12, you have four numbers ...

*shrug* Things you might try include making misjump chances lower with
smaller ships. Perhaps a basic misjump number of 1 in 216 for a 100 dton
ship, 2 in 216 for 200 dtons, 3 in 216 for 300 dtons etc etc etc.

That way, what you win on the swings of scale efficiency you lose on the
roundabouts of increased misjump chances.

How many do exist in canon ? They always struck me as an artifact of the
character design rules ... G:T Far Trader is the first serious attempt at
quantifying the amount of trade in the Imperium, and the theme is Big. Very
big. Seriously lots.

Well, on a 1000 dton HG ship I\'d have a three batteries of doubled triple
lasers and four of single triple sandcasters, for seven gunners (Ditzie
would have a 100 dton PAW bay).

The five engineers is appropriate, because they are in a ship five times
the size. And they get to sleep in shifts, unlike the singlehanded guy on
the A1 (unless he wants to trust the Navigator to wake him up when the
reactor starts to feather).

If it\'s 50 years old, it sure as heck shouldnt cost the sticker price.
Shouldnt be as reliable either ... perhaps -1 to effective skills per 20

Doubled ? I\'m talking fifty thousand a month. Plus performance bonuses

Are these transferable ? If they are Middle Passage vouchers, then perhaps
there might be interest in trading them in for steerage for others ... you
could take the single yourself in a stateroom, or take your wife and kid in
a shared bunk, plus a couple of thousand in cash.

The orginal vouchers could be bundled up, and offered to colonies who need
a Middle Passage ticket for that expensive contractor, in exchange for a
small equity or countertrade consideration.

Innovative financing may also be considered - if you are on a scheduled
run, then do they ever need spare parts shipped in from somewhere ?

The other issue to consider is using the skills of the transferees - if
they are leaving the IN, then they may consider a job offer.

"Why, the carrier, of course," replied Colonel Erik von Oldenburg

Regiment (Jump)].

Seriously, though, that question depends on the mission at hand.  After
all, carriers (either wet navy or space-going) cannot seize and hold
terrain.  OTOH, there are missions that require air power, something
that your average infantry regiment lacks.

That was my point. There had seemd to be an assumption that there was no
difference between a TL6 Jet and a TL8 one.

Now part of the confusion is because our tech levels are only a few decades
apart and its sometimes difficult to appreciate the advances in a field
that you don\'t know in detail. At first glance, Concorde seems more advanced
than a 777, but I\'m sure that those in the know would say that you could use
777 tech to build a better Concorde, but Concorde tech wouldn\'t build a 777.

I\'m guessing here, because everything I know about aircraft design wouldn\'t
be enough to write FFS2, let alone build the real thing. :-)

Forget about massdetectors - use neutrino sensors. They\'ll spot the subs
right away if running on internal fusion power. On the other hand; maybe
they normally run on fuelcells etc to move around and just fire up their
fusion plants when they\'re about to fire.

If it has an hospitable climate, then the population can easily
live there.  They might have to live there at TL3, but they can
still live there and thrive.

If this world has a large and supportable population base, then
the planet can sustain a reasonable tech level as well... even
TL9...

To have a high tech level, though, the world will probably need
to exploit its system resources or trade for them: large deposits
of raw materials that you can strip mine with abandon and not
worry about hurting your world.  Large scale industrialization
is a stepping stone to higher tech levels, yes?

That being said, I suppose there is a special relationship between
asteroid belt mainworlds and nearby agricultural worlds.

Once your system has arrived at TL14, 15, 16, what kind of
trade does it really need to sustain itself?  Darrian didn\'t need
a lot of friends, but I\'m sure it imported raw materials and
still does.  So in closing I\'ll say it can be very helpful to have
3 complementary systems for tech advancement, but a single,
gifted world can do it alone over a longer period of time.

At lower techs, the best defense seems to be the investment of
population in a system. It is very expensive to found a colony and make
it viable. The best worlds ripe for plucking by an adversary are the
ones that are viable and mostly economically independent from the
founding power. Therefore, IMTU, I try to make trade laws reflect the
parent state / colony relationship. 

The colonizing power should maintain a large garrison in the system
especially if it is a frontier world. Colonial militias are organized to
resist invading forces until the fleet can arrive with a counter attack.
Extensive use of grav vehicles armed with fusion guns and tactical nukes
would be used to resist. 

The important thing is to make sure the planet population is loyal to
the colonizing empire and does not want to switch sides.

What else can be done on a lower tech world (say 10 to 12) to prevent
invasion?

    'body' => '#1: Twilights Peak

Played as a campaign lasting over a year (the hunt for the octagon) with a
grand finale (the Zhodani raid on the alien base), then springboarded into
another campaign of espionage during the Fifth Frontier War (Zhodani
Intelligence was convinced the players were Imperial superspies, because
they singlehandedly destroyed an advance base, so made them a prime target
for neutralization).  Two years of fun from a little adventure was a great
deal!


#2: Murder on Arcturus Station/Safari Ship (tie)

Never played either one as a full adventure, but they did a good job of
modelling non-military adventures at a time when most other games
concentrated on shoot-em-ups. Pulled elements from both into my ongoing
campaign.


#3: Shadows

A great adventure for introducing people to Traveller at clubs and
conventions. It does resemble a dungeon crawl, but with the right
atmosphere (no pun intended) the players really get the feel of a science
fiction game. I always used fluorine for the insidious atmosphere - nasty
stuff, especially when it gets in your suit. Also gave me a chance for a
quick chemistry lesson on proper materials handling! :-)

(I put 25mm plans of the alien complex at
<www.geocities.com/Area51/Nebula/9135>, sectioned off into chambers so
that they can be laid on the table as the players explore the complex. The
visuals work well with younger kids, say 10-15.)



I deliberately haven\'t listed the DGP adventures, partly because they were
uniformly good, and partly because they are not available for GURPS use
(dispute with Roger Sanger, I think) and so will almost certainly get
contradicted down the line...

	I agree with you up to the point where you say 3 worlds are helpful 
but a single world can do it if they really want.  
      Far Trader is of the opinion that it takes at least many sectors to 
support a GTL-12/TTL-15 infrastructure.  This may be partly self-serving in 
that it makes trade very important, but I think this is critical to the 
Traveller background.  If trade across very wide areas is _not_ critical to 
the support of tech levels above GTL-8/TTL-8 then it becomes difficult to 
see why the canonical tech level drop of the Long Night and Hard Times 
occured when trade was cut off.  Also, if trade doesn\'t need to occur across 
long distances, then there is no economic basis for the Imperium.

      Darrian is obviously the fly in this ointment, but I think we can 
somewhat explain it away.  AM8-Darrian tells us that pre-Maghiz Darrian 
society was totally absorbed in science, with nearly every person working on 
their own research.  We can also assume from this that Darrian did not have 
much of a "consumer culture" because their world was so gentle, social 
status was conferred by good research rather than material possesions, and 
they were simply more interested in science than creature comforts.  This 
would free up a lot of people for advancing the frontiers of knowledge that 
might otherwise have been busy marketing plush toys and so on.  If we say 
that the Darrians had GTL-13/TTL-16 technical knowledge but perhaps not 
large industrial capability, things are also easier because this means a 
smaller committment of physical resources would be required.  If we need 
even further qualifications, we can say that Darrian knowledge wasn\'t evenly 
spread, but was focused in the physical sciences (hence the ships and star 
trigger).

"Bladerunner" comes from the work of surgeon, SF author Alan E. Nourse,
who is credited in the BR movie credits. His work is pretty scary about
a world where people without HMO\'s are denied medical care and the care
those who have it is substandard. "Bladerunners" perform medical
services off the clock, which is very illegal. The novel is an attack
both on socialized medicine and private insurance. The Bladerunner

That cornea thing was also done in Star Trek TNG.  Some chick was using

To be fiar, I\'m a city boy, and was taught land navigation to the point of
being able to find my way from point to point on a moonless night using
only a map and compass.  That training took about two weeks.

From what I understand, the Infantry School still teaches land nav despite
the easy avalibility of GPS.  This is because, in the immortal words of 1SG
Dollar, "shit breaks."

Today\'s Army has a laser designator that hooks into the GPS.  It knows
where it is, and then it knows the precise bearing and range to the target,
so it can uplink the taget\'s location to any interested unit.  Take three
readings, and it\'ll give you velocity and heading information.

IMTU, there is one Naval Academy per Sector (more or less).  The Spinward
Marches Academy is located at Macine Belt.  Marines don\'t have an Academy.
All Marines enlist as regular Armsmen, and after their first few years of
service, may be invited to attend OCS.  This insures that all Marine
officers understand what they are asking their troops to do, and that the
enlisted Marines know that their officers aren\'t blind to their concerns.

One thing I\'ve always wanted to do was a Navy based on the Age of Sail
Royal Navy.  Midshipmen, Lieutenants, and Captains.  That\'s it.

the advantage to taking the existing downport is that the defenders are
probably going to be unwillingly to utterly destroy several billion credits
worth of infrastructure.  A build your own downport is going to attract
every attempt to utterly destroy it.

Grabbing the world\'s downport also gives you all that nice infrastucture

Um...only if the resolution is quite good.  By and large, submarines have the

However, given that this isn\'t used to kill buried meson guns, presumably the

Actually, moderately deep meson sites with connections to the urban power grid

Given that it\'s a meson comm - how do you know that it\'s broadcast?
Anyway, distributing them to a few people is no problem. Giving one to
*everybody* is no more difficult than, say, giving everyone in WWII
England a gas mask.

That\'s why I suggested a precisely known fixed reference and inertial
system. It\'s self contained, needing no GPS system.

Shame.  Slow roasted K\'Kree over a charcoal fire and basted with a good
sauce might be a hot item on the Vargr worlds.  And I\'m sure some
industrious young Barker would use the hooves for Jello or glue.

Yes. \'Till recently, you went from the top of the Captain\'s List to Rear
Admiral (Rank - Paygrade is a USN term). However, if you were in one of
a number of `one star\' appointments as a Captain, you were frocked as a
Commodore (Example: Commodore, Amphibious Warfare - the head of the
amphibious part of the RN). 

However, with the drive to `jointness\' between the three forces, and the
number of naval officers in essentially civilian parts of the MoD (like
the Procurement Executive as was), it was decided to reinstate the rank
of Commodore. It is still possible to skip it, though (IIRC).

Well, a regiment of jump troops can be replaced in seventeen years by
the part-time efforts of unskilled labour. OTOH, replacing that carrier
is going to be harder.

Let\'s look at it this way: There\'s an Imperial Regiment planetside.
There\'s a battleship in orbit that can pick up the troops and save them
from an imminent plastering by the big hostile fleet that just jumped
insystem - it\'ll take two days to pick them all up. However, the
battleship has just received, via fleet courier, news that a disabled
carrier one jump away is likely to come under attack in eight days.

Jump now and save the carrier; pick up the troops and lose it?

  I happen to agree, but it could be pointed out that magnetic anomaly

Not exactly - the two particle streams intersect and produce 
mesons, which then go off to the target and decay into high 
energy photons (aka x-rays or gamma rays). 

(Mesons ordinarily decay almost instantaneously, but as per 
HG, when accelerated to high (relativistic) speeds, they can 
last long enough to reach their target. Along they way, they 
don\'t interact with other particles much, so not much can stop 
them. (I\'m not enough of a physicist to know if mesons can 
really go through the bulk of a planet - anyone else?))

If the intersection of the beams created the explosion, meson
guns couldn\'t fire through stuff as per canon - the particle
streams wouldn\'t pass through. 

If you set up the particle streams in such a way that they 
tended to create slow mesons, the mesons would decay at (or 
very near to) the point of the intersection, but since you\'d 
already have two particle beam weapons able to fire at that 
spot, you wouldn\'t need the mesons. 

This is just a guess, but I also imagine that you\'d need to 
hit the particle beams together at a narrow angle to create
mesons going precisely fast in a precise direction.

I believe, but am not certain, that both neutral-particle 
and charged-particle interactions can produce some types
of meson, but I\'m not sure what types are most effective
for blowing up starships. IIRC, CT is silent as to the actual
method of meson production.

Well, the entire meson gun physics is gobbledygook, because decay doesn\'t
behave like that (half-life X means that half of all particles will decay by
time X, not that all the particles suddenly decay at time X).  Aside from that,
mesons should pass through quite large quantities of matter, though traveller
probably overrates how much penetration they actually have (I think mesons
still react to the strong nuclear force, which would give them substantially
lower penetration than neutrinos).

Any particle collision with sufficient available energy to hit the rest mass of
a meson (or more likely, a pair of mesons) can create mesons.  As far as
neutral vs charged, charged particles are realistically much easier to work
with, and there\'s no substantial difference in behavior if you just want to
create mesons.  As far as blowing up starships, for practical purposes all that
matters is the amount of energy.

I thought that was the K\'Kree *not* the Vargr, and was the Hiver
Manipulation which ended the K\'Kree Hiver war? Vargr are GM doggies who eat
meat, K\'Kree are psychotic, militant, xenophobic herbivores who deserve to
be glassed. YMMV on that one ;-)

The G\'naak set the precedent.

Me 262.  Didn\'t turn too well compared to the prop versions if I remember
correctly, but was good against the bombers.

ISTR they had a pilot killing rocket powered one as well (Komet?).

The UK had the Gloucester Meteor which was used to intercept V weapons.

Also I seem to remember that some of the Fw190\'s had 88mm cannon fitted -
is this true?

It was the K\'kree that glassed a world.  Dunno bout them deserving a glassing 
though.  I hear they taste *great* with some teriyaki sauce...

BTW, you forgot \'unrepentant\'.  Whacking out the G\'naak didn\'t bother them at 
all.  They were *PROUD* of that.

Um, the K\'kree *whacked* the G\'naak in a pre-emptive strike.  Seems they didn\'t think they could *ever* be safe around carnivores.  IMNSFBHO, they shoulda got spanked for that.

Methinks it might be time to thin the herds...  <grin>

What country has ever failed to destroy or plan to destroy it\'s ports in
the even of an Invasion? In 1940, the UK would have wrecked Dover as a
port rather than let the Germans capture it intact - cost be damned.

It\'s also why we took two mobile harbours across the Channel with us
during Op. OVERLORD.

I\'m betting that a force big enough to invade a planet has taken out the
GPS constellation - or is at least jamming the life out of it. Hence a
method that is completely self-sufficient.

Slightly less, by preference - that way, if you lose propulsion you
eventually start to rise. But that\'s overall - the large lumps of metal
(like the powerplant) are going to be much denser than the immediate
surroundings. A good hi-pen densiometer should stand a chance of getting
them.

A submerged submarine is probably very close to the same density as water ;) 
Of course, this is because it has some tanks filled with water.

While you have to have _some_ dense areas in a submarine (if nothing else, to
make up for the low-density crew areas), I suspect you could (with careful
design and spacing) construct a submarine where no significant volumes (say, 4
dt or more) would vary from standard density by more than 20%.  Unless a
densitometer has a resolution of < 3 meters (as I recall, you can\'t use a
densitometer to get firing solutions, which suggests a _much_ lower resolution)
it wouldn\'t be able to detect a sub.

Me263, yes a verrah nasty one, that. ISTR the fuel was something like
kerosene and hydrogen peroxide or fuming nitric acid....some sort of
hypergolic, anyway. The thing was mostly fuel tank, and there was only a
thin partition between the pilot and the peroxide tank. NOT fun stuff to
take a bath in.

I think some variants had a 20mm cannon in them, firing through the prop
cone...maybe they made an under belly 88mm pod? The 190, though a rugged
plane, wasn\'t up to firing an 88, I would think. I mean, that was a main
battle tank gun at the time. 

They might have put some in bigger aircraft, like some of the Junkers
twin engine fighter/bombers.

IIRC, some ME109s were equipped with a 30mm cannon that fired through the
"prop cone".

Most certainly.  Perhaps we could get Ditzie to create a K\'Kree zapper so

eaten by Vargr troops after a battle.  In fact, K\'kree are often
referred to by Vargr soldiers as "the prey that shoots back", and there
are many stories of Vargr collecting dead K\'kree soldiers to be skinned,
cleaned, and turned into victory dinners -- and not just when supplies
are low.

"K\'kree, being ungulate herbivores, make an excellent and natural food
for the Vargr; they are considered quite tasty when young, but get
stringy when old (like any ungulate herbivore).  The other major races
don\'t taste as good -- humans and Aslan eat too much meat; Hiver taste
distinctly weird and may be poisonous to Vargr; and Droyne meat is
greasy and tasteless."

At least, that\'s what\'s said in my Traveller universe.

IMO every signature that becomes more vulnerable to detection at higher

You\'re thinking about the Me 163B Komet. The Me 163A
was a trainer version. Quite a few pilots were lost
while landing thanks to that thin partition you
mentions. An excellent website for this thing is at:

According to a friend at DARPA, they\'re working on a set that remembers
where it is, and if the GPS net goes down can keep track of its movements.
yes, the inertial locator is on it\'s way!

They did.

The Focke Wulf 190 packed quite a punch with four 20mm cannons
and two 13mm machine guns. It was slower than the 109, IIRC.
The Me 109 was also the better of the two in terms of turn
radius but it had the annoying habit of losing its wings when
it tried to pull out of a high-G power dive. This was one way
the U.S. P-47 Thunderbolt got away from them.

The best story I\'ve heard about the 109 was actually a story
about the P-47 Thunderbolt (a flying tank). Seems a P-47
was flying home over the Channel when it was bounced by a 109.
The Thunderbolt pilot, being too low on fuel to dogfight,
could only jink somewhat, hunker down in his armored seat,
and just fly for the British coast.

The 109 came up on his tail and let loose from the nose 30mm
for about 15 seconds.

The Thunderbolt kept flying.

The 109\'s pilot let off with a second, 30-second burst from
the 30mm then stopped.

The Thunderbolt kept flying.

The 109 flew off to the side and rear of the P-47 for about
a minute then came up behind a third time and fired for
another 30 seconds.

The Thunderbolt kept flying.

The Me 109 pilot brought his aircraft alongside the P-47,
saluted the Thunderbolt\'s pilot, then peeled off and headed
back for Germany. He had run out of ammo.

The P-47 pilot made it back to his base and landed his aircraft
with two flat tires, about 16 inches missing from one wing, a
largish hole in the other, most of the tail gone, and a frame
ventilated with about 100 holes.

Like I said, a flying tank.

I can\'t believe I forgot that. That does apply even if the 
individual particles are all created simultaneously, yes?

So you just get a line of meson decay, all the energy spread 
out across the space between you and your target and beyond.
Not very useful. One more reason to toss meson weapons out of
MTU, which I did weeks ago anyhow.

So they\'ll penetrate a starship hull okay, but probably can\'t
be fired through a whole planet?

When I started playing Traveller in \'79 I was impressed with Wm. H. Keith\'s
artwork.  He defined the "look" of Traveller for me and I\'m sure a lot of
others.  Sadly, he has not produced anything new for the game since the
early 90\'s.  

Well, now we have a new crop of gamers and I have to tell you that not only
have you inherited his mantle, but IMO you have taken Traveller artwork to
a new high.  

At work today I showed your pics to some co-workers when they asked what
Traveller was.  When they saw them they immediately became interested and
wanted to learn how to play the game.

Well done!

Sound like an interesting scenario.  Does anyone have any K\'Kree warships

For the assault on Europe during WWII, the allies needed a port on the
French coast for rapid logistical support, to test out the idea of capturing
one, (in a nutshell) they sent the Canadians to invade Dieppe in force (it
was a port, relatively "lightly defended" enough for such a foray) which
turned into a dismal failure with valuable machines and equipment lost and
the sad destruction of of the Canadian troops, which would have amounted to
another beachhead at Normandy had they not been so utterly destroyed.

The lessons learnt were:-
1)  That the ARVE equipment, though lost in this folly, did indeed work
successfully.
2)  That the loss of men and equipment would be unreasonable in the assault
on Europe and unacceptable at home.

It was decided by the British that they would build a mobile port and put it
where they liked for use as the allies desired, which worked excellently
(although subject to the violently changing weather of the English Channel.

I would have imagined (though I never had to do it in any Traveller campaign
I ran), that the assaulting forces in such planetary landings would have the
same if not similar problems and would forgo using established "ports"
unless they were walk-overs, and simply land their own "Engineering Ships"
are a suitable location and radiate their attacks out from there?

Ports in low or high TL societies tend to be viewed as some of the most
strategic locations in times of war, and are thusly well guarded and
protected by the owners, and often attacked by the aggressors.  I would
imagine huge open structure starships similar to say, battle riders with
various starport modules that could be carried down to a planet\'s surface by
specialised engineering ships and modular cutters, perhaps even a streamline
rider-like vessel or two that could land as the centre piece/pieces (command
centres) of the port that the modules can be linked to.

Depends on the ruleset and the relative TL\'s. Using the 5FW boardgame, I
needed to concentrate fire from half of one Zho fleet on *one* of the
4518th units to take it to half damage, let alone destroy it. The Sword
Worlders have an even more difficult time - put a few units of the 4518th
on Lanth and that *alone* halts the invading fleets.

Those TL 15 elite grav armoured units are *tough*.

sounds fun, but I thought that the extra ranks developed from this structure

needed...

also, the "rag wagon" RN did have the rank of Commander (for the skippers of

series:

David Weber\'s Honor Harrington Cycle and  David Feintuch\'s "Nick
Seafort" Series

Honor Harrington: On Basilisk Station, Honor of the Queen,  The Short
Victorious War, Field of Dishonor,  Flag in Exile,  Honor Among Enemies,
In Enemy Hands, Echoes of Honor, More Than Honor (Collection, a must
have, author\'s article on Honor\'s universe should be read before reading
the series), World\'s of Honor (Collection , mostly about Honor\'s
treecat)

Nick Seafort: Midshipman\'s Hope, Challenger\'s Hope, Prisoner\'s Hope,
Fisherman\'s Hope, and Voices of Hope.

Of course you need to read all the C. S. Forester Hornblower novels, and
watch the A&E series (buy the videos), also reading the Patrick O\'brian
Aubrey Maturin novels, starting with "Post Captain" wouldn\'t hurt
either. Or Alexander Kent (aka Dudley Pope of \'Ramage\' fame) and his
hero Richard Bolitho. Or Phillip McCutchan\'s Halfhyde series ( late
victorian, pre dreadnought navy). Or Dewey Lambdin\'s Alex Lewrie
adventures (Tom Jones and Flashman meet Hornblower, a very bawdy set
sir!)

There are several Honor Harrington conversions for GZG\'s Full Thrust
available on the internet. E-mail me for the web sites. There is of
course David Weber and Honor Harrington websites up the yin yang, most
aren\'t very good.

Honor Harrington brings the feel of Nelsonian/Napoleonic british royal
navy "feel" to a future setting. Although in my strict opinion it\'s more
like the Georgian Navy (that\'s KIng George\'s I & II). My wife reads them
and she hates the "military s-f" genre (most of it\'s crap--she\'s right)
and I\'d agree with her that they are borderline literary like O\'brian\'s
work. In Honor\'s universe war is real, violent, disgusting, but
necessary and  (duck!) honourable; bureaucracy, especially admiralty
politics is of course them same in this timeframe  as it was in
Hornblower or Bolitho\'s time. Honor is four-dimensional, and is one of
the best developed characters in  SF. She is as real as Henri was in War
& Peace. She is also the strongest female character ever written by a
male SF writer this side of Heinlen\'s "Friday". A lot of people think
David Weber is a pseudonym of a female ex-navy author. David Weber, whom
I\'ve met is very real, and has never served a day in the Navy, except as
an Admiral in "Starfire" (excellent counterpoint to "Fullthrust"), which
by the way he co-authored with Steve White, another good military SF
writer.

David Feintuch\'s Nick Seafort series is almost as good as Weber\'s but
Seafort is more insecure than the young Hornblower and somewhat
neurotic. The plots are almost straight out of nautical fiction without
much effort to translate them to a future setting. This series has more
luck and sheer coincidences in the plot to outdo your typical Men\'s\'
Adventure series (Mac Bolan et al) or Regency Romances, never-the-less,
I would have killed for these books when I was fourteen because I felt
just like the seventeen year old Seafort, insecure, shy, and a little
bit to reticent to prove myself (hey, that\'s me now!!!) Hornblower
considered himself lucky, Seafort, damned/fated, but both won out
through intellect and courage.

OT: The Imperial Navy in the Third Imperium is more SNAFUed than the one
Honor serves in, it\'s larger and has over a thousand years to repeat the
same mistakes over and over and over again. Just imagine an admiralty a
thousand years old built on a ideal already three thousand years old.
Nelson\'s admiralty was a piece o\' cake compared to Strephon\'s! Marines
and Navy carry cutlasses because the Bureau of Ordinance hasn\'t  revoked
the Article of War requiring their possession and use since it\'s
promulgation in 1738 ad!

  Apparently work was done with some larger calibre recoilless weapons;
probably 37 or 40 mm weapons were the largest high-velocity CPR guns
that most airframes could operate (SWAG).

No, no, no.  Alexander Kent is a nom de plume for Douglas Reeman, who
writes WWII fiction and history under his own name.  Dudley Pope was a
different person (now deceased) who wrote both the Ramage age-of-sail
novels and some histories, both Napoleonic and WWII.

For my money, the Ramage books are probably better adventure fodder; they
have more over the top daring-do than the Bolitho books.

I gave up on these half-way through the first one, when I realized that
Nick Seafort is an idiot and a sadist.  I loathed him, and so did several
other people I know.  YMMV, obviously.  Don\'t buy the whole series; find
the first one used or in the library first.

My understanding of meson guns was that they did their dammage to a
spherical area.  The more powerful the meson gun the larger this sphere
is.  If this is correct [I can\'t find a reference] then you are not
going to be able to tell where the shot came from.  Basically what will 
hapeen is that the meson gun will fire, the mesons will travel through
everything, the target will be reached, the mesons will appear in a
spherical area, and the dammage will be done.  How are you going to be
able to tell what direction the center of this sphere of destruction
came from?

If the meson gun fire were stopped by a meson screen 3 times you might
be able to triangulate based on running diagnostics on your meson screen
to identify where the attacks hit the screen.

There was an adventure published in Third Imperium #5, back in 1987, that
takes place on (and off) this world.  It was about a group of Droyne who
build a starship on their reservation so they can go directly to the
subsector duke to petition him to free them from the reservations and the
local government.

Only one minor problem with this "official" conversion.  On p157 of G:T,
the above is stated for maximum jump capability for that GTL.  GTL 11
should be 5, and GTL 10 should be 4 for converting.

I remember this story well, but don\'t remember the pilot\'s name.  It\'s
in the pilot\'s war memoirs, which were co-written by, of course, Martin
Caidin (who co-wrote a lot of WW2 pilot memoirs).  (I think the book is
entitled "Thunderbolt!")  One interesting detail left out of your story
is that the pilot had chosen not to wear his goggles that day, because
they were awkward and not really necessary in the Thunderbolt\'s closed
cockpit.

Either in an earlier dogfight that day or in the "fight" with the Bf
109, holes were made in the forward windscreen and in some oil or
anti-freeze line.  The wind created a fine stream of oil/whatever
straight back into the windscreen and then into the cockpit -- and
directly into the pilot\'s face.  He couldn\'t close his unprotected eyes
(or keep them closed for long) and he of course couldn\'t change his
position.  As a result, he became blinder and blinder on the flight
home.  By the time he got to England, his eyes were swollen shut and the
skin around them was totally inflamed by a combination of the abrasive
and chemical effects of hours of exposure to the wind-driven oil.

The pilot didn\'t suffer any permanent injury to his eyes, and fought for
the rest of his tour -- but he always wore his goggles.

Another detail that I remember is that after one of his passes, the
German pilot flew beside the Thunderbolt, looked over at the American,
and saluted.  Then he banked away. The American thought he was gone, but
he came back and strafed him a few more times.

Regarding the Me 262, there is a famous photo of a B-17 whose fuselage
was nearly severed near the tail by an Me 262\'s cannon, but the plane
was able to return safely to England.  

Ob Traveller:  The combat rules and the design sequences necessarily
require some abstraction, so we don\'t get results like these from
rolling the dice in a combat session.  On the other hand, to preserve a
sense of fairness, the combat rules are fairly transparent, so if events
like these happen, it\'s definitely a referee call.

There\'s another angle.  Humans on Terra have developed a moral
prohibition against eating other humans.  Modern Terran societies try to
stop less developed societies from continuing the practice of
cannabilism (like in the New Guinea region).  In the Far Future, will
that prohibition have extended to a taboo against eating any other
intelligent species?

What about other humans (at least the Vilani and Zhodani)?  The Vilani
are from a planet with very few foods edible by humans without massive
processing.  Could their dark secret be that they were cannibals for the
first part of their history, until the shugili really figured out how to
process local flora and fauna?  I say dark secret, because Vilani and
Vargr doesn\'t address this at all, and, as it\'s written from the
perspective of a Vilani, if the Vilani did this and didn\'t want to hide
it, it would be mentioned.  

I don\'t remember Zhodani early history too well -- would they have been
pushed to cannibalism?

I\'ll leave discussion of the mores regarding consumption of one\'s own
species and of other intelligent species in Vargr, Aslan, and Droyne
societies to others.  I don\'t think that the Hivers eat meat at all,
just fungus.

Remember that the FW 190 and the Bf 109 (that\'s the correct Luftwaffe
designation, by the way, not Me 109 -- I don\'t remember why, and all the
other Messerschmitts were Me ###) were in production for several years,
and were constantly being refined to meet enemy armor improvements,
changing battlefield roles, and other changing conditions.  I don\'t
remember anymore just what weapon configurations each went through.  It
seems to me that the Bf 109 had at least 7 different versions, Bf 109a
through Bf 109g.  I don\'t remember how many the FW 190 had.

The largest aircraft  mounted weapon that was actually used in combat that I\'m
aware of was the standard Model 40 75mm AT gun with a special recoil system
and a very good muzzle brake mounted on Henschel 129 attack bomber. It had a
12-shot magazine. About thirty guns were produced and used on the Eastern
front from the summer of 1944. Reportedly, the first 14 missions knocked out 9
heavy tanks.

Reportedly, there was a similar weapon fitted to Russian Sturmoviks used in
anti-shipping role in the Murmansk area

The Luftwaffe also mounted the old Model 39 50mm on a "recoil-absorbing
medchanism and fitted it to a Ju88. It was originally hand-loaded by the crew
! This was developed into an auto-loading  system that carried a 22 round
magazine with a ROF of 45 rounds per minute. About  300 of these were deployed
on the Eastern front

Howevr, the prize for size in small aircraft goes to a _32pdr_ ( 94mm!)  AT
gun mounted on a Mosquito and succesfully fired, though this was not used in
combat as it happened after VE day. It used a very cleverly designed muzzle
brake to reduce the recoil.

What may have confused people about the Fw190 is that they _did_ mount a 30mm
60 _barrel_  (!)upward- firing gun mounted behind the pilots seat, on a Fw190
as an anti-bomber weaopon

There is also the Gerat 104 350mm gun mounted underslung on a Dornier 217
designed for anti-shipping use, with the weight of the 14000lb projectile
expelled from the front supposedly being balanced by firing a similar weight
object out the back, based on the USN Davis gun principle.
Again "never used in combat"

I had young Dave around tonight, and he had a look at some of the e-mails
rolling of my desktop and this one caught his eye.  I personally have never
put a lot of thought into interstellar trade, but when he saw this he told
me how he looked at it and I felt it wasn\'t bad for a boy in his middle
teens...

He looks at the Empire (Imperium) much as he looks at the real world when it
comes to trade and commerce.  Places like the US can get buy with producing
virtually anything they like and if the rest of the world placed them on an
embargo, they wouldn\'t suffer a great deal.  But look at Australia, a huge
place which is mostly empty (I once heard in the 70\'s the analogy of one US
city [N.Y.?] was almost the entire population of Australia... give or take).
We do not manufacture everything we need here in this country, much less
domestic manufacture for domestic use.  What Australia makes well, it only
makes in small quantities, simply because if we had the number or
manufacturing bases required to make everything, the country would soon go
bust because we don\'t have the domestic market for it, and we cannot afford
to compete with other nations on a wide basis.

Same goes for Japan, only their problem is organic consumables like beef and
mutton, or even wheat.  Sure they can make all the little things with bells
and whistles and lots and lots of things with wheels... but they can\'t grow
what they need to support their own population.  many European countries are
in similar boats, with not being able to produce everything their own little
country needs, thus relying on imports of what they don\'t have, and the
ability to export what they have lots off.

Now, I\'m not as up on the Traveller universe as I once was (I moved my PC\'s
about the Spinward Marches), so let\'s look at the hypothetical subsystem of
Ferd.  Ferd, if we are speaking metaphorically, has a system called US.
This system is large and has the ability to produce many things it needs and
lots of surplus, it is mainly industrial and heavily so.  US can produce
more than enough for itself than it needs, so it\'s surplus is regularly
shipped jump-3 to they system Asia, and can even afford to ship j-3 in the
other direction, free aid of equipment and supplies to the small, desperate
system of Central Africa!

The system Australis is J-5 from the US and ships little things there, but
mainly ships foodstuffs like dead animals to the system Asia just J-1 away,
and receives most of it\'s own technology requirements from the Asia system
in return.  It gets surprising little US trade other than the import of
sporting icons (not the sportsmen themselves, just the opportunity to
worship them) and other US culture (like wearing of hats backwards, singing
c... errr... rap, and so on).  Australis in return, export to the US,
comedians and holovids of pink starships crewed by hair blokes in frocks!
(Something that caught on in the Vargr Extents for a little while, but
proved not to be flamboyant enough)

Then along come the Zhodani who probably wouldn\'t even try to blockade the
US for fear of getting is clock cleaned... but lets say they do and for some
reason (short supply of MCr190,000,000,000.99 bolts to hold down the Navy\'s
grav-couches were in critically short supply and all their battleships and
carriers were grounded?) they succeed.  Peshaw!  The Zho\'s will have an
exceptionally long wait on their hands for this place to collapse!

They do the same with Australis, and I would personally believe that it too
would not fall quickly, because Australis would have the tech base to build
the factories it required... but I am sure, not at the same level of
efficiency as before because it would have to be able to import many key
components.

The do the same to the Japan system which, basically from my personal
studies of the place, would not be able to provide nourishment to it\'s
people and a great many would suffer!  Imagine a small world called New
Zealand?  One called Philippines?  How would these systems fare?

In the real world, South Africa suffered an embargo because of it\'s stand on
human rights (apartite... spelling?) and it ended up producing all it needed
that it couldn\'t get from other countries, like cars, weapons, even
aircraft.  It didn\'t produce any ground-shaking stuff, but it survived for
years until they changed their stance and the restrictions lifted!  So in
our hypothetical subsystem, the largish world of South Africa already had
this demonstrate to them and they thumbed their nose at the Zhodani
blockading fleets!

But you are thinking, "These are whole worlds trading with other whole
worlds we are talking about!"  And right you are!  In r/l we are talking
whole countries trading with other countries!  Not every country can produce
everything it needs itself -- not every world can produce everything it
needs itself either!  Some will fare better than others, some will go down
real quick if trade is cut off!  Look at the shortages in the former USSR.
Look at some of the poorer former Soviet Bloc countries since independence.
Look at many African nations.  If these places were blockaded further, how
would they stand?  Look further at Iraq... one of the richest countries in
the world, but their people are suffering shortages because of sanctions
too.

You have one country trading from several other countries... you will have
in most Traveller universes, one system trading with at least several other
systems.

As you may have guessed, I paraphrased most of what the lad said, but it was
nonetheless a good way of explaining how some will last much longer than
others... if they fall at all without trade.

Originally, the Bf was the abbreviation for the company
Bayerische Flegzeugwerke. After the Bf108, 109 and 110 the abbreviation
changed to Me for Willi Messerschmitt.

Similarly, the later developments of the Fw190 (Focke-Wulf) were given
the code Ta152, after the designer - Kurt Tank.

I knew the basics of this, but the spellings came from

Yes. "Our Friends from Frolix 8" being particularly useful for Traveller
aliens. "Dr. Bloodmoney" to confuse Twilight 2000 players, and "The Man in the

I also liked "Deus Irae" which was written with Roger Zelazny, another useful

I\'d also say that she owes a hell of a lot to Gordon Dickinson
The first Harrington novel is +almost+ a rewrite of "Tactics of Mistake" for
the Navy.

Also, I\'d have to add "Shards of Honor" by Bujold. So similar ot Weber\'s book,
but much nastier, it almost reads like Haledeman\'s "Forever War" compared to
"Starship Troopers", and I\'m almost certain the name of the book is an oblique
reference to Weber.

how an advanced civilization would die without
interstellar trade.

1. Wot?   No food?
2. Wot?   No money?
3. Wot?   No union labor?

Executive Summary

There are three things that must be traded for
an interstellar society to thrive.  Nutrients in the soil,
built up over millenia of cultivation of human-edible
plants, are simply not existent in large enough quantities
to support a sustainable population.  Thus food
groups must be traded, sometimes across great distances.
Banks must constantly be in communication to
sustain investor confidence, collection schedules,
and to maintain or adjust economic trends.  Finally,
industrial components are in wide demand on most
worlds, because they lack the infrastructure to maintain
their technology.



1. Wot?  No Food?

What sprung into my mind was food production.
It may be likely that these so-called "hospitable"
worlds aren\'t so hospitable in the long term.  There
may well be a scarcity of critical minerals or vitamins
that would spell death from malnutrition within a
year for most of the population.  I can handwave
that by saying most worlds haven\'t had human-edible
plants and animals on surface long enough to unlock
these ingredients from the land... and then I\'d add
to the handwave, saying it may take from 1000 to
1,000,000 years for these ingredients to propogate
in sufficient quantities to support a population:

I\'ll assume soil quality cannot exceed world size
unless technology intervenes.

soil quality           population supportable
A                      A
9                      9
8                      8
7                      7
6                      you get the picture...

years w/human plants   soil quality
10                     1
100                    2
1000                   3
10,000                 4
100,000                5
1,000,000              6

Terra, world size 8, has a soil quality of 6 or greater.
Technology has augmented this to where we could
support tens of billions -- add [tech level / 4] or so.


Of course, modifiers out the wazoo are required, since
some worlds have nasty but breathable atmospheres...

Now I\'ll deal with agricultural worlds.  Surely they of all
worlds can live on their own if necessary?  I guess I have
to say no.  There are three types of Ag worlds:

"Field worker worlds" which rely on humans and animals
to do all the work.  They won\'t suffer from technological
breakdown, but will be decimated if they lose contact with
worlds which supply various chemicals needed that the
ecosystem doesn\'t yet produce much of.

"Corporate Farms" which use tractors, combines, whatever
to do planting and harvesting.  These worlds will suffer
because, according to the rule of specialization, they\'re
probably geared NOT to make this equipment but to
produce produce produce.  After all, there are 750 worlds
nearby which don\'t produce a chemical that this ecosystem
produces en masse... and everybody loves arugula, don\'t
they?

"Hyroponia" which are automated with state-of-the-Imperium
TL 15 doo dads, while the few owners live in the lap of
luxury.  This industry will die a horrible death when trade
breaks down; however, if the population is small to begin
with, and the world is large enough, most of the population
will survive; however, they will be farming with hoes and
rakes after the crash, and will have no time to study for
their Master\'s degree.


2. Wot?  No money?

A serious crisis, such as a massive invasion by bug-eyed space
aliens or internal rebellion, would send consumer confidence way
down and cause them to stop spending money.  War would
consume the budget, the space lanes would get treacherous,
and banks foreclose on traders and themselves shut down.
Massive economic collapse would doom industrialized worlds
and all automated factories, since there\'s no money to be made.


3. Wot?  No union labor?

With economic collapse, people stop working and an Imperial-
sized depression hits the Galanglic-speaking cosmos.  Trade
slows down, triggering more collapses as the house of cards
falls.  When trade between agricultural worlds fail, critical
nutrients cease circulation, and people die by the trillions each
year, thus feeding the cycle.  One out of a hundred worlds
has the right soil and industry to continue on, but most worlds
never had the ability to go it alone.

The impetus for Imperial trade cannot be the same

Actually, the post itself makes sense: there are worlds
which are obviously dependent on the Imperium for
"survival trade".  However, there are a significant
number of worlds that don\'t fit this description.  One
can peruse world lists and find plenty o\' worlds that have
good air, "enough" water, a "C" or better starport,
and 50 million people.  There are worlds that are not
"industrial" and don\'t have tainted air... there are worlds
that aren\'t marked "agricultural" but all that means is
that they\'re not major _exporters_ of food.  Why would
these worlds fail?

There are _too many_ worlds like those above: not
overspecialized, and flexible enough to meet challenges.
Now, the Imperium might not be the Imperium without
trade, and would be much much smaller, so the 3I has a
vested interest in filling up as many worlds as possible.
But a significant number of worlds can survive fine without
trade.

I repeat, the impetus for Imperial trade cannot be the
same kind of survival need that countries have.  It must
be more desparate than that.  And that makes the Imperium
more delicate... which I kind of like, actually...

Does the Canon sources ever say that there is trade between worlds sectors
apart except perhaps for hard to find luxuries like Denuli flame gems?
The original trade system allowed for such HUGE profits per dTon per parsec
that you could actually do it but as no system was that unique (systems
differed only in their trade classes) there was generally no idea.

The Merchant Prince and MT trade systems were even less interesting there
as the price per dTon of trade goods were never very high. I\'m not shure
that long distance trade is necessary for Traveller but if somebody could
come up with a system that made it profitable for PCs then it would be a
good thing as it will promote longtrips out into the unknown leading to
interesting adventures.

Yep, the pilots reported that it felt like the plane stopped in midair
when fired.

Aye, the plane was nick named the Flying Jug.  It was well known for
coming home from missions missing large pieces of wings, fuselage,
cylinders out of the engine, telephone wire wrapped in the prop, etc.  My
kinda plane.

The B-25H.  Nasty.  They did not build many of this variant but even the
normal B25 was nothing to play with.  17 50 cal. machine guns!  IIRC.  And
without it\'s bomb load it flew more like a giant fighter plane than a
bomber.  Good all around solid design.

Still modeling after all these year.  A B25 is on my short list of models to
build and I just recently found out that there is an H model kit!

The mesons have velocity so the \'sphere\' will be moving.  The \'skid mark\'
made by the \'blast\' will be an arrow pointing tward the meson gun.  You do
not toss something at near c and have it stop instantly just because it
changes state.  That velocity has to go somewhere.  Also as someone else
said it is more likely to be a cylinder than a sphere.

1.  Food. IIRC Terran life is based around left handed amino acids, but
    there is no reason why an alien ecosystem can\'t use right handed
    amino acids. So right away 50% of the seemingly self sufficent worlds
    require the import of either a) an entire ecosystem (from bacteria up)
    or b) food. Add in lack of trace elements and you can probably cross
    off around 60% to 70% of such worlds.

2.  Specialisation. Despite the Imperium being nominally TL 15, the
    average is probably closer to 11-12. Now working on the exchange rates
    for various worlds given in JTAS and Striker, its a lot more economic for
    high tech worlds to import common comsumer goods from moderate
    tech worlds than to produce them themselves. Likewise it is
    uneconomic for moderate tech worlds to invest is specialist production
    facilities for high tech goods.

3.  Depression. The collapse of interstellar commerce would lead to the
    collapse of consumer confidence. As a result they would spend less,
    creating a depresive spiral.

4.  Tertiary Services. Industries such as banking and insurance are very
    likely to be heavily concentrated on high tech worlds. When contact is
    lost, so is the money/credit vital to drive an industrial economy.

Oh, but it is. Ever seen a 7500 ton whale? Or one that does 40 knots? Or

As I said, a well trimmed submarine will be (overall) slightly less
dense than water, to give it some natural buoyancy should it lose power.
You keep depth control by trimming the boat on the control surfaces. Of
course, below a certain speed you can\'t maintain depth control in this
manner.

The densiometers in MT have a penetration stat, but not resolution.
However, the footnote says that they can provide a density map out to
their penetration. I\'m guessing that you\'d notice the discontinuity
caused by a sub. Once you know roughly where it is, you can localise it
through other means.

Parts of a submarine that are likely to have a high density:
The powerplant.
Some part of the drive.
The computers & sensors.

Um...the fact that the mesons are moving doesn\'t mean that the sphere will be
moving, as the sphere and the mesons aren\'t the same thing.  However, I tend to
agree that there would be marks by which you could identify the direction from

Unfortunately, they wouldn\'t be very accurate....3 shots within a 100 kilometer
area might let you determine position within, say, a 5 kilometer sphere....
This is not all that useful.

How do they withstand Meson fire? Do TL-15 Grav Tanks have Meson

Most of the 37mm and 40mm cannons used in WWII were fairly low velocity,
giving them poor accuracy for air-to-air use. Most `large cannon\'
aircraft were used either to intercept bombers (which need a serious
amount of light mg fire to knock down); or to plink tanks.

The 20mm cannon was about the biggest effective air-to-air weapon, for
fighter on fighter work.

How do you think submarines navigate at the moment? Or aircraft before
the commercial release of GPS? Inertial navigation has been around for
years, but it was kinds large. It was easier (and more accurate, at the
time) to put GPS up than to miniaturise and ruggedise inertial systems.

Far Trader pg.10 has a more complete discussion of motivations for 
interstellar trade, but here\'s the factor that I think is most important for 
this discussion:
- ----
I>Economies of Scale<I> are everything that makes it cheaper to produce 
things in bulk than a few at a time.  Investments in specialized machinery, 
specially trained technicians, dedicated suppliers, and long experience all 
make production more efficient.  These investments are also very expensive, 
and need to be paid off by making the best possible use of them.  This means 
producing and selling as many widgets as possible.  Technology has a way of 
making economies of scale ever more important.  As human knowledge advances, 
so to do the opportunities for greater and greater specialization into more 
and more obscure subfields.  All of these extraordinarily educated 
individuals and their equally specialized equipment are only cost effective 
if they can share their talents as widely as possible.  Since only a small 
fraction of the economy may use their very specific output, it is only the 
much larger interstellar economy that can provide a market large enough to 
support them. 
 
No single world could possibly support the web of specialist people and 
companies the Imperium\'s technological infrastructure requires.  This is why 
the halt of interstellar trade at the end of the Second Imperium caused a 
rapid technological decline and ushered in the Long Night.  This is also why 
in the Third Imperium merchants carry technology embodied in people and 
goods 100 parsecs to their destinations.
- ----

The Imperium doesn\'t have just _one_ "critical component" it has many.  And 
the higher the TL the more there will be and the more of them that will have 
to be produced off world.

Astronomers have discovered the first solar system other

Although Jupiter-sized planets have been found around
other stars, this is the first time more than one
planet has been found around the same star..or so the

Also, TK professor of physics Dr. Witeck Nazarewicz and
two other researchers -- one from Dubna, Russia, and the
other from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
California will publish a report later this month on the
creation of Element 114 --  called for now ununquadrium
- -- which was produced by bombarding calcium isotopes with
plutonium isotopes. It\'s a superheavy element which has
been proven to be more stable than element 112 - just
like Dr. Nazarewicz\'s mathematical model predicted.

A link to the stories can be found at:

ObTrav:  Hi-TL sensors should easily be able to detect
Neptune-sized planets or larger in systems not
explored before. This should make exploration fairly
easy in regards to *knowing* the system a scout/military

As for Element 114...darn if I know. Unfortunately, I\'m
not up to speed on the commercial uses of superheavy

use?

     One of my goals in designing the trade system in Far Trader was to make 
long trips by PCs viable.  In fact, accepting long distance cargos when 
prices are good is one of the best ways for players with J-2+ ships to make 
money.

 Nope. Bujold\'s book was written in 86, years before Honor Harrington made

     It is interesting to note that the average Imperial world (particularly 
in the Marches) is cosiderably smaller than the average Terran country.  This 
implies that Imperial worlds will be even less able to produce all of their 
needs than most Terran countries.  Considering the much more hostile 
environments most Imperial worlds have, I think we have very good reasons for 
trade.

Then again, there are the comments of Colonel Blakeslee of the 4th
Fighter Group (a veteran of Eagle Squadron, the unit of US pilots who
flew for the RAF before the USA entered the war).

The 4th had been outfitted with the P47, but it wasn\'t well received by
the pilots who were used to lighter British types. When Col. Blakeslee
was congratulated on shooting down a Fw-190 in his P-47 after a diving
fight, someone said that he had `finally proven that the P-47 could
outdive a Fw-190.\'

`It ought to dive,\' said Blakeslee. `It certainly won\'t climb\'. He then
used his influence with the commander of the Eighth Air Force fighter
groups to be equipped with the P-51 Mustang.

Well, you could gengineer your colonists to the alien ecosystem.  That way they
COULDN\'T import foodstuffs.  As for the rest, Earth seems to have a pretty good
economy without insterstellar trade.

The rest of Bujold\'s work can be great for Traveller too: Technofeudal
nobles, Intelligence agencies, Mercenary fleets, Intrigue, Diplomacy, War,
Unscrupulous criminal planets.  The entire Miles Vorkosigan series is
wonderful.  About the only Traveller stereotypes Bujold doesn\'t have are

Aaaahhhhh!!! Wait until I get a job, so that I can buy stuff!!!

Seriously, people here will buy, but it\'s kind of a waste of bandwith. 
There\'s a web site hosted by one of our members (and part of the
Traveller Webring) that has a place specifically for selling stuff.

Interesting -- thanks.  Bayerische Flegzeugwerke means Bavarian Airplane
Works -- like BMW stands for Bayerische Motorwerke.  I wonder if there\'s
a relationship (via the Marshall plan)?

Ob Traveller:  After the Fifth Frontier War, will the Imperium funnel
lots of resources into rebuilding the Spinward Marches?  How about the
DMZ?  Will the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate compete for the right
to assist worlds in the DMZ that were battlefields during the war?

Well, I think I have.  I think that presenting thing like
using demountable tanks when drop tanks would work better,
presenting cargo prices that are clearly not dependent on
drop tanks, how military ships are presented as jumping
in without fuel, etc. are all clearly inconsitent with
drop tanks.  But if you don\'t agree, then I guess we
will have to agree to disagree.

It is true that nothing says "we had to do it this way because
drop tanks don\'t exist".  But then it doesn\'t say "we had to
do it that way because we couldn\'t sacrifice virgins to Zeus"
but that doesnt\' mean all subsector capitols are linked by
messages sent via sacrifices to Zeus.

That fact is that if it was presented to me "Oh, most things
have always gone by drop tnaks" that _would_ be a problem
for me.

I don\'t agree.  There isn\'t any reason to expect them to be
that expensive.  If you get at least a few ships a day, it
will be reasonable to have drop tank service.

>Drop tank tramp ships? My guess is that drop tank service and tramp ships
>will be incompatible. How do you figure otherwise?

Because it is cheaper?  They increase a beowulf\'s cargo 30%.
30% of your monthly mortgage payment is 33,750 Cr.  We know
from Far Trader the cost of a tanker to move cargo out to
the jump is 100Cr/dton of fuel.  Then all you need is the
tanker to hang around and fuel a ship or just a big tank to
store it in.

No, because it is arbitrary and doesn\'t make sense.  It is

Oh, cool!

FWIW: 

My YugoBox FT free trader class has the following:

(as a class, first 100)

1)	Scrapes and Dents: 

	The shipyard\'s real tight, as we\'re making a LOT of these puppies, so
some banging around is to be expected.

2)	Shaky Inertial Compensators: 

	A recall order has been placed on these units, whihc were acquired from
MissionTech Gravitics, a now bankrupt supplier of gravitic components. A
supply of replacements has being negotiated, complicated by
MissionTech\'s bankruptcy, and the parts are in transit to all our
service centers.

	This flaw affects YugoBox FT mod.1 serial no\'s 23-766543-021 through
23-766543-121 only. All subsequent ship deliveries have had Kiirka
Gravitics Ltd. inertial compensators units.

	The problem is only noticeable under higher acceleration, and is
manifested as a slight fluttering of the compensation. This gives a
ride, not unlike running a wheeled groundcar on a marginal gravel paved
road. YugoShip customers  with affected vessels are encouraged to come
into any of our authorized starport sevice centers and get these units
replaced. As a courtesy, we will also provide coupons good for 2 life
support consumables packs to the customer, free of charge. We apologize
for any inconvenience.

3)	Flaky Security system:

	There are known bugs in the MicroSystems security software suite
installed on the YugoBox line, with the standard Security option. Under
certain conditions, The system will repeatedly lock and unlock secured
doors in rapid cycling. 

The main diagnostic of this is that the Security window of the
designated admnistrative console is locked, and displays only a bright
blue box, with a cryptic error message. MicroSystems engineers have
traced this to an old programming flaw in legacy code embedded some of
their lesser used software subsystems. The only known fix at this time
is to shut down the Security module and repower it, and the associated
hardware, back from a cold start.

MicroSystems engineers expect to have a patch available soon, please
contact them, using problem code BSD-55243-NT-876 to be notfied when
such a patch is available.

Alternatively, upgrading to iSecure 3.5, an enhanced security system
from ApplTech Software Solutions is also supported, and YugoShips PLC is
offering a 50% discount to customers wishing to upgrade. This discount
does not apply to new customers.

Thank you.

I don\'t think so, as there are Beemers (both four and two wheeled)

If a sub is doing 40 knots, it\'s because it\'s already

Can someone explain how "displacement detection" works? I can see it

Why, there are 5,000-10,000-ton Whaloids on dozens of planets

A sub doing 40 knots has already been detected and shot at.

When the jug got equipped with the "paddle-blade" propellors; their

bird. Empty; it weighed more than a loaded Spitfire, and it was the largest 
single engine fighter of the war. I could see a fighter jock seeing this

Any situation where an outside force is attepting to conquer another would
probably involve the conquerors interdicting internal traffic/communication.
In such a case, the higher the target\'s tech, the more serious the effect.  

As an example, the United States can certainly produce more than enough food
to take care of its own needs.  But food production (in land, equipment, and
perhaps most importanttly, experience and knowledge) is not equally
distributed across the country or within the population.  I seem to remember
reading that only some 2% of the U.S. population are farmers.  Most
non-farmers do not know how to produce enough food to live on, even if they
had the materials and arable land available (I worked on a dairy farm for 2
years and I know that I don\'t know).  And just as important as the knowledge
and ability to produce food is the ability to transport it to the hungry
people.  A TL 1 society wouldn\'t be affected as badly.  If 97% of the
population are farmers, then food production is much more universal;
everyone could still eat.

Look at the GDW alien module description, and realise who big and

Talk about a bursting disk - although, it could make a meson shot hard.

	The only problem I have with this "jump masking" idea is this ...
WHEN does the object have to be in the way? Remember, astronomical
objects MOVE at astronomical speeds. So that gas giant in the outer
system of your destination may not be on that straight line *now* ...
but maybe it will be at some time between now and now+7 days. Or
maybe it is now, but won\'t be now+7 days. Ditto for any objects
between systems.

	It basically depends on how many people are working for you. For
example, a small cutter might be commanded by a senior enlisted. A
ship of the line is commanded by a full Captain (O6).

	For some weird reason* the Navy _only_ uses O7=Commodore during war.
During peace, O7=Rear Admiral, Lower Half

	Not quite--the two precursor beams cannot travel through most
matter. A meson gun brings the two beams together within the bore to
collide, generating meson particles. These particles don\'t interact
with other matter, and hence can pass through anything.  They also
have a very short lifespan, and when they decay, the resulting decay
products DO interact with matter ... dumping large quantities of
energy into whatever absorbs them.

	Since these mesons are travelling at relativistic speeds, by
adjusting the speed you can tweak how much time dilation they
experience, and hence when they\'ll decay.

That\'s the official explanation, anyway. Don\'t let any physicists try
to tell you otherwise ...

I can see some problems with this.  Chief among these is that you have
just prevented your colonists from ever cross-breeding with the
homeworld\'s population (barring reverse gengineering).  This seems an
excellent way to lead one\'s colonies to lack any sort of bond with the
homeworld.  Of course, from a dramatic point of view, you can make the
difficulties of Romeo and Juliet seem tame.  All they had to deal with
was a feud between their respective families.  A gengineered colonist
who fell in love with a homeworlder _couldn\'t_ bear/father children with
his/her beloved; thier biochemistries would be incompatible.  Add to
this the pressure from a colonial government to have large families, and
you begin to see how joyous life would be for these (dare I say it?)
star-crossed lovers.

Problems, yes as you described.  But for the ones who tend towards the
"Other" career, they would make great items to sell into white slavery.  No
chance of having to worry about pregnancies, and a very small chance of
transmitted STDs.

        Hi, Dave...
        This kind of gets back to the discussion that Cliff and I were
having about the odd "Star Wars" comment about the Millienium Falcon doing
the Kessel Run in "less than three parsecs"...  the challenge for the
computer/ navigator to beat down a course that avoids all the obsticals
between departure and destination with as few and as tight distance-adding
course changes in the process.
        All of a sudden that Navigator skill comes in useful, neh?  A bad
navigation roll and you are parked out at the destination systems OORT
cloud....  a really bad roll and you are parked out at the *departure*
system\'s gas giant....

Ah, the man in the fuligin cloak.  Great stuff for Long Night adventures.

Ob. Trav:  What happens when TL12-15 decides to make
TL 1-2 weapons?

The Torturer in the series, which you must read if you haven\'t,
has an excecutioner\'s sword.  A long blade, blunt and rounded at
the end, but with sharp sides.  The unique feature it has is an amount
of mercury _inside_ the blade.  The mercury resides in a tube that
runs the length of the blade.  While this added weight makes the sword
more difficult to carry and wield, when swung it becomes devastating.
Why?  The mercury in the blade, slides to the end of the sword as its
swinging adding to the mass and, one F=ma later (and maybe some
other formulas for inertia and momentum in there), Whammo!

In the story, its a high TL sword.  It leads me to think that some weapons
would be real nice at TL 15

An armor-piercing crossbow.
Longbows with veeery long ranges.
A two-handed sword that will dent battledress.

Wasn\'t there some discussion months ago about Axe-wielders in Battledress
as a boarding party?

Well the gengineering is a really immoral act and the premise for doing it is to stop
interstellar trade.  Thus, if you create a race that can\'t interact with other races,
you\'ve gone a long way towards that goal.

Though I think that particular example from FFW may be straining common 
sense, a (small) meson screen vehicle should be doable, though one capable 
enough to withstand a BB sized meson gun is going to be... BB sized.  ;-)  As 
WBH notes, major cities (and you can most definately assume 3CD sites, too) 
will probably have their own meson screens (multiple backups even).  It\'s for 
the defense, anyways.

Got it.  Anyone else think Heavy Time/Hellburner would make an interesting
Traveller plotline?  The riders could be real scary for conventional
Traveller warships. :-)

Heck, Cherryh in general is heavily mineable for Traveller ideas.

George MacDonald Fraser, screenwriter of "Three Musketeers" and "Four

better NPC than Sir Harry Flashman, after all in those books, he got
Custer killed, started the Indian Mutiny, and was one of the primary
reasons the South lost the American Civil War. My Harry Flashman (no one
else had read the books, so I used him unvarnished) was a Imperial Navy
hack who\'s father bought him a commission in the Navy, and its been
downhill from there on. In his travels Sir Harry has caused the Fifth
Frontier War, participated (pressed the button) in the Darrian\'s test of
the new Startrigger, and through sheer out and out cowardice failed to
stop Strephon\'s assassination (who\'d ya think accidentally sealed the
throneroom from Strephon\'s IRIS hidden bodyguard?) Imagine a combination

Harry down pat. Only mine was much worse!

Except you haven\'t.  "Think" is hardly enough.   Hans is probably out for a

A noticible, but hardly catastrophic, economic effect, even using the rules 
set of your choice (GT & Far Trader).  Couple with numerous factors having 
nothing to do with economics... (including PR, sabotage, mass 
misrepresentation by opposing interests, etc)

Based on ludicrous assumptions to begin with.  Maybe for foolish third rate

experience behind it.

Bummer.  Unfortunately it is *your* problem and doesnt\' seem widely shared.  
If things were explained thoroughly enough that it could be a valid 
assumption (remember what they say bout assuming), you might get some 
sympathy.  Any inferences and detailing and assumptions made for YTU remain 
solely for YTU.

Because it is.  That\'s the way drop tanks "work."  If you were open minded

Simply declaring them (and all references to them, in every edition) null and

How do you figure this is immoral?  If the only way to keep a colony viable at 
a certain place is to geneer colonists to survive there, then you *do* it.  
And I can see doing this for truly vital planets, like, say, in a system 
that\'s a vital link across an interstellar gulf.  If the modifications aren\'t 
too drastic, say, on the order of adding a nictitating membrane to the eyes 
and a filter in the windpiple to screen out sand for survival on a bright 
desert planet, this doesn\'t mean that the colonists can\'t crossbreed with 
\'mainstream\' humans.

The immoral part was gengineering them specifically so that the CAN\'T interact with others.
Its a different story if you do it for their own survival.

Well, again  the example involved changing the population so they can metabolize the
other-handed amino acids.  The examples you\'ve given can be solved without gengineering.

I\'ve done this a few times for practice and paid off a Type A in under 2 years.

If you have the Type A paid off and get the book value for it, you get MCr 37, 
which you can use for the deposit on the new ship.  What I\'ve done in the past 
is, kept on trading after the Type A is paid off, with the profits rolled over 
to build up to the deposit needed for the new ship.  Then, when the new ship 
is about due to be delivered, sell the Type A for whatever you can get to 
finance the first trade pioneering cruise.  <grin>  Timing is everything.

Best thing you can do with a Type A is, knock out the passenger staterooms and 
convert it into either cargo space or more fuel space.  Dump the steward and 
the medic and replace with a pair of gunners who can do other things, too, 
like navigate, patch people up, or whatever else needs doing.  You get back 24 
dtons from the staterooms, and 10 dtons for taking out the low berths.  That\'s 
20 tons more fuel and 14 tons more cargo space.  You can now do 2xJ1 and haul 
96 tons of cargo.  Makes a nice \'trade pioneer\' variant.  IMTU, some of the 
ships around have done this, at a C or better port, for 1/2 the cost of the 
staterooms and low berths.

Sure, they can.  With *technology*.  What happens if your technology fails

Well, on your desert planet, I\'ll point out that we have entire cultures living out in deserts
with very low tech protection.

> Say, on a total waterworld?

Water worlds are different.  I have to wonder what the climate would be like.  Without land
masses, I\'d picture a world  perpetually raining and overcast.  A particularly warm planet would
have continuous hurricanes as there would be no land to cut off the storm\'s  warm water supply.
At that point, I\'d have to wonder why anybody would populate it in the first place, or how
they\'re living, since the surface is too  rough to live on.

However, I think we\'re diverging from the point about needing interstellar trade.  If a planet
cannot support its population for whatever  reason, then it will never be anything more than an
outpost or colony.  At that point you may as well argue that a space ship can\'t get along without
interstellar trade.

Or the real fix \'cause all of ASS\'s have hidden flaws that require new

Ok.  Fine for Battledress.  But I meant more realistic things.
A rapier that will scratch a starship hull and will never dull.
A high-power electric stun spear.
Ceramic plate mail?
Super alloy light weight chain mail?

What would be the toughness and density of DU in FFS2 terms?
I think there is a lot of room for additional types of materials at
high TLs.  As it is, we pretty much have only the materials for
building ships and vehicles with.  I\'m thinking more along the lines
of ceramic composite body armor, and advancements like that.
I don\'t know enough about materials to suggest something workable.

Gary, did you check out my jump-6 Decafreighter that uses drop tanks ?

Just to remind you, if you assumed that you had drop tanks that cost KCr 1
per dton, it came in at Cr 1850 per dton to achieve a 5% rate of return
doing jump-6 (every KCr extra the drop tank cost increased this number by
Cr 780 or so). 
 
As a design, it was brutally non-optimised (TL9 power plant, for a start).

And it shipped a dron of cargo six parsecs in one hit for under two
thousand credits.

This means the passenger version could be offering FFS2 bunks for about a
thousand credits per jump-6.

The effect would be on the scale of railroads - you still had the same
basic structure by the end of it (a capitalist economy mainly dominated by
port cities), but everything else was different. Most definitly including
culture, society, military strategy and so on and so forth.

There was the time I took a cargo of fresh farm produce to Fulacin.
The referee said that, whilst Fulacin would pay well for some of the cargo,
the population of about 10 didn\'t want all 80std...

Michel said his players *immediately* sold the ship, so the most they could
get back was the deposit.
Even after only 2 years, you still won\'t get book value (ie MCr37) for it.

IIRC it has been theorized that right handed amino acids would not be as
stable & resistant to radiation as left handed acids are.  If this is
correct then planets with right handed acids would be uncommon to
nonexistant as right handed amino acids would not be evolutionarily
stabel, save perhaps on planets with thick atmospheres.

I do not necessarily believe this theory but, at the very least, it
provides a convenient handwave for the paucity of such problems in
Traveller cannon.

The reason those TL 15 elite grav armored units are tough is that
they\'re facing Sword World troops at TL 10-12, and the combat results
table shifts three, four, or five columns in favor of the higher tech
level.  That is, they don\'t have to face meson fire.  They\'re less tough
against TL 14 Zhodani Consular Guard brigades.

The Sword Worlds front can be defended by a few high-tech mercenary
battalions, because of the CRT column-shifting.

This is a recurring discussion on the TML (and I\'m not saying that like
it\'s a bad thing).  

In my Traveller universe, when PCs get "blade" as a mustering out
benefit from the Imperial Navy or Marines, they normally get a
functional (as opposed to purely decorative) sword or cutlass,
respectively, but it\'s of TL 14 or 15 manufacture and designed for blade
combat at that tech level.  

So while it may be so dense that, turned off, it can\'t be picked up by
someone not wearing battle dress, it also has an integral gravitic unit
that gives it a weight that can be managed by a person of normal
strength.  (The battery powering the grav unit may not last very long,
so there\'s some danger of a hernia.)  

Its edge may be so sharp that it can cut through some armor.  Its blade
may be so strong that it can support the weight of its owner.  

We already see big differences between blade weapons manufactured today
versus in medieval times.  Modern blades are made of harder alloys that
don\'t corrode and don\'t get dinged up as easily in use.  Modern blades
are also not designed for fighting against medieval armor because modern
blade combat is not between armored opponents -- but that\'s changing, as
soldiers tend to wear flak jackets and helmets and will probably wear
even more protective gear as it becomes lighter and less expensive.  If
one of the makers of combat knives did decide to make broadswords to
modern standards, the modern broadsword would likely get through armor
made at medieval standards.

These are two of my all-time favorite characters.  Flandry is a sort of
lecherous and scheming Horatio Hornblower type (and Poul Anderson did
write about his whole career from ensign to admiral), assigned to naval
intelligence.  These stories are very good for Traveller background;
Loren Wiseman and Marc Miller must have been Poul Anderson fans (e.g.,
maybe the taint in the atmosphere is an allergen that will kill a human
if he doesn\'t get the antidote every day ... manufacture of which is
wholly within the control of the theocratic dictatorship).

Economies of scale are not enough for the rampant
specialization which may be implied from _Far Trader_.

Economies of scale are balanced by another rule: the rule of
decreasing returns.  There is a point beyond which further
specialization does not yield significant returns.

In addition, economies of scale are non-existant unless
the technology is proven, the cost of research is paid off,
and research begins on the NEXT tech level; that\'s when
the corporations start mass production, to sell cheap
enough to meet demand.  In general, of course.



Long-winded:

When we talk about a world with 5000 people on it, I can
guarantee that that world is specialized beyond its ability
to survive without trade.  But when you\'re talking about
a world with tens of millions of people, you\'ve got to have
infrastructure to meet everyone\'s needs, and that includes
local maintenance at the appropriate tech level.

...and when you\'re talking billions of people, then you\'ve
gone beyond a reasonable scaling of a task.  Ever try to
run a company with one billion people?  Corporations
fit their unit sizes to the task at hand, to the demand, and
that is going to be local because someone else a subsector
or three away can do the same job for its local market.

The rule of decreasing returns has other names: too many
cooks spoil the broth.  The more people you have, the harder
it is to direct them all well.

I suggest that there is a significant economic benefit to building
10 trillion widgets of type A plus 10 trillion tons of arugula
than just building 20 trillion widgets of type A.

The question is where to draw that line... Far Trader doesn\'t
convince me yet.  I\'ve got to think about it more.

That paragraph out of Far Trader sounds like it applies to
cutting-edge research into new technology; however, once
the cost of research is paid off, THEN the technology
becomes ubiquitous and reasonably priced.  Example:
items at a given tech level are greatly discounted at worlds
with a higher tech level.  That\'s because production is easy
and the research is done, the design proven.  Production
HAS to be easy, or else there\'s little demand, no market,
and no trade because the price is too high for "the market".

On the other hand, Far Trader implies that there is a
theoretical maximum to Terra\'s tech level.  Have you ever
thought that we might be near our TL maximum?  The
thought, frankly, has never occurred to me.  "Cover the
world and subdue it" says Genesis chapter 1.  I think
there\'s something about our will and ability that suggests
we have a long way to go before we\'re done.  And that\'s
TL8!  Unless, of course, we thoughtlessly eat all the
plants before we\'re done... remember Rapuni!

Actually, I had only figured on the shot giving a crude vector to the meson
gun.  As for MY favorite ship, it would have a damned good meson screen if
it were close enough to be a target.  I\'d tranship anything that need to get
to the planet onto meson screened ships or very small lighters to go to the
planet and keep the ships without screens well back.

This brings up another posible point.  Using radiation sensors it might be
posible to back calculate the distance the mesons traveled before they went
boom.  If so then only one or two shots would be necessary to lock down the
meson gun\'s location even assuming quite a bit of slop in each reading.
Once you get the area down to double digit kilometers you can zero in with
other sensors.  Those big guns have to have power and their firing is bound
to produce waste energy and EM noise.

That\'s a little pricey don\'t you think?  The bulkheads are already there.
All you need is to give your engineer a good supply of cutting torch gas and
put him to work.  After the gutting you\'d need a few odds and ends to finish
up the job.  A good scrounge should be able to get those for free or a the
price of a round or two of drinks but IF you do not have such a person a few
K credit should get you the plate metal and piping to do the job.  And why
not sell those state rooms and there contents for a profit?  I\'m sure  there
would be some demand for them on the spare parts market...

I did that a while back.  I don\'t remember what my result was, but I think it
was like 40 kL per person.  That included Algae tanks for air/waste recycle
and a vegetarian diet.  You\'d probably still want to check in periodically for
annual maintenance.

With a power crank and an appropriate magazine mechanism, plus those
itty-bitty SEFOP HE arrowheads, you would have an interesting toy.

Harder to do, as long as these are strictly muscle power...the world record
for a hand bow shot was set a long time ago, though the rules might exclude
compound bows from that. The real high teck trick is to get really, really
stiff arrows...a significant portion of a bows energy goes into flexing the
arrow. With a longbow, high speed photography reveals that the arrows get a
significant U-bend in them when fired. The wobble induced by the arrow
snapping back also affects distance and accuracy.

Then, there\'s those HE arroheads, again...;-)

> A two-handed sword that will dent battledress.

Just has to be sharp enough. Really advanced ceramics and composites ought to
hold close enough to a monoatomic edge. Make the rest of the blade thin and
slippery enough and you can cut through just about anything. The real trick is
making the sheath for such a sword. 

Perhaps an advanced, gravitics formed, high energy plasma wand...which will
cut through anything, except of course, another advanced, gravitics formed,
high energy plasma wand...;-) Just so long as they make the appropriate
ZZZzzzhhhhhhoooopWuuuuunnnnngggggg noise when you turn them on.

Or...sinclair monofilament, anyone? "...watch the glowing little red ball..."

Speaking of which...what about that stuff...is there any canon reference to
such a material? I can\'t believe they didn\'t steal _that_ from Niven along
with everything else.

Unless, of course, they got multiple Free Trader results from character gen,
in which case they might have 10 or more years of payments already made.

     I\'m sorry, but I think this is a little silly.  At their hey-day, neither Rome nor Athens 
could produce enough food for their citizens and had to import it from elsewhere.  Obviously 
neither was merely an outpost or colony.

places for mining and industry but bad places to grow food.  Even if they conceivably could grow

to import it from a terrestrial world.  In the event that trade were suddenly cut-off, the 
asteroid world would not have the facilities in place to grow food and might starve.  Even if 
they could build the necessary ag facilities, they would be much more costly than importing food 
and consequently would cause a large decline in the standard of living.
	Let me put it even more simply: there are large gains from trade, when those gains 
disappear the affected society will either become much poorer or, in extremis, disappear.  This 
is what the Long Night and Hard Times are all about.

IIRC, FFS2 has some stats on doing \'vegetable patch\' life support.

This puts me in mind of one of Phil Kitching\'s designs which I loved ...

So assuming Phil\'s figures are correct, can you beat 7,377Cr per person
per year by importing the food ?

By the way, Far Trader, is the best GT product out to date IMHO.

The owner of my FLGS says he has sold more Far Traders than any other GURPS
suplement, ever.

Able to produce food irrespective of the local ecology and with sufficient

to be able to exist even in asteroid fields, the Garden class only needs
enough
local shipping to be able to take the food where it is needed.

To this end it can dock up to three 1kdt transports simultaneously.

All of the airlocks have advanced decontamination facilities to reduce

The thiry five trained mission specialists are backed up by an impressive

But when you have such a large K\'Kree ship in your belt, how do you keep

Again, in GURPS (not GT) a battlesuit with Strength 80 or so (whish is
quite reasonable for a heavy battlesuit; Traveller battledress tend to be
_much_ lighter) wielding a monowire sword can do more damage than anything
short of a PGMP....  And you don\'t want to use that inside a ship, anyway....

It\'s not actually much damage, but against heavily armored targets, the
armor divisor is very effective.  Pay attention as the battlesuited trooper
cuts his way into a Grav tank...

Firstly, I think you\'re confusing economies of scale with mass production.  
Economies of scale begin to kick in whenever you build more than one of 
something and don\'t require you to be pumping out gazillions of identical 
units.  In their narrowest definition, economies of scale occur when there 
are fixed costs to production.  For instance, the producer has to make large 
investments in specialized people and machinery no matter how many widgets 
he produces.  There are also costs that occur per unit produced, these are 
called marginal costs.  The unit cost of something is the marginal cost plus 
a portion of the fixed costs.

UC = MC + FC/x

UC=Unit Cost per widget
MC=Marginal Cost
FC=Fixed Cost
x=#of units produced

Now, if for some widget FC=100MCr and MC= 1MCr then:

x=1, UC=101
x=2, UC=51
x=10, UC=11
x=100, UC=2
x=1000, UC=1.1
x=10,000, UC=1.01

Notice how rapidly the unit cost declines even early on?  Just producing two 
widgets instead of one cuts costs in half.  In fact, the largest gains come 
with the earliest increases in scale.

The second point I\'d like to make is that since the largest gains come with 
the earliest increases in scale, economies of scale apply most powerfully to 
relatively small batches of specialized goods.  This is probably counter to 
your intuition, but as the above example illustrates, it is true.  This 
means that economies of scale are not important where you\'re producing 10 
trillion widgets versus 20 trillion widgets.  They\'re most important where 
Dr. Zafius and his lab team are producing 100 units of gizmos to serve the 
entire annual market of the Spinward Marches.  Without a market as large as 
an entire sector, the price of gizmos would shoot up to the point where they 
probably wouldn\'t be made at all.

Now I have to convince you of the existance of something so specialized as 
gizmos.  This may be more difficult.  Think about a TL-0 society.  All the 
skills available at that TL can be mastered by a small tribe or extended 
family.  Now think about our modern TL-7/8 society.  To master the profusion 
of specialized skills and subfields available, it takes virtually the entire 
developed world -- over a billion people!  We can argue about whether it 
truly takes a billion people or some subset, but the point is that it takes 
many orders of magnitude more than in a TL0 society.  This is not just true 
of technology.  Think about GDW and Traveller.  Only a very small percentage 
of the populace is interested in Traveller.  GDW survived for as long as 
they did because they sold all over North America, Europe, Australia, NZ, 
etc.  If their market had been confined to Illinois do you think they could 
have made a living?  Of course not.  My argument is that as technology 
advances the required number of specialized goods and services increases 
very rapidly, perhaps exponentially. Thus, just as a TL-7 society requires 
many orders of magnitude more skills than a TL-0 society, so too will a TL-
15 society require many orders of magnitude more skills than a TL-7 society.

Third, economies of scale are only one of three reasons I give for 
interstellar trade in Far Trader.  The other two are variety and comparative 
advantage.  If you like I can send you the whole section, but I don\'t want 
to clutter up the list with it.

Fourth, I do believe that there is a theoretical maximum on Earth\'s TL, but 
I don\'t think we\'re anywhere near it.  If nothing else, there are 6 billion 
people on Earth and only about 1 billion of them are really participating in 
our advanced industrial society.  When all 6 billion people on Earth have 
college degrees and email accounts then we\'ll _begin_ to test the limits of 
our technological creativity.  As you say, unless we thoughtlessly eat all 
the plants first.

I am a Trav newbie(GURPS convert) and about to run my first trav

What does one experience when entering and leaving jump?  I\'ve read
that you can jump from standing still, or while in motion.  Is there a
difference in the feel of the 2 types?

Also, I\'ve not found reference to whether of not an extended period of

this just a fuel issue?

	In general, farming has got to be cheaper on a planet than an asteroid 
because the planet gives you soil, air, water, gravity, etc. for free 
whereas on an asteroid you have to build everything yourself.  You can 
imagine technologies where that wasn\'t the case, but then I don\'t think 
you\'re talking about something consistent with Trav background anymore. 
	The Garden-class design you attached does produce a lot of food, but 
it is generally low quality and very expensive.  Most of the food comes from 
algae vats with some vegetables and small amounts meat, most of it guinea 
pigs and such.  Canonical figures on per-capita income in Traveller have 
always been somewhat debatable, but everyone places them somewhere around 
10,000-15,000Cr/yr for the average Imperial citizen.  Devoting half to two-
thirds of one\'s income to food is not cheap by anyone\'s definition.

	Thanks very much for the complement and the good news!  I hope it\'s as 
popular elsewhere.

According to GT, Monowire (and vibra-weapons for that matter) exist, but

OK, you have to take out more than just bulkheads and partitions.  You have to 
remove or block air vents.  You have to reroute fiber optic and/or hard lines 
and power cables.  You have to pull up the grav plates on the floor.  You have 
to retune the life support system a bit to keep it from taking out *too* much 
CO2 (remember, it\'s CO2 that triggers your body to *breathe*).  If you\'re 
installing fuel tankage, you\'ll have to run lines too and from the new tank 
and put in pumps that can survive the temperatures that LHyd is at.  You have 
to *INSULATE* the tanks (An old rule from somewhere that slips my mind at the 
moment says that if you enter an LHyd tank that\'s *NOT* empty, you *DIE* 
because you freeze to death within a round) so that the LHyd doesn\'t boil up 
to hydrogen gas.  IMTU, conversions like this also need *paperwork* to show 
that the conversion was *SAFE* or their spaceworthyness certificate gets 
pulled and the boat is grounded until it *DOES* comply.  All this takes a bit 
of money.  I used the figure of 1/2 the new cost to cover the entire 
conversion.  That *INCLUDES* the sale of the stripped out parts.

However, each 10 year block you take off the payments means the ship is 10 years older.  If you get 5 Free Trader results, you have a boat free and clear, but it\'s 40 years old.  And just *perfect* to roll on that guy\'s 77 Quirks table to give it some \'personality\'...

Rumour has it that you can detect, with suitable gear, the `lump\' in the

Dozens of planets. Fine. On *those* planets, subs will work against this
kind of detection (unless the invader doesn\'t care about making them an
endangered species - which is exactly what the RN did in 1982, according
to rumour).

On all those without Behemoths?

Today, yes - for noise reasons. At TL15?

The problem was that the experienced pilots in the ETO had `grown up\'
with the Spitfire (whilst flying in Eagle Squadron and with the early
USAAF units outfitted with the Spit) - and they weren\'t used to the
`big, heavy\' school of thought.

I don\'t think it\'s ever been throughly examined in canon. On many ships
it is traditional to dim the lights just before jumping, this is mostly
observed on culturally Vilani ships, and dates back to the dawn of star
travel, when jump drives needed every erg of energy the ship could
muster to jump, and so, life support was shut down momentarily.

As for physical feelings, that\'s mostly up to the eref. Most I know have
the players experience a moment of disorientation or dizziness as the
ship enters jump space. Various individuals are more or less susceptible
to this. In bad cases the person can become ill with jump sickness, a la
seasickness. Very bad cases must remain drugged up or not jump at all.

Some people don\'t notice a thing.

I\'ve read that you can jump from standing still, or while

	IMTU (In My Traveller Universe), there is only a
	very subtle feeling of disorientation (caused by
	latent Psi effects) that distinguishes jump from 
	acceleration in normal space. This effect does not
	depend on the motion of the vessel.

Also, I\'ve not found reference to whether of not an 
extended period of time is needed between coming out of 
jump, and jumping again...or is this just a fuel issue?

	Again, IMTU: even the most carefully plotted and
	executed jump is unlikely to put you exactly 
	where you aimed, so after emerging into normal 
	space the new position must be calculated and the
	next jump plotted. Even if a suicidal crew opted
	to jump immediately, without positioning and 
	plotting, I would require 10 minutes in normal 
	space to charge up and engage the jump drive. Of
	course, this assumes that the vessel carries 
	enough fuel for two successive jumps.

Uh? You are probably thinking of S-shaped cost functions. Nice 
example if you are thinking of agriculture, quite dubious that it 
means anything at all in a general sense, like an aggregate economy, 
or even for high-tech food production.

What you are calling "rule of decreasing returns" is just an 
*arbitrary example* of how things *might* be for a technology. 
Totally useless as a general argument.

Assuming by *easy* you mean *cheap,* that\'s a way to put things. 
Demand, however, comes from the population, and we are *far* from 
understanding it. Saying "little demand, no market" is therefore 
dangerous. Plenty of examples of demand for expensive, inefficiently 
produced goods even in the presence of cheaper substitutes.

Uh? Wrong definition. That\'s just an example which implies economies 
of scale, or, to be mroe rigorous, increasing returns to scale. The 
cost function c(x)=log (x+1) is an example of increasing returns to 
scale without any fixed costs.

Sorry, you failed my Economics 101 course! ;-)
As I say to my students 100 times per semester, Marginal Cost does 
not need to be constant. See the above example. That\'s the most 
common mistake of economists: to believe that the world is linear. 
It\'s not (in general).

All these simple examples that are taught at the basic courses in the 
faculties do not resist even the slightest reality check. Sad but 
true.

To help understand this point, if you\'ve read the Hitchhiker\'s books,
just think about the Arc B people (if I have the name right).  The hairdressers
and public phone cleaners who one society believed to be expendable.
They survived where the rest of their society died from a virus spread by

Yep! When CORE/BITS was preparing the M0 version of the Dag Sourcebook
(based on the SGK material) for IG, I had one of the subsectors. Set in
Year 20, I had a few last remnants of the Interstellar Confederacy Navy
lurking piratically in a cluster, with big TL12 (TL11 HePLAR drives)
carriers a la CJ Cherryh.

Doug Berry did a really nice design for us, which would have taken out the
90kdt Coronation class, but IG disappeared, then Excel ate the design. I
don\'t know if Doug ever recovered it.

>Heck, Cherryh in general is heavily mineable for Traveller ideas.

Absolutely - my orbital stations are heavily influenced by her books.

	The example I used is how we tend to teach it to non-major 
undergraduates.  It seemed like the appropriate level for this audience as 
well.  Your definition is certainly more general, but the fixed cost example 
I find people grasp intuitively more quickly and it is not incorrect.

	I\'m sorry to hear about my grade.  Constant marginal costs are a 
staple of undergraduate economics and I saw no reason to introduce 
additional complications here.  I was just trying to make a point with this 
example, not grant a degree.  
	Since you earlier disparaged decreasing returns to scale, I suppose 
you would argue that MC should fall with scale.  I don\'t see that this is 
any more realistic or generally true than constant or increasing MC.

	I\'m perfectly aware that reality is more complex than this, but 
stylized examples are very useful for making an argument more clear which 
was all I was trying to do.
	I\'m CC\'ing this directly to you so that if you wish to continue this 
discussion further we can easily do it off-list.

I am neither currently, although I *used* to be one of the above. ;->
One of my graduate degrees was in Business, so I got plenty of
economics among other things, but the *thrust* of my courses was aimed
at practice rather than theory.

True, but in a limited subset of cases, of course.

Carlos, that\'s a bit harsh! At least, give him a chance at a retest.

Frankly, 

UC = f(MC) + FC/x

is so much better than the flat unit costs I\'ve seen implied in all
previous versions of Traveller that I\'m thrilled.

That\'s true.  However, Jim *is* correct that a flat marginal cost is
used in many examples taught to introductory (and non-major)
students.

Guys, all three cases are true, depending on what you are modeling and
at what level of production you are modeling it, but I\'m sure you both
know that. ;->

Almost by definition, marginal costs are "the costs at the margin of
production"..the additional cost to produce one more unit. Marginal
costs can be driven up by a tightening raw material supply or labor
pool, changes in transportation costs, and production capacity
problems. They can be driven down by new (or improved) production
capacity and technology, by new sources of supply and labor, as well
as by simple experience.  Or have I flunked Carlos\' course too? ;->

Ain\'t *that* the truth! ;->

Remember UC = f(MC) + FC/x, though it might come in handy.

Hope this isn\'t too techie for you ... non-techie summary at  end
of post.

According to the MegaTraveller ruleset ... specifically  Starship
Operator\'s Manual p14 states:

    "Many feel a distinct \'wrenching\' sensation  during  jump
    transition, but few suffer any lasting  effect.  In  rare
    cases, an individual may feel nauseated for a brief  time
    following jump transition.

    In cases of misjump, however, the instances of nausea and
    similar discomforts often increase.  An unusual number of
    such complaints is taken very seriously, as it  often  is
    the first indication that a misjump has occurred."

It also states that the laws of conservation of mass  and  energy
apply to craft entering and leaving jumpspace  (ie.  it  has  the
same speed and direction leaving jumpspace  as  it  did  when  it
entered).

    "In cases where the origin and destination stars  have  a
    great proper motion  with  respect  to  each  other,  the
    navigation computer automatically compensates for  it  in
    the jump vector computations.  If factors  such  as  this
    were not considered, the ship may  find  itself  hurtling
    through space in an undesirable speed  and  direction  in
    the new  system,  and  be  unable  to  counter  with  its
    remaining fuel supply."  (SOM p13)

If you think about it, what this says is  that  if  you  are  "at
rest" relative to your  origin  then  you  are  moving  (to  some
degree) relative to your destination.  Thus "standing  still"  or
"in motion" depends on your perspective ... so I guess  it  would
feel the same between these "2 types" (because these 2 types  are
really 1 type).

Dimming the lights before the navigator  starts  the  final  jump
sequence is a Vilani tradition that stems from a time when  every
watt of power was needed to make a safe jump.  It  is  no  longer
necessary.  Some ship captains continue the tradition ... because
it is a tradition, because of supersition, or to create an effect
for passengers on a liner.  But just as many don\'t.  (Talking  of
supersitions: Droyne place a set of gold coyn\'s  under  the  jump
drive floor bolts, and Vargr beat up the first  crew  member  who
comes aboard.)

What one sees from within a craft in jump is problematic:

- - According  to  SOM  you  can  only  see  "the  undulating  gray
  \'nothingness\' of the protective jump field".

- - Loren Wiseman (IIRC) suggested recently that it looks like  the
  "snow" of an untuned TV (not the blue screen that  some  modern
  TVs display ... but like in the film Poltergeist).

- - Someone on the TML pointed out that after a week in jump, if it
  wasn\'t black then there was a problem with heat build-up.



Summary:

1) Most people feel a  wrenching  sensation  when  jumping.  Some
   also feel a moment of nausea.  If many people feel nausea then
   it is probably a misjump.

2) No difference to sensation based on ship motion.

3) Captain _may_ dim the lights prior to jump (due  to  tradition
   or supersition).

4) Jumpspace looks ...
   a) Gray
   b) TV snow
   c) Black
   d) None of the above

5) Don\'t know what the minimum turn around time is between  jumps
   but suspect it is a fuel issue ... you can have "dismountable"
   fuel tanks installed in a craft\'s  cargo  bay  which  (if  big
   enough) allow the craft to make a second jump.



Of course, what you do in your  GURPS  campaign  is  up  to  you.
Remember its YTU (Your Traveller Universe)!  Hope this helps.

I\'m asking for more detail on this. It seems to me that a stopped 
sub won\'t make any more of a lump than the equivalent mass/volume 
of water. Also, how shallow does the sub have to be running, to be 
detected this way? 

> Sub\'s don\'t do stopped very well, as I mentioned in a previous

5 knot creep, then. Or, to turn your own point against 
you, an interstellar-tech sub shouldn\'t have any problem at 
all using thrusters to hold still. That same sub can also run
insanely deep. At interstellar tech, by the way, a sub is 
equivalent to an SDB with < 1G maneuver drive, with fuel tanks 
expanded in volume until the average density of the ship matches 
the density of the water it\'s sitting in. 

(Didn\'t someone just go through this tech escalation thing
when trying to discuss atmospheric versus aerospace versus
space fighters? :)

Tomorrow, yes, to avoid the rumored "displacement detection".
Once you have a silent propulsion system, how fast can you 
run an elongated teardrop shape that big through water 
without creating an audible rush? That would be the upper 
limit on stealthy sub maneuvering.

Well, the only times I can think of the happening is when there
is a cash flow problem for that company or they are just ignorant
of what they can use.  This doesn\'t scale to society as a whole
because there will always be someone not in this position.

Well, have a _segement_ doesn\'t change the problem.  (thought there
is the other problem that they are cheap enough that if you
competetors are using them, you will have to, or go out of business).

Temporarily.  However, if they are as cheap as they appear to be,
then one will simply build more capacity with a little extra for
busy periods (so there won\'t be any more bottlenecks than their will
be for buying fuel at the station).

My problem is that I don\'t think this works.  You have to
hem them in with too many arbitrary restrictions that aren\'t
intuite (or even don\'t make sense).

In YTU, it can stand for whatever you want.  I was just letting you know
the official designation.  Mora in the Spinward Marches is designated "C" -
Charasmatic Oligarchy and is a matriarchy in all the descriptions I have seen.

The official government profiles that I could find are 0-9, and A-F are the
standard ones listed in the main books.  G-N (excluding I) are Aslan
government types, P-R are K\'Kree governments, S-U and W are Hiver (who also
use 0,1,2 & 6).  Droyne use types 6, 7 & X.  The Imperium, Zhodani,
Solomani and Vargr all use the 0-F standard governments.

This leaves open V, Y & Z governments that I could not find governments
assigned to (aside from I & O which are always dropped).

It can\'t be done; the shipbuilding logic is too different.

There have been a wide variety of writeups of the AHL, however.

dton), and have a relativly low demand (basically three per starship built
each year, plus one per twenty starships in space per annum). If you get a
20% fall in production costs by building them in one place, you can ship
them a long way before transport costs exceed the volume discount. There
are many FFS2 goods with these characteristics.

You may see most economies being open only at the top end - food and other
\'basic\' goods are produced locally, while the world participates in trade
for machine tools, computers, luxuries, starships and so on. This is
analagous to the manorial economies of the 9th to 14th centuries - they
produced most of the stuff locally, but wine, fine cloth, weapons and
spices were imported, paid for with cash from exporting the small
agricultural and industrial surplus to the closest town or annual fair.

Macro stuff :

The Third Imperium is clearly a free-trade capitalist universe, but many of
it\'s worlds are definitly suffering from chronic crises of
underdevelopment. There are just too many hi-pop, lo-tech worlds that
should have progressed but didnt.

Now, the Imperium does appear to have capital markets (Hortalez et Cie will
lend money to planets), and I\'m perfectly prepared to believe they work.

So, whats the answer ? Pocket Empires puts it down to high infrastructure
costs (the downpayment on going up a TL) and cultural factors - if you have
a population with a change-negative culture, then you are going to fail a
bunch of attempts to remould society into a higher-tech model.

Now, I think a theme in development is protectionist trade policies. They
arent enough by themselves (eg Latin America), but every economy that I can
think of industrialised behind a wall of import tariffs, and then went to
Free Trade.

If we assume that the Imperial Elite disapproves of protectionism (the
megacorps becasue it closes off export markets, the military becasue it\'s
hard to blockade an autarky - an economy that does not import), then this
becomes ahhh difficult as a development strategy - to put it bluntly,
either the Imperium will send the IISS in to subtly knock over your
government, or a megacorp will do it for them.

In any case, I think you get more adventure opportunities by assuming lots
of long distance trade.

But the market value of the planet and the land on it reflects the uses
it can be put too.  Logically if using planets is cheaper then using
asteroids more people will use planets.  As the quantity demanded of
planetary farmland goes up so will its market price.  At some point it
should reach market equalibrium with asteroids.

Planets are a good like any other, albeit one that is somewhat difficult
to transport....

I\'m willing to make a bet that Engineer Corps ships have fusion drives
rather than (or possibly in adfdition to) thruster plates. 

You do a quick seismic survey by emplacing geophones and setting off
charges. You also do a pentrating radar scan (which will show the rock
under dry soil and sand, even meters down), and a densitometer scan. 

If the underlying rock checks out ok, and isn\'t too deep, then you have
some ships cruise back and forth with their fusion drives on "low". You
basicly fuse the area into one big chunk of rock (I bet that cooling
times compare favorably with setting times for concrete!). If you need
ity too cool faster, use lasers to drill patterns of holes in the rock.

As an area cools, you carve the blast pits etc into it. And you can be
fairly sure that there aren\'t any buried "surprises" waiting. :-)

Slight problem. You do *not* know the direction the meson beam came
from. Just that it hit a specific ship. That means you don\'t *have*
those "straight lines" to work with.

Second, even if you can infer direction (which won\'t be accurate to
more than a degree or so), you don\'t know *which* site or sub fired.
So you\'ve got a straight line. If it interests with another line of
fire (adjusted for the movement of the planet), that *may* indicate a
meson site. Or it may be the chance intersection of fire lines from two
*different* sites.

Heck, if the sites have comm links with each other, they\'d plane their
for so as to *deliberately* cause intersections, just to mislead you.

I wonder if it\'s possible to design a "ship" that can tunnel thru deep
rock layers fast enough to be of use?

Right now there\'s some tunneling gear that *melts* its way thru the
rocks. The "tunnelling head" is a block of metal and ceramic that\'s
above the melting point of most rocks. And the thing pushes the melted
rock aside to make a tunnel. But they are fairly slow.

Maybe something riding on CG & thrusters, with a *big* fusion gun on
the front? It won\'t care if the tunnel collapses behind it. 

If such is possible, then the meson gun would pretty much have to be a
spinal mount. 

For a different approach, use the gimmick several 1950s SF stories
used. At what TL does it become possible to generate fields that allow
a vehicle to "interpenetrate" solid matter?

random thoughts:


Colonization:  Because there are so many worlds with low pop. I would
assume that opportunities exist for educated people at the "start up"
locations.  New people ariving on world bring lots of baggage.  The
lower the local tech, the more you\'ll have to bring with you.  Free
Traders might be more amenable to these odd cargoes.

Raw materials: Highly processed, mined, milled and machined goods would
be cheaper to import for for a very long time.  Here in Maine our
biggest exports during colonization were wood and ice.  Seemingly common
items, but they filled out-going ships for many years.  Processed items
were the imports: tools, steel, cloth, leather, paper, glass, and lots
of other consumer and business use goods.  Later we exported ships,
fish, furs, furniture and more wood, but milled rather than raw.  To
this day, though, most consumer goods arive from away, simply because
our population could not support competitve manufacturing facilities.
The biggest business sector here is tourism.

Tastes: many newly colonized areas yield one or two special export
items.  The wealthy merchants profiting from the export operation will
import a wide variety of luxury goods, but only in small quantity.  The
Free Trader with marketing savvy has always been able to exploit that
fact IMTU.  The fact that a world is listed as Poor does not mean that a
few tons of luxury dainties would go unsold there.  (Come to think of
it, every Free Trader captain I\'ve reffed had a large furry sidekick.
Hmm, why is that?)

I think you would be better off converting HG into another system (MT,TNE

volume via displacement tons. The other systems all use volume and weight. 
Thus you can design a CT ship like my 25 kiloton battlerider that has maxed 
out armor, 6G man, and a big enough powerplant so that agility is 6 as well. 
This won\'t work in other systems because armor is so friggen\' heavy that 
there is NO way you can squeeze in a power plant big enough that can move the 
"rock" at high G\'s. Having said that; I still like HG/TCS the best because 
it\'s so much easier to design ships than the other systems...

I stumbled across an interesting article:

Spotting the Losers: Seven Signs of Non-Competetive States, Ralph Peters
in Parameters, US Army War College Quarterly, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 1, Sprint 1998, 
p. 36-47

Peters discusses a way to assess how well a state -- or an entire civilization --
will perform in the world economy. He identifies seven factors - "deadly sins". 
The more that apply, the worse the prognosis.

The factors:
	Restrictions on the free flow of information
	The subjugation of women
	Inability to accept responsibility for individual or collective
		failure
	The extended family or clan as the basic unit of social
		organization
	Domination by a restrictive religion
	A low valuation of education
	Low prestige assigned to work

The Clausewitzian trinity (state-people-military) is being replaced by a
new trinity: state-people-information. Historically, information equalled
power; this is the refuge of today\'s "flat-worlders". Restricting information
and denying knowledge is self-crippling. Rejecting information (at least the
"unsound" kind) practically assures that industrialization is unattainable.
Censorship hinders competitiveness. 

Embracing women as equal partners in life doubles the available labor pool.
The US economy now routinely operates at a wartime level of human-resource
committment on a routine basis. Suppressing half the population not only
removes them from productive positions but also wastes the energy spent 
doing so. Allow talent into a work force and you create jobs.

The cult of victimhood holds back entire continents. If you always blame the
CIA when the lights go out, you fail to address the real causes. Whining and
blustering about those "Damn Yanquis!" may make you feel good, but so will
a bottle of Southern Comfort...until the next morning.

When tribalism dominates, choices are not completely rational. You vote for 
Uncle Ali or hire Cousin Luis even if some stranger is the better candidate.
When blood ties rule, you cannot trust the contract, let alone the handshake.

If religion defines the "one true path", that path leads only downward. Either 
the religion must be sufficiently subdued and malleable (e.g. Japan) or be
able to openly coexist with varying forms (e.g. United States), opening the
door for science as an "alternative religion:".

Education is critical. Any society that starves education is a loser. Cultures
that do not see inherent value in education are losers. A culture that cannot
produce a single world-class university is not going to conquer the world in
any sphere.

When the goal of work is possession instead of achievement, leisure instead of
accomplishment, work, itself, is not highly valued. Generally, societies that do
not find work in and of itself "pleasing to God and requisite to Man," tend to
be highly corrupt. The goal becomes the attainment of wealth by any means. On the
other hand, workaholic cultures (e.g., North America above the Rio Grande, Japan, 
South Korea) can compensate for deficits such as lack of natural resources. 
States and cultures "win" just by getting up earlier and putting in eight honest
hours and a little overtime.

- ----
Back to my own words instead of quick and dirty summarizing mixed with quotes:

The author clearly thinks that the United States embodies, in large part, the
model for a successful economic power in the 21st century. He argues that 
you can make an initial assessment of the future potential of states by noting
how many of the seven sins can be attributed to that state. I see where this
could be used to help characterize systems IYTU with regard to their general
economic condition. For example, combine low prestige for work with a low
valuation of education and a dogmatic-religion society and you can expect 
corruption to be very likely and prevalent. Remember your "gifts" for the
nice officer...

That is something that is as dumb as drop tanks (I never mentioned

you would be unfortable if I agreed with you :-).  However, combined
with drop tanks it has bigger consequences.

Usually there will be a good reason for a merchant to make a running jump -
it could be pressure to get the cargo to market just a bit ahead of the
other guy, or it could be a pirate/navy starship in hot pursuit.  IMTU (that
stands for \'In My Traveller Universe\') I impose a negative DM on the
Astrogator and Pilot tasks for a running Jump, but my Jump rules are
decidedly non-standard.

Jumps in general cause a feeling of discomfort to the traveller.  Some claim
to get used to it, a few even claim to like it.  Most try and sleep through
it.

There is nothing canon that I am aware of regarding the issue, and I know of
many a game that was (ahem) \'compressed\' by encouraging the players to use
multiple jumps to get where the focus of the game was.  But I also try and
encourage the PCs to get *out* of the ship between jumps - how long can you
stare at the same set of walls?  Additionally, IMTU, I have ruled that the
Jump Grid retains a charge after a jump that can take 2 to 7 (1d6 + 1) days
to fully dissipate.  (Although I also sell a Grid Damper to players who are
concerned about it - it discharges the grid twice as fast)  The building of
the charge is cumulative, i.e. consecutive jumps increase the charge and the
time for it to discharge, and it creates a DM on the misjump roll (+1 per
consecutive jump).

I think you might be missing a key point to this method of life support.  It has to be a closed
system.  They don\'t just produce food out of nothing, they take your wastes and recycle it back into
food.  If you take the food out and don\'t return the biological waste products, the whole thing will
die after one cycle.

What\'s the difference between a collapsible tank and a drop tank? Sure, one

Except that when you blow them away they don\'t count towards your mass when

An ongoing series of articles about the Darmine Minor Human Race

[A note on sources and canonicity.  Small portions of these articles draw directly on past
Traveller products, most notably the CT Alien Modules (especially #5), Adventure 12 and
the MegaTraveller Library data.  The existence of the Darmine Race is canon but most of
the details given here are not cannon.  Traveller is copyright by Far Future Enterprises and
Marc Miller]

Part I -  The Time of the Ancients

[Data from Part I  of this article is mostly  unknown to the population of the Third
Imperium, although large parts of it have been surmised by Darmine scientists.]

Approximately - 300,0000 the Ancients visited Terra.  They took groups of humans with
them to other worlds.  Most of these human races were not genetically altered for their new
homes.  Some of them, including the Darmine, were.

The Darmine homeworld is Ishag  1323 Zarushagar.  Second Survey Statistics for Ishag
follow:   Ishag         1323 B525966-A  N Hi In              515 Im G1 V

In the time of the Ancients Ishag had an atmosphere of standard density.  Ishag is somewhat
unusual in that it has a density of about 1.7 times the standard as do several other planets in
its solar system and other nearby solar systems.  This anomaly is apparently due to several
supernovas in the area resulting in the local interstellar media being somewhat denser than
normal.  This unusual phenomena attracted the attention Grandfather and had a base built on
Ishag to investigate this in about -302,000.  The Grandchild assigned to this task, 
Bryoiasvarv, brought a number of Droyne and hominids with him to assist in these
investigations.  The Ancient base on Ishag was not isolated from the environment but
interacted with it.  The Droyne were easily able to protect themselves from the unusually
high levels of heavy metals present in the soil and air using their technology.  However
they were not able to protect their hominid servants as easily and they began to die off.

This was a slight inconvenience to Bryoiasvarv, but his own interests were in stellar
phenomena, and he instructed the Droyne technicians to solve this problem. 

 The results were somewhat lacking in elegance.  When the Droyne technicians began their
work the hominid servants their population had already dropped from approximately 1,000
to less than 80 individuals.  The technicians determined that the primary cause of hominid
death was do to exposure to the planets heavy metals.  As they had been instructed to cure
the problem they choose to genetically alter the hominids rather than rely on technological
protection from that environment.  They altered their immune systems so that the immune
systems would take active measures to seek out any harmful or intruding substances and
remove them from the body.  The simplest means of disposing of these heavy metals was to
ensure that they were added to the hair and fingernails.  The altered hominids were
released onto Ishag and seemed to thrive in the atmosphere that had been killing them
before.  Several years went by and the droyne gradually realized that the hominids were no
longer breeding at all.  Upon investigation they discovered that the improved immune
systems of the females were attacking and eliminating almost all the male sperm and all of
the few blastocysts that were formed.  The technicians altered the protoDarmine immune
system so that it would no longer eliminate healthy embryos.  However the problem of the
female protoDarmine immune systems elimination of almost all of the sperm entering their
bodies proved impossible for the technicians [remember that Droyne are not very smart or
creative] to cure.  In the end the technicians made an end run around the problem by simply
drastically increasing the reproductive drives of the protoDarmine.

By the time the technicians had finished these tasks the Darmine population had dwindled
to less than 50 individuals.  Furthermore the genetic engineering performed by the droyne
included almost eliminating the introns in their DNA.  The Ancients also made a few other
minor alterations to the Darmine.  Because of the small, genetically undifferentiated,
population the Darmine suffered a number of mental quirks.  Furthermore since the immune
systems of Darmine women were designed to accept "healthy" embryos and healthy was
defined by the droyne technicians as "meeting the required parameters" the female Darmine
immune system was very likely to eliminate any mutated offspring.  Therefore the amount
of genetic drift possible in Darmine is quite limited.  Genetic testing by contemporary 
Darmine scientists indicate very few distinctions between modern Darmine and those of
300,000 years ago save for those caused by interbreeding with other human races, which is
rarely successful in Darmine.

The Darmine servants continued to thrive on Ishag.  Under the relatively benign control of
the droyne many Darmine left the vicinity of the Ancient base.  Over the next 1,000 years
the Darmine population increased to about 100,000 due primarily to the genetically
induced vast enthusiasm for this process.  When the Final War began Yaskodray instructed
Bryoiasvarv to leave Ishag.  Bryoiasvarv, who was still loyal to Yaskodray did so, taking
the droyne with him but leaving the Darmine on their new home.  With no Ancients of
Droyne on the planet the Final War never touched Ishag.  Therefore Ishag had more
remaining Ancient Artifacts then most other human minor race homeworlds.

The old books at least say that you might feel a wrenching or nauseating
sensation.  In the case of a misjump, or if the jump bubble fails for a
moment, many will become violently sick.

It\'s more a safety issue.  You need to check your jump drives to make
sure that they handled the transition back to normal space ok -- no
cracked zuchai crystals, lanthanum grid not breached, no microscopic
fractures of the engine block or pistons, that type of thing.

"People", yes -- but don\'t forget that jump generally kills jgd-il-jagd,
unless they are heavily shielded.  This, and canonical references to
feeling something when you jump, suggests that the jump bubble is
permeable or something.

Also, jump space is supposed to be quite sickening to look at, probably
like Larry Niven\'s blind spot effect.

	The sidebar on pg.22 of Far Trader lends some support to this 
interpretation:

"One of the curiosities of the <I>GURPS: Traveller<I> universe is why 
the low tech worlds do not seem to catch up technologically over the 
centuries.  The GURPS tech level price discount rules used as they are in 
<I>GURPS: Traveller<I> offer us a potential explanation.  Engaging in 
interstellar trade with worlds of higher tech level <I>reduces<I> the 
economic incentive for a world to stretch its technological capabilities or 
even produce everything it is currently capable of because higher tech 
worlds will always be able to do it more cheaply.  The only thing the high 
tech worlds cannot compete with low tech worlds on is the production of low 
tech goods.  This retards the technological advancement of low-tech worlds.  
GM\'s are free to interpret this observation however they like.  Those who 
prefer a more "illuminated" background may decide this is all part of the 
Conspiracy, while others may believe that it is merely an unfortunate 
economic truth."

OT:  Many people seem to be of the impression that protectionism is 
"unamerican" and therefore to be frowned upon.  In fact, it was none other 
than Alexander Hamilton who suggested the idea of protecting America\'s 
"infant industries" from foreign trade until they were strong enough to 
compete. (IIRC it was in his report while Treasury Secretary "On 
Manufactures.")  His writings had more influence abroad than at home, and 
are said to have been one of the intellectual forces behind Germany\'s 19th 
century industrial policy.  Since Japan was in turn heavily influenced by 
German policies the impact of Hamilton\'s ideas could be said to have been 
felt well into this century.

The megacorps have an obvious vested interest in keeping their oligopoly in 
technology intact, but it would be a misguided or short-sighted Imperium 
that discouraged well-considered economic development plans even if they 
included protectionism.  This is not to suggest that the Imperium or its 
representatives are neither misguided nor short-sighted, but rather to point 
out that keeping worlds low-tech backwaters is not in the Imperium\'s 
interest.  Not only are low-tech worlds less able to contribute to military 
production, but they are actually less dependent on trade than high-tech 
worlds (see my previous arguments in an earlier thread).  Since the more 
worlds need trade the more they need the Imperium, it is manifestly in the 
Imperium\'s interest to promote technological development of member worlds.  
The fact that we see little evidence of this is likely a result of the 
Imperium\'s "hands-off" philosophy toward individual worlds coupled with 
simple neglect.  We could imagine that development programs might have been 
one of the positive outcomes of Dulinor\'s proposed reforms.

His factor\'s have a fairly good bearing with reality,
but - like all the work\'s of Man - falls somewhat
short of the mark.  See below....

AKA, the suppresson of truth.

What is "subjugation of women" ?  If Peters is
assuming Islamic-style oppression, sure.
If he mean the existence of standard sex-roles, false:
that\'s just a temporary and necessary division of
labour to raise children.  I would hardly call
Japanese or the pre-1960\'s West a failure.

Moreover, matriarchal cultures are more a sign of
failure than success: observe their rarity in history (an implicit
sign of non-viability), and the poor operation of the
only matriarchal culture I\'m familiar with, the inner-city.

<Shrug> You have to trust someone, and when you are
poor, it\'s wiser to trust nearby relatives than strangers.
Of course, if you cannot trust strangers, your economy
simply cannot grow past a certain point.

Atheistic ideology will do just as well: ask the Russians.

Shall we thank the Benedictine monks, or the Calvinist\'s,
for the high prestige of work in the West?

The Soviet Union industrialized quite nicely under the most oppressive

is merely impossible.

Heh.  "Suppressing half the population not only removes them from productive
positions...." There are a large number of women who would rightfully
resent the implication that they were "oppressed" into starting
families, or that raising children is not a productive activity.

If a women believes that obtaining material wealth now is more
important than raising a family, that is her choice to make, but
please don\'t claim that there is no cost to society in her
deciding to do so.  As an example, consider Europe in, say, 2030....

This particular artifact of Modernity is dying fast, from South America

however.

To the people in that situation, tribalism is completely rational.  Do you
trust  Uncle Ali, who you have known since the age of five? Or some
wealthy stranger, who you can\'t hold responsible for his actions?

Moreover, Uncle Ali is part of your culture: communication is a breeze,
and you are both under the same authority - the local village headman, for
example.  If the stranger cheats you and dissapears, how do you
get justice?  You DON\'T, that\'s how.

Yes, this situation can change, but only after the local\'s are satisfied
that they and the stranger are on a level playing field, not before.

>If religion defines the "one true path", that path leads only downward.

AKA "All religions which claim to be true must fail."  Now, if that
isn\'t a power grab in the name of the current Tolerance ideology,
I don\'t know what is.

All religions and ideolgies MUST define the One True Path.  For
example, the Tolerance crew must and will insist that everyone
must be Tolerant: no exceptions.  Tolerance is the One True Path.

>Either the religion must be sufficiently subdued and malleable (e.g. Japan)
>or be able to openly coexist with varying forms (e.g. United States),

And of course, Science will ascend to it\'s rightful place as the only way
to truth there is, crushing those evil, supersitious Christian\'s under
it\'s unstoppable drive to power.  As humanity walks under the light of
Reason, the Scientific State will usher in a utopia of peace and prosperity,
elevating all sophisticated, intelligent people to a higher state of
Evolution.

Didn\'t we actually see this movie already?

Anyways, Science as Religion has become pretty much a washout
in this century: it isn\'t really bright to worship hammers, and the
scientific method is just that: one of many useful tool\'s for the intellect,
nothing more.

Well, of course.  The British officer in the Punjab thought that his Empire
would grow yet stronger and stronger, the Romans actually thought
that Rome would rule eternally, etc.

ALL major, dominant societies ALWAYS think that they are The Final Society.

This particular example fail\'s the reality check.   Observe the Clinton

Well, of the seven point\'s listed in the post, I agreed with
four,  and had conditional agreement of three, mainly
mainly due to definition\'s of terms: religion/ideology,
subjugation/sex-roles, and the usefullness of the clan.

Not so bad, for a work of the 1990\'s.  I\'m sure that
a University student of 2050 will burst into laughter
at  the current academic culture, but would his idea\'s
be any better?  We\'ll see....

Why do I have a feeling that if you took a black globe generator capable of
shielding a city, and put in and a huge contra-grav generator in the middle
of that city and flipped them both on, you\'d have a airbourne city?

Wet navy ships don\'t need huge fuel tanks. Just small ones to enable
the ship to keep running while repairs are made to their high speed
fuel purifiers.

Well, true enough, he *did* have such. But they became outdated in the
late 50s or early 60s when he switched from wrist radios to wrist TVs.
So don\'t crow *too* loudly until you can point to a wrist videophone.

BTW, there\'s some fun alternate tech for your Traveller campaign.
Magnetic propulsion (The Atomic Space Coupe, and the like). 

Yes, I *did* start reading the comics about the time Dick Tracy and

What makes you think they aren\'t?

More seriously, jump drives can\'t be "worked on" until we have research
facilities beyond the 100 diameter limit.

I want somebody to restart the DC-Y work. And go on to build the DC
Clipper.

You know the smart thing to do would be to power the meson cannon on
the subs externally.  Plant a large number of "charging stations"
on the sea floor all connected to deeply buried and widely dispersed
power plants.  The subs are battery powered, stealthed, and very hard
to detect.  It would dock with a station download targetting data,
position the ship aimming at the target and fire.  Then it is free
to undock and move to its next firing station.

It\'s worse than that. Figure out transit times from one of the gas
giants to the mainworld. For example, at closest approach, it\'s 4.2 AU
from Jupiter to Terra. At 1 g, if you boost until halfway, flip, and
decelerate the rest of the way (so you arrive more or less at rest with
respect to Terra, it takes almost 6 *days*. At 2 g, a bit over 4 days.
3.4 days at 3g, 2.9 days at 4 g, 2.6 at 5g, 2.4 days at 6g.

During this period your fleet is *painfully* visible. And your course
is very predictable. Enough so that the defenders are likely going to
risk firing mass driver projectiles as "kinetic kill" ordinance in your
path. And firing missiles to act as mines. At *some* point, you\'ll
encounter these. But when? :-)

You obviously have to make up your mind how it works and stay consistent.

IMTU, the jump is instantaneous, but one week wait is required
before the ship reenters normal space.  So, for me, the important
thing is where are the objects at the time of jump.  If an object\'s
location at that instant "masks" the target the ship will stop at
the intervening object, but no one aboard will know that until the
ship emerges a week later.

Nope.  Is it on the web somewhere?  What design system?  

What\'s tipped the scales in this argument, for me, is that all of the people 
plugging and chugging numbers have shown it\'s not the end of interstellar 
economics, as we know it, even w/o a massive PR war, disaster, sabotage, etc, 
which would really reign them in for awhile.  While they should one day 
become the norm for interstellar travel, there is no reason it *has to* take 
place in an amount of time that will significantly impose its effects on 
anyones TU.

It\'s the particulars of the column shifting that I find dubious.  Meson guns 
come in at TL-11.  Even without them, orbital bombardment should be nasty.  
Command of space is priceless.  You can bombard w/ lasers etc from far 
ranges.  Can always drop rocks, too.  Forget bout the near c kind...  see 
"Footfall."  YMMV.

This came up in one of my old campaigns, the PC\'s wanted to refit to the
stage that the ship performed like it was new and insisted I come up with a
formula on the spot.  We agreed that the annual maint. cost multiplied by
every 10-year age block or part thereof plus 10% would be assumed to be a
decent refit/overhaul.  Mind you, I was never a gearhead like some on this
list may be, so it\'s open to debate, but back then it was a quick fix for a
on off situation that worked.

An ongoing series of articles about the Darmine Minor Human Race

[A note on sources and canonicity.  Small portions of these
articles draw directly on past Traveller products, most notably
the CT Alien Modules (especially #5), Adventure 12 and the
MegaTraveller Library data.  The existence of the Darmine Race
is canon but most of the details given here are not cannon.
 Traveller is copyright by Far Future Enterprises and Marc Miller]

The population of Ishag at the time of the Ancients departure was about
100,000 individuals at TL 0 [All Tech levels in these articles are 
Traveller Tech levels, not GURPS Tech Levels.] Over the next 150,000
years the population grew to 10,000,000 to 20,000,000 and Tech Level
1, including an alphabet was created.  Ishag is, save for its heavy
metaltaints which the Darmine were engineered to withstand, a mild
planet with little climatological or animal threats.  During this period
Darmine science advanced quite slowly but its spiritual and cultural
traditions were quite advanced.

Due to Ancient genetic alteration and the forerunner effect from its
small population base the Darmine were quite prone to developing
spontaneous  psionic potential without training, of which Precognition
was most common, especially in women.  This ability to see the future
combined with use of Ancient artifacts and the numerological obsessive
compulsions common in the Darmine resulted in a population that was
deeply spiritual and which was heavily constrained by massive amount of
tradition and taboos.  Circa -30,0000 the Darmine had been reached early
Tech Level 2 via a steady, but very slow process, and the Darmine had
completely explored their world.  Up until this point their had been
little or no long range communication on Ishag save for incidental
communication of wanderers and that of telepaths.  In about -27,000 the
printing press was invented.  The primary use of the press was in
publishing scripture.  As the Darmine came to learn that their neighbors
had different beliefs then they did a growing spirit of intolerance and
evangelicalism swept the planet.  By -25,000 the Darmine discovered
war.  In the next 1,000 years their culture climbed from Tech level 2,
Tech level 1 in Military fields up to TL 6 and planetary  population had
climbed to over 400,000.  In addition the Darmine had found and learned
how to use a significant number of Ancient Artifacts, including psionic
disintegrators.

Circa -23,500  the Darmine First and Second Thermonuclear Wars 
brought their population back below 500,000, their TL back to 0, and the 
apparent destruction of all known Ancient weapons. The war resulted in a
 technophobic reaction in a significant minority of all Darmine.  Even
today  about 5% of all Darmine shun modern technology. However the
Darmine  had an written tradition 125 thousand  years old at his point. 
With the aid  of the knowledge in these books  Darmine society began its
slow technological recovery and had regained  late TL 4 by  -22,500. 
However  the Darmine rate of population growth is somewhat slower than
that of other human races and their planetary  population was still less
than 10,000,000. The nuclear wars eliminated all formal Darmine
knowledge of Psionics. Some Darmine still spontaneously manifested
Psionic powers, especially Precognition.  [Referees Modern Darmine will
spontaneously  develop Precognition is 4d6 all turn up sixes and other
psionic powers  if 5d6 all turn up sixes in women, in men one additional
d6 turning up 6 is required.]

Darmine society continued to progress technologically at a very slow
rate and by -6,000 Darmine technology had reached early Tech Level 8 
although military technology was only tech level 5, perhaps do to
revulsion at what war had done to Ishag.  It was at this point that the
Vilani first contacted the Darmine, and vice versa.

Sorry, but it has been determined by experiment that light-weight chain
mail is *not* a good idea. Someone in the SCA made some out of aluminum
instead of steel. Since SCA weapons don\'t have *real* cutting edges,
the softness of the metal didn\'t matter. But he discovered that the
*mass* of the chain is part of the protection factor. By *being*
massive, it helps absorb the impact. 

On the other hand, something like that might be ok as an "overshirt" to
wear over your Kevlar. As numerous people have learned the hard way,
kevlar is not knife proof!

There\'s nothing "official" about this. If you want to, you can throw in
something about a strange twisting sensation or some such.

Well, you *do* have to determine where you *are*. You might have
misjumped, in which case this might take a while. Or you could be in
the right system but pretty far from your intended exit point. 

So first priority upon exiting jump is getting an astrogational fix.
This shouldn\'t take long if the system is very developed. You can
basicly get a fix on nav beacons. If you misjumped, or the system
doesn\'t have beacons, it could take anywhere from an hour to a day.

Actually, even *current* TL sensors could spot planets easily. The
trick is that you have to be in *space* with them. Easy for a Traveller
merchant. Not so easy for us.

We\'ve been over this before and a decent space-based observatory could
plot most planets from a sector or more away. Ship sensors can probably
plot GGs from more than 6 parsecs. And "normal" planets are possible.

Of course the *real* problem is that the way *most* of these planets
are being discovered are by comparing observations made over a period
of *years*. Direct observation is a *lot* trickier and tends to require
gear that won\'t *fit* on a small ship.

So, roughly speaking, because the established worlds can produce the stuff
for less than you can tool up to produce it, your infant manufacturing
sector never really gets going.

Sounds workable to me.  Also sounds close enough to GATT and NAFTA to keep
my players happy.  (Mind you, as left-wing teenagers, this crowd\'s take on
economics is rather odd anyway!)

The word "normal" might be a bit provocative, but G:T _is_ the new kid on
the block. Four versions of Traveller use "TL" to mean the same thing, G:T
is the only version that\'s different.

I use GTL for GURPS Tech Level, TL for Traveller tech level. Saves having
to change 20+ years of material.

To a newcomer this probably won\'t matter as much, except that they might

Well, I now have a copy of GT: Far Trader, and can get other books
fairly soon (at the end of the month).  I am hoping that I can get this
posted
as-is on Freelance Traveller, and perhaps my Mercenary adventure
last October as well.

As for Loren... well, my best bet is to publish it in Pyramid.  I ain\'t a
subscriber,
but I do have my $15 US money order ready.  As this is a merchant adventure,
it really should have some money number\'s on it, to save the Referee some
hassle.

Yeah, they are middle-class vouchers.  Your idea look\'s interesting, and

Actually, it\'s set just post-FFW in 1112. (Fifth Frontier War: 1107 - 1110).
If your player\'s want even more firefight\'s, cutting-edge action,
and hair\'s breath escapes, set it in 1107 instead.

The 20mmIAAW is a collapsing railgun firing a depleted uranium dart.  The
entire weapon is a little over 30cm in length, and 5cm wide.  It includes a
laser sight, and can mount a scope or HUD targeting link.

The weapon is disposable, burning out it\'s batteries and rail after one
shot.  Usual practise is to issue the weapon as an unit of ammo, one to
each soldier.

The weapon as designed is available at GTL 10.

Average damage for the weapon is 504 points.  With the armor divisor,
effective armor penetration is 2520 points of armor.  For example, a IAAW
hitting a suit of Scout/Commando BD would do: (Armor 1200/5 = 240) 264
points of damage to the suit and it\'s occupant.  It is imporatant to note
that you can buy 304 of these weapons for every suit of S/C Battledress...

Note:  This weapon is as large as is it is only to avoid Acc and SS
penalties.  It could easily be made into a pistol sized weapon.

A Traveller Play by EMail Roleplaying Game

Gateway Sektor. Es ist das Jahr 1119 seit Grndung des Imperiums. Die imperiale 
Prsenz ist so gut wie nicht vorhanden. Das Imperium betrachten diesen Sektor als 
Pufferzone. Aber eine andere Gefahr droht diesem Sektor. Im Jahre 1106 griff eine 
berlegen Raumflotte, des Xuruk Empires, einem K\'kree Splitterstaat, die 
unterlegen Verteidigungsflotte der Renkard Union bei Xabthar an. Kurz darauf 
besetzten sie die gesamte Union. Es sieht sehr danach aus, das sie den axavktrr 
xur einhalten, was sich etwa als berleben durch gerechte Ausrottung bersetzen 
lsst. Dies heisst nichts anderes, als die Auslschung aller Fleischfresser 
(=g\'naak) im Universum. Das benachbarte Megusard Corporate sieht sich als 
mgliches nchstes Opfer.

Viele Menschen meinen etwas tun zu mssen, einige der exil-Renkards haben sich 
auf Kolan zusammengetan. Diese Rebellengruppe wird Force Bravo genannt. 
Der Gateway Sektor war schon immer ein unruhiger Sektor. Besiedelt in der Long 
Night, war er immer wieder mit verschieden militrischen Auseinandersetzungen 
konfrontiert. Bisher wurden diese aber immer zwischen Menschen ausgetragen. Der 
Sektor wird von einer Jump 2 Route, dem Gateway-Sardis-Run, durchzogen.

3D Spielmechanik?

Wir spielen in einem 3D Sektor. Dieser kann mit CHVIEW (OS/2, Win NT, Win 3.11, 
Win \'98) betrachtet werden. Der Sektor besitzt etwa 4500 Einfach- und 
Mehrfachsonnensystem. Der Sektor GATEWAY.LST liegt aber bisher nur als draft vor, 
wird aber stndig erweitert. Die Region um Kolan und Sardis ist aber schon fertig. 
An einem vollstaendig neuem Programm wird aber fieberhaft gearbeitet. Zur 
verbesserung der Spielmechanik wurde der Jumpdrive auf Jump1=2parsec bis 
Jump6=7parsec erhoeht.

Welche Traveller Version wird benuzt?

Als Regelwerk wird MegaTraveller mit DGP Materialien verwendet mit sehr vielen 
eigenen nderungen. Die Charakterbgen liegen mit einem Ausrstungs- und 
Waffenkatalog im StarOffice 5.0 bei mir vor, kann aber auch in Exel, html, txt 
oder etc. exportiert werden. Wir legen mehr Wert auf Spielflu als auf eine 
berinterpretation von einem Regelwerk.

Was fr eine Art von Campaign ist Lords of Thunder?

One of the best adventures of any RPG, in my opinion. An epic campaign in an 
Imperial client state combining trade, mercenaries, espionage, piracy, scientific 
research, exploration, alien civilizations, one huge fleet battle, and the 
revelation of a Traveller Secret. This is the only Traveller adventure I have seen 
that makes pirates believable, and the only one that reveals a Secret which isn\'t 
implausibly contrived to draw the player characters into it. It would be a great 
adventure even if the players only sat back and watched news reports, but they can 
do far better for themselves by rushing into the thick of things. von Richard 
Hough <rdhough@home.com>

Gibt es eine allgemeine Stichwortliste?

Es gibt eine Traveller Library.

Wie erhalte ich mehr Campaign bezogen Informationen?

Es gibt eine Sektor Library.

Was ist denn bisher passiert?

Es gibt ein Timeline.

Wie werden die Fahrzeuge erstellt?

Raumschiffe, Vehicle, Roboter werden ueber eine MT Variant Spreedsheet von mir, 
auch nach Wunsch erstellt.

Kann ich Galactic verwenden?

Alle UWP Daten aus Galactic haben hier fast keine Bedeutung, da alle System und 
Planeten neu erstellt werden.

Wie zeitintensiv ist das Spiel?

Prinzipiell solltest Du mglichst werktags deine Emails lesen und beantworten 
knnen. Der Arbeitsaufwand liegt in etwa bei einem fnfstze Absatz pro Tag. Das 
Spiel lebt von dem, was die Spieler schreiben. Die Spieler agieren, der 
Spielmeister dirigiert. Wir legen meist den Schwerpunkt auf die Interaktion der 
Spieler untereinander. Als Neuling knnen wir aber verschiedene herangehensweisen 
benutzen.

Wer leitet das Spiel?

Kann ich mal ein Textbeispiel sehen?

Spieler: B., H. und viele Kopfschmerzen und Krabbeltiere
Ort: Wo es feucht und warm ist.
Zeit: auf jeden fall sehr viel spaeter

Ihr befindet euch in einem Erdloch, die Luft ist feucht und warm, unten bei euch 
ist eine Wasserlache. Ihr seit dreckig einige fetzen haengen euch noch am Leib. 
Wenn ihr eure Koerper inspiziert findet ihre mehre einstichloecher, ob von Insekte 
oder medizinischen Geraeten, koennt ihr nicht unterscheiden. Von draussen hoert 
ihr geschrei, wie als ob jemand ausgepeitscht wird....

B.: Habe ich goessere Wunden, die ich sofort versorgen muss? - liegt hieretwas, 
das ich als Waffe benutzen kann? - hat H. irgendwelche besonderen Merkmale, die 
vorher durch die Kleidung verdeckt wurde? - Wer schreit Mann Frau Unbekannt 
Sprache? - werden wir bewacht? - wenn nein,Wege raus suchen und nutzen, sonst 
Wachen beobacheten! Hat H. irgendwelche besonderen Merkmale, die vorher durch die 
Kleidung verdeckt wurde? 

Nein H. sieht schwach aus!

Wer schreit? Wahrscheinlich S.

Werden wir bewacht? Warst noch nicht in der lage, dass zu klaeren.

B.: Habe ich goessere Wunden, die ich sofort versorgen muss? 

Nein dein Zustand ist wie folgt Modifier STR -4 DEX -4 END -4 INT -2 (SOC zur zeit 
eher = 0 ;-])

Du hast Kopfschmerzen. H. sieht aehnlich aus, ist aber nicht so robust wie du.
Eigentlich nichts Ernstes nur Schwaeche. Einen richtige Arzt wuerde ich aber 
empfehlen. Man weiss ja nie!

A.: Fremde Frau spricht auf R. Dialekt: Hallo Brueder! Ich bin A.. Wollt ihr mit 
oder versauern? Koennt ihr gehen? Eines kann ich euch sagen eure Vorgaenger modern 
gerade vor sich hin. Hindert euch sonst was an einer Flucht? Wieviele Bewacher 
sind hier? Wie sind sie bewaffnet? Ich weiss das ist ein bisschen viel so auf 
einmal, aber ich habe keine Zeit fr ein Kaffekraenzchen.

Die Frau ist dreckig, kraeftig gebaut und mit Machete und Shotgun bewaffnet. Und 
ungeduldig und erwartet eine zuegige Antwort. H. ist am rumstoehnen.

B. (Zu der Frau gewand): Wir schliessen uns an! Wer seid Ihr? Und ueberhaupt wo 
sind wir?

A.: Ihr habt keinen blassen Schimmer was? Ihr seid auf K. Noch genauer im F. 
Flussdelta in der Naehe vom Raumhafen und der Hauptstadt.

Die Frau beginnt waehrend sie redet H. aus dem Loch zu ziehen und ihn nach 
gebrochenen Knochen zu untersuchen. Dann hilft sie auch B. heraus und nimmt ihn 
ebenfalls etwas naeher in Augenschein.

A.: Ich bin wie ich schon sagte A. Das muss euch jetzt reichen. Also wisst ihr 
ungefaehr wieviele von den Verraetern hier herum stromern? Ich habe mit denen noch 
ein oder zwei Huenchen zu rupfen!"

Dann reicht A. B. ihre Shotgun. Hier ich hoffe du kannst damit umgehen. Ist hier 
nicht noch ein Gefangener? Ihr wart doch zu dritt hier angeliefert worden.

Mit den Worten nimmt Sie H. auf den Arm.

B. an A.: Wer sind die Verraeter?

A.: Ist eine laengere Geschichte. Erklaer ich dir wenn wir lebend aus dieser 
Scheisse raus sind. Aber es wuerde mir sehr leid tun wenn du dumm sterben 
wuerdest.

B. an A.: Ich werde mein bestes geben! Ich glaube, unser dritter Mann wird gerade 
gefoltert hoeren sie das nicht? Aber ich bin mir nicht vollkommen sicher, da sich 
mein Kopf anfuehlt als ob er in einen Mixer gesteckt wurde.

A.: Sagte ich nicht das ich A. heisse? Also gut dann bringe ich euch beide 
erstmal in sichere Entfernung. Euren Freund hole ich dann etwas spaeter.

B.: Koennen sie mir sagen, was dieses fuer Einstiche sind (ich deute auf die 
Wunden)?

H.: (stoehnt) Drooog..%&%$/

A.: Nee, Grosser ich bin hier nicht die Frau Doc vom Dienst. Und jetzt Klappe 
halten bis ich sage das ihr wieder reden duerft. Das gilt besonders fuer deinen 
Freund hier. (A. deutet auf H-)

Ich (A.) gehe davon aus das du mir moeglichst lautlos durch die Nacht folgst, bis 
wir an einem kleinen Boot stoppen.

A. hievt H. in das Boot und deckt ihn zu. Sie reicht B. Wasser (H. auch) und ein 
Butterbrot. 

A. zu B.: Wie heissen du und deine Freunde eigentlich? Und woher kommt ihr?

A. setzt sich an das Boot und laesst B. etwas Zeit zum Ausruhen. Nach ein paar 
Minuten kramt sie aus ihrem Rucksack im Boot drei Handgranaten hervor.

A. zu B.: Wollen wir jetzt deinen dritten Freund von den Verraetern erloesen?

B. zu A.: Ich bin B. und komme bzw. wurde hier hergekommen von S.

An Meister: Ich beobachte die Umgebung sehr genau. Sind wir wircklich auf K., was 
sagen die Himmelskoerper? Wie geht D. vor, militaerisch, rebellisch? Was fuer eine 
Ausbildung hat sie wohl? -- Was fuer ein Boot ist das? -- Besitzt A. irdendwelche 
Auffaellichkeiten -- Haben wir viele Spuren hinterlassen? -- Waren wir in einem 
grossen Lager?

Ah, but it\'s always different when your own country does it. My country is
protecting its infant industries, your country is favouring its own
companies, and their country is interfering with the free flow of trade for
selfish reasons.

And, speaking as a nonamerican, I at least don\'t frown on unamerican things :-)

<snip>

You know, there are times when I wish that I was much more witty and
harsh than I am.  This is one of those times.  Does anyone have any
really clever wordplay about this spam?

2) That *other* Imperium and the Spinward Marches.

Fairly recently, I obtained a copy of Paul Johnson\'s
"The Offshore Islanders: A History of the English People".
And of course, the first chapter dealing with Rome and
England immediately put me in mind of our beloved
Third Imperium and that far-away chunk of the Empire, the
Spinward Marches.

Here, in brief, is the outlines of a dying empire and how the
local yokel\'s respond to it (summaries and near-quotes of
Johnson, basically)

A) As the end of the 300\'s approached, Roman had withdrawn
it\'s pernament garrison\'s , only sending in occassional
military expedition\'s to assert their authority

*****
*
* Date of comments: 1260
*
* Spinward Marches parallel: Most of the Imperial Navy
* is withdrawn from the Marches, with the bulk of the defence
* falling on local Colonial Navy units and fixed defences.
* Only when the Zho seem to be acting up does the
* Emperor send in a few fleet\'s, to show the flag.
* Depending on your assumptions, pirating
* (Dynastic/corporate/intersystem warfare IMTU) goes through
* the roof.
*****

B) The decline of Roman authority produced two seperate
strain\'s of political thought in Britain.  On one side was those
who thought that the Empire would eventually succeed in it\'s
fight against the barbarians, and return in force to Britain.
They thought that without Rome, internal order would collapse,
their lives and property would be forfeit, and the economy would
collapse.  The only real hope in their eyes lay in reforging Roman
ties, and get Rome back into Britain in strength.  Seperated from
the rest of the Empire, Britain would drift into anarchy, poverty and
failure.

*****
* Many powerful Spinward leader\'s understood that the Imperium
* was the best thing to happen to Mankind in an long, long time.
* Without the Imperium, the rule of all-against-all, suppressed
* so long by the Navy, would explode in full force creating
* profound loss of life and property.  Moreover, the Zho\'s are just waiting
* over the border, hungry to enslave and mindrape the Marches,
* crushing a thousand year\'s of freedom under their boots.
* The Marches will only survive if the Imperium survives, and everything
* that can be done to regain pernament Imperial Navy fleet\'s must be done.
*****

Onthe other hand, the nationalist\'s believed that the forces destroying the
Roman Imperium could not be stopped at this late date: that it was simply
wishful thinking to believe that Rome would return, and that Britain was
alway\'s unimportant and expendable in Rome\'s eyes.  What Imperial
officer\'s that Rome sent was "far more interested in carving up sub-empires
for themselves back on the Continent than to protect British lives and
property".  They took their vitally needed military forces out of Britain
and
made themselves little fiefdoms in Gaul.

*****
* The other political grouping in the Marches - led by intellectual\'s, but
* also joined by many nobles - believed that nothing would
* save the Imperium.  Somehow, local forces would have to be
* raised to replace the departed Imperial fleet\'s, and independence
* will be proclaimed to prevent the latest Emperor of the Flag
* from stealing them to suppress the next rebellion.
*****

In 406, the British forced the leader of the weak Roman garrison to
declare himself local Emperor.  This was quite illegal, but made sense
to the British, who desperately wanted military protection.

"When, four month\'s after his appointment, Gratian made it plain they
had to stay in Britain, they murdered him: instead, they gave the
command to a new and foreign usurper, who called himself
Constantine III; and he took all the regular units across the
Channel to create a Gallic empire."

*****
* In 1255, the Moot of the Spinward Marches declared the dissolution
* of the Imperium, and placed Viscount Seagate as head of the new
* Commonwealth of the Marches.  There was deep division within
* the Marches regarding this move, eventually leading to the
* assasination of the Viscount on Jewell.  The Commonwealth
* Admiral forced the nobility to swear alligance to himself as Regent,
* gathered all the jump-capable warship\'s of the Marches, and
* moved to conquer Vland, completely abandoning the despised
* Marches.
*****

"What use to Rome to Britain?  Britain had been for centuries exploited
as an ecomonic colony.  She had been only the barest measure of local
self-government.  If Roman authority was fully re-established, the process
of exploitation would merely resume.  But in the meantime Rome was
impotent, and the time had come to assert British independence."

*****
* With the deep decline of the Marches, there has been a massive flight
* in wealth and population to the Imperial Core regions.  A typical
subsector
* behind the Claw has as large an ecomony as a decent high-pop system
* in the Core: few wish to live in the ruins of the Marches economy.
*****

After the pro-independence party of Britain gained control in 410, they
did "... a unique act of statesmanship.  Having seized power for themselves,
they wrote to Emperor Honorius asking formal and legal authority for what
they had done.  They had got independence de facto: they now wanted it
de jure, a written acknowledgement from the imperial power that Britain
had been decolonised with the permission from the authorities.
More specifically, they wanted exemption from the famous lex Julia de
vi publica, the bedrock statue of the Roman Empire, which forbid civilians
to bear arms except when hunting or travelling.  In due course they got it.
Honorius sent his rescript, or reply, accepting the fait accompli, and
instructing the civitates of Britain to look to their own defences.  Thus
the
ancient world ended, and the independent history of Britain was resumed,
in a throughly legal and constitutional manner.... It was a unique event in
the
history of the Roman Empire; it was based on no precedent, and had no
parallels elsewhere.  For the first time a colony had regained its
independence
by law; and it was to remain the last occasion until, in the twentieth
century, the
offshore islanders began the consitiutional dismantlement of their own
empire."

*****
* A possible goal of the PC\'s in this universe is to convince
* Emperor Emdiri Marlin Alkhalikoi - Emperor Emdiri II, 46th
* Emperor of the Third Imperium -  to reconsitiute the Domain of
* Deneb and make it an autonomous region, much like the
* Solomani Automonous Region that Empress
* Margret I created in 704.
*****

*****
*
* Background
*
* Norris was the first and last Archduke to ever rule the Domain of Deneb.
* The continued growth of internal divisions, trade frictions and
* inter-Imperium warfare led Empress Ciencia Iphegenia Alkhalikoi
* (daughter of Emperor Strephon: born 1088, crowned 1122, died 1142)
* to disband the Domains, replace as many Solomani nobles as possible with
* Sylean and Vilani nobility, and force a centralization of the Imperial
* economy to the vital Vland/Sylea/Terra trade routes.  She also started
* the massive withdraw of capital and military might from "lesser concerns"
* like the Spinward Marches/Zhodani border, back into the Imperial
heartland.
*
* At a different time, she may have become a truly great Empress.  Instead,
* she had her hand\'s full simply keeping the Imperium together.  Ciencia\'s
lack of
* issue caused a long succession crisis, which grew in bitterness.
* At first, the Imperial bureaucracy and the senior members of the
* Alkhalikoi family kept things running while the nobility endlessly

_If_ photons precipitate out of jumpspace when they leave the 
jumpbubble then there is no problem. The ship will absorb the photons 
(there must be photons if there is a visible effect) radiate them in 
addition to the usual radiated heat and the will precipitate out of 
jumpspace.

There is no way that "the jumpspace photons" (probably caused by
some reaction between the jumpbubble and jumpspace) would be a problem
as even small traveller ships are capable of radiating hundreds of 
MW:s Actually jumpspace is as good a heatsink as blackglobes.

Would you remodel your house this way? Say:

down this wall (followed by screaming as the roof collapses). >:-)

It could be _very_ hard to do modify a ship. Maybe the staterooms and 
jumpdrive/fuel tankage/cargo hold are in different/opposite areas of 
the ship. Maybe the staterooms are in different places of the ship or 
there is no access to the hull (for cargo doors).

If you are freeing up a lot of space you are probably forced to 
remove some bulkhead and reinforce others. There could be other 
problems as well with security and removed/moved airtight bulkheads.

To do this you would have to get an engineer, an architect and 
blueprints but for gaming I guess that the deckplans will be 
sufficient. Just remember that you can\'t run around and knock down 
the interior structure any way you like. The designers put the 
bulkhead there for a purpose.

Example:
Take a trader where the lower decks are cargo hold and upper decks 
are the rest. Say that the floor of the staterooms you want to remove 
is the roof of the cargo hold. Remove the staterooms. Now you got a 
more cargo space but in a very inconvenient place several meters in 
the air. And this is a rather nice example as it could be a lot worse.

If your LS system doesn\'t do that automatically then you need a new 
LS system. It\'s unlikely you would have to retune the LS-system to 
keep the crew from fainting if you made a run without passenger.

Actually its even worse. Blackglobes in an atmosphere is abig no-no. 
The blackglobe absorbs all energy so the energy from the atmosphere 
as it is cooled to 0 K will overload the capacitors and blow 
everything up. Possibly it will also absorb potential energy (caused 
by gravity) speeding this up even more.

Well it would become skyhigh at least. :)

I think that what you see when you look at jump space is the interface at
the edge of the jump bubble.  That interface may be somewhat reflective to
the visible spectrum while being highly transmissive to lower frequency EM
emissions like heat.  However, the "supposed" heat build up in jumpspace
may also lend more credence to jump dimming to cut down on heat
production.

OK, the O: 3130 means that Mecca was colonised and is owned by Oceanus,
Reavers\' Deep 3130.  It\'s an agricultural colony, with several of the
Oceanus satrapies present, which explains its government type of
Balkanised.

Last Thursday, David Smart posted news from the BBC about the discovery 
of a multiple-planet system in Upsilon Andromedae. (Someone else -- 
don\'t remember who (sorry!) repeated the info later that day.)

I think I might have found it on my Solomani Rim map.

A few assumptions:
- - uAnd\'s distance of 44 LY from Earth works out to just under 13.5
parsecs. Call it 13 for simplicity\'s sake.
- - The "flattening" of the galaxy for the Traveller map means that the 
most important indicator for finding a star on the map is distance and 
its Right Ascension. uAnd has a RA of 1h 36m 48s.
- - Tau Ceti (Iilike/Solomani Rim 1429) has a RA of 1h 44m 08S, putting
it in the same part of the sky. Upsilon Andromedae would be just a 
little clockwise of Tau Ceti (from Terra\'s perspective) on a Traveller 
map.

The best fit for the above is Skyron/Solomani Rim 0533, which
has a UPP (from Supplement 10: The Solomani Rim) of B312433-C.
Not exactly the French Riviera, but it\'s there. And according to the 
map, gas giants are present. :)

I like this stuff, but I think it\'s actually *more* appropriate for the
First Civil War period ... remember, Arbatrella was the Provincial
General/Governor who successfully took her Fleet home.

I\'m also more inclined to think of the Zhos as the Persians. Vargr as
Germans fits though.

Yeah.  I think GT should make the explination that the mesons

Note: The Vargr are prefectly able to appreciate subletly.  The
difference is in who they see colors (they see some we don\'t,
don\'t see some we do), not in a lack of appriation for subltly.

In fact, my impression of the descriptions of their descernment
in grades of meats (clearly enhanced, not covered, by sauces
or it wouldn\'t matter what the meat was), etc.  lead me to
believe that their tastes may be _more_ subtle than humans.

It should be riterated, canabalism can not be used to substitute

Given the way that foods are presented as being exported (Groat is exported
to the Aslan and Vargr, etc., varies Terran foods are
mentioned as being shared by other major races).  The implication is
that most species use the same amino acids.  (All the major
races must use the same amino acis)  And PC are always visiting
new worlds and having descriptions of the local foods.  If this
was an issue, then it would be raised each time.

This is not unreasonable.  It really isn\'t know either way, but
it could be that there is a prefered orientation.

Hell no!  You don\'t want to _kill_ it.  You want a stun prod to knock it
out so you can do the talk show circuit!  Naturally a tactical marketing
team from Astroburger will be hot on your trail to "remove" the chatting
bovine from disrupting sales.  You should be able to clear at least several
thousand CR before this occurs, though.

	This is kinda like saying that the price of farmland in Florida will 
rise until it is price-competitive to grow oranges at the South Pole.
	Something like this would only happen if the demand for oranges was so 
high that demand could only be served by pulling in land as unproductive as 
Antarctica.  It is much more likely that demand can be satisfied by 
terrestrial farmland at a price far below what asteroid farms would have to 
charge.  If the nearest Ag world is a long way away, some goods relatively 
easy to produce in an Asteroid might be grown, like algae or catfish or 
something.

	Right, which is why you transport the products of a desirable planet 
instead.  You\'ve got the right idea, you just presumed an inelastic price 
and enormous demand.  Your basic idea was right.

    Why must it be in the black market?  Why not have it open.  I can see it

    More good eating is on the way.  *weg*  Think about it, RFK kiosks could
follow 3I Marines & serve up the dead & wounded K\'Kree right there.  I know
it is sick, but hell it would make money.  And, the Vargr Troops would be
happy, K\'Kree bones are not hollow.  So they could knaw on them all day
long.  *eweg*

    No, but if you market it right, Humans, Aslan, & Vargr would.

*applause* Well done! (Were there any other candidates at 14pc 
or at slightly different angles?)

Okay, how do we now go about making sure that the astronomical
community, decades or centuries from now, remembers to name the 
closest-match planet in the u.And system "Skyron" once we manage 
to survey it?

(Don\'t worry if we find a T-norm planet in the system in addition
to a 312, we can always nuke it into uninhabitability later, 
leaving Skyron as the mainworld.)

Well, I\'m willing let those who read this make up their own
minds.  As the whether I have suceeded, you are hardly an

Hans is perfectly capable of saying what he want.  He also seem
more than able to understand my references, we just didn\'t
agree on interpretations.

If you want to try engage me in "posting tatics" arguements on
our threads, that is one thing (I don\'t care for it, but I can
always drop out and we all know how well you claim that you
were right because I was supposedly the only one posting
in oppostion turned out...) but don\'t just drop in on my discussions with
others unless you have a direct point to make (not just to
characterize the discussion negatively).  (Esp. when the
thread has reach a point where were are better off "agreeing
to disagree" and you are only pushing to prolong disucssion
pointlessly).
[More generaly characterizations and a place where Gary didn\'t
understand my point.]

</color>Actually, yes to both:

- - Cadmus (0532, C532423-B), 13 pc from Terra

- - Kraken (0432, C57A587-B), 14 pc from Terra

 


Choosing Skyron over Cadmus was more or less a judgment call on 

my part, based on the angle from Terra. There is a list on the web

at:

	
<bold>http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Corridor/4224/library/solomanistars.html</bold>


called "The Known Star List for the Solomani Rim" which tries to match 
known stars in Sol\'s vicinity to the Traveller map. uAnd. is not 
listed, but a great number are. Eyck/Solomani Rim 0426 is identified on

that list as "Beta Cassiopei", which has a Right Ascencion of just 
about 0h -- and is almost dead-on due spinward from Terra. This gave me

a great reference point to work with.


(Anyone running campaigns in the Solomani Rim should definitely

check out the Known Star List.)

Yes, I picture the meson cannon being like the shore batteries
around harbors during the 18th century.  Shore based guns had a
greater range than ship based cannon, not a *lot* longer range, but
enough to make a real difference.  I can\'t remember a case of
successful assault by sea on a well defended harbor that didn\'t
depend on guile and subterfuge.

Of course, if you have a large enough fleet and are willing to get
to chewed up then you might be able to overwhelm a planet\'s
defenses.  That might be the only thing that works really well
defended planets.

Thanks Kevin, like I said, I have been out of the loop.  I started way back
when with CT\'s LBB\'s whose supplements, adventures, etc. were hard to get
where I live (we are the tourist capital of Australia, if it isn\'t a
souvenir or beach wear... it wasn\'t that common in the late 70\'s, early
80\'s!

We had a go at MT (which was more available by that time), but my players
found it to confusing, especially the technical design method in the first
book for starships.  Even if I persevered, they were not interested in
playing from that media.  Then I even had a go at T:NE, but by that time, we
were running short of gaming time, there were studies in Uni, girlfriends
and/or wives, etc.  So I got out of the gaming scene for quite a while, I
have never seen the colonised data on a UWP before because of that.

Thanks again -- live and continue to learn hey?

Heh.  "Suppressing half the population not only removes them from productive
positions...." There are a large number of women who would rightfully
resent the implication that they were "oppressed" into starting
families, or that raising children is not a productive activity.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The fastest-growing part of the American (and developed-world) economy
is the Service sector. The people who clean our clothes, cook our meals,
care for our children, run our errands, etc.

These tasks have always needed to be done. They were simply done
by people who weren\'t counted in measurements of the economy -
housewives. 

As more and more families saw the "free" housekeeper/nanny/cook
turn into another working parent, the value of this person to the
household has started to become apparent. Especially when the 
replacement value of this person is reflected in a massive increase
in the service economy.

(I\'m not indicating that people are hiring out and out live-in servants,
but every time a family orders a pizza or drops a kid off at day-care
we see a service that cost nothing (because the housewife did it for "free") 
changed to a service that money is paid for and the economists can see.)

ObTrav: a society that creates invisible housekeepers out of half the
population is probably the simplest hidden factor a interplanetary
economist has to deal with.

Kharganian Merchant: "Why should I pay good credits for a washing
machine? My husbands keep the laundry done just fine, and cost me
nothing but food - and I have to feed them anyway, at least until
after breeding season. Make their workload easier? Do you realize how
stupid they\'ll make me look if I start pampering them?"

Ok, if the 3I and the horses go eyeball to halter, what do the Solomani and
Hivers do?  The Solomani might try and get involved in a land grab, but
would the Hivers perhaps try to "mediate" a cease fire or settlement?

This has serious potential for a campaign.  Now all we need is some info on
the cattle ships.

Me too. But "Oh, we\'re in the process of adapting to this new idea" works

That\'s what you think. You MAY even be right (although I don\'t think you
are). But until you present me with some hard figures, I\'m not terribly
impressed with what is, after all, merely an unsupported assumption on
your part.

>If you get at least a few ships a day, it will be reasonable to have drop
>tank service.

Over 50% of worlds in the Traveller Universe has a population of less than
100,000. What makes you think they would be visited by a couple of ships
per day? Moreover, it would have to be a couple of the same model of ship
per day (since there\'s no reason to suppose that drop tanks that fits one
model would fit any other models, not even of the same displacement, and
most certainly not of different tonnages.

Only if there is enough traffic to warrant it.

I\'d be extremely surprised if that price isn\'t dependent on the space tugs
being occupied all the time.

>big tank to store it in.

And a set of drop tanks that fit a Beowulf. Furthermore, the official rules
state that drop tanks are one-use-only. The reason why drop tanks are a
problem at all is that we have decided that it is reasonable to assume that
it would be possible to design drop tanks that can be reused. But that
dosen\'t mean we have to say that they can be _freely_ reused. If we
compromise on a requirement that drop tanks need an overhaul before they
can be reused, we introduce a limiting factor that will increas the cost
of using them considerably. And don\'t bother to say that you consider such
rules hokey. I know you do, and I disagree.

    Alright, the Hivers & the K\'Kree have had a war in the past, correct?
And, the Hivers are master of manipulation, again, correct?  So it might go
down like this:
    1. The Hivers manipulate the 3I & the Solomani into developing a taste
for the K\'Kree, but only for the short term.  As part of their attempt to
"tame" humans
    2. The 3I is attacked by the K\'Kree as soon as they start to eat them.
    3. The SC attacke the K\'Kree to gain some more land.
    4. An agent from the 3I, SC, or K\'Kree finds evidence that they Hivers
started this.and then releases this to the other two sides.
    5. A cease-fire is called & reps meet at a neutral world to discuss this
information
    6. Then the 3I, SC, & K\'Kree put aside their differences & pile on the
Hivers.
    7. The Hivers are majorly hurt by this attack.
    8. It is the end of the Hivers as we know them.

    Correct, but we do know that they are larger than normal, so a scout
would have to be at least 1,000 dt. in size, IMHO.

Needless to say, the Vargr would side with the Imperium in this one.
The Hivers might just sit back and watch, though -- I can\'t see them
getting involved.

Mind you, this K\'kree-as-meat thread did give me an idea for a real
adventure seed: the players investigate (for whatever reason) an 
operation in a human client state between Imperial and K\'kree space,
where really rich decadent types can pay a large sum of money to
feast on K\'kree, even "meeting the meat" before hand. The thing is, 
it\'s a scam -- what they wind up eating is good old-fashioned Terran 
cow, but they *think* they\'re eating K\'kree... meanwhile, the people 
running the scam are making themselves a small fortune, perhaps with a 
percentage going to the K\'kree family who is participating as the 
"dish of the day"... Of course, the players don\'t know it\'s a scam 
beforehand...

They wouldn\'t if you have collapsed them inside the the hull
(or maybe they have a section of the hull on the outside and
just collapse down against the ship.

The thing is that there are a about gazillion ways you could
design them.

you think about all the infrastructure involved).  In the

In Traveller, they have an attitude that every world takes

there isn\'t anything like development funds.

I have friends who do field trips to 3rd world countries for

Well, that the point isn\'t it?  A standard is suppose to make
things clear.  But unless you know if a person is "on board"
for the "standard" then you can\'t really know what they mean
by "TL".  OTOH, GTL and TTL is always clear.

I sort of pictured them being a lot bigger than ship borne
ones (volume wise, I don\'t know how that scales with range).
I woundered if one solution wasn\'t to steadily jump in
components for a similarly large spaced platform and
assemble one (more?) in orbit.  That gets to the question,
how big are the ones on the planet?  How long does it take
to the parts, and assemble, one that is just as big in
orbit?  Why not build one bigger?  If you can build a bigger
one in orbit, why didn\'t they stick a bigger one on the planet?

The answer is probably that the one on the planet is limited
by expense.  If your enemy has invested in a bigger one that
he can bring in (and is willing to invest the time an reasources
to do so) then you have to resort to hiding the location of
yours.  If he doesn\'t have one like that, then he has to do
think like try and take out sensors, try a massed assault, etc.

Well, this is where we "traditionally" disagree.  I do think
that they can be made to work if you make them a brand new
technology and follow through with it.  I just think (and I
suspect that most would to) that it would make it too much
like a B5 setting and having to spend all the material on
the new era on travel would detract from more interesting
things.

The description is that you just had to feed the energy into
the capacitor and then get away.  If that is true, a number of

There is absolutely no reason for that to be true.  The only
standard you would have to worry about is the pipe fitting,
which is not a problem.

Which gets back to the traffic.  Unless you only get a few ships

but it won\'t be for a week or so (big proposal is due).

Well, the drop tanks are explained.  You burn the fuel out
of them and then get away from them.  If that is true, then
you can use the same time to collapse them instead.

Actually, I posted an update to the TML last month during the last \'Cliff\'
feeding frenzy. Again, as I stated in the last update, I\'m now refraining
from setting a firm date, and yes, I am not answering private emails any
longer. That easily eats up 45 minutes or more every day (at least). In
addition to the time consumed, there is nothing new to add to what was
already posted in the last update.

Beyond what I said in that update, I can only add that I am working on the
books intermittently - and this will be the case until my spring/summer
semesters are wrapped up in early July. After that I will have nearly two
months free time (no study or work) and will be making the final push to
finish off the project. 


Cordially,
Paul Sanders

Because the K\'Kree would decide it was necessary to exterminate humaniti if
they found out. Not just the Imperium, but all the other human empires. And
it would be total war, without conventions, making the Vilani look tame.

Would make a good opportunity to eliminate them, though.

There are design rules in the K\'Kree AM by GDW - ISTR that the team working
on the GT version said it will have design rules too.

HG Design sequence - Notes from AM2.
- ----

*Most common configurations for ship hulls are spheres or flattened
spheres. Flattened spheres are the racial preference.

\'Independence Day style\' ;-)

*Turret \'weights\' are doubled to account for remote handling equipment.

Cost remains the same. This is an interesting entry as although the
external turrets are the same size or smaller, the overall volume is
increased to cover the handling. I suggest the module volume and mass be
doubled but area remain the same.

*Crew numbers should be doubled.

Herd mentality. Not as good at handling stress/loneliness as humans

*Quarters are 48dT each with 1MCr per stateroom.
Big increase here. AM2 is kind of vague on this - I read it as each K\'Kree
would want 48dt! This makes K\'Kree ships enormous.

*Double occupancy is possible but requires special skill/training.
The enclosure skill.

*Low berths are not fitted or used by K\'Kree.

Claustrophobia.

The K\'Kree don\'t want to kill off all the other races -- just the ones 
that eat meat.

Still, if the K\'Kree decided to wage a jihad against humaniti, they\'d 
eventually lose. Especially since we could count on the support of the 
Vargr, and possibly the Hivers. (The Hivers would likely not involve 
themselves in a border war, but they would intervene in a war of 
genocide.)

ROTFL

Perfect.  Could you please send me the names for all the ship classes in
all the Sword World navies? :-)

Seriously, as the Sword Worlds language is based on Icelandic, I wanted to
have some "authentic" names for ship classes, for an upcoming expansion to
101 Starships. Any mistakes you make can be attributed to linguistic drift,
so you can\'t escape now! :-)

FWIW, as soon as someone sends me GTL9 versions of the standard GT ship
modules I\'ll start designing the ships. If you wait for me to design the
modules myself it will take a lot longer, as Far Trader finally reached
Toronto yesterday.  (And, with impeccable timing, it did so just before
marks are due, forcing me to exercise self-control rather than diving in
immediately.)

What sorts of names are you looking for? One possibility is to use place
names (which you can get off a decent atlas). Another is to use personal
names. An excellent source for building blocks is a book called "The Old
Norse Name", by Geirr Bassi Haraldsson. Contact me privately for details.

The surgery they did on her to turn her from a sociopathic sadistic murderess

Actually, much of this has to do with the recording of western history more
than any thing else...there _have_ been successful, largely matriarchal
societies in the past, the Cretans for example. But history as it has been
primarily taught in the west has largely glossed that over. In a large number
of cultures, wealth and prestige has passed down the matriarchal side of the family.

Pointing to the inner city as an example of a matriachy is flawed at best,
disingenuous at worst. This \'society\' is largely the construct, in the US at
least, of a combination of absurdly flawed (and eminently _pat_riarchal)
welfare laws requiring the _absence_ of an adult male in the household,
economic disintegration of the inner city caused by flight to the suburbs,
coupled with an extraordinarily high rate of adult male incarceration, thanks,
in the past few decades to a war on drugs, which though illegal have provided
one of the few economic opportunities in these areas.

ObTrav:

	Given the discussion that lead up to this, regarding \'failed\' societies...how
prevalent IYTU\'s are things like Utopian experiments such as the Amana colony,
or The Great Leap Forward, or the War on Poverty, either gone right or gone
horribly wrong? Basically a bunch of like minded people get up and go found a
colony on their own world, staying true to their own beliefs.

These are staples of SF literature, particularly in many of the clear literary
ancestors of Traveller, but most of the adventures and campaigns I\'ve read
mention such places only in passing.

Anyone make more extensive use of such? Examples we can stea^h^h^h study ;-)

But the Director\'s cut only came out around \'93 IIRC, which is around 10
years after the first print had achieved a \'cult\' status.

Me to. It went on limited release in the UK and I saw it on the big screen
in Southampton, then later on on a smaller screen in my University. The
detail and impact of it was amazing compared to the 4:3 ratio on the
version I previously had. Sadly, the first time I saw it I was mentally
repeating the voiceover...

I agree. The film seems to be stressing that once the replicant\'s have
memories there is nothing to differentiate them from humans. Indeed, in
Rachel\'s case, there is nothing to distinguish her as a replicant until she
goes rogue and the Tyrell Corp reports her missing.

Being honest, I feel sorry for Batty, although horrified by his brutality.
But that is just an effect of the way he was made; the monster that
destroys Tyrell is created by him.

The other clue is the corporations motto \' More human than human\'.

Wrong, Scott added the narration. He wanted the studio to kill the picture
since they messed up the unicorn sequence and others.  He figured that the
voice over would make it unappealing, but the studio execs love it and Scott
was VERY unhappy.  His plan backfired on him.

Batty inspired many folks. Ann Rice has often said that Batty was a model
for the Vampire Lestat.

	There is very little real reason to believe that the Cretans were 
matriarchal.  There is  not enough evidence to support that assumption, since 
their indigenous language remains unreadable, and their later Linear B 
wrintings in Greek show a typical Greek patriarchy.   While it is possible 
they were matriarchal, there\'s no real evidence to support it.

The K\'Kree don\'t want to kill off all the other races -- just the ones

    Also this might bring the Zhos, the Sols, the Imps, & the Vargr into one

they are all from Earth.  And, while they may fight amoungst themselves they
are family, in a way.  And, no one messes with family.

My take on blades is slightly different, though quite similar. I don\'t have
any "powered" bladed weapons, but they are definately high tech,
constructed by advanced methods with advanced materials. A TL13 Broadsword
in MTU, for example (in MT-based rules), has a Pen 11 and Dam 4, which is
better than a number of firearms! However, one must face one\'s enemy for
the attack. Even a TL13 Foil has a Pen 6 and Dam 2. I found that most
players prefer firearms, with good reason, really, but a good blade comes
in very handy, especially on high law level worlds. When the players began
employing these weapons in conjunction with their firearms, it made for
some dramatic scenes and swashbuckling excitement!

as an example of DT\'s that need overhauling think of the Shuttle

as to Trav DT\'s, they would need checking for cracks after each drop,

All I can say in Paul\'s defense is that he delivered the first \'pirates\'

	It immediately absorbs all the kinetic energy from the air molecules

As I said earlier, this was a rumoured detection method from the press.
It may or may not work - personally, I can\'t see detection of water hump
as tenable except under shallow water conditions. However, there are
plenty of other methods available to detect a sub in the far future.
Densiometer and Neutrino scans? What about the magnetic signature? TL8
MAD (Magnetic anomaly detection) isn\'t good enough to be used for
searching; but what of the future? A good study in of the (open)
literature should show a number of technologies that would be good for
detecting subs.

If you use thrusters to hover, you\'ll be noisy - unless you\'ve come up
with a way of moving water through pipes and then into water flowing a
different direction without making noise.

Depth doesn\'t seem to be a problem to meson weapons.

Well, any speed will make *some* noise. Above the background in a quiet
environment? hard to say. About 50kts is the rule of thumb limit for
hydrodynamic drag on a modern hull form, unless you are using some
insanely powerful drive (like, say, thrusters ;).

Actually, thrusters would be good news - reactionless, so no noise from
the end drive; and no rotating machinery to vibrate the hull.

The costs presented in GURPS Traveller hold for hulls at other tech levels.
Lower tech hulls mass more than high tech hulls: multiply the GTL12 mass by
the multiplier on the following table.

Armour gets more effective as tech level increases. Calculate armour as

For those interested, the most recent figures on the Australian Bureau of

in 1997 was 18,532,200.

The line I heard from a tourist promo made for the US market was: "A

Actually, I *think* it\'s more like "the population of _Manhattan Island_,

Anyone know the current population of New York City?

I suspect that the task turned out to be a couple orders of
magnitude harder than Paul thought, too.  And, of course, real life
probably *is* intervening.  ;->

Yes, Paul is later in delivery than he anticipated, but when hasn\'t
that been the case in publishing.  I\'m just as anxious for Marc to
get T5 finished and published.  

In both cases, however, it\'s better for them, and for us, for them
to take their time and get the jobs done right.  Right?

Interesting - I hadn\'t considered this idea before. This may be a
justification of the plethora of highly specialised skills in games such as
GURPS and Rolemaster.

Further to Bruce\'s economist post, here\'s one vaguely remembered from an
old BC cartoon:

Ant Son: "Dad, what are economists?"
Ant Father: "Son, economists are a bunch of mathematical wizards, schooled
in the monetary science of a particular country, who, when the government
starts to go down the monetary pipe, band together and... _disagree_ with
one another".

;-)

[with apologies to Jim, Carlos, and Eris, and... - well, it seems that
everyone here is an economist  ;-)  ]

Jim said:

It also seems appropriate for the level of a _game_, as well. Oh, I can
understand Carlos being upset about simplifications that are applied in an
area he knows something about - just as most of us would roll our eyes when
someone on TV hacks into Cheyenne Mountain with chewing gum, a beeper and a
phone line... (oh, and I forgot the gaffer tape... ;-)

At some point, the authors of ANY of the Trav books have to make a decision
to stop at a particular level of abstraction, simply in order to get
something ready for publication NOW (and not next year). Our only concern
should be that they actually have enough time to do things at least
reasonably properly - that is, checked against reality & existing Trav
canon, playtested properly, spellchecked/proofread, and run past Marc or
Loren. Otherwise you have some of IG\'s problems, again. I still laugh at
the - unnecessary - transporter in "Missions of State", and the FTL commo
in JTAS 26...

What I would suggest is that Jim and the other authors get together and
publish a Pyramid article dealing with drop tanks and their effect on G:T,
specifically (remembering that Ian\'s design is FF&Sv2, not GURPS).

Ok, design us some.  :-)  Then design us a jump drive that they\'ll work with.

I said a long while back (as this thread goes <g>) that they\'re only 
"dooming" to a certain model of jump drive (one that is far from being 
established by canon).  This completely ignores the economic issue.  ;-)

I rather like the idea that the "Meson" isn\'t an actual meson but some kind 
of particle that will be discovered in the future.  I saw this in 
rec.games.frp.gurps:

I explained this one early on for my games.  My second Traveller group
was composed almost entirely of physicists, engineers, and so on.  We
were playing the Traveller adventure, where the principle of the Meson
gun is a major exhibit in a museum the players visit.  Of course, one
of the players says "Say, neophyte physics major, how do these things
work, anyway?"

I trotted out the usual explanation.  I had always chalked it up to
Traveller Magic, and let it go, but this group wanted a better 
explanation.

Me: "Meson guns fire a beam that detonates inside a target, ignoring
armor.  Accelerators use time dilation to time the decay for maximum
damage.  they can be screened against."

Them:  "But mesons do interact with matter!  And the things that do
not, such as neutrinos do not decay."

Me: "These Meson particles have two states.  One state interpentrates
normal matter without interaction a la Hogan\'s Genesis Machine.  The
other state decays into the usual shower of secondary radiation in
femtoseconds.  The state transition happens a precise time after
generation.

Them: "I have not heard of _any_ particle like that."

(GM thinks fast...)

Me:"You are in a museum with a whole display dedicated to them.  There
is a section on the history and discovery of them."

Them: "We check it out."

Me: "You notice that the Meson particle is always capitalized where
mentioned, unlike the usual protons, electrons, and so forth..."

Them: "Who came up with these things?"

Me:"A Solomani named Robert T. Meson.  Brilliant inventor, but totally
untrained in particle physics.  It is an accident of history that when
he discovered a particle which decayed after an exact time, in its own
local frame of reference, he named it after himself."

Them: "And nobody else noticed the existence of the original meson?"

Me: "Bob Meson proposed his death ray weapon to the Solomani Navy at a
time when they were in a war with the Vilani.  The admiral that heard
his pitch was well aware that small m mesons would be utterly useless
for a weapon, and thought that this would distract the enemy spies,
and perhaps cause all sorts of research to go the wrong way."

Them:  "So why is it still called a Meson gun, 1100 years after an
1800 year dark age 300 years after they were discovered by someone
a hundred parsecs away."

Me: "Tradition."

Them:  "No - what is the real reason?"

Me: "The R. T. Meson noncharitable trust still owns the copyrights on
non military uses, which he licenced to virtually every megacorp.
Even though he has long since died, the megacorporations of the
Imperium cannot fundementally alter the sales terms until his heirs
are either found or proven dead."

Them:  "We claim to be the Hiers to the Meson Fortune!"

Lets not forget the Gazelle Close Escort.  It was designed to require drop
tanks to get its jump 5, when dropped.  Until they were replaced it had
fuel only for a jump 2.  If the tanks were retained, it has a jump 4
capability due to the extra volume.

It does use the fuel right from the drop tanks to power the jump drive.
The Gazelle was designed in CT or HG and had an internal 81 ton fuel tank
with 100 ton drop tanks.  When making a jump 5 (dropping the tanks) it
required 150 tons of fuel.  When retaining the tanks and making a jump 4 it
used 160 tons of fuel.

Pot, Kettle?  Give some objective analysis that doesn\'t "support" your 
preconceived conclusions and you might even sway me.  I don\'t think you have 
anything but strawmen up your sleeves, though I would be glad to see 
otherwise.  You have some assumptions that COULD actually be valid (if the 
economics rules were altered, though), but you\'ve given nothing beyond your 
opinion to support it.

I want some *evidence* for your conclusions on drop tanks.  Your opinion is 
just not enough for me.  We\'ve seen several economic analysis of them that 
conflict with your preconceived notions.  This is, for some reason, tying 
your panties in a knot.  Simply give some evidence rather than opinion.  Or 
can you admit you don\'t have any?  That you just don\'t want drop tanks to 
work and you\'ll go to any length to rationalize it?

I\'ve seen nothing to indicate your argument is anything but hooey.  I\'ve been 
open minded about this from the beginning, never having used drop tanks, nor 
teh gazelle.  It seems like you haven\'t either, and are unwilling to even 
give them fair consideration.  Now I frankly don\'t care, but at least admit 
on what you\'re doing, if that\'s it.

Yes, you\'ve pointed out the proper parallel that I was desperately
trying to avoid, mainly because I wanted to bolt the scenario
onto the Gurps:Traveller universe.

(Strephon LIVES!  Strephon LIVES! Strephon... umm, 
please excuse that uncontrolled outburst of enthusiasm there.)

Regardless, it would be interesting to roleplay the Civil War 
era, and the political debates whirling around at that time.
Especially if the Referee makes it clear that it doesn\'t have
to turn out in the same way as the Offical Timeline....

>I\'m also more inclined to think of the Zhos as the Persians. Vargr as
>Germans fits though.

(I tip my virtual hat) Yep, that would fit better.  The main issue here
is having the Imperiun degrade, without having the Solomani
launch the Second Solomani Rim War.  The Zhodani aren\'t so bad,
but you\'d have to make sure that they don\'t economically expand
into the Marches and rake the place of the Imperial economy.
The Vargr, of course, merely add to the fun.

Imperial Varient: Dust and Ashes

Actually, I always wondered why the Solomani didn\'t retake
all their lost territiories during the Rebellion era: it seem\'s
mainly due to internal divisions and poor ground forces
(Remember that weak "grav tank" the Confederation Army
was using against Trepida\'s? As the French said in a 
similar situation, "It\'s magnificent, but it is not war.").  Moreover
the Imperial Vilani and Vegan\'s, knowing what was coming if
they lost, fought with a desperate valour, successfully stopping
the Solomani from conquering the Vegan Autonomous Region
with Federation of Daibei help (Daibei being another breakaway
piece of the Imperium, refusing to give Lucan the sector fleet\'s).

If I remember the "Children of Earth" web stuff properly,
a armistice was nearly complete at the time of the Virus
release of 1130.  Which brings up an intersting question:
what if there was no Virus?

The immediate political effect is the continuation of interstellar
civilization in Known Space, with much of the Imperium slipping
into another Long Night.  Dulinor\'s fleet\'s would have successfully
destroyed Lucan\'s main Rimward force at Cymbelline (without
Virus infecting his computers), and probably made a successful drive
to Capital, killing Lucan.  Even so, none of the other fractions would
recognize him as Emperor, so he would return to Illeish, to deal 
with the Verge rebellion against his rule.  He would retain a garrison 
at Core sector, to put some muscle to his claim as Emperor and deny
other\'s the right to that title.

With the end of the Second Solomani Rim War/the Rimward theater
of the Rebellion, a somewhat larger yet less belliose Solomani
Confederation would become the dominant power in it\'s area.
With the effective self-destruction of it\'s old enemy, attention would
turn inwards to reform, the softening of Solomani ideology,
reintergrating Terra as the capital of the Confederation, and putting
the ecomomy on a peacetime footing.  The Solomani/Aslan/Daibei/
Vegan peace is a peace of mutual exhaustion, and has a good chance 
of enduring.

The Domain of Deneb would probably become the Regency as in TNE.
The democratic element\'s of The New Era\'s Regency alway\'s felt
artifical to me: I\'d retain noble rule, but agree with the ending of the
Psionic Suppression\'s.  The Vargr occupying Corridor would stay, but
become Client States of the Regency.  Trade with the Ziru Sirkka
(Revived Vilani Star Empire) in Vland Sector would be dangerous, but 
doeable.  Eventually, Vland independence would be recognized, and the
Regency would shift into the Star Empire of Deneb, with good relations
with the Zho\'s and the Vilani.

The Julian Protectorate would incorporate Antares and 
The Empty Quarter.  The rest of the Coreward Imperium would become
Vargr and Human mini-states.  Dulinor\'s garrison at Sylea would 
eventually rebel, becoming the Second Sylean Federation and renouncing
any claim to the Third Imperium.  Strephon\'s Imperum would have long 
disintergrated into the Wilds, just like the rest of the interior sectors.
Margaret\'s Holding would become the Domain of Delphi, with Margaret\'s
line claiming to be the sole legitimate descentant of Strephon\'s dynasty
and the Third Imperium.

That was my take. But Maybe we can recruit some more.

RC ASSEMBLY HALL, AUBAINE (0738/AUBAINE, A78A884-C), 15/II/1203
KEYWORDS: TRADE BILL, TRADE ROUTE, SO SKIRE SUBSECTOR, SITAH, BACK FACE

	A bill has just been introduced that would fund and authorize contact 
and diplomacy missions into So Skire Subsector that would facilitate official 
relations with the Reformation Coalition and facilitate official Reformation 
Coalition endorsement of the Hive Federation\'s recently established J3 trade 
route connecting the Reformation Coalition with the Sitah (Subsector P/Old 
Expanses) region.
	Initial commentary has been very muted, but it is expected that 
Oriflammen representatives will oppose the measure, as they have a number of 
operations ongoing in the "Back Face" of the Coalition, that could be 
endangered by official Coalition activity.  Other Centrist and 
Pro-Consolidation representatives are expected to favor the measure, and 
Federalist sentiments are divided.  Many Aubani representatives wish to see 
the Oriflammen "conquest" of the Back Face thwarted, but are dubious in 
encouraging the increasing power of the Coalition\'s central government, 
particularly in issues of interstellar trade.
	Other debate has circulated around revising the Primary Area of 
Operations to allow full operations in this and other subsectors, but the 
issue is expected to be blocked by both Centrist and Federalist leadership, 
who are protecting the compromise agreed upon with the founding of the 
Coalition.

True, but the version seen most often now is the Director\'s Cut, which was
my point (for whatever reason, I forget now).

The impact was fantastic. The effects still hold up extremely well even 17
years later. I never understood the voiceover. I understood what was being
said, but I didn\'t understand its use in the movie. The very size and
appearance of Los Angeles was integral to the plot and served very well as
"narration."

Exactly. The reps were human in all but name.

Batty is a really sympathetic character. He\'s a man who (through no fault of
his own) is completely out of time. I think alot of props go to Rutger
Hauer. His portrayal was fantastic. He ad-libbed the ending monologue...

"I\'ve seen things you people wouldn\'t believe. Attack ships on fire off the
shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser
gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to
die."

Which is an amazing feat and is just such an downright amazing line. Of
course, I think I read too much into it.

>The other clue is the corporations motto \' More human than human\'.


Not to mention the whole scene in Tyrell\'s room. The impression that I got
from "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" seemed to be more about identity.
I read it a long time ago, so I may not be remembering it correctly. It
seemed to have a different focus. Then again, identity is a recurring theme
with Dick.

Do you have some reference on this? The story has always been that the
studio demanded the voiceovers after a negative reaction from the general
public at a test screening. That one goes back a long time. I think I first
read it in Starlog.

There\'s a Los Angeles Times article that is quoted in the Blade Runner FAQ.
If you could reference it, I\'m sure the FAQ maintainer would love to add
that in.

Dulinor "wins" w/o Virus.  He got to within 3 or 4 jumps of Capital (at least

I think it would be more Dulinor controlling Lucan\'s safe and his own, w/ his 
efforts being to secure teh region connecting them (and turn away the K\'kree, 
which shouldn\'t be *too* difficult IMO).  Seems like most of the people in 
Lucan\'s zone would be glad to have him gone, though Dulinor would have alot 
of propaganda to overcome.  Probably giving ground (even a treaty, perhaps) 
to the Solomani (and collectively scrunching, though not eliminating, 
Margaret).  Norris and Vland stay independant, though possibly Vland returns 
to the Fold.  Antares either stays independant or stays in the Julian 
Protectorate.  IMO.  I see a defense pact of some kind amongst the other 
factions.  The whole point of MT, IMO, was to destroy the single Imperium and 
make many.  It\'s teh same result in the New Era.

I don\'t see that, at all.  Rebellion Sourcebook speaks of Norris having to 
face his choice between Empire Of Deneb or Federation of Deneb.  I can\'t 
really see Norris choosing anything but the "Federation" (Regency) model.  
YMMV (and apparently it does).  ;-)

But remember, it\'s the Real Strephon in Gushemege.  He keeps it and joins up 
in a defense pact w/ the Regency, Vland, and Antares.  Support of the 
Lancians and Gushemege.  Maybe in a sort of defense pact against Dulinor w/ 
the other factions.  Maybe even recognizing Strephon as Suzerain, though not 
as absolute autocrat, as all those factions are leaded by Archdukes who\'ve 
sworn fealty to Strephon, though recognize the need to serve their own people.

Interesting thought excercise, though I prefer the "real" sequence.  :-)

Sorry, but *lots* of misconceptions here. Scott certainly never wanted the
studio to "kill the picture" (why would he want that?). Sure, he was
disappointed that they wouldn\'t let him shoot the unicorn dream, but he
didn\'t let that stop him from making the best film he could. (The unicorn,
BTW, never appeared in the original "workprint" preview showings; the
unicorn in the anniversary "Director\'s Cut" release is actually test
footage from _Legend_ -- and not very good, either).

Voice-overs were present even in Hampton Fancher\'s original script, and
were included in every version of the screenplay up until just months
before shooting began. From the very beginning, Ridley Scott and Fancher
wanted a voice-over narration because it was a staple of the film-noir
detective genre -- and because Scott loved the atmospheric voice-overs in
_Taxi Driver_ and _Apocalypse Now_. But eventually they were written out of
the script as unnecessary and distracting.

However, the test audiences reacted with confusion when the work-print was
shown, causing the producers *and* Scott much anxiety about the film\'s
commercial chances. Scott concurred with his producers that a more upbeat
ending, and explanatory voice-overs, should be added. So he hired a
novelist to write voice-overs for the otherwise-finished film.
Unfortunately, the producers thought his work was too artsty-fartsy, and
hired a bad TV writer (uncredited) to do them yet again.

Finally, an already-exhausted Harrison Ford was brought in, to record the
voice-overs -- and for a single, final shot (smiling Deckard and Rachel
driving away in a sunlit car). Ford deeply loathed Ridley Scott, but I
don\'t believe he intentionally did a bad job on the voice-overs (as some
have suggested) in the hopes that they wouldn\'t be used (he thought they
were stupid). I think he was simply tired, and not the right kind of actor;
he does good "physical acting", but his line-reading skills are sometimes
deficient (he\'s no Deniro or Martin Sheen, that\'s for sure).

An amusing aside: at the world premier of BR, each of the two
screenwriters, Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, thought the *other* had
written the voice overs. Having become friends, they did their best to
pretend they liked the voice-overs, so as not to offend. Only later did
they find out that some nameless hack had done them!

Anyone with an interest in BR, or in film-making in general, really should
read Paul Sammon\'s terrific book, _Future Noir: The Making of Blade
Runner_.  It\'s the most authoritative source on the film, obsessively
detailed, stuffed with obscure lore, and just a great read.

Despite its flaws,_Blade Runner_ is still my personal favourite film, and
(after Kubrick\'s _2001_) the second-greatest SF movie ever made.

holomovie mills?

(4) Wonderland misjump! You end up really far away! Mayb not in the universe

we\'ll see this appear on the Pyramid web site (Loren, any thoughts on that?).

- --Jack Chalker\'s Well World. (One solo book, on large book split in half, two

Great stuff, that Paranoia Press, IMHO.

Anybody know details of the "Serpent Worlds" campaign? When the "Cobra Class" 
(?) scout was first mentioned waaayyy back in JTAS#2, it mentioned that it 
was part of Don Rapp\'s "Serpent Worlds" campaign. This ship made a 
reappearance (with some variant ships) in S&A, as a product of the "Delta 
Research" line.

I\'d love to hear more about this early campaign, heck, I\'d love to hear some 
"tales out of school" from Marc or Loren about their campaigns!

While tripping down memory lane, I took a quick look at my Traveller 
collection. Damn! I**don\'t** have "Aliens and Artifacts" any more! Got S&A, 
M&M, Beyond, Vanguard Reaches, SORAG and I might even have some of the 
standard papers they sold...but no "Aliens and Artifacts". 

Anybody out there have a copy they would be willing to part with?

No, however women were allowed much greater freedom than in contemporary
Rome.  Boudicca was not representative, and in fact, "took over" only after
her husband died, similar to Queen Zenobia of Palmyra (modern Syria).

There is a significant difference between matriarchal lineage (practiced by
a quite large portion of the planet) and matriarchal rule, which are
virtually non-existant.  The problem is, in primitive societies, might make
right, and among humans, male=might, pretty much.  By the time technology
comes along to help out, society is usually set in its ways.

We\'ve seen an *opinion* by Chris Thrash that under GT rules Drop Tanks had
only a 15% cost advantage. Yup, only 15%, in an Imperium with interest
rates in low single figures.

I posted a design (the \'Mongerel Dog\' class) on 10/4/99 that put the cost
of a jump-6 using drop tanks at Cr 1110 plus (0.78 * drop tankage cost).
The design was brutally un-optimised, using a TL9 fusion power plant, and
assumes a need for a 5% annual rate of return on capital.

Gary, I\'ve done the work. They do to Imperial trade and society what
railroads did to trade and society on Earth. For a start, you get mass
tourism and such - a 1 dton bunk puts a jump-6 return trip at about 2
months pay for many Imperial citizens.

And if you assume the vaguely efficient capital markets of the late 3rd
Imperium, they do it in years rather than decades.

Gary, I\'d be more than interested to see you throw some numbers about in
support of your position.

The Zhodani dont *want* to expand. They dont want to absorb all those
Imperials, for a start. All they want is to make it clear that Imperial
expansion must be frozen at or about the border established by the initial
Frontier Wars.

Quantity has a quality all of it\'s own, to quote Stalin. With seven intact

Y\'know, a lot of people thought Stalin would soften after WW2 was over too.
They were wrong (although I guess you could regard Khruschev as that

I dislike the Regency supplement - it is the *most* Yanks-in-Space of
anything I\'ve read.

Also, you can stack the shit out of their \'democratic assembley\' so easily
it isnt funny (1 vote per UPP pop point ... six 200 people colonies, and
you out-vote Mora. Get real ... it\'d turn into an orgy of branch-stacking,
corruption and stresses as the big worlds retaliate after being outvoted on
issue after issue ... with the big worlds are providing the tax base,
remember. If you are goanna have one vote per planet, make it a House of
Review with limited powers. Plus the alleged starship shortage plus a
billion Zho refugees - how\'d they get to the Imperium ? Rowboats ?).

I actually think the Second Civil War sans virus would have been about as
destructive as, say, the Hundred Years War plus the Wars of Religion were
in France, or the Peasants Revolt plus the Thirty Years War in Germany.
Lots of damage, lots of tragedies, but enough infrastructure left to rebuild.

You really only need TL7 plus a handful of TL11 worlds to keep a viable
interstellar society going. You can do a lot with a dozen Type S scouts
dedicated to hauling spare parts.

I\'d actually like to revisit Hard Times, from the POV of a Free Company
type group - a Cruiser Squadron who have declared independance. One 20 kton
battlecruiser can suppress a lot of pirates, and the two subsectors in Hard
Times (I\'ve forgotten them - I had to give Hard Times back to it\'s owner)
had a good base from which to rebuild, once security was established
(repeat after me ... *convoy*).

That is why you need three shots fired from a given messon site.  Try it
graphically.  With only the vector known the third shot locks in the postion
provided the target are reasonly spaced apart in 3Ds.  If distance can also
be aproximated (it should be doable) two shots are a lock.

Think about it for a moment.  Those meson are moving at near C.  They have
momentum.  That momentum must be consevered.  Also even a very short half
life is a HALF life.  So if the half life in in the fraction of one
millisecond you will have a disperion pattern of the energy created by the
decay.  That pattern will be your arrow pointing to the source.

As for and atact on a ship the ships screens should be designed to provide
the vector for an incoming attack.  If not then the ships senors should be
able to record the interation between the ship\'s screens and the meson beam
and provide the vector.

This may hvae already been done, as I am still catching up on my TML

Skyron fits the new solar system model, I present the following data, 
taken from Andrew M-V\'s First Contact data, which in turn came from 
Supplement 10: Solomani Rim, retrofitted to the 2096AD timeline:

Skyron       0533 X312000-0    Ic Ba              002 Us K5 V M8 D

Unfortunately, Skyron has two stars and only two gas giants.  Close 
fit, but not quite what we\'re looking for.  Still, once I\'m caught 
up, I\'ll give it a try and see what I can find, too, just in case.

Before teh surgery she wanted everybody very dead.  Mr. Jim DiGriz was the
only one who was her match.  She was a mad genius.  She still is but now she
only wants Jim\'s enemies dead... and female that looks in his direction for
to long...she still very blood thirsty.

Her insanity came from being born very smart but very unpretty.  She had a
night mare child hood that left her very bent!  IIRC.  The information is
only in about 4 paragraphs in the book she first appears in.  I think it was
either the second or third book.  She made and spent a fortune to make
herself very beutifull and pretended to be much less smart than she was.
She kept an old picture of herself and asked Jim after they first slept
together if he would have slept with the girl in the picture.  Then she
tries to kill him and turn a \'supper weapon\' ship loose on the universe.
She wanted to \'make them pay\'.

Scientists grow arteries in the lab
Technique may one day be used in heart-bypass surgery

MSNBC NEWS SERVICES

April 15 - An experiment with pig cells and a machine that
mimics the pulse of the heart shows that new, living arteries
can be grown in the laboratory. The finding could one day
make heart-bypass surgery possible for patients whose own
vessels are too diseased to be used in the procedure.

...A number of labs are now experimenting with tissue culture
techniques designed to grow new body parts. Some have grown
ligaments, tendons, bone and even a new ear.

Robo-fish spawn new technologies


HIROSHIMA, Japan, April 12 -  It looks like a real sea bream,
and even swims like one. But try to make sushi and you\'ll
end up with a mouthful of silicone. Scientists at Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries who are trying to build nimbler ships and
submarines by developing oscillating fins have come up
with a lifelike robot fish.

THE SCALY MACHINE is also the first step in lead researcher
Yuuzi Terada\'s dream of building a Jurassic Park filled with
convincing replicas of long-extinct water creatures.

"We thought, let\'s make something really unusual," said
Terada.

The aquatic robots, developed over four years at a cost of up to
$1 million, are programmed by a computer and guided by clusters of
sensors in a special tank.

The 23-inch sea bream weighs nearly 6 pounds, the same as a
real fish of that size. A primitive version made its debut at a 1997
show in Indonesia. Mitsubushi has since built an improved version
that was first shown in Japan at the end of last year.

...Mitsubishi\'s scientists aren\'t the only ones working in the
relatively new field of underwater biomimetics: Researchers at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, have
developed artificial pike and tuna. Northeastern University,
meanwhile, is working on robotic lobsters and eels that may be
used by the U.S. military to look for underwater mines.


ObTrav:  While wilderness-refueling in an ocean just outside
an Imperial Naval base, one of the PCs decides to snag some
of the local sealife for dinner. An attempt to clean the
catch results in the discovery of the critter being a
surveillance device of a design never seen before...

I certainly don\'t dispute that drop tanks will change the face of the
Imperium eventually. All I\'m saying is that I don\'t think that it would
necessarily happen so fast and be so widespread that modules like _The
Traveller Adventure_ would be invalidated.

And, yes, so far this is just as much unsupported speculation as any
opinions to the contrary. I do intend to work out some examples to
back up my opinions, but right at the moment I have higher priorities. 

And, just to twist Chris\' tail a bit, let me point out that if the _Far
Trader_ rules turns out to "prove" that drop tanks doesn\'t exist, then
it is incompatible with G:T, because G:T _does_ mention drop tanks. So
strictly speaking that would make the FT rules flawed ;-).

Canonical returns for starships are slightly higher (5.something).

And you\'re ignoring the effect of an existing fleet of conventional ships.
Say someone sets up a drop tank route and undercuts the previous line. It
goes bankrupt. Its ships are sold for a fraction of their original value.
The new owners have radically lower operating costs (since about 55% of
operating costs are bank payments). Now they can outperform the drop tank
ships.

Is that necessarily a bad thing? How many canonical world writeups claim
that the world\'s main income is from tourism? Quite a few IIRC. With
conventional ticket prices these writeups are  --  unlikely, at least.
With reduced prices, they become more plausible.

I\'m moving into murky waters here, but I\'ve always felt that the whole
atmosphere of the Traveller universe adventures and other writeups imply
a much greater amount of travel than the official ticket prices warrants.
YMMV.

Whereever drop tanks are cost-effective, yes. But will drop tanks be cost
effective for low-traffic systems? That\'s what hasen\'t been established.

Hrm..I\'ll have to look at disposable weapons again.  I don\'t recall them giving
anywhere _near_ this level of advantage over a standard weapon (you might want
to check your math).  However, as a non-single-shot weapon, you can get this
level of damage (with much better range) for only 360 lb...

Btw, this weapon doesn\'t fire DU -- that would be an armor divisor of 3.  Armor

Heh.  "Suppressing half the population not only removes them from
productive

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The fastest-growing part of the American (and developed-world) economy
is the Service sector. The people who clean our clothes, cook our
meals,
care for our children, run our errands, etc.

These tasks have always needed to be done. They were simply done
by people who weren\'t counted in measurements of the economy -
housewives. 

As more and more families saw the "free" housekeeper/nanny/cook
turn into another working parent, the value of this person to the
household has started to become apparent. Especially when the 
replacement value of this person is reflected in a massive increase
in the service economy.

(I\'m not indicating that people are hiring out and out live-in
servants,
but every time a family orders a pizza or drops a kid off at day-care
we see a service that cost nothing (because the housewife did it for
"free") 
changed to a service that money is paid for and the economists can
see.)

ObTrav: a society that creates invisible housekeepers out of half the
population is probably the simplest hidden factor a interplanetary
economist has to deal with.

Kharganian Merchant: "Why should I pay good credits for a washing
machine? My husbands keep the laundry done just fine, and cost me
nothing but food - and I have to feed them anyway, at least until
after breeding season. Make their workload easier? Do you realize how
stupid they\'ll make me look if I start pampering them?"

I remember reading a column in the late 70s or early 80s which tried to
calculate the cost to replace a "housewife" (could be either gender

and family) and the results were pretty big.  Consider that a housewife
does duties covered by (incomplete listing):  cleaning, childcare,
nursing, psychologist, banking (allowances and their application to
minors), laundry, tutor, sex partner (there is some cost for this unless
one is celibate), judge/lawyer/arbitrator (which one depending on the
childcare model in use), and some others I can\'t think of at the
moment.
The column I read calculated these functions (at professional hourly

	There\'s nothing in FT that could possibly be used to "prove" drop 
tanks don\'t exist.  FT is based on economic principles and the GT vehicle 
design rules.  We didn\'t make up any of our prices out of thin air, they are 
all based on costs spelled out in GURPS rules on vehicle design and crew 
pay.
	The only way to establish whether or not drop tanks are economically 
viable in GT is to do some designs.  What I did was to compare the 3,000dton 
J-4 Tukera Freighter in FT before and after drop tanks.  Assuming 35 trips 
per year, 2 standard lighters for man-handling drop tanks, 1 ship per-day 
in-system, and fully re-usable drop tanks with a week of inexpensive 
refurbishing, I found a 44% drop in per-dton, per-parsec cargo costs.  
	The difference between these figures and Chris\'s early ones are, I 
think, jump number.  Chris worked things out for J-2, which is what most 
freight travels by.  I did J-4 because I figured that drop tanks would be 
used first along x-boat routes.  Based on the frequency of ship traffic I 
worked out when doing FT, I don\'t think drop tanks will find much use off 
Main or Feeder routes.  Note that disposable drop tanks are a non-starter in 
GT because fuel tanks are so hugely expensive under GT rules.
	Will drop tanks revolutionize interstellar trade in GT?  Not really.  
GT fuel tanks cost too much to keep a lot of them lying around so it will 
really be up to the lines to make use of them.  The lines are likely to 
convert to drop tanks along all their Main and some Feeder routes. It won\'t 
be cost effective to keep tanks around for the unpredictable tramp merchant 
traffic.  Once drop tanks are fully implemented they would be worth a +.5 
BTN on any J-4+ route they served.  Lower jump numbers don\'t get a big 
enough boost to show up on the course BTN scale.
	Will drop tanks revolutionize interstellar trade in "regular" 
Traveller?  This I can\'t answer because I haven\'t done the analysis.  
However, I\'d like to point out that under FF&S2, jump drives are much less 
expensive and thrusters and powerplants are much more expensive.  This means 
that a space-tug big enough to capture and haul discarded drop tanks for a 
given ship class is going to be a significant fraction of the cost of that 
ship class.

	Particularly for the big shipping lines that have financed their ships 
out of retained earnings, this effect will be a powerful detterant to 
immediate adoption of drop tanks.  Since the lines are not held to a fixed 
value for their ships through the bank mortgage, they can just depreciate 
conventional designs and compete with the drop tank ships until the 
conventional designs wear out.  This will still be a huge financial blow to 
the shipping lines, but they won\'t have to go through bankruptcy to lower 
the asset value of their ships and make them price competitive.  This makes 
it likely that drop tank routes will only be added slowly as existing 
capacity is retired.  Doing otherwise raises the spectre of over-capacity 
and trade war, as discussed under that heading in Ch2 of Far Trader.

	As you well know Hans, the ticket and freight prices in Traveller have 
been too high for a long time.  Even without drop tanks they can be brought 
way down.

Actually, I did some analysis and came up with maybe a 25% advantage over
existing Jump-4 designs -- you may have missed that post.  The problem is,
that is still only half the difference between express (Jump-4+) and
conventional freight rates. Since most of the costs in a drop tank
operation (tug rental, etc.) are relatively fixed, this advantage will be
correspondingly smaller at lower jump numbers.

Rather than spend time and energy debating why drop tanks *can\'t* work the
way they\'re supposed to, why not figure out how they *can*? At least in GT,
drop tanks will be considerably more expensive than in CT/HG (>Cr80,000 per
dton, even with the "Cheap" option). Also, am I not correct that all these
analyses (including mine) hinge on drop tanks being reuseable? Perhaps this
is one source of difficulty. 

Marc Miller has said ("Jumpspace", JTAS#24) that jumpspace is inimicable to
all matter -- anything entering jumpspace is destroyed -- and that LH2 is
necessary for the formation of the jump bubble that protects the ship.
Further, he has said (T5 draft) that any object larger than the ship itself
disrupts jumpspace just as a planet does. Two additional elements are
required: infer that the timing of a drop tank operation is very close (a
matter of seconds, rather than minutes), and ignore for now such exotica as
the /Annic Nova/ and jump projectors (Clark\'s Third Law, if nothing else). 

The system looks like this: drop tanks provide LH2 to the jump drives right
up to the moment of jump -- what it is used for is another debate. They are
then jettisoned out of the developing jump bubble and destroyed in
jumpspace. Since there is no interval between using the LH2 and entering
jumpspace, a "jump station" larger than the ship would interfere with entry
into a stable jump (and might risk destruction as well), while one smaller
than the ship is simply a more expensive form of drop tank (and would be
destroyed). 

We are left with a system that is expensive (cost of replacing drop tanks
after every use) and potentially unreliable (incomplete separation of drop
tanks -- ask any fighter pilot). There may be applications, military and
civilian, where these factors are offset by operational necessity or a
profitable niche market, but they will be highly specialized -- as canon
suggests. This description is self-consistent and fits the facts so far as
I know them; why not move on to something more productive? We could even
debate what those operational necessities and niche markets might be.

All this is based on reasoning rather than analysis, of course. I\'ll get
back to the list with revised cost figures, based on drop tanks being
expended in use, and then we can see whether this is indeed an answer.

Heck, no -- I would never say that something attested in CT/GT canon
doesn\'t exist (though I might not focus on it, either); I leave that to
Marc Miller or Steve Jackson. Drop tanks are just a solution to a problem
anyway, same as farpoint stations. The [in-context] issues are what
problem(s) do they solve, what does it cost, and are there better ways to
do it?

The out-of-context issues are what effect *should* they have on trade (or,
more precisely, what effect do we *want* them to have), and how do we
justify that result within GT?

	IIRC (If I Recall Correctly), CT uses 13.5 cubic

	1.5 x 3 x 3 m, or two 1.5 x 1.5 m squares on a floor
	plan which assumes 3 m to a level (a 0.75 m thick
	floor with gravetics, wires, hoses, vents, etc. and
	2.25 m from floor to ceiling). If you prefer feet 
	to meters: 1.5 m = 5\', 3 m = 10\', 0.75 m = 2.5\', 
	2.25 m = 7.5\' (approximately). Tonnage can be 
	played with a little: my staterooms are only four
	1.5 x 1.5 m squares, the rest is halls, lounge, air 
	lock, etc. About half of engineering tonnage can be 
	accessways, controls, spares, etc. Some of bridge 
	goes to seats and controls, some to sensors and 
	electronics, and some to halls, ship\'s locker, etc.
	My cargo bays are usually 4.5 m high (3.75 m floor 
	to ceiling). All said and done, if a design comes
	in within 5-10% of the right tonnage, that\'s cool
	with me.

Lets not forget the Gazelle Close Escort.  It was designed to require
drop
tanks to get its jump 5, when dropped.  Until they were replaced it
had
fuel only for a jump 2.  If the tanks were retained, it has a jump 4
capability due to the extra volume.

It does use the fuel right from the drop tanks to power the jump
drive.
The Gazelle was designed in CT or HG and had an internal 81 ton fuel
tank
with 100 ton drop tanks.  When making a jump 5 (dropping the tanks) it
required 150 tons of fuel.  When retaining the tanks and making a jump
4 it
used 160 tons of fuel.


Jimmy Simpson
>>>> (end quoted material)
Lets remember that in the Real World (tm) the Gazelle was designed
using a beta version of the High Guard rules, and so it doesn\'t conform
to the "normal" rules we keep trying to pin on it.  After all, it has 4
turrets on a 300 dton hull with 100 tons of drop tanks.  If you try to
bring it into strict compliance with HG, you either need to say the rule
of 1 turret per 100 tons is flexible, or those aren\'t _exactly_ drop
tanks.  For the sake of the current argument (and because I think it is
more correct), I will choose the latter option.  This is especially easy
since supposedly drop tanks are a TL15 technology, but the Gazelle is
TL14 manufacture.
Here is my take on the Gazelle\'s tankage:

The Gazelle was a test bed design, intended for patrol and anti-piracy
sweeps.  It was decided to test out the feasibility of drop tanks, which
were the new thing niggling at the edges of military thinking.  Because
the technology wasn\'t fully developed yet, there were some oddities of
this design.  The drop tanks are actually designed as regular fuel
tankage that happened to be located and plumbed in such a way that they
could be explosively detatched if needed.  Because they were normally
retained, and were considered part of the normal hull, they have part of
the radiators, Lanthanum grids, and other hull mounted items normally
part of a ship\'s hull.  Thus, if the drop tanks were dropped, the ship
would tend to overheat during battle situations because of the extra
heat load from an extra turret full of energy weapons.  These external
drop tanks also proved excessively vulnerable to enemy 
fire.  The sharply reduced Jump capability of a Gazelle which lost it\'s
drop tanks made it unsuitable to it\'s intended purpose, and there were
never more than a few thousand of this model made (a few thousand is
still a small number when there are more than eleven thousand member
worlds and lots more client states that need to see the flag fairly
often).  This early model of the Gazelle class tended to destroyed in
battle or have major accidents significantly more often than
conventional vessels and set back the drop tank program by quite a
number of years.  A later model was produced with only three turretts,
which allowed continued full functionality even with the drop tanks
dropped.  However, the reduced firepower in the retained configuration
made this a less desirable option and only a few hundred of these were
produced.  A major variant renamed the Fiery class made the tanks
integral rather than droppable, and radically modified the hull to make
it streamlined.  The fiery class was the most successful of the three
and functioned adequately in it\'s designed role (though still rather
poorly in straight battles).

Thoughts and/or flames are appropriate at this point.

I refer you to the schemes that I and 2 or 3 other people have,
already posted on how you might have  collapable tank.  If anyone
actually posts objects to them, I will get into issues like
the fact you can can have cells that empty and start collapsing
before the whole tank is collapsed.

In the meantime, you aren\'t realy in a postion to offer a
challenge.

the bank to get some cash, it was percolating through what\'s left
of my mind, and teamed up with some arcane constructions that can
be used to justify some things that would _seem_ to be against
Traveller canon.  This was the result...

Canonically, the Imperium doesn\'t allow polities to join, only
worlds.  However, it\'s equally canon that associations - customs
unions and postal unions, for example - between member planets
can be formed; the only outright prohibition would appear to be
tarriff/commerce unions.  Additionally, the Imperium does not
interfere with the internal governance of a world, and there are
records that show that a member planet may own another member
planet.  Thus, the prohibition on polities seems to mean only
that the Imperium won\'t recognize them as such.

The interesting factoid is that if the Grimaldis can\'t produce an
heir to the Monaco throne, the principality reverts to being part
of France.

CARLSMONT CITY, 110-1105 - Grand Prince Isharii, Prince Royal of
the Principality of Carlsmont, has been seriously injured in an
air-raft accident while returning from a ski holiday in the
northern mountains.  He is undergoing surgery at ...

Grand Princess Eloise was also injured in the accident, though
apparently not seriously.  She is remaining by her husband\'s side
during this ordeal.  Doctors are maintaining a close watch on
her, to ensure that her unborn child, the heir to the
Principality throne, is healthy. ...

The young couple, celebrating their second anniversary, had taken
this holiday as their last opportunity to enjoy their favorite
recreation before Her Highness was to be prohibited by her
pregnancy from engaging in overly strenuous physical activity.
...



CARLSMONT CITY, 111-1105 - A weary-appearing Dr. Theoden
Kamehameha-Galishakaa reported that Grand Prince Isharii\'s
condition has been stabilized, although His Highness is in a
coma.  His condition has been upgraded from Critical II to
Critical I, and he is on full life-support in the Critical Care
Unit at the hospital.  The medical team assigned to His Highness
are reporting that they have every hope that he will make a
recovery, but caution that His Highness\'s injuries are quite
severe. ...



CARLSMONT CITY, 113-1105 - Doctors for Grand Princess Eloise have
announced that Her Highness will not be able to give interviews
in the immediate future.  Her personal physician, rushed to the
hospital on short notice late last night, refused to do more than
say that she is in no danger, although weak from the stress of
recent events. ...



NewsNet Special Alert

CARLSMONT CITY, 115-1105 - Although no official word has come
from doctors or the Royal Household, NewsNet has learned that
Grand Princess Eloise miscarried two days ago.  Although
distraught, Her Highness is apparently healthy. ...

Doctors remain optimistic about Grand Prince Isharii\'s prospects,
although he is still deep in a coma.  His Highness is progressing
well, and there is every likelihood that he will improve enough
to be removed from full life-support within the next few weeks.
...



NewsNet Special Alert

CARLSMONT CITY, 118-1105 - Unofficial reports from sources at the
hospital indicate that Grand Princess Eloise was rushed into
surgery early this morning.  One hour later, hospital
administrators banned the press from the premises, and the Royal
Guard assisted in the expulsion. ...

Reports from the Diplomatic Quarter and from Government watchers
seem to indicate that both the State and Foreign Ministries have
cancelled all appointments, and called in all personnel who are
on leave. ...



CARLSMONT CITY, 119-1105 - Duke Shaamika, the Ambassador to
Carlsmont from the Kingdom of Seetay-Lumyere, was abruptly
summoned to the Ministry of State this afternoon.  He emerged a
short time later, but refused to answer any questions concerning
his summons. ...



CARLSMONT CITY, 121-1105 - A spokesman for the Ministry of State
today officially announced today that Grand Princess Eloise had
indeed miscarried eight days ago, when she stopped giving
interviews.  He professed no knowledge of any subsequent surgery,
although he stated that the doctors had Her Highness under close
observation. ...



CARLSMONT CITY, 123-1105 - The Ministry of State announced that
His Highness, Grand Prince Isharii, had been moved out of the
Critical Care Unit and into the Intensive Care Unit, although his
condition has not as yet been officially upgraded from Critical
I.  Grand Princess Eloise is reported to be in good condition,
though she continues under observation.  The Ministry spokesman
again denied any knowledge of surgery subsequent to Her
Highness\'s miscarriage. ...



CARLSMONT CITY, 124-1105 - Although no statement has come from
the Ministry of Defense or from the Seetay-Lumyere Embassy,
observers have reported to NewsNet that the Carlsmont Detachment
of the Seetay-Lumyere Combined Arms appears to have recalled all
personnel from leave. ...



NewsNet Special Report - 125-1105

Although Carlsmont and Seetay-Lumyere have had a close
relationship these past three centuries, few people realize just
how close - and how fragile - that relationship is.  NewsNet\'s
Historical Research Section has obtained a copy of the Charter
granted by the King of Seetay-Lumyere to the first Grand Prince
of Carlsmont, and direct ancestor of Grand Prince Isharii,
Lavrenti Artekata.  The charter specifies that if the Artekatas
cannot produce a male heir to the throne of Carlsmont, the grant
shall be revoked, and Carlsmont shall revert to being a province
of the Kingdom of Seetay-Lumyere. ...



CARLSMONT CITY, 127-1105 - The Ministry of State announced today
that Grand Prince Isharii has been removed from full
life-support, although he still requires assistance to breath.
He has not regained consciousness as yet, though his doctors
remain guardedly optimistic.  Grand Princess Eloise remains in
good condition under observation; the Ministry expressed hope
that she will be willing to give at least a short interview in
the near future. ...

. . . . . . . . .

At any time after the report of 119-1105, the PCs may be
approached by someone representing either Seetay-Lumyere or the
Carlsmont Ministry of State.  The contact should be a close
personal friend of one of the PCs, and both the contact and the
PC should have a history of trusting the other to be discreet
when necessary.  The contact emphasizes that this is certainly
necessary this time, to the extent that all of the other times
are public announcements in comparison.  He then hands the PCs a
packet containing a photograph and other information, and briefs
the players as follows:

"His Highness is in worse condition than has been made public;
his doctors generally agree that it is unlikely that he will
regain consciousness.  This would not have been a problem had Her
Highness not miscarried, as an heir to the throne would have been
assured - in-vitro fertilization was used to assure that her
child would be male.  Normally, even the miscarriage would not be
a problem, as we could repeat the procedure to produce an heir.
However, Her Highness was indeed rushed into surgery on 118;
internal injuries sustained in the accident made it necessary to
perform a hysterectomy upon her.  Thus, we have no way of
producing another heir descended from His Highness.

"However, a re-reading of the Charter, and a consultation with
the Ambassador from Seetay-Lumyere, has given us an
interpretation of the Charter that we can use to preserve the
independence of Carlsmont.  Discretion in this is necessary
solely because of the need to avoid panic; while most
Carlsmontites would have no objection to Carlsmont becoming part
of the Kingdom of Seetay-Lumyere, there _is_ a small nationalist
movement that would resort to terrorism to prevent it, if
possible.  The Ambassador from Seetay-Lumyere has agreed to
assist us in maintaining our independence, and has messaged his
King accordingly.  The local defense forces were put on a
low-level alert against the possibility of terrorism were we to
be forced to announce the full state of affairs with no heir to
step in.

"The information you have been given in this packet will
hopefully be enough for you to find the Grand Prince\'s exiled
brother, Ramduur, and secretly bring him back here to take over
as Grand Prince.  His Highness would have brought Ramduur back
after his mother\'s death last year, but the Privy Secretary, who
had served His Highness\'s parents until His Late Highness\'s
death, and supported Ramduur\'s banishment, advised against it.
The Secretary is fully aware of the current situation, and agrees
that Ramduur must be brought back, although he has expressed
distaste for the man.

"You are not the only ones attempting to find Ramduur.  We have
agents on most planets in the area; orders have already gone out.
Wear these collar pins at all times; they will identify you to
the other agents, who will be wearing similar pins. They will
help you to the best of their ability; you must help them to the
best of yours.  Nobody who is not wearing one of these pins must
know of your mission; not even Ramduur, when and if you find him.

"Obviously, speed is of the essence; while we don\'t know how long
we can keep the subterfuge up, there will be a point beyond which
people will be suspicious, and from there, things will degrade.
If you can manage to find Ramduur, we can present him right up to
the moment that Seetay-Lumyere accepts that we cannot produce an
heir; after that, it won\'t matter.

"The packet actually contains information on several cadet
branches of the Artekata family; if Ramduur turns out to be dead
without male issue, any of the individuals listed as eligible may
be brought back instead.  The individuals are marked in order of
preference, but if you find one who\'s not at the top of the list,
don\'t waste time - bring him in.  I\'d say to do that even if
you\'re not sure about Ramduur, but there are political nuances
that I\'m not prepared to go into right now.  Go for Ramduur, and
grab one of the others only if Ramduur is an impossibility.

"I can guarantee you a payment of Cr100,000 from the Ministry of
State\'s discretionary budget if any heir is presented, whether
you\'re the one that brought him back or not.  If no heir is
brought back, there won\'t be a Carlsmont to pay you.  Further
payment would necessarily be at the Grand Prince\'s discretion.

"I wish I could do more for you on this, but I\'m definitely
bending - hell, breaking outright - the rules as it is - and
quite frankly, the only reason I\'m sure I won\'t be shot for
treason for telling you the situation is because only His
Highness can pronounce the death sentence.  The agents off-world
won\'t question you, with the pins, though, so once you\'re out of
here we\'re both safe.  Good luck!"

*Notes to the Referee

This is obviously suitable as a background for other adventures,
and it can develop in any direction that the referee wants.
Further developments in the news are at the referee\'s discretion;
remember jump lag in dating them if they go off-world at all.

Ramduur was exiled by the current Grand Prince\'s father because
of a sex scandal.  It will be trivial for the PCs to learn this.
By now, most Carlsmontites have forgotten the scandal, or would
brush it off as a minor indiscretion, so if Ramduur can be found,
he will readily be accepted as the new Grand Prince, if the
populace of Carlsmont know that the Grand Prince is unlikely to
recover, or as Regent if they don\'t.  Seetay-Lumyere will accept
him, as well.  Other heirs will not gain such easy acceptance;
Seetay-Lumyere will insist on verifying the lineage, and the
populace won\'t trust the heir or the Government.  If this comes
to pass, there will be an upsurge in nationalist feeling, and
growing unrest that can only be assuaged after the people have
seen that the new Grand Prince is fair and friendly, like the
old, and in control of the Government, not under the Government\'s
thumb.

While he has not been prominent, Ramduur has made no effort to
hide his identity, and it should be easy to pick up his \'trail\'.
However, he joined the Imperial Navy about seven years ago, and
at last report was a Lieutenant in a squadron that has seen
action and taken casualties recently. It is up to the referee\'s
discretion whether Ramduur - who is/was serving under his own
name - is dead, alive, or somewhere in between.  Several of the
other individuals are quite suitable as heirs, being business,
government, or military leaders; others may be adequate, being
followers rather than leaders; a number of them are absolutely
unsuitable (but may be the only ones available), being \'dropouts\'
of one type or another (convicted criminals, substance abusers,
etc.) or incapable of even understanding the situation (mentally
retarded or victims of brain damage/injuries, etc.).  Physical
handicaps are no problem (and several of the cadet candidates
have them), provided that either (a) they already have male issue
to be their heir, or (b) they are capable of siring children so
that they can have an heir after ascending the throne.

At the referee\'s discretion, an added twist can be that Ramduur
is Isharii\'s _twin_ brother, which opens up the possibility that
Carlsmont can use him to make the Grand Prince have a "miraculous
recovery".  If Ramduur _is_ a twin, the players will not be told
this, although if any of the PCs knows what the Grand Prince
looks like (referee\'s discretion), it will be evident from the
(old) photograph that there is a _strong_ family resemblance.  In
order for this to work, Seetay-Lumyere must be kept from knowing
that Ramduur has been found.  In that event, it is entirely
possible that the Government of Carlsmont will feel it necessary
to take actions to ensure that the PCs do not blow the plot.

In generating further events on Carlsmont, remember that crises
like this seem to have a flurry of activity at the beginning,
when the situation is first developing, then they settle down to
a stable state, where everyone is waiting for a change, and then
either they degrade slowly when it is apparent that things
_aren\'t_ going to change, but those in charge aren\'t willing to
acknowledge it, or they rapidly come to a head, when something
serious happens, possibly (though not necessarily) making it
clear that the truth had not been told earlier.  The Carlsmont
government will try to keep the lid on as long as possible, but
the longer they do so, the more complex the lies have to get, and
the more pressure from Seetay-Lumyere will be brought to bear.

Gary, you have thrown generalities, strawmen, etc at me all along,
and tried to accuse me of the doing the so at the same time.  I
asked to stick to the subject and you contiued.  I stopped resonding
to your post (giving you the last word) and you were the one who jumped
into something I posted in response to Hans with more genralities.

I have responded to arguements with arguements.  I have posted
more analysis and secifics than you have.  I am also willing
to rest on what I have posted with others without having to
"claim victory" in a revisionist way.  Before I was just not
responding to most of what you post.  I guess I will just
have to stop reading you posts too.

The claustrophobia and herd mentally can be fooled to
some degree by a high quality VR rig.  The view from
the inside would be a wide open cockpit populated by
other K\'Kree AIs that represent weapons, navigation,
and engineering.  Thus, the pilot is surrounded by
a virtual crew of technically proficient K\'Kree that
mimic all the automated functions and displays within
a normal fighter.

  T\'kor\'s labored breathing and foaming blood spoke
  volumes.  Navigation was down for the count.  He

  was the fourth crewman nodded from it\'s acceleration
  couch.  "Fully charged."

Snip of excellent adventure idea.

The one fly in the ointment here is the known Imperial practice of
freezing ova and sperm for later need, particularly for higher ranking
nobles.

Thus it would be a relatively simple matter to produce an heir, using a
surrogate to bring the heir to term.

More to the point, since it is the _Prince\'s_ line that needs
continuation, and presumably extracting the sperm is a viable procedure,
the Princess need not enter into the picture at all, only a surrogate
mother.

Now these plot complications can be dealt with by simply invoking a
clause in the agreement that the legal heir must be the natural
offspring of the prince and his lawfully constituted spouse.

1) Her frozen ova could have gone missing. An enterprising young tech at
the Royal cryogenics facility could have heard about this and
immediately realized the value of that little canister currently
residing in liguid nitrogen. She has stolen it and is planning on
extorting the Royal Family. 

Two game possibilites here:

The royal family has contacted the PC\'s to _discreetly_ find her and
recover the ova, either by force or negotiation.

_She_ contacts the PC\'s to act as go-betweens...

2) As above, but agents of Seetay-Lumyere have stolen the frozen ova.

The PC\'s are sent to find them and recover the ova, or failing that,
expose them for their crime.

3) As above, but the tech is secretly a member of that small nationalist
movement. They know full well the details of the original agreement, and
are forcing the dynastic and independence crisis to move the populace to
their side.

The PC\'s are recruited to infiltrate the group, and recover the ova.

As the saying goes...

    ...much hilarity ensues...;->

No, I modified the same ship you did, Jim, for the same reasons. The
discrepency is probably due to different assumptions. In particular, I used
a tug instead of lighters, on the theory (stated explicitly in Supp 7:
Traders and Gunboats) that drop tanks can only be "replaced" at a starport
or base, and so either have to be picked up as cargo (takes time) or tugged
back to port. Tugs are more expensive, etc., etc.

This just serves to illustrate how squirrelly pronouncements about what
*would* or *would not* happen with drop tanks really are. That word
"replaced", for example -- does it mean, "reattached"? or "buy a new one"?
Big difference.

This is an interesting idea, but I don\'t see it happening.
From what I\'ve read of the K\'Kree, they are one of the most
conservative and intolerant races in known space.

To them, it is inconcievable that a K\'Kree would willingly
strap himself into a little box all alone. It doesn\'t matter that they
can use high-tech to pretend otherwise, they\'ll still know they\'re
doing something un-K\'Kree. The pilot will know, the designer will
know, the government of the 2000 worlds will know - and none of
them would even consider such an idea.

It\'s not like they normally have small fightercraft, and had some pilots
who couldn\'t use them without help - none of the K\'Kree is suited to
be a fighter pilot, unless they suffer from abberations like "no discomfort
in close quarters" or "likes to be alone". I don\'t think a K\'Kree with those
abberencies would survive long, btw.

Using technology to overcome a phobia is something that is done
when the phobia is abnormal and most members of society don\'t have
it. To a K\'Kree, claustrophobia and unwillingness to be alone aren\'t
abnormal - their spaceflight and space combat solutions will include
lots of room and lots of crew in the same way our ship designs include
heat and atmosphere.

I\'d say that the K\'Kree will fill the fightercraft niche with drones.

Gateway Sector. It is the year 1119 since the foundation of the
Imperium. 
The imperial influence is all but no existent. While the Imperium
considers this sector as a buffer-zone, an other danger threatens this
sector. In 1106 a superior battlefleet of the Xuruk Emipre, a K\'Kree
splinter-state, attacked and overwhelmed the inferior defence-fleet at
Xabthar. .....

<being to tired to translate the rest :-)>


For the rest, Jens wants to play a PBEM based on Lords of thunder in a
3d-version of the Gateway-Sector using (mostly) MT. He is searching for
players.

One of the conditions of playing is not having read MegaTraveller
Journal 4 (which is bad for me), another one is Jens intent to do the
whole thing in german (which might be not so good for some other
people).

You won\'t see any complaints from me on this!  The one thing I really liked
about FFS1/2 was the ability to build custom weapons, specifically the
Meson and PAWs.  If there would be a way to simulate the multiple
accelerators in MT, I for one would love to hear it.  

OTOH, the best part of the ship construction rules, IMO, from MT was that
it started to scale certain technologies for the higher tech levels.  At
TL-17 the J-Fuel required per parsec begins to drop.  The engines have
reached the best range possible (short of some canon changes ;-) ), so now
they get more efficient.  I also liked the optimized packs that could be
acquired.  

YMMV

However, the K\'Kree have a number of subject races as part of the 2000
Suns; it\'s only carnivores they have a big thing about. They certainly
would use these subject races in the appropriate situations. It might
take \'em a thousand years to do so, but once they do decide, that\'s what
all the K\'Kree battleships will use for pilots.

well being Jewish; I hope you\'re right, but the numbers don\'t jibe (a billion 
Christians and Muslims vs. 18 million Jews). At Least the non-religious ones 
will be absorbed, though the Orthodox might keep their identities.

Ob Trav: maybe Mel Brooks was right: "Jews in Space!" (from History of the

First off, matrilineal is not the same thing as matriarchal.  Matrilineal
cultures can still be patriarchal.

Second, I\'d wonder about Judaism being absorbed. I can see some fusion with
other religions (with these mixtures probably considered heresy by _both_
parent religions). I suspect that the customs of even the most extreme
Ultra-Orthadox sect will drift (look at all the changes that have happened
in the last 2000 years). But then, I\'d expect _any_ religion to drift.

True, but remember that not all of these functions are being performed to
professional standards, so using professional rates of pay is an
inappropriate comparison.

Ah, I see my mistake. Regular access space is equal to the PP volume. Long

Thought I had. Insignificant effect

Revised design:

VOLUME
PP: 400 cf
Access space: 800 cf
Airlock: 300 cf
Docking tube: 40 cf
Fire suppression: 2 cf
Total: 1542 (just 42 cf over 3 dtons - what else can we add, or can we call
it 3 dtons?)

MASS
Base mass of PP: 20000 lb
Airlock: 3000 lb
Docking tube: 2000 lb
Fire suppression: 200 lb
Total: 25200 lb (12.51 stons)

COST
Base cost of PP: 4 MCr
Cost of \'fusion core\': 1 MCr
Airlock: 0.006 MCr
Docking tube: 0.003 MCr
Fire suppression: 0.005 MCr
Total: 5.014 MCr (5.01 MCr)

How\'s this?


>This isn\'t a bad start. I await to see more lower tech modules on the TML.
>(save me the trouble of doing them m\'self! <G>)

Well, if someone could do the weapon modules I\'d appreciate it. Doug maybe?

So we still need:

stateroom
bunkroom
low berth
passenger couch
fuel tank
jump drive
maneuver thruster
bridge
cockpit/systems (seems to include reactor core, as small craft don\'t need one)
utility module
turret
bay
missile rack
laser
sandcaster
fuel processor

This would be a lot easier if we knew what went into each regular module in
the first place. If someone could post a breakdown that would help.

Because it is exposed to a vacuum or zero pressure.  At that point it would
snap from solid to gas instantly.

Now somebody brought up the cracking water for hydrogen idea a while back.
Basically, liquid hydrogen is 1/14 kg/l.  Water is 16 parts oxygen and 2 parts
Hydrogen.  Water weighs 1kg/l.  Thus water contains 1/9 kg of hydrogen/liter or
about 55% more hydrogen by volume. As an added benefit, you don\'t have to keep
water at cryogenic temps.

Extending this further (and somebody will have to check the density for me)
Methane (CH4) is 2/9ths hydrogen by mass. (14 parts carbon 4 parts hydrogen).
Methane liquifies at -161K at 1 ATM (I think) so cryogenics would still be
required.  The question then becomes what\'s the density of liquid methane?

If cracking methane for hydrogen proves volumetrically economic, then I could
easily see the military using it for double jumps and forking over the extra
credits for high test fuel.  If you\'re into HEPlaR tech, I\'d imagine that the
higher density carbon or oxygen atoms would give you a better thrust ratio,
although you may have to knock all the diamonds off your exhaust manifold
repeatedly.

Um...no.  Simple low pressure won\'t cause frozen hydrogen to turn to gas --
that takes energy.

Unfortunately, it doesn\'t take very much energy;)  Your hydrogen rock won\'t
last very long if its exposed to sunlight.  However, some careful work with a
sunshade and very careful vehicle design might allow solid hydrogen fuel.

Heh.  Liquid methane has a comparable increase in density, with a lower weight
penalty.  I\'d probably require that you have a pure hydrogen tank for actually
jumping, however (the higher density chemical storage might be reasonable for
storing fuel for a second jump).

It strikes me that streamlined ships, at least, should be restricted in how

Yes, for visiting the next world over. But visiting the next subsector over
is still quite expensive. Drop liners will have the greatest effect on long
distance jump traffic prices.

Other than that, Jim and Chris describes things exactly the way I imagine
drop tanks work in the Traveller Univers anno 1120.

Dude do you mean "Here" like in the astral plane or like El Cerrito or
what?  Like after the last time I was abducted by like Droyne, I started
totally channelling this pre-spaceflight Vargr mystic named Vroughgren,
and it like changed my life, and I mean totally, dude.  So you can often
find me meditating on Indian Rock because you can like see the place in
Marin where a Droyne ship crashed 10,000 years ago.  So maybe you\'ll
like think that I\'m not all Here, you know, but all of me is, dude.

No, a Vargr wouldn\'t find a K\'kree spooky, because Vargr aren\'t like
humans.  Would a dog find an intelligent fruit spooky? or how about an
intelligent mouse? or an intelligent deer?  No, of course it wouldn\'t. 
It would find the fruit uninteresting like any fruit, the mouse an
enjoyable snack requiring quickness and skill, and the deer a major meal
requiring teamwork and an aggressive attitude.  I guess what I\'m saying
is that, at that instinctual level where emotions like "feeling spooky"
reside, Vargr are more like dogs than humans.  

(That\'s in my Traveller universe, of course, but I think it\'s consistent
with what\'s been published about the Vargr.  I should also note in that
light that Vargr notions of ethics and morality are at least as varied
as those understood by humans.  Thus while most Vargr don\'t think twice
about killing some small animal and eating it, some Vargr are
vegetarians who won\'t eat anything that is able to know that it is
alive.  Indeed, some Vargr give a prayer of thanks whenever they eat
anything, because they recognize that just about anything they eat,
whether plant or animal or one-celled organism, was alive and the
process of keeping that Vargr alive involves killing that plant or
animal or one-celled organism.  (Off-topic, I think that\'s what is
really meant by the funereal phrase, "in the midst of life, we are in
death".))

The K\'Kree and Hivers wouldn\'t stand for it being in the open market,
and would likely go to war with the Imperium over it.  It would have to
be deniable (by the Imperial Ministry of State).

I tend to agree.  Moreover, the Vargr sense of smell is much more highly
developed that that of humans (though less than the K\'kree\'s), so
they\'re likely to judge food well in advance of putting it into their
mouths.

You would DEFINITELY want a separate jump tank.  I\'d even have a waste tank for
the carbon buildup.  Anyway, does anybody know the density of liquid methane so we
gearheads can work up the specs?

Yes but is that actually in the rules?  I know it specifically forbids

No, that was the ship from CT Supp 7: Traders and Gunboats, and it states
that it can make a jump 2 without the tanks.

In the original JTAS 4 article, you are correct, it could not jump without
the tanks, but with them it did J-4, without (dumping them), J-6.

Well, my research (which could be wrong) puts liquid Methane at about 420 kg/kL.
That\'s about a 30% increase in hydrogen density which makes water the better
alternative.

    'body' => 'Dear Folks -

I enjoyed Joseph\'s take on the Gazelle. It conforms to canon, makes sense,
and creates an in-game explanation for a problem caused by clashing rules
sets.

Those of you (Chris, Jim?) who are going to "run the numbers" on drop tanks
may like to consider the cost of salvage. Now, I know Jim is going to
assume non-reusable drop tanks, but it would be worth a look to see if
reusable drop tanks have the effect that David and Ian suggest.

My vision of reusable drop tanks was straight out of Asimov\'s "The Martian
Way"; that is, you have a bunch of spacers that snag the dropped tanks and
cart them back to the starport for a salvage fee. Now, even if you change
this and say that large lines have their own salvagers (or contract them),
this is going to cost you! Here are some reasons:
     - the scavengers/salvagers must live long-term on spaceships out at
the 100-diameter limit (salaries, inconvenience bonuses, consumables, fuel,
hire fees);
     - they have to pay for fuel BOTH WAYS from the starport to
100-diameters and back again;
     - unless your freighters jump from a dead stop, the scavengers must
expend more time and fuel (i.e. money) matching vectors with and snagging
the tanks;
     - if you use jump masking in your campaign, the optimum jump point
will change, and the scavengers must expend time and fuel (i.e. money) to
keep up.

I\'m sure there\'s more, but that\'s all I can think of off the top of my
head.

In any case, you may like to run the numbers, and then give them to Marc
and Loren so they can decide whether drop tanks are reusable or not. This
would then become canon.

Good luck!

The lion has again proved itself the king of beasts 
after a ferocious two-week battle in the Ethiopian desert. 

Reports from Addis Ababa say a pride of lions killed 35 
hyenas and drove off the rest for the loss of six of their own. 

Ethiopian television showed sand billowing as a lion 
wrestled with six hyenas, with other lions watching. 

Police said the rocky area in south-eastern Ethiopia 
was now firmly under the lions\' control. 

...snip...

Wildlife experts said that in any sustained conflict the 
smaller hyenas were always likely to incur more losses - 
despite possessing jaws which could crunch their way 
through elephant bones. 

The two sides had been fighting for territory in Gobele 
desert, close to the district of Girawa, 450km east of 
Addis Ababa. 

Prevailing drought conditions probably played a part in 
igniting the war. 

Fierce battles raged every night. During the day the animals 
took cover in their dens, waiting for the sun to set. 

...snip....

****************************

An interesting  "nugget" to throw into a larger adventure,
in my opinion.  If the PC\'s are contracted to help bring out
the latest issue of Imperial Xenographic (with it\'s famous
red bordered media), the animal\'s and their environment
would definitely need fleshing out.  This becomes even more
true if this is a Scout adventure, with the PC\'s studing
the local biome.

While I personally favour Scout adventures the most,
they are rather difficult to design.  Unlike mercenary,
merchant, and political adventures, field research 
require a lot of unfamiliar background work (at least for those 
of us who are not scientifically trained).  Especially for
those without any experience living in a rural environment, 
it\'s just plain hard to fake it well in a gaming session.

I suspect this is because there isn\'t many movies based 
on research in the wild, in comparison to military or political 
adventures. Many of us can draw on our real-life work 
experience to flesh out merchant adventures, though not with the
care and depth that G:T Far Trader provides.  (An unusual 
number on this list can use real-life experiences to help model 
military adventures: I suspect that this is not typical of roleplayer\'s.
Of course, it\'s an unquestioned fact that the average Traveller 
player can out-think, out-fight and out-work any ten D&D
players, for an example....)

What "science movies" there is tend to have an undisiplined
approach to science, to say the least.  The focus is on the 
violence and sheer weirdness: while this has its place, it 
would be pleasant if the PC\'s could learn new, unusual 
and interesting things in their adventure as well, preferably 
interrelated to each other in an elegant and coherent fashion.

{Why yes, I want God to be my Traveller Referee.  Why do you ask?}

Often, for the PC\'s to gain the knowledge the
Referee must have it in mind to teach the PC\'s in the first place: 
this means more background work.  

There are also rather limited ways that animals can threatened
even a lightly-armed man.  We dominated the Earth with just 
sticks and stones, never mind meson cannon or orbiting starships.
The best way to threaten the PC\'s is with unexpected natural 
surprises, but you are unlikely to catch them more than two or 
three times before they learn to ask questions and do some 
research before going into the wilds.  Still, very thinly known 
and/or uninhabited regions of a planet would provide players 
with a real challenge, but requires a lot of intensive
background work by the Referee.

It will be interesting to see how the new Scout\'s book agrees/ 
challanges my thoughts: if past experience is a guide, it should be
a joy to read and greatly expand what Traveller Referee\'s can do with
Scout\'s.  It will be interesting to see how it stack\'s up against
the legendary World Builder\'s Handbook form DGP.

[Aside: apparently, WBH obtained an internet award for "most useless
single page" in ANY Roleplaying Game.  It\'s the page where a Scout\'s
vest is described.  In detail.  With weight and cost, by tech level.  
And a typically elegant DGP illustration thoughtfully added.]

I thought hydrogen would only "freeze" at 0K - which is unreachable. It is
too small (1 proton, 1 neutron) to collapse into a solid, and at temps of
1-4K it is some sort of super fluid (with named states like hydrogen III,
or something).

Uh, it\'s been a long time since I learned any of this - could one of our
resident physicists correct me?

IIRC whales, dolphins, sharks, et al have some sort of active adaptive
streamlining that
lets them move through water at much greater speeds than would otherwise be the
case (New Scientist 1997?). I don\'t think 40 knots is a problem.

Hey that\'s an excellent idea to put a small power plant on whales & dolphins to
give a false neutrino reading - It\'s probably required for the breeding program
anyway :^)

A fully stealthed sub would optimally have a signature similar to aquatic life.

6000 lb / 50 = 120 cf for the drive

This holds for all tech levels. As GTL11 fusion power plants are the same
as GTL12 fusion power plants, a GTL11 jump module is the same as a GTL12
jump module (except that the maximum possible jump is less).


Calculating a TL9 fusion power plant:

Assuming that I\'m correct, GTL9 starships will be very big and clunky, with
huge crews.  Is this why the Terrans won?

The Book of Leviticus provides:

11:2   Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the
        beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the
        earth.

 11:3   Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth
        the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

Because the K\'Kree are sentient, they aren\'t "beasts" and so can\'t be
eaten at all.  

If they are considered beasts, however, we can ask the questions of
11:3:  are they cloven-hoofed and do they chew the cud?  I don\'t
remember, and don\'t have anything on the K\'Kree handy.

I recently designed a new, improved, 125-ton Scout/Courier vessel for
the GURPS Traveller campaign I am about to start running. Using the
GT rules, a 125-ton ship has 125 "spaces" if it\'s not streamlined, 100
if it is -- streamlined ships have 80% of the capacity of an unsteamlined
one. Each component (drives, fuel tank capacity, etc.) uses up one "space".
Doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations (which, unfortunately, I can\'t
seem to recall), each "space" worked out to be a floor area of 6 square
metres. (The grid I used for the deck plans, I used one-metre squares, and
each "area" worked out to six squares.) This is assuming a 2.5-metre ceiling
height (about eight feet) and the normal stuff between decks (plating, 
wiring, conduits, and whatever else they have under there).

You can substitute "yards" for "metres" without too much error, if you
like.

One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember (and I don\'t remember if it was
mentioned in another post): Standard GURPS Space measures ship tonnage
as one ton = the volume displaced by one ton of water. Traveller (and
GURPS Traveller) uses one ton = the volume displaced by one ton of
liquid hydrogen, a much larger volume! So if you\'re looking at any
GURPS Space material, make sure you take this into account.

Not wanting to be difficult, but...
According to canon, the world Fenris (Solomani Rim 1830) is the star 
Procyon. And according to the maps, the Fenris system has no gas giants. 
If they were to detect a gas giant around Procyon in the near future, 
what would we do?  :)

If you haven\'t been watching it give Farscape a try. It\'s on Fridays on the 
Sci Fi Channel (if you get it, not sure about other countries...).

While the first episode was fairly hokey, I\'ve enjoyed the character 
development of the aliens and I\'ve also liked the baroque feel of the ship. 
Some of the stuff reminds me of George R.R. Martin\'s stories, especially "Tuf 
Voyaging" and "Nightflyers" (which was a better book than movie!).

The web site (farscape.com) gives some background on the aliens and the ship 
(the ship is alive, and the character named "Pilot" is actually a sort of 
symbiont lifeform to the ship lifeform). Each alien character seems to have a 
bit of a mystery around him or her (they are all, except for the other 
humaniti type humanoid, ex-prisoners).

It\'s relatively cheaply made, you\'ve got some Henson muppets, the acting 
isn\'t the Academy Award...but, I\'m enjoying it nonetheless. For example, in 
one recent episode, invading aliens used drugs to enhance their 
aggressiveness/strength. One of these aliens is captured and one of the 
ship\'s crew tries to "cure" him.

Now, if this were ST:TNG, or practically any other version of ST, the invader 
would be cured, his society would see the error of their ways, renounce their 
warlike ways and give up the drug. The Federation would be so overjoyed at 
getting another member they would overlook the slight infraction of the 
non-interference directive. 

(BTW, before you flame me, I do like ST and it\'s spinoffs...just get tired of 
the happy joy joy outlook of the Federation sometimes!)

However, in this episode, while the invader is cured, it is only temporary. 
Upon rejoining his fellows, he goes back on the drug. "My choice" he states. 
Not so happy a ending.

I\'ll keep watching and I hope you\'ll give it a try!

At last - a good reason for ships to jump from a stop with respect to
the planet they are leaving.

<IMTU>
I had always assumed that a ship\'s velocity when it jumped was carefully
constructed to optimse travel times in both systems, allowing for the
relative motion between the systems and the positions of the planets.
</IMTU>

So perhaps the stop to stop in system travel times and jumping from a
standstill rules can be used to support the fact that most ships are
drop ships and frontier free traders are an exception.

wondering if a more updated version had been created.  I remember 
last year reading about someone who was working on a project similar 
to this, and would be very interested in any previous attempts to 
plot the nearby star systems into a Traveller format.  More of a 
curiosity at this point, but I\'d still be interested.

Thanks for your time.  I now return you to your regularly scheduled

Folks:

It\'s a freaking game. As much as we like it, it\'s a game. Do we really need 
to goad each other? There\'s few enough of us out there that enjoy this 
game--do we really need to annoy each other? I\'d welcome anyone of you in my

Both sides will enrich my eventual game.)

Except that you could change the treaty to require an _unbroken_

You are thinking of helium.

Hydrogen liquifies at 20K and freezes at around 14K.

There\'s a little used federal law that makes it a *felony* to obtain
computer access or services via false information. I\'ve always thought
that this was the best way to deal with spam that has a forged address.

"Displacement tons" is a measure of *volume*. Depending on the version
of Traveller, one DT is either 14 cubic meters or 13.5 cubic meters. 
It\'s based on the volume of one ton of liquid hydrogen.

Helium does the weird superfluid stuff; I don\'t know if they have yet
solidified helium.

Hydrogen, on the other hand, is freezable. The recent infrared satellite
that failed depended on a block of frozen hydrogen to keep the detector
cold. The satellite was written off when, after a shutter inadvertently 
opened the interior to direct sun, the block evaporated away posthaste.

Consider Athos (from Lois Bujold\'s "Ethan of Athos"). Their economy
*does* consider the economic costs of raising children. It accounts for
around half their economic output.

Yep. I suspect that it\'d do the economy  (and society!) a lot of good
if we quit "hiding" these costs.

That\'s because it\'s in GT: Star Mercs (p. 67), not Far Trader:

"External cradle modules count against the turret-mounted weapons limit at
a rate of 3 modules per 1 turret."

I found out about the ruling after Far Trader had already gone to the
printer. It doesn\'t affect the LASH freighter in FT because she doesn\'t
have the maximum number of turrets anyway.

Never mind that -- beasts "that are on the earth". The K\'Kree

Unfortunately, the only thing to support this (drop tanks being TL15)
is one TNS press release.

As I pointed out before, all the design systems allow drop tanks
at all tech levels. There is no mention of special jump drives
in the rules, except (IIRC) a reference to a device that allows
the drive to use less than all the jump fuel when performing a
jump lower than its rating.

I would suggest that General Shipyards only developing drop tanks
after 1100 means that either they wanted a new solution that avoided
royalty payments or they are as incompetent a company as is sometimes
implied.

If so, is the Fatigue spent on the effort taken from the character\'s own

I guess more generally, does *any* vehicle design with a Strength rating

I personally have really enjoyed it, so far.  The characters are 
interesting, the ship is quite cool, and the show overall definitely 
feels different from Star Trek and other, harder s/f.  It\'s fun, 
kinda like Mind Candy.  I\'m interested in seeing where they take it.

True, but remember that not all of these functions are being performed
to
professional standards, so using professional rates of pay is an
inappropriate comparison.
Robert Prior
>>>> (end quoted material)
You are correct that few "housewives" could go out and get a
professional level job doing any or all of these without education and
training at professional levels.  However, this comparison is more along
the lines of what it might cost to replace a housewife with all these
different professionals doing their specialties.  There is a real cost
for sending the housewife to work, and this can\'t be ignored without
throwing off income/expense calculations.  (Again by "housewife" I am
indicating the primary caregiver in the household regardless of
gender).

But there you get into a question of what did the original Hebrew said.
Did it mean Earth (capital e) as in the world/planet or earth (lower case
e) as in the ground...  I suspect that in Hebrew the two are not the same
word (or maybe they are.  I dunno...) :)

This is a silly discussion.  Keep it up!

Droyne in Marin?  It almost makes sense when you realize that most of the

The One-Shot Railgun (page VE99) adds 50% to kinetic energy damage, while
halving the cost, weight and volume.

I did this design to make a weapon that an unarmored infantryman could
carry to destroy battledress with 1000+ pts of armor.  It\'s not light,
since each "shot" weighs about the sdame as a combat rifle, but it\'s cheap
enough to make BD troops a little wary.

>Btw, this weapon doesn\'t fire DU -- that would be an armor divisor of 3.
>Armor divisor of 5 is HD, and not available until GTL 11

Ooops.  So the GTL 11 version has the armor divisor of 5, and the GTL 10
version has a (3).

I\'m working on a 40mm version.

Ok, so it\'s a short barrel standard length muzzleloader (I guess) -- 29 lb.  Or
a very long, low power muzzleloader -- 36 lb.  Those two give the correct
damage.  Neither one has the range you indicate.

I\'m interested to see if Humans are descendents of the Peace

be Traveller\'ish (or H. Beam Piper\'ish).

I think you are correct. What happens to the others that don\'t ? Do the
Imperial just come in and say "This system is now Imperial Terratry." and deny
them access to Space ? The Imperium rules the space between the worlds ...

I like this version.  Long term training, and everything involved in

Indeed.  For those of us who remember FASA\'s ST rpg, the Klinks used any
number of \'servitor\' races for a variety of purposes.  Hmmmm, I feel a
new campaign coming on.....  8^)

ObTrav:  Why dont we write up some subject races for the K\'Kree, along
with their uses?

Oh this old discussion again.  Can\'t we get this in the FAQ under "Done to

forth about the Kosherness of K\'kree, only to hear it all again when the
"kosher for passover" label is brought up...

Then damage is wrong (should be 6d*18) and weight is _still_ wrong (should be
12) and range is _still_ wrong.  Extremely short barrel has the correct range
(and is only 6 lb with a rifle grip), but only does 6d*12, not 6d*24.

LH2 is for Liquid Hydrogen...keep in mind that H2 has a

as a reason there is long-distance interstellar trade.  Of
course this is a very useful idea: a pair of industrial worlds
mass produce widgets that are used by both worlds, and
thus everybody gets ahead.

The thing I was thinking is that large industrial worlds have
the infrastructure, the technology, and the population to
produce all the equipment they need; they might need food,
but they probably make transponders.  This follows along
with pocket empire rules that claim worlds can produce
starships locally -- I assume the parts are made and assembled
locally on average or better worlds.  Large-population worlds
can afford to diversify, and might even prefer to produce
locally at some level rather than import.  And, if you\'ve gotta
import stuff, you\'ll of course import from the nearest available
source.

I\'m still not convinced of the need for trade beyond a sector.
High value, low volume goods can be produced by industrial
worlds inside the sector -- perhaps only a subsector away.

That doesn\'t mean I\'ll rule it out, but it seems a stretch still.

Now, the most useful thing I got from your posts is this clue:
it takes about 1 billion people and helpful governments to make
a TL7/8 society.  That\'s a number I can use.  Now I start the
guesswork.  Do you think 1 billion people can produce a TL 9
society?  How about 2 billion people?  How about 10 billion?
Did 100 million people make a TL 4 or 5 society?

The Darrian confederation had over 10 billion people, and
eventually achieved TL 16.  Their people (and government)
were deeply rooted in research, but they had warships too,
and produced everything they needed for themselves.  They
mined worlds a subsector away, too, so there was trade,
prospecting, and exploitation going on.  And I\'ll allow that
they had an advantageous alignment of culture, government,
and resources.

No, that\'s the opposite issue.  By "polity", the original writer meant,
a political entity consisting of more than one star system.  The
Imperium wants to be the only interstellar political unit in the
Imperium.  Of course, it does make some de facto exceptions, like
government code 6 worlds (captured government).  (Vilis and
Garda-Vilis/Tanoose is a good example, detailed in one of the
adventures, I think Broadsword.)

So does that mean they can\'t be eaten, or that they can?  Or can they be
eaten only when they\'re not on the earth, but if they come to earth,
then you have to go through the Leviticus analysis?  Do these
commandments only apply on Terra, or on any world? but what about in
normal space? j-space?

As a jew (more or less; my mother\'s not), I would have a problem eating
K\'Kree, because they are sentient, and therefore eating them is close
enough to eating another human to be subject to the prohibition on
cannabilism (which isn\'t in Leviticus, so far as I know, but it must be
prohibited).  

Oy!  Problems like this to deal with in real life, we should be so lucky
to have.

External cradles are mentioned in both Star Mercs & Far Trader.
The cradles counting against turrets bit is in Star Mercs - bottom of page 67 -
3 cradles per turret space.

I suppose it is an oversight that it was not mentioned again in FT.

One mention makes it canon - right? :^)

I think you forgot to increase the mass of the thruster by 50% for a
vectored thruster.  A vectored thruster will allow thre ship to make turns
more easily for evasion and combat.  Non-vectored thrusters work kinda
like a rocket IIRC. To make a turn you must first turn the thruster off,
thereby coasting. Then use attitude control jets to steer, and then pop
the thruster back on to continue at new course and speed.

The other Tech versions use vectored thrust as a standard.

I made the same mistake the first time I tried to make TL-13 thrusters.

No it doesn\'t. That\'s a standard fuel purification rig.  And when you talking
about fusion power, HUGE is relatively small.

Anyway, the important thing for Jump drives is Volume.  If you can convert water
to hydrogen 50% more efficiently and not have to worry about cryo-containment, so
much the better.  Water also doesn\'t detonate very well.

If you use the all at once jumpdrive theory, then you gotta crack out all you\'ll
need for the jump before initiating it.  If you use the slow burn over the course
of a week, then you can crack water as you go.

Using that extra 50% fuel could result in a jump 5 (6x) and a jump 2 (3x) for a
nice two week journey of 7 parsecs.  The cracked oxygen (which can be cryocooled
to aproximately water density) can then be used to recycle the lifesupport or used
as reaction mass for the insystem trip.

Really!? That just shows you how different people are. My players *love* the Utility Vest - their characters wear them all the time to the point where I get tired of hearing the same old description:

"I\'m wearing my utility vest, remote earpiece, data/display headset..." etc.

We\'ve actually reached a point where we\'ve considered compiling a Travellers\' Starter Kit including all that nifty stuff that PCs go out and buy anyway (but then we thought better of it).

Sometimes I need to ask them:

Yes, the \'starburst\' special effect (jump drive?) and the fact the the

me think if the creator/writers were Traveller players! :-).

This show has quite a bit of adventure material...

modern word \'brigand\' and the name Britain itself are derived) were very
much matrilineal and matriarchal. In this case, the queen ruled on behalf of
the goddess, but her husband was responsible for managing the people of the
tribe and the use of force. Similar to the situation in early Ur and other
Mesopotamian city states (read the Epic of Gilgamesh for the earliest
documented political struggle against exactly this arrangement).

The fact is, systems of rule so different from our own are poorly understood
if viewed as \'types\' of our own politics. Try explaining US politics to a

	I think you missed the part where I described the sorts of things for 
which economies of scale are most important.  They\'re not "mass produced 
widgets" they\'re the highly specialized pieces of equipment that every 
industrial world would like to have but does not have a big enough market to 
make production cost effective.  Several industrial worlds together might 
make have a large enough market to break even, but with a dozen of them the 
market becomes large enough for the specialist gear to become quite 
affordable.
	Many people on this list are military history buffs and over the years 
I have heard many references to things that might qualify for the kind of 
specialist gear status to which I am referring.  I have heard that the 
Congress is continuing to buy a few subs every couple of years to keep the 
incredibly array of special manufacturing skills necessary to do that job 
intact.  Other people have mentioned that the Navy had to call people out of 
retirement to service battleships because no one in the Navy or at the 
shipyards had the necessary skills.  Another frequent topic of conversation 
is whether we could still build Saturn V rockets.  Most people who know 
anything about it say that we could not because there\'s no one left who 
knows how to build all the requisite components.  What\'s important here is 
that there is a demand for a skill or piece of equipment, but the demand is 
not large enough for the market to continue to provide that skill or 
equipment.  

>The thing I was thinking is that large industrial worlds have

>but they probably make transponders.

	Even if they are technically capable of producing everything they 
need, there are still large gains from trade.  By specializing and then 
trading for what they don\'t specialize in, even large industrial worlds can 
end up wealthier.

>I\'m still not convinced of the need for trade beyond a sector.

>worlds inside the sector -- perhaps only a subsector away.

Maybe they could, I don\'t know because I\'ve never been on a TL-15 industrial 
world.  I can, however, show you that it is _possible_ to economically ship 
something multiple sectors.

Let\'s say that Capitol is about 350pcs away from Glisten along the trade 
routes.  It costs 400Cr/pc (in GT) to ship a dton of goods so that comes to 
140,000Cr for the journey.  Let\'s say Glisten is considering importing 
Neural Activity Sensors.  The hand-held versions are .5lbs and 20,000Cr.  
Since the NAS is so light and is hand-held, let\'s say that when packed it 
takes up one cubic foot.  In GT there are 500 cubic feet per displacement 
ton, so we can fit 500 NAS units in a one dton shipping container.  That one 
container of freight is worth 500*20,000 = 10MCr.  The cost of the journey 
is 140,000Cr, which is only 1.4% of the cost of the goods.  Therefore, if 
Capital has a price advantage through economies of scale or some other means 
of only 1.4%, it will be economical for Glisten to import NAS scanners all 
the way from Core Sector.  

Note that even if the goods to be shipped were two whole orders of magnitude 
less valuable, the cost of shippment would not even triple their price.  
Considering the Real World economies of scale available  today in many 
goods, it is not at all unreasonable to suppose that there are items that 
cost a third as much when produced in bulk rather than small batches.

I have no idea.  The important point is the increasing complexity of the 
skills and equipment necessary to support increasingly high tech societies.  
The minimum number of people is not important to my point, the number of 
people where the gains from additional people reach the point of diminishing 
returns _is_ important.  If 100 trillion people are better than 10 trillion 
people for a TL-15 society, then we have a good reason for trade.

The Darrians are obviously exceptional in many ways.  I have posted my 
explanation for the Darrians\' success before.  Instead of repeating it, I 
will give you an equally canonical reference that supports the case for 
multi-sector trade. 

The Traveller Adventure, pg. 136: "Naasirka is a megacorporation which 
predates the founding of the Imperium.  Its emphasis is on computers, and it 
is best known as the supplier of communications equipment to the xboat 
service.  Other fields it operates in include ship construction (primarily 
small craft) and software.  Naasirka also operates a transport line 
connecting Vland with Rhylanor."

		Really!? That just shows you how different people are. My

Depends on how well the ship\'s been maintained, etc.  There\'s a chart in LOM that you can roll on to figure out who wants to buy the boat, what fraction of \'book\' value they\'ll pay, etc.  Course, you probably don\'t have LOM...

Not really, because the arrival of the K\'Kree would be very much like
Independence Day, and since they are so conservative, Jeff Goldblum\'s
little Mac laptop trick wouldn\'t work...too advanced. I wonder if we

    'body' => 'Dave:

Being a Classic Traveller referee and seeing the lack of self
improvement, my players and I have come up with a Traveller-esque
experience system, that seems to have lasted fairly well over the
years.  I started refereeing in 1979 - 80:

1)  If a member of the PC party had instructor skill, that individual
could teach another PC to a skill one level less than the skill being
taught, based upon the Instructor skill.  Example:  Instructor 3, Pilot 6
teaches level:  Pilot 2.  

Time requried per skill level:  One year if  "After Hours" (2hrs per day),
six months "Part Time"  (4hrs per day) and three months "Full Time" (8hrs
per day).

2)  If a PC had a particularly exceptional roll (BoxCars or 18+), an
asterisk was 
assigned to the skill.  This was then converted into an additional skill
level per asterisk
at the end of a PC\'s adventure year.  Not real time play, but adventure time 
based upon the Imperial calendar.  The maximum I allow for skills to reach
is six (6).

3)  After a PC earned 1MCr, their Social Standing went up.  Simulates
the creation of the Nouveau Riche Syndrome.  Nobility did not come until
an appropriate deed had been done to warrant a nomination.  Fees for
"Knighthood" are usually to the tune of 1MCr to the Sector Noble in power.
Dukes and Duchesses always have the right to create new nobility.  That\'s
another way to finance their own positions.  Also, the creation of knightly
orders 
within the Imperium allows direct funding of royal personages.    Another
way to
get into an order is posthumously, but that only helps your spouse and
offspring.

4)  I also developed the "RNA Implant".  If a PC desired a particular
skill, then
an RNA implant could be paid for to bring the PC\'s skill level up or allow
a new skill to be learned.  The maximum level any skill could be brought
up to is six (6).  Everything was based upon a 20KCr price per skill level
with a
1d6 times 10KCr rolled for additional medical fees.  The maximum number of
times I allowed this per PC was two in a lifetime.  The brain just couldn\'t
handle
the additional input.

5)  I also have ways to develop Strength, Dexterity and Endurance.  But I don\'t
have those at my finger tips.  Will get back later.  The maximum I allow a PC
to have in those Primary stats is 18 for a human.  Other races may have lower
or higher stat maximums.  I have recently been batting around the idea of
improving Psi Strength.  Not sure how this could change the mechanics IMTU.

I think the T4 system can get to be subjective, that\'s why I really didn\'t
incorporate
it with the above.  Just some ideas and food for thought.

The Peace Keepers\' race was called the Seldanians (sp?).  Apparently 
they greatly resemble humans, but have next to no tolerance for 
temperatures much over room temp.

I would like to see some connection between the Seldanians and 
Humans, if only as an explanation for their extremely similar 
appearance.  None of the other aliens shown greatly resemble one 
another (except for Dago\'s race and their genetic cousins, and the 
writers covered that connection.)

What I\'m interested in learning more about are Xan\'s people and their 
customs.  :)

	Berkeley has the only undergraduate program in Celtic Studies in the 
United States.  When I was a student there I took a class in the department 
which covered basic Celtic myths, beliefs, government systems, etc.  It was 
certainly made clear that women enjoyed a great deal of equality, but it was 
never mentioned or even hinted that Celts were ever matriarchal.  Given 
where I was taking the class I don\'t think this was from any lack of desire 
to be PC.  Do you have some reputable sources for this?
	The reference to "the goddess" I also find suspect.  It is a term I\'ve 
only heard from "New Age" sources and it was again not something ever 
brought up in my course.  I also am wondering in what way the queen might be 
said to rule if her husband had responsibility for management and warfare.  
What\'s left?

I\'ve had characters in my games claim that since Combat Armor is a military

RECALL ALERT!

Gridlore Technologies has ordered an immediate recall of its 20mm IAAW system.

"Evidently, it violates some law of physics or the other." said Cassandra
Gridlore CXXI, GT\'s Hereditary Legal Consul.

Users should send the weapon, in the original packing, with all the
original Styrofoam peanuts (we check) to:

The Imperium probably charges them an arm and a leg in tarriffs.

For a large, prosperous nation, that\'s bearable (sse the discussion on
cutting off trade to a world for more details.)  For example, if the Little
Green Men came down today, and offered us membership in the Galactic
People\'s Revolutionary Collective, the United States could probably exist
without the offworld trade.

And lets not forget the occassional bizare oddity -- during the gold rush
in California (1849) it was not uncommon for dirty laundry to be loaded
onto ships, sent to China to be cleaned, and then returned to the States.

Economically sensible???  Well it must have made sense under the
conditions -- nobody in California wanted to be doing laundry when they
could be hunting for gold instead.

Just thought I\'d toss that into the mix. Some things that seem
inexplicable might be sensible under the right conditions.

_Imperial_ practice.  Grand Prince Isharii isn\'t necessarily an
_Imperial_ noble; he\'s merely the head of state and head of
government of a member world.  Cryogametopreservation doesn\'t
necessarily happen.  Eleven thousand worlds, each with (probably)
at least one baron, separate from the _local_ power structure.
Plus Marquises, Counts, and Dukes.  And would the President of
the Republic of Saint Martin be cryogametopreserved?  He doesn\'t
have a noble title from Saint Martin, nor from the Imperium, but
he is the equal of Grand Prince Isharii, whose title as Prince
Royal of Carlsmont derives from the _local_ culture.

If you assume that it does, however, you\'ve given some
interesting possible twists.

The same background could also quite possibly be used, if Ramduur
is a twin, for a "Prisoner of Zenda"-type complication - or a
"Prince and the Pauper" scenario.  Lots of room here for referees
to play.  That\'s why I called it a "hook" instead of an
adventure.

Which is what IMO should be used for alot of the canon bugs.  At least for 
the OTU.  Anyone\'s own TU is their business, of course, if that even needs to

That is what was said about them.  Whether this is reasonable or not depends 
on teh intricacies of jump drives, which is another ball of fur.  ;-)  I was 
looking at them for some of my own FF&S (original) ship designs (300-400) and 
found it was in the hundreds of thousands, per drop tank, IIRC.

Sure looked like an analysis.  ;-)  There hasn\'t been anything in the way of 
refuting it, either.  There was also an MT one with the same results.  The 
cost advantage is offset by the complexity (comparable to LASH IIRC).  I now 
have Far Trader and must say it looks quite excellent.  Particularly, there 
are no glaring typos or immediate erratta that jump out at me (and I do view 
the SJG erratta page).

It\'s the particular timeframe that\'s the issue.  Not the end result,which 
noone disputes.  It\'s very debatable (and has been disputed w/ Far Trader and 
MT, of which TNE and Merchant Prince are the same IIRC, w/o refutation) that 
it will be in a short enough time period to invalidate any of the canon 
setting.  Now the future?  Sure.  But that\'s the way things should be.  
Shipping gets revolutionized.  New tech.  New methods of doing things.  etc 
etc.

There\'ve been a couple that have precluded the need for me to do so.  I am 
interested in seeing the other side\'s, so i can decide what the Reformation 
Coalition is going to do w/ drop tanks for MTU.  Particularly if the new 
shipping is going to be using drop tanks, or whether the complixity and costs 
of drop tank shipping will mostly cancel out the benefits, on the smaller 
scale the RC is.  There hasn\'t yet been anything from the other side...

actually, what the 49ers would do is sell their old clothes to the ship
captians, who would then take it to China where it would be cleaned and
meanded, and then be brought back to San francisco to be sold as
second-hand clothes.  The clothing was used to line the hold for more
important cargoes.

It\'s also interesting to note that many of SF\'s early buildings were
actually ships that were de-masted, hauled up on shore, overturned and had
a door cut into them.  As we continue building, we keep finding these "Gold
Mansions" at various points of the city.

I am actually interested in anything objective (read: number crunching) you 
might have, though I don\'t really expect to see anything.  Your opinion 
hasn\'t proven up to snuff, though, as I\'m sure mine hasn\'t to you.

I\'m not interested in the last word.  You post to anyone in a public forum 
and I\'ll respond, if I have the desire to.

You have??  Or from a previous discussion of this topic?  Could you repeat

I\'m not interested in \'claiming victory,\' either.  Very little minds get 
changed, though mine isn\'t yet made up.  I want to know whether the RC should 
be using them or not.  Now that I have Far Trader, i\'m going to use it to run 
some numbers (it\'s on the queue of things to do), eventually.

That they\'re the end of Traveller economics as we know it (which sums up how 
I perceived your argument) has not been proven (indeed, seems to have been 
effectively disputed by others).

Completely Insane Handwave for Figuring a World\'s

Take your favorite world.  What\'s its theoretical maximum

my handwave to figure that out.  (Note: I\'d probably use
Pocket Empires or even Classic Traveller instead of this
system, but it\'s interesting to look at other formulae):

Population   Max TL
1             1
1000          2
60,000        3
1 million     4

280 million   7
1 billion     8
3 billion     9
10 billion    A
26 billion    B
62 billion    C
138 billion   D
289 billion   E
576 billion   F
1 trillion    G
2 trillion    H
3.5 trillion  J

( formula: TL^10 = minimum population)

Bonuses:
+1 per planetoid belt (TL9+)
+1 if there are gas giants (TL9+)
+1 if industrial world
+1 if rich world
perhaps a bonus for certain government types


So, Sol\'s maximum TL may be C or D, if we top out at
40 billion people and spread them out among the belt, Mars,
etc.  Beats me how long that exploitation can be sustained.

I am reminded of two items:  Harry Turtledove\'s short story "The
R-Strain", about a gengineered pig that chews a cud (a noted rabbi is
asked to determine whether R-strain pigs are therefore kosher) ; and
Joel Rosenberg\'s stories about the Metzadan Mercenary Corps, in which it
is stated that, off Metzada, the dietary rules don\'t apply.  (One
retired merc, off-world for the first time in years, marks the occassion
by having a bacon cheeseburger.)

It is true that it can get subjective, but as a referee I find it useful.  
The T4 system is the only one that alows the referee to grant exp rewards 
based on game-oriented goals. Here\'s an example of how it can be used (from 
one of the adventures of mine you can find at Freelance Traveller): 

Abject Failure:   If the players end up in prison for illegal activities or 
fail meet the terms for initial employment, then the patron will not pay, the 
troopers will quit and the characters receive no experience points.

Failure:    If the contents of the merchant ship are destroyed by a bomb or 
rioters, or the base captured by the attackers, then the mission is a 
failure.   Any remaining troopers will quit the unit, and the patron will not 
pay.  Each surviving character receives 1 experience point. 

Success:  If the ship and its cargo is intact with only minor additional 
damage, but the unit or base personnel have suffered fatalities, then the 
patron will pay the 100,000cr, and each character will receive 2 experience 
points.  Each wounded NPC soldier will quit the unit, and players must roll 
an Average Leadership skill task to retain each other soldier in the unit. 

Complete Success:  if the ship and its cargo is intact with no additional 
damage and the unit has suffered no fatalities, then the patron will pay the 
agreed upon 100,000cr, the soldiers in the unit will want to continue in the 
player\'s employ, and each character will receive 3 experience points.


It works nicely with the T4 experience system, but it is imperative that the 
referee decide before the adventure what goals need to be met to get an 
experience point.
The dowside is that the T4 system is the only system where the skill gaining 
technique is divorced from the character generation system.  A character 
could conceiveably gain 3 low level skills after one adventure.

T4.1 is best in that regard as players gain skills at about the same rate as 
they did while in service (although slightly slower: 1 per year instead of 
about 1.5 per year).
T4.1 however allows easier access to high level skills, it is just as easy to 
get Medic-9 as it is to get Rifle-2.

In comparison, in T4 if you wanted to get Medic-6 skill, your incentive is to 
gain as many exp. points as possible during a year, and keep rolling for that 
6.  In T4.1, the sensibkle thing to do is get one * in medic, and then lay 
low for the rest of the year.

I agree that the CT system is probably most realisitic--you learn skills by 
going to an instructor.   There are advantages to that (and it\'s another way 
to suck away PC\'s money).   But I like the link between skill use and skill 
improvement

Actually, all that was needed was the reference to megacorporations.
If long-haul trade isn\'t feasible, then megacorps are less feasible.  On
the other hand, introduce long-haul trade and megacorps become so
very powerful.

Also, Jim\'s example helped quite a lot.  It\'s nice to see examples.
I do recall that we can\'t build battleships or Saturn Vs anymore.  We
can\'t get to the moon anymore!

So let me get this straight: there are industrial items in the Imperium
which are necessary for high-tech worlds to have, but are only made
on a few worlds because demand is low.

For instance:

   Starport components
   Municipal power plants (i.e. huge ones)
   Belt refineries and mining equipment
   Factories
   Military starships
   Starships larger than 99,999 tons
   Spinal weapons (ah, this is military, eh?)
   Hydroponics facilities
   Domed cities / grav cities / orbital colonies

I think this is going to take some time to digest, but it sounds reasonable...

	You are right.  While in general women enjoyed more freedom and 
equality among Celts and Germans than among Romans, and among Romans than 
among Greeks, and among Greeks more than Middle Eastern cultures,  the idea 
that Celts were matriarchal is a modern conceit without ancient documentary 
support.   THe closest you get to mention of a matriarchal society in the 
ancient world might be a description of the women-ruled tribes  in Tacitus\' 
Germania--and notice that these are said to be the most remote and distant 
from the Romans who are Tacitus\' source  (suspiciously far enough away to be 
of any depenable use).

Gotta love players.  Under Imperial military regulations, of course,
armor is undress uniform, not dress, and therefore the PCs will be
inadequately attired to obtain admission to the Ball.  It would be a bit
like showing up in camouflaged hunting clothes or a football uniform
when they should be in black tie or an evening gown.

If they were guards at the Ball, of course, the uniform of the day might
be armor -- and guards of the Archduke\'s Own Ashigaru certainly keep one
set of armor in perfect condition, to be worn only for inspections and
special events.

Are you sure about that? I\'ve always assumed that the Imperium didn\'t
like member multi-world polities (though I don\'t actually think that
is spelled out anywhere), but that it accepts it in some cases. An
example is Vilis and its colony world Garda-Vilis. Come to that, all
the megacorporations are, in a way, multi-world polities (all of them
control a number of worlds outright). And there\'s a number of other
colony worlds  shown in various UWP listings.

You beat me to it.  : )  A good reference is on pg 5 of AM 2.  Basically that 
their highly valued because of their rarity, but with suspicions on their 
mental stability.  They\'re allowed leeway where another in a different K\'kree 
combat arm would be disciplined.

I also imagine RCVs would be popular too.  That, and lots of missiles and 
point defense.  K\'kree "Patrols" probably consist of huge (by Imperial/human

Hmm...  I think i\'ve got to brew up an adventure or two with some K\'kree... 
haven\'t done it yet.

One government type that could lead to bonuses is Type 7,
Balkanization.  The competition between rival nations on one world could
easily stimulate innovation.  Those nations that fail to innovate
technologically tend to get themselves conquered, or at least dominated,
by their more advanced neighbors.  Sort of a macro version of the old
saying, "There are two kinds of people:  the quick, and the dead."

Owned worlds are one thing, The Federation of Planets are another. The
Imperium doesn\'t want any rivals.

As far as megacorps go, yes they are multi-world; but the Imperium, in
many ways _is_ the megas, and vice versa. The heads of the megas are
likely very highly placed nobles. A very intertwined system so that
what\'s good for Marikhadun is good for the Imperium, and vice versa...

I understand that the logarithmic curve is a very useful toy.

This might be a problem.  There are thousands of societies in the Imperium,
separated by time/distance and culture.  Traveller seems to focus on
worlds or star systems, rather than its population.  Thus, there
aren\'t 15 trillion people; there are 11,000 worlds.  1 trillion people won\'t
be pulling in one direction; there will be something like 10,000 different
directions, with a local poulation pulling in each direction.  Moreover, each
domain will have its own goals; likewise sectors, subsectors, counties, and
worlds.

The most long-haul trade I see is done by megacorporations, which
basically buy goods locally and then ship between their own divisions
for redistribution.  A megacorp can absorb massive inventory costs
and can afford to wait for favorable markets.


Okay then, those who must order transsector, will.  But I don\'t think
we\'ll be able to find any labor pool greater than the tens of billions for
any one fabricated item.  I guess then what we need is a list of items
that a starfaring civilization absolutely needs but probably won\'t
produce.  Then divide each item into subcomponents, and say that
each industrial world builds a certain number of one of these
subcomponents.

Yah, that would do it.

Starport components
Municipal power plants
Belt refineries
Factories
Very large starship hulls
Spinal weapons
Hydroponics
High-tech city platforms

Say then that there are 4 subcomponents to each of the categories
above.  An industrial world will build one of these subcomponents.
So if your sector has 16 industrial worlds, you\'ve got a 50% chance
that half of these subcomponents are build in your sector.

And it\'s not that an industrial world can\'t build all of them: it\'s just
that demand is low, specialization is high, so it\'s better for all worlds
involved to focus on one thing, do it well, and everyone makes
money.

Okay, I like that.  I like that a lot.

Where did you get that figure? I\'ve been trying to find a figure for the

I\'d be really pleased.

My own SWAG came to 600 million.

        I just can\'t imagine any fleet admiral who will voluntarily move his
vessels within range of several dozen factor-T or *larger* meson sites that
he has to give the first three or four shots each free to (see triangulation
arguement in other thread) and are protected by two or three USP 9 meson
screens each.  I can\'t see it not being a slaughter...  
        It only gets worse if you give planet-based systems an extra range
band in High Guard, allowing them to get a round or two of fire which the
invader cannot respond to due to range.  Add in "icky-messies" like
multi-stage silo-launched 100-megaton thermonuclear missles aimed at his
"small stuff" like tankers, escorts and troop carriers, and I just don\'t see
how an invasion would happen.  I think the invader would mutiny first.

Hm. But what about life on other planets?  Would the rabbis interpret
"earth" to mean planet, and thus each planet would have its list of kosher
foods? Would only earthlife be kosher? Or would all non-terrestrial animals
not be covered (and therefore allowed)?

anyone know enough about Islam to hazard an opinion?

True. But, to pick an example, your average houseperson isn\'t a trained
psychotherapist, so even if they perform that function, to replace them you
wouldn\'t need to pay psychotherapist rates. You local psychic would be
cheaper (and, judging my some housepersons I\'ve interected with, just as
good as a houseperson).

I guess what I should have stated is that you need to find out how much it
would cost to pay someone to perform the job _with the same training/skill
as the houseperson  performs it_ to make a valid comparison.

The only opinion I could hazard is that the God of the Jew is held to be
the creator of the entire universe.  There would be many new volumes of
Talmudic commentary produced on the occasion on _any_ extra-terrestrial
discovery of life.  I hope, though, that these tomes will not be
published on the TML. Then again, if intelligent life were discovered
off planet, they might be Jews with additional revelation ;-)

If this were to happen how about ruling that any gas giant "detected" in
a system that doesn\'t have a gas giant in Traveller is a gas giant that
cannot be used to fuel a ship.  Could anyone produce a pseudo-scientific
reason for a "gas giant" to be void of harvestable hydrogen?

AFAIK (And I am by no means qualified to answer this), this is something
that only happens on nuclear-powered ships (I\'ve only seen it in context of
a sub, but I see no reason this can\'t be used in other vessels).  A SCRAM
is the process of flooding the reactor with seawater in order to cool it
rapidly.  This is only done in _extreme_ emergencies, as it pretty much
destroys the reactor and floods the local ecosystem with tons of very
radioactive water.  AFAIK this has never actually been done IRL.

It seems to me that there is no way to SCRAM a reactor in space (unless
maybe you use the LH2 as a coolant?) and this doesn\'t apply to fusion.  To
stop a fusion reactor, simply vent the plasma overboard.

Again, I could be wrong here....

	We beat you to this one! :-)  The correct answer is cargo containers!  
Many of the cargo containers in Far Trader would make great modular housing.  
In fact, IIRC, some are even designed for that purpose.  And don\'t forget 
the Modular Cutter pre-fab base modules.  I love the idea of a bunch of low-
tech scruffy types huddled around an E starport living in old cargo 
containers.  At some starports, the refined fuel tanks, office, etc. could 
all be old cargo containers.

Until the first nation on Earth bought some advanced technology that puts everything we\'ve got now in the Stone Age.  We\'re about TL8 (CT, not GURPS), think what would happen if some TL15 toys started coming onto the market.

There was a story about the culture shock of a high tech society exporting \'toys\' to a lower tech society called \'Mozart In Mirrorshades\'.  Can\'t remember what book it was in, though.

What a SCRAM is, is, the control rods slam home into the reactor, shutting off 
the fission.  It doesn\'t hurt the reactor, it stops the reactor from melting 
down from the reactions.

Sure there is.  A CNO catalyst fusion reactor just needs its fuel supply cut.  
No fuel, no reaction.  A SCRAM would be a solenoid slamming home, cutting off 
fuel flow to the reactor.  The fusion pulses stop, and the magnetic field 
collapses shortly thereafter, the reactor vessel venting rapidly cooling 
plasma into space.  Congratulations, you\'re now on battery backup.

I thought Abydos was the Gwauld\'s planet on \'Stargate: SG1\'.  Course, they\'d worship A-mooooon-Ra as a deity there...

SCRAM: An emergency shutdown of a nuclear reactor, done by driving
control rods to the bottom of the core using springs. A term left over
from the 1940\'s when primitive lab reactors had a single control rod
suspended by a rope. An emergyency shutdown would be done by cutting the
rope and letting the rod drop by gravity. The safety man was called the
Safety Control Rod Ax Man - Hence SCRAM.

I *THINK* you could simply shut down a fusion reactor - they\'re not
supposed to runaway like a fission reactor. So cutting the power should
kill the reactor.

It\'s an acronym.  Can\'t for the life of me remember what it stands for...

Just cut the fuel feed.  Can\'t run a fusion reactor without fuel.  And LHyd 
ain\'t kept inside the reactor like fissionables are.  Like I said earlier, a 
simple solenoid snapping a valve shut would do the trick...

satisfying, I must say.

I am running at several conventions, including Gen Con and most of the cons
in Florida. You can see stuff about the games I run at:

http://develand.home.mindspring.com/traveller/

I ran CT for a long time, but found the rules fragmented by development over
a great deal of time. I think GURPS in general is benefiting from a clear,
complete view of the Traveller universe from the very start, along with a
well-developed rules systems. Not much is created in a vacuum, and that
which is top-notch from the team at SJG.

The Vargr stuff was wonderful in Alien Races 1, and the Zhodani stuff
clarified a lot of cloudy, seemingly arbitrary characteristics about the
Zhodani. Far Trader is the coolest game books I have seen in a long time. I
wish the GURPS Traveller deckplans were better, though. All the background
detail is fascinating, and there is so much rich adventure opportunity, it\'s
almost hard to find a place to start writing scenarios!

General Steve Jackson Games opinion:
Best game company around and I will continue to support them by running con
games and buying books. I am a bit disappointed in convention support
though. Monica Stephens is overworked. I am running more than 15 GURPS
Convention games this year, and I\'m not even on the MIB list and almost
never get a e-mail reply to my queries. The computer she works on seems
pretty bad too. I wish they would go to Gen Con.

General GURPS opinion:
The only thing I dislike, rather then just don\'t quite grasp, are the
massive number of skills and the variations on how defaults work with the
introduction of Compendium I. Some are IQ-4, some -5, some at another
skill -3, some at -4 or something else and perhaps a combination of several.
I would have liked to have seen the defaults streamlined and the skill list
reduced. These are personal feeling not shared with many others, I suspect.

Someone was talking (here?) about the way fusion reactors in Weber\'s
Honor Harrington books had a way of exploding when damaged. IIRC
the final guess we came up with was that Weber\'s fusion reactors were
actually more akin to perpetual fusion bomb explosions contained by
high-capability gravitics tech. Damage to something like that would be
very, very bad.

SCRAM=Safety Control Reactor Axe-Man

A SCRAM is an attempt to stop a fission reaction quickly by 
introducing neutron absorbers immediately.  The acronym dates from 
early fission reactors: the control rods were suspended above hte 
reactor and lowered in and out to control the rate of reaction.  The 
safety control reactor axe man cut the ropes with and axe in the event 
of an emergency.  Nuclear submarines use water to stop the fission.

I suppose you could SCRAM an out of control fusion reactor, by 
introducing a bunch of nonfusionable material quickly.  Flooding a 
chamber with a noble gas would be an idea, but if things have gone too 
far, the gas will just fuse and everything will blow something fierce. 
 Stopping the introduction of H2 would probably work even better- no 
fuel, no reaction, no explosion.  Keep the containment up and you\'re 
set.

Fleet Tactics skill will be crucial to managing task forces in _Fleet Ops_,

planning on factoring it out of the rules all together (assume same levels
on each side so they factor out), but that doesn\'t match well with the 
ability to add PC\'s to the game - I\'ll at least need to know what I\'m
factoring out, so I can reduce a PC Admiral\'s effective Fleet Tactics skill
accordingly.

So, bring on the guesses - what\'s the average Fleet Tactics level of a

I\'m not looking for the incompetent Santoneechev\'s or the Masterful

	CT used 14 m^3, as the (approximate) volume of 1 metric ton of
liquid hydrogen. But that was a bit inconvenient for drawing deck
plans drawn with 1.5m squares, and MT redefined 1 metric ton of
liquid hydrogen as being 13.5 m^3 (two 1.5m squares and 3m deck
height). TNE decided it was better to change deck plans, to 2m
squares and a 3.5m deck height (hence 1 square was 0.5Td). T4, if I
recall correctly, went back to 1.5m squares, and 14m^3 displacement
tons ...

Put it this way -- I bought a copy shortly after it became available
in this part of the universe. I loved it. One of the guys in my biweekly
Champions game had played Traveller in the past, and was interested in 
seeing it. So a few weeks later I brought it with me to the game. The 
collective response: "So, when are we going to start a GURPS Traveller 
campaign?"

(Starting this coming Saturday night, actually... with me running it.)

One place to start would be the movie "Dr. Strangelove" (1964, dir.: 
Stanley Kubrick).  Slim Pickens, as a B-52 pilot, is walking his aircrew
through an inventory of their survival kits.  Replace references to
things Russian with their Zhodani equivalents, and you have a pretty
good start.  However, it is _mandatory_ that you conclude the inventory
with the following sentence:

"Shoot, a fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that
stuff!"

Is there such a thing as "Imperial Marriage?" I mean, does Lunion care if
you\'ve been married on Regina or not? As I understand it, Imperial laws -
in my mind, the only laws enforceable cross-planet - do not cover such
mundane issues as marriage.

How about if you get married on World A, where monogamy is the law, then
get married again on Planet B, where polygamy is legal? Can your wife on
Planet A have you prosecuted? Does it matter whether you are a "citizen"
of planet A or Planet B? What if you\'re neither?

This brings up another point -- do citizens of the Imperium also have to
hold planetary citizenship, or can they declare themselves "worldless" and
just be Imperial Citizens?

Thoughts?

First of all, its all on your passport.  You just fork over some cash and they
stamp it all legal like.  Anybody that can afford interstellar travel shouldn\'t

From what I understand, Hydrogen fusion requires a pretty significant
pressure and temperature.  Probably some sort of magnetic containment.
Without the pressure, the atoms wouldn\'t fuse.  Thus, drop the containment
field and the reactor shuts down plus some stray radiation.  Things will
still be hot, but not explosive.

Personally, I prefer Helium-3 fusion, its much cleaner.

Does the Imperium require documentation similar to a passport?
I didn\'t run my game that way.  Such documentation would pretty
much require an Imperial presence on every planet in the Imperium.
While I do see them issuing "Starship Papers", documentation
for individuals would be very hard to justify, given that Imperial
census data seems to be limited to counts and the Imperium
apparently doesn\'t require planetary government to register every
unique individual.

I did rule that the Imperium requires starship captains to maintain
an accurate cargo list... including DNA samples (or alien equiv.)
for sentient cargo.  These manifests must be transmitted to
Imperial authorities upon request.  Captains found to be
carrying undocumented sentients risk ship seizure. Assuming
no fraud, such documents are far more useful in tracking
individuals than typical "passports".

I\'d argue that Planet X would almost always consider all non-Planet X
citizens to be generic "Imperial Citizens", as verification of any other
form of citizenship would be impossible and irrelevent.  The Imperium
may require individuals travelling from system-to-system to declare a
birthworld, but current citizenship may likewise be impossible to prove,
as many low population or low tech world wouldn\'t have the ability to
document such things.

J. Andrew Keith wrote the Pilot\'s Guide to Caledon Subsector (published in
Traveller Chronicle 5-7) in which the worlds 2214, 2313, and 2315 (marked
Ok [Kolan Hegemony] in the Atlas of the Imperium) is a polity that was
absorbed into the Imperium and is still recognized by the Imperium.  "The
Hegemony is considered a part of the Imperium, but is administratively
independent from the authority of the neighboring Nightrim subsector, which
governs other Imperial territory in this area."  This arrangement has been
in place since the latter stages of the Aslan Border Wars.  At that time
three other worlds were part of the Hegemony.  One has since left the
Hegemony and the Imperium.  The other two are no longer administered from
the Hegemony and are fully Imperial worlds.

I don\'t remember seeing anything about the Imperium not admitting polities.
 I know they set up the Vegan Autonomous Region and the League of Antares
(just spinward and rimward of Antares itself), but I also seem to recall
that the Easter Concorde was admitted to the Imperium.

I am not saying that is not true, but I don\'t remember seeing it...of
course I never really thought about it before either.

Traveller even provides us examples such as the Imperial Reaumur and
Infrequent Refuge (AHL class) that brings Tokaj Eszencia wine from Terra to
Capital, and the Aslan corporation (I can\'t remember the name off hand)
that started out importing dust spice from Romar (in Glisten subsector) to
Kusyu.

A simple reflective coating will handle that. Basicly a thin layer of
aluminized mylar (like one of those pocket sized "rescue blankets").

Have the chunk of hydrogen ice be hollow, you thaw it from the inside.
Towards the very end, the plastic film will be holding a mixture of
liquid, solid and gaseous hydrogen.

Not a lot harder than liquefying it in the first place.

It will sublime. But *slowly*. Otherwise comets couldn\'t exist. Nor

12 parts carbon. Carbon is general atomic weight 12. 14 is an uncommon
isotope.

Actually, with a reaction drive you want your exhaust to be as *light*
as possible. That\'s because for a given temperature, a heavier molecule
or atom moves more slowly (temp is related to kinetic energy).

No, you are thinking of Helium. Hydrogen will freeze at -259.2 C.

Helium doesn\'t form molecules, so you are dealing with individual
atoms. And the "zero-point energy" of helium at 0 K is still enough to
keep it liquid. You actually have to apply *pressure* to get helium to
freeze. 

Hydrogen *does* have its own special problems. There are *two* type of
hydrogen molecule. Ortho and para. In one, the spins of the atoms point
the same direction. In the other they point in opposite directions. 

There\'s a noticeable energy difference between the two types. Switching
in one direction releases energy, switching in the other requires
energy. So eventually, all of the hydrogen will wind up in the lower
energy form. But the energy released by the transitions is enough to
*boil* LH2. So to be able to store LH2 without most of it boiling away,
you have to convert it all to the low energy state. Luckily, catalysts
have been found that will trigger the change. So you just run the LH2
across the catalyst and collect the gas that gets given off. The gas
gets re-liquefied, the liquid that\'s been thru the catalyst goes into
storage.

While my history classes (sorry, ASU isn\'t quite on the ball yet with
"Cletic studies") are probably not the equal of Berkely, I did take an awful
lot of them, and by the way am an ardent Celtophile, though mainly a fan of
the Gaelic branch.  I know that Ireland (and Scotland) at least, were in no
significant way matriachal as opposed to matrilineal.  Also, the Gauls
(most, though certainly not all of the rest of the Celts) were apparently
patriarchal, at least according to Roman sources (Livy, Arrian, Caeser,
etc.).  Finally, having female priestesses was fairly common in ancient
societies- even the decidedly patriarchial Romans had the Vestal Virgins.
And I agree, "the Goddess" doesn\'t come up much in any of the epics I\'ve
read- though, like most pantheons, Birgitte and other female deities do pop
up quite a bit.

you look at the diagrams of the foot (in AM2 inside front cover lower

Actually, the early European concept of a house, or at least its roof,
is based on an overturned boat:  sloped roof, roof rafters.  

Moebius did a beautiful comic in which a huge, ancient, crashed
spaceship was the center of a city.

Finally, see Larry Niven, A Gift From Earth, for use of a colony ship as
the first structure on the colony.

I\'m reminded of a conversation I had with Les Howie some years ago, when
we both noted that our Traveller universes had a Catholic Church and a
Jewish religion.

My understanding of the Jewish perspective on this problem is as
follows:  What\'s most important is the life of the people.  If something
has to be done so that people can live, even if that thing is contrary
to Jewish laws, then it must be done and it is not considered a crime or
violation of law.  So if people are off the earth, then they have to
eat, and they have to eat what\'s available.  So what\'s available is not
considered unclean and may be eaten.  

Is there a Talmudic scholar in the TML who can help us out?

Legal documents won\'t be paper any more after some tech level, probably
TL 9 or 10.  They\'ll be in electronic form, with encryption to verify
that it is what it seems to be.  The encryption will be decodable by
governments who share the code with each other.  Sure, there will be
problems with forgery, but there are always problems with forgery.  So,
basically, you\'ll have a card with data units for each important
document.  You may well have more than one copy -- one at home, one in a
safe deposit box, one with you when you travel, one aboard your ship. 
Why not?

evidence they\'re even alive, let alone working on the project, one get\'s a
little worried.

You\'ve raised the question of conflict of laws.  There\'s no easy answer
to this question -- in fact, in law school I took a semester-long class
on this subject (well, in American jurisprudence, not Imperial, but I
would expect Imperial jurisprudence to be much more complex)  -- because
it depends on the specific laws of Worlds A and B.  E.g., does A
recognize any marriages of B?  

Important points to remember in this analysis are: (1) an Imperial
member world\'s laws only apply on the world; (2) subject to certain
exceptions, anyone on a world must obey its laws; and (3) there is no
"full faith and credit" between Imperial member worlds.  (Caveat:  This
is my analysis, applicable to my Traveller universe, and not addressed
anywhere in canon so far as I know.)

Canon doesn\'t address this either, so far as I know.  In my Traveller
universe, anyone who is a citizen of a member world is also a citizen of
the Imperium.  Each member world determines citizenship according to its
own laws.  Some worlds will not allow renunciation of citizenship, but
most will.  On the other hand, most people have to live somewhere and
that place may make them citizens.  

Being a worldless citizen of the Imperium is of course a tax dodge. 
Because the Imperium only taxes member states and not sophonts, one can
seek to escape taxation by not being a citizen of any member state.  Of
course, non-citizen residents are subject to taxation where they live,
and may well pay a higher rate than citizens.
