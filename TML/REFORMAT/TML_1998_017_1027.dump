    'body' => '1)  I\'d like more of a combo of choice and chance as in TNE.  Rolls for
special adventures/duty, promotion (though this needs to be worked on more
realistically), commissions (again, more realistically), etc.  I liked the
brownie points in MT.  Also the court martial, etc.  Ties in nicely w/ the
Prisoner and Corsair careers in TNE.  I think there should be more civilian
occupations as TNE, as well.  Most importantly, a variable term length would
be appropriate.  

I\'ve worked up a combo of the TNE and MT generations (weighed more on
TNE/choice than MT/random) for Reformation Coalition Navy and Marine Corps
characters.  I\'ve been meaning to expand the system (especially for Coalition
member-world forces), but It meshes very nicely w/ the Medals of the
Reformation Coalition by Franklin Cain (i think).

2) TNE personal combat is quite lethal, despite the rumors, as quite a few of
my players well know.  This should be tied in w/ effects to attributes but
i\'ve never much liked the "life force" thing in MT.

3) Of course, I think d20 gives a far better curve and the d20 "GDW House"
system is quite simple and easy to use, but I don\'t think it\'s a bright
prospect. : (

4)  TNE personal combat is well done and layered but could possible be
organized a little better, especially for novices.  A "modular" approach of
complexity would be nice.

5)  I\'m all for a system of "module" ship construction as in G:T.  Not having
ever used QSDS, isn\'t this much the same?  A detailed system is definately a
must, though.  A simpler system can and should probably be arranged for the
less gearhead-inclined amongst us, though.

I rather prefer the Battle Rider style of presenting compact ship designs for
simplicity and BL style for "full specs."  

6)  If the rules are going to be "Milieu" specific, it should be made sure
recycled equipment lists aren\'t used (especially of the higher tech than the
Milieu supports).
Best bet is have the design system done and predesign equipment to put in.
Make sure all ships, weapons, and vehicles have been done and are legal and
consistent w/ teh design system.  This is a must if there is to be a design
system, at all.

7)  I really liked how the mapless/abstract system of ship combat in the TNE
main book is practically seamless w/ Brilliant Lances (which fits pretty good
w/ Battle Rider itself).  This is a must.  Include the mapless/abstract w/ the
rules and have a boxed game for tactical later.  IMO, just reprint Brilliant
Lances and/or Battle Rider (or better yet a mesh of the two.  I, for example,
use BL for PCs only and BR for NPC ships).

I also have a strong opinion that the ship combat system shouldn\'t be designed
from the top down.  As in having certain "right way" to win.  I\'d prefer a
skill oriented space combat over something statistically oriented.  

Lastly... bring back 1/10 of a light second range band/hexes!!!

8) Only npc alien templates are probably appropriate for the main rule book.
PC probably can\'t be covered effectively... maybe one or two, if the main book
is going to be Milieu specific.  Otherwise stick to npc profiles/descriptions,
if that.

9) A general timeline of Imperial Space (appropriate to the Milieu), along w/
maybe a 2 page summary (also done nicely IMO in TNE).  Leave the Ancients
stuff off, aside from teh general theory of human transplantation.  Maybe it
can be reintroduced as a mystery to new players.  Some sample space is a
must... at *least* 2 subsectors... 1 fringe and 1 mature for comparison.  Most
of the setting is more appropriate in another book, I think, though. (IISS
UWP) World Building should definately be included.  The key is to use the
setting as an aid and attraction and not as a crutch that will scare off new
players.

10)  If at all, especially if the first nine points have been met, make it as
flashy as possible.  Something that can actually compete w/ ST:TNG and SW:
Revised & Expanded and teh Babylon Project...  these will be the competitors
of Traveller.  GDW always matched what TSR was putting out (they were just
getting into the flashy stuff IIRC).

Strangest thing, we have discussed just this issue in the Hero Mirc Chat.
Seems like most of the older gamers prefer to see Background as opposed to
mechanics.
I think we all have the CGen/mechanics we prefer, but good background is the
draw.
That is the whole reason I ordered GT.
Not because I want Gurps, but because I lost all my CT in a flood and want a
copy of the background again (I miss the LBB)

That would work for containers designed only for orbital use, at the cost
of making them more specialized (no low tech planets or class D or E
ports).  I\'m sure you could build collapsible containers that were
streamlined when assembled, but I\'m not sure the extra expense would
justify it.

There is an international standardized container that is designed to come
apart into its flat sides and transport in a stack, but I can\'t find the
designation right offhand.

Depends on the size of the containers.  A LASH freighter designed for
800dton lighters could just as easily carry 800dton barges, although they
would have to be more lightly loaded (~3 stons/dton, rather than the usual
5).  I was looking into a freight tender for 30dton cutter modules, and I
don\'t think I can legitimately substitute 26 modules for one lighter on a
LASH design.

 No a valid argument.  You might as well say the sun is
 invunerable/indistructable simply because it is to massive to be affected by
 the weapon we can put against it.  It\'s a question of scale.  The guns
 mounted on the iron clads were intended to defeat wooden ships not iron
 clads and the inclads were so overweighted that they sank in a moderate
storm!

 That was never tested.  Neither iron clad sank of was sunk by a wooden ship.
 At least that is as I recall it from high school history.  A very long time
ago.

Actually the 15" Dalghrens could penetrate 5" iron with 2\' oak backing, when
loaded with solid shot. The Tennessee was riddled at Mobile Bay (there were
penetrations, and massive casualties from non penetrating hits causing bolts
to pop off and from wood splinters). This TERRIFIED the British and French, as
their ironclads were armored about the same way. They RAPIDLY developed
thicker armor, and then bigger guns. Nothing is inpenetrable or
unsinkable....:-)

My understanding of the Special category was that it was deliberately undefined so GMs could add their own fun things to Psionics or to better model the universe for the background they preferred.  Computer empathy is one that is referred to in later CT material IIRC, so is not entirely non-cannon.  I definately wouldn\'t consider this heretical (possibley non-standard however).

  Uh. Zhodani Module, page 3:
  "Zhdant has a population of 83 million, of whom more than 90% are racial
Zhodani. Significant non-Zhodani population is primarily Addaxur."


  When I did Tienspevnekr sector for HIWG five years ago (The Tienspevnekr
writeup on the HIWG CD is mine), that line led to my placing Addaxur
worlds and populations all over the sector. I KNOW where all of the
original Addaxur worlds are, and where the "reservation" is now...

...but I still don\'t know what they look like. I was sort of aiming
at a multi-legged reptiloid hyena, but the concept faded. I maintain
that the vast majority are low-slung and positively cheerful.
"Happy carnivores."

 The Addaxur were the Zhodani\'s first real First Contact situation. The
Zho passed the test with flying colors for two reasons: they and the
Addaxur really are compatible, and the Zhodani spent years watching the
Addaxur before speaking to them. This set of techniques works sometimes,
and has utterly failed at others (thus generating library data, hee hee)

 The Addaxur Reservation is a true sovereign state by ancient pact and
tradition. "Reservation" does not carry the same stigma that is attached
to what we Yanks did/are doing/will do to the American Indians. Many of
the worlds of the old Addaxur "Empire" still have Addaxur on them. The
Zhodani did not deport them 5000 years ago, and have not discouraged
Addaxur immigrants since then.

Here I have to agree. Now I don\'t like GURPS and I think there are aspects of 
G:T which don\'t reproduce Traveller well. I even think the omission of a basic 
world gen system OR a predesigned subsector (Regina would be my pick) in 
G:T is a problem. However I think that this problem is easily fixed. The first 
solution that springs to mind is to simply put a link on the G:T webpage to Jim 
Vassilakos Gal 2.4 (or better yet mirror it on their own FTP site). This along 
with the conversion rules in G:T would provide a new ref with more than enough 
info to start a game. I do however really hope that G:T is a huge success since 
its likely to create a market for T5 and the books are excellant source material 
for any version of Traveller. I don\'t like the TNE system, but it doesn\'t stop me 
from plundering the sourcebooks ruthelessly for my own use.

Nope, I\'m looking at what you need to get started; and you need either a 
pregenerated play area or a world gen system. Either would do, as it stands 
G:T has neither.

No you\'ve misread what I wrote. I took what I think would be the minium 
required to "properly" run G:T and T4 (I never mentioned the LBB). For G:T I felt 
that 3 books were required (one basic rules, one backgroun, one to fill out a 
minor omission), for T4 I felt two were required (rules and background). I then 
went on to suggest simple and easy solutions to the omission of a world gen 
system. You need worlds to play the game, the info is all available free in Gal 
2.4 and I then suggested that the simplest solution to this perceived problem 
would be a link on the G:T webpage to Gal 2.4.

That might be like using a 5in battleship gun against a torpedo or missile -- possible but problematical (not to mention overkill).  I don\'t see any problem with aiming (especially since we are assuming targeting computers that are reasonably good to get several hex precision shots).  I do think there may be questions about speed of aiming against something with some agility that may be only a couple of thousand km away instead of tens of thousands of km away.  The analogy I think of (even though it is a
different universe) is the Death Star in Star Wars where they couldn\'t catch the fighters with the main guns because they had too much agility and were too close.  The weapons were designed for a different set of circumstances (though they did manage to catch some of the fighters).

The Traveller Links page at the GT website is:

It includes a link to the Traveller webring and ends with the offer:

SOB! I understand _exactly_ how you feel, my COMPLETE collection
(Everything of GDWs, most of DGP, some Judge\'s Guild, some Gamelords,
some FASA) of CT and MT were destroyed in a flood.

Over the years I have spent _tons_ of money trying to rebuild my
collection. I\'m nearly finished...all I have left are the hard to find
rare items (Early JTAS, Early Trav Digests, Atlas of the Imperium, Grand
Survey, World builders Handbook, 101 Robots, FASA stuff...).

I wish you the best of luck rebuilding your own collection. I know how
hard it is.

have the other GURPS books mentioned anyway. Others may buy it to mine for

buy no other books anyway!

GURPS Traveller is a port of the Traveller background to the GURPS rules
system, with that background altered to a "no-Rebellion" alternate world
for those who never cared for that background and likely to avoid competing
with the "real" Traveller timeline. Because some of us might PREFER GURPS
Traveller to the "real" Traveller both for system and background reasons is
no reason to get upset over. Some believe that this version will "replace"
the "original" timeline. I think this idea will last just long enough for
T5 to come out, and then will be forgotten. But I am not a prophet...only
one person knows, and that\'s Marc. And he will comment if he chooses to.

This is my final comment on the whole thing. I play what I like, you play
what you like. More power to both of us.

  I see your point; however, it is useful to point out that the correct
comparison
is to GURPS basic (rules for _lots_ of stuff, no background) versus the original
LBB\'s. Thus, G:T is the equivalent of the background Supplements,

  Ignoring net stuff, I\'m sure I could get by with G:T, BTC, and either Lite
or (preferably) Basic. If I wanted to I\'d fly with G:T and Lite only - what\'s
the costing on G:T, anyway?

  As for newbies? Most GURPS players already have most of the items they want
except for G:T itself - and we have to acknowledge that SJG at least wants to
sell (good, or great if possible) product. Anyone new to GURPS is facing the

  The Monitor was designed only to have turret guns - _very large ones_; this

AFAIK CSS Virginia had a normal load-out; I lack proper operational details

  Your original thesis was that (IIRC) these situations don\'t occur; you
are, IMO, largely correct overall, although in the details there are quite
substantial temporary anomalies. Neither "theory" addresses the fact that
solutions need to be in the same ballpark of technological capability to be
practical.

  <giggle> Wrong universe :)  There are no matter teleporter/replicators in

as Ancient artifacts (what does TL 45 do is perhaps less relevant than what
_doesn\'t_ it do).

Good pick, but they are fixed now (aren\'t they?)...The problem of designing
large vessels is a real problem  without FF&S1/2  How about extending
either of the above to include large ships, generating BR stats, for which
less detail ought to be required.  has it already been done?

Recommends is a more reasonable assessment.  Heck, players got along for 
years without a Compendium.  And while there were some advantages and 
disads that appeared in every supplement for a while (Contacts, Secret), 
those were added in the 3rd Edition Revised Basic Rulebook.  The 
Compendiums were designed to save people money -- so that you didn\'t have 
to have 20+ books (half of which were out of print) to have all the rules 
you might want to have.

Seriously, you could easily run a game with GURPS Basic, GURPS Space and 
GURPS Traveller.  Behind the Claw could be substituted for GURPS Space -- 
you either need sample worlds or World Generation rules -- not both.  If 
you didn\'t a lot of ads and disads, you could get away with GURPS lite -- 
this could be considered to be pretty close to classic Traveller, which 
didn\'t have ads or disads at all.

Vehicles would only be required for ex-Striker die hards (me! me!) who 
liked tinkering with vehicle designs.  The math is geeky enough that I 
wouldn\'t ever recommend it as a required book.  (Understand that I\'m not 
knocking it at all -- it is an awesome book -- but some of my friends 
aren\'t engineers).

Ultra-techs are not as useful for GURPS Traveller because a lot of the 
gadgets are higher tech than a typical traveller game.  A fair number of 
useful gadgets, but not really required for play.  G:T has a pretty 
complete set of weapons and armor already.

GURPS Space is probably a requirement if you want a lot of detail on 
space campaigns -- but having said that, GURPS Space is a damn good book 
and anyone running SF should probably own a copy. :D

Let\'s see, the little black books didn\'t have any background at all.  So 
you obviously couldn\'t run something in the Traveller background without 
adding a bunch of stuff:

Supplement 3 or Supplement 10 or Spinward Marches Campaign
Library Data A-M, N-Z
Striker (since you wanted GURPS Vehicles on the required list).
Numerous adventures to get bits and pieces of the background and history.
Mercenary and High Guard (more advanced weapons and ships found in G:T)
JTAS back issues (for sparse backgrounds on some of the alien races, 
which is all the core G:T rulebook provides).

The original 3 rulebooks were nice, but they were almost completely 
rules.  If you wanted that, you could get by with GURPS Space and GURPS 
Lite -- and actually have *more* advice on running different types of SF 
campaigns than you\'d find in the original Traveller rulebook.  Heck, 
you\'d actually have stuff on alien races!  I\'m not knocking the original 
Traveller rules -- I grew up on them too.  But the background didn\'t come 
until later.  And looking at BTC and G:T, most of the content is pure 
background.

If you wanted to run GURPS:Traveller and have gobs of choices, rules, 
etc,  I\'d say you would not need more than:

GURPS Basic (3rd revised)
GURPS Space
GURPS Traveller
Behind the Claw

Maybe $80-$90 bucks, but you are getting a lot of bang for that buck. 
GURPS Space isn\'t a requirement but has many interesting rules (where 
were real rules for heavy-G worlds in the LBBs?) as well as tons of 
different campaign ideas. And probably isn\'t required if you\'ve got 
Behind the Claw, because you don\'t need rules for generating new 
planetary systems.

If you wanted to run Traveller on a budget, you could probably get away 
with GURPS Traveller and Behind the Claw, using GURPS Lite as your core 
rules.  Might be a little light on the skills list, but so were books 
1-3.  The only thing you\'d really lack with the budget version would be 
Psionics rules.


Something else to keep in mind -- printing costs are much higher than 
they were 20 years ago.  Paper costs a lot more.  I bet you\'d have a hard 
time selling one of the LBBs for less than about $10-12 bucks, which 
would make the "minimum set" more expensive than the 4 GURPS books.  I 
seem to recall that Steve Jackson stopped selling the 32 page adventures 
because it was impossible to make any money off of them.  128 page books 
became the minimum to actually make money.

  Ah, problem. As a Striker splinter of the CT cult, I must strive for

in a high ROF/high accuracy beam environment is a sin, as the firing
solutions can be clearly demonstrated to make such munitions unworkable.

  I\'m sure that the Imperiums representatives can think of various reasons
to make their locales more exciting, but the economic growth attributed to
warfare is a particularly naughty and inaccurate overgeneralization - you
could just as well build pyramids (or throw shells, aircraft and tanks into
the ocean if it amused you) as long as you can command the resources and get
everyone to go along with any reductions in their living standard (or numbers
:> ) that might be involved.

that Ocean going ironclads were more vulnerable to each other than monitor

you see the tradition of the 1860\'s monitor carried on in two directions,

defence Battleships of the Siamese, and Swedish navies.

  This is one of the best schemes I\'ve heard yet, but getting _dozens_
of strategic warfare devices is going to be _really_ tough: IMTU, about
once in a generation if it went down. The 3I uses heavy cruisers to ship
_table wine_, for Cthulhu\'s sake! (fleet couriers work about as well, IMO).
One shudders to think what the local fleet maneuvers cycle would be like
until NI was certain that the case was closed...

  A patrol ship that has info that clashes with such a vessels faked

  Quite possible, but only if INI or whoever won the war for implementation
is fairly incompetent; any normal power-hungry bureaucracy will turn this
into their own feudal preserve even before any hyper-patriotic (and paranoid)
spooks get involved.

  There\'s absolutely no need (unless you want to make security more porous)
for these units to be un-imprinted anywhere but in transit, at Naval facilities,
and at major ports - with pre-arranged registration a fully imprinted box
could arrive ready for hook-up at a smaller A port (why the heck they would
need to be stored at ports that can\'t build starships escapes me).

  The above speech, although eloquent, may not be at all relevant to the
official mind of the Third Imperium. Neither the secrecy nor privacy of its\'
inhabitants lives is an inherently good thing for the 3I, and may in fact be
a provably bad thing, from their POV. The only freedom that the 3I cares
about is its\' own freedom of action - the freedom of its\' citizens doesn\'t
appear to be a great concern - nor their safety or even survival, so long as
they expire in a discreet and not too destructive fashion.

  Naval Intelligence most certainly does want perfect information, but they
also insist that _no one else have it_ :>  If their own ops keep getting
flagged (or ImperialLines TJ\'s) it merely proves that the system is working.

  It\'s not original to point out that in a world where almost nothing can be
concealed from the few, a very great deal may yet be concealed from the masses.
(hmm, there\'s a basis for an anti-Zho rant there...)

  As long as it\'s not warships being tracked all essential strategic data is
already available to foreign governments. Even without the SDG boxes you\'d
still have starport (and other vessel/facility) traffic logs, and it requires
a certain type of intent to believe that that information will not (or can\'t!)
be collated. Ultimately, the effect is little different from flying over from
Asia, travelling from coast to coast by car, and spending a week in a city at
each end; if you do it all on plastic what can be learned about you in fairly
short order? In a month?

  Internally, the Imperium really only wants to keep an eye on very
influential political incorrigibles, and starships. They don\'t need to worry
about checking
the phone company records, grocery bills, and bank balances of their average
drone "citizen", _so long as they keep their eyes on the balls that matter_.

  OTOH, if the 3I really is dumb as rocks then we can only assume that the
Templars or Cthulhu Itself are keeping them safe from the nefarious claws
of Sol-Sec. :>

The were never covered in terms of a Contact-like
article, but they had a long write-up in one of
the Library Data books. Since you might have trouble
finding those, look in GURPS Traveller, pp.73-74.
It\'s pretty much the same information.

Any number of critters from various worlds.

In one MT "interview," the subject travelled with
a geneered dog, which among other things was 
more intelligent than regular breeds. This let it
follow more complicated commands, but it wasn\'t
sophont-level intelligence.

When they were on the ball, they planned for that 
contingency. When they weren\'t .... anything from
geese honking (loudly) to Ravenous Bug-Bladder Beasts
of Traal welcomed them.

Shame about Charisma, but basically I quite liked the T4 system.

Good to hear. I have always liked the way Trav dealt with hits by reducing stats.
Personally I always applied the stat mods immediately i.e. if your stats go down
below the bonus level you lose the bonus. From memory T4 said that any stat bonuses
were retained regardless of hits.

I\'ve never used interrupts and can\'t quite see the point of them. Ordinary initiative
seems to have worked out OK IMTU.

QSDS was something I really liked in T4. It gave the feeling of a bit more detail
than books 2 or 5 without going into FF&S. IMHO it\'d be nice to bring back
multi-weapon turrets and a hardpoint limit.One other thing is that the ships included
in the basic book need to be able to be duplicated using the included rules.

Nice. Kind of like Emporer\'s Arsenal / Vehicles? Those books redeemed T4 in my eyes.
Nice clear info with nice art.

I look forward to seeing T5.

Fine. At least you admit it *IS* "user UNFRIENDLY".

Like I said, there are lots of people on this list who are gearheads to the nth
degree. Great. Is this list representative of the wider gaming public? Are they
even a majority *on* this list?

Sales of FF&S (or GV2, for that matter) don\'t even give a clue. *I* have FF&S
(#1, not #2 ... couldn\'t see the point) and have both GV1 and GV2 ... I also
have CORPS VDS. I\'ve tried all of them ... *all* of them ... and the only ones
that were of any use to me *AS A VEHICLE DESIGN SYSTEM* were GV1 and VDS.

The others were useless.

Sure, if they had provided a spreadsheet *ALREADY WRITTEN* to allow you to plug
and play with the figure, I would have (and still would) feel differently. They
didn\'t.

Why did I buy these books, then?

For the same reason I buy a lot of stuff, there\'s *something* in it that might
be of use. The vehicle systems weren\'t much, but the background they implied, no
matter how broken the rest of the stuff was, was usable, and almost worth the
price (hey, I don\'t smoke, I\'m a teetotaller, so what other vices can I spend my
money on ;-)

Sales do not *necessarily* indicate that many people use them to design
vehicles. Nor does possible gearhead majority on this list. Both are quite
possibly atypical.

Not exactly... that NORMALLY speeds up TNE play however
UPP: A77558-5-5
Skill		Easy	Avg	Diff	Form	Imp
Piloting-2	28	14	7	4	2
Admin-4		36	18	9	5	2

Is easier for some players. The problem comes when these types use a hand
comp with the right program for a +1 to base asset (difficult collumn),
resulting in the following rolls

Pilot-2 + comp	32	16	8	4	2
Admin-4 + comp	40	20	10	5	3

more extreme example could be applied, but I found that TNE really slowed
down most players in my group, save peter. Including myself.

In MT, we just pre-calced all the att DM\'s, and recalced post-combat for
injured dm\'s, as per MT rules.

IMTU, there is a typeical "Ship-cat", ranging from 10-40 kilos, derived
from the NorthAmerican Bobcat. Geneered for higher intelligence (although
not a full uplift), tollerance for 0-G, and the ability to get really harsh
when "friends" are threatened. Retractable claws and carpeted ships make
for good 0 or low G traction, plus claws and teeth. Figure out stats for
your favorite edition... it is a carnivore-pouncer. Typically, these
critters are about as intelligent as beaker moneys or most primates, and
bred for both intellect and trainability. Attack training (on command &//or
when owner is held at weapon point) is common, as is poison proofing (will
only eat from ONE dish, and only if that dish is in the right location.
Usually needs a decent litterbox, but can be trained to use a standard
fresher (formidable, animal handling, takes several (2d6) weeks of doing
nothing else and about cr50 in training aids, which it gets weaned off of.

Typical coloring runs gold, beige, dun, grey, brown, or mottled. Tail is
stumpy and useless. Cost runs Cr50-500 for kittens, though KCr5-20 for
adults with som training, dependant upon lineage, papers, and training.
Found in and near the solomani rim, but sometimes seen as far away as the
domain of deneb.

If allowed, a mother trained to use a fresher will teach her kittens the same.

Typically, they are given run of the crew spaces (except SR\'s) other than
passenger areas. Access to doors to passenger areas is one-way: out of them.

They require about an hour of attention a day minimum... and tend to be
fairly loyal.

I\'m a rational cynic, not a conspiracy theorist. At least not in traveller.
The Imperium really isn\'t going to give a whit more than it has to to
insure it\'s economic base... even if it really is a Makhidkarun or
Sharushiid plot.

IMTU, there ARE conspiracies... of mortal men. There are conspiratorial
organizations, like the Order of the Golden Dawn, the Church of Universal
Harmony, the Church of the Chosen one, the entire Hiver race.... But I
don\'t think there is any one cabal of illuminati in control... there are
too many wonderful, low end conspiracies for that.... Now, report for
indoctrination into  the Imperial Sub-ministry of Internal Administrative
Security for re-programing, and ask for Dr. M. Bender, who will help you
understand. ;-)

Just for reference, I don\'t run CORPS 1st Ed nor G:Illuminati since they
remind me too much of real life....

I see the Vehicle design systems as Compilers in the computer biz. Most
people wont need or use a compiler, they\'re happy with Excel, Word etc but
software developers need the compilers to make the Excel and Word users
happy, the same with design systems. If there isn\'t any design system most
made up vehicles would be useless as each designers tech concept would vary
wildly, with GV2 for instance I can join the GURPS mailing list and get a
complete design every day or so that is consistent with the gaming
universe.

Some refs/players of Traveller may not need FF&S but the fact that it is
there might give those players ready made designs.

I have GV2, VDS, High Guard 1ed & 2ed, Striker I, FF&S 1 & 2 but I don\'t
use them as I got my own design system that works well for me. I wouldn\'t
say that buying those books was a waste of my money as they\'ve given me
hints on how to do my own design system and rules about vehicles. I
especially encourage Refs to buy GV2 for the Vehicle action rules, great
stuff wether one uses GURPS or not.

Warfare stimulate certain sections of the economy, and for the winner, they
tend to slowly crawl down, based upon historical evidence currently known;
losers either suddenly drop or build up post-war). Mostly, large
military-industrial complexes. Also, warfare has the side benefits of
population control, and keeping a well honed base to draw the Imperial Army
from. Additionally, it keeps them busy enough distrusting each other that
they don\'t bother to look at rebelling from tthe Imperium... for they know
that if the other side cheats too often, the ImpMil response will eliminate
them.

I will honestly admit that it seldom does much for standards of living, but
it does wonders for tech development. And tech development spins off. Were
it not for WWII, electronic computing probably would not have advanced as
fast as it did between 1940 and 1960. The drive for a faster code-cracker
was boosted even more with the rise of the cold war in the 50\'s, but has
it\'s origins in the code-cracking of WWII.

Similarly, cold war and low-level hostilities in "buffers" are the best way
to test new weapons systems, which tends to drag along the supporting
technology. Take for example, the humble Catapillar Bulldozer, which uses a
continuous track motive system, which was perfected primarily for tanks,
from early models for farm tractors. Development that probably would not
have been nearly as fast as without the war (WWI).

And of course, the Radar, which keeps Millions much safer in the air. A
wartime development. Which has since spun of into Microwave overs,
Astronomy, Cell Phones, etc.

Medicine also benefits from warfare, and (altho the AMA doesn\'t like to
admit it) from wartime atrocities. Much of the modern knowledge of exposure
to cold and to deprivations is based upon captured NAZI deathcamp
experimental data. A lot can be learned about how to save lives by learning
just exactly the most efficient ways to kill. Penicillan was a wartime
development. Modern trauma techniques are based upon WWII and Korean era
MASH techniques, refined again in Vietnam. Poison and Disease
control/treatment is much advanced based upon potential as weapons... the
soviets killed many of their own in exposures during training for CBR
warfare with live chem agent, then did detailed autopsies to figure out
exactly what the toxins did. And got a good bit more from using chem
warfare in afganistan.

Most historical technological progress is centered around warfare
technology and its spinoffs. To paraphrase sir B.H. Liddel-Hart, Societies
grow during peacetime, tech during conflict.

Or just use the Jack of All Trades Skill Enhancer (though this is much less
powerful than JOT in Traveller). It costs 3 points and reduces the cost of
all professional skills by 1.

While the latter was true of the Monitor and the Merrimak (IIRC the Monitor
did sink while at sea in mild weather), it was not true of the first
ironclads built by the French and English (the Glorie (sp?) and the
Warrior). HMS Warrior was considered to be somewhat clumsy under sail by
the standards of the time because while she had the sail area of a frigate
she had the displacement of a ship of the line because of her armour,
however she was not considered unseaworthy, and was in fact quite steady
because of her large displacement and deep draught. Some of the later ships
were somewhat less sea worthy than their wooden predecessors, but this was
more because of the introduction of steam and turrets than it was from the
armour e.g. HMS Captain sank because of her low freeboard and the poor
sailing characterisitcs that came from her casemates (although IIRC the
Board of Inquiry found her captain to be at fault, as much as her design).

Also note that while early ironclads often were nearly immune to their own
guns this only lasted for a short while, and that it was always possible to
ram your opponent. The Monitor and the Merrimak were both (compared to
European ironclads) undergunned makeshifts. IMO it would be fiar to say
that neither would have lasted very long against, say, HMS Warrior.

BTW the biggest advantages fort guns had were the stable firing platform
giving better range, and being able to fire red-hot shot - which became
increasingly irrelevant as ironclads became more and more common.

The funny thing is that the ironclads were in part an attempt to return to
\'the old days\' where ships were, in fact, very nearly immune to gunfire.
The old wooden ships of the line used to take pretty much all day to pound
another ship to the point where you could board it, and this was usually
after both sides had decided to fight. One of the reasons Admirals who
managed to catch an outnumbered enemy and destroy or capture them were so
highly thought of was because forcing an opponent into a fight against his
will was damned difficult.

Just to throw some fat on the fire I\'d like to point out that Deluxe TNE

No, seriously, I have a question for the more scientifically endowed on 
the
list. I got a TNS message today that read (in part):

"The gas-giant planet Plistii, in the Lunion subsector of the Spinward
Marches, underwent a violent shudder beginning on 341-1115, causing some
small concern for the inhabitants of Quiru, one of Plistii\'s satellites
(Quiru/Lunion 2321)."

Why would this cause some any concern at all for the inhabitants of 
Quiru?

Ciao,

My guess would be, if something has started a pressure wave bouncing 
about in the GG\'s atmosphere, and is sufficient to start its\' center of 
gravity wobbling at near resonant frequency, the moons orbits would also 
start wobbling.  If sufficient, seems that you could tear a planet apart 
this way.  (Shades of Ancient tech here).  I know, its a handwave, but 
hey, I\'m the GM, I got lots \'o hands.  =)

	Even worse, Coke Classic is NOT "Coca Cola" as it existed prior to

Thanks for the suggestion. However, the race has already been designed
(the book is 98% written as of now, and is just in its final stages).

Fortunately, they are not centuaroid, are indeed bipeds, and do indeed
have four arms with two high ST lower arms and two high dexterity
upper arms...

They are not full citizens of the Zhodani Consulate, but do travel outside
their reservation extensively through it, and can be found operating
merchant vessels, trading with border areas, and settling in enclaves on
various Zhodani worlds. Sharp-eyed readers of the original Alien Module 4:
Zhodani may note that Zhdant\'s population is "90% racial Zhodani ...

Unless they have only one eye, it\'s unlikely.

The aliens lizards the Drak Ne\' Vha, an expansionist minor race located
between Vargr and Zhodani space. The Drakarans (as Imperial humans tend to
call them) were unusual in reaching late TL10 and colonizing much of their
solar system without developing jump drive. Some Vargr traders happened by
at the wrong moment (around 1050, soon after an interplanetary war had
finished winding down) and were captured. Certain misunderstandings
(mainly of the role of Vargr corsairs) resulted in conflict, and a
Drakaran explosion into Vargr territory whose shockwaves are only
beginning to be felt to rimward as of 1120. The Drak Ne Vha tend not to be
agressive in, say, an Aslan sense, but do have an alien mindset to the
Vargr which tends not to be conducive to peaceful coexistence with them.
The Zhodani Consulate is trying to sort the mess out through diplomacy.

Yeah, HG\'s system level detail is really what most need most of the

the low detail approach.  The important stuff gets FFS2.  It all depends 
on the situation.  BTW, Keven, I found some T4 to HG conversion stuff, 
so I\'ll start doing dual descriptions on my ships from now on.

It gets worse than that...

Corn syrup is only "much cheaper" because of the power of sugar
industry lobbyists. The price of sugar is artificially inflated through
the roof - the corn syrup industry wouldn\'t even exist if sugar prices
weren\'t so high.

A nice side effect has been the slow destruction of the American
sugar industry - production in Hawaii alone has slipped from over
a million tons a year (in 1987, and for decades before that) to less
than 400,000 tons/year. The lobbyists managed to work themselves
out of a job - the Hawaii Sugar Planter\'s Association (a major lobbyist
group) closed their Washington offices a year or two ago.

As Coca-Cola moves into the Corn-Syrup Industry\'s camp, the
power of the Corn Barons continues to grow at the expense of
the Sugar Planters..... <g>

SOB! I understand _exactly_ how you feel, my COMPLETE collection
(Everything of GDWs, most of DGP, some Judge\'s Guild, some Gamelords,
some FASA) of CT and MT were destroyed in a flood.

Over the years I have spent _tons_ of money trying to rebuild my
collection. I\'m nearly finished...all I have left are the hard to find
rare items (Early JTAS, Early Trav Digests, Atlas of the Imperium, Grand
Survey, World builders Handbook, 101 Robots, FASA stuff...).

I wish you the best of luck rebuilding your own collection. I know how
hard it is.

=============

Yep, I lost most of my old CT, along with a LARGE collection of 
wargames, and a nearly complete set of SFB (and you SFB players out 
there know, thats no small pile of stuff) in a fire.  It\'ll never be 
again I fear.

That might be like using a 5in battleship gun against a torpedo or

The USN\'s newer 5 inch guns are autoloaded, and capable of a relatively 
high ROF, and rigged to fire controllers that allow them to be used for 
surface or air targets, supposedly including missiles.  Anyone out there

Yes they can break _a_ key. What happens when they\'re intercepting thousands

So, in theory, can a 1000 node Beowulf system, costing about a tenth or less,
but that is beside the point. The system that the NSA needs a gazillion dollar
system to break PGP in \'hundreds of hours\' pales beside the $100 or less
required to buy a system to efficiently encrypt messages using that long key
PGP cipher.

The other side to the PGP equation is not only use encryption, but use it
widely. If there are millions of encrypted messages in the stream, how do you
decide which to spend the hundreds of hours breaking? 


> There are no unbeatable systems.  To say there are is to say that perfection
> exists.  

AKAIK, NO one has said that PGP (or any system) is perfect...just hard to
break on a routine basis. Any lock can be picked, any alarm can be
circumvented, any ecryption scheme can be broken. The whole point is: can it
be done in time to provide timely intel...rushing into the smoking hulk of
your headquarters clutching a sheet of paper yelling "I got it! Their message
said they are going to bomb us, uhhh...yesterday!" does little good.

The whole point is, right now, it is far harder to break encryption schemes
than to create new ones. Since this has been true for as long as we have
records, it is rerasonable to assume this will be the state long into the
future. TL-16 encryption will be extremely hard to defeat, probably impossible
to do so in a real-time manner, precicely because the increase in computing
power necessary to break these systems is readily turned around to make
stronger encryption.

So, no it is not a matter of belief or \'not listening to reason\'

There\'s a difference between the Authorities being able to get that information
at the cost of considerable trouble and expense and being able to routinely
get it for free. Remember in the pirate debate, it was argued that collating
this information might cost several hundred thousand credits, but that a
stolen ship is valuable enough to make it worth while to take the trouble.

I can well imagine an Imperium that would have this level of control, but I
don\'t want to set my adventures in it. Nor do I think that the Imperium of
the OTU is that Imperium (Don\'t ask me to provide proof of that; it is just
my feeling).

The evidence of incongruities I\'ve found is the reason why I don\'t like them

You must get most of your excersise from jumping to conclusions. I\'ve never
said that I don\'t like TNE. I spent a lot of effort on the Pocket Empire
mailing list working on a TNE campaign background (and had a lot of fun
doing it). What I don\'t like are inconsistencies. And I\'m not too fond of
people who introduce new elements that are inconsistent with previously
published material and then insist that the NEW stuff should be considered
superior to the old one merely because it is new. My attitude to new stuff
is that it is the obligation of the author of such to make sure that it is
"backward compatible" (Unless the old stuff was flawed to begin with, of
course).

You can do that IYTU bacause it is yours and no one disputes your right to
do anything you damn well please in your own personal TU. That\'s not in
dispute. What we are discussing (well... what I am discussing, anyway) is
what we, each of us personally, think that future authors of official
Traveller material _ought_ to regard as canon.

Starts in 1105, runs over two years or so. The trade war is close to the end
of the campaign. 1107ish.

Can you? That would involve regarding one of the statements in _Survival
Margin_ as untrue, and the moment you do that, you lose whatever moral
advantage you may have from insisting that _Survival Margin_ is the gospel
truth. If you are willing to change one statement in SM, what justification
do you have for requiring the rest of us to accept the rest of it
unconditionally? Do you have different standards of the arguments you require of us
and of the arguments you allow yourself to use?

I love the way you reply to the bits you (think you) have the answers to and

"...even then they couldn\'t be sure that the Imperials didn\'t have a

Ah! I\'m sorry, I was under the impression that you had claimed that one
reason why transponders couldn\'t be forged was that they exchanged "past
history" notes about their earlier travels and encounters that was so
detailed that it was an impossible task to simulate them. That must have
been someone else, then. I really do have to start keeping back files of
current discussions.

Anyway, just what is the information the Deyo chips exchange and how do they
recognize a perfectly genuine transponder that has been fed false info?

Well, it\'s lucky for me that I have such a knowledgable expert as you to set
me straigth.

Now pay attention: 1) You steal a blank transponder. One of those millions of
transponders that are made at the Central Repository of All Deyo Chips and
shipped all over the Imperium. 2) You bribe someone with the required
knowledge and equipment to install genuine transponders to install it.

Hey presto! You now have a false transponder indistinguishable from a genuine
one.

Right so far.

It surprises me not at all that it is acceptable to you. But it is not what
Survival Margin states: "...over the course of a 12-year phase-in period,
were retrofitted to all existing vessels..." (SM, p. 71). All existing
vessels, it says. The 12 year grace period is what it takes to get all the
way out into the uttermost edges of the Imperium. Including the Spinward
Marches.

Then there are:

_Citizens of the Imperium_, p. 15: "The ship\'s transponders can be altered to
identify the vessel as having any of a variety of missions and identities."

_76 Patrons_, p. 7: "The registration transponder of the vessel will then be
changed, new papers forged, and the ship will be turned over to the
adventurers as payment."

_76 Patrons_, p. 12: "...the ship\'s papers are forged..."

_76P_, p. 13: An adventure involving a scout using his ship to attack a yacht.
Another adventure where the PCs are hired to use their ship in an attack on a
SuSAG facility.

_76 P, p. 37: "The patron does not own the free trader, but has stolen it."

_Knightfall_, p. 45: "[The ship has had] its transponder replaced with a
military grade transponder (one that allows changing IDs from a panel dialog
on the bridge)."

There\'s a whole slew of information in _Starship Operator\'s Manual_ about
civilian and military transponders that runs counter to the info in SM, but
I know you regard DGP publications as non-canonical, so I won\'t bother to
enumerate it.

I\'m confident that there are other instances in _Traveller\'s Digest_ and
_Magatraveller Journal_, but given your attitude to DGP I haven\'t bothered
to go through them.

>the cracks should all be fixed by 1116.

_Knightfall_ is by GDW and is set circa 1120. I can\'t imagine what reason you
will cook up for why that somehow dosen\'t count, but I\'m confident that you
will think of something.

But even without being incessantly logged by every passing merchant, naval
ships will want to be able to broadcast fake IDs on occasion. Anyway, it is
no longer a matter of conjecture on my part; _Knightfall_ states that
military transponders do have that capability.

Until Marc Miller declares the DGP material uncanonical it is just as much
part of the Traveller background as anything else. And I do not concede that
you are entitled to ignore the vast amount of CT material either. Though it
is a very simple way of resolving canon conflict, I give you that: Just cut
the amount of canonical material down to a small fraction of all that has
been published. Simple and effective. But not a solution I accept.

Incidentally, _Knightfall_ takes place in Massila, a core sector, in 1120.

This appears to me to be completely and utterly irrelevant to the discussion

I agree. Real time dycryption would be vertialy imposible, but with
communications lags of a week between systems, if the information is going
out system, you have that time to break the encryption. You may even
arrive in system before the original, and be able to act on the
information gained, if you jumped at the same time.

And as Gary has recently stated several times, the Deyo transponders don\'t
do that. I don\'t know who brought up that particular idea in the first
place, but he didn\'t know what he was talking about.

_Starship Operator\'s Manual_ describes a setup where a transponder is hooked
up into a single virual reality system and switched back and forth between
that and the real world. To make that even remotely fit the description of
the Deyo transponder, said system must be able to fool the transponder into
accepting the fake messages as genuine. My suggestion would be that the VR
system is built around one of those canonical military transponders that can
put out any ID and have it accepted by the civilian transponders.

We game universe builders have a serious problem here. We want our game
universe to be plausible, but we don\'t want it so realistic that it isn\'t
any fun to play with. Sometimes that balance is difficult to achieve.

They don\'t. The fact remains that thousands if not millions of these babies
are floating round the Imperium and I do not find it difficult to believe
that some of them could get diverted on the way. I don\'t really care to go
into details lest I convince myself otherwise ;-).

Yes, but the freedom of my players to do some things without having the
authorities looking over their shoulders is important to me (Mind you, I
want a balance; I don\'t want them to be able to nuke worlds with impunity,
for example).

Your idea of the "clique" is probably closest. If a new gamer sees that,
at his local games shop, all the GURPS players are reasonably normal
people who play to have fun, while all the Traveller players are
middle-aged adolescents who whine, argue about rules, and gloat whenever
they trick someone, which game is he more likely to start playing?

Experienced gamers, such as ourselves, understand that the GROUP matters
more than the GAME SYSTEM.  We can move betwen game systems when necessary
(although we probably have preferences). However, even we are unlikely to
invest in a game system when we dislike the local group who uses it
(unless we already have a group who is willing to switch).

For example, I do not play Warhammer. I was considering it at one time,
because we had a nice student teacher who played it with her friends, and
I figured that even if I wasn\'t fond of the system they were nice folks
who played friendly games. (They didn\'t worry about using \'official\'
figures, etc.) But she moved on, and the only other groups I\'ve seen
locally are people I would rather not deal with. (One got all food banned
from Sci-F World\'s gaming area because they started a food fight, for
example - and some of these people are supposedly adults!)  So, from my
perspective, the local Warhammer munchkins have driven me into rejecting
the game system.

I suspect that I would enjoy playing Traveller with most of you. I suspect
I would enjoy playing most games with most of you. Hell, I like gaming
enough that I\'ll play even with people who I find personally
objectionable, as long as they play the game well (and aren\'t _too_
obnoxious: as a high school teacher I have a high tolerance for
obnoxious). But given my lomited gaming time and money, I\'ll play the
systems that the best local groups play, rather than the best systems that
there are if that means I have to play with munchkins.

Another example; I am not fond of CCGs. I dislike the idea of spending
lots of money on the _chance_ of improving a deck, I dislike the way
people with more expensive decks have a beter chance of winning, and I
dislike the rules-lawyering that I see most of my kids using. I _do_ play
the Babylon 5 CCG, but only because some good friends of mine showed me
that it was fun. If I\'d relied on the 30-year-old greasy-fingered dweebs
at the local games shop, endlessly ranting about whether Superman could
defeat the Enterprise and complaining about their parents wanting rent for
the basement - well, I\'d have decided not to play, because I wouldn\'t have
liked the available groups.

One last time:

The folks down a Steve Jackson Games produce product called GURPS.  This is
the RULES set, and a fairly complete one at that.  With the information in
that book, you could design a couple of worlds to early Traveller standards.

GURPS: Traveller is what those wacky Austinites call a *worldbook*.  It
isn\'t supposed to be a stand alone game.  It\'s supposed to provide
information on playing GURPS in a specific setting.  None of the worldbooks
in my possession have enough rules to play as a stand alone game.  All of
them require GURPS *at a minimum* to play well.  several are greatly
enhanced by ownership of additional GURPS rules and genre books.

GURPS: Traveller provides the bare bones to allow a game similar to classic
Traveller, in the well-known Third Imperium setting.  If you are happy with
the bare bones, you don\'t need a "pile of supplements" to play.  Hell, you
don\'t really need to buy the GURPS rules set, with GURPS lite avalible for
free.

I have run G:T sucessfully.  Without using anything other than the GURPS
rulebook (a system I\'m not very good with) and G:Traveller.

In GURPS, that 14 year old can spend a maximum of 28 points on skills.  The
rule is 2x age.

After a few bouts of getting characters slagged, the others will turn on
the points-munchkin and tell him to lay off, and build a workable
character.  Trust me, I\'ve seen it happen.

In my current CORPS game my wife has the Ministry of Justice as a Level 2
Enemy.  She\'s just very careful about "Imoperial Entanglements"

It\'s perfectly acceptable to lay down the law: no hunteds.  Or to impose a
group hunted on the party (The Archbishop of Snerd is after all of you!)

  As a somewhat more advanced lesson in logistics we can consider the stocks
of food and fuel needed to keep a population center functioning, and how 
little they have stored on site. Even without getting into the destruction
of said stockpiles, a properly equipped military (if it somehow, quite
strangely, felt the unifrom need) could bring at least the major population
(and thus, typically production as well) centers back under control in a
matter of days or a week or so.

  Tank farms, airports, roads, bridges, airliners, rail -lines, -yards,
barges, freighters, pipelines, and trains are all fairly easily neutralized
without effective opposition. Warehouses also have notoriously poor evasive
qualities.

I did not mean monitors as a ship class.  I ment the ironclad called
Monitor.  One of the first two ironclads along with the Merrimack.  The
battle between them was inconclusive.

SO the transponders and an Iluminati plot.  Now THAT makes sence!  The
reason they can be broke is they used the orbital mind control lasers to
make use believe they could not be broken.  That explains why some people
can\'t see reason.  Oh well I guess I\'ll have to get my fellow Gnomes of
Zurick to knock those laser our with ASAT so we can take over the Empires\'
econoy for our own profit.  A Gnomes work is never done...sigh...

They would fight.  Pirates do not want to meet a patrol ship except maybe yo
ambush it.  Also what happen when a 400 ton patrol ship meet a 4000 ton
pirate?  Whos target drone then?

Doing it\'s nornal business.  The pirate meet the legal ship at prearrange
deep space points as discribed in the traveller adventure.  No anomolies.
The legal ship makes deep space jumps regularly and sometimes it meet the
pirate.

Thank you for the information.  The period you discribe is not one I have
studied.  I am a history buff, as many gamers are.  My prefered period is
WW2.  My father and uncles served in the pacific so it\'s also a little
family history as well.  One of my uncles was in the Enola Gay group as a
A&E mechanic.  I guess I\'m a born and bread \'gear\' head.

How is that.  There is nothing in cannon that says a jumping ship is
detectable apone arrival execpt by normall sensor scan.  Space is real big
and active searches like radar and lidar have limited range. The pirate is
not sending any siganl so how would the system know about it\'s presents.
Again canon sugests this is posible in many adventure books like \'Rock and a
Hard Place" with the asteroid ship Rock and the shuttle Pebble.

Again your knowledge of this era is far beter than mine.  Also your above
coralary is also correct.  There is the complication of a non limear aproach
to such problems.  Midevil fortifications could not be breached directly but
were easily defeated by blockade and sapping.  Tactic beating Technology.
The Majinoe Line (or however it\'s spelled) of the french was bypassed and
left to \'wither on the vine\'.  The same was true for the Japanese fortress
islands.  We took what we needed and starved the others out.

In war some truely bizar solutions appear like the banglador torpedo
(shudder) and the flame thrower.  What sane person would want to use either
of these systems under fire?  But at the time they were the current state of
the art in siege craft evolution.  War is a desperate undertaking.  A
desperate men will often come up with desperate solutions to problems.
Solutions that no sane person under other situations would use but when you
are going to die if you don\'t do something then even a suicidal act that
give a small chance to live is better than just waiting to die and sometimes
you come up with entirely new workable solutions in that desperate moment.
Many of the WWII air combat tactics were born out of a moments desperation.  

The entire battle of Iron Bottom Sound was an act of desperation and was won
by another desperate act.  What sane person would send destroyers into
direct short range combat against battle ships and cruisers?  But it WORKED.
The escort carriers got away (except two) and the Japanese lost all there
capital ships that night except one and that one was sunk the next morning.
Tatics defeats firepower and surprise that night but the cost was brutal.
Desperate men in desperate time doing what HAD to be done.  Never
underestimate the power of desperate men.  They can and have done the
\'imposible\' many times.

This is a new developement to me.  I\'ll have to look into it.  It sounds
quite reasonable.  If the public key is longer than the session key the the
message would have to be decoded using the brute force method as the session
key could not be reliably decoded directly.  This would indeed increase
security by an order of magitude.

That is not necessary.  There is already a skill cap based on age.  A 14
year old can only have 28 points in skills and being dyslexic they would
have to be skills that could be aquired without reading.  (I disagree with
this because dyslexia should be a level based disadvantage as you can have a
mild case that can be mitigated with training.)  So that problem has already
been delt with.  It kid could have an ammazing DEX and be a world class
scateboarder though.  I\'ve run kid\'s campains before that were a lot of fun
and laughs AKA the Goonies.  The skill cap makes it real interesting.  I
have also run a fantacy street kids campain.  REAL gritty and down and out.
Finding dinner and avoiding the orphin patrol (and worse) were daily activities.

True, and not true also.  Most of my gaming group are or were military.
Including SF, Rangers, Airforce, Support services, and one Navy.  All of
them agreed that IF it came to US vs ARMY the ARMY would loose.  I should
note that none of them were tankers but some were Vetnam combat vets and
about a third of my last gaming group went to Desert Shield/Storm.  One of
them was in ground suport helos. and just took his 30 year retirement.  He
said the military could not win in a fight vs. the people.  I\'m paraphasing
the arguments of 6 different carier military people that had this discussion
in our group.  It\'s their \'pratical knowledge\' but it aggrees with and
supports my own ideas of the dynamics of such a situation.

As for myself, I was not physically able to join the military when I was 18
nor would they take me now even in an emergency (except maybe as non combat
suport staff if they were desperate for the technical help).  My father was
a WWII vet, so were most of my uncles.  If it came to the US vs a military
dictater I know which side I\'d fight for.

One good thing is that insergences are not so picky about health problems.
I dought I would last long in open combat.  I\'m not physically up to it but

I am aware of the odds of ONE sniper.  Are you aware of how many people in a
town of 50,000 have guns in the US?  Are you aware of the population of the
US?  Are you aware of the size of the US military?  Can you say outnubered
10000 to one!?  And exactly where do YOU think your supplies come from?
What happens when a tank gun shell detonates IN in tank\'s gun?  The Germans
learned the hard way it\'s not a good idea to use ammo made by those that
disagree with you.

Your recon team would be outnumbered 100 to one on the emenies home ground.
No recon, sorry dead.  Are you willing to bomb and destroy the assets you
need?  That is the only way you\'d clear a path and then you\'re going to turn
those \'brown shirts\' into white shirts with guns pointed your way.  Kill a
man\'s familly and you got someone with ONLY revenge to live for.  THAT is
one VERY dangerious man.

Yep, this is the USA of course their would be but if you tried to turn it
into a military dictatership you would loose.  Too many people would get it
that their precious ox was going to get gored and that they would NOT be one
of the ones in power.

Also a lot of good men in the military would turn because they believe in
the american way of life and are men of contience.  They took a oath to
defend the CONSTITUTION against all enemies forien and domestic.  Which side
would YOU take?  Would you help install any of your generals as King for
Life over the USA?  Where would your loyalties lie?

I have no idea who gave the BBs the Big brother idea.  It was a topic when I
joined this group two weeks ago when I learned it existed.  All I have been
saying was that the BBs could not be that intrusive because the TU sociaty
does not show the marks of such tight fisted control and that an unbeatable
BB was not posible.  Those were my only two points that I wanted to make.

So do I.  It\'s the feel of the background that make me think that the Big
Brother version of the black box is not posible.  That and CT canon any way.
I never said that the boxes could do that level of survelence.  I said that
it was NOT in the nature of the TU for them to work like that.

In the end it is the purpose of all government to maintain the status quo
and to gain as much power as is required to do so.  The wise ones also leave
enough \'loop holes\' so people can breath and keep themselves amused with
power and money grubing.  A people with no social or economic mobility
become restless and hard to control but it they are all busy trying to \'get
theirs\' they are not out causing the government to many problems.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
IMO, any A, B, or C port needs to have a stock of transponders on
hand for replacement and repair - maybe not a big stock, but these
boxes are technology, and technology fails. Ditto any Scout, Navy
or Merchant Base that does starship (or even spaceship) repair.

Question, though: how long does it take to (legally) replace a
transponder?

A ship comes out of jump at a medium pop B-starport system
a little off the X-boat routes. It manuevers, but has no transponder
or commo. A fighter flight intercepts, gets close and hears the
captain transmitting through a short-range jury-rigged commo
link. He\'s an honest merchant captain, a power surge as they
entered jumpspace wrecked their commo array - about a week\'s
work in a B-class port. The transponder read the surge as a
tamper attempt and fried itself. _Lady Jane_ gets boarded by
customs police, then flies formation with the patrol craft to the repair yards.

_Lady Jane_ spends about 50% of her time visiting small, low-tech
worlds (D & E class starports), many of which have incomplete, missing
or late shipping reports. She spends another 20% or more of her time
visiting independent worlds past the Imperial frontier - Imperial Navy
craft may have seen her on some of her visits, but the governments of
these worlds don\'t regularly report their ship traffic to the Imperium.
Her last port-of-call was at the E-class starport a parsec away,
and the couple hundred belters there (the only population) are
notorious for keeping incomplete shipping records.
Her papers appear in order, though the home port is a couple
sectors away - like the Jameison Factors ship in DGP\'s SOM, 
_Lady Jane_ hasn\'t seen her home port of record for more than a decade.
_Lady Jane_ is still under bank mortgage, the captain makes a payment
when she comes into port. He\'s been here before, though only a few
times - he\'s in the records, and there are people on planet who have
done business with him before. 

(Just to be nasty: One of the people he\'s done business with before
considers him a cheat, though he isn\'t, due to a soured business deal)

Question: How long will it take for _Lady Jane_ to get a new transponder?

She can\'t go anywhere without one, and a delay as little as two months
would cause serious (perhaps ship-threatening) financial hardship
for her owner.


IMTU, _Lady Jane_ gets her new transponder from replacement stocks
at the starport while the ship is being repaired. A harbormaster looks
over her papers, checks whatever information he has on hand and
makes a judgement call as to whether something fishy is going on.
Is this the fourth ship to jump in from next door with a failed transponder
this month? Does the Captain\'s story match the damage on the ship?
(for ethically-challenged harbormasters) Is the bribe big enough?
If the harbormaster clears it, _Lady Jane_ can go on her way - with
records of her new transponder code going out on the next courier.
Otherwise, the Captain gets to hear those fatal words:

"We\'ll need to get confirmation on this..."

While a modern 5" mount might try to hit a missile, it\'s unlikely that
it would - a sea-skimming missile that travels at Mach 2 covers the
distance from the radar horizon to impact in *seconds*. Even a gun-based
CIWS (the Phalanx 20mm or Goalkeeper 30mm mounts) have problems with the
modern sea skimmers - the current favoured solution are point-defence
missile systems (Sea Wolf, RAM).

An added bonus to always the same number of dice is that the referee can
_conceal_ the true task difficulty, leaving it up to the players to notice
that they should have failed, but didn\'t, therefore... (OK, I\'m evil. But
I have alert players who _like_ figuring out clues.)

I love FF&S, assuming that the explanations are a bit better. But then I\'m
an engineer. T5 also needs a simple plug-n-play system for non-gearheads
that is _compatible_ with the more complicated one.

A problem with a purely simple system (at least for me) is that my
Traveller group is very technical, and tends to notice things like
starships that are inexplicably slow (or fast), robots that double as room
heaters, and other technical mixups.

That\'s not the segment of the market I was talking about.  I was refering to 
people who\'ve never played an RPG before, and thus wouldn\'t *have* any GURPS 
stuff laying around at all.

  In that case, I\'d be quite surprised if TL 25-35 _couldn\'t_ defeat the
described capabilities of the SDG; it\'s likely of limited applicability
except as a deus ex to remove those units on some basis, though.

  The further implications of said unit would be troubling, especially
as its\' first use by most players would be to copy itself...

If they require this information/items.  That may not be so.  The egnigma

Then explain the traveller adventure.  It takes plave after your grace

The Marches are part of the Empire.  By your own posts all transponders were

I do just that quite often.  What make you think a headless nail can\'t be

Media is not relavent.  Partical type is not relavent.  If the transmiter

What is fb?  Fiber optic?  If so them make before break taps and splices

The EM spectrum is LIMITED.  Your chip lifeforms can only percieve what
their sensors can recieve.  Bandwith is limited.  Type of modulation is
limited and all of this is monitorable and spoofable.  This type of
fingerprinting is used today and is fakeable today.  The military call this
SIGINT.

First you say they are simisentiant and not they are smarter than sentiant
life?  Please make up your mind.  If the firing were \'random\' them it would
not be recognizable.  That is what random means!  You can not design at or
near the uncurtainty limit.  If the chips can recognise a predictable drift
in signal patern then human who are far smarter can instament a forgery.  A
human with the proper equipment can moniter the entire EM spectrum.  There
are no secret places in the EM spectrum.

Their is neither time nor bandwith for me to educate you.  You would argue
that what I was saying was opinion if I said the sun was HOT!  As for the
races in the above they are simply different animals and very plausable.
Laser work and they have useable range.  Range is limited in the atmosphere.
The Nova project has a \'spinal mount\' size laser for fusion research.  It
has been operational for 15 years.  It could blow a 4 inch hole through a
concrete block wall in a fration of a second.

No, not how I interpret it.  The way it is!  The processes discribed in GK
are how chips are forged TODAY.  That means the GK chips are TODAYS process.
REREAD IT!  It classic and some of the best SF I have ever read.  The
process discribed define exactly how these chip creatures work.  There is no
mistery to anyone who know the process.  There capabilities can easily be
extrapolated from this data.  Form and function are enexerably linked.

No organic.  Nerual networks.  I have never seen any canon that said
organic!  The chips in GK are not ORGANIC.  They are silicon based.  Organic
means carbon based.

Then by this definition YOU CAN NOT STATE THAT YOUR INTERPRTATION IS VALID
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FROM THE 57TH CENTURY.  Invalid argument.  Try taking a
debating class.  There are rules.  You\'ve exceeded your premise here.  We

our interpretations as to what IS canon.

That\'s logical.  Unfortunately logic is not something that our oposition in

would be to get the original writer of TNE to send a noterised affadavid to
him my registered mail.  (Grin)  It\'s reached the point of faith to him.

I\'d guess they compare passwords.  One enquires for a responce to code
1234567 and get a responce to compare to it\'s data base then the other
repetes the process untill some level of confidence in each others identity

Works for me.  You could even bribe an official for one of those

I do not understands it either.  I plan on planing GT.  The transponders in
one strip or another will be there.  I\'d like to solve this with either
logic and canon or a ruling from traveller creater.

We had someone try to post some general discussion to the TNS mailing list,
and naturally it bounced, but it brings up the question: Where should we
(SJ Games) send people who want to talk about GURPS Traveller. I think a
GURPS Traveller specific board might be a good idea as a single place to
talk specific rules mechanics and the like, however...

I also feel, like many on this list, that Traveller has grown beyond a
single set of rules mechanics, and that the TML is diverse enough to
support GURPS Traveller in addition to all the others. I\'m going to propose
that SJ Games set up a discussion board as part of their regular bulletin
board sstem, but I\'d also like to post information on the Web site so
people can sign up to the TML. I\'m not sure how much it would increase the
traffic. Frankly, I think that most of the real Traveller fanatics (GURPS
or others) ALREADY subscribe to the TML. I think a civilized, open
discussion of all backgrounds is a good thing (we can leave the "my rules
are better than your rules" arguments for e-mail -- I also propose that we
cancel the semi-annual
pirates-dropping-big-rocks-on-virus-infested-robots-discussing-economics
discussion...: )

Can someone save me a lot of effort and shoot me the "how to subscribe"
instructions? I\'ll wait a day or two, and if there is a huge groundswell of
public opinion on here against it, I\'ll reconsider. Consider this your
opportunity to wean GURPS players over to the "One True Way(tm)" whatever
you feel that is...

And if you want to do *that* you buy GURPS Space instead of GURPS
Traveller, which makes no bones whatsoever about being a method of porting
Traveller\'s setting into the GURPS rule mechanic.

Space is set of generic rules for science fiction role playing, much like
what you got in Books 2 and 3 of the LBB set.

Virginia?  Is that a ship?  Or the state?  As far as I know there were only
two ironclads in the cival war.  The ones mentioned above and as far as I
know neither ever sank any other ship.

They were both badly under guned due to weight of armor.  They were also not
very good designs.  One sank in a mild storm.  Later designs worked better.

Uhhh...they _did_ have working Enigmas. One was recovered from Poland in
1939, the Enigma had been a _commercial_ product in the 30\'s.

They also got a number of sets of enigma code pads, were routinely able
to learn the wheel order, and got an enormous amount of the information
they needed to break the Enigma codes by decrypting identical texts
transmitted in a far inferior code used by the German Naval Weather
service.

No, use Albedo instead. That gives you the warlike "bunnies", but also
other "animals". And the history up thru the last issue I read (several
years back) *would* fit some weirdness on Grandfather\'s part.

You could homebrew your own stuff with the LBBs.  Mercenary (LBB 4) came out 
in \'78 with an expanded chargen for military characters as well as the 
beginnings of the Striker combat system.  High Guard cane out originally in 
\'79, with the 2nd Edition (the most common one) in \'80.  Striker came out in 
\'81.  Scouts as mentioned in \'83.  So you\'re telling me people had to wait 5 
years for a playable system?  I don\'t think so.  I was playing it in \'78.

The LBB\'s mentioned generic vehicles like air rafts, ACV\'s & ATV\'s.  It gave 
prices & capabilities (as in, weighs XX tons, travels at YY kph, etc).  It 
also had a basic ship design sequence for ships under 1000 tons displacement, 
ships that characters would concievably have access to.  Basic stuff, but 
useable.

I don\'t see this.  Still no star system generation, still no starship design.  We\'ll shelve vehicle design for now, even though the LBBs didn\'t *design* them, they at least told you the *capabilities*.

there are several cannon sources that indicate a "Jump Transition
Phenomena" of over a minute of duration, with intense visual and possibly
other (non-EM) radiative effects.

just a brief list: High Guard, DGP\'s SSoM, TNE Regency Sourcebook, MTJ, at
least one old JTAS article.

Broad area monitoring is apparent from the rules of 5fw and High Guard.
Also, keep in mind that a heplar flare has a higher energy density than
neighbor stars (in terms of photons to reciever) if you are looking at the
right end. There are multiple ways to find a ship, and most aren\'t really
that high tech, just infrastructurally intensive.

Two patrol cruisers have more extra-atmospheric sensor capability outward
than Earth has now. Hubble is able to detect (and image) jovian worlds at 8
LY. 30 hubbles designed for in-system rather than deep field, with
sufficient computational back-up could detect a jump sig, and then doo a
narrower higher resolution scan of the area.

Based upon 5fw, Invasion Earth, Imperium, Dark Nebula, and High Guard,
jumping to the inner system has always been detectable.

Since, until the tiff between ADB and TFG is resolved, there is no
production of SFB... don\'t hold your breath.
ADB writes and owns the copyrights.
TFG publishes under exclusive liscence and sells to distributers.
TFG has failed to pay ADB for over a year on products already sold.
ADB won\'t make more til they get paid or TFG gives up the exclusive
printing/distribution rights.
TFG won\'t pay til they get more product.

In Peter Hamilton\'s Reality Dysfunction books,  there are "affinity-links"
that bond a human master with a pet.  In the book, a local sheriff-type
on a colony planet is linked to a dog that he uses for tracking, fighting,
etc.  He could receive the dogs senses and command the dog as well.

I think a small a "Pets & Pests" or "101 Critters" might be a great
resource.  Everything from Cats to Rats, Dogs to Parrots, and . . .
(cue shark music from Jaws) . . . the dreaded . . . the feared . . .
. . .

No. But I have a minor race creation system in draft form. Want to start

      A minor race template, or creation system would be invaluable.  The
      minor races where never given enough attention in previous edditions.
      The main books had infered that there were many different minor human
      races all decended from the people the ancients took from earth, but
      never did more than a few write-ups.  It would add alot of color to
      the game if one of the PC\'s was a member of a minor race.

Actually, I thought that movie was cute.  The guy started out with a pair of

First, I really enjoyed your write up about the cat.  It was
great.  :-)

Second, I can remember that Andre Norton used cats
on board her trading vessels.  They were commonly used
to keep pests off ship.

In the case of the LBB adventure _Expedition to Zhodane_, the
asteroid-hulled ship _Rock_ was a special case. It was pretty low
displacement (200dtns, IIRC), and looked like an asteroid.

_Rock_ jumps in system, creating a jump-transition signal. The
scanners in-system detect the signal - or, more likely, detect a
"possible signal". They point their high-res stuff in that direction,
and see nothing - or maybe notice an asteroid drifting in open space,
an asteroid that may be small enough to have escaped notice.

The crew of _Rock_ sits quiet for a while, until those who own the
system get bored and look elsewhere.

I\'d say that a ship bigger than _Rock_ would make a bigger signature
on jump exit - go from "possible" signal to "probable" (or even "definite")
signal, get more than passing attention when it comes in. So _Rock_\'s
special case only applies to tiny, rock-hulled starships.

fwiw, I don\'t use a massive jump-transition signature IMTU...I like to make
sneaky ship movements easier to do, it gives all those fightercraft
and patrol cruisers something to do. If you can patrol an entire star
system from a couple big satellites around the main world,
where\'s the fun in that?

Nice clear INACCURATE info.   I.e. aircraft and helocopters that can
work WITHOUT atmospheres (helocopters WILL NOT work in very thin
atmospheres, most will not work in thin atmospheres), watercraft that
will work with no atmosphere (without atmosphere the only water found
will be frozen), many vehicles (all types) that can operate without
atmosphere that do not have life support/sealed environment.

I agree with JOT, it doesn\'t seem to work anymore (I\'ve deleted it
from MTU).

Another change was to replace first aid and medical with surgery
and medicine - I don\'t like having two skills one of which is a
subset

I think that JoT is a useful skill to have remain in the Traveller
universe (I have kept it in MTU through all rules iterations). 
However, I don\'t allow it to be used as a "universal skill" but rather
as a "skill enabler."  I have always thought of it as having a broad
experience base, and a knack for learning how things work _while_ 
working on them, and a quick study of the basic information on a
system or skill.  I have a brother-in-law who I consider to have some
level of JoT, because he seems to be able to pick up any activity by
reading a couple of books and playing around with it some.  He doesn\'t
become an expert, but can do enough to make things work for a while.
Something more along the lines of having worked on the engine in your
own car, and then being able to look under the cover of a gas
generator and say "Yep, that must be the spark plug.  See, it doesn\'t
have any wire on it and I remember the spark plugs always needed wires
in my car.  Maybe I need to connect this wire to it to make it work." 
Or perhaps something like "I have Windows 95 on my machine at home,
but this is not \'95.  However, there are some similar ideas here, and
there is a menu bar.  Perhaps the Edit menu in this MacWrite program
has some of the same functions as the Word program that I am used to."
 Or perhaps "The gunnery seargent on the ship I was on during my term
with the IN liked me, and showed me around the turrets and let me play
on the missile weapons simulator for an hour.  This sand-caster turret
seems to have some similar controls, maybe I will fiddle a few minutes
and see what they do."  Or perhaps "I\'ve flown helicopters for three
years, but this is my first time in a 747 cockpit.  Unfortunately the
pilot and co- are dead, so I guess I\'m the most qualified here.  The
radio looks familiar, so I will call the tower and have them walk me
through the things I don\'t catch onto."

I believe the Merrimac was also called the Virginia.

I think the Monitor was specifically designed to defeat the Merrimac which was
destroying all the Union ships.

I\'ve wanted to run a scenario from White Dwarf magazine for a while,

One of the pregenerated characters included had one skill, and one

With the "skill enabler" concept, how would such a character be
run? Would you have to give her some default skills to base her
actions off of - say handgun-0, vacc-0, grav-0 and computer-0?

Let\'s say someone rolls up an Imperial Scout, he serves one

Starships pretty well, ship\'s boats at level zero, and anything with
a control panel he can fake it...but he\'s useless when he isn\'t
sitting in a pilot station. That may, of course, be the idea.

All skills in CT are not created equal. Liaison-2 is as good as
Admin-1, and as good as Streetwise-1, and twice as good as
either in specific Liaison situations. JoT-3 does not need to be
as useful as Pilot-3, but should give the character something
for his three skill rolls.

I agree. I hate the "my rules are better than your rules" arguments. I find this
list valuable because

a) it gives me ideas for adventures to run my players in
b) it gives me "tweaks" I can apply to my rules, which resemble canon less and
less each day
c) it provides me with a forum to ask questions, usually ones that my players
have asked me and to which I\'ve responded "uuuhhh ... I\'ll get back to you"

I welcome any G:T submissions to this list. If someone finds rules in G:T that
work better than in another system, and describes them in a rational way, I\'ll
read it and may end up changing my rules accordingly.

So, bring \'em on!

The \'Virginia\' is the actual name of the vessel, not the "Merrimack".

The Merrimack was name of the Union frigate salvaged from the Norfolk
Naval Yard, refitted with armor and christened the "Virginia" The
Virginia first attacked and sank 2 Union blockade ships before the
memorable, if inconclusive battle with the Monitor.

The Monitor sank in a _gale_ off the atlantic coast., and if I recall
correctly it was due to a hatch either breaking off or being left open
accidentally. There was an article in the National Geographic in the
last couple of years about it, as they found the wreck and raised parts
of it.

This from the Encyclopedia Britannica on the subject of ironclads:

"The use of larger guns with more penetrating power and explosive
shells made armour plating imperative. Among early experiments were
floating armoured batteries built for the Crimean War. Heavy
wrought-iron plates over a thick wooden backing gave these
flat-bottomed vessels outstanding protection as they carried
large-shell guns close inshore. (see also Index: armour plate) 

"Other developments followed swiftly. The British soon built the first
iron-hulled floating batteries. The French followed with the Gloire, the
first seagoing armoured warship, protected throughout her entire
length by a wrought-iron belt of 4.3- to 4.7-inch armour backed by 26
inches of wood. Displacing 5,617 tons, she mounted 36 large shell
guns and could steam at 13.5 knots; a three-masted sailing rig
supplemented the engines. Gloire was the first of a series of ironclads
laid down by Napoleon III; 13 similar ships soon followed, then
two-decker armoured rams. Great Britain countered with the Warrior,
the first iron-hulled, seagoing, armoured man-of-war. Much larger
than the Gloire, she displaced 9,210 tons, mounted 28 seven-inch
shell guns, had slightly lighter armour, carried sails, and was one knot
faster. 

"These first ironclads were commissioned on the eve of the American
Civil War, in which ironclads were destined to take a decisive part.
The war itself produced several spectacular developments, including
pioneer submarines, the first aircraft carriers (to handle balloons for
observation), and the torpedo boat, one of several means the
Confederates explored in trying to break the blockade. These little
craft
had weak steam engines and mounted a torpedo lashed to a spar
projecting from the bow. Called Davids, they were weak but definite
forerunners of the torpedo boat and the versatile destroyer. 

"Ironclad warships were crucial, perhaps decisive, in the North\'s
victory
over the South. Partial ironclads appeared early on the western rivers
and spearheaded Union general Ulysses Grant\'s victories in 1862.
River and coastal ironclads (ultimately, mostly monitors) dominated
the war against the South in attacks from the sea and in decisive
support of land operations from the Mississippi system to the
Chesapeake Bay and James River. 

"Most memorable of the combats was
the duel between the Monitor and Virginia (better known as the
Merrimack). When the Federal forces lost Norfolk Naval Shipyard in
Portsmouth, Va., in April 1861, they burned several warships,
including the heavy steam frigate Merrimack. The Confederates raised
the Merrimack, installed a ram and slanting casemates made from
railroad track over thick wooden backing, as had been done in the
Gloire, and renamed it Virginia. Mounting 10 guns, including four
rifled ones, the Virginia, with yard workmen still on board finishing
up, sailed on March 8, 1862, for its trial run. Defying concentrated
fire
of ship and shore batteries, it sank two ships of the Union\'s wooden
blockading fleet before retiring with the ebbing tide. In this dramatic
moment John Ericsson\'s Monitor arrived from New York during the
middle of the night. Displacing fewer than 1,000 tons, less than
one-third of the Virginia, the Monitor had a boxlike iron hull
supporting an iron-plated wooden raft on which revolved the turret.
The 172-foot-long vessel had little freeboard except for the thickly
armoured rotating turret within which were mounted two 11-inch
smoothbores. (see also Index: Monitor and Merrimack, Battle of) 

"The Monitor had many deficiencies. Not really a seagoing warship, it
had nearly sunk on its voyage down from New York and did sink on its
next sea voyage. Yet it proved the equal of its rival in their duel on
March 9. The battle ended in a draw with neither ship seriously
injured, but the repercussions of this first duel between completely
ironclad warships swept the world. 

"On April 4, scarcely more time than required for a ship to cross the
Atlantic, Great Britain ordered the 131-gun ship of the line, the Royal
Sovereign, to be cut down, armoured, and fitted with turrets. Only
three and a half weeks later Great Britain laid down the Prince Albert,
the Royal Navy\'s first iron-hulled turret ship, mounting four turrets. 

"The Union Navy ordered 66 coastal and river monitors; these were
low freeboard ships that were unsuitable for high-seas action and
rarely suitable for long voyages. Many were not completed in time for
war service. Besides the Virginia, the Confederates began a number of
other ironclads. Several of these rendered valuable service and
probably lengthened the war, but most had to be destroyed before
completion. Out of a combination of characteristics of the Monitor and
Virginia types evolved the battleship, which was next to rule the sea."

Okay, I must just live in a boring RPG town, and I don\'t go to conventions
so I see none of this. I tend to buy stuff based on how it looks and reads
rather than the people who play it (there\'s not many opportunities to see
people playing most games around here).

Again, since I tend to play with my friends, and I don\'t really hop around
from group to group, I guess I see none of this.

The worse the Warhammer folks do around here is yelp with glee or cheer
raucously. On occasion, they block my path when I want to check out
Traveller stuff or GURPS stuff. :-)

Question (not a hassle) are the people you play with so set in their ways
that they won\'t try something new?

I think that\'s what it boils down to: the friend factor, which is why I
don\'t see much of this stuff. I don\'t solicit alot of advice from my local
hobby shop people (most of them don\'t have a clue anyway, which is good
because they don\'t tend to order based on sales trends [which is why T4 was
actually available]).

I dunno. I always find it very interesting when two different people have
such different experiences with the same things.

Then how do you explain the posibility of clandestine recon.?  Like the
\'Rock and a Hard Place\' and several others?  Is it necessary to jump in at
say the orbit of pluto to be undetected?  Regardless of the number of
sensors with enough distance you get below the resolvable angle for light
for an object of ship size.

Is this ANOTHER question to refer to Marc?

As for heplar I have never used them.  I\'m a CT player myself.

As long as an armed rabble can understand small unit doctrine, avoid
informants, avoid situations where the government forces can use their
greatly superior firepower, maintain their morale under conditions of poor
supply and medical care and have a secure base in which to train recruits
and so on, they\'ll be fine.

Having a government opposing you which does not have a political
understanding of counter-insurgency helps a lot too.

Look up a decent history on what happened to Che, the Black Panthers, the
Malaya campaign and the Red Brigades. All of them had substantial support.
All of them lost.

Depends how militarised the society is. Check out, say, the American Civil

Transponder boxes dont need to be some unbreakable black box.

Thats what ships papers are for. See, if you are a multi-million credit
merchant ship with a multi-million credit turnover, you leave paperwork
lying around. Registry dockets. Bank payments. Annual maintainence bills.
Bills of lading. Stevedoring contracts. Customs clearance paperwork. Bar
tabs. Restaurant tabs. Hotel bills. Brokerage fees.

You also leave memories, and you often leave ex-crewmen.

If something doesnt check out - a wrong pattern, a cargo route that is on
the face of it non-viable, a ship that buys or sells cargo but not both, a
ship that has a route that indicates it might be trying to outrun the
X-boats - some faceless bureaucrat will drop your name on a \'watch list\'.

If you are on a watch list and you show up somewhere, then they have an
idea you might be a problem, so your records, and perhaps you, get checked
a little more thoroughly.

Every month, three months, or even when the IISS detatched duty courier
drops by, watch lists get exchanged (1). If you are on a watch list and
either something turns up or you dont turn up *anywhere*, then you go onto
an alert list.

If you are on an alert list, then there are a bunch of things that could be
done if you turn up and things dont fit. The most obvious is to have you
offered a routine but moderatly lucrative contract, just to keep you in the
area (2).

Oh, and I\'m not proposing the State does this. See, the *real* victims of
piracy are the banks and insurance companies, as most shippers will insure
cargos, and most owners insure their ships.

It is relativly simple for them to set up a data clearinghouse between all
the various financial bodies to keep an \'ugly mugs\' list. The repair yards
and so on will presumably assist - at least if they want financing for
their new equipment.

Did I mention that people who deal exclusivly in cash, and demand no
receipts, make alert lists automatically ? And that ships who suddenly turn
up from far away, especially with logs that indicate they might be trying
to outrun the X-boats, get checked out as well ?

Finally, the nobility have traditionally had a close and wonderful
relationship with financiers. And ask yourself - if you are the Imperium,
and you need a couple of teracredits for the Frontier War, is it easier to
raise it yourself, or write a note to Hortalez et Cie ?

Now, none of this stops ethically-challenged civilians trying to stretch
the system. There are loopholes, and records can be made to disappear. But,
please, give the System some credit.

(1) This is very close to what I do at work - fraud prevention for
outsourced contracts in an Australian government department. We deal with
1400 seperate contracts worth about $2.1 billion split between about 300
contractors dealing with about 1.1 million clients for about two million
payable events per year. We have 4 people in our section, plus a
theoretical one dedicated staffer in each of six State Offices. I really,
really think that any world would have the capability to track the ships
that trade on it, provided it is willing to collect basic records.

(2) This is where the IN using civilian merchant ships helps a lot. Hire
them to \'assist with Fleet Maneuvers\' ... they will stay out of trouble
until their records show up. And if not, well you can always remind them

GT has ship design and several sample vehicles with much more detail than

No, unfortunately. (Usual excuses - I don\'t get paid for this, don\'t

working on my Military (Space) Combat System). I was never sure who was

I\'m assuming you mean a pyramid board. I think a board to discuss specific 
G:T would be a good idea as its likely to give the game more exposure. 
However I also think (given the plethora of Trav mailing lists) its not really 
neccessary. I think in a week or so the "grumpy old men" (myself included) will 
get over G:T\'s supposed shortcomings and get back to the subject at hand and 
maybe even propose some "solutions" to the "problems".

Here are the instructions for subscribing to the TML

Send a message to majordomo@MPGN.COM.  including in the _body_ of the 
message:

	subscribe traveller
OR
	subscribe traveller-digest

You might also want to mention that there are a wide range of other mailing 
lists covering specific aspects of the Traveller universe, but that the TML is a 
good place for the beginner to start.

I\'d like to see a 2 tier character generation mechanism as per CT (as of books 4-7)
and MegaTraveller. Basic character generation as per Basic Traveller and Citizens,
and additionally for major alien races,  should be in the basic game and advanced
character generation could be published in later extended modules. Unlike CT there
should be no difference between the skills attainable in basic character generation
and advanced generation - advanced generation should merely provide extra colour, and
it should be made clear that this is the case.

I\'d additionally like to see NPC secondary characteristic vectors as per those
proposed way back in White Dwarf (51?) to help determine NPC reaction rolls.

As a game mechanic, interrupts are OK. Maybe the task system needs a basic and
advanced variant for learning referees/players.

Hear, hear. Actually I prefer High Guard (because life\'s too short ...) Again, it
should be possible to develop compatible basic and advanced design rules which cover
design for ships, vehicles and equipment, including robots. Also a sensible, balanced
supplement containing samples in each group early in the release cycle of a game
would be good - ie not a starships volume, or fighting ships of the shattered
imperium, but a volume containing enough in each category for a non-gearhead to get
by without having to design anything.

I liked the equipment sheets used by DGP. Among the things they provided were
variants for different tech levels. If possible the format should be revived for
equipment supplements.

When it came to ship combat, GDW too often went in for complex boardgames which I\'m
guessing lost money.  I generally conduct ship combat using the task system and in a
pretty abstract manner. For the RPG keep it abstract and away from boardgame-type
semantics. Boardgames are useful for conducting large complex battles but by and
large I keep such things out of role playing sessions, and when they arise I know the
macro-level results in advance.

There should be enough in the initial game release to support alien NPCs at least,
and in Traveller this means that they should be capable of random generation. So as
above provide basic character generation in a range of careers and enough to run
alien characters, at least for widespread aliens (major races, plus human variants
such as Vilani and Solomani, plus widespread minor races such as the Newts).

I think:
a) Pick a milieu for the basic setting of the game. Multiple milieus are confusing to
new players, and the game design is still slanted towards the classic era. So
probably CT or MT.
b) Picking a milieu now means picking a timeline. In my view the GURPS guys have got
this broadly right (I\'d personally prefer to see a "canon" timeline which avoids the
virus, and which generally proceeds along the lines set out in MTJ 4, with stable
polities emerging from the civil war) although over time the degree of divergence
will probably increase.
c) Picking a milieu means you can get by with a single setting and publish others in
supplements or through franchises. If T5 and GURPS shared the same timeline/milieu
they could extend "published space" through a system similar to the land grant system
that operated under CT.

Also, world generation is too geared towards the Imperium - for referees who want to
stay in the Traveller universe but explore their own worlds (eg core and rim
expeditions) it would be nice to have "blank slate" world generation rules.

I think the idea of the colour plates was to attract new players and thereby bring
down the price point for all of us. I agree it didn\'t particularly add anything. One
of the other differences from the black and white material in MT was that the layout
was far better in MT - for all the bugs, the layout made the material far more
comprehensible than in later versions. Also better layout meant that B&W
illustrations weren\'t published at 4 or 6 times their optimum size as they were in
TNE and T4. Bring back Rob Caswell, basically - not just for illos but for design.

> This would be my dream version of Traveller,

It would need to go beyond that to have a sensible program for the supplements to be
published, and the quality thereof. With MT, I liked the choices that DGP made about
what kind of supplement to publish. I\'m impressed that GURPS will be following a
broadly similar path, and applaud SJG for it, but at the end of the day I\'d like to
see the supplements come out for "Real Traveller".

     I for one think that would be a great idea.  The subscription is
simple just post to Majordomo@mpgn.com the words subscribe traveller or
traveller-digest must be in the body of the e-mail.  The server should sent
them a message right away informing them they have been added to the list.
     It seems important to me for all the peoplle, who play any variant of
traveller, to be on this list so that we can help eachother improve the
traveller universe for everyone who plays.  It\'s the american way to throw
everything together into one pot and see what comes out of it.  I\'m not
saying we haven\'t produced some real stinkers, but for the most part it has
worked very well for everyone concerned.  The more people who have an imput
into the Traveller universe the better the better it will be.  If for
nothing else this allows people who do not have 10 or more years into
Traveller access to the minds and ideas of those of us who have.
     And this is my $.02 worth on this subject.

	GT _does_ have starship design.  In fact it is the simplest 
Traveller ship design system since High Guard.  It also includes several 
starship designs including *deckplans* for the Scout and Free Trader.  GT 
also _does_ have vehicles including their capabilities in much greater 
detail than Book 2.  What GT does _not_ have, admittedly, is a star 
system generator.  However, it does have a means to *describe* star 
systems and refs are free to make up systems using those stats.  No, it 
doesn\'t give dice ranges to roll, but most of us just fudged the rolls on 
or *homebrewed* world design anyway.  And isn\'t *homebrew* what you 
admired so much about the LBBs?
	For those of the Orthodox Traveller Faith, I know that nothing 
can ever rival the minimalist beauty of the LBBs, but GT is a great book 
that is well laid out; full of quality, Traveller appropriate art; and a 
delightful read.  If you believe, as I do, that Traveller is a rich 
background rather that a set of game mechanics, then you will have to 
admit that the Traveller background has never been so completely laid out 
between two covers.  That in itself makes it worth the cover price, IMHO.

I can\'t see how a ship arriving out of jump won\'t make a fair bit of noise.
The most obvious (to me, anyway) noise being the change in gravity
gradients and vectors within the system because a several thousand ton
object has just effectively been created out of nothing. I don\'t know how
the resulting gravity signal will be but I bet there\'ll be one.

Which missiles travel at MAch 2? Last I heard only the big Soviet ones did,
and most of those weren\'t really sea skimmers. Harpoon, Excocet etc are all
near supersonic.

I wouldn\'t say that medieval fortifications were \'easily\' taken by sapping
or blockade. Sapping was a tricky technique at best, and many castle walls
were built down onto bedrock. 

As for blockade - totally surrounding any descent castle was often
effectively impossible, especially a properly garrisoned one, as you have
to have sufficient strength availible in reserve to be able to stop a
breakout at any point on your perimeter. You also have the problem of
supplying your beseiging force (bear in mind that the defenders have
probably taken all the portable food into the castle and hidden or burned
the rest). To make matters even worse the beseigers were more likely to
suffer disease than the defenders because a castle did have some sort of
sanitary system whereas a military camp generally did not, and this taken
together with poor nutrition and dubious water supplies is a very good
breeding ground for nasty bugs.

Also later castles were designed with forse projection in mind, so not only
did you have to worry about relief forces you had to watch for attacks from
the castle itself.

There is still generally enough time to at least have a chance at hitting it
within that time frame...CIWS is an even better proposition, due to ROF (2000
rounds/min or better).  Even a Mk76 5" gun has a ROF of 1 every 3 seconds; not
much, but it has a much larger area of effect (burst radius).

As I recall, quick-firing 3" and 5" guns were developed in the late 1800\'s
specifically as an anti-torpedo and anti-torpedo boat defense.  My question
WRT the bay weapons stems from this in a way;  you would not normally do this,
but in a situation where you have 10 laser turrets, 10 repulsors, and 10 sand
turrets and there are 40 missiles incoming, isn\'t some chance better than
none?

Maybe there where alternatives or errata but:

In BR and Mayday, movement is traditional vector with a present
position counter, a past position and a predicted future position
- - which the player then changes by an amount up to their ship\'s
G rating.

In BL you have one counter on the board (which indicates facing)
plus others off the board on a ship chart to indicate current velocity
and facing (plus one to indicate if you are moving down hex edges and
another to indicate accumulated G if a heading change takes more than
one turn).
Then you have the rules to workout how long it takes to change heading
(at least just slowing down is easy).

The net result of all this confusion is less counters on the hex map
(pointless with half inch counters on a 2 inch hex) which is even more
odd when you consider that BL games are supposed to be single ship
actions (or at least small numbers) and BR is for fleet actions with
lots of ships.

Finally, in BR I can easilly see where everything is going (which is
precisely the sort of info that advanced computer displays can give
a starship captain) and in BL I cannot.

Oh my goodness. 

There were dozens of ironclads built during the Civil War, by both
sides. They ranged from the little CSS Manassas (sunk during the
Battle of New Orleans) to the massive USS New Ironsides and the twin
turreted monitors built late in the war.

USS Congress and USS Cumberland were sunk by CSS Virginia.

Due to her low freeboard, water rushed in through the engine air
intakes, put out the boilers, and rendered the ship unable to answer
her helm. Not to mention waves breaking over the turret...

Well the MK 86 GFCS(Gun FireControl System) using the Mk 45? five inch gun has
*good* chance of engaging a sea skimmer, if the mk 45 did not break down under
the high ROF, but CIWS has a better chance of all. 

Also the *common* variety of sea skimmers do not traveler at mach 2 skimming
the ocean. There is a former USSR missiles that travelled faster than Mach
2 at
about 100,000 feet, dropped like a spit ball over the target, upon impact it
had reduced speed to under mach 2. Early CIWS could not engage this type of
missile but projected later mods were supposed to be able to.

On the platforms(ships) that I served on, the MK 23 TAS radar was designed
just
for sea skimmers, and did it very well. Ohh but the feldercarb paperwork on
that damn thing when we were in US coastal waters...it seems that the FAA and
MK TAS were lets say "kissing close" on radar frequencies. When we had it
installed at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, we caused *problems* with LAX\'\'s FAA
radars, but only took them two weeks to locate us, and we were pier side all
that time. But every time we were in US coastal waters we had to submit our
*planned* steaming schedules then the FAA would tell us what frequencies we
could operate on if any.

By the way NEC\'s were for Improved Point Defense(NATO Seasparrow)(WC Sup), Mk
23 TAS(WC Sup), CIWS and Harpoon(WC Sup), secondary OJT\'s were Whirly-1?,
SLQ-32, Mk 86 and Sonar Dome Diver.

What I hear is that before, the bottlers were required to use cane or beet
sugar, and now they can use whatever is cheapest. In most places, that\'s corn
syrup, but in places like Hawaii, that\'s cane sugar, and in places like
Colorado and Louisiana it is beet sugar.

  Uh. Zhodani Module, page 3:
  "Zhdant has a population of 83 million, of whom more than 90% are racial
Zhodani. Significant non-Zhodani population is primarily Addaxur."


  When I did Tienspevnekr sector for HIWG five years ago (The Tienspevnekr
writeup on the HIWG CD is mine), that line led to my placing Addaxur
worlds and populations all over the sector. I KNOW where all of the
original Addaxur worlds are, and where the "reservation" is now...

...but I still don\'t know what they look like. I was sort of aiming
at a multi-legged reptiloid hyena, but the concept faded. I maintain
that the vast majority are low-slung and positively cheerful.
"Happy carnivores."

 The Addaxur were the Zhodani\'s first real First Contact situation. The
Zho passed the test with flying colors for two reasons: they and the
Addaxur really are compatible, and the Zhodani spent years watching the
Addaxur before speaking to them. This set of techniques works sometimes,
and has utterly failed at others (thus generating library data, hee hee)

 The Addaxur Reservation is a true sovereign state by ancient pact and
tradition. "Reservation" does not carry the same stigma that is attached
to what we Yanks did/are doing/will do to the American Indians. Many of
the worlds of the old Addaxur "Empire" still have Addaxur on them. The
Zhodani did not deport them 5000 years ago, and have not discouraged
Addaxur immigrants since then.

If I may offer a piece of advice...

Matt Clonfero has been honing his knowledge of modern naval weapons for
_years_ as, among other things, a regular participant in the
sci.military.naval newsgroup.  Don\'t expect to sharpshoot him.

Concerning Mach 2 sea-skimmers, try SS-N-22 (NATO codename: SUNBURN) on
for size....

ObTrav:  As a tactical problem, what would be the late-20th-century
analogue to the standard 6G det-laser missile?  How much more
performance would be needed to equate to SUNBURN, and how much more
damage potential would be needed to equate to SHIPWRECK (an apt NATO
codename if ever there was one...)?

commenting on something that you are ill-informed about. You have also made
it abundantly clear that you don\'t like GURPS. I can handle a matter of

Don\'t know about Che, I suspect you\'re exaggerating about the BPs and RBs ...
but you are DEAD WRONG about Malaya ...

Assuming you are talking about the Malayan Insurgency?

The Communist Party of Malaya was close to 100% ethnic chinese. The population
of rural Malaya is close to 100% ethnic malay (or non-chinese, anyhow).

The British and Australians used the natural antipathy between the two (which
still exists between Chinese and Malays in Malaysia, and between Malaysia and
ethnic-chinese dominated Singapore) to hunt down and destroy the Malaysian
Insurgents.

The MCP gained no support from the people amongst whom it was *supposed* to be
hiding a la Mao\'s tenets. Or so close to none that it doesn\'t matter.

So, you are *wrong* in saying the MCP had "substantial" support.

Ahh... so the problem is (and quite legitimately) that those who cannot do
this on the fly spend ages working out their assets.  This has not so far
proved a problem, but i can see that it might.

Too true, the wonders of reliable engines finally bring about a reduction
in the reliance on sail, and finally make it redundant.  Before then you
need the Wind Gauge, and to get that you need to be lucky and or Brilliant.

Well, I haven\'t used any ship combat rules more recent than High Guard. I
don\'t know how the newest detection ranges work out. I understand that
they are far more realistic than the earlier rules (Frankly, I think that
detection ranges is an instance where it was a mistake to go for more
realism  --  IMO it detracts from playability). But anyway, if you play
shortish detection ranges, scout vessels can jump in outside detection 
range and coast closer to whatever they want to observe. But even if
you play with realistic detection ranges, scouts can jump into a system.
They will be detected, but if they are far away from where the defenders
are stationed and move about all the time, there\'s not much the defenders
can do about it, except curse.

Boxes raise the cost of a game by a lot -- also, bookstores don\'t like 
carrying boxes.

The only company I\'ve seen recently that\'s done a product like this is 
Rubicon Games; they\'ve done a few half-folded booklets for about $10.  
They are adventures and only sold through mail-order.

Yeah, but enough people do that it is a viable option for people on a 
budget.  Realistically, given a set of players at least one of them will 
have access to the Internet, either via a school, a public library, or an 
AOL account.

Actually, there\'s been some talk of printing up a bunch of copies of 
GURPS Lite and selling them cheaply or giving them away.  My roommate 
actually did that when he and I were running the SJ Games booth down at 
Gateway con in LA a few weeks ago.

	To some extent, I find even those discussion useful WHEN

	1) They\'re civil. Each side recognizes the other\'s basic right to

	PGP 2.6.2 PGPDOC2.TXT:

	"... PGP "bootstraps" into a conventional single-key encryption
algorithm by using a public key algorithm to encipher the
conventional session key and then switching to fast conventional
cryptography.  So let\'s talk about this conventional encryption
algorithm.  It isn\'t the DES. ... PGP does not use the DES as its
conventional single-key algorithm to encrypt messages.  Instead, PGP
uses a different conventional single-key block encryption algorithm,
called IDEA(tm)."

	Also, "Applied Cryptography, 2ed," by Bruce Schneier, p33

	"In the real world, public-key algorithms are not a substitute for
symmetric algorithms. They are not used to encrypt messages, they are
used to encrypt keys. There are two reasons for this:

	"1. Public-key algorithms are slow. Symmetric algorithms are
generally at least 1000 times faster than public-key algorithms. ...

	"2. Public-key cryptosystems are vulnerable to chosen-plaintext
attacks. ..."

	IIRC, the IDEA session key is 128 bits. Public keypairs are usually
1024 or more bits, significantly longer than the IDEA key.

	As for the statement that the NSA has claimed they can crack
PGP--while I haven\'t paid much attention, I don\'t recall hearing that
anywhere. I\'ve no doubt they can crack a small key; while I wouldn\'t
be surprised if they can crack larger ones, neither would I leap to
believe it.

	Well, I wouldn\'t have the transponder _completely_ disintigrate ...
just the critical portion needed to continue identifying itself as
valid. The ship\'s history would be burned into read-only forge proof
(I mean resistant ...) storage. The Lady would be escorted to the
starport, where they would pull up this memory, authenticate it, and
depending on the contents determine how much hassle to give the guy.
A new transponder might have to be shipped in from the nearest class
A starport.

	IMTU, the transponder functions as (a) tracking aide for system
control, (b) identification and registration for the ship (*near*
unforgeable), and (c) flight data recorder. Key information gets
added to read-only memory, such as ownership, crew data, flight
history, and ships logs. The transponder also maintains "circular"
history of information that only becomes important under certain
circumstances, in which case it gets dumped to permanent storage as
well.

	For example, commo traffic gets stored and then overwritten ...
unless a "Mayday" or "Signal GK" is received, in which case the last
time period gets saved. Next time you call at a class C or above
starport, they\'re going to see that and you better be able to either
prove you responded as required, or justify why not. ALL ships
receiving a distress call are required to respond.

	Likewise, sensor data is routed through a circular buffer. But if
you fire your weapons, the most recent data gets saved again AND the
transponder adds a special code to your signal. The next IN patrol or
customs ship will use that sensor data and other information to
determine if you really were attacked by a pirate, or were actually
trying to pull a little armed robbery yourself.

	Flight history is recorded both whenever you set down at any class A
or B, and some C starports, as well as from jump settings. The
transponder saves all those to permanent storage, and it\'s possible
to reconstruct where you\'ve been based on a known starting point, and
the jump settings used.

	(Before some of you flame me ... IMTU means "In MY Traveller
Universe" ... and no, I still don\'t think it\'s got the feel of some
Big Brother Orwellian reality. There\'s still room for rats at the
wainscoting of society ... steel rats).

	Great ... now fifty years from now the corn syrup lobbyists will
have artificially inflated the price of corn syrup, and Coca Cola
will come out with Improved Coke, and then will back down in a wave
of public protest and bring back Original Coke, only they\'ll secretly

Why would anyone buy a game supplement before buying the core rules? When you
buy/bought any version of _Traveller_, you bought a complete game and was
entitled to expect a complete game. When you buy GURPS:Traveller you are
buying a setting for the GURPS rules and can\'t expect them to reprint scads
of rules that are already found elsewhere. A little overlap is of course
permissible, even commendable, but if the G:T rules contained too much
duplicated material, then those who DID have a lot of GURPS stuff lying
around would have a legitimate complaint.

I haven\'t seen G:T yet, but I have GURPS:Basic and GURPS:Space. With those
two I could homebrew something even without G:T ;-)

Simple: astrographic and orbital data can be gathered from several parsecs
away (AM1 aslan, IIRC). Jump in in such a manner that your exit sig is
blocked by a large body. Putting a planet between you and the monitoring
world would seem to be the most effective... and, based upon the ability to
garner number of planets, and orbital periods beforehand, as well as rather
exact distances, you could plot and time adjust your jump to put you in a
blind spot behind an inner system body, assuming they don\'t have monitoring
around all inner system worlds. Which, more than likely, they don\'t if the
worlds are not inhabited. Recon is dangerous, but possible.

HEPlaR is a high temp fusion plant exhaust rocket. with the delta v\'s
generated for the fuel used, it has to be high energy, which also means
(usually) high RF sig.

Look if you don\'t like the GURPS system there are still plenty other versions
of Traveller out there.

So enough with the LBB\'s and the "stand alones". 

You\'ll be arguing forever.

If you don\'t like the GURPS system don\'t use it!!!

If you prefer CT, MT, T:TNE or T4 , more power to you. 

I myself love the Traveller background,
It\'s just no matter how "good" a game system is , someone somewhere is going
to find something wrong with it.

Traveller history shows that it takes the 3rd Imperium 300-400 years per
step to get from TL 12 to 15 (but 15 to 16 apparently only takes a bit
more than a century). There are two possible explanations for the rapid
advancement of technology on Terra from TL 4 to 9. Either each TL
advancement usually takes centuries and the spurt on Terra is a freak
occurrence or the advancement to TL 9 is ordinary enough, but hits some
sort of "wall" when you get to TL 10 or thereabouts. In either case the
darrian advancement from TL 3 to TL 16 in four centuries is a freak.

Mind you, no one is claiming that this is a realistic view of how things
will work in the Real World. But it is the way things work in the TU.

This is similar, but not identical, to what GURPS Traveller uses.

Yikes! Lots of counters. I guess you\'d need a large play area for both the
map AND the record sheets.

GURPS Traveller also presents a vector-movement combat system. The system
produces the same effects as a full vector system like Battlefleet
Mars, Mayday or Book 2, but through the concept of a placeholder counter
that is removed after each ship\'s movement reduces counter clutter to
only two per ship.

Rob, I agree with you about this, generally, but like with most
things some people take the "flawed character" bit too far.  

You don\'t have to make your character a misanthropist with a bum
leg, an overpowering clastrophobia, and a massive chip on their
should for him/her to be interesting.  I had a player that did that
in a recent game.  Yes, he did a good job of playing the character,
but his character was NOT fun for the other characters to be
around, and was a drag on everyone\'s fun...*except* the guy running
him.  He appeared to get his jollys by blocking everyone else.
That\'s not mature play...so it isn\'t taking disadvantages that makes
for mature gamers, which, of course, you *didn\'t* say. ;->

What I most agree with is your final few words "...for the fun of
it, without the prod of game points."

My philosophy is that you should play a character that is
interesting to you and the other players...that is FUN.  Give the
character flaws, sure, but always end up with someone you\'d want to
hang out with...flaws and all.  A character that, not only can YOU
have fun with, but that will be fun for all the other players to
play with.

I tell new would-be players that role playing games are mostly about
playing a role, and staying in character, but that they are games
too...and like any good game you can win.  The way to "win" is to
entertain *everybody*, to make the game interesting and exciting for
everybody involved.  The player and character that does that is a
winner.  Oh, and before anyone jumps on the "winning" aspect I also
explain that rpg\'s are both a team game and a non-zero sum
game...meaning *everybody*, including the GM, wins when we all play
well.  ;->

I grew up on beet sugar.  There\'s a slightly different taste to it than cane 
sugar.  And beet sugar\'s all through the West; Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico, etc.

He is wrong about Che also.  Che tried to start a revolt in Bolivia and he
was turned in by the peasants he was trying to raise.

The government had instituted land reform and Che got sold out quickly.

The burden to prove or disprove is irrelevant. A conflict in the canon
demonstrably exists. Forgable transponders are *Official* whether you like
it or not. The forgable transponder is presented as a given factor. How
believable the Deyo chip is in itself is irrelevant (My own belief that
the story is internally inconsistent comes not from the pseudo-science
babble, but from my opinion about sovereign governments that allow rival
governments to install black boxes in all their shipping, foreign and
domestic).

No you don\'t. You\'re perfectly willing to discard forgable transponders.
You just want to keep the bits that you like and get rid of the bits you
don\'t like. Nothing wrong with that. I want exactly the same. What ticks
me off is that you want to pretend that your version is the only possible
one and that anyone who try to get rid of your bits is a silly fool while
you are a selfless, pure-spirited, objective defender of the One True Way.
I\'m also not too fond of your attitude that any material that contradicts
your preferred interpretation is somehow inferior to the bits that agree
with you.

I have it (updated with all of Jo Grant\'s additional sectors). If you want I\'ll
zip it up and send it to you. I can break it into disk sized chunks if that

It is my belief that a pirate ship would have trouble capturing enough
booty to support itself (depending on your assumptions about the value
the average cargo and a lot of other factors, of course). Adding a
\'tender\' will increase that problem.

You mean a SJ Board, like the playtest boards?  Loren, I sure wish I
could download those messages, read and write my replys off line and
upload replies.  The way they are set up over there, they are a
regular pain...so much of a pain I didn\'t participate much at all.

Set up a real, honest to goodness, mailing list, or send them here.
That\'s my suggestion.

Vain hope, that! ;->

I enjoy system discussions, as long as they stay civil and don\'t
degrade into flame-wars.  Personally, I\'d like to see the GURPS
system cross-pollinate with all the Traveller systems.  What comes
out might be a "best of breed."

  The arachnid leg structure is not well suited to high-G, IIRC.
I also have a bias against sentient spiders in the region thanks
to Chuck Kallenbach, with the Sred\'ni in The Beyond. Someone
suggested to me the last time this came up that the Addaxur
might be rather turtle-like and be scavengers. The idea has more
appeal to me than yet another lizard-man. If GTs Addaxur are
proportioned like your typical Tolkien Dwarf (ie. short and WIDE),
I can probably cope, but heavy gravity and bipedal forms just don\'t
mix well...

 Here\'s some of what I have...

 LIBRARY DATA (TIENSPEVNEKR SECTOR; excerpts):

 Abrr Subsector (Tienspevnekr G):
    Contains the Addaxur Reservation. The original name for the
subsector as the Zhodani explored was Tsachi.  After the Addaxur
were discovered, the name for the region became Abrr ("Surprise").
The Council Seat retains the original name.

 Addaxur:
    While many Addaxur live within the ten world Reservation, members
of this race can be found anywhere in the Consulate.  The Addaxur
lend a unique quality to the culture of Zhodani worlds they inhabit.
Any world with a significant population of Addaxur will have an "X#"
note in its comments.  The number ranges from zero to nine, each
digit representing 10% of the total world population.  Thus "X4"
indicates that about 40% of the population is Addaxur.  The Addaxur
consider Zhodani a comfortable presense, and there are very few
worlds beyond the Reservation which are totally Addaxur.  These rare
worlds are labeled as the Reservation is: "Ax".

 Addaxur Reservation:
    The Addaxur have a ten world reservation in Abrr subsector. They
rule these worlds absolutely, with no interference from the Consulate.
Only one world has any steady Zhodani presence.  Addax, the
reservation capital (and Addaxur homeworld) has a joint Navy base.
The Consulate has gone to great lengths to keep interference to a
minimum. While the Addaxur have been an integral part of the central
Consulate for over 5000 years, and can be seen in nearly every
corner of Zhodani space, they continue to hold their homeworlds in
relative isolation from the Zhodani.  Except for Addax, the worlds of
the reservation are off-limits to outsiders, and Consulate citizens
may visit them only with an invitation.

  I thought that we\'d worked through those issues already? :) If the Virginia

what can you say about the three Northern fleet units that it had gutted the
day before, and their failure to significantly affect their foe?

Two things:
Do you know where I can look at a copy of this?

A big concern of mine is that such a system be fully integrated into the BL
equivalent, for T5 (indeed for TNE which I play, I would want to be able to
fully integrate it)  BL and BR (with fixes for meson guns) did this nicely
at another level.

Easy. If it\'s alone, it jumps out and reports the location of the pirate
ship to the nearest concentration of forces - military ships would have
good enough sensors to see our hypothetical 4000t pirate outside combat
range. If it has a companion, the junior captain jumps out, while the
senior captain announces \'Medals all round, chaps\' and closes to engage. In
the greater scheme of things, it doesnt matter if the Patrol Frigate gets
fried, but any sort of damage will cause the raider problems.

Next, lets have a look at the ecology of a 4000 ton pirate ship.

If it\'s a Vargr ship, a Vargr with enough charisma can probably get it
built via public subscription (\' Argavid says Join the Gnasher Supporters
Club, and help Argavid show those Imperials What ... loot, booty,
*charisma* awaits\').

If it isnt, someone is going to have to come up with a gigacredit or so, or
a State that is prepared to risk Imperial retaliation while either someone
walks off with one of their light cruisers, or operates pirate support
infrastructure on their turf.

If it\'s a mutineer ship, I need convincing that going to some neutral State
and selling them the ship isnt a better option (Federation of Arden and the
Sword Worlds come immediatly to mind ... either or both could buy it off
the mutineers at 10% of value).

OK, so we have our pirate ship. How much tonnage in ships does it need to
capture each year to pay for food, supplies, expendables and annual
maintainence, plus crew salaries for the ship, any secret support bases and
any supporting merchant ships ?

Is this number higher than that which would attract Imperial attention, or
force the Hortalez et Cie Subsector Director to declare the subsector \'held
covered\' - that insurance contracts will be paid out only for ships
travelling in 8 ship or greater convoys, with 1 escort of 400 dtons per 8
ships ? Captains may also consider jacking up their freight rates on
account of the \'help covered\' status (aka \'Lets Amber Zone the subsector
due to pirate activity\'), and install enough fuel bladders for an emergency
jump-1.

Imperial attention is worse. Hunting down pirates is (in my opinion)
excellent practice for the wartime duty of hunting down commerce raiders,
so it\'s a great way to hold an impromptu fleet excersise.

Pirating ships on outbound legs is difficult, as they may choose to risk
misjump by jumping within 100 diameters, and traffic control presumably
routes outbound ships well apart. Pirating ships on inbound legs requires
hanging around within sensor ranges of the planet. This tends to make
people curious, especially if you dont have a valid sensor signal, and
arent prepared to answer signals.

If the planet cant afford SDBs, they can either make a deal with a friendly
neighbourhood megacorp (trading rights to customs revenue and starship
operation for an agreed level of military protection), or find some IISS
Detatched Duty Scout, spend a couple of megacredits up-arming her Type S,
and *voila* ... instant Customs Patrol. Heck, they\'ll probably take local
kids up for the ride, show em what they know, and write a nice letter of
reference for the IISS recruiters. It\'s a good way off a iceball ...

No anomolies ? No-one notices a ship that sells cargos, but never seems to
buy them ? Especially when ships have been disappearing ?

While you are figuring the economic level of activity for the pirate,
remember to add in the time lost travelling to and from the rendezvous.

I\'d really, really like to see some hard numbers that favour the pirates.

To be fair, a lot of good roleplaying stuff has come out of the Great
Piracy Debate of 1997-8 - I am thinking of Walt Smith\'s stuff in
particular. His first-person interview of the emigre noble, still fighting
the Revolution from his light cruiser-turned-pirate was brilliant, IMO. I
might take up the cudgels in favour of the pirate-chasers at most
opportunities, but I respect people who make a workable case for piracy :)

The occasional economics debates are needed IMO - the economics and trade
rules in most of Traveller are very, very badly broken, and this annoys me
at least - I think Trav should be not only have a hard(ish) science
background, but also hard(ish) social science background.

misunderstanding of what GT is for.

GURPS sourcebooks have two primary audiences:
1) Players/refs who already play GURPS and want to expand their campaigns.
This group is well served by GT because GT nicely describes the Third
Imperium, its history, organization, technology, starships, types of
characters and campaigns. Vehicle design rules are not included because
GURPS already has a set of vehicle rules (VEHICLES). Psionics are not
covered because they are in the basic rulebook (more complete rules for Psi
than appeared in *all* Traveller rulesets and supplements until T4\'s
Psionic Institutes); thoroughly complete rules are in GURPS PSIONICS.
System creation, planetary mapping, and exotic environment rules were
published a decade ago in the award-winning SPACE. To repeat these rules in
GT would not be well received by existing GURPS players.

2) Refs/players who use another RPG system and want to expand their campaigns.
This audience (which is probably larger than the first) is also well served
by GT because GT nicely describes the Third Imperium, its history,
organization, technology, starships, types of characters and campaigns. The
system they are using (Fading Suns, Alternity, Trinity, Space Opera, Star
Wars, etc.) presumably includes rules for character creation, combat,
psionics, vehicles, and planet design. Even pre-existing Traveller players
will find GT to be of use. It\'s the best one-volume explanation of the
Traveller campaign setting ever printed, and it\'s the *only* in-print
source of information for the classic c. 1100 Traveller setting.

GT was never intended as a standalone game. GURPS Traveller is intended as
a supplement for, you guessed it, GURPS.  That\'s why it\'s called "GURPS
Traveller" and not "Traveller". The standalone version is TRAVELLER 4th
Edition, published by Imperium Games (corporate motto: "Traveller players
are so stupid they\'ll buy ANYTHING!"). GT was established as a way of
expanding the Traveller audience (to GURPS players) as well as creating an
alternate rules set for players who might want to use it. It is very
similar to White Wolf\'s licensing of their Vampire/Werewolf/Mage games to
GURPS. Somehow, Vampire players were able to figure out that GURPS Vampire
was not a standalone game (the standalone game was called Vampire and it
was sold by White Wolf) - why can\'t certain Traveller players?

GT was also never intended as an introductory game. GURPS is very
intentionally positioned as an \'advanced\' role-playing system, presuming a
certain level of experience from its referees and players. Note the lack of
"What is Roleplaying" or "How to be a good referee" chapters or
introductory adventures in the core rulebook. Compare to Basic D&D and Star
Wars, which are aimed at newly-minted RPGers.

To criticise GT for missing features present in other GURPS books, not
being standalone, or not catering to new RPGers is to miss the point
completely.

(I also wonder at those who claim that GT is not really Traveller because
it doesn\'t feel like proper Traveller mechanics. I can only ask: which
ones? There were at least *5* different and largely incompatable sets of
traditional mechanics for Traveller, not to mention the changes in the
basic assumptions of the game universe (AI, Heplar, Fusion+, jump torps,
max ship size, etc.))

<No, I can\'t!>

Oh well, I was *really* trying to ignore the semi-annual technology debate.

But I *really* can\'t let this one go.

It is made fairly plain in all the material on the Vilani that they were
*incredibly* conservative ... worse than the Chinese, in fact, and that this was
the reason for the slowness of their technological advance.

It is also fairly plain that the Terrans (and it was Terrans who made the
Darrian experience possible) are *not* as hidebound.

The strong implication is that the Terrans were swamped by the Vilani - socially
and culturally if not racially - just like the Chinese did for their invaders.

You may disagree with this assessment (and I know a lot do!), but I think the
evidence is certainly suggestive ... the Terrans advance (relatively speaking)
explosively *until* they "win" the Nth Interstellar war. Or, more accurately,
until Admiral Estigaribbia stages his coup that crushes Terran independence and
inventiveness in favour of becoming a Vilani Cultural Puppet <grin> (yes, that
was a *deliberate* red rag ... any bulls out there?) ... well, he certainly
*does* crush terran independence, and, *I* think it is obvious that he crushes
their inventiveness, too.

The ROM is scientifically stagnant as a result (ignoring the highly debatable
implications some people have tried to put on T4 stuff referring to the ROM,
which, maybe, shouldn\'t be ignored ... take your pick).

The 3I is *certainly* stagnant *in comparative terms* to the pre-ROM terrans,
but better than the 1st Empire.

Where would "we" be if Estigaribbia had not staged his coup? Or if it had been
defeated? If the Terrans had forced the Vilani to measure up to *our* standards
rather than being strangled by the dead hand of Vilani conservatism.

I have my opinions, which I know you disagree with ... but its interesting to
speculate.

Of course, the *real* truth is that the whole thing was a plot by Grandfather!
he *knew* that the Terrans would, if left unchecked, "soon" (we\'re talking
someone at least 250,000 years old, remember!) be a technological nuisance,
perhaps even a threat, to him ... so he manipulated things (an earlier version
of psychohistory) to get Estigaribbia to stage his coup.

In fact, if the truth be known, the reason Estigaribbia died without issue is
because he was actually a cunningly designed android/clone/biological robot
placed in that position *by* Grandfather! (Well, prove he wasn\'t! <grin>)

>Mind you, no one is claiming that this is a realistic view of how things
>will work in the Real World. But it is the way things work in the TU.

So you have to figure out why. And my explanation is at least based on some
historical experience that makes sense. Not the only explanation, of course

The "Monitor", for example, carried essentially the largest guns made in
the period, and was clearly designed with fighting other ironclads in
mind; it was still incapable of penetrating the "Virgina"\'s armour. 
Armour had advanced past gunnery by a large margin, until later inovations
(armour-piercing shells, rifled guns) adjusted the balance.

Perhaps its just a difference in perspective between Charles and me...
Anyone who\'s unwilling to admit that defence had outstripped offsense in
(for example) the middle years of WWI must have a flexible set of 
definitions. Similarly, in modern cryptography, if it takes weeks or months
of effort by massively parallel large-scale government computers to brake
encryption that runs in milliseconds on an elderly PC or workstation, I would
say that encryption is ahead (particularly when one considers ideas such
as rapid key changes, longer keys, etc.) It\'s not *perfect*, but it\'s
way, way, way ahead.

Okay now Im not disputing you on encryption, but there has to be two very 
important cavets to the action off Hampton Roads. Firstly the Monitor\'s guns 
were totally untested and she was only allowed to use 15 pounds of powder per 
shot (this is a _very_ light charge for her 11 inch SB guns). Secondly the 
Virgina (ex-Merrimack) only fired shell throughout the engagement. It is quite 
likely that there would have been a very different result if either of these factors 
had been different.

In FFS2, passive sensors do indeed reach farther than active sensors, which 
makes physical sense...although active sensors are harder to hide from.

This doesn\'t explain why the various Terran/Solomani states (which weren\'t
swamped by Vilani, being outside the first Imperium\'s old borders) in the
long night and early 3I periods didn\'t outstrip the Syleans and the Third
Imperium technologically. Nor does this explain how the 3I managed to stay
in front of the Solomani Confederation during the later part of its
membership in the Imperium and its seperation.

Its from GURPS Vehicles. To me its annoying and would probably change a 
few minor points in the background as well; but its not that serious. In TNE and 
T4 most fusion plants carried 1 years fuel (the fuel glupping fusion plants of CT 
and MT are just plain silly), but the limitation on STL were 1) supplies (you still 
have to eat) and 2) the 1000 diameter threshold for thrusters. As long as these 
factors have are still constant there\'s no real change to the background. No 
more annoying than the loss of fusion guns and repulsors.

Since, until the tiff between ADB and TFG is resolved, there is no
production of SFB... don\'t hold your breath.
ADB writes and owns the copyrights.
TFG publishes under exclusive liscence and sells to distributers.
TFG has failed to pay ADB for over a year on products already sold.
ADB won\'t make more til they get paid or TFG gives up the exclusive
printing/distribution rights.
TFG won\'t pay til they get more product.

==========================================
Aye, tis a sad state of affairs.  So in the meantime, I\'m writing my own 
version, a merging of what I feel are the best concepts of SFB, 
StarFire, and some other things, into my own game system.  Anyone care 
to get involved?  I\'m planning to make it available for free.  And 
trying to arrange it so it doesn\'t interfere with ADB and TFG\'s 
copyrights.  We can discuss this between ourselves, or If there is 
enough interest, I can set up an egroup for us.  Lemme know!

None of us are attempting to assert that there were periods in which there
were perfect defences that couldn\'t be beaten by any imaginable force under
any imaginable circumstances - just that there were periods in which 
defence was (significantly) ahead, so that given balanced cost/resources/
forces/etc. attacks would have little effect (infantry in WWI, 
guns vs ironclads, NSA vs PGP) unless the attacker could expend 
significantly higher resources.

Well, one could argue that the amount of time it takes to advance by one
TL is proportional to the amount of people making the change... The
Vilani
got to TL 9 or 10 probably as quickly as Terra did, but then they
started 
expanding, which makes it harder to advance en masse.

I think the TL 15 -> TL 16 thing around 1120 (or whenever G:T is set) is 
due to a few pockets of TL 16 technology arising in combination with
the reasonably well-developed communications network present in the 3I.

The First Imperium had to contend with subjugating minor races, long
travel
times and a rapidly growing population base, all of which make it
difficult
to chuck out all your crappy old equipment in favour of new stuff.

The Terrans, during the Interstellar Wars, advanced relatively rapidly
to TL
12 or so (don\'t start that old flame war again!!!). Most societies
caught up
in large wars tend to accelerate their technological advancement, as
things
are getting replaced all the time due to damage anyway.

I don\'t think it\'s horribly unrealistic.

Phil! What\'s with the persecution complex? Your explanation suits me
fine.

Now, I think the Vilani have legitimate reasons for being
technologically 
conservative and that it\'s not just some wierd, arbitrary cultural value
they picked off a table in the \'World Builder\'s Handbook\', but aside
from
that, it\'s a perfectly fine, reasonable explanation.

  Probably - even a small warship can deploy fighters to function as
forward elements in its\' own miniature task force/escort array. Even
worse, you probably can design remote laser drones (a la 2300 AD) or
KKMs (or EMP or fixed plasma rounds) warheads.

  The latter option would certainly complicate things, and might lead
to an equilibrium where missiles become a strike density augmentation
system that has to be deployed fairly close to its\' nuke-det activation
range, or that can only effectively engage the outer layer of a defense
structure in a given strike.

  Not that complication is inherently bad, mind you :)

Pocket Empires gives standard times for raising TL.  Rising from 4 to 8 is
indeed rapid (and cheap!), but each step above that requires massive
amounts of time and investment.

To be honest, Emperor\'s Vehicles was one of the biggest failures of T4.
The lack of Tech Levels for each vehicle was a killer.

So? As a player of mine once showed me, give the character a 14DX and a
14IQ, then take 56 half-point skills. That\'s a load of skills at better

I understand that but what is the relationship between TL and computational
power?  In GURPS it\'s an order of magnatude (x10) but I have not seen this
related in traveller or any other game in this way.

I was thinking Vargr pirates.  You are right about unsupported pirates being
good target pratic for the local navy.  They can only run so far so fast but
with a border to cross...

Well they could grab a big merchant or two and have all that much more to
sell.  One or two week of piracy before the sell of would work.  It takes
time for the Navy to hear about the problem and they would have one of those
Navy transponders to hide behind.

How many loads of say a 4000 ton freighter filled with computer chips would
it take?  ONE!  Part of being a sucessfull pirate is intel on the goods.
Spies in ships departments ect.  Vargr are known for this.  See the
Traveller adventure.  A pirate is a great cover for an inside job.

As for how many ships are lost in a sector before problems begin?  That
depends on traffic.  In the city near where I work there are fatal criminal
attacks on a weekly basis.  It \'par\' for this city.  Have they insituted
martial law?  No.  The insurence rates have gone up but thats about it.  In
most places where there are insurence companies they are required to offer
insurence to all.  It\'s the rates that change and even those have caps set
by law.

Very true.  \'YIPE! Imps!  Jump for the border boys! Fast!\'

A pirate inside 100 dia. is toast.  A pirate that has not got his H2 tanks
full and a ploted jump deserves to be toast.

You need spies and inside help.  That what you use to make it profitable and
lower the risk.  See TA.  Also you use astological bodies to hide behind.

The legal ship cross the border.  As for always selling that would be a dead
give away.  The legal ship does bussiness a usual...he just supliment his
cargo with stollen goods and sell them far from the attack.  One ship would
be hard press to do this for one successful pirate but 10 merchants...  Have
you ever heard of organised crime.  One military transponder and the pirate
can disappear and move far away as the SS Gaurdian defender of the Vargr
Express Trading Co.  While the merchant ship take the boot back to the Extences.

True.  The role playing is the fun of it.

One of my favorite characters was a mountain man guide saddled with a group
of very young knights in a fantacy adventure world.  The knights were loaded
with knightly disadvantage, Vows, Duties, Codes, all required by their
knightly orders.  My guide had only bad temper (A surly old coot), blood
lust, (he NEVER forgave or forgot), and intolerence to tenderfeet (including
his charges).  His intolerence took the form of pratical jokes like NOT
mentioning that a given knight was making his bed in a poison ivy patch.
The guide was the only one with any survival skills.  He was not much of a
combatant though.  Short sword, knife, and bow and \'light leather armor\' in
the form of his homemade skin clothes.

Things got interesting when the \'damsel in distress\' turned out to be a
runaway brat with magery and our only mage.  The GM ruled that my guide had
little experence with the opposite sex except for those you pay for...  The
young knights had no experience with any female except court ladies and

All true, but it the castle force attacked you outside the castle they lost
the benefit of the defensive position and had to attack your defesive
postions arround the castle.  They would loose more men that the attackers
and not have these men to defeand the walls.  I see this as a valid tactic
only if:

1)  The attacker does not have enough men to take the castle.

2)  An outside force is attacking the attacker flank at the same time.

3)  As a last ditch attempt to escape a castle doomed to fall.

I have no dought that these thing are true today in a world where the
greatess distance travellable can have records sent in minutes.  What happen
when getting a record from \'next door\' takes two week?  What about a
wandering ship that is from two sector away?  It may take a year to get any
responce and two or three years to get a complete responce.

And said Gnasher can be vaporised by the colition of my scout ship moving at
.9c.  What\'s the point?  With the tech available to the average ship it\'s
posible to devistate a hemisphere.  

The merchant ship just refuses and jumps out.  If the IN hold the ship,
charge them for your time and expence.  There has to be consiquences built
into the system for abuse of power and wrongfull impressionmant or else each
ship\'s captain would be kidnapping local girls for their own use.  

Where are the lines drawn?  What is going to far?  What happens when the
captain of that merchant ship is the empirer\'s cozen?  Or that girl is the
govener\'s little girl?  Where is the uniform code of military justice?
Where is the basis for military disciplen?

If the IN run rough shod over the civilians they will fine the cost of
shiping their supplies going through the roof and someone up the line will
start to ask questions about them.  Bother the MM long enough and you end up
having to ship your own goods.  Remeber the MM is a power unto themselves in
the TU.  They have infuence of their own.  Are there any canon sources
dealing with these situations?  What are the laws of the empire?  In theory
and pratice as they are not always the same.

the Imperium_, with an eye towards economic viability - as someone
said, these ships wouldn\'t exist unless someone was building them,
and they wouldn\'t be built unless someone was making money with
them.

I ran the numbers with the following assumptions:
- ----

1> Crew is getting standard salaries, no bonuses for higher skill levels.
2> Crew consists of Pilot, Navigator, Medic, three Engineers,
     Steward, and Gunner. The Medic, Steward, and/or an Engineer
     can take on a gun turret as needed.
3> The ship is buying refined fuel at every stop, enough to fill the
     jump fuel tanks and half-fill the power plant tanks.
4> The ship must pay for shuttle service at each port of call, at the
     rate of Cr10 per ton of cargo transported each way.
5> The ship is running with a full load of cargo and passengers.
- ----

Note that #3 may not be necessary if the ship can use unrefined fuel
and skim a gas giant - as it may be an ex-military (or paramilitary)
ship, it may have this capability as a Scout Ship does.

Note that #4 may be an unnecessary expense, many highports have
cargo waiting in orbit, or factors willing to pay the shuttle fee.

I admit that #5 is an assumption in favor of the crew, it should balance
out other assumptions made against them. If the ship intends to do
Trading instead of just freight hauling, it should probably give up the
two high passengers it can carry in favor of a couple trade specialists.
If it decides to try it\'s hand at Exploratory Trade (a job it\'s pretty well
suited for), it will probably want to carry another gunner and either
a scientist or a trade specialist.
- ----

Some miscellanous bits:
- ----

Where did the ship originally come from?

As I\'ve mentioned before, there are some things that aren\'t efficient
on the 400-ton Corsair. Why three hardpoints instead of four? Why
unstreamlined, but with no small craft or vehicles?

As the numbers will show, the Corsair isn\'t a purpose-built trade
vessel, at least not originally. There\'s simply no way to make the
economics numbers work out (as I will show). IMO, the Corsair
is a used, modified scout or patrol vessel turned over to civilian
hands through auction or other means.

I designed a Patrol Scout on a 300-ton hull, with the fuel and drives
to provide jump-2, 3G performance even if something (like a cargo
pod or mission module) bumped the displacement up to 400-tons.
This was one possibility - it would be an older design, perhaps a
precursor to the familiar 400tn Type-T Patrol Cruiser from CT.
This would explain the missing hardpoint, and would give the ship
an excuse to have military-grade (if outdated) sensors, and would have
been designed to use a variable-signal military transponder. Even
if that transponder were removed, or otherwise demilitarized,
it should be easier to get a (stolen?) military transponder working
in this ship than it would be in a civilian vessel. 

Another possibility is that the Corsair is simply a multirole ship,
and part of that cargo bay (that can swallow a 100 ton ship,
remember) was originally designed as a hangar for a Pinnace or
Ship\'s Boat. The missing hardpoint would have to be explained as
a design limit, especially if this is not designed as a purely combat
vessel - the Fat Trader only has half as many hardpoints as it could
have, for example. If the Corsair is a multirole ship, it could be either
military or civilian - a fleet auxiliary or armed merchant.

In either case, I see this ship as a used starship, aging and somewhat
outdated.

- ----

On to the analysis.

The build price of the ship comes to MCr175.6.  _Citizens of the Imperium_
places it\'s value at "about MCr180", which is either a rounded figure
or includes the modifications mentioned - variable transmissions,
variable transponder, other spoofing gear. This gear might not be
needed by an honest merchant, but we\'ll stick with the MCr180
figure for now.

Per-trip expenses (Life Support, salaries and starport expenses as
in the assumptions above, maintenance fund) come to about KCr90.

Income from cargo (at KCr1 per ton), two High Passengers and some
Low Passengers brings in about KCr180 per trip - a profit (before
financing) of KCr90 twice a month.

Now add in the per-trip bank payment of KCr375 to the figures - this
ship, if used in a cargo-hauling role when bought new, will lose more
than half a MCr a month...that\'s a lot of speculative trading. This ship,
when new, will not be an independently-owned Free Trader ship.

However, _Citizens of the Imperium_ does mention that this ship
(due to age and pedigree), though having an original value of
MCr180, could only be sold for about one-quarter that value. If you can
sell it for that, someone could buy it for that - we\'ll keep the cost
of maintenance the same (based on the MCr180 figure), but we\'ll
cost the bank payments based on a MCr45 purchase price.

Your bank payment drops to Cr93750 a month - running other
people\'s cargo and passengers, you only lose Cr7500 a month...
a better business proposition than a Far Trader, and your ship
(though older and perhaps less reliable) is more capable than
the Far Trader in every respect except passenger capacity.
You could probably even lose some cargo space to a Pinnace
or Ship\'s Boat - if it travelled loaded, your lost cargo space
shouldn\'t hurt you that much. A little speculative trading on the
side and a ship like this could make a very tidy profit, as well
as have the legs, speed and guns to access some markets
that might otherwise be too dangerous.

Note that a megacorp or shipping company might want to snap
these babies up if a bunch of them showed up on the auction
block. Even if you only use them for freight hauling (a waste
of capability, but they might have to during slow times), standard
400tn Corsairs bought for MCr45 will give you a 10%/year return
on your investment - that\'s KCr90 profit per trip, 50 trips per year.

Questions this presents for Traveller Universe building: How common
are used starships? What kind of market pricing affects such starships?
How much is a well-maintained, 40-year old paid-off Free Trader
worth? What effects does it have on interstellar commerce, culture,
and security to have flotillas of older spacecraft inhabiting the spaceways?

Since I like the idea of old ships hanging around - especially in an
area that\'s been starfaring for over a millenia - IMTU there are bunches
of used ships. I haven\'t gotten into details yet on what differences
there are between an old, well-maintained ship and a new one,
but there must be some - otherwise people might stop taking out
loans to buy new starships.

Brilliant Lances uses a heading system. It _is_ a vector movement system,
and it\'s even fairly simple (but very poorly explained).

I think that the reason for the difference is that the Mayday system (used
by Battle Rider) ignores facing, while for Brilliant Lances facing is very
important.

After one practice game Shalom and I had no trouble with BL, provided we
played every couple of months to keep our hands in. I wouldn\'t like to
maneuver more than half a dozen ships this way, but then the game wasn\'t
really intended for larger battles (judging by the scenarios). (Note: you
can run larger battles, it will just be a bit slow.)

Actually, power plants in TNE and presumably T4 since both came from FF&S
had a duration of one year. And when calculating fuel space for ships built
with FF&S, the size of the power plant fuel was so infintessimally small as
to often dissapear in the rounding process.

Yes, it is a change..for Traveller. It is consistent with the way Fusion
power plants operate in GURPS. It may also make a lot more sense than the
way Traveller plants operate (I am not a physicist, so someone should
comment on this). Anyone who would choose to putt along in normal space for
300-400 years to get where they are going insted of using their jump drives
to get there in a week is a bit daft in my opinion :) Such power plants
also make things like sublight generation ships and such more practical.
Finally, the sidebar does note that while the FUEL doesn\'t need to be
replaced for 200 years, the plant itself is fragile and needs annual
maintainece or it may stop working..so it still hits the players in the
wallet.

Chalk it up to being in an "alternate universe" and rest assured that when
T5 comes out, power plants in Traveller will be back to their wasteful,
inefficient selves...<g>

Ah, good. Marc, I like this idea too. The "Bridge" system should be:

1) task-based
2) have decision-making roles for the entire bridge crew, not just
dice-rolling for everyone but the captain
3) give the same results as the wargame-style combat system
4) clearly state any assumptions and limitations

Yes and no as far as perspective.  as far as cryptography is concurned it\'s
a bad example of \'offence\' vs \'defence\'.  You are not trying to \'distroy\'
the message you want to read the message.  By definition decrypting take
longer than incrypting because you do not know how to do it.  So from a
porint of view of time and cost encryption is \'winning\' but the message can
still me recovered if it needs to be.  All I was ever saying was that no
system is perfect.  The discussion has wandered pretty far from that point
by now so it makes sence that it\'s gotten a little confused.

Exactly!  My original point was that nothing is perfect or unbeatable.  This
discussion has wandered far form that and gotten into examples that had
nothing to do with the original proposal the Transponders could be forged.
It was asserted the the transponders were unforagable.  I said that it might
cost many MEGS and a lot of man hours but it could be done.  The discussion
degenerated into \'examples\' that had nothing to do with the question.  I\'m
sorry if I left you hanging.  I was only really following the main point of
the discussion.

I think Mr. V. is up to version 2.4.  Don\'t know about the d/l site, but I
may a zip of 2.4 around.  I\'ll post if I do.

IMO, I would like to see a ship combat system similar to SFB for Traveller.
 Most of the necessary rules are already written, all that would be needed
would be damage charts for the Traveller weapons.  I\'d love to see how a
spinal Meson Gun off of a 500kton Battleship stacks up to a plasma-R.

Aging STYX missiles are probably the analog for the 6G AND missile.
TL13 or so HEPlaR missiles - with around 12G24 performance - are close
to SUNBURN (they could easily be 20G10, making them short ranged but
hard to shoot down, for a closer analog.) Thruster-plate missiles - 10 to 15
G forever - are something like SHIPWRECK.

As far as realism goes...the fuel consumption for GT fusion reactors is
somewhat low -- but most Traveller fusion reactors have insanely _high_ fuel
consumption.  Given that you can recycle unburned fusion fuel, and that we
assume that fusion reactors by TL 12 are fairly efficient, the fuel requirement
for a megawatt fusion reactor should be under a kilogram per year (in fact,
arguably under .1 kilograms per year).

In any case, by TNE, ships tended to have a year or more of power plant fuel.

As far as J-drive not being necessary -- they aren\'t.  This is a feature of
thruster plates, and not limited to GT.  However, they\'re dramatically superior
to STL drives.  In any case, your ship is not necessarily going to operate
properly for years at full thrust without major maintenance.

mayday didn\'t use facing but could just as well have it. BL system doesn\'t
offer anything the BR system doesn\'t have except headache. In T5 hopefully
there will be an abstract space combat system a la whatsitsname simple
roleplaying space combat or something with movement abstracted like TNE.
Large scale batlles with/without miniatures can be dealt with separately
like BR.

This is getting to be a bit technical, but CIWS uses a closed-loop
tracking system. In simple terms, it sees the missile, it sees it\'s
outgoing rounds, and it adjusts aim to make them meet. This is a viable
solution with 1980\'s missiles (which come in a about 500 knots, crossing
the distance between the radar horizon and impact in about three
minutes). With modern missiles, the time to traverse this region can be
under a minute. Add to this the problems of manoeuvring targets (modern
missiles don\'t always come in dumb), and you have a hard problem.

An unautomated system, like the 5", is only going to hit a missile by
chance - and then, only if it\'s ready and the crews are alerted.

Yep - but what would be better, IMHO, would be a hard-kill system
designed to take out missiles.

I\'ve come to find that facing is a lot less important than BL states
(IMHO, of course). I\'d actually prefer a system of facing somewhere
between "Batteries Bearing" (HG/MT) and BL. Just having front and
rear facings, and calling front the direction you\'re changing the
vector would be fine (as long as you use a majority of maneuver on
that movement).

It\'s more than possible i missed the quote below, but I think I was just
ignoring it as irrelevant.  The point i was making was for the imperials to
truthfully give them *everything* regarding the deyo transponders.  Any
paranoid mistrust would be beyond this issue.  As far as the Zhos there would
always be psi and their access to the real knowledge.  People are suckers for
the truth.  How much Zho trade is there in Imperial space?  Actually the Zhos
are besides the point, as they avoid the Collapse entirely.  The vast majority
of the alien polities (including the Solomani Confederation) could well not be
installed w/ Deyo transponders.  It doesn\'t change the story.  I don\'t care to
argue about minutia that won\'t change the net effect.

I have them, but it\'s rather tedious to go through all those old digests
looking for specifics on a rather long running thread.  Both you and Charles
came up w/ that... it must\'ve been inferred from something I said, maybe.
Chips that have previously encountered each other know that there should be a
reliable mutation that takes place from the time of creation and if that exact
change (according to the date of manufacture) isn\'t present (as would be the
case in a cloned or copied chip), return a false squawk.  Maybe that?

> Anyway, just what is the information the Deyo chips exchange and how do they
> recognize a perfectly genuine transponder that has been fed false info?

Initially, each chip was educated by a \'trainer chip\' and taught contextual
data which included the date, the world on which they were created, and
selected items of history passed on from the trainer chip\'s memory.  Once
installed they were given "detailed registry information" on the ship they
were installed in.  Any change to any of that information was reported to teh
chip and it would record the information.  Nothing was overwritten or
overlayed, but a complete running history (of the registry information only!)
was kept (and broadcast to other transponders during the authentication
process).

One of the very main goals of geneering these chips was that be able to
recognize "unaltered, untampered members of their specific strain."
Additionally, they were limited to only receiving information from other
authenticated sibling chips. Authentication was done by interactively
exchanging information (both from teh dedicated memory chip in the black box
and their ship\'s main computer and databanks).   All authentic chips slowly
mutate at the same constant rate that will show an incremental change in their
thought processes over time.  It is the recongition of that change in a
previously encountered chip that ensures it hasn\'t been merely copied and
counterfeited.  Again, feces happens, so any flaws (due to combat damage,
power surges, deliberate tampering, whatever) merely indicates further
investigation is warranged.  An authenticated squawk could well conceal an
enemy vessel, but the crew does know that the identity received is correct.  

Feeding false info to a chip (from a corrupt port official/whatever) doesn\'t
ever overwrite existing info.  The chip still knows its past.   False info fed
*first* into a ship...  As you (?) have said (and I believe) there will be
more than just the trasnponder authenticating the identity of  a ship... the
transponder is just the quick and easy "license plate."  Eventually this will
catch up and is more of an anti-corruption issue rather than fallability of
the transponder.  The point is that the info can never be changed.  The info
the corrupt port official/whatever feeds in is never forgotten nor
overwritten.

I\'ve obviously only been paraphrasing and giving smaller quotes from Survival
Margin.  I\'d advise reading the whole shabang as I doubt i\'ve done it justice.

LOL. Well you\'ve had at least one biggie (the registry info issue)...  Don\'t

It will tell the false info but that will never change.  As you yourself (I
think?) have supported,there will be more than just teh transponder.
Eventually the paper trail should catch up to that ship and its transponder
will never be able to cover up its earlier lie.

So change the date to 1100 w/ a 12 year phase in period.  My desire is to do
reconciliaton of all the data (while excising none).

An incongruity I acknowledge.

"The registration transponder *changed?*  Can that be explained as putting a

Papers. Not transponder.

The Ziru Sirkaa starts using their own system of transponder (if just as a
further show of independence).  Why not Massilia?

After the Rebellion. Vland also started their own transponder system after
their split from Lucan.  Even if just as a further symbol of independence.  I
couldn\'t live w/ myself if i disapointed you, Hans. ; )

Nope.  Not in a canon discussion.  Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s good, well written

Yup.  Do you desire a reconciliation of the information?  Or just to bash the

That\'s a ludicrous scenario.  Yes the general population could probably win

That the BB is "unbeatable" is all according to perspective.  It should be in
the realm of believability, especially considering the flattening of tech
advancement, that something could be unbeatable in a limited timeframe (1088
to whenever they would have normally lasted w/o replacement).  Grandfather or
anyone else TL25+ could obviously break them w/ teleporters or ghul-knows-what
tech exists by then.

You wanted a task difficulty... the only way IMO to effectively get a false
trasnponder is to do something like Hans has said and install one and tell it
a lie.  It only knows what its told.  Still, theres no way to make the
transponder lie itself and no way to convince a transponder of authentiticity
w/o a real transponder (even if its a misinformed one).  That\'s on a
corruption issue and not on fallability of the transponder itself.

I\'m convinced you\'re losing your mind, are hallucinating, or both.  I\'ve never

What does that have to do w/ anything?  You know how big canonical space

Fine.  How bout best of both worlds and reconcile the situation so both are
validated?
Especially as far as the consequencies to trying to keep the official timeline
valid?  Moving the date of an adventure w/ minor impact on the TU at large, or
the general imperial policy discussed in Survival Margin?  Or discarding one
or the other entirely?

You\'re right.  I\'d much rather move the date of the adventure.  (Actually I
don\'t have it, so its easier to ignore it entirely).

Nope.  I desire only to affirm the official storyline and reconcile it w/
whatever obscure trivia can be gleaned from old OOP adventures.

Hey Andy,

When you\'ve done that can you put in features to convert to Full Thrust and
2300\'s Star Cruiser, and also get rid of all the multiple sheets so I can
convert it to Clarisworks 5?

When I worked in West Cumbria (in the UK) I got used to RAF Tornados
practicing low level flying. It took a few times to get used to seeing a
strike jet below me. Somehow, I think they conveniently forget the 500 ft
limit (or even the 100 ft one ;-) ).

If you can use VISA or Mastercard contact Leisure Games (

  The suggestion has been made several times that 40-year old ships probably
aren\'t working as well as 1-year old ones. IIRC, Steve Rennell and I discussed
this and agreed that a creeping +0.1% maintenance charge (i.e., +1% of ships
original purchase price per decade) could be assessed, and that individual
components could be "reset" to new status by replacing them (per TCS); thus,
a properly maintained 40-year old merchant subjected to regular wear and tear
would be costing 4.1% of original purchase price per year in maintenance. At
this stage it would likely need to be refurbished or replaced - which could
explain why such a ship might be sold off at a _75%_ discount.

  IIRC, most vessels are assessed at 26 (OTU) or 35 (THUDDD?) trips/year.

  It would seem so, but apparently the element of tactical surprise (or
simply ripping the hell out of working parties or finished facilities)
more than made up for the risk, if the garrison was above minimal strength.
It happened occasionally, so all we can do is try to figure out how and why.

In GT, though, Active Sensors appear to have a large range advantage
over Passive Sensors. that matches up with VE2, so it\'s not an errata.

Looking at this solely from a game play point of view, how does this
strike you? Stay passive and have a smaller area of detection. Go active
and have a larger area, but also give your own position away.  I think
it makes good *game* sense, but perhaps not good *science* sense.

The two transponders are not mutually exclusive in the canon storyline.
Obviously the other transponders are pre-Deyo.

They are NOT blindly putting in the danged boxes w/o a clue what\'s in them.
Don\'t be such a tight mother, Hans.  They\'ll do whatever the imperials require
to enter the huge imperial markets.  The Hivers and K\'kree never went over to
the Deyo\'s domestically, according to Survival Margin.  The Aslan w/ the
multitude of clans and the fractured nature of the Hierate have a damned
serious need for a good transponder system.  The Zhos... in the end, it
doesn\'t matter whether they take them or not.  I say they would (w/ full specs
and info and the example of teh Solomani taking them), you say they wound\'nt.
WOULD TO! WOULD NOT!  Nanee nah nee nah nah!  The Solomani... all it would
take is one SolSec coordinator to become convinced. When he discovers (through
espionage, defection, whatever) the truth of the transponders, he\'d have no
reason to oppose them.  In fact, SolSec was well aware of the Cymbeline chips
as SM pg 72 shows.

Don\'t put words or intent on me, please.  You\'re obviously a poor judge of
such.  I absolutely accept a "configurable" transponder as the one that was
previous to the Deyo transponders.  You toss the Deyos out completely.  Just
be honest about it.

That\'s what I get for running numbers at 1am after working late. I knew
that, but my brain thunked at "52 weeks in service per year, minus
two weeks for annual maintenance". Thanks Steve.

The profit and profit-after-payment calculations were on a monthly
basis, so should be OK. The annual ROI, with Steve\'s reminder above,
would be a little over 5%. Still not bad, and if you have a trade
specialist on board with some luck at speculative trading you\'ll
do even better.

Jumping the annual maintenance from KCr180/year to MCr7.38
would keep your spaceways full of nice, new ships - since the
increased maintenance costs will be as much or more than the bank
payments on a brand-new starship. Since the most expensive
components (Drives, Computer) are what needs replacing, and
they will actually cost more than they would cost new (cost of
drive, plus cost to remove old drive, plus cost to install new
drive, plus possible costs to configure and modify new drive to
fit in your old hull), I don\'t think refurbishing a ship would be that
much less expensive than replacing it with a new one, especially
if the new ship was a standard model (with the production run
discounts).

For the reasons above, I think this is better used as an explanation

One of the reasons I love this list - the way we can figure out
how one number can suggest entire dimensions to a TU - in
this case, how the annual maintenance cost of a starship
increases with age, and how that affects what kinds of starships
you see.

Shrug.  I favored having the M-drive use fuel equivalent to a lightspeed
reaction engine (if you assume lightspeed exhaust, one ton of fuel is about 50
ton-weeks of thrust), but it didn\'t prove a popular suggestion.  In any case,
TNE/T4 starships have the same problem.

There are a number of things to complain about with sensors in VE2.  As it
happens, a GT PESA is actually an atmospheric real-time sensor with sensitivity
ranging from microwaves to UV, not a space-based telescope, and probably _is_
reasonably heavier than an active sensor, at least at short ranges.  Of course,
it\'s debatable whether it\'s a reasonable primary sensor for a ship...

My biggest objection to the sensors in G:Vehicles is that their weight/cost is
linear in range (and too heavy in the case of small sensors, too light for
large sensors).  They are also generally optimized towards ground sensors, and
somewhat underestimate the range of passive sensors in vacuum (if you don\'t
give vision the +6 bonus for a PESA in space, a magnitude-0 star is
undetectable by the naked eye; if you do it is merely difficult to detect, but
a magnitude-4 star is invisible).  I\'ve occasionally decided that I want to fix
that, but never wound up actually doing it.

Not particularly good science sense, no.  Major advantage of active sensors
over passive in space is that they can determine range and speed relatively
accurately, and, because their range is limited, present a _much_ easier
filtration task for detecting things (an active sensor picking up a starship at
a light-second can probably be interpreted with a TL 7 computer, no problem.  A
passive sensor will require significant computer power to filter that starship
out from background noise).  This generally means that an active sensor is more
reliable at short range, but a passive sensor has much longer range.

No, I did not say that.  I proposed a plausible way that the virus could
exist and propagate.  Please check the previous posts.  I stated that the
virus could not permanately effect curtain types of computers without direct
electrical conections to said computer but could effect hardware based
neural net systems and similer hardware systems that depended on self
recurcuiting tech.  The virus actually is quite plausable if you assume that
the evolution of computers leads to self recuruiting systems like hardware
basis neural nets.  

It is very dificult to change the functions of hardwired curcuits.  It\'s
easy to change the programing but not the circuits.  The programming can be
flushed and reloaded to disposed of any virus.  This type of system is
pretty much immune to the virus as it can be flushed and reload.  In a
hardware implimented neural net the virus can impress itself into the
hardware making it nearly unremovable.  You could toss the memory and
processor core out at air lock but that is pretty much replacing the computer.

I can only assume you missed the post.  Perhap you or I have missed some
posts and that may be the reason for the misunberstandings.

There have always been conspirators.  The THEY is not the one big THEY that
is so popular in paranoids\' dreams but dozens of \'they\' in small letters
trying to promote there own aganda.  Look at the MOB, the TONGS, and the
Yakuza.  There are a great many groups that want to inflict their will on
you.  Pick any political group.  They have great power and lots of money.
They have access to resources that those who are not in their group do not.
Sounds like a consperacy to me or perhaps you prefer their politically
correct name, special interest groups.  Their \'orbital mind control lasers\'
are infomercials and payed political ads.  Their agandas are not as far
reaching as the mythalogical big \'THEY\' but they can still be an
aggravation.  How many stories have you heard of little people run down be
governments, corporations, or just people that know how to manipulate the
system?

Hey, I can do that too :)

Actually, right now I am working on:

b) Adding BL/BR stats to FF&S sheet
c) Finishing GT sheet
d) Finishing Full Thrust Fleet Book sheet (has nothing to do with Traveller,
but I thought you might want to know).

If someone out there ever comes up with a FF&S -> Full Thrust conversion
system that is formulaic (is that a word)...I\'ll add it to the sheet in a
heartbeat.

Although it does not affect me (I play in a pre-Deyo milleu), I find it
difficult to believe that the Deyo chip is:

a) Unforgable.
b) All-pervasive in the Imperium, let alone the universe.

The first one is based upon the notion that given enough time and money,
anything can be forged. Sure, technology advances, making the forging harder
with old tech...but forging technology progresses as well.

I just don\'t see how the logistics of the second one works. To replace the
transponder in all the old ships...wow, that would be a mess.

And I certainly would not have other governments installing Deyo chips...you
state that they would want to, in order to trade with the Imperium. Well,
the argument goes both ways...would the Imperium require them, and risk
losing trade. Personally, I don\'t see the K\'Kree buying it...and the Hivers
are clever enough that they would figure out the hidden agenda.

I respect Gary\'s opinion...but IMHO the Deyo chip was a plot device to
justify the widespread affect of Virus...and since I (personally) hate the
TNE era and Virus, I feel that logic outweighs the plot and I don\'t treat
the Deyo\'s the same way Gary does. IMTU, of course.

For the record, though. The Powers That Know have stated on many occasion
that the DGP material IS canon...it was all GDW approved.

Not much of a change here.  If you can eliminate jump fuel in CT
you have a elimated most of the fuel (Esp. for high jump ships)
even if you having eliminated it all.  That is enough to bring
the problem on.  This is a problem more with drop tank than
anything else.

I would say that from the time that triremes and other ram equipped galleys
went out of favour until the advent of the rifled gun and high explosive
shells defence has pretty much ruled naval warfare. Similarly on land IMHO
defence has generally been superior to offence through most of history.
Even in WWII, which everybody thinks proved fixed defences to be outmoded,
defensive lines were only broken by massively superior force, unless they
could be by-passed (like the Manginot Line), let alone such strongpoints as
cities. Look at Stalingrad, for example - in both the taking and retaking
of the city the defenders made the attackers pay very, very heavily even
though they were outnumbered.

Fundamentally, it\'s harder to propagate TL changes the larger your Area
of Operations are. The Terra (pre-IW period) are able to move tech very
rapidly because they are considerably smaller. With something the size
of the 3I (or 1I or 2I) maintaining a stable technological base over the
size of the Imperium is going to slow things down considerably since the
infrastructure to support a higher TL has to propogate out from the area
of innovation. You can\'t simply invent a J4 drive then start shipping
them...you need to train techs, develop the spare parts factories, the
JDrive factories, the factories for the _parts_ for those factories,
etc, etc. The larger the area you need to operate in  the longer it will
take to get all of this in place.

This size also affects IN purchasing trends as well...The Navy has a
gigantic AO..they\'re going to be really conservative, as in the case of
a war the fleets involved are going to have to live off the local
infrastructure to a large extent. That alone will slow the advance of
technology.

Remember, for Terra, particularly in the pre-IW and IW periods, tech
advances are hugely Defense-driven (as in \'Department of\'), and with an
AO it takes nearly a year to get across, they\'re going to standardise on
fixed designs for a long, LONG time.

Finally, also pertinent, TL, in the main, refers to long-lifespan
equipment like starships. Smaller articles may be available at higher
TLs quite quickly, a TL-15 Tamagotchi probably propagates across the 3I
in a matter of a few years, disp[lacing all those now hopelessly behing
TL-14 ones, but this is _not_ going to apply to starships, vehicles or
heavy weaponry.

Next time I bring this up I will remember to add: "...and since the 3rd
Imperium nevertheless manages to stay ahead of all its neighbors and
since the Solomani Confederation has not reached TL 30 yet, it is obvious
that the cause for this slow advancement is not cultural."

I prefer to keep the lid firmly on that particular can of worms and just
say that that is the way it works. What? Can you prove how long it will
usually take to advance technology beyond TL 9? Can you even prove that
the speed with which we have advanced in the last couple of centuries is
not a freak occurrence? Nope. Let\'s leave well enough alone. JMO.

Okay, so does someone care to put some real numbers per TL per kW/h for
GURPS Vehicles-style fusion fuel consumption?

Something in me just hates to answer a player\'s question like "So how much
fuel is in our fusion plant?" with "Oh, \'bout 200 years worth."

MA Lloyd\'s Vehicles extensions (found on GURPSnet) did not do this, and the
GURPS mailing list was less than helpful when I brought it up about a year
ago. Perhaps it was lost in the melee ... in any event, maybe the TML can
help, since GURPS has been granfathered in via GT.

I think I get some idea.

It was kind of funny...I prepped this adventure to run, and wrote
"resumes" for all the pre-gen characters - UPP, age, profession,
equipment qualified on (but not skill levels). You had the Ex-Marine
with qualifications in Battle Dress and Unarmed Combat. You had the
Belter with qualifications in Starship Piloting, Vacc Suit ops and
Electronics, and so on, a regular half-dozen crack operatives.
Then you had this Reporter, with an age, a UPP, and _no_ equipment
qualifications listed (she was the one with JoT-3).

I had my player group (Twilight2000/Champions/later Shadowrun)

Actually, now that David Pulver has been spotted on the TML, maybe we can
have some meeting of the minds when it comes to things sensory. The
differences between Bruce\'s DSR and GURPS Vehicles are pretty striking (at
least to me -- but maybe I am getting confused by all the range/speed
modifiers). I have the highest respect for David\'s research abilities, but
an even higher respect for Bruce\'s professional opinion (so guess which
sensor rules I\'ve been using). Hey Bruce, any chance of a GURPS version of
the DSR? ;-)

yeah, I\'m fortunate in that the UofA has a \'site license\' with the EB to

For myself I had never known that the real name of the ship was the

Nope, contragrav degrades gradually and losses thrust at 10 diameters, 
Thrusters cut off abruptly at 1000 diameters. Its a change introduced in T4, 
presumably to avoid exactly that problem. Besides in all versions you could 
always do that anyway (its relatively easy to build a ship with years of fuel, 
jump fuel itself will do it).

Of course it does!

If you accept that the RoM was "contaminated" by the Vilani cultural ethos
against tech, then certain implications can be followed through.

1) The old 1st Empire was in turn contaminated by the Terrans (all those Naval
Officers and settlers following them) and ...

2) Who did Estigaribbia trust to rule the Solomani sphere for him? The classic
principle is *not* to use like to rule like. If you want governors who will not
hesitate to crush resistance, and troops who will not hesitate to follow orders
to do so, you ensure they are from a different ethnic and racial group than
those they are ruling.

Ergo, and following not too distorted logic ... it took 100,000 Terran Naval
Officers to rule the Vilani Imperium, people who were used to following orders
of whoever was in charge without complaint. 

How many would it have taken to rule the Solomani sphere at the time? Especially
in the face of resistance to a coup that is certainly not going to have been
universally popular? (and it is made plain that, while the colonists supported
it, not everyone else did ... and I suspect that, allowing for 3000 years of
distortions, not even all the colonists did, or could be relied on to).

So who do you use?

The Vilani, of course!

They are used to following orders.

You do a reverse swap.

The 100,000 terrans are replaced by a hell of a lot more than 100,000 Vilani and
Vilani troops to support them.

Ergo, the Solomani are still ruled by the descendants of the Vilani occupation
force ... which must have been particularly harsh to suppress all possible
opposition to the coup.

Really, nothing else explains the complete and total victory of a
militaristic/totalitatian coup against a democratic state. There must have been
resistance ... so how was it suppressed?

I really think that my solution is at least as likely as anyone else\'s.

It also explains why the Solomani remain behind ... the Solomani Party and
SolSec (really dominated by closet Vilani who hid their identities during the
Long Night, and suppress the truth) have a much tighter control over the people
of the Solomani sphere, and *continue* to effectively (if not necessarily
intentionally) and viciously suppress technological development.

The Terrans running the 2I broke down Vilani conservatism *just* enough to allow
*some* advancement ... at slightly more than the snail\'s pace the Vilani were
used to, and slightly faster than the repressive Solomani regime allows the true
Terrans.

Well, it *makes sense* ... is it true? How otherwise do you explain the lack of
Terran revolts against the RoM?

Bruce, as a "good old boy",  you could have asked me and I\'d have set
you straight. ;->  The unionists never accepted the name \'Virginia\',
preferring to continue calling the cut-down and rebuilt ship the
\'Merrimack.\'  Seeing as the Yankees won, they get to call the shots on
the names...except for Bull Run, that is, for some reason the Southern
name for the first of those battles has stuck. ;->

Besides, the battle between \'The Monitor\' and \'The Merrimack\' has more
panache, than \'Montior\' vs \'Virginia\', don\'t you think? It\'s not the
first time the name of battle has been what people decided to call it,
not where it really happened, or who was actually in it. I guess, you
knew that The Battle of Bunker Hill was fought mainly on Breed\'s Hill,
right? ;->

Much of it.  First, Pyramid is not, strictly speaking, a "house organ",
which means they publish non-GURPS material as well.  Second, given that
GURPS _is_ "Generic", a lot of the SF gaming material (G:T or other) can
be ported into your game.  Third, subscribing to Pyramid gives you
access to the play-testing material (thus a sneak peek at whatever G:T
stuff they plan to release).

Besides, they still carry "Murphy\'s Rules."  ;-)

The Imperium has noted this, and there is a *lot* of fleet near to the
Vargr Extents. I suspect that, given any sort of commitment by the IN to
suppressing Vargr, you would have enough IN ships on \'routine patrols\' to
make piracy unhealthy.

Now, if the Fleet is busy, or away, or blown up in the Civil War, it\'s a
different story.

The problem is that the insurers know this, and will probably use a heavily
armed fast trader for this job. Check out the Elisabeth class Exploratory
Trader in the THUDDD archives (it\'s on Craig Berry\'s page. Do a Lycos
search for THUDDD). It has 2.1 gigajoules of laser output (probably 3 600
megajoule lasers, and three 100 mejajoule lasres for missile defense. One
of those 600 megajoule lasers can ruin most pirates days).

The other options are to escort the ship, or to build a \'fast trader\' with
many external grapples for 20 dton launches - fighters in high risk
environments, cargo shuttles in low risk environments.

The analogy isnt muggings, and murders by and of members of the criminal
class. The analogy would be truck hijackings. If I remember correctly, one
of the law-enforcement types on the list pointed out that the 70s rash of
\'truck hijackings\' were actually inside jobs. Barratry - theft of the ship
by the crew - is easier than piracy, because you already have in effect
already boarded the ship and captured it.

Yes, but the problem is inside 100 diameters is where the interstellar
traders are. \'Chicken stealing\' in the outsystem - raiding isolated belter
colonies, stealing sublight cargo shuttles and so on - is a different
matter. Much lower risk, much lower reward ... \'There are old pirates, and
there are bold pirates, but there are very few old, bold pirates\'.

Astrological bodies tend to be small, guarded (or at least monitored by a
cheap sensor array) or both. Sensible captains also route their exit away
from these bodies.

Also, any intelligence that can by done by and for pirate rings can be done
better by professional agents of Enemy Powers. INI et al (you know there
are 7 different branches of the IISS that deal with Intel matters, and not
all of them report thru Operational Control ?) should be worried by this
sort of Intel gathering - they may not care about pirates per se, but what
if the pirate ring is in fact a front for an Enemy Power ?

Orginised crime has it\'s own disadvantages - a pirate support crew that
commits barratry can presumably expect free pardons from the Imperial
authorities, plus a substantial reward - perhaps even as much as 10% of the
value of the ship they bring back.

I dont know how the numbrs would crunch, but if you assume that skill use
on a brand-new ship is at standard, but for every 5 (Gurps, MT, T4) or 10
(CT) years of ship age, the crews appropriate skills fall by one, then old
ships become more viable, without imposing higher cash maintainence costs.

One thing I suspect is that highly skilled crew can demand *very* high
salaries, if crew skill affects ship performance (as it should). If a
captain with Pilot-4, Ship Tactics-4 in CT terms is the equivalent of a
ship 1 G more agile and 50% more heavily armed, then that individual is
going to be in an excellent position to argue for a top-of-the-line salary.

The caveat is that if you can have 40 year old Corsairs acting as traders,
then you can do the same thing with 40 year old Far Traders.

Once you crunch in currency exchange rates for ships built with \'obsolete\'
technology, then ship prices fall further. A TL12 merchant ship in a TL15
Imperium should sell for a substantial discount, but have comparable
performance to a TL15 ship of the same jump rating (probably 90% as
effective, but I havent built any TL15 merchant ships to the template of a
Recollet or similar).

Well, yes, propogation may be more difficult.

So what?

This does not in any way affect an individual world\'s ability to advance. This
is, after all, what happens in the "canon" of the 3I.

Sorry, this is handwaving. The 3I has worlds that are at TL15 and above. Most
are not. This in no way changes the fact that the 3I has TL15 worlds.

This is not what I am talking about at all.

For the sake of argument, I\'ll even accept it is true.

Still, it doesn\'t change the *fact* that it doesn\'t prevent individual worlds
from reaching TL15+.

All true, but so what? It isn\'t the argument.

Make that the *IMPERIAL* Navy and I\'ll agree, to an extent.

The Terran Navy? In the Nth Interstellar War? Nope, it didn\'t ... otherwise it
wouldn\'t have won.

Difficult is *not* the same as impossible. It is *difficult* for a Navy to do
what you say, bot impossible for it to do that.

Why? Difficult does *not* equal impossible. This is a Vilani attitude! "Don\'t

Not necessarily the case. Computers are beyond that, even now. A lot of

True, but so what? It doesn\'t change the fact that the Imperium has TL15. And,
if it had been conquered *properly* by the Terrans (if Grandfather and his
Estigaribbia robot clone hadn\'t stepped in <grin>) then it would probably be
TL20+ even allowing for the Long Night.

That\'s my opinion, FWIW.

Well, no, it isn\'t obvious ... for reasons I explained in a post that should be
in this or the next digest.

The Vilani stuffed up the Solomani while the Terrans freed up the Vilani. That\'s
the reason, basically.

No, but the speed of advance is indicative ... as are the cultural reasons for
it. There would have to be some huge disaster to change this ... like being
conquered by the Vilani (which I would say the Terrans actually were once
Estigaribbia staged his coup).

Some National Guard units that trace their ancestry to Confederate units
have the Confederate battle names on their campaign/battle streamers
(e.g., "Sharpsburg" in lieu of "Antietam").  <plug for LAARNG unit>In
fact, IIRC, 1st Battalion, 141st Field Artillery ("Washington

ObTrav:  IYTUs, how far back do your oldest military units trace
lineage?  F\'r instance, is there a jump troop unit that traces its
history back to the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of World War II? 
How \'bout the Glosters?

Utterly horrific.

Hans did the numbers a while ago. Trade becomes dominated by jump-5
completely drop-tank equipped ships, and starports become filling stations.

The feel (IMO) turns from Traveller into Bab 5.

My preferred solution is to allow drop tanks, but rule they increase the
chance of misjump to 1/36. This means that a ship using drop tanks will, on
average, be lost after about 70 jumps, or about 3 years operation. This
completely stuffs their required rate of return, but still allows use of
drop tanks on military ships, especially for deep penetration raids (2%
losses getting there will be lost in rounding error as far as  Fleet HQ is
concerned for deep penetration raids).

Also, if the AHL could be allowed some pocket meson guns/PAs like those on
the Clippers?

 The fundamental point is that the AHL is a High Guard design, and the
Aurora a FFS1 design.

I suspect that all versions of the Traveller rules for ships have allowed
later designs to out perform early design sequence ships.

If it was under High Guard Rules the battle may have been closer, but it
depends on the Clipper\'s spinal mount performance - they can make 7 shots
to one from the AHL.

I ran a FT conversion using 15kT Zho battleriders (eggshells with big
honking meson guns) and an AHL, and the Zho\'s lost two out of three but
made a mission kill. So I can believe the results.

YES!

Backfit HEPLaR if you want, and knock out the artifical acceleration
limits, but I would love to see something as simple as HG, even if it is an
abstract re-write of QSDS.

I don\'t necessarily want HG style combat (although I do want descriptive
abstract non-hex map combat as an option as hex stuff turns some of my
players off).

This was one of the few areas of T4 I (and my group) liked a lot - it is
fast, lethal and the armour rules work. Not to mention the best autofire
rules so fire (IMO). Please don\'t change it too much ;-)

Some library data would be useful *or* a general timeline for the Imperium
in about the same level of detail as the timeline in the M0 Campaign. Or
just use Clayton\'s?  "A concise history of the Imperium\' if he\'ll let you.
It is an excellent background work and was in an old Digest IIRC.

This is key. The background sells games today - pick up any of the systems
out now (Faded Suns , GT etc) and look at the background levels.

Sidebars are excellent too. Examples I would cite as good quality books
include Legend of the 5 Rings, Faded Suns, SLA Industries, Elric!, In
Nomine and MT).

Add in good art (if only line art) and typesetting and you\'ve got something
excellent.

The T5 system for tasks was well accepted at all the events I\'ve demo\'d at
for BITS, and went smoothly in the Tournaments.

My own group were sceptical for the first session then adopted the 1/2 dice

Make that three of use then.. Anyway - IMO the CT/MT background is a great
one to play in. I tend to start groups around 1115 to let them see it all
fall apart. It can be amusing when they end up running from ihatei ships
which jump in.

Hard Times is IMO the best ever Traveller supplement. I loved it. It is
what I hated about Virus. All those worlds, truggling to recover to the
heights from which they had fallen being snuffed out. And the whole thing
spreading like ripples in a pond beyond the Imperial borders. It still
sends a shiver through me.

I had no problem with them, but I hated the T-Plate being dropped. If you

;-)

I agree - I\'ve seen the draft we had at GenCon, and I\'ll be buying the
hardback, but I don\'t like GURPS much. I still like T4.1\'s basics.

While doing some studies for the last (or was it last but one?) round of
the piracy fl...debate I found that if you start and finish in a GV type
star\'s system you can actually get quite a nice velocity (as far as
non-relativistic velocities go, at any rate).

Time across Sol\'s 1000 D limit						
Gravities	1	2	3	4	5	6	
Days		6.9d	4.9d	4.0d	3.5d	3.1d	2.8d
v (m/s)	6.0E6	8.5E6	1.0E7	1.2E7	1.3E7	1.5E7
v (% of C)	1.99	2.82	3.45	3.98	4.45	4.88
Tau		1.000	1.000	1.001	1.001	1.001	1.001

		A/P Cent	Barnard\'s Star	Tau Ceti
Dist (LY)	4.3		5.9			11.7
Time (Years)
1G		216		296			587
2G		153		209			415
3G		125		171			339
4G		108		148			294
5G		97		132			263
6G		88		121			240

These velocities were gained by starting at one edge of Sol\'s 100 dia limit
and accelerating all the way to the other edge. Naturally in order to stop
you\'ll either need a star just as big at the other end, or some other way
of supplementing your deacceleration.

IMO something like if you have 50% or of your acceleration unused you can
face any diriection you like, over 50% on vector change and you face in the
direction of thrust, over 50% in evasion gives a random facing (with an
optional task to be able to choose, I suppose) would work fine.

Would a reasonable reflect of this in game terms be to give passive sensors
much longer range than active sensors, but only require one detection task
for an active sensors while requiring multiple tasks (at say, one task per
turn) to build up a targetting solution with a passive sensor?

There were many other good reasons to attack the beseiger, such as to
achieve a breakout for some of your force so that they could go for help or
attack the enemy\'s foraging parties, etc, or you might sally forth in order
to destroy the beseiger\'s seige engines, or to destroy their camp and
attempt to damage morale.

These sallys had the advantage that because of your walls the beseiger
couldn\'t see the preperations, and often wouldn\'t know exactly where all
the sally ports were.

Seventh Cavalry (Solomani Grav Infantry, "Boots & Saddles") claims to

There are Aslani ceremonial units that are older, but they don\'t really
have the continuous existance we\'re talking about here - they may
use the same flag and ceremonial weaponry, that\'s about it.
Aslan military organization IMTU does not outlive the (male) commander
in charge of the unit, at least not in a tradition sense.

Everything Vilani is older than everything Terran, so it seems. Many
units exist that trace traditions back into the mists of history, and
argue with each other and historians (or even archaeologists!) as
to which unit is older. IMTU, the Vilani have a practice of "retiring"
a military unit to a newly (or thinly) settled world, to boost colonization
and form the cadre of local security and police forces. Once the colony
has grown large enough, the retired unit may be reactivated, often
decades or centuries later, with new recruits from that planet...so the
unit disappears for long periods, though the reborn unit may claim
the heritage of the old and try and recreate it\'s traditions.

Seems to me that this is a minimalist change that enables a TU to adopt
the Deyo transponder without throwing out all the CT canon indicating
that transponders can have variable settings, etc.  (This may be
important in a generational-length Traveller campaign, in transition
from CT, through the MT Rebellion/Hard Times, and on into the Collapse
and the New Era.)

If I were implementing it, though, I\'d begin implementing the switch in
1106, with a 10-12 year grace period.  That would help in several ways:

1.  It gets you entirely through the CT setting without Deyos being
mandatory;

2.  It\'s a logical response to the beginning of the Fifth Frontier War;
and

3.  It allows you to get around such temporal anomalies such as
_Knightfall_ occurring in 1120, some 20 years after the end of the
Survival Margin grace period (if you assume that the Rebellion disrupted
enforcement of the Deyo transponder deadline).

	Furthermore, consider the average TL, especially around the
canonical setting of the Spinward Marches vs the TL available to the
Imperium to create the cryptosystem. There\'s no way the Germans in
WWI could have had a snowball\'s chance in hell of breaking a modern
cryptosystem. Likewise, TL12-14 worlds probably will be behind the
powercurve in dealing with a TL15-16 black box ...

Later field tests showed the 11" guns could safely fire at their full
alloted charge without damage. Had this happened, it is probable that
Virginia would have been heavily damaged. During the battle, Monitor
was able to pound away on one corner of Virginia\'s casemate when the
latter ship grounded on a sandbar. Even though Monitor fired for at
least half an hour, the armor wasn\'t penetrated. Hard to believe that
heavier charges wouldn\'t have penetrated the armor after a
concentrated firing like that.

Virginia\'s AP rounds for the 9" rifled guns were left on the dock in
the haste to leave. Had they been on board, it is possible that they
could have damaged Monitor. Not sure about this, though; Monitor\'s
armor was fairly thick.

However this requires the Vilani to have stuffed up the Terrans at least as
much as the Terrans freed up the Vilani. And, IMO, it still doesn\'t explain
the lack of rapid advancement in the rimward areas of what bacame the
Solomani Confederation. Remember that in many ways the Confederation had
less control over its member states than the 3I did, and IMO anyway a
goodly number of the PEs that sprung up in the rimward areas during and

therefore would\'ve had little or no contact with your contaminated Rule of
Man.

  The arachnid leg structure is not well suited to high-G, IIRC.
I also have a bias against sentient spiders in the region thanks

proportioned like your typical Tolkien Dwarf (ie. short and WIDE),
I can probably cope, but heavy gravity and bipedal forms just don\'t
mix well...



      What about something similar to David Webber\'s Tree Cats only maybe
      weasle or ferrit like instead of cat like.

Subject:  GURPS Trav power plants




  After carefully perusing the Starship design system for GT, I discovered
a
paragraph on pg 162 which states that a power plant has sufficient internal
fuel for 200 years!  Is this a typo, or just a complete abandonment of one
of
the important aspects of every prev version of Traveller?   With 200 years
to
operate the M-drive, jump drives are not necessarily needed (if your
patient,
that is).  Fuel amounts changed w/ each version, granted; but all the prev
systems had about a 4-week limit to the power fuel (give or take).

Can anyone enlighten me (or care to comment?)

I realize T5 is still a work in progress and that you have already posted a
LOT of information on it to this list, however I would like to ask a
question. Are the sensor rules that will be included (I assume ;>) in T5
changed radically from T4 ? I\'m playing with the RPG ship combat kludges I
use as house rules (which currently use T4 sensors) and I\'m curious as to
how different, if at all, T5 is likely to be.

It depends on how weapon ranges compare to sensor ranges, of course.
If weapon ranges are longer combat is sensor-dominated and these questions
are relevant; if active sensor ranges are much longer than weapon ranges
(like in TNE), there\'s no reason not to run your active sensor all the
time, especially if it gives you much longer range than passive under 
all conditions. I generally like submarine-like sensor capabilities - 
active sesnros are shorter ranged but guaranteed to detect everything within
their range, passive sensors are longer ranged but only ves "noisy" targets.

This is seriously weird; it\'s hard to imagine the justification (except for
small/short ranged sensors.)

Good to know there\'s still some things FFS2 gets better than GURPS.

Heh.  It actually isn\'t that hard.  In order to convert, you just need to know
the following things:
1)  GURPS uses range penalties of 6 * log10(distance) -- as a rule, to convert
a DSR range band to a gurps range penalty, multiply by 6 and subtract 15.
2)  GURPS \'signatures\' are normed for a human being +0.  A 100 dt ship has a
base signature of +8
3)  GURPS \'scan\' is normed so that when scan is equal to range, you will on
average detect a man-sized object (sig of about -2.5 passive/-1 active),
implying a diff of 3.5 between sensitivity and range.  Thus, to convert
sensitivity to scan, multiply by 6 and subtract 36 (passive) or 27 (active). 
Obviously, this can be reversed -- so the basic bridge PESA (scan 38 at TL 10)
would be a rating-12.3 by DSR, the command bridge would be about 12.8 (TL 10)
or 13 (TL 12).

Dave,

That\'s exactly the place I got the original idea from. I played it several
time and found some rough spots but really liked the idea. One major
addition I made was a "sensor screen" a hex map showing the location of
other ships, like a radar screen. The sensor ops. tasks are involved in
locating ships. identification and extrapolation of course and the "screen"
reflects the information. Piloting reacts to the screen. Gunners operate
from the screen . Tactics are based on the screen. Effects are based on the
outcome of task rolls by the players and work from effects tables. The sceen
gives the same visual effect as a war game map but is much more subjective,
since it "revolves" around the PC\' ship, which is always the center.

That\'s also where I came up with the "Scotty task" which is my groups name
for "doing the impossible" such as squeking a tad more than rated thrust,
"over turning" or over stressing the hull rating, or getting just a tad more
damage than usual from a weapons hit.

probably NOT a typo. In GURPS, fusion plants are sealed units with all the
fuel they will ever need for any reasonable lifespan.

In TNE, PP fuel was per year.
in CT, PP fuel was large and monthly.
In MT, PP fuel was pretty close but slightly less than in CT in MOST CASES.

In Imperium and Dark Nebula, ships can free acccellerate for months to
cross one   space hex per 6 month turn. Hexes which would seem to be 1/2
parsec (1.63 LY) across... but they don\'t need fuel except to jump!

Canon is thus inconsistant.

One rule I use is that weapons fire with a passive-only detection is 2 DMs
harder, unless
(a) the ship has been firing at the target for more than one turn
(b) two ships have seperate passive detections of the target
(c) the sesnror operator makes a Difficult sensor role

to represent the problem with getting good range info.

Also, in the DSR, active sensors go from "no detection" to "automatic
detection" very quickly as range decreases, while passive sensors have a
shallow curve.

Are you sure of this?  I can\'t seem to either find or recall any info on this
in T4.  I am going by the last edition I know of that mentioned it
specifically, which was MT.

In MT, anti-grav was avail at TL9, along w/ Fusion Rockets.  At TL 11 came
Newton\'s Nightmare.  Hard Times mentions that Fusion rockets remain viable
till the reactionless thrusters came along, since they had no range limit
except the power plant duration.  

On a similar note...do anti-grav thrusters mangle physics as we know it (other
than not being possible w/ our current tech?)  I would be much more comfy
using something that is at least possible, as opposed to reactionless drives
(which always cause my players to snicker).

  Besides the Traveller adventures and source material posted there, many

While not as focussed as Challenge was (and you don\'t get a hardcopy w/o

sledgehammer builds character, or so I\'m told.

  Even under those circumstances there should still be a great deal of
mischief that the players could get up to, although it might stretch
them a bit; OTOH, if the players don\'t want to make the effort then
maybe A:8 could inspire them a bit :)

  The only qualification I would suggest to the above is that on land there
was a switch of an advantage from the _strategic_ defensive (the glacis of
star fortresses covering NE France) to the _tactical_ (breach-loading rifles,
machine-guns) defensive. Conversely, while the horse & musket era battlefield
was probably offense/defense neutral, more modern warfare became advantageous
to the strategic offensive with improved infrastructure and organizational
support.

  Mind you, both the extension of "battlefield" ranges in this century and
the mechanization of combatants muddies the current state of affairs. IMHO :)

anti-grav is limited to 100dia IIRC,  thrusters ARE limited to 1000dia.

The hex scale should be 10,000 miles per hex. The 2,000 miles per hex
table is in error. Divide the numbers on it by 5 or use the numbers on p.

That\'s the kind I\'ve been contemplating running, too...  Maybe just pre
Assasination, as I was thinking I wanted the PCs in the Throne Room (getting
knighted or something maybe) for the Big Bangs. Maybe one of my poor players
will be the one who "screamed and lunged out from the crowd" as Dulinor goes
to grab Strephon\'s crown.  : )  Especially as my RC campaign is petering out
due to my players going hither and yon (permanently) : (

That\'s why they gave a 12 year grace period, to be retrofitted during annual
maintence and relicensing procedures.  All new construction was required to
have the new transponders immediately.  The Vilani adopted an entirely new
system during the Rebellion.  Yes much smaller territory but far far smaller
changeover period (not just during annual maintenence but ASAP if not
immediately).

No, they say, "If you want your ships to enter our space, you put this new
transponder system."  No doubt, specs are provided, etc etc.

The Imperial markets are *huge* and remember the Imperium mostly exists to
foster *internal* trade.  The same may or may not hold true for the other
polities, but my bet is that the others lose more than the Imperials do to
losing the trade.  In any case, it\'s more than reasonable (to me anyways) to
adopt the IFF system of of a foreign govt if you wish do business in their
territory.

Partially...  but it\'s explicitly mentioned that that was just the easiest
vector of infection.  Even if we limit the foreign govts\' putting them only on
ships trading in the Imperium (which is reasonable, if uncanonical), Virus
still learns how the other races computers operate and adapts.  Infection was
also made easy by computer control of tight-beam commo.  "Encoding and
decoding, correcting for the doppler shifting in messages sent between ships
with tremendous crossing vectors, keeping tight-beam antennae on targets with
accuracies measured in attoradians, all of these tasks were taken by the
computer to simplify the task of small multi-tasked crews.  Incoming and
outgoing messages were not sent or received by human hands, they were mediated
by the ship\'s computer- its central nervous system.  By tacking its invasive
code onto these messages, a virus could ensure that its infection would pass
directly through the target\'s central computer system."  SM pg 77.

There were also "the human vector" (threatening or deceiving crews, etc etc),
small craft (computer connections and diagnostics), and creation of "commando
chips" (like their original Cymbeline forebears).

I respect your right to do whatever you want IYTU (as if i can do anything

I just don\'t think the OTU should pretend TNE never happened.  I love the

It\'s also been stated that DGP went beyond what was intended.  How do you
interpret G:T Aliens I being explicity instructed by "Miller and Wiseman" not
to use anything DGP?

I like the DPG stuff, for the most part.  It\'s only the bits like lathanum
hull grids and the half-Vilani Cleon that are an itch that can\'t be scratched.
The Vilani, Vargr subraces, Solomani Gene War and Confederation, etc etc are
all quite good, as is the World Builders Handbook (my latest acquisition<g>).

Megacorps have salaried brokers at every port that they visit and buy
products (as far in advance as economically feasable) for shipment to
the next system.  Therefore the Megacorps take maximum advantage of the
speculative trade, leaving the poor speculative trade for the free
traders (tramp traders).  the rules in the books are what is left after
the megacorps are finished with the market.

It seems like a good approach. Vehicles sensor rules are considerably
simpler, in that they equate range and detection chance as a single value.
Obviously, this is a considerable over-simplification. Were I redoing the
rules from scratch, I would adopt a different system, but then I am never
satisfied. VE2 represents various compromises and systems as of my
thinking circa 1994-5, when it was mostly written. My views on many
aspects of the design system have changed considerably since then.

GT\'s systems are simply intended to model a synthesis of Classic Traveller
as much as possible without extensive changes to the Vehicles system,
while presenting rules that permit playable space combat with a reasonably
realistic feel, and to design everything from 10 ton fighters to 100,000
ton heavy cruisers, and to fit the entire thing into 20 pages, and to
produce ship designs that were fully realized but could fit on a 3"x5"
card like those of Classic Traveller (not quite as tiny as HG, but...).

Yes, it is possible to "break" the system on various grounds, and there
are realism issues. But such has also been the case with Traveller. I
doubt x-ray lasers would function as traditionally described in CT/MT,
but they are there anyway because that is the background being simulated.

It depends on what you mean by "two heavy." The numbers tend to scale

Since FFS2 is quite a mature design, I\'m sure it would. These things tend
to improve over generations: Book 2 -> High Guard -> Striker -> MegaTrav
- -> FFS1 -> FFS2, making FFS2 the sixth generation.

So far, SJG\'s pedigree looks something like:

Space  -> Vehicles 1 - > Vehicles 2

Note that Vehicles 1 did not cover starship designs, just as Striker did
not; Robots and Mecha are basically "modular design" books for VE2; GT is 
the equivelent of the Quick Starship Design System for GURPS. THus, VE2 is
really only the second attempt at a space design system... I\'m sure we\'ll
get things right eventually!
 
Anyway, if Vehicles ever makes it into its fourth generation (VE3) then it
will be able to benefit from all the excellent criticism of Anthony, MA
Loyd, and the other GURPS commentators, and I am sure, will probably
recieve some cross polination from Traveller (VE1\'s major
influence was Striker) and quite possible from the interesting BTRC\'s VDS.

	Actually, they were SUPPOSED to cut off at 1000 (or 2000?) AU, not
diameters. It was a rushed attempt in SSDS to justify why invading
fleets go for the gas giant to refuel (which is canonical), rather
than jumping into the Kuiper belt.

>(which always cause my players to snicker).

	Sure enough, they do ... constant power input for constant thrust
(i.e. constant acceleration), therefore the total energy input is
proportional to time. 
	Thrust leads to a change in velocity, therefore a change in kinetic
energy. Change in velocity is proportional to the time you thrust ...
but the change in KE is proportional to the change in velocity
squared so the input energy is proportional to time, but the
resulting change in KE is proportional to time squared--so energy is
being created out of nothing.

Perhaps, (and I\'m just WAG\'ing here) G:T PEMS range is based on \'instant-look\'
usage, rather than integrating the observations over a long time period. I\'ve
always sort of pictures PEMS as seeing farther and better the longer you spend
on it, and the stuff in G:T is for combat time frames.

Weak, I know...

Maybe SJG needs some sensors gurus...;-)

my house rules modifying the basic T4 task system.

A)  Skill prerequisites: To avoid the problem of the high characteristic low skill
    character dominating play I introduced the concepts of skill prerequisites to
    tasks. Every task requires a certain level of skill. This represents that
    some skills require greater knowlede of a task than others. Some tasks may
    have prerequisites in more than one skill, some may have characteristic
    prerequisites (eg altering a pre-deyo transponder has prerequisites of:
    elect-3, comp-4, Naval Architect-0 and int 5)

B)  Jack of All Trades 1: Jack of All Trades skill allows these prerequisites to
    be bypassed. If the sum of JoT and skill is equal to or greater than the
    required then the task may be attempted. However the JoT skill does not
    contribute towards the success of the attempt.

C)  Jack of All Trades 2: Jack of All Trades skill also allows unfavourable task
    modifiers due to environmental factors (lack of required tools) to be negated
    However the JoT skill can only negate unfavourable modifiers, it never acts
    as a favourable modifier.

D)  Task attempts without the required prerequistes: It is possible to attempt
    a task with insufficent skill (though a minimum of skill-0 is always required)
    but for every skill level below the prerequisite the task difficulty is increased
    by one level.

I would be very interested in peoples comments on my house rules.

  Wait a month until all of the paperwork arrives - it\'s the most cost-
efficient way and still effective for most purposes. With a constant
flow of info any merchant ship that outruns its\' reports is suspicious

  Are you sure that universal adoption by bordering foreign states was

  A accountant should be able to name the year when the age of the ship
will become a fiscal liability outweighing the opportunity costs of
re-capitalizing the asset. As TCS allows _replacement_ (not upgrading)
of drives at cost (possibly with the scrap value of the removed slag
covering installation) for destroyed systems, then selling the old
unit and replacing (or refurbishing - something not covered in CT,
AFAIK) that drive.

  Also, while the major cost elements are the drives and comp, the crew
(i.e., the PC\'s) live in the hull/quarters, which although subject to
annual maintenance may not be seen as a component to refit in the view
of the company business office ("You say there\'s blue fuzz growing in the
air ducts and the plumbing broke down again? - sorry, we haven\'t heard/
listened to any customer complaints; try your ships discretionary funds").

  Push: players replace their Far Traders run-down 1000 MW TL 13 fusion
plant with a couple of newer, refurbished 500 MW TL 15 units (and adding
several tons of shop/locker space in engineering). They expect to deal
with 5 years of wear (0.6% on MCr 12 = KCr 72 p.a.), and soon discover
to their horror that the real wear value is a good deal greater...

  In any event, as you mention the rules adopted on ship age and negative
impacts in a given campaign will determine the composition of traffic.

If (as others have mentioned) range is linear with size, the scaling 
will break down as you extrapolate to the sorts
of big telescope-like sensors that a starship would use. To first order the
size of the aperture/mirror/antenna/whatever of a sensor will scale as the
square of the range for the background-limited case, and the a/m/a/w will
tend to be the biggest component. 

>Since FFS2 is quite a mature design, I\'m sure it would.
Actually, the FFS2 sensors don\'t owe a lot to previous generations - they
kind of sprung fully formed based on some modelling and ideas from various
people (Anders, for example.) 

(Of course, like everything in FFS2, it suffered from inadequate
playtesting and terrible proofreading.)

No, it doesn\'t.

The Vilani were rigid, authoritarian, and lacked innovativeness to begin with.
The new Terran rulers broke this down somewhat over the several hundred years of
the RoM.

The Terrans were *not* rigid, *were* innovative, and were anti-authoritarian. So
the Vilani occupying forces that Estigaribbia must have used to keep them in
line worked so much harder! They were so much more successful. Probably shipping
off the ones that were too big a nuisance to the Vilani sphere where they were
submerged ... but boosted Vilani innovativeness somewhat.

So you have a double effect, Solomani society has been taken over and replaced
to a great (and unrecognised) extent by the Vilani occupation forces and their
descendants (who probably *are* SolSec and the Solomani Party!) and the society
as a whole has been stripped of its most creative and rebellious, quite
deliberately, over the several centuries of the RoM.

Simple, really.

*Except* for SolSec. Which must be following the tradition of Vilani Occupation
Security (and may well be still ethnically Vilani ... though, of course, they
are hiding by using the "big lie" mechanism ... saying that they\'re pure
Terran!).

Maybe. That\'s not the way I read the RoM. YMMV.

The major criticism I have are

(1) the existing trade rules do not encourage long distance trade (ie
across a couple of subsectors)

(2) they allow money to be made with too much certainty, as long as you
have a minimal amount of capital (say, a million in cash - not much given
that the ship is worth 20 times that. Being undercapitalised is a good way
to go broke - just ask 8 out of 10 game companies) and a profitable route

(3) prices of \'trade goods\' do not scale with the prices of actual goods in
Traveller (for example, what if a PC with a Type S wants to buy 4 10m3
Fission power plants at a TL9 IN world, to take to an asteroid belt to sell
? According to FFS2, the power plants should cost about MCr 1 each in TL9
credits)

(4) they push Travellers away from poor, underdeveloped worlds and towards
the hi-pop, hi-tech, good starport worlds, as these are the profitable
worlds to trade with - if the Free Traders are picking up the scraps from
the Megacorps, then it should be the other way around (reverse the Starport
cost effects !)

(5) the poor, lo-tech worlds have unprofitable exports, but have the hard
currency to import goods (IN pensions will provide a drip feed of hard
currency, but only a drip feed)

(6) they do not deal with financial intermediaries (\'I own 20% equity in my
ship, right ? Can I borrow three million in cash to finance this
specualtive trade route ?\')

(7) there is no framework to deal with players who set up even a
rudimentary trade infrastructure (\'I\'ve got Recruiting ... how about I hire
a couple of locals to find cargos for us, and warehouse them so we can turn
up, unload, load and go ... I\'ll budget Cr 5000 a month for the office
space, another 5K for the warehouse space and pay the locals 3K a month
each, plus five points on the profits. To be on the safe side, Jack, how
about you contact some local underworld types and spread some cash around
in case we need to be able to drop names if they think about skimming off
us ?\').

(8) the freight and passengers rates are also broken, most notably for not
costing more the further you go. Although the Cr 2000 \'life support costs\'
comes a close second, in my opinion.

(9) crew salaries for highly skilled crew are probably too low, given the
influence of elite crewmembers on combat capability and trade profitability.

(10) we dont have some definitive guidelines for aging effects and related
price depreciation in starships, which I think is important given that
starships are usually bought on 40 year mortgages

(11) we dont have guidelines for the effects of non-mainworlds on
interstellar trade. For example, if the mainworld is non-Ag but there is an
Ag world in the system, then the world will presumably demand Ag goods less
(Suggestion : TL8+ worlds with Asteroid belts count as As worlds for trade
purposes. Roll a 10+ to cancel any \'disadvantageous\' trade code except
those related to mainworld population. This represents other colonised
worlds in the system).

I can suggest some quick fixes for some of these problems, but I really
think Traveller\'s trade rules need a ground-up rebuild.

The way around this is long distance trade. Spend your week buying the
cargo of Tokaj Escienza, take it thirty-five jump-3s at a jump every 10
days, and then spend a week selling it. Leave the short-haul stuff to the
megacorps, and see the universe !

This does essesntially require adequate capital and a jump-3 ship (see the
THUDDD exploratory traders), but it does remove the advantage of the
megacorps in having the trade-support infrastructure.

Alternativly, put someone on retainer at each of your usual ports of call,
and give them access to a line of credit to buy speculative cargos, as and
when they become available.

GT power plants are fusion power plants from GURPS Vehicles (2d ed), which
have the 200-year fuel supply as part of *their* canon.  There has been
considerable debate on this list and its predecessors about just where all
that hydrogen was going (just for power plants - never mind the jump fuel
debate), and concluding that it was unrealistic but a useful game mechanic.
[YMMV.]

GURPS VE2 had a different set of experts and a different set of
conclusions, in this case that you could include enough hydrogen in a
fusion plant\'s case to run it for 200 years with no trouble:  better to
seal the thing and make it as idiot-proof as possible.

There was some debate during the GT playtest about adapting powerplants to
Traveller rules (as was done with gravitics and jump drives), but the
decision was to maintain compatibility with the rest of the GURPS line.

I should point out that:

(1) "total" life support systems in GURPS (VE2, p. 78; GT, p. 154) are
fully regenerative, and produce food as well.  Notice, there are no life
support costs on GT p. 122 or 159.  I\'m still going to strongly encourge my
players to spend Cr and time on obtaining fresh fruit and veggies for their
passengers, but it\'s not required.

(2) GURPS reactionless thrusters (VE2, p. 38; GT, p 153-154) do not in
general have the 1000 diameter limitation, although I don\'t see why you
couldn\'t impose one if you wanted to.

I think the strongest limitation on STL flight in GT is probably maintenance.

Phil\'s left out a bit. Grandfather manipulated the Ithklur into
manipulating the Hivers to take care of Estigaribbia.

Everyone blames the Hivers, but that\'s because the Ithklur are much more
subtle, behind their bluff, bloodthirsty \'good-ole-lizard\' exteriors.

This is reasonable; it is the figures I use when doing calculations for MTU
(except that I allow any regularily scheduled starship, not just those of
megacorporations, to get 25 jumps per year (not 26; they need 14 days per
year for the annual maintenance) if going from surface to surface and 40/year
if going from jump limit to jump limit); but it is not canon. The only
canonical example that I can recall of how a large company runs mentions the
same one-jump-per-14-days that the rules give. (The company is Al Morai in
_Spinward Marches Campaign_. OK, it\'s not a megacorporation, it\'s "only" a
sector-wide line  --  a very thinly spread out sector-wide line. But still...)

I think its better to have the cut off point related to diameter rather than a 
straight AU figure. It seems more "realistic" for a gravitic drive system. Also a 
1000 AU cut off point seems a tad large, IIRC Pluto is only 40 AU out (which 
sort of defeats the purpose doesn\'t it?).

This is an easy one.

In the Blue corner, a Tigress Dreadnought.
In the Red corner, a Federation Shuttle.

:-)

Firstly, the Tigress\'s meson gun is speed of light (actually slightly slower).
This equates to 1 hex per turn in SFB. The Tigress itself isn\'t going to
move 1 hex in a week\'s gaming.

The federation shuttle can travel 6x faster than this.

If the shuttle heads towards the Tigress at full speed, it arrives before
the Tigress can detect it.

The shuttle can detect (and hit 16%) objects moving at up to 32c, over
distances of at least 150,000km.

At this distance, the Tigress\'s firing solution is at least 1 second out of
date.

In 1 second, the shuttle gets 30 SFB turns and can be anywhere in a circle
1.8 million km in radius.

Finally, if you put a drone on the shuttle (a scatterpack) the drone moves
at 8c and is an unstoppable KKM allowing a remotely controlled shuttle to
destroy 6 Tigresses, leaving only 2 of your batron.

The only good news is that you can\'t use 6 type IIIMW drones because the
18 type IV submunitions are warp seekers - except that I think you can
point them at bases, so you probably can.

Your only hope is to use the rules in the Starships LBB - then your Free
Trader can move 1" in the Z direction and the shuttle, constrained to the
hex map, cannot see him. :-)

That is not a fact, it is an assumption you make, Philip. An assumption that
I for one don\'t agree with.

>There must have been resistance ... so how was it suppressed?

Take a look at how militaries in the Real World have taken over democratic
states. Take a look at several political "what if" novels about the overthrow
of the USA (though these are far more suspect, of course, often containing
their own unproven assumptions). Still, unless you have a religious belief
that "real" democracies cannot be subverted, many of these novels are at
least possible, some of them even plausible. Besides, how do you know that
the Terran Confederation of Estegariba\'s day was a "real" democracy?

And there were resistance of a kind. What were all those ethnic colonies
that were established during the Diaspora other than attempts to get out
from under a regime they didn\'t like? Perhaps you think that every single
one of them carry along their own Vilani masters?

> I really think that my solution is at least as likely as anyone else\'s.

The bottom line is that if you claim that the natural rate of tech advance
is something close to what we are experiencing today and will continue to
be at higher levels too, then you have to come up with a separate explanation
for why it didn\'t happen for every society in Charted Space except the
Darrians  --  well, the Darrians too, since they have had over two millenia
to clim up again. If you think the natural rate of advancement is a lot
slower, you only have to explain away two (or even just one) exception to
the rule. If you think that it is is at least as plausible that every
society in Charted Space except two are freak instances than that two
societies in CS are freak examples, then I can only say that you and I have
different notions about propabilities.

Now you want to introduce a three millenia old conspiracy secretly controlling
all Solomani-descended colonies both within and without the Confederation,
including, I suppose, those long-range colonies that were sent off BEFORE
Estagarriba let the Vilani take over. We certainly do have different notions
about what is plausible and what isn\'t.

And slightly faster than the Zhodani, the K\'Kree, the Hivers, the Aslans, the
Vlazdumecta, and the many other races living outside the reach of the Vilani
and the Solomani. 
 
>Well, it *makes sense* ... is it true? How otherwise do you explain the lack

Off the top of my head:

1) There were some but they were suppressed. That period isn\'t exactly well
   documented yet.

2) Things weren\'t bad enough under the RoM to spark revolts.

3) The RoM allowed malcontents to pack up and move elsewhere, thereby
   relieving the pressure sufficiently to keep the lid on.

4) The Templars secretly controlling the Terrans kept them under control.

5) The RoM put something in the water.

6) A resurgence of the roleplaying fad allowed the downtrodden Terrans to
   escape into their own fantasy worlds. And with all their scientists
   trying to get their MUs to 30th level, they didn\'t have time to invent
   anything.

One example merely proves that it is possible. It says absolutely nothing
about how likely it is.

A huge disaster is one possible reason. Another possible reason is that in
the nature of things advancement is very difficult and rapid advancement
depends on rare circumstances. And since almost every society in the
Traveller universe display slow advancement, regardless of whether they
have catastrophes or not, I think it is far more likely.

An aside about Vilani conservatism. Even if the TL advancement of the 3rd
Imperium is typically, the Vilani were slowpokes. Under this theory it
should typically take a couple of millenia to get from TL 9-10 to TL 15.
The Vilani stayed at TL 11 for longer than that.

Maybe because Knightfall was written by the folks of DGP? (Personally I
regard both GDW and DGP as canon, and strive to remain consistant with
everything they\'ve published.)

IMTU, I have an alternate explanation for Virus, which has never \'leaked\'

I don\'t see how the spec could be provided in order to do what the Imperium
ultimately wanted to do, at least considering Research Station Omnicrom. Why
use the Deyo over the older, established transponder? Why justify the cost?
As far as pure transponder functions are concerned, the old system worked
peachy-keen. Plus, its established and stable. The cost of upgrading the
Imperium to a new system would be rather staggering (remember, you not only
have to upgrade the ships, but the systems used by Space Traffic Controllers
and Starports). Economics would force a "it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it"
mentality - UNLESS there was a tangible benefit to the Deyo chip over the
exisiting system. In my mind (and I could be wrong, of course), that
advantage ultimately is the back door that the Deyo chip allows into a
ship\'s system to shut it down, thus allowing for "soft kills" without a
shot. Plus, with its limited sentience, the Deyo would be able to perform
intellegence operations as well. I don\'t think the Imperium would advertise
either of these abilities, and certainly wouldn\'t give the specs to a
foreign government.

Plus, giving the full specs of the Deyo system to another government is to
admit the existance of the Cymbelline (sp?) chips...this is bad for two
reasons:
	a) The applications of the chips have incredible military potential - truly
intelligent weapon systems, robots, etc...thus, it should be treated as
controlled technology.
	b) There could be some (not huge, mind you, but some) public outrage at
using a sentient species as, essentially, a slave. Even though the Deyo
chips are mutations and are essentially lobotomized, I\'m sure sophont rights
groups would scream bloody murder. While he\'s no saint, if Strephon holds
true to his publicly stated feelings about sentience, he would not approve
the Deyo experiment UNLESS the chips themselves volunteered. In my mind, the
Deyo chips were created at the whim of Lucan, not Strephon (this may not be
canon...I don\'t know the actual date of Deyo creation, since my copy of SM
is at home). And why would Lucan do it? Power. Simple and pure power. And
there would be no way he would make the true purpose behind Deyo public.

Within reason. Blindly accepting another government\'s IFF system isn\'t
likely to happen, and as I said I can\'t see the Imperium giving out the
complete Deyo specs.

I won\'t beat a dead horse, but this is what bugged me the most about Virus.
I have no problem with  Deyo equipped ships infecting other Deyo equipped
ships and equipment...I can handwave that away. But I can\'t rationalize Deyo
being able to attack and usurp any computer system, Deyo or no. Just doesn\'t
work for me. YYMV.

For the background material IMTU, Hard Times and Virus do occur...it\'s just
slightly different than canon. Virus is nearly widespread in the Imperium
becuase so many Military ships have Deyo...and most new ships do as well.
These ships become vampires and destroy planets/other ships. Big mess. Some
infections occur outside the Imperium, but not as bad as canon describes it,
and some governments/technological bases survive mostly intact.

What about subsidised pirates?  One with unofficial \'letters of mark\'?  Back
at the Varga example.  What if the \'Varga pirates\' were Zoodanni or
Solomanni backed?  Any booty they get is fee and clear.  Their saleries are
payed and repair bases are available in the Extents.  Their primary job is
to raise a little heck for a few years before an attack on the other border.
When the real attack comes they keep up the pressure or press even harder
but only in \'pirate\' mode to avoid tipping their hard.  This would pull
ships off the line to deal with the pirate patrols.  A cheap way to gaina an
advantage.  Add in so Zoodoni spys to provide intel on target and you got a
great place to put the characters.  Maybe start the the Traveller Adventure
to throw them off.  The meson guns are for the privateers big ships.  Add in
a Zoo or Sol heavy cruiser or strike carrier group in the Extents to deal
with any large patrol group and stir for fun.

Things start to get interesting when the fronteir regions are getting cutt
off because of the pirates and the war.  The PC and their ship are hired and
armed for local defence.  Perhaps an emergence refit of their far trader to
give them two more turrets?  Let them work this job a while before they have
to face a flight of raiding scout ships with a Varga raider cruiser on a
smash and grab.  The scouts hit the planets\' supply points with marrines and
grab the goodies while the cruiser and its\' escorts hold the high gaurd.  Of
course the defences have been weeken by previous raids that the PCs helped
fight off and sabatage.  The PCs ship should get chewed beyond repair.  Some
good roleplaying and enmergency repairs to let it survive reentry but to
badly burned to be repaired but as the planet scrambs to find defensive
units a rumer of an old cruiser hull in an abandoned scrap metal yard
surfaces...can the PC claim this hull before others find out about it?  Can
they get it space worthy before the next raid?  SHould they run or fight on?
Can they salvage enough parts from their damaged ship?  Where can they find
the military grade NPAWs for their Kinyener class battle cruiser hull?

Any comments/suggestions?  I have a group that may be ready to start up next
weekend and I\'d like to use this as a frame work for a campain.

Simple: Real-world legal concerns. Neither Marc or SJG are licensed to use the
DGP material. (DGP was licenced to create it, but the final product is theirs,
not MM\'s, and for SJG to use material from, for instance V&V in G:T A1 they
would need permission.) Note: It is unlikely that the issue is this
simple...licencing of licenced derivative works is a legal can o\' wyrms, that
cause people like Bloo to get paid exhorbitant amounts of money to straighten
out. 

Unlike us GM\'s who gleefully steal from anywhere and everywhere for our TU\'s,
the _publishers_ of material can\'t.

Neither am I.  The only consipiracies I worry about are the terrorists (both
foriegn and domestic) that like taking pot shots at the USA.  They just
found two bombs in family planing clinics in our area!  That worries me.  I
just hope that these people do not learn to much from their mistakes.  Most
of them are far from briliant in their actions and I very much hope that
they stay that way.  I would not like to think about what a trained military
man could do if he were in one of these group to train and advise them.
That is scarry.

That may be a matter of intellectual property - whomever owns the
copyright on DGP materials may not be willing to give it for free
to SJG, and SJG may have wanted a product that
consisted of property they can be sure to own (at least as far as
their contract with Far Future Enterprises).

I do have some concerns about whether Canon (or canon) produced
by SJG for G:T will be available as source material for Traveller
authors. Loren, does SJG have a policy on this you could direct
us to?

I tend to look at space combat in the same manner. Lots of sneaking around using
passive sensors followed (if needed) but short bursts of active activity.
You could always say that beam weapons require an active targetting solution,
whereas missiles can get away with a passive one. The missile gets launched
based on a passive solution and gets course corrections to place it in the same
hex as the target. It then goes active to aquire a hard targetting solution.

Not really, but we don\'t have the money for it. I have the largest
collection, being (a) the oldest, (b) the one with the largest disposable
income (no kids yet), and (c) something of a completist once I start a
system. Even I can\'t afford to try everything, and as we try to swap
refereeing around to change to a different system would mean almost
everyone would have to buy the books.

We run Traveller (a combo of MT/TNE/homebrew), Star Wars, Babylon 5 RPG,
and Space 1889. (My Ottawa friends run Runequest and Cthuhlu, but I don\'t
routinely play with them, because a 10 hour round trip on a weekday night
is ridiculous!)

In one sense GURPS might be ideal, and we have been thinking about it.
OTOH, we also have Dream Park, which is a lot simpler, cheaper, and fits
our non-SF "melodramatic action comedy" style better.

Yup.



I\'ll play ANYTHING, even D&D, with my friends. I\'ll play a REALLY good
game with jerks on an infrequent basis, but the game has to make up for
the jerks, which is hard for an RPG. (Can do it with a wargame.)

Or Canada and Newfoundland during WWI and WWII. Both had more men under

Nope, it includes original research.  I can\'t find the book at the moment
(have had the flu all week.. the place is a diaster), but I seem to recall
that going from TL13 to 14 took about 400 years, barring any miraculous

The distances at which they can handle the lag are proportional to the
velocity difference between sound and light. I make that ratio to by
roughly 9e5:1. So since we *know* they can handle 10 meters using
sound, then using radio they can handle 9000 km. If they can handle 100
meters, then they can handle 900,000 km using radio.

Using standard power requirements, yes -- they violate conservation of energy. 
They\'d avoid mangling thermodynamics if you give them a power requirement of
over 1 watt * (thrust, newtons) * (velocity, meters per second, relative to
controlling mass), where both thrust and velocity are vectors (i.e.
acceleration takes power, deceleration takes _negative_ power, turning takes
zero power).  Exactly 1 watt * the product doesn\'t violate conservation of
energy, but is entropically dubious.

Implant allows brain to activate computer

The Seattle Times 

SEATTLE - Scientists have developed an electronic device that when
implanted in the brain allows severely impaired patients to ``will\'\' a
computer to speak for them. It may someday help them move limbs and
other body parts. 

Called a neurotrophic electrode, the device harnesses brain cells\'
electric impulses to move a computer cursor, which in turn activates
spoken words or phrases. 

``This is right on the cutting edge. It\'s `Star Wars\' stuff. . . . We
see it as replacement therapy for whatever has caused a (physical)
loss,\'\' said Emory University scientist Roy Bakay, who presented his
research yesterday to the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. More than
2,000 neurosurgeons are attending the meeting in Seattle this week. 

Bakay, vice chairman of the neurosurgery department at Emory University,
said the technology, called cognitive engineering, could someday be used
to help paralyzed patients move limbs or prosthetic devices. For now, it
is being tested in patients with the most severe impairments, including
the inability to speak and move their eyes. 

700,000 suffer strokes

More than 700,000 Americans a year suffer strokes and thousands more are
impaired from spinal-cord injuries and illnesses such as Lou Gehrig\'s
disease. Most can think quite clearly, but many are severely hampered by
their inability to communicate adequately. 

Bakay and his Emory colleague, Philip Kennedy, conducted extensive
research on monkeys before their first human experiments. The system
they devised uses a combination of the brain\'s most basic functions and
space-age electronics. 

Before the device is implanted, physicians first examine the brain
through magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) to learn precisely the areas
that control muscle movements. When the patient thinks about moving an
arm or hand, for example, the MRI shows the increased activity in
certain areas: blood flow increases and the brain cells ``fire,\'\' or
conduct impulses. 

The key device in the system is the neurotrophic electrode, a glass cone
about the size of a ballpoint-pen tip that is implanted through the
skull and into the cortex just above the ear. Two electrodes are
implanted to facilitate vertical and horizontal movements of the cursor. 

The cone contains a gold wire and nerve tissue from the leg. Nerve cells
inside the cone stimulate cells of the cortex to grow into the device
and form contacts. The wire records the impulses between the cells. 

``It produces a little brain inside the electrode,\'\' Bakay said. 

Once the implant is made, the skull is closed and no wires go through
it. A receiver and amplifier for each implant sit in slight indentations
in the top of the skull. 

Thoughts make cursor move

The Emory University scientists and patients have learned through trial
and error how to tailor thoughts of movement for each patient. For
example, thinking about moving the hand and foot may make the cursor
move up and down for one patient. 

``At first it was difficult to stop the cursor on the speech icon, so we
had to reprogram the system,\'\' said Bakay, who has been working on the
project for more than eight years. 

Pointing to different icons produce phrases such as ``I am thirsty\'\' and
``turn the light on\'\' and ``See you later. Nice talking to you.\'\' 

Two patients have had the implants. The first was a 52-year-old woman
who eventually died of Lou Gehrig\'s disease (amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis). ``She really wanted to do this and we learned a lot about
the basic principles of this from her,\'\' Bakay said. 

The scientists are now working with a 57-year-old man, a stroke victim
who is paralyzed from the neck down.

Depends on the sensor & situation. Typically, you are looking at two
discrete cases for passive sensors: 

1. Detecting some element of the opposition\'s signature (e.g. Neutrino
detection of power plants); 
2. Detecting the opposition\'s active sensors (Passive EMS detection of
active EMS).

A quick and dirty way to manage this would be to leave detection ranges
as they are for the first case, but to increase them to one range band
more than the active sensor transmitting for the second case.

In either case, the passive sensor tells you the vector towards the
target; but not the range.

In MT Terms:

To complete target motion analysis using passive sensors
Difficult, Sensor Ops, Ship Tactics, 20 mins, Uncertain

If the result is Some truth, an incorrect answer is given
If the result is No truth, the TMA is inconclusive
If two ships attempt this task on each other, it becomes confrontational

This task must suceed before any course can be plotted on the basis of
the other ship (closing etc).

The Imperial Marines trace their lineage to the Terran Confedartion
Marines, and back from that to several pre-space Earth military units.
Specifically, the 82nd Airborne Divison, the USMC, The Royal Marines (UK),
The Highlanders, and other small elite forces.  These units were brought
together for the First Interstellar War.

Marines in the 3I still wear maroon berets, and for some ungodly reason
love bagpipes.

The system is laid out as follows:

Star
Rockball
Mainworld
Small gas giant
asteroid belt

There is a research base on the innermost moon of the gas giant (treat as
asteriod),  and a mining colony on another (lanthium or some other rare
metal).  the mining colony is on a size 2 moon.

the players are building their fleets with this information (plus other
information that will be given to each of them.). Personell for the fleets
will Cost 0.5M$ each. The will have skill 14. TL 12 forces will cost

The play will be by email plus on IRC if it can be coordinated.

OK, that character has the dexterity of a pro athlete and is a near genius.
 He\'s already paid 90 points for stats (assuming 10 ST and HT).  56 points
in skills brings the cost to 146 points.  If you are playing a 100-point
base, that character is going to need 46 points in disads and quirks.
Also, he can\'t take Youth, since he\'s at least 23.

Sounds like a neat Jack-of-All-Trades character.

From what I\'ve seen, there is very little call for trans-subsector trade.
In my design for Lunion, the only real trade comes from the TL15 worlds in
adjacent subsectors (Glisten, Trin, Mora, Rhylanor), along with runs to the
Imperial worlds in Five Sisters.

This is why I\'m hoping to get a hold of 101 Cargos and the GURPS Traveller
Merchants book.  Being a gearhead, I would really enjoy a more detailed
trade system.

This is a game effect.. the Referee should deveolp a reason for the

squeeze out the competition?

I\'ve modified the "wear vlaues" from TNE to good effect. Each major
subsystem has a wear value that determines performance and rate of breakdowns.

As a GM you have to watch out for munchkins like that. High cost disads can
impede play. As a GM I encourage my players to take more -5 point disads
because they help to flesh out the campaign and sometimes give good story
hooks (like a 5 point enemy). I may let them have a 10 point disad, but
anything higher needs a really good story around it.

Nothing is better than the feeling you get when you know you\'re playing a
well constructed game.  When the game mechanics are good, you feel like your
money has been well spent on something the game designers put a lot of
thought into.

The revised T4/T5 system, with that one half die in there, seems haphazard
to me.  It feels like a stop-gap, something put in place because the game
designers were too lazy to come up with something better.

If the whole system used half die, I\'d feel differently, because there would
seem to be a method to their madness.  But, that one category, with that one
half die in it really seems out of place to me.

I don\'t get a good feeling about it, and I don\'t think Marc has taken enough
time to work out this bug.

This can be fixed, and it should be.

My suggestion:  use a system, like T4, where dice increase in whole dice.
This can be accomplished if the work is put into it.  Or, use a different
system, where Stat gives you points and level gives you dice to throw.

For example:  a character wants to fire his gun.  He\'s got a Dex of 7 and
Pistol-2.  I\'d have him throw 2D6 +7 to hit the target number.

Or something like that.  You get the idea.

This also make for a more logical argument for Stats ranging from 1-15
whereas skills generally range from 1-6.  With skills adding a whole die to
the throw, all of a sudden a skill becomes something that a character really
needs--vs one point that a character would like to have but could really
care less about.

Some thought needs to be put into this, but I\'m sure a great system could
evolve from this line of thinking--something that will seem intelligent to
use, not haphazard.

  I\'d have thought that the advantage (to a paranoiac) would have been the

  IIRC, their status was not public knowledge, possibly because a genuinely
informed Imperium would have debated the issue and perhaps come to a decision
contrary to what INI and the paranoiacs wanted.

  Hopefully it\'s mostly automated; given 3000 years the paperless office
may yet arrive <giggle, snort>. If it is automated then even more can be
had - particularly if someone does manage to hack INI\'s anomaly watchdog
programs (I assume that INI just ignores their own covert ops, observes
those of "friendly" <ha> agencies that they\'re aware of, and that Imperial
Lines is either known to them or filteree out by their system without
their knowledge).

  One house rule for the TML Interminable Ethically Challenged Merchant Debate
is that foreign supported (or based?) elements don\'t count, IIRC - isn\'t that
in the FAQ yet? :)

  Anyway, the most eficient anti-piracy units are the smaller ones which
have very little actual combat value in a fleet action; if normal piracy 
has a (believably, IMO) very low equilibrium level then any genuinely
threatening upsurge is going to scream "commerce raider precursors".

Doh. I did  put a few tiny fins on it, but maybe you\'re right. It\'s

minimum in order to fit it into the vehicle bay :).

Glad to hear it.

Actually, that\'s a Clotho, a fur-covered spidery-humanoid sophont that
communicates by spinning webs.

I don\'t know who did the Clotho illustration, but I must say he has far
more skill at anatomical forms than I.

Thanks for asking.  I\'m just getting started, but I have a first cut at 
simplifying the SSDs.  Following is a GIF of my simpler Fed CA SSD. The 
idea is to create a system that is simple, fast, yet retains the flavor 
of SFB.  For this SSD, I have basically folded all the systems into only 
four basic groups, Hull, Engines, Weapons, and Shields.  The labs, 
transporters, bridges, etc are all in with the Hull group, the shields 
are only 6 numbers, these are marked off with hash marks.  The weapons 
and their firing arcs are the same, something I think is essential to 
the game.  All told, this ship takes the same number of hits to kill as 
the standard SSD, just in a faster way.  The various optional systems 
might be modeled depending on the percentage of hull boxes left.  Let me 
know any ideas you have.

However, Varga corsaers are canon and a constant problem.  As for the
\'piracy debate\' house rule, I was asking for an opinion of the campain
posibilities of the discribed senerio and ideas to fleash it out.  I was not
proposing it as justification for some point in some debate.  I have not
been on this list long enough to see this debate.  My question was/is, "Do
you have any sugestions?"

Security For Your Eyes Only 
October 4, 1998

Envision if you will a keyless world in which your house gets locked, your
car secured and your bank and credit cards protected by an ironclad
identification system that can\'t be fooled. 

A new technology now being tested by two major banks - Citibank in the
United States and Nationwide Building Society of Britain - could fill the
bill,
Popular Mechanics reports in a recent issue. 

The process, called iris identification, converts the ring of color in eyes
into
a human bar code that is unique to every man, woman and child on the
planet. This is not to be confused with the much older retina identification
technology, long used to control access to nuclear weapons, which
compares the pattern of veins in the back of the eye. Unlike retina
identification, which requires the eye to be placed practically against the
camera lens, the iris method can work from up to 2 feet away. 

Exclusive worldwide patents on iris recognition are held by New
Jersey-based IriScan, a company formed by a pair of ophthalmologists. A
Cambridge University specialist developed the software that turns the flood
of patterns, shapes and colors in an iris into the bar code. 

The technology eventually could eliminate signature cards that slow teller
lines and the PINs used to access ATMs, and holds promise for Internet
applications. Telecommunications giant GTE is working with IriScan to
bring the technology to cyberspace.

We may not see the paperless office ever.

I was working with the technical service group at our university\'s
library. They have a guidelines sheet for reliability of various
storage media over time - floppy disks, magnetic tape, CD-ROM.
None of them are rated as reliable past a decade or three - noting
that their use of "reliable" (being professional archivists) may be
more stringent than ours.

The winning media for reliability over time? Treated acid-free paper.
It was rated as "reliable" for time frames extending over 2000 years.

No, itwas supposed to be ~2000 dimaters; the Kuiper belt starts

You might take a page from Starfire - ships were represented as nothing
but a list of letters. You\'d have:

SSSAALLHEEE

or something like that, representing a ship that had three shields,
two armor units, two lasers, one cargo bay and three engines. Damage
would be marked off left to right, though some special weapons
ignored shields and/or armor.

Have your generic hull boxes, and print a letter inside them. Mark them
off left to right, top row to bottom row. Treat them just as "hull",
at least in the basic game. In the advanced game, give the letters
meaning - B for Bridge, L for Lab, C for Crew, etc. A ship designed
with a well-protected bridge might have the boxes marked "B"
nearer to the bottom row, for example.

I\'d say, 25-30 meters reliably.  AIR, they tended to stay fairly bunched up.

[snippy snippy]

No, no, no. :-) 56 *half-point* skills. That\'s 56 skills for 28 points
(GURPS has the strange characteristic of allowing you to take a skill for
1/2 a character point).

So it\'s only a 118 point character, and 18 points in disadadntages and
quirks isn\'t too hard to do.

Mind you, you don\'t necessarily have to be a munchkin to like GURPS (I like
the system a lot myself -- FUDGE shares a lot in common with it), but a
munchkin sure can have fun with it.

Nope... wrong on several there. You can load a Type IIIMW with any
half-space drones... As for the Warp Seeking type VI\'s, they need a warp
signature; bases all have warp reactors, even tho they don\'t move...

No, the tigresses go to passive sensors, cut as many of the emissions as

I agree Ian\'s comments, especially this one. There have been many times in
campaigns that I have run that players knew specifically what items they
wanted to trade in and I was left with no idea how to handle it.

For example: What would the mark up be on personal pleasure items sold to
the lonely belters of Shinothy? I know the old standby, "as much as the
market will bear." But what, in a nutshell, would be the average range to
expect?

I\'m not asking for *specific* items like this, necessarily, but some
guidelines for the economically-impaired (like myself) would be helpful.

Andrew, this looks interesting. Could you give a couple of specific

Yes. This is a problem. Look at, for example, trade before the 19th
century. Goods were routinely shipped across the world.

Just as an excersise, grab a world a couple of subsectors away from Lunion
(one with some sort of trade profile), and see what happens if the Base
Value of goods is KCr 50 a dton rather than KCr 5.

Being a gearhead, you already have part of one. Bits of ships built with
FFS are *excellent* trade goods ("Yeah, Jim Boy, we\'re lugging accumulators
from Ruie to Roup ... they just decommisioned a sub-orbital PAW, and they

Of course the big boys will try and squeeze out the competition, but if
that driver is in the rules already, players will find less reason to cry
\'unfair\', and the GM will have entire new vistas of plot hooks.

Guidelines would help, just in case a GM runs into a player whose knowledge
of accounting and trade is better. Even just a \'it will cost between x and
y for a small trade station, depending on the world\'s prosperity and
starport class, and the established commercial interests will probably try
and do z about it\' would help IMO.

I can see why powers would want to \'poke\' each other occasionally, just to
see what happens, but the problem with this is is gives the other side
practice, too.

Six months chasing pirates lets you give your front line forces have some
excellent practice, gees up your second line and support crews, and
provides you with data on what your anti-commerce raiding capabilities are.

What could be more interesting is to have a high charisma Vargr some
distance from the Imperium launch a big public subscription, gets hold of a
bunch of ships and start raiding ... leading to desperate covert Zhodani
attempts to *assist* the Imperials in stopping them, because they dont want
the Imperium to in effect get ready for their already planned spoiling
attack (the 5th Frontier War).

Actually, what I was getting at when I made the initial comment was that I
would like to see some of the Traveller ships detailed in a similar manner
as the SFB ships and then use the SFB core rules to handle ship to ship
combat.  

IMO, this would then give the small, fast, nimble ships a reason for
existing in a fleet situation.

Well by most I meant just about everything pre-Napolonic (plus most of last
century and early this century). While it\'s true that on the battlefield
offense and defence were relatively balanced over a long period even in the
priod when it was accepted that any fortress could be taken you were
looking at seiges that lasted a year or more.

In medieval times holing up in a castle and forcing a seige was popular
because it gave much better chances than opting for a set piece battle in
the open, which is a pretty good indicator that defence was superior to
offence.

In Roman times things were a little more balanced, because the Romans were
the first people to develop good seige equipment and tactics, so the
offense had an advantage until fortress designers had a chance to catch up.
Even so the Romans generally had to live with long seiges unless the inital
assault was succesful, and that only worked because they were careful to
ensure that whenever possible they outnumbered their opponents.

In pre-Roman times pretty much the only way to take a fortified place was
by starvation. Alexander took a few by escalade, but by and large if the
locals got inside their walls any seige was going to be a long, drawn out
process, and often you were better off packing up and going home. An
example of this was the Peloponnesean War - every summer the Spartans would
invade Attica, but the Atheneans had invested in some walls, and while the
Spartans would rip up all the farms, etc outside the walls they couldn\'t
get in. In the end the Spartans had to become a naval power and starve
Athens in submission.

In WWII New Zealand had the most men under arms, as a percentage of
population, of any english speaking or commonwealth nation. We also had the
highest casualty rate per soldier, because of this policy. WWI wasn\'t much
better.

This is a classic example of oversimplification. The reasons that the colonial 
units suffered heavier casualties are actually quite complex, the classic reason 
that it was due to the "callous British" is mostly a political argument that 
doesn\'t hold up to close scrutiny.

The truth is that most of the British field commanders had deep respect for the 
colonial units, recognising them as excellant combat units superior to the 
average line unit. Then there was the requirement of the various colonial 
government that their divisions be grouped together, this lead to them being 
grouping into very powerful corps (in the 1st WW the Canadians had 6 or 7 
divisions in one corp, the Australians had 4; compared with 2 for the average 
British corp). Again few field commanders would fail to use these very powerful 
combat units. Then there was the units themselves, where as the British 
government held back reinforcements causing the units to drop below 
establishment, the colonial governments kept their units at full strength (the 1st 
NZ was maintained at 12 full strength bn throughout the entire 1st WW while 
British divisions dropped to 9 understrength bn). The colonial units suffered 
heavier casualties because they got used more, and the main reason they got 
used more was because they were stronger and better than the British units. 
The story is similar in the 2nd WW.

	I just had a lesson in "reliability" ... I needed to pull up my
finance records from 1995, so I tried to unzip the archive I had the
Quicken files in ... bad CRC, file unusable. Worried, I wrote a batch
file to go through and check ALL the archives on a hard drive. Eight
out of ten finance archives were corrupted, plus old website
archives.

OTOH, ships that outrun their paperwork are going to be uncommon,
but not rare, and detaining them all until you can check them will
be a significant effort.

This also get to the issue of how you see the Imperium.  If they
are keeping this kind of info, presumably they are also keeping
track of everything else of similar importance, once you think
it through, that can add up a lot of info to be trying to keep
current on a system of slow communications.

One thing we need to remember is that this isn\'t like a cop
on a us street, having access to a vehicles VIN number.  In
the imperium every place is a spot that has no communications
other than what arrived on the last truck.  Historically, it
was uncommon for such info to be tracked in such a system, esp
in a decentralized society as the Imperium supposedly has....

Now there should be routes that make money reliably.  However, they
should just be tied up by the megacorps.  The best way is to have
a model of the economics of the Imperium where all the clearly
profitable routes are identified.  When a Free Trader looks at
those routes he has a low chance of finding cargoes because
they have been taken by the big Corps.

Well, there should be fewer scraps, but they are more likely
to be tasty (there will be some low profit cargoes along the
best routes along with a few cargos that sliped through the
corporate cracks)

In my game I have ruled the such systems produce a tasteless mash
that is only just barely palatable.  In many ships, in fact,
they don\'t bother installing such system (even if the system
is otherwise a "total" life support) and just give you a bit
more space for "real" food.

New systems would come and go periodically (probably over ~100 year periods in
this case IMO), especially for something like transponders.  The designers say
this one is *really* <g> foolproof and explain its features to some high ups
(even if that\'s just the "sales pitch" by an Imperial megacorp that wants to
subcontract for the transponder system).

Even w/ the specs, there is still a mountain of difficulties a Deyo
transponder.  Even so, it would\'ve just been the foreign "high-ups" to get
specs (and maybe a visit to RS Omicron, depending on the level of their
relations w/ the 3I at the time.

You\'re right about that.  Sometime between 1097 and 1108, it was ordered to
exploit that feature of the chips. It resulted in the late 1120s AI program on
RS Omicron.  But there\'s very little success until it gets to the TL16-17
range.  I\'d actually envision a somewhat...  cliff notes... version of teh
specs.  Really minor and not so detailed.  It\'s more than reasonable for a
government to have an IFF system and to require foreigners to submit to said
system.  IMO anyways.

Yes, but the nature of the transponder is kept hidden from the general public
until 1114 and even then edited by Imperial Army Intelligence to hide certain
features.  It\'s not truly revealed until the Rebellion is well under way.

It is in the interests of the Imperium that the foreign traders be willing to
accept the transponder.  Even so, the true specs, etc (to whatever level u
think acceptable) are provided only to the higher levels of govt, who would
then give their approval towards their interface traders mounting them.

mmm... Strephon Emperor in 1071.  1086 was when they were in final testing.
1088 was when they were legislated.  12 year phase in period for retrofit.
Of course, Strephon probably only gave approval to a "new transponder system"
and I doubt he got into the particulars.

How about partial specs?  The unrestricted commo and comp access is going to
raise some questions.  If the operations are explained entirely (and backed up
w/ appropriate specs and observations), they\'ll understand it\'s only registry
info, etc.  The mute button is provided, etc.  

If there was a relative level of detente, I could see a visit to RS Omicron
and full specs being given to govt officials for a polity interested in taking
the transponder system domestically.  The Aslan, for example, have a great
need for a reliable transponder.  Any one designed by a single clan or clan
bloc would be untrustworthy to it\'s neighbors/enemies.

Sounds interesting.  Starports usually had a deyo transponder installed to (to
communicate w/ ships).  It is from here that planetary traffic nets, power
grids, etc were infected.  Note it was all gradual and Virus didn\'t reveal
itself until it was near omnipresent (or as omnipresent as it was going to get
IYTU), through whatever means.  So they didn\'t pop up periodically but most
infections revealed themselves with frightening synchronization.

As others have pointed out this is probably due more to contractual reasons

than GDW intended.

It is based on the "facts" and on historical precedents.

It doesn\'t make sense to you ... you disagree with the assumptions. Fine. Not a
problem!

Like I said, some (many?) people don\'t. 

I just do not believe *their* (not necessarily *your*) handwaving about how
atypical the pre-coup Terrans and pre-Flare Darrians (who were basically
influenced by the Terrans and uncontaminated by the Vilani) were.

YMMV

Militaries in the real world have never taken over truly democratic states. And,
no, Germany is *not* an example. The Nazis took that over, not the military.

As you say, "what if" novels have their own assumptions, most of which are, not
to put too fine a point on it, bullshit.

Did I say that real democracies cannot be taken over? Nope.

What I said was that their would *certainly* be resistance to Estigaribbia\'s
coup ... it is made plain that he was supported by the fringe worlders rather
than (by extension) the core worlders. Worlds which were probably militarised
right from the start rather than worlds with a democratic tradition.

There would be resistance. Yet we hear nothing about it.

Why?

1) Imperial Propaganda: The RoM suppressed all evidence (a la the 3I and the Ine
Givar), and the 3I has done the same, as it would undermine the legitimacy of it
as a successor state (or so the thought might run).

2) Passage of Time: Any historian knows that this is the real problem.
Especially with a 1000 year or so Dark Age plunked right down in the middle.

3) Suppression: It was ruthlessly suppressed. By whom? The colonials? Doubtful
they could be trusted *that* much. They would have, even as militarised as they
may have been, much closer to the societies of the core worlds and would, quite
quickly, have been corrupted by them. To put it bluntly, you couldn\'t trust them
to be brutal enough.

This leaves the Vilani. Which makes perfect sense. Use the Vilani, who have no
reason to love the Solomani core worlders, as the occupation governors and
garrisons. If they have an order to suppress resistance, they will ... what do
they care, after all ... these are merely foreign barbarians.

Does this have to be true?

No!

Does what the Imperial Encyclopedia says about the RoM have to be completely
true?

No!

Do you have to accept what I propose?

No!

It makes sense. More so than other explanations, IMNSHO. YMMV.

Well, the only successful one we know of is that to Darrian. Perhaps all the
high tech worlds in the Imperium are the descendants of just such attempts? And,
as I have suggested, the Vilani are still dominating (covertly) the Solomani
sphere, and have suppressed those they discovered?

There is an implication somewhere (PE?) that there is a population requirement
to achieve the higher TLs (I do not agree with this 100%, I think there probably
is, but I also think that, for whatever gameplay reason, it has been
overestimated several fold.) Perhaps the Terrans managed to boost themselves as
a group of worlds ... the Core worlds ... and the colonies, isolated or set down
amongst the Vilani, have not been able to do so. Maybe the core worlds had an
aversion (a longstanding one) against large populations? After all, all the
Hi-Tech worlds are also Hi-Pop. Terra in the 3I is what, 40 billion or so?! (or
is that the whole Sol System?).

Certainly these ideas make as much sense as anything else. YMMV of course.

Nope. I believe in these instances that the exception proves the rule.

Survival Margin makes it pretty clear, for example, that the aim of the 3I is to
*suppress* the advancement of tech.

It is implied that the reason a world cannot simply buy the tech, or even
develop it, to advance a level is because the 3I allows effectively unlimited
patent lifespan.

So World X has reasonable mechanical tech, capable of producing BA Rifles, but
wants to develop SMGs (higher tech). They cannot just buy the tools and dies,
the Megacorps want a huge premium for selling them; and it is strongly implied
that if they gain access to plans (or simply reverse engineer an import), they
are penalised by the 3I for patent infringement. In effect, they have to
reinvent the wheel in a completely new and different way.

This sort of meddling seems, so it is implied, to exist all the way from the
lowest levels of Tech to the highest.

So the 3I is *deliberately* retarding Tech advances, should we be surprised that
they are successful?

After all, consiider it from the first emperor\'s pov ... he becomes emperor
because he has exclusive access to a tech advance ... if anyone can beat him in
this race, then his very office can be called into question. He can be replaced.

It is made plain that this was the attitude of the Vilani Ziru Sirka, too.

So, to me, it makes sense that the 1I, 2I and 3I all systematically suppressed
tech advancement, as it was in their own survival interests to do so. Only the
Terrans, with their democratic traditions and untainted culture, did not have -
until the coup.

The Terrans that fled to Darrian were also untainted - but are now surrounded by
the Vilani and authoritarian tainted 3I.

Makes sense to me.

Do *you* have to believe it?

Nope.

Not necessarily. The Darrian one was sent off, IIRC, just before the collapse of
the RoM (well, maybe a century or so) ... but it is reasonably possible that one
such long range flight from the Vilani occupation forces would be successful.
There were probably shorter range ones, as well, and these were probably
successful in their own way ... but they must have been small to start off,
probably didn\'t find a suitable local population to boost their society,
couldn\'t grow to the required pop levels to achieve the Tech advances needed,
and probably regressed because they were cut off from resupply and support
(being done secretly). The ones closer in would soon have been reabsorbed by the
Vilani occupation forces.

And I\'m not saying its a conspiracy in the way you think it is. I\'m simply
saying that the bulk of the Solomani ruling classes are probably Vilani, and
hide it for their own purposes ... its unlikely they\'re pure Vilani by now
anyway (racially). The big thing is that *culturally* the Solomani have been
tainted by Vilani conservatism ... and with their ruling class wanting the same
sort of control the 3I wants, its not surprising that SolSec suppresses so much
spread of tech.

The Zhos are an authoritarian race, and with an institution like the Thought
Police, if their ruling classes want to suppress the advance of tech that might
threaten their privileged position, wouldn\'t it be *so* easy?

The K\'kree and Hivers, well, you can explain it away as their own homegrown
cultural conservatism or racial blindspots. The K\'kree are certainly *very*
conservative, and perhaps the lack of an easy written language has restricted
the advances that the Hivers have made.

As for the Aslan, well, it is well known (to us) that they are really not a
Major Race. They stole Jump Tech from a Terran Scout and concealed all evidence
of it. Maybe the pussies would never have managed to leave their homeworld by
themselves. It certainly seems likely, given the fact that, AFAIR, they were
wracked by a planetwide nuclear war at around that time. Perhaps the arrival of
Terran jumptech saved an otherwise moribund race, and they never would have
advanced far or fast technologically speaking.

Agreed. But they must have been widespread, and how did the Fringe worlders
avoid being corrupted by their culturally close cousins in the Core worlds?

>2) Things weren\'t bad enough under the RoM to spark revolts.

Your elected government is suppressed by some uniformed thugs and you don\'t
think that there are enough people out there who would want to fight back?

I prefer to differ.

The RoM (and their Vilani occupation forces) probably deported malcontents and
their entire families, root and branch. WHich explains why the 3I is more
advanced ... Vilani society was changed by these people, if only a little; and
Solomani society was changed by their absence, a lot.

>4) The Templars secretly controlling the Terrans kept them under control.

No! Like Rob said, its really Grandfather manipulating the Hivers through the
Ithlklur (he forgot the Addaxur!) ... the Templars are simply tools of the
Vilani SolSec (or so SolSec thinks ;-}

>5) The RoM put something in the water.

Yes, how did you know? Wait quietly for SolSec to arrive, you need to be
re-educated for society\'s benefit. Do not resist. Resistance is futile. The
State is more important than the individual. <grin>

And the huge catastrophe for the Solomani was having their unique culture
suppressed, contaminated, and perverted by the Vilani, all in the name of a
military thug in pursuit of unlimited personal wealth and power.

Like I said, the populace of the 3I have been slightly contaminated by the
exiled Solomani.

Ignore me, it was just an off hand comment, I guess I\'m just used to the DGP

IMTU I allow PCs to get the jumps/year benifit IF they buy a shuttle for

Hire a broker, warehouseman, shuttle crew, and a secratary. diliveries

Welcome to the TML, Stilleon.  You may be the first TMLer straight from
G:T.

One quick thing: not everyone can handle HTML in their mail reader,
so if you send as HTML only, some won\'t be able to respond to your
posts.  And it makes commenting to specific portions a real pain.

Your questions:
(1)  I can\'t believe that this slipped through.  Probably the answer is
hidden
in G:T somewhere, but if it did slip, thats really suprising.

A hex on that map is One Parsec.  Approximately 3.65 light years.
This is the maximium range of a Jump-1 drive. (G:T p.120).
So on the map on page 122, Regina is 1 parsec (or jump-1) away from
Hefre, but three parsecs (or Jump-3) from Roup.

(2)  Black globes are screens that stop energy and matter  from passing
through, in both directions.  They flicker at varying rates to allow a
ship to
drop the screen and fire through, then pop the scren back up.
Someone else can explain them much better than I.

Nuclear Dampeners stop nuclear reactions from happening, thus
stopping nuclear missiles from working.  (G:T p. 154).

As for adding Nuclear Missiles to the game, we have these real
world right now.  They\'re real nasty.  Its against Imperium Laws
of Warfare to use them. As for constructing them, I\'m no sure
where those stats would be.

<P>A hex on that map is One Parsec.&nbsp; Approximately 3.65 light years.
This is the maximium range of a Jump-1 drive. (G:T p.120).
So on the map on page 122, Regina is 1 parsec (or jump-1) away from

Welcome to the Universe as we know it ;-) The best is yet to come...

That would be a single parsec (jump 1) per hex. All Traveller star maps are
like this, so you can use non-GURPS material perfectly well.

Black Globes are very high tech, very rare devices that absorb all energy that
hits them. The energy has to go somewhere, and typically, the ship using one
uses it to power either the jump drive or weapons. However, they\'ll just keep
absorbing energy until you explosde, so you have to do _something_ with it. It
makes them less than perfect.

Also, you can\'t see or shoot out of them, either. 

Nuclear dampers prevent nukes from going off. Nuke missiles are there (there
are rules somewhere in GURPS, I\'m sure, for doing nukes.) However, the
Imperium really _REALLY_ frowns on people (other than the Imperial Navy
themseves) using them. A good way to get a sizable chunk of the nearby
universe pissed off at you...

Assuming:
- - no fire
- - no water
- - no radiation (including solar)
- - no shredder

I think I\'d encase the paper in very, very thing plastic sheets,
made from the plastic 6-pack holder stuff that I\'m told will take
10,000+ years to degrade.

How sad is that.  Monkeys scratching on trees.

Have to agree.  But have you seen the new RocketBooks?

Remember that according to TNE cannon (Aliens of the Rim)the Ithulkur

If subtlety is a function of Intelligence the Ithulkur should be

should be equal.  [A lot of people (not including me) dislike the
culture AotR gives to the Ithulkur & I\'d rather not get into that but I
think the charecter generation system is relatively value free & can be
accepted even if the rest of the book is not your favorite.]

Human and Ithulkur charecters are subject to further attribute modifiers
based on their homeworld charecteristics, Hiver charecters are not.

When converting charecters from TNE to CT, MT, or T4 add 1 point to

THis could be due to the desire to avoid possible legal questions over

First question you ask the player is where the 14 year old got such a 
rounded education?  Given that this is a munchkin, I\'d expect to see lots 
of combat skills...where did a 14 year old learn to fight so well?

Also, unless the kid brings his ST and HT up as well, you can exploit 
those.  Close combat in GURPS can be brutal if you\'re strength is 
lower....my experiences as player and GM is that people with average ST 
and HT are pretty easy to work.  (Drugs/poisons that force HT rolls are 
one option).

Anyway, from a more roleplaying attitude, the point I\'m trying to make is 
that the character needs to be justifiable not just within the "rules", 
but also within the background.  If the player can\'t give me a good 
justification, then the character is not getting into my campaign.  Even 
if he has a good justification, I might force the player to take the 
"unusual background" disadvantage.  (So your character was trained by a 
cult of shaman/mystic/warrior/engineer/doctor/scientists, huh?  (Okay, 
that\'s a 20 point Unusual Background).

If the player is unwilling to work out their background, I might use that 
as an opportunity to figure it all out for myself.   Maybe the character 
is a secret experiment in accelerated learning that got loose...and 
doesn\'t know his background.  So there are other people out there 
interested in finding him.  This is an old trick from the Amber RPG -- 
anything the player isn\'t willing to work out in their character 
background is fair game.  By some interpretations, this could be 
considered to be disads the character doesn\'t get any points for.

Essentially, you get the player to fit the characrter into the universe, 
and have pieces of background to hook some plots, NPCs, etc. onto.  If 
the player is unwilling to give you anything interesting to work stories 
around, why do you even want him in your game?

Also, Youth, for all the low disad cost, can be played up an awful lot of 
grief.  The character is going to spend a lot of time getting dumped on 
with no respect, no one taking you seriously, can\'t get into bars and 
other places...can\'t drive...can\'t sign any legal contract without a 
guardian....and as many other nightmares as you want to put him through.

If the character has other obnoxious disads, they should be played up as 
well -- otherwise, you should do as others on the list have suggested and 
eliminate getting any points for disads.  Essentially, if someone takes a 
disad, as your job as GM, you need to enforce that disad (in so much as 
it doesn\'t completely interfere with a larger storyline).  

I *am* surprised that any munchkin would take physical limitations or 
dyslexia -- those are the easiest disads to enforce!  GURPS\'s dyslexia 
represents an extremely serious case; effectively being unable to read.  
In a High Tech society, it is difficult or impossible to learn most 
technical skills without direct instruction from another person.  If I 
wanted to push the interpretation of the rules (and I\'m always happy to 
do this for munchkins), I\'d assume that the 1/4 learning rule means that 
the player needs to spend 4x as much to buy initial mental skills, unless 
he has a teacher in his background.

I kinda said it above, but for me it comes down to one of three choices: 

(1)  Player comes up with an interesting character, with cool background, 
story elements, and so on.  This is the most common for the games I\'m in 
these days, because over the years I\'ve managed to find good players, and 
find ways to help create good players. 

(2)  I can try to come up with interesting background elements for the 
character, and suck them into it.  I\'ll do this for new players or 
players who are redeemable.

(3)  I find out the player is a munchkin, and not fun to roleplay with.  
They aren\'t good players, and they don\'t get invited back.  It may sound 
harsh, but it usually keeps all the other players in the game happy, and 
fun *is* the reason why we play these things, right?

But Traveller does have Cyberpunk style brain implant computers, the

Objection ! A KKM (a drone without a warhead, built under FD12) is
specifically stated to come under FD13.0 \'Slug Drones\' and I quote from
FD13.0 \'If a slug drone reaches the hex of the target, it simly
self-destructs without causing any damage\'.

FD7.32 also states <a scatter pack> \'is controlled as a seeking weapon\', so
you need another unit (usually within 35 hexes, more if using a Special
Sensor) to control it. The submunitions will also need control channels
(see FD7.35), so clearly the Tigresses will win against a single
unaccompanied scatterpack.

FD2.56 \'Warp Seekers\' - \'Warp-seeking drones can track any type of energy;
see (FD5.11)\'.

FD5.11 \'(The drone can find any type of energy it was told to look for, so
the target need not have warp energy. They can be targeted on asteroids,
for example)\'

Actually, you should be OK, as long as the Tigress\' legal team has a copy
of \'Early Years\', which deals with sublight laser-armed ships *grin* I
think it\'s module Y ... the Y sequence of rules is reserved to deal with
it. Like all sublight ships, the Tigress will get to move a hex and turn,
or do sublight TACs.

Well taking Marc sugestion of using the number of dice as the skill prerequisite 
(why didn\'t I think of that, its just so neat).

To remove an appendix under "field" conditions
  (dex+med) -4 for lack of proper equipment < average (2d)
  15 minutes

Now this is a 2d task so the prerequisite is med-2 (any reasonably advanced
med student should be able to remove an appendix), but because its being 
done without proper facilities it has a -4 on the target.

Eneri has med 3 and dex 8 (an average surgeon) he will succead on a 7-
Sharik has med 1 and dex 10 (a talented 1st year student) normally she would
  have the same chance as Eneri, but because she has only med 1 and the
  task has a prerequisite of 2 difficulty is increased one level to difficult (2.5d);
  again she will succead on a 7- but due to the increase in difficulty her chance
  of success is less than Eneri.
Rojl has med 1, JoT 2 and dex 9 (a scout paramedic). While he only has med 1
  his JoT skill boosts it to 3 _for the purposes of prerequisites_ only so he does
  not suffer the same increase in difficulty as Sharik. Also his JoT skill reduces
  the penalty due to insufficent facilities to -2. Thus Rojl\'s target number on 2d
  will be: 1 + 9 - 2 = 8- (his JoT does not add to his med skill for the chance of
  success, but it does negate half the penalty). If Rojl had JoT 6 he would
  negate the entire penalty, but the "extra" 2 points of JoT would have no effect.

To spot a hidden vehicle at distance
  (int + recon) +1 for binoculars < difficult (2.5d)
  1 minute

The prerequisite skill here is recon 3 (the half die counts).

Eneri has recon 3 and int 8. His target is 8 + 3 + 1 = 12-
Sharik has recon 1 and int 12. Since this is a 3d task (half die counts as a die)
  and she only has recon 1 the difficulty is increased by 2 levels (to 4d). Thus
  her target is 12 + 1 + 1 = 14- (apparently better than Eneri, but since she is
  rolling 4d rather than 2.5d, her chance is considerably worse)
Rojl has recon 1, JoT 2 and int 7. His two levels of JoT skill counter his poor
  prerequisite skill level and thus her target is: 7 + 1 + 1 = 9- (not as good as
  Eneri, but better than Sharik)

To rewire a pre-Deyo Transponder
  (dex+elect) -3 for lack of tools < staggering (4d)
  1 hour, comp 3 and mech 1 also required

The prerequiste here is elect 4, but due to the extreme complexity two 
additional prerequisites are also required (tasks requiring more than one 
prerequisite should be _very_ uncommon)

Eneri has elect 4, comp 3, mech 1 and dex 10, he succeads on a 11-
Sharik has elect 2, comp 1, mech 0 and dex 15. Since the prerequisites for this
  task are elect 4, comp 3 and mech 1 and Sharik is lacking 5 skill levels the
  task is increased 5 levels (to a 9d task!). Her target roll is: 15 + 2 - 3 = 14-
  (go ahead roll)
Rojl has elect 1 comp 0, mech 1, JoT 4 and dex 12. Now Rojl normally would
  have the difficult of this task increased by 6 levels, but his JoT 4 reduces this
  to 2 levels (6d). His JoT skill also negates the -3 penalty. Thus Rojl\'s target
  is: 12 + 1 = 13-

The Late Terran Confederation was not a "true" democracy by any standard. 
Even at its formation its response to vocal critics was to quietly remove them to 
the distant colonies. From its beginning it was dealing with dissidents by 
"unpleasant" means.

The Core worlds of the TC were Terra and Prometheus. All the other worlds 
were militarised frontier worlds. Political power was always concentrated on 
Terra and all other worlds were grossly under represented (Terra got one 
representative in the assembly per nation, the colonies one per world).

There was resistance to the Coup, but it was supressed by the efficent 
Gendamarie and the fleet (largely composed of colonials)

The Vilani did eventually absorb the Terrans, but not in the Terran colonised 
worlds of the former TC.

Throughout the IW the Terrans were deliberately sending long range colonial 
missions far to rimward and then equally deliberately "lossing" them (the 
organisation responsible was the Confederation Agency for the Preservation of 
Indigenous Cultures CAPIC).

I can understand making them put a broker on retainer, hiring an office and
staff and so on, and buying fuel at starports is just more efficient
(*hint* try buying a small fuel refinery unit, and refining fuel in your
warehouse. Be prepared to apologise and sign it over if fuel refining is
some sort of Imperial-sanctioned monopoly).

Cargo contracys being orbit to orbit I can also understand, but why do you
make them buy a shuttle ? In any case, if it is orbit to orbit, you should
be able to get away with a vacuum-proofed grav truck. At the least, let
them rent one when their ship comes in.

The other thing to consider is they may want to authorise your people on
the ground to deal with other traders ... this is doing to the trade rules
what various rules and guidelines about running a mercenary company have
done to the combat rules - take them from running a small group and
ignoring the \'off screen\' stuff to running a larger one and having to

You can also use them to stop fission power plants (especially *plot hook*

from working, and to make radioactive areas non radioactive (possibly in a

pg6-7 Imperium Map

Capital/Core is located in the wrong place.  The dot immediately under
the word Capital is located at aproximately 3220 Core, right on the
border with Fornast Sector.  Capital/Core is actually located at 2118
Core about 1.5 subsectors to spinward. Reference/Core\'s location is also
several parsecs off.  Terra?Spinward Marches appears on the map at about
2321 Spinward Marches not at 1827 where it should be.
I think many of the other stars are also slightly off.  I believe that
when this map was created a dot was placed near the name on the map but
the exact location the dots should be in was not checked (each sector
map is about 15mm x 21mm & each mm of error on the map is therefore
about 2 parsecs of error).

Planets with Traveller UPP\'s - a number of planets are listed in the
library data with UPP\'s (a good thing) but these UPP\'s do not seem to be
explained anywhere. Sidebar pg 107 covers converting TL\'s & pg 123
covers converting planets other stats but nowhere is the UPP defined.  I
am glad to see the then but how will anyone without previous Traveller
experience knwo what these weird numbers following the listings for
Andory, Antiquity, Capital, Darrian, Mire, Glea, Guaran, Kirur, Kuzu,
Lair, Junidy, Regina, Terra, & maybe more _means_ ?  The Upp for Recgina
is missing the TL as well.  Suggested fix - a sidebar explaining that
UPPs are the means the Imperium uses to charecterize planets & that is
why they show up in library data, this note will tell peoplehow to
convert them to GURPS descriptions.

TAS sidebar pg 35 - Already mentioned by others Cost is Cr 1,000,000 per
year not for lifetime.  Also members get 1 passage per month not every
other month. TAS has hostels at Class V (= type A) starports, in
previous canon TAS was located at type A and type B ports. Suggested fix
- - change back to previous nambers & note that TAS is found at type V and
type IV starports.

pg 36 - "Hivers like planets of size 6 or less."  What is a size 6
planet?  Suggested fix - "Hivers like planets with diameters of 6,499
miles or less."

pg 38 sidebar - defines Holiday & says other holidays are up to the GM. 
I would like to see a mention of the Emperors Birthday as a major
Imperial holiday, as it was portrayed in past canon, but this is a minor
point.  Suggested fix - paragraph on the Emperors Brithday.

pg 44 - duration of jump - it says jump takes 168hours +/- 10% or "6
days 7 hours 12 minutes to 6 days 20 hours 48 minutes" this should read
6 days 7 hours 12 minutes to 7 days 16 hours 48 minutes.  SUggested fix
- - change it.

pg 78 sidebar - Low Lottery - the Low Lottery is describded as betting,
by crewmembers & seasoned travellers on _which_ low passengers will not
survive.  Past canon descibded the Low Lottery as betting on
_how_many_total_ low passengers would survive & allowed low passengers
themselves to bet.  Suggested fix - change it back.

pg 62 sidebar - description of Terra system - it says that Terra has a
type I (ie type E) starport.  Past canon & pg 67 of GT give Terra a type
A (or type V) starport.  Suggested fix - change to type V starport.

pg 62 sidebar - description of Terra system - the distances of the
planets from the sun are given in AU & they say that Neptune is at 38.8
AU and that Pluto is at 77.2 AU - these _distances_ are way off, it
looks as if they just used Bodes law to determine where the planets
should be & did not bother to consult an astronomy text which will tell
you that Neptune is at about 30.1 AU and Pluto is at about 39.5 AU. 
Suggested fix - kill those responsible for this table & then change the
values on the table

pg 66 Sylea - the library data entry for Sylea does not bother to tell
you that the planet is now called Capitol or to cross reference
Capitol.  Suggested fix - a sentance saying Sylea was renamed Capital in
the year ? by Cleon, see Capitol.

Seconded (or thirded - there was another response).

I must differ with my esteemed colleague - a parsec is ~3.26 ly.

Don\'t worry about parsecs - it\'s an arbitrary measure at best.  The
important fact is that every hex distance is one jump-1, and larger jumps
are multiples of this.  You can jump to an empty hex, if you carry enough
fuel to jump out again to your next destination - this is a reason for
having extra fuel capacity (over your jump number), per the Ship Patron
advantage on pp. GT84-85.

Because the map is flat, only the most important systems (in jump topology
or for interstellar trade and commerce is deliberately left unclear) are
actually depicted - the standard Traveller map of near-Earth space has 33
systems within 6 pc of Earth, when in reality there are something like 84.
Most of us ignore this and play the map as drawn.

Black/white globes, nuclear dampers, and meson screens (pp. GT108 and 154)
are the only "force fields" in the Traveller universe (and nuke dampers
aren\'t really a field effect; see below).

A white globe is theoretically a more advanced (TL16+?) version of a black
globe, that absorbs and reradiates energy from outside (except for narrowly
tuned "windows" that allow the ship to see and communicate), but freely
permits energy to leave the globe from inside.  Black globes are black
because they absorb everything - they can be used as a limited form of
"cloaking device" (although once you know something\'s out there you simply
look for the "hole" in the background radiation).  White globes glow white
with the reradiated energy.

Nuke dampers play with the strong nuclear force (that governs radioactive
decay) at a distance.  They can either suppress the force, causing the
radioactive nuclei to decay at a greater rate and leaving you with a
warhead full of slightly radioactive lead instead of plutonium, or enhance
the force, slowing down radioactive decay and allowing you to store nuclear
materials with very short half-lives.  The former is the mechanism behind
defensive nuclear dampers (although in Traveller these originally had to be
targeted on each warhead like a weapon).  The latter is what makes nuke
damper boxes (p. GT51).

VE2, pp. 108-110.  Replacing the HEAT warhead on the SIM\'s (pp. GT158-159)
with 1 Mton nuclear warheads adds Cr32,000 to the cost and does 12d x
2,000,000,000 hits at the point of impact, x 1/4 for every 1024 yards away
from ground zero.  On average, this will completely destroy a free trader
at 5.6 miles (135,000 hits) and still damage her (106 hits) at 8.6 miles.
This is probably overkill, even for naval ships.  SATNUCs might be amusing,
though.

As Bloo says, the Imperium frowns heavily on nuclear missiles in civilian
hands.  SJ Games plans to bring out an Imperial Navy supplement to cover
things like this.

My feelings exactly! I\'ve never used any of the newer systems for just that
reason. I think that having value based on the item carried encourages more
genuine speculation. Players can be in the situation of having to carefully
decide whether or not to spend almost their last credit on an especially
expensive, but potentially lucrative, cargo. I could never get my head around
the fact that X dT of Lanthanum has the same value as an equivalent amount of
rice. Get real!
What\'s to stop the players just breaking open the said Lanthanum lot and selling
it off seperately?
They must know what they\'re buying for shipping documentation reasons.

or something like that, representing a ship that had three shields,
two armor units, two lasers, one cargo bay and three engines. Damage

Have your generic hull boxes, and print a letter inside them. Mark them
off left to right, top row to bottom row. Treat them just as "hull",
at least in the basic game. In the advanced game, give the letters
meaning - B for Bridge, L for Lab, C for Crew, etc. A ship designed
with a well-protected bridge might have the boxes marked "B"
nearer to the bottom row, for example.

How many floppy disks or magnetic tapes will survive that kind of
treatment in readable form?

Then there\'s another problem. Paper records can be used as long
as people know how to read. Other media can become useless
when people stop using the right hardware or software to read them.
Right now our Viking Mars mission data tapes are useless
because no one can find a machine that can still read them.

You\'ve suggested this several times in several posts...I just don\'t buy
it. I think this is one of the fundamental differences I have with your
handling of the Deyo stuff...I don\'t see how the 3I could allow the
specs of Deyo to get in the hands of foreign govts, even allied ones.
Even partial specs would be suspect, becuase it would create some
interesting questions...

	"Hey, why does the transponder need to be connected to the main system
bus?"
	"Well, um, you see...."

Letting a emissary of another government into RS Omnicrom to see the
innards of the Deyo project is tantamount to allowing someone access to
Langley, or Fort Meade. I don\'t think (I could be wrong) that this would
happen.

Plus, espionage being what it is...the other side is GOING to eventually
know what the Deyo chip can do. Once they know, there is no way they are
going to cheerfully go along with it.

I realize I\'m not going to convince you...just as you probibly aren\'t
going to convince me. But the blind acceptance by everyone of the Deyo
system to me is a plot device - and not a well thought out one. YMMV. I
like the Collapse...I just wish that the Virus and such had been thought
out a bit more. As it is, I just don\'t care for it...

Its interesting to me that TNE tends to have rabid fans...or rabid
detractors (me). Few people feel TNE is "OK"...they either think its the
best or the worst. At least this is how it seems to me. I respect your
(and others) view that TNE is the best ruleset (I disagree) and/or the
best background (I really disagree)...but these discussions are useful
and interesting, as they get us all to consider options...

For the record - why don\'t I like TNE? Here\'s the short list:
	d20 vs d6
	Virus and Deyo \\__I really was disapointed with these
	Ithklur        /  two.
	Loss of HEW on ships
	Loss of Thrusters
	Loss of Repulsors
	
What _do_ I like about TNE?
	FF&S - excellent system
	The Collapse - while I don\'t like _how_ the collapse
		happened, I like the setting.
	RCES - Again, good setting.
	Regency - Very good setting - a return to the Marches.
	More careers

Marc

TASKS IN ACTION
	A characters six characteristics are a measure of that characters ability
in specific areas or endeavor. For example, Dexterity (Dex) is a measure of
that characters dexterity: someone with Dexterity 2 is very clumsy; someone
with Dexterity 12 is very adroit. At the same time, the characteristic is a
measure of that characters aptitude or potential to perform tasks which
require strength: someone with a high Dexterity is much more likely to succeed
when attempting a task which requires Dexterity.
	Demolitions is a skill governing the use of explosives; it is associated with
Dexterity. A character with low dexterity has a low aptitude for demolitions
work; a character with high dexterity has a high aptitude for demolitions
work. When a character contemplates career skills, a low dexterity character
would rightly decide to avoid learning that skill. 

Three Characters Learn Demolitions
	Consider three characters: Three (with Dex 3); Seven (with an average Dex 7),
and Eleven (with Dex 11). Eleven has the best aptitude for the skill, but
without training is unable to safely interact with explosives; Three has the
worst aptitude. All three are selected to attend a class on explosives; all
three successfully complete the training, and all three receive Demolitions-1.
	Now consider three tasks involving explosives and Demolitions skill. 

	To disarm a simple device.
	(Dex + Demolitions) > Easy (1D)

	The character must roll equal to or less than Dex + Demolitions on 1D.

	Easy Demolitions Tasks. When Eleven tries the Easy task, he automatically
succeeds (since Dex 11 plus Demolitions-1 = 12, and the worst roll possible on
1D is only 6). When Seven tries the Easy task, she automatically succeeds
(since Dex 7 plus Demolitions-1 = 8, and the worst roll possible on 1D is only
6). Three, however is at a disadvantage: his low Dexterity 3 plus
Demolitions-1 = 4 means that even on this Easy task, he has a 33% chance of
failure.

	To disarm a complex device.
	(Dex + Demolitions) > Average (2D)

	The character must roll equal to or less than Dex + Demolitions on 2D

	Average Demolitions Tasks. When Eleven tries the Average task, he
automatically succeeds (since Dex 11 plus Demolitions-1 = 12, and the worst
roll possible on 2D is still 12). When Seven tries the Average task, she
succeeds 72% of the time and fails 28% of the time (since Dex 7 plus
Demolitions-1 = 8, and the possible rolls extend up to 12). Three knows (or
should know) better than to try an Average task (his low Dexterity 3 plus
Demolitions-1 = 4 means that on this Average task, he has an 83% chance of
failure).

	To disarm a bobby-trapped device.
	(Dex + Demolitions) > Difficult (2.5D)

	The character must roll equal to or less than Dex + Demolitions on 2.5D.

	Difficult Demolitions Tasks. When Eleven tries the Difficult task, he
succeeds 91% of the time (since Dex 11 plus Demolitions-1 = 12 and the highest
roll possible is 15). When Seven tries the Difficult task, she succeeds 43% of
the time and fails 57% of the time (since Dex 7 plus Demolitions-1 = 8). Three
knows (or should know) better than to try an Difficult task (his low Dexterity
3 plus Demolitions-1 = 4 means that on this Difficult task, he has an 96%
chance of failure). Spectacular Failure happens if the roll is three 1s.
There is, for each of these characters, a 1% chance of Spectacular Failure;
and a 1% chance of Spectacular Success regardless of skill.
	More Demolitions Training. Three may decide that regardless of his aptitude,
he wants to be a Demolitions Expert and he pursues nine years of study and
practice and eventually reaches the same level of achievement as Eleven (since
Dex 3+ Demolitions-9 is the same as Dex 11 and Demolitions-1 when we consider
the bomb defusing aspect of Demolitions as a Dexterity based activity). If
Eleven made no improvements in his skill, and Three made these major
improvements, than Three would certainly be more of an expert, with more
knowledge, theoretical experience, and even practical experience; but when it
came to defusing bombs, the Eleven (with Demolitions-1) and Three (with
Demolitions-9) would be about equal. They might make a good team: Three giving
instructions and advice and Eleven doing the actual nimble finger work.

Three Characters Become Deep Space Fighter Pilots
	Consider the same three characters (Three (with Dex 3); Seven (with an
average Dex 7), and Eleven (with Dex 11)) after they have received training in
deep space fighter piloting (the skill is Ships Boat). Eleven has the best
aptitude; Three has the worst. All three ultimately receive Ships Boat-3.
Each character is otherwise average and has a UPP 7X7777 (X is Dexterity).
	Now consider the range of tasks for a deep space fighter: Preflight. Launch.
Transit. Maneuver. Encounter. Dogfight. Mission Profile. Return. Landing.

	To perform a preflight check on a deep space fighter.
	(Edu + Ships Boat) > Easy (1D)

	Preflight Tasks. All three individuals have Edu 7, which in conjunction with
Ships Boat-3 requires a roll of 10 or less. Using one die, success is
guaranteed. An unskilled/untrained individual would fail this task.

	To launch/take-off a deep space fighter.
	(Dex + Ships Boat) > Average (2D)

	Launch Tasks. When Eleven tries this Average task, he automatically succeeds
(since Dex 11 plus Ships Boat-3 = 14, and the worst roll possible on 2D is
still 12). When Seven tries this Average task, she succeeds 92% of the time
and fails 8% of the time (since Dex 7 plus Ships Boat-3 = 10, and the
possible rolls extend up to 12). Three knows (or should know) better than to
try this Average task (his low Dexterity 3 plus Ships Boat-3 = 6 means that
on this Average task, he has an 42% chance of failure).
	It should be apparent that only highly skilled individuals should be deep
space fighter pilots. The others are better suited to support or
administrative tasks, or to missions which have substantial additional
training or rehearsal. 

	To travel to a destination in a deep space fighter.
	(End + Ships Boat) > Easy (1D)

	Transit/Travel Tasks. All three individuals have Edu 7, which in conjunction
with Ships Boat-3 requires a roll of 10 or less. Using one die, success is
guaranteed. An unskilled/untrained individual would fail this task.

	To maneuver against an opponent  in a space fighter.
	(Dex + Ships Boat) > Average (2D)
	Opposed (2). Success provides Advantage-3 in Dogfight.

	Maneuver Tasks. Success in this task depends on the skill of the opposing
deep space fighter. Eleven is more likely to succeed than Seven, who is more
likely to succeed than Three. Success gives an advantage in the ensuing
dogfight.
	A highly skilled individual might select Hasty, increasing difficulty one
level; if successful, he has completed the task first and is automatically in
position before the other, regardless of that pilots success or failure.

	To dogfight an opposing deep space fighter
	(Dex + Ships Boat) + Advantage> Average (2D)
	Opposed (2). Success allows an attack by the fighter.

	Dogfight Tasks. Success in this task depends on the skill of the opposing
deep space fighter. Eleven is more likely to succeed than Seven, who is more
likely to succeed than Three. Success allows an attack on the opponent.

	To attack a target with a deep space fighter
	(Dex + Ships Boat) > Average (2D)

	Mission Profile/ Attack Tasks. Eleven automatically succeeds (Dex 11 plus
Ships Boat-3 = 14). Seven succeeds 92% of the time (Dex 7 plus Ships Boat-3
= 10). Three succeeds 42% of the time (Dex 3 plus Ships Boat-3 = 6).

	To return to base with a deep space fighter.
	(End + Ships Boat) > Average (2D)

	Landing Tasks. Eleven automatically succeeds (Dex 11 plus Ships Boat-3 = 14,
and the worst roll possible on 2D is still 12). Seven succeeds 92% of the time
(Dex 7 plus Ships Boat-3 = 10, and the possible rolls extend up to 12). Three
succeeds 58% of the time (Dexterity 3 plus Ships Boat-3 = 6 means succeeds
58% of the time).

Ever see the data retrieval system from the opening of

Seriously, OCR (optical character recognition) tech is workable
today, should be usable in the future. Moving things from paper
back to computer storage should be relatively easy, even without
use of "smart watermarks" (a tech being tested today, little marks
on the paper almost invisible to us that mean all kinds of page
formatting stuff to the right kind of computer OCR system).

I could imagine some very important things (like Cleon\'s articles
of Imperium, or whatever they called that document) being kept
on paper as well as in computer storage, just in case.

The computer would be down, but I\'d imagine the starship would

My military and scout ships often have a mini-microfiche reader

Since my CT computers are described as "very reliable" (work on a

IMTU, enforcement of technological compatibility (a jump-2 civilian
starship must be able to work with any Model/1bis or Model/2 computer,
for example) is one of those things that slows down tech advances 
in a multi-sector interstellar state. 

I treat all computers as compatible IMTU - they may not have identical
software or hardware, but they can all run an Imperial-standard interface
of some type and (if storage and memory requirements are met) run
most any program. A computer expert can tweak programs a bit, and
some computers have more capability than you will see if you only
know how to use the Imperial Standard interface and programs.

This of course only applies to computers created for starships, or
made by companies with interstellar interests. I apply proper
penalties for trying to use foriegn computers - a character with
computer-3 might only have effective computer-1 when sitting
at an Aslani machine, unless he had a very high education score.
Even a computer made by an Imperial planet might give the
character some penalties if it was made for local use only - and
this doesn\'t even address computers made by and for creatures
with different sensory ranges than we have.

Truly, Demolitions is a versitile skill.

  There\'s been a misunderstanding: I didn\'t suggest detaining such
vessels, merely waiting for the paperwork to show up and then decide
whether they nedd to be hunted down and seized. Of course, giving such
a ship a thorough search would be good practice, with detainment likely
following on the discovery of sufficient grounds.

Yes, and IIRC, each _laser_ that hits does one point of damage.  And since
you roll per turret in Traveller, if you hit, you do three points.  In HG,
you would roll by the battery, which would give you 30 lasers for 30 points
of damage.  With all the batteries the Tigress has, not to mention all the
bay weapons and spinal mount, it is sure to put a hurtin\' on whatever it
targets.

Black Globes are a kind of forcefield, with the disadvantage that while
they are operating, the ship cannot see or be seen. They can be set to
"flicker", which allows the ship inside to see and fire weapons, but then
their effectiveness is reduced. Nuclear Dampers put out an energy field
which inhibits nulcear reactions. I believe the Imperial Rules of War
prohibit the use of nuclear missles on starships (but of course other
powers don\'t neccesarily follow the rules of war, do they?)

Planets with Traveller UPP\'s - a number of planets are listed in the
library data with UPP\'s (a good thing) but these UPP\'s do not seem to be
explained anywhere. Sidebar pg 107 covers converting TL\'s & pg 123
covers converting planets other stats but nowhere is the UPP defined.  I
am glad to see the then but how will anyone without previous Traveller

is missing the TL as well.  Suggested fix - a sidebar explaining that
UPPs are the means the Imperium uses to charecterize planets & that is

On G:T p. 123 it states that the UPP code for size converts as follows:

0=asteroid belt
A=10,000 miles
a number=that number times thousands of miles

Size a size 6 world becomes: 6000 miles. Close enough for a conversion.

This one does need a fix for clarity.  I take it to mean the ship costs
36 points for possession (if not actual ownership), but only 31 points
if you take the loan.  There is no term specified for the loan, just
1/240th of purchase price payable to the bank each month.  If its
240 months, thats 20 years.

With the loan, its easy to understand how much an interest a character
has in the ship, but without the loan, there\'s no indication of how much
interest.

Alternately, the tech levels aren\'t linear. This has always been my take
on things: I just assume that the Scout Service was fairly arbitrary when
assigning codes, and leave it at that. Lately I\'ve just assumed that all
the codes are just a shortcut that the players know but the characetrs
don\'t, and that the characters just read a report that summarizes major
inventions and capabilities.

Last time I checked, a few years ago, the A-6 was out of service in the
bomber role.  \'The EA-6B Prowler, an Electonic Warfare specialty aircraft,
is still flying and looks almost exactly like the A-6, but with a pod on
top of the tailfin.  My understanding is that the Navy got really screwed
in their attempt to acquire a replacement EW aircraft and ended up spending
a lot of (probably not very efficient) money refurbishing 20+ year old
EA-6B airframes to provide this capability.

There is (If I recall correctly) an EF-18 in the works (or maybe that\'s
what got them in trouble) as a replacement.  They can only keep an airframe
flying for so long after all.  And Grumman (The A-6 Maker) was swallowed up
a long time ago in the massive defense industry mergers.

Thats how I remember it.  It was pretty cool for the day.  You could
take power from life support or phasers to put into the warp or impulse
drive and say stuff like "I\'m giving \'er all I can, Cap\'n."

When designing shpis now using FFS2, I like to figure out how much
power each significant item takes to run, and how much power each
G of acceleration takes for my thruster plates.  Giving this information
to the players allows them to crank up the Gs by turning some systems
off.  Weapons, screens, jump drive, anti-gravity/inertial compensators,
llife support, etc.

There\'s a Simon Green story in his Deathstalker series about a ship that
was carrying hundreds of colonists/refugees in low berths. It had to run
an Imperial blockade.  It made its escape, barely. But it had to steal
power from most of the low berths to do it.  Only a fraction survived.

I really liked the dramatic potential of that.

That\'s why I expanded the LBB system. Someone seems to have fornicated my
web site (and no word on how many months until things are returned to
normal), so I\'ll repost them here tonight when I get back on a Mac.

In essence, I created a simple way to create a trade good table for each
planet (in the same way that each planet has it\'s own set of animal
encounter tables). I\'ve amassed a list of basic good types (with core
prices and handling characteristics) that are modified/determined through
rolls and the planet\'s nature.

For example, rather than just getting "Manufactured Goods", the players
get a specific good with a unique lot size, resale DMs, handling
requirements... All the referee has to do is name the good.

Funny, but at the national archives, the training manual said 200, not
2000, years for archival acid-free bond. Assuming correct humidity, temp,
and not near any acid bearing paper. I\'ve seen 20 YO archival bond as brown
as Michael Jordan\'s Skin. I\'ve also seen 130 YO legal bond that was still
white and pliable.

Also, to achieve maximum lifespans, you have to keep it in a very closely
controlled temp, humidity, and preferably in properly supportive folders.
Mircrofil is the US Gov\'ts medium of choice for storage and dissemination.
CD Roms are rated at over 50 years (accordign to Popular Science, and the
Nat\'l Archives). Only reason CD\'s aren\'t used for archival purposes is that
formats are likely to change to readily, and US law requires minimal
machinery readable methods for archival storage.

Hmmm Xerox invents paperless computing...but makes all their money
selling copiers that _use_ paper. I wonder _why_ they they decided not
to put themselves out of business...

There were other reasons for them not developing the electronic paper
further at the time; mostly the electronic document creation
infrastructure hadn\'t caught up. IIRC the original stuff was developed
even before PostScript was, so no one really had anything to make the
stuff _on_ their electronic paper.

This technology is getting dusted off, tthough, there are a couple of
competing versions of the technology going right now.

I haven\'t done it yet, but I\'ve concidered an armed merchant which is
"under-powered" so that the PC\'s would have to decide to fight or flee.
Unfortunately a quick look doesn\'t indecate that the payout for reducing PP
is high enough to warrent, there isn\'t a real significant increase in cargo
space. Now when adding weapons to a previously designed ship would warrent
the allocation of power to systems...

One holoreader for the entire ship?  Equip your engineers with SHADEs!

WhizzoDyne TL9 SHADE 
Simple Holographic Adaptive Display for Engineers

A SHADE looks like a pair of oversized sunglasses attached to a set of
hearing protectors.  It operates as a miniature, personal HUD with
surround-sound speakers.  At one end is a port for holographic crystals
and on the other is a standard data port for connecting the SHADE to a
portacomp or other computer.  The SHADE allows an engineer or technician
to read manuals while actually working.  The SHADE can project
holographic views of equipment onto the inside surface of the goggles,
overlay these views on the piece of equipment being viewed, and allow
other technical data to be shown or read.

Lower tech devices are controlled through a portacomp keyboard or a
small portable joystick-piccolo control, while higher tech versions are
voice and eye-blink controlled (look at menu choices in the HUD and
blink or wink to select) and also provide voice response.

SHADEs also act as eye and hearing protective devices in hazardous
environs by automatically blocking out loud sounds and very bright
lights.

IMTU there are many competing operating systems, all of them are
compatible with the standard Imperial Data Packets, so software written
for one platform will work on all, it just may not be as fast.

The key isnt the space consideration, but the cost consideration.

In Traveller, power costs about KCr 100 per megawatt at TL12, and a
merchant ship wants to reduce costs to the minimum.

Therefore it should have about 5 megawatts \'over\' whatever it takes to get
and keep the ship in jump space - this is what I call the ship\'s \'jump
minimum power\'.

Basics (air, lights, sensors, computers) get first call on the power.

Maneuver drives come next. Note that merchant ships should *not* install
enough power to run the maneuver and jump drives simultaneously. If you
need to do \'running jumps\', install a battery pack that will get you over
the hump for the neccessary 20 minutes.

Now, whatever is left is your \'disposable power\' that can go to weapons. If
the power demand is more than (jump minimum power + 5), then you\'ll need to
install more fusion plant. 

Clearly, non-power using weapons are of interest to merchants. Sandcasters
are useful, and missiles also deserve consideration at TL13 and up
(allowing Heplar-using missiles with a small fusion power plant). But
lasers are good multi-purpose long range weapons, and it should be the
first weapon installed on an armed ship. Personally, I prefer lasers of
higher megajoulage than the \'standard\' 250 MJ output, on the grounds that
when you hit something, it should stay hit.

Think very very carefully when installing weapons that will take you over
your \'disposable power\'. Consider if a lower RoF is in order (needless to
say, take one laser that fires every 20 seconds than three that fire one
shot per minute).

If you go over your disposable power, think carefully about using batteries
rather than a bigger power plant on a merchant ship. Batteries are a *lot*
cheaper than fusion plant, and if you only plan to run the weapons in
combat, then one hour should be enough time - most civilian ships can only
take a couple of good hits anyway, so combat will tend to be short.

Ships engineers might want to consider the layout of the cargo bay and
engineering, with the intention of \'borrowing\' spare cargo space for
installing a battery pack if combat or a need for running jumps appears
likely (a battery pack that allows a running jump-1, enough collapsible
tankage to fuel it and a upgraded sensor array will allow a trader to run
from just about anything, if it is prepared to sacrifice the cargo space).

The explanation on pg 123 and pg 107 does not tell a GURPS player that
the numbers in the library data mean _anything_ or what order they are
in.  If you do not know that the numbers are a UPP and it is in the
Starport, Planetary Size, Atmosphere, Population, Government, Law Level,
(hyphen), Tech Level format the conversion notes will do you no good at
all.  Moreover as UPP\'s are not a GURPS concept they must be explained
away as something the _Imperium_ uses to classify planets or what the
heck are they doing in a GURPS product anyway (other than for we
Traveller grognards)?

So in order to understand page 36 you need to have read page 123 first? 
That is an very interesting [other words supressed to maintain the tone
of the list] design theory.  Using this same logic a cars instruction
manual would define driving the car on page 36 and starting the car on
page 123, with this sort of friendly design I am sure you have a great
future writing tech supposrt for software.

Moreover page 123 states "Planets - Thousands of planets have been
created for Traveller and hundreds for GURPS Space.  These tables allow
conversion between the two systems."  Notice that it does _not_ say
"This book will ocassionally use Traveller terminology without bothering
to define it or tell you when it is being used."  The use of the term
"size 6 world" will be perfectly understandable to thosee that knwo
Traveller and meaningless to those who do not - this is a BAD thing.

Let\'s go back to damp clay as a medium :) This means that you can let it
dry once you\'ve got the text right, and it won\'t be accidentally erased,
and if it\'s intended for permanent archiving you can fire it. As long as

I think Slag! comes fairly close to this straight from the book.  I and a 
couple of other people on the TML have posted comments about how readily 
Traveller ships can be converted to Slag!

Slag is published by BTRC and a pdf (Acrobat) format of the rules can be 
bought from hypermedia.com.

IMO Slag! is simple and fast, has a "SFB" feel and could easily cover 
Traveller ships in more detail.  One of these days I plan a conversion from 
various Traveller design sytsems to Slag! as well as Imperial Squadrons to 
Slag!

Some people don\'t like the loss of newtonian movement and acceleration, but 
I\'m not a big fan of newtonian games (c.f. Elite and Wing Commander or X-wing 
as computer games).  Slag! offers one hand wave around this; I just adopt a 
different technology IMTU where m-drive is replaced by something else (sub-c 
stutterwarp works well, as to numerous others).

So what\'s new?  These small differences don\'t worry me too much; if you compare

Actually, you can do this even if you don\'t have enough

Of course you then have to make sure the paperwork wasn\'t just
lost before you commit the resources you need to finding a
ship with communications that aren\'t much faster (if you are
lucky) than the ship you are looking for.   Of course if
the ship just changes ID (or changes back to a legit one....)

An example to the contrary doesn\'t speak to wether it was "uncommon",
nor does the example have the decentralized society as presented
in Traveller.  Finally, communications in that example are fast
and easy compare to Traveller.

hours were MUCH lower. They will have to shortly decide what to do with their
support birds. My guess will be F-18 and S-3 Viking frames as a stop gap,
until new aircraft are procured. The only ones happy about this are the Viking
drivers. They now have something to do besides ASW. They are bringing back the
30\'s Scout-Bomber concept. This is a good idea, as the F-18 while an excellent
bird, has very short legs. They are also adapting the F-14 into a Fighter-
Bomber. I am not crazy about this, as these planes are too large and old to go
low and slow, and they are the only planes in the fleet to carry the Phoenix
(still vital despite AAMRAM), and there are NO more replacement frames in the
pipeline. Any Navy pukes out there: If I made any mistakes, please chew me a

Shhhhh   don\'t give them to many hints (I told them that they had to

an orbit capible grav truck would work if you could get autorization

Well taking Marc sugestion of using the number of dice as the skill

(why didn\'t I think of that, its just so neat).

To remove an appendix under "field" conditions
  (dex+med) -4 for lack of proper equipment < average (2d)
  15 minutes

Now this is a 2d task so the prerequisite is med-2 (any reasonably
advanced
med student should be able to remove an appendix), but because its being

done without proper facilities it has a -4 on the target.

Eneri has med 3 and dex 8 (an average surgeon) he will succead on a 7-
Sharik has med 1 and dex 10 (a talented 1st year student) normally she
would
  have the same chance as Eneri, but because she has only med 1 and the
  task has a prerequisite of 2 difficulty is increased one level to
difficult
(2.5d);
  again she will succead on a 7- but due to the increase in difficulty
her
chance
  of success is less than Eneri.
Rojl has med 1, JoT 2 and dex 9 (a scout paramedic). While he only has
med 1
  his JoT skill boosts it to 3 _for the purposes of prerequisites_ only
so he
does
  not suffer the same increase in difficulty as Sharik. Also his JoT
skill
reduces
  the penalty due to insufficent facilities to -2. Thus Rojl\'s target
number on
2d
  will be: 1 + 9 - 2 = 8- (his JoT does not add to his med skill for the
chance
of
  success, but it does negate half the penalty). If Rojl had JoT 6 he
would
  negate the entire penalty, but the "extra" 2 points of JoT would have
no
effect.

After years of gaming i have come to learn that game books have these
problems. i read it all and learn it. Besides- Steve Jackson Games has been
better with easy to use layout and language than many game companies. Just
look how confusing some of the white wolf books are. Your complaint about
the book is minor compared to some of their problems. Yet the game is still
good. That is what\'s important.

LBB Supp 9 was Fighting Ships.  There weren\'t any plans in it, just USP\'s & 
descriptions & a rendering of the boat itself.  There\'s a 400 ton SDB in LBB 
Supp 7 "Traders & Gunboats", but it\'s not *specifically* refered to as 
Dragon-Class, unless you\'re refering to the dragon logo on the external view 
of the boat...

Hum, I\'ve got the second edition Basic game boxed set and it doesn\'t

In my World Building posts about two years ago on this list, I
got it wrong in one major respect. This is a corrected version.

The physical conditions on a planet, the cosmic abundances of the
elements, and the laws of chemistry practically dictate not only
what kind of envelope (atmosphere and hydrosphere) a planet has,
but what kinds of life are most likely to develop.

The principal physical conditions are size and temperature. Small
planets, moons, and so forth, are likely to be more abundant than
large ones.  Temperature is principally governed by how close the
planet is to its star and what kind of star that is, although it
it is also influenced by the atmosphere.

The abundances of the elements are also important. Hydrogen is
the most abundant element in the galaxy, followed by helium,
oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen in that order. Helium is a noble gas and will
be neglected.  The others are the Big Four of planetary
chemistry. Sulfur is the only element that comes anywhere near the Big
Four in importance. Halogens such as chlorine and fluorine are both much
less inportant and more likely to be locked into chemical combination; the
noble gases can be dismissed, and the rest of the elements are chiefly
rock-formers and metals.

The physical conditions shape the chemical composition of the
planet\'s atmosphere. Substances that have a low molecular weight
are most volatile and are easily driven off small or high
temperature planet. If they freeze, liquefy, or enter
into chemical combination, they may be retained on the planet\'s
crust and not affect its atmosphere. The average speed of a
molecule depends on its molecular weight and the atmospheric
temperature: while escape velocity depends on the worlds gravity.
Molecules with greater average speed than the world\'s escape
velocity will only be present in trace amounts. Those with
average speeds over about 10% of escape velocity are very
likely to be lost over geologic time periods.

Escape Velocity = sqrt(2 * gravitation * world radius)
(use 1 g = 10 m/sec^2 and world radius in meters) 
Most probable molecular speed = 105 * sqrt(absolute
temperature/molecular weight)

Randomly generated Traveller UPP\'s don\'t quite fit with this
closer analysis. You may have to tinker with either the numbers you
generate or with planetary history and conditions to get a believable
world.  YMMV: natural conditions often surprise us anyway.

IMTU, most ships have full data on Holocrystals. Many carry some form of
reduced size hardcopy (Microfiche is common... with a "Binocular"-style
hand-held reader. A few will carry most important ones in directly
human-readable formats as well. In almost all cases, the holocrystals are
also loaded into the "secured file area" of the library data.

>ObTraveller(2): How do ppl deal with operating systems for Traveller?

IMTU: Imperial Virtual Machine. A basic implementation of TL7 computing
which is required to be a supplier for Imperial Contracts. The IVM has
certain TL "Upgrade otpions" which require that the IVM have the correct TL
extensions. Local worlds may require IVM as the open standard, others have
multiple proprietary OS\'s... IVM itself is a virtual computational machine
with an integral OS match. IVM can handle text, voice, or GUI inputs and
outputs. The authorities don\'t care whether the physical machine is IVM or
emulator based, so long as IVM software runs on the machine without the
operator having to do anything special. IVM also requires a 4byte character
(32 bits), and supports  the IPA (Imperial Phonetic Alphabet), anglic, and
vilani character sets in native mode, with code page changes for other
character sets available. IVM includes IPLS (eye-plus, Imperaial Program
Language Stadard), which is often available for non-IVM platforms. I assume
that computer-1 skill includes some knowledge of basic IPLS, and each
additional level of computer or JoT allows one other programing
language/environment. MilSpec programs use the IPLS+ (eye-plus-plus)
extension (related to IPLS like C++ is to C), and  each skill possesed by a
character that could use with a computer inclused some knowledge of the
IPLS standard extension for that field IF the character has computer 2+ or
Computer 1 & JoT 1+. Research skill includes knowledge of the ISE search
system (comparable to any of the modern search/database engines/query
languages). Since few player characters tend to settle down IMTU, I haven\'t
needed much more detail. I assume that IVM includes a basic multi-language
capable text engine/browser, and support for multiple sound and image
formats, and, at TL 9+, holographic imaging formats.

If it was a one-book set, it was the first ed.
Having both, Second Ed doesn\'t have it, but the starship combat simulator
for 2nd ed did.

LUG\'s TNG RPG doesn\'t explicitly have a bridge simulator, but since ship
combat is task based (and who makes the rolls is listed), it comes fairly
close.

IMHO, the bridge simulator approach worked well IF thoroughly (and
ruthlessly) implemented. I did one for SFB at one point (was running a ST
RPG with homegrown rules, and using SFU of SFB)... Here\'s how I\'d break
down the setup for Traveller:

Captain: Tactics rolls (for descriptions of probable courses of enemy
action and initiative). Captasin prohibited from using rules mechanics
terminologies... everything from the skipper MUST BE IN CHARACTER.
Helm: Actual maneuvering, all the maneuvering rolls.
Navigator: not much in combat, may help with certain helm tasks. May double
as sensor and/or commo.
Sensors (or navigator if no Sensor Officer): all detection rolls, sensor
settings.
Commo: makes all communications rolls for coordination with NPC ships.
Usually seconded to either sensor or navigator.
Master Gunner: Allocating Targets to batteries, making all the rolls for
NPC run batteries and/or the one battery at his control.
Chief Engineer: allocation of engineering tasks, and making all NPC
Engineering rolls.
Security Chief: Allocation of security forces, making all needed "loans" of
NPC\'s to others.
Purser: Keeps track of passenger and cargo losses. Loans personell to other
departments.

For trek, I had several other positions.... ForEx, the CEngr did power
allocation to other officers, who used their cut for their tasks. He had to
have new plot ready by time new SFB turn came around....

IMTU, it\'s gold laminated onto a non-metalic substrate for "Original".

as for the US National Archives, I assure you (as a former employee) that
they don\'t even tell the truth about all their holdings.... and most
offices (on the pre-archival side, which simply means the originating
agency still owns it, also known as the "Recod Center" side) have vaults
with classified materials which often are not on the pulically available
finding aids, but are in the staff-only ones...

I\'ve seen a finding aid (unclassified, BTW) which included "Roswell, 1947,
50CF" held in one of the record centers.... in the army air corps files,
IIRC. But, since it was in the record center, it is technically still
property of the US ARMY!!! The USAF cannot get to it, as it is an army
record, save through the army. So the aair force legitimately can say they
don\'t have the records. Since the army owns them, the archives doesn\'t and
says "we don\'t have them", even tho physical custody is with the National
Archives, since they are on "Courtesy Storage". And the records themselves
ARE clasified. But not the finding aid. I think somebody slipped (they were
not at the office I was at, which had nothing classified except student
records) and put them on the master list of record series (which was always
at least two years behind).

Makes me wonder... How much can be gleaned by a good search of the finding
aids in the various imperial archives. Even if you don\'t get access to the
documents themselves.... If they are anything like the US National Archives
system, finding anything will be hard to do... you have to know what you\'re
looking for, what finding aids to look in, what euphamisms will be used on
the finding aid, and who generated it in the first place to find anything.
But boy howdy, you can find out just how much they DON\'T want you to know
by what is listed as "restricted access".

Laminated is *bad*, because the differing materials *will* delaminate
given enough time. And "crystal" is bad because it will break give
quite minimal stresses in the wrong directions.

I\'d be interested in something like that stuff they make some envelopes
out of. Something-tex. It\'s a "spun" plastic. Get something like that,
but with a fluorocarbon base. Then the hard part is what you use to
mark it with. My best guess would be impregnating it with some stable
but colored compound at the time of manufacture. 

For *really* long term, you want characters chiseled/molded into some
sort of *durable* rock/metal. 

My idea of a "long term" archive (intended to survive past some great
disaster) would be built into a *stable* rock formation. Here on Earth,
the Canadian Shield would be good. 

You mark the location with everything from large scale rock/earth
formations, to embeded radioactives and magnetic markers in the rocks. 
Which gives me a thought. Once we have a suifficiently active presence
on the moon, we *really* need to check out the center of the Mare
Oreintalis basin. That giant "bullseye" is probably natural, but it\'s
also a *natural* place to bury something to be found later. I\'d want to
check it for alien artifacts.

Anyway, once you get into the well sealed vault, you\'d have the rock
carvings or inscribed metal plates. They\'d contain enough info to
(hopefully) enable the finders to decode the more compact media, which
would be the bulk of the archives. 

Alas, you *can\'t* use even molecular level (much less atomic level)
encoding in anything intended to be readable after millions of years.
That\'s because the atoms and molecules will *migrate* on such time
scales. Items in contact will merge/weld.

So the "smaller" sheets would be in some sort of racks, so that they
won\'t be in contact. And they\'ll have an ample margin, so that if
necessary they can be *cut* free from the frames (which they\'ll have
merged into).

But you can do the say with various sorts of "cast rock" or metal, and
it\'ll be *much* harder to break. Rock is more brittle, but has better
corrosion resistance than most metals. Platinum/iridium alloy is both
strong *and* stable. But *expensive*. 

I rather like the artifacts from Footfall. Giant granite(?) cubes with
writing cut *completely* thru the block.

Here the change is that all the characters (with only demo 1) have the difficulty 
increased by one level (2.5d) so their chances of success are
Three - 3%
Seven - 43%
Eleven - 91%

This requires skill 3 (hum, maybe the half die shouldn\'t count as a skill level). 
so the task gos up two levels to 4d, giving chances
Three - 0.1%
Seven - 5%
Eleven - 34%

With the extra training Eleven is as good as Three at simple tasks, but as the 
tasks increase in complexity (requiring greater skill and experience) Eleven\'s 
chances will start to drop off dramatically. Assuming Three increased his skill 
to 9 his chances for the three tasks would be
Easy - 100%
Average - 100%
Difficult - 91%
Formidable - 74%
Staggering - 34%

By comparision Eleven\'s chances are:
Easy - 100%
Average - 91%
Difficult - 34%
Formidable - 12- on 6d (I haven\'t caculated the percentage chance)
Staggering - 12- on  8d (ditto)

Obviously Eleven\'s raw talent can compensate for his lack of skill and 
experience at most Easy and Average tasks, and give him a shot at difficult 
tasks. Beyond that point his lack of training and experience result in his 
chance of success effectively dropping to zero. Also due to the half die, the 
penalty for attempting a difficult task with skill 2 (professional level) is relatively 
minor.

However in these examples there is no change since they all have skill 3 
(sufficent for difficult tasks)

I found using my system of prerequisites you need to have the half die there for 
difficult tasks or they become too hard for characters with professional level 
(level-2) skills.

roomy airframe to do these sorts of tasks (E6B, Viking if employed in that

need a fair number of operators working to have a good broad-spectrum
capability (E6B has 2 dedicated EW op positions, by contrast the old USAF
EF-111 had the EW op also acting as a nav officer, I assume).  Much of
this work can be done electronically, but you still need the \'human in the

This seems to be an SJG tradition; on the map of Autoduel America in GURPS
Autoduel, Grand Rapids MI has migrated from the west side of the state all
the way over to the east side near where Flint used to be.
I guess when the Food riots hit, Flint must have become depopulated and
Grand Rapids must have been loaded onto a BIG flatbed truck and moved down
I-69....

Gee, if they try leaving it in orbit, someone might try to match velocities

Not neccessarily, you can build a very nice little business by sticking to

It\'s quite sad to think that somewhere in a junk shop lies just such a

This is a sort of a philosophical post. Just some things that are (sort of,
allowing for the fact that, in theory, its all a game) disturbing about
Traveller\'s background and the way it has developed.

Does anyone else on the list find that the political philosophy as expressed in
Traveller is anti-democratic?

The Imperium is a repressive dictatorial authoritarian regime based on a mix of
might makes right, power based on social stratification, divine right of kings
etc. Sure, *in theory* the Imperium is all sweetness and light ... but it allows
(and encourages) the Megacorps to rip off the people for a Credit, as long as
the Emperor gets his share. It suppresses technological development. It
manipulates and destabilises member regimes (sure, the ones they do it to in
published adventures are ones that you and I would probably say deserve it, but
look at what the Ine Givar supposedly wanted ... per their manifesto/background
on Pyramid). It rips off innocents for its own socio-political ends (as per
Milieu 0, but not limited to that Milieu by any means). It promotes the worst
sort of radical laissez faire capitalism coupled with organised monopolistic
practices.

Worst of all, the underlying assumption of everything that has been published in
recent years is that all of this is inevitable.

MTrav and the TNE sequel to it was about how decadent all the power groups
within the imperium were, at their base. All of them. Even Norris.

Milieu 0 is about the worst sort of might makes right dictatorship, with real
parallels to european fascism in the 1930\'s in attitude (if nothing else).

GURPS Traveller and CTrav are not as tainted, but the underlaying assumptions
are still there, just not as obvious.

Now we are being told that the Late Terran Federation was a repressive regime at
least as bad as that of the Vilani Ziru Sirka.

And we all sit back and accept it.

I mean, doesn\'t anyone out there realise that the way things are going is that
*you* are playing the Imperial Stormtroopers and supporting the "Dark Side"? The
Emperor is *not* a nice guy. The Imperium is even actively (if unintentionally)
malevolent in its release of Virus.

Everything in the game is becoming tainted by this.

What is wrong with the people out there? Do they think that democracy is so
useless and fragile that it cannot last ... well, its been around almost as long
as authoritarianism, and keeps on keeping on. Our current democratic traditions
owe much to the ideals of Greece and Rome (especially the Republic), ideals that
never died even under centuries of authoritarian rule.

In countries all around the world, countries where there has never been a
democratic tradition, people are struggling even as we speak to build democratic
institutions ... some paying with their liberty and some even with their lives.

It seems fairly obvious that, once you reach a certain level of education and
material prosperity, the much despised "people" start wanting more than the
generosity of authoritarian regimes. They want a real say in power, they want
some control over it themselves. Look at Iran and the Shah, Indonesia and
Suharto, probably Malaysia and Mahatir. Look at Taiwan and its rejection of KMT
authoritarianism.

And look at India. A democracy since 1947 ... with mass illiteracy and mass
poverty on a scale that is really staggering. Yet, despite Pakistan\'s example of
what can happen in such a developing situation, India has remained a democracy.

Of course, the idea of a powerful stellar empire is an old one, dating back to
the golden age of SF ... an age when democratic ideals were under attack
throughout the world, and it looked like democracies were in retreat. But the
idea of powerful stellar federations/leagues/confederacies etc. is at least as
old.

Why is Traveller so caught up in this anti-democratic fervour? Is it an American
thing? Why?

Other SF RPGs are not so backward ...

The Jovian Chronicles: A mix of democracies and non-democracies.
Heavy Gear: Ditto
ST:TNG RPG: The Federation is a democracy.
The Babylon Project: A democracy of sorts
FTL:2448: Democracies.
That Awful Rolemaster SF Game whose name escapes me: Democracies and
non-democracies
Star Wars: The struggle between the Rebels (who are democratic) vs the Evil
Empire
Space 1889: Mix of democracies and non democracies
Space Opera: The main guys, the Terrans, are democratic. The Mercantile League
is a sort of oligarchic democracy. The Confederacy are democratic (or would be
if they could throw off the evil Korellian empire)
Fading Suns: Well, you got me here!

Sure, you *could* argue that some of the planetary governments in Traveller are
democratic. So what? The main game is with the big boys. The Imperium. The Evil
Empire.

There is an assumption, evidently deeply rooted, that democracy dies out at some
time in the near future (or during the early Interstellar Wars) and that it
never re-emerges. That it cannot, it seems.

Admiral Estigaribbia stages his coup to supposedly protect the Vilani from
Terran exploitation, but declares himself emperor rather than, say, President.

Nope, there\'s something seriously wrong with this line of thinking, or so it
seems to me.

What do the rest of you think?

If I may make a humble suggestion...

It needs to made explicit that different characteristics can be used with
each skill.  In the example given, Three might be a clumsy genius (INT 10
and EDU 12).  With his Demolitions-1 skill, he might be able to complete
the floowing tasks:

To identify a booby-trapped package:
Int+Demo, Average (2d6)

To recognize the characteristics of the explosive used:
Edu+Deom, Difficult (2.5d6)

Thus Three can still be a useful character even at low levels of talent..
his strengths lay more towards the theoretical end of the spectrum.  When
partnered with Eleven, who is a bit of a dunce (INT 5, EDU 3) they make a
good team.  Three tells Eleven what wires to cut.

Sometime yes. When I read 76 patrons I find adventurers kidnapping, breaking

Since I\'m sort of the person responsible I\'ll explain its not all quite as "black" as 
it seems. When it was founded the TC was faced with the overwhelming 
juggernaut of the ZS, a state so big it could crush them without blinking. The 
Terrans only chance was unity, therefore it didn\'t seem so bad to its early 
government that those who vocally called for the preservation of the crazy 
patchwork of soverign nations be "gently" silenced; it was wartime after all and 
they were just removed to the colonies or interned for the duration. Then as the 
Wars started to bite and the society gradually became more austere and 
authoritarian and the Vilani threat became more real; their responses slowly got 
more draconian. At its foundation the TC was a democracy, and even when it 
fell it was still a democracy of sorts (pre 1st WW Germany or current day 
Singapore would be good examples). It was certainly more democratic than the 
military dicatorship which followed it. And it was as a response to the 
subversion of the Terran democracy that the very democratic Old Earth Union 
was founded during the long night and survived until it was incorporated by the 
Imperium.

a bibliography they had _never_ printed out) that person had a _number_ of

   Hydrogen rules: it is more abundant by far than any of the
other elements.  
   It also has the lowest molecular weight of any ordinary gas,
and the lowest boiling point of any except helium.
This makes it the most volatile. The smaller or hotter a planet
is, the faster it will lose hydrogen from its atmosphere.  
   Compounds of hydrogen and other elements, for instance water,
methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide, also tend to be light 
and to have low boiling points. These are also easily lost from 
small or hot planets.  
   Finally, hydrogen may be driven from its compounds by ultraviolet
radiation. The hydrogen escapes, leaving the heavier element to combine
with something else.  Any planet smaller than a gas giant is likely to lose
hydrogen as it ages.

   All this means that hydrogen content makes a good yardstick
for comparison of planets.
   At the high end of the scale are the gas giants, which are
mostly hydrogen. As a matter of fact, any planet than can retain
substantial free hydrogen is likely to belong in the gas giant
class. Small gas giants, such as Neptune and Uranus, become
progressively more enriched in the less volatile elements and
compounds. 
   At some point smaller than these but somewhat larger or cooler
than the earth, there is a cutoff point, where a planet cannot
retain its hydrogen but can retain its heavier volatiles. These
are "middle hydrogen" planets, and are the most likely places for
life to originate.
   At some point only a little smaller or hotter than the earth,
a planet loses all its hydrogen-containing compounds unless they are in a
frozen state. These are hydrogen poor planets, though some are poorer than
others. The earth itself is a borderline case: although it has retained
substantial water, like the middle hydrogen planets, most of it is liquid,
a condensed state.
   This has little to do with atmospheric density. For example,
Mars and Venus are both hydrogen poor, but one has a very thin,
and the other a very dense atmosphere.

    Helium is next most abundant, but since it is chemically
unreactive, it will be ignored. It is very nearly as volatile as
hydrogen, but since it does not combine chemically, it is
virtually absent from any but gas giants.
   Helium is important in cryogenics and superconductors, which
are used heavily by high-tech societies. This makes gas giants a
vital industrial resource for such worlds.

Yes.  The ZS was a totalitarian state.  The TC *became* a totalitarian
state.

I don\'t know that this can be considered "canon."  Same goes for the Ine
Givar write-up on Pyramid.  Even if it is, if you don\'t like it, don\'t
use it.

I think part of it is due to the basic assumption that the speed of
communication is limited by travel times.  That Democracies are
inefficient under such circumstances, over such vast distances, and are
therefore not feasible for controlling an area of space greater than a
subsector or two.  

An American Thing?  I beg your pardon.  As one who has stood guard over
George Washington\'s Tomb, I can tell you that democracy is still alive
in the U.S.

IMTU, it is still alive on countless worlds both inside and outside of
the 3I.

larger book (although I suppose it would save space if I left out such
minor details as prices and tech levels... :-)

What about 102 Vehicles? Hereby also neatly establishing a precident for
sequals to other 101 books.

More to the point, if you want to see it you could write to Andy Lilly
asking him for it.

Alternately, I suppose I could publish it as a PDF file (having finally
got Acrobat) with the printing turned off.

This has been my take on things for years. 

Mind you, it may have been suggested to me in a letter from either Loren

Having a game\'s authors telling me to ignore the rules if I didn\'t like
them gave me the confidence to stand up to the munchkins and become a

My own house rule was to limit the attribute to a multiplier of the skill.
Ordinarily this was 2, but it ranged from 1-3.

This meant that a chap with medic-1 and dex-12 would only have an asset of
3 for most tasks. "Obvious" tasks could use an asset of 4, while for brain
surgery he would have an asset of 2.

This meant that having a great attribute gave you more potential ability,
and made each level of training more effective (compared to someone with
lower natural ability).

Yup. The Imperium has always been a fuedal system, _not_ a democracy.
Taken as a gaming background it makes internal sense, which is all I ask

Yes.

This, from my perspective, is good. It explains why the players in many
published adventures have been routinely at odds with the Imperium. Not
for mere selfish motives, but from an honest belief in personal freedom!

Or I\'m playing the Nazi diplomat who saved 20 000 Chinese during the Rape
of Nanking. Or the students in the White Rose resistance group.  Or a
miner struggling to organize against the combined forces of company and
state police. Or...

I _like_ playing the underdog.  I like players who take morals into
account when gaming, and a mortally B&W universe takes away this aspect of
gaming.

>What do the rest of you think?

I think you\'re (a) reading too much into a game background, and (b) about
20 years too late to complain about Traveller\'s Imperium.

On gaming: I\'m quite certain that Traveller (and other games) are
fictional, and I\'m also certain that any Traveller players that can\'t tell
the difference have psychological problems that a different game
background won\'t cure.

Off gaming: I\'m seriously worried about the resurgence of corporatism
around the world.  The MAI (as it stands) scares the shit out of me. 
Being told "work harder for less money, because our company must be more
competitive" by a man earning millions in "productivity bonuses" while our
stock plunges makes me look for convenient lampposts and some spare rope.
While democracy has its flaws, I\'ve seen nothing better, and I would live
under no other system. (And, for the record, I do not equate "democracy"
with "the American system of government". There are many forms of
democracy, but I believe that all of them are better than any other
alternative.)

In summary: While I\'m disturbed by world events, I don\'t see a trend in
Traveller, and I\'m not worried about the game\'s "history".

    The next most abundant substance is oxygen. There is enough
oxygen in the galaxy to combine with all less abundant elements
with some left over. For the most part, oxygen also combines with
these other elements better than hydrogen does, and its compounds
are much less volatile. Rock is chiefly oxides of the metallic
elements. Hydrogen-poor usually means oxygen-rich.
   Free hydrogen and free oxygen are never found together in
nature for very long. Given a few microseconds to a few thousand
years, depending on conditions, they combine to form water.
    The good news for us water-drinkers is that water is the
single most abundant compound in the universe. The bad news is
the old spaceman\'s lament...water, water, everywhere, and not a
drop to drink.
     Stars are far too hot for water to exist as a compound. It\'s
present in gas giants, but since it\'s denser than hydrogen, you can expect
to find it mostly in their lower layers. (These are no place for for beings
with ideas of space travel to go looking for it). If you don\'t mind it
being strictly a mineral, there\'s plenty of it in the outer reaches of most
star systems. If you want to melt it, find a place with some atmospheric
pressure. In vacuum, water behaves like dry ice and sublimes instead of
melting. Since water vapor is a volatile, fairly lightweight gas, it\'s easy
for asteroids, moonlets, and anything else that gets close enough to a star
to lose its supply to space. (There\'s plenty of it there too, if you have a
few thousand years to spare collecting it from a few cubic AUs of excellent
vacuum.) 

Thus far, we can expect:
     The high-hydrogen class of worlds will have a mostly
hydrogen atmosphere with some water. Since water in any state is
denser than hydrogen, it can be expected fairly deep within it.
   The middle class may have water with a little hydrogen, water
and other gases, or water and a little oxygen.
   The hydrogen poor class will have little or no water in the atmosphere
and more free oxygen than water vapor in any case.

This classification is still too crude, and life needs more than just
water. The next of the Big Four is needed.

This was an excellent post, and crystallised for me some things that I had
been thinking about regarding the role of the Imperium in a Traveller
campaign. Good job, Phil. I\'ll add a few comments here about certain
points.

This last one especially occured to me after reading all the things in
GURPS Traveller from other science-fiction sources that DON\'T exist in
Traveller. Now, some of those things were developed as concepts in sci-fi
long after Traveller was first published...but some were not. And yet,
Traveller does not have them...or do they? Vilani "conservatism" is often
blamed for why certain advancements, such as artificial intelligence, are
not pursued...maybe the same thing is true when it comes to, oh say,
faster-than-light radio? What if the plans and specifications for Jump
Radio DO exist...and have for centuries...buried in a warehouse somewhere,
because of the obvious difficulties such communication would cause for the
Imperial hold on power?

Yes, many of the business practices of the Imperium would not stand up
under today\'s anti-trust laws.

Well, the Reformation Coalition as seen in TNE were attempting to aspire to
democratic ideals...whether they could have survived when faced with the
Regency is a matter of some debate..and the Regency did seem to be moving
toward having some kinds of democratic reforms, although that could have
been just "throwing the people a bone".

As I said, Norris did seem to want to take at least some power out of the
hands of the nobles and put it into the people\'s reach, in TNE at
least..but your statement is fundamentally accurate, IMO.

I\'ve gone back and re-read the Mileau 0 Campaign Book, and I have to agree
that Cleon I comes off as far more ruthless and unpleasant than he does
honorable, and maybe that\'s the only way a government like the Imperium
gets established...

Well, my players, particularly my wife the history/poli sci person, have
definitley noticed this, and she has commented that she doesn\'t much like
the Imperium. She plays Traveller and enjoys the adventure, but vastly
prefers Star Trek as a background because she sees the Federation as a
democratic ideal (and I think she also enjoys the break from long travel
times and too much "real science" <g>) They seem to be moving in the
direction of playing "Robin Hood" and aiding people against the Imperium
from time to time..and therein may lie the reasons that so many Traveller
campaigns seem to drift in the direction of lawbreaking...if the society is
not just, people will rebel against it, even in small ways. (Admittedly,
this doesn\'t cover most merc/pirate campaigns, but it seems to be what is
happening with ours.)

Well, both Greece and Rome had certain problems with their "democratic
ideals", such as it only extending to men, only to "citizens" (and the
concept of who was and was not a citizen was fairly narrow) etc. But it was
a start. Actually, the Vikings had the closest to our democratic ideal,
IMO.

Traveller reflects the thinking of people like Asimov, etc. in the fact
that it\'s Imperium resemples many of those empires. What interests me is
that in books like Asimov\'s, Poul Anderson\'s Flandry series, etc. these
governments are almost always born to die..it is SHOWN that such an empire
cannot last. And yet, people got really upset when the Imperium fell, as it
inevitibly WILL fall someday. It was very likely the WAY it fell which
annoyed people, but still, it does make me wonder sometimes...IMTU, the
Imperium is rotting and decaying from within, and it\'s days are most
definitley numbered unless VERY REAL change happens very quickly...which it
likely will not.

I do think we Americans (at least many of us) have far less confidence in
our government, and therefore our democracy, than we used to, when it seems
like all our leaders are corrupt and you can almost watch the whole thing
collapsing from within sometimes...it isn\'t too late YET to stop this
trend, but it might soon be...

And allowing democratic planets to exist within the Imperium may eventually
be the cause of it\'s downfall....because it is there that free-thinkers can
spread their ideas, where rebellions can be born. The Imperium would have
to begin quashing such worlds eventually..and this could lead to even
greater problems.

However TNE was also about how the collapse gave everyone another chance.
The Rengency is much more democratic than the Imperium ever was, and the
Coalition is most definately a democracy (though not all its members are).

That is one of biggest gripes with M:0. I don\'t have a problem with the
lack of democracy, but I did find the almost total lack of morals in the
early 3I\'s leaders disturbing.

The lack of scruples and accountabilty of nobles and megacorportaions was
pretty obvious in The Traveller Adventure.

From what I\'ve read I would suggest that these ideals were honoured more in
the breach than in reality in Rome, and in Greece (only Athens, really)
they were only for a small minority. Even the most open Greek democracies
were really just unusually open oligharcies. IMO democratic government is a
fragile thing, though the ideals are not. However I don\'t think that it
will fade away and die, never to return, as the ideals are just too strong.

If it\'s anything like the TV series it\'s (IMO) little more a democracy than
a number of so-called democracies in the thrid world today are.

If you mean SpaceMaster it had a democratic state, but it was a small and
struggling backwater compared to the Imperium. This was actually another
reason I was so dissappointed with M:0 - SM already had an empire built by
an alliance of greedy power hungry megacorps and would be nobles, so to me
M:0 felt very much like a clone. I had always felt that at least Trav\'s
Imperium, for all its faults didn\'t start as an exercise in profiteering
and repression, and that it was at least a bit better than the alternatives
(well the Solomani, anyway).

IIRC even the there was a large (49%) faction of the Terrans who wanted to
turn the Terran holdings into an empire and take over the UFP on the basis
that it would be a better way to run things. I always found it cuirous that
for the same TL being a democracy seemed to allow you to have better gear,
and being a non-democracy tended to give you a lower TL.

Well in The Traveller Book it states that an empire is assumed because of
the size of the state and the slow rate of communications. I would suggest
that no matter what type of government you had there would be a fair amount
of corruption in a state that size (so what we see in The Traveller
Adventure could happen), but really didn\'t like the way the 3I was made
\'evil\', in MT to a degree and more so in TNE (but at least TNE only looked
at the late Imperium that had disintergrated into the Rebellion), and then
in M:0 we found that the 3I was explictly morally bankrupt right from its
inception. Because of M:0 I feel that even in G:T\'s no assassination
timeline the 3I must inevitibly come apart, because if it doesn\'t the bad
guys win.

>Admiral Estigaribbia stages his coup to supposedly protect the Vilani from

I never read it this way. I always felt that it was a power grab by the

Yes, 100%. It would be foolish to disagree.

The government of the Imperium seems heavily based on that from the Asimov\'s
"Foundation" series. Both the Foundation series and Traveller say that this
method is the natural progression for an interstellar community with
"hyperspace"/jump travel in the fashion that both implement it.

Not that I agree with it.

I don\'t find it to be disturbing though. First of all, it\'s a game, and it
really doesn\'t get to me. Second, I can shape it to my will as game master.
It can be relatively benevolent in some areas, or completely corrupt.
Sometimes, it can just merely be functional with no real leanings one way or
the other (the way I perceive my own government usually).

Just because my players are running characters in a game world doesn\'t mean
that I (or they) have to agree with it. In fact, not agreeing with it can
make adventures far more fun.

Thanks. I have incorporated your suggestion as:

Demolitions-1 skill, he would still be well-suited to the following tasks.

	Three can still be a very useful character on a Demolitions Team but the

Three tells Eleven what wires to cut.

Looking at the rules, the capabilities of various Psi\'s in various shows,
it would seem that non-linguistic communication requires a mind meld, and
as a corollary, surface thoughts are at least semi-linguistic.

this reinforces the idea that surface thoughts are linguistically oriented.

or the language could be a holdover from before the telepahtic gene became
prevalent in the population.

another thought: betazoids, by the LUG TNG rules, get RECEPTIVE telepathy.
So, you\'d need to get someone\'s attention if you want them to hear your
thoughts. How many betazoids are also projective telepaths (Tam Elbrun pops
to mind).

Democracy is a short-lived thing in history. No democracy has ever lasted
more than 300 years of unbroken democratic rule without breaks of autocracy
or violent rebellion that breaks away. Even Great Brittain has had periods
where their "democracy" has been temporarily shelved for autocratic rule
(especially the war of the roses, IIRC). Britain\'s form is the most stable
yet seen. The US is coming close. Both have strong autocratic tendancies...
CF GB/North Ireland, and the US and it\'s colonial dependancies (Am Samoa,
US VI, PR, Marshal Islands), and the US and any third world it thinks it
can get away with "Policing".

The great greek democracies weren\'t really total demos either... they would
elect an autocrat during time of war.

The US and UK, while they have democratic principles, are actually
parliamentary systems, with indirect (and occasionally virtual)
representation.

AFAIK, Switzerland is the most democratic gov\'t of more than 10K people
governed. and I\'m not really sure about that.

In 200 years, will the rash of democratic gov\'ts still have any democratic
features left?

What about "Soviet Democracy" - Yea or nay for the candidate. And, if the
nays have it, a new candidate.

What about Weimar Deutchland, where the Chancellor was transferred
autocratic rule, then proclaimed himself Fuhrer...

There are 82nd and 101st Jump Troop Lift divsions (20-Factor, TL14).  Awhile
ago, I was interested in seeing what exactly was present and wrote down the
ids and pertinent info on every unit chit for I:E...

Anyone notice there\'s a TL12  1C-Factor Lift Corps of Ihatei fighting for the
Solomani?  That\'s certainly interesting.  There were quite a few of those that
I was unable to identify.  Some of the Imperial (and Mercenary) units were
meaningless to me (the name the leader, maybe?) ...

It gets even stickier than that, IMTU.  Let\'s use the 504th Parachute
Infantry Regiment (one of my personal favorites, the "Devils in Baggy
Pants", I went to Sinai with them) as an example:

Early in the First Interstellar War, when most TC ground units (and
naval units, for that matter) were from national contingents, the 82d
Airborne Division [hereafter simply "the 82d"] was trained and equipped
for meteoric assault (Jump Troops).  At the time, the US Army had
reverted to a regimental, rather than brigade, system for maneuver
elements in a division.  The 82d had, as it has now, three regiments: 
the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment [hereafter "the 504th PIR"], the
325th Airborne Infantry Regiment ["325th AIR"], and the 505th Parachute
Infantry Regiment ["505th PIR"].

By the end of the Nth IW, the 82d had each of its regiments on a
different world, spread from Terra (Divison HQ at Ft. Bragg, NC, USA)
throughout the former Ziru Sirka, each still identified as 82d Airborne
units.  This remained true throughout the Rule of Man.

Fast forward...

It\'s now the M:0 setting.  The 504th PIR (which, BTW, hadn\'t conducted
an aircraft-based parachute assault since AD 1989 [Panama/Just Cause],
happened to be stationed on Sylea when things fell apart all those
centuries ago.  As military organizations are wont to do, the 504th PIR
maintained its traditions, and still identified with the 82d.  It was
used, with its number and designation intact, as the basis for the 82d
Jump Troop Division, Imperial Army.  Later on, as other worlds were
recontacted, the 325th AIR was located and integrated into the 82d JT
Div, IA.

Meanwhile...

The 82d\'s Division HQ, along with the 505th PIR, remained on Earth when
things fell apart, and formed one of the combat divisions of the Old
Earth Union.  When the Solomani Autonomous Region became the Solomani
Confederation, the 82d JT Division, Confederation Army, was one of its
most prized units.

Thus, you run into the chance of two divisions, each carrying the same
designation and lineage, with equivalent capabilities, wearing the
_same_ division patch, engaging each other in combat.

BTW, this is the kind of trivia that actually is important in our

Yes, but IMTU, there is a long-standing minority democratic
faction in the Moot. As long as they don\'t incite armed rebellion
against the Emperor or his officials, they are tolerated as mostly
harmless.

Could a group that is in principle opposed to the whole idea of the
Imperium actually support it?

Yes, I realise Traveller has always been an Imperial Government. However, in the
TLBB days, there was so little detail about exactly what the Imperium *was* that
it could have been a "democratic" Imperium.

The "dark side" is very much a creation of the MTrav and later rules and related
supplementary materials. So, in a sense, we can blame DGP and, to some unknown
extent, GDW of the DGP era, for the trend.

In that case, yes, I agree with you ... but there is also the assumption that,
as far as the basic rules and non-adventure specific supplements are concerned
that the players will be *part* of the system.

This is what I find *very* disturbing. If, somewhere, it was laid out plainly
that the Imperium was *not* a nice place, and that Imperials are the good guys
only occasionally, more or less by accident, and only ever in comparison to
*really* black evil, well, I could go along with it.

The assumption all through the material available is, however, the Imperium are
the "good guys", the "white knights" ... when they manifestly are *not*.

Yes, and I have no doubt that some do (I always did) ... but there are going to
be a *lot* of people out there who, while not killing 20,000 innocents (well, on
second thoughts, maybe they are? <sigh>), *are* playing the Stormtrooper and
"just following orders".

How unusual are you and your campaign? That\'s what I really want to know.

How many people out there *do* play the "Resistance" and *do* make it plain that
the Imperium is *not* the "white knight"?

I don\'t get the first sentence there ... are you saying that Traveller says that
Democracy cannot die out? Or that it doesn\'t die out? I would, personally,
dispute both assumptions.

There is ample evidence in the published material to support my feeling, too.

b) No. The Empire of TLBB Traveller was *not* the "evil empire" ... this only
starts with the Rebellion (perhaps the very late CTrav stuff).

And the reason for complain is that it seems to be getting worse. More
ingrained.

True. I\'m simply commenting that no-one has commented on the trend in Traveller
so far, that I\'m aware of.

For example, at the time of its original release, I deplored the *stated fact*
in "Warhammer" that chaos (= evil) WAS *GOING* TO WIN. That there was, quite
literally, NOTHING the players could do about it. I thought it was in
questionable taste at best (but, then, I\'ve never liked Moorcock\'s work,
either). There was no point ... everyone and everything was tainted and doomed.

Warhammer 40K was worse, it was actively *sick* ... the idea of the Emperor
there was, well, frankly disgusting. It would have been right at home in Nazi
Germany.

It worries me that Traveller seems to be, perhaps, going the same way (but not
that far, of course!).

And there are a lot of people, within and without governments, that are coming
to realise that the resurgence of American inspired laissez faire capitalism is
*NOT* a good thing. That because the US won the Cold War does *NOT* mean that
the American economic and political structures are suitable for the rest of the
world (or even for America). And I suspect that there will be a severe reaction
- -- even George Soros seems to have finally figured this out, and is probably
worried that *his* head is lined up in that noose (figuratively speaking).

OK. It was just a thought.

   The Third Imperium was founded on the premise that central authority is
the only proper way to run an interstellar government.  Sure, local people
can make local decisions about local problems, but there needs to be
someone overall in charge.  This is what seperates a crazy, chaotic sea of
disparate star systems from an interstellar government that has a uniform
system of trade regulations and a centrally controlled military force that
can protect all the systems more efficently from outside invasions.

   As with any hereditary monarchy, the degree of freedom that individuals
have is dependent upon the virtuousness of the ruler\'s offspring.  It
should be noted however that levels of oppression in a particular region of
a large empire will always be relative.

   That the person who is ultimately in charge of the very regulatory
agencies that would prevent unnecessary exploitation of the masses also
stands to gain monetarily from that exploitation (thus is put into the
ultimate conflict of interest) has not escaped my attention.

   It would take a *very* special kind of service oriented individual not
to exploit such a situation.  You might even get one about every other
generation...

   Name one government that doesn\'t.  OK the USSR had a socialist economy,
but if you think that the people really benefited from the exploitation of
their labor that took place under central planning, I\'d like to suggest
that you have your medication changed.

   Just as the fall the Galatic Empire is inevitable in the Star Wars
triology, no?   Story arc is a personal decision of the author(s).

   Decadent power groups, or people caught up in the whirlwind of events?
If Norris took his cues from Machiavelli, he can hardly be blamed, IMHO.

   As I generally take everything in "T4" with a large grain of salt (no
more than would be found in a typical salt mine), I think not sure that
what you are reading is necessarily completely authoritative.  I prefer to
think of it as one point of view or interpretation of a complex historical
issue (similar to the American expansion into western North America).

   Again, different takes on the same complex issue.  I\'d *prefer* a canon
explanation, but...

   Confederation.  Anyway, you are talking about a government and a people
that had been in a state of emergency martial law for generations.
Eventually the masses think of the rationing and the curbs on freedoms as
being normal, and all that nonsense about inalienable rights as being so
much philosopher\'s BS.

   Outside the context of the game, the Imperium (and the Solomani
Confederation, Aslan Hierate, etc.) are only as good or as evil as you want
them to be.

   Authoritarian regimes called monarchies were around long before
democracy.  Democracy in the sense that we think of it (universal suffrage,
etc.) is a 20th century concept.  Yes, I *know* what the US Constitution
says, but certain minority groups (African-Americans in particular) had
their voting rights routinely taken away as late as the 1960s, whereas
women didn\'t get the right to vote nationally until the 1920s.

   Democracy is a fragile thing that can only exist in the most stable
countries.  Democracy is failing in Russia right now because it is becomng
unstable.  Revolutionary France (obstensively democratic) was highly
unstable and therefore Napoleon was the result.  Thousands of years of
human history show us that authoritarian rule or benevolent dictatorship
have been the rule and democracy (or anything resembling it) is the exception.

   Democracy therefore is a precious gift of modern technology and thinking
and not to be taken for granted, or surrendered lightly.

   Most in vain I\'m afraid.  You can\'t grow orange trees in Alaska for a
reason.

   Iran traded the dictatorship of the Shah for the dictatorship of a
religious elite.  Yes, Suharto is gone, but those that will replace him for
the next few years will likely only be transitional figure until the next
strongman takes charge.  While Taiwan *is* democratic, that democracy will
vanish if/when the government in Taipei decides to move closer to the
central government in Beijing.

   India has a corrupt government in which the bureaucracy has too much
power and politicans take far too many bribes.  That\'s not me speaking,
that is individuals from India I\'ve talked to speaking.

   Cyberpunk: Oligarchy exploiting the masses

   GURPS: depends upon your take

   There are other examples as well, but suffice to say that democracy is
not necessarily a universal concept.

   I\'m not sure where you are going with this.  Are you recommending a more
generous interpretation of the Imperium as in CT, or are you suggesting
that perhaps the whole concept of the Imperium be scrapped?

   If you read the TNE material, you saw that things *were* headed in the
direction of democracy in many regions.  The Reformation Coalition is a
democracy for the most part, or at least it has a representative from of
government.  The Regency is also headed in that direction as well.  It
would have been interesting to see what would have developed in the end,
but oh well....

Heck, have the contract be "FOB xxxx orbit". That means it\'s up to the

Well; according to the rest of the world, us Yanks are trying to take over the
world through economic exploitation...:-). Seriously, though I think that most
gamers are like me. I just thought of it as an enjoyable game, with an
extensive history. This is the first time that I thought of the Imperium as
the evil empire. I guess it is really up to the SM to decide how to run the
Imperium.

I never got the impression of the 3I as the bad guys from MT. Misguided,
perhaps. Fragile, definitely. Fractured, Absolutely. Irreperable, No. Hell,
based upon careful placement of certain quotes, and good manipulation, I
even caused several "Pro-Lucan" players to have their CHARACTERS become pro
Dulinor. I would much rather there have been the shatter, and a resolution
to the civil war followed by rebuilding the shattered imperium.

I did always have the impression of the 3I as a morally bankrupt but
thoroughly ethical government. They DON\'T violate their own rules, and
don\'t allow violations to go unpunished. They Do uphold a series of values:
the Credit, the Nobility, Noblesse Oblige, A strong military is the best
defense, Personal Honor is a requirement of leaders. They don\'t dictate
morality, nor any other ethical standards, to wit, they do NOT actively
support "Lazze Faire" capitalism at all... (no tax base there) nor do they
support command economies. They allow anything that keeps the imperial
nobility and credit afloat....

Also, IMTU, nobles tend to maintain dueling codes, especially for dealing
with nobles who lack a sense of Noblesse oblige.

It\'s true that the Monitor sank off the Carolina\'s in a "moderate" storm
(almost gale conditions.)  She was found and was declared a "National
Historical Monument" in the mid 80\'s. There was an attempt to lift her
"intact" from the sea floor that failed miserably about 10 years ago.  I
believe that they eventually recovered the bulk of the "metal" parts and
they are still being processed for preservation.  It is against the law to
dive on the sight and especially remove something from there.  This is very
difficult to enforce because as it turns out she was in way less than a
hundred feet of water, somewhere around 65\' - 85\' IIRC.   Even though the
"metal" parts are removed there are still thousands of pieces on the ocean
floor just in case you feel like breaking the law.  The article was "Cover
Story" in National Geographic about 10 years ago if you want to look it up.

Bryan, although I don\'t have the CD (waiting for the next release),
I downloaded 2.4 from Jim\'s site and installed it when it was first
available. I also downloaded it Friday and installed it to a new

The beauty of GURPS Traveller is that there is already a GURPS supplement
covering that warehouse.  It was originally located on Terra (remember the
end of Raiders of the Lost Ark?) but it could be anywhere by now - even the
Spinward Marches.  

It\'s called Warehouse 23 . . .

And they should get their butts kicked for it.  The Seventh United States
Cavalry Regiment was established in AD 1866 - *after* the American Civil War.

The regiment\'s official motto is "Seventh First".  They are usually called
"Garryowen" for the word on their crest, which was one of their more
infamous commander\'s favorite Irish drinking songs.

I work for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - the
guys responsible for maintaining the Monitor Marine Sanctuary.  Besides
the Monitor, there are quite a few other marine sanctuaries, and places
declared off limits.  
With today\'s budget, I\'m sure the number of patrols through these areas
aren\'t what they used to be.  

NOAA is in some ways similar to the IISS (even more so if you add the
Coast Guard too).  I would imagine budget cuts at the IISS would result
in reduced patrols and reduced maintaince of warning buoys around Red
Zones.

Their brokers are buying and selling goods for them, thus they are thier
own customer.  You don\'t want to leave a cargo in orbit until the broker
can sell it, some morally-challanged individual would pick it up.  Or
the port authority would pick it up for littering the parking orbits.

Hmm.
Perhaps temporary -1 Str and -1 End per month in micrograv?
(-1 ST, -1 HT for G:T)
With one week in standard grav to recover each point?

This reminds me:  Are there radiation sickness rules for Trav,
somewhere?  I was thinking of converting the stuff from

Well, from orbit, FAS (Free Along Side) might be a more appropriate
term. But if you want to get this detailed, check out the Uniform Commercial

Code.  Here is the relevant portion.  If you go to the source URL,
you can click to more detailed information on particular terms and other
Code references.

Bloo


http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-319.html


 2-319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. Terms.

(1) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means "free on board") at
a named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is

a delivery term under which

     (a) when the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at
that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this Article (Section
2-504)
     and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of
the carrier; or
     (b) when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must
at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there
tender
     delivery of them in the manner provided in this Article (Section
2-503);
     (c) when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or
other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load
the
     goods on board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the
vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions
of
     this Article on the form of bill of lading (Section 2-323).

(2) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means "free
alongside") at a named port, even though used only in connection with the
stated
price, is a delivery term under which the seller must

     (a) at his own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel
in the manner usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the

     buyer; and
     (b) obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the
carrier is under a duty to issue a bill of lading.

(3) Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within subsection (1)(a) or
(c) or subsection (2) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions
for
making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading
berth of the vessel and in an appropriate case its name and sailing date.
The seller
may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation
under this Article (Section 2-311). He may also at his option move the goods
in any
reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipment.

(4) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer
must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller
may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution
for the documents.

    We can expect most life in this galaxy to be carbon based,
for two reasons. First, carbon is better suited for forming
complex organized structures than most other elements. Second, it
is thousands of times more abundant than any of its potential competitors. 

   On Hydrogen rich worlds, carbon is likely to be found in the
form of methane.  Methane has a lower atomic weight than
water and a much lower melting and boiling point, so it is more
volatile. It can be expected most in the atmospheres of gas
giants or in the ices of outer systems. Only the larger or cooler
of middle hydrogen worlds can be expected to retain much methane.
   Carbon and oxygen react better with each other better than
either does with hydrogen. A planet that can\'t hold its hydrogen will start
losing it from methane as well, as

methane + water = carbon dioxide + hydrogen.

The hydrogen is also easily stripped from methane by ultraviolet light:
Given half a chance, methane containing bodies tend to develop carbon
coatings.
A complex series of hydrocarbons and carbohydrates may also occur as
intermediates in these processes. As long as there is water available, life
can be supported:

1) water + energy = hydrogen + oxygen.
2) methane + oxygen = water + carbon dioxide
3) methane + water + energy = complex hydrocarbons + hydrogen
4) carbon dioxide + water + energy = complex hydrocarbons

   Methane and free oxygen will not coexist for long. The rate of 
reaction may be slow by human standards, but is rapid by planetary ones.
   Carbon dioxide is more stable than the monoxide and there is
almost always sufficient oxygen to convert the monoxide to the
dioxide, so carbon monoxide will seldom be seen.  It is also by
far the heaviest molecule yet considered, and will be retained in
a planet\'s atmosphere better than any other common gas. It is likely to
dominate the atmospheres of hydrogen-poor worlds unless there is some means
of removing it.  It may escape, be frozen out, (as almost, on Mars) or get
locked in the crust (as on Earth).  This last option requires liquid water
to help dissolve it and the metallic ions it can combine with: dry worlds
(like Mars and Venus) get stuck with it in the atmosphere.

  The third equation suggest that the methane breathers of science fiction
are actually plants! The animals would be hydrogen breathers. The odds are
stacked against methane-hydrogen ecologies, except on gas giants or in very
young planets. Not only is methane one of the more volatile gases, but an
extensive methane-consuming, hydrogen-generating plant life would tend to
drive a planet\'s evolution toward the hydrogen-poor end of the scale.
However, it is possible. On earth, there is a group of terrestrial bacteria
(methanogens) that use cheaper sources of hydrogen than water and convert
complex hydrocarbons into methane and water, extracting the energy for
their own use.  Higher forms of life are imaginable.
   The last reaction is familiar to us. Terrestrial organisms
run it both ways. Water is still required, but life processes can still
take place on otherwise hydrogen-poor worlds.

Snipped a bit too much. Sorry.

Traveller history is only _one_ future history. The fact that a democratic
interstellar government doesn\'t last in the Traveller history is a
statement of historical fact (from a fictional Traveller perspective). I
don\'t see it as translating into Travller implying that a democratic
interstelar government is impossible. Although I\'ll admit that, given the
limits on communications, any democratic interstellar government would
have to rely on trusted representatives or take a _long_ time to make
decisions.

Well, yes, it probably is, but Traveller should not be seen as an expression of
political philosophy.

I think that in terms of providing a background for a far flung interstellar empire
it\'s quite reasonable (in terms of "it could work this way", rather than "I\'ll vote for
that"), at least by the time of MTrav. The various people who run the imperium, and
those who could challenge them, all have a vested interest in the stability of the
imperium. They will do whatever is possible to maintain that stability, which includes
some fairly underhand tricks.

As a result, the imperium runs as a loose confederacy for general purposes. Worlds can
maintain their own governmental systems and legal systems, can even manage other worlds
as (very) miniature empires, but must submit to the authority of the imperial agencies
- - the army, the navy, the ministry of justice, even self-proclaimed agencies like IRIS.
They also effectively submit to the private agencies of the MegaCorps, since the
MegaCorps are each more powerful than any individual world.

The nobility system, at the system level, can only mean anything within the context of
the local government type - many nobles will be like today\'s King of Greece - he gets
invited to the royal occasions of other royal families, but has zero standing in Greece
itself.

Now, at some point this imperium has to establish itself, hence Milieu 0. The other
method would be for the individually settled worlds to come together at some point,
like the European Union or (presumably) the Star Trek federation. The Federation, by
the way, seems to be entirely run by Starfleet (with the exception of the doddery old
fool whose assassination was prevented in Star Trek VI) and if you want to look at an
anti-democratic organisation in Science Fiction, that gets my vote.

MTrav was an attempt to destabilise the Imperium using the old Raymond Chandler plot
technique of "man walks in with gun". All the stuff about decadence (and there wasn\'t
much) was just post-rationalisation. But I think MTrav (and the Digest material
published shortly before it) did a good job of fleshing out the Imperium and showing
how it had to work, although it still erred too far towards the noblesse oblige of the
nobility. I think in general the nobility are not so much motivated by high principle,
than by power, comfort and money.

TNE\'s main aim, from my perspective, was to make the Traveller setting one which was
appropriate to the construction of miniatures rules. But one of the other things it
tried to do was discredit the imperial setting and "fix" some things, like the
democracy issue. I think that had some interesting implications in the regency (where
the noble tier was extracted, but a hereditary monarchy was sustained), but for the
Coalition, you just ended up with Twilight 2000 in space. As predicted.

This is a poor analogy. Fascism was distinguished (if that is the word) by its
irrationalism. Milieu 0 is just realpolitik - it\'s "great power" empire building.

You need to read more history. Our current democratic tradition (yours and mine) owes
little to the "democratic tradition" of Greece and Rome and more to the philosophical
thread that runs back through Paine, Rousseau, Locke and Hobbes. And that was mostly
based on Christian ideas of original sin. Parliamentary traditions trace back to the
Viking and Saxon assemblies, to feudal diets and medieval republics like Venice. Some
of the names, I\'ll grant you, trace back to ancient times, but were taken up by 18th
century liberals who romanticised Greece and Rome, rather than being directly descended
as part of a grander tradition.

Most of classical Greece had nothing like democracy. Athens, the principal and best
known democracy, was not a representative democracy in the modern representative sense
- - each citizen had a direct vote, and the general effect was of mob rule. To qualify
for a vote, you had to be a freeman. Athens\' female population, and its very large
slave population (even Aristotle realised the Athenian economy was dependent on slaves)
did not qualify.

Roman political philosophers generally denigrated Athenian democracy. Under the Roman
Republic, the senate was made up of the members of patrician (ie noble) families, and
the senate elected the consuls. From 494 BC a veto was introduced which could be used
by the tribunes (elected by the plebeians) to constrain the executive power of the
consuls, but this hardly constitutes a representative democracy.

Both Athens and Rome would establish authoritarian regimes in times of crisis - these
were the original meanings of the words "tyrant" and "dictator". Both Athens and Rome
attempted to construct empires. Athens foundered as a result, whereas Rome succeeded.

And the idea of democracy did die out for very long periods of time, even in Western
Europe, and in parts of the world has never existed at all. For most of European
history since the fall of Rome I\'d bet the average Western European\'s idea of a perfect
government was one which strictly imposed the tenets of Christianity, rather than one
which reintroduced ideas which were effectively lost until the Renaissance.

Traveller\'s just a setting. It\'s a good setting, which makes for interesting
adventures. The political setting is just realistic enough to have genuine political
adventures. And the characters can question the politics if they like (unless it\'s TNE,
where that would get them vented).

I don\'t think you can portray history as a golden procession from autocracy to
democracy, or even as a natural progression. In a couple of hundred years time the
spread of parliamentary democracy will probably be seen as something imposed by the
cultural and military dominance, initially of Britain and France, and then of America,
and enabled by considerable improvements in global communication. Traveller
reintroduces the communications issues which make global resistance difficult; while I
think it conceivable that democracy would prevail, I don\'t think that an effective
democracy could be sustained across Imperial space in the face of the communications
issues raised by jumpspace - ie a large state covering the space of the imperium would
be difficult to govern as a single entity by democratic means - it would keep falling
apart, like Italy. (;-))

Spacemaster. Guess what, it\'s an empire ("The Terran Star Empire"). And I actually
thought the background was OK, parts of it even better than Traveller, though I dislike
Rolemaster rules.

Surely thou jesteth. It\'s a mix of what was around in 1889. The main terran powers are
Germany (monarchy) and Britain (theoretically a constitutional monarchy, effectively an
imperial bureaucracy).

You forgot:
2300AD: mostly democracies. Britain gets a romanticised monarchy.
Twilight 2000: anarchy. Groups of stranded American soldiers forcibly impose their idea
of order on the still smouldering remnants of Western civilisation. Most reprehensible
game setting ever.

I think idealising your system of government is a bad idea, because it stops you from
questioning it. To look at 2300, if you\'re playing "America good; France/China bad"
you\'re missing a chunk of the game, as well as a chunk of reality. In the real world,
governments are not directed by good and evil, but by means, ends and interests.
Remember that, and you\'ll have a more interesting game.

Whatever, with Traveller, if you don\'t like it - make your own universe.

I\'ll finish with a quote from Virgil:

"Make it your task, Roman, to rule the peoples by your command; and these are your
skills: to impose the habit of peace, to spare those who submit, and to conquer the
proud"

They should put that on the front of Milieu 0.

It\'s far worse than you thought. The Navy is still dithering over the
CSA (Common Support Airframe), that will pick up the load from the
(gone) KA-6B tanker; the EA-6B EW aircraft; S-3 ASW aircraft and C-1
delivery a/c.

Currently, the S-3s are doing mostly tanker work, along with F/A-18s
carrying buddy stores.

However, the S-3 has actually lost the ASW role. This really diminishes
the carrier\'s contribution to task force ASW.

The F-14 is going... to be replaced with more F/A-18s.

ObTraveller: Has anyone considered using multiple types of small craft
from the capital ships - strikers configured to attack capital ships;
fighters to fight small craft; and some form of EW aircraft to help get
past the capital ship\'s defences?

1960s Technology. There are already some companies that scan all
incoming (snail) mail, to minimise paper in the office. IMHO, they are
setting up for an almighty fall unless they have their disaster recovery
down pat.

(We looked at this kind of system for a part of where I work a couple of
years back, but it was seen as too high a risk - and manpower intensive
for the scanning!)

IMTU, there is a time and a place for paper. That time is when the
computer is broken; and the place is wherever you can\'t get a spare
computer.

Why bother in future? People have already cut out the paper in fax.
transmissions - PC-fax-PC. Especially if you have a non-volatile, robust
storage medium like crystals.

Perhaps some documents can only be binding on a hard medium. Personally,
I\'d be having those articles inscribed on platinum or somesuch, rather
than on paper (one careless laser discharge...)

Hopefully. If some, erm, person has just EMPd your ship, perhaps the
backup readers are not in such a good state either.

That works both ways, too - it\'s hard to go ahead with your TL16
computer when it has to be backward compatible with those TL11
dinosaurs. Look how crippled Windows 95 is by even vestigial backward
compatibility.

My players are quite often either agents of the imperium, loyal citizens
with a slight criminal bent, or spys for the others (Solomani or Zhodani,
who are worse by far).

Try reading "The Clouds of Saturn" by Michael McCollum.  He has vast
floating cities in the atmosphere of Saturn.  Due to a solar disruption the
population of Earth had to relocate or die, and they came up with living in
an inhabitable area of the GG\'s atmosphere in sealed cities.

Pretty cool, and ripe for a Traveller setting.  No FTL drives, and the
Maneuver drives were mostly inatmosphre.

Enjoy!

The Imperium is _evil_, and the corporations certainly rip off the
commoners (or more likely, rip apart, if needed). I like the background
this way.

I do not have characters in my campaigns playing Imperial military. They
are more like rogue traders, making a profit where they can, and
occassionally helping people. Sort of like Han Solo in Star Wars, but in
the Traveller setting. The Imperium and the corporations IMTU are evil,
greedy entities who only really care about money and themselves.

I guess my Imperium is a really dark place to live in, but I do not have a
problem with that. Things get more interesting this way, since the major
force in the known universe is NOT on the characters\' side. This promotes
running, quick-thinking and trickery, instead of calling for backup from
the friendly government. The characters probably hate it, but the game
gets _much_ more interesting this way. I and the players in my group like
it anyway.

I like the MT task system, but prefer the T4.1 one. As for playing the
game, I use T4 merged with CT (background and starships) and MT
(background) with a dash of TNE (for Survival Margin - the best MT
supplement, ever).

Both the LBBs and MT were standalone if you bought the boxed sets. CT had

Blatent Plug -  101 Lifeforms (published by BITS) has plenty of creatures
which could be used for pets. Some are nastier than others...... such as
the dreaded Pandyflo. Indeed, you can have fun trying to spot the
inspirations for the various creatures in the book.

Hear! Hear! We spend too much time slagging of the poor Foss art in T4 and
not noticing the good material. I liked the Elmore stuff - it had a real
flavour to it.

To be a little heretical, I *liked* the cover on the T4 rules, and some of
the other books (NAM, FFS2, MoS, PI, TAR, IS). The T4 cover looked like a
low tech type A free trader. Shame about much of the rest of Chris Foss\'
material.

That would be Roderick Derroch Elliot, member of my currently-moribund

every NPC is as morally corrupt and borderline psychotic as the Famille

I have forwarded your query to him. He\'s pretty busy these days, since

Supplement is not rules set!  

Comparison is not valid!  

I\'m gonna sit back and listen awhile; several, more eloquent than me, are
presenting these two thoughts, even as I write...  ;-)

The Seventh United States
Cavalry Regiment was established in AD 1866 - *after* the American Civil War.

The regiment\'s official motto is "Seventh First".  They are usually called

Are you sure of the found date? I\'d thought the 7th was around during
the early "Indian Wars" (when a lot of Civil War cavalry commanders
earned their combat experience). If not, no big deal - an occaisional
running gag in my Traveller campaign was glaring errors in ancient
Terran history. What, you didn\'t know that the Irish painted their

rule, but only as long as they propitiate the howling masses. At every

it from being an oligarchy is the facade that must be preserved, lest

The scary part to me was the way the corruptions, the bad decisions 
accumulated into an unstoppable force. The leaders could see how
their actions were not making things better, even making things
worse. Their earlier actions, and the actions of leaders before them,
had painted them into a corner that shrank almost daily. As long as
they could keep up appearances, they could be in charge of a large
interstellar state. When things started to slip, they could very well
be dead. And it did not appear, even if they had the knowledge and

    'body' => 'Nitrogen 

     Ammonia lovers find that the universe is biased against
them, too.
     Nitrogen is less than a tenth as abundant as carbon. On gas
giant types, it is commonly found in combined form, as ammonia.
If there were no oxygen or carbon to be considered, this would
force a ammonia-in-excess hydrogen or ammonia-in-excess nitrogen
split, just as oxygen does. Nitrogen has an odd atomic number and
odd number of combining electrons, which makes its combinations
with oxygen a bit complicated and those with carbon even worse.
    Unlike hydrogen compounds and carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides require
energy to form: they are not normally present in large amounts. If they do
form, they tend to spontaneously decompose to a mixture of oxygen and
nitrogen. (Sound familiar, Terrans?)  The nitrogen oxides can be stabilized
somewhat by reacting with water (as in nitric and nitrous acids) or with
hydrocarbons.
   Nitrogen can combine with carbon, but not easily. A little bit of
hydrogen stabilizes the compounds, as in hydrogen cyanide. These are fairly
easily oxidized to nitrogen and carbon dioxide if oxygen is present.
      Ammonia is somewhat more volatile than water, (lighter and
lower-boiling) but somewhat less than methane. This puts it more on the
high-hydrogen end of the scale. 
     As with methane, a planet that can\'t hold its hydrogen is likely to
start losing it from its ammonia as well, with nitrogen as the remainder.
(as on Titan and Earth). Ammonia is somewhat closer to water in its
properties, so it might stick around a bit better than methane.
    The difficulty is that a planet that can keep its ammonia is even more
likely to keep its water, which is up to a hundred times more abundant in
the first place. Ammonia dissolves quite well in water, and dissolved
ammonia acts as an antifreeze. This could extend the life zone into colder
regions. On the other hand, once dissolved, there are plenty of negative
ions for ammonia to react with: it might get locked up in the crust.
    Ammonia-oxygen atmospheres are unstable: they rapidly evolve to
nitrogen-water instead. (@#$ Terrans again)
   Given that the carbon compound-water reactions are the basis of
life, the inclusions of nitrogen and ammonia broadens the
possibilities somewhat.  The reaction
Nitrogen + water + energy = nitrates + ammonia;
is an interesting possibility. There are terrestrial bacteria
which run modifications of this reaction in both directions. If ammonia is
present, it\'s likely that some amount of cyanides are, also.
   Nitrogen atmospheres are familiar to us earth-dwellers and probably come
next after carbon dioxide atmospheres in importance on hydrogen-poor
worlds. Nitrogen remains a medium-weight gas even when the hydrogen
containing compounds and carbon dioxide freeze out.

Sulfur
     This is even less abundant than nitrogen, and is a major
component of planetary envelopes only in exceptional cases.
     Sulfur has a volatile compound with hydrogen: hydrogen
sulfide. In a hydrogen poor environment, Sulfur does tend to form
chains as carbon does, but it cannot form the side branches and
multiple rings that make carbon chemistry interesting and
complex.
    In an oxygen rich environment, sulfur combines with oxygen to
form sulfur oxides. These, like carbon dioxide, can be
mineralized and locked up in the crust. When other volatiles are
gone, sulfur and sulfur oxides are next in line. In Sol system,
there is Jupiter\'s satellite Io with its sulfur volcanoes, or the
sulfuric acid clouds which have scavenged what little water
remains on Venus.

No, but it\'s been noted that the ancient Terrans dated their calender from the 
Toruture of the Christ Gang: Elvis, Karl, and JFK Marx, a.k.a., the Marx 
Brothers.  On some planets there even is a St Elvis Cathedral, affilliated 
with the One True Roman Catholic Church (Elay Synod).

You can grow orange trees in Alaska just fine, as long as they are in a
greenhouse. [I have seen them.]  To continue the analogy freedom is a
fragile plant which needs nurturing but can be made to grow in any type
of political soil.  The notion that an authoritarian culture is destined
to remain autoritarian is a bit of an overstatement it might bw more
acurate (IMNSHO) to say that cultures without traditions of freedom
_tend_ to remain authoritarian.

Using FF&S2 :-
Fuel rate (m^3/MW-year) is 0.15m^3 liquid deuterium (0.14 tons/m^3), or
0.1m^3 liquid hydrogen (0.07 tons/m^3).

If we \'fuse\' deuterium completely to helium-4, 1/5000 of fuel mass is
converted to energy as per E=mc^2.

If we \'fuse\' hydrogen (protium) completely to helium-4, 1/1800 of fuel
mass is converted to energy.

The reactors in FF&S2 burn 11.5% (deuterium) or 12.5% (hydrogen)
of their fuel, assuming 80% plant efficiency (50-60% prob\'y more
realistic) and 90% efficiency in generating electricity.

So : basic fuel rates - 23 L / MW-year deuterium
                      - 16.6 L / MW-year hydrogen
with an \'60/90\' power system.

Looking at GURPS Vehicles :-
GURPS TL    Plant Weight (lb)
9           (1 X kW)+ 20000
10+         (0.2 X kW) + 2000
Volume = Weight / 50 (cubic feet) for all plants

Internal tankage isn\'t going to be a mass problem ; it may be a
volume one, however...

It\'s a little more obvious than the above quote would suggest :-
momentum is not being conserved, hence the term
\'reactionless thruster\'. This is the physical law being mangled.

A rocket accelerates because it throws fuel out the back.
Initial momentum overall is zero.
The rocket moves forward as the fuel moves in the opposite direction.
Overall momentum for the system of rocket and fuel is always zero.

(Snide aside :- As written in FF&S2 :-
High-efficiency AG : 0.0007 MW / kN thrust - 700J (1 Joule = 1

Bloo wanted some rules re radiation exposure.
There are also some DGP rules which appeared in
an issue of the Traveller\'s Digest way back when,
if you want those.

Hope this is of some use.

Subject: Rads

Re: Radiation T:2000 rules

Effects of Exposure:  Exposure to lower levels of radiation will produce 
temporary illness, while higher levels can ckill.  All exposure is 
cumulative.  When a character\'s accumulated rads reach or surpass 50, he 
must be checked for radiation illness.  Thereafter, each time the 
character accumulates one or more rads he must be checked for radation 
illness.  however, the character is checked for radiation illness only 
once per day on each day that he accumulates additional rads.
	The Radiation Illness Chart (below) gives the multipliers used to 
determine the chances of illness and death from exposure to radiation.  
Use the rad level on the chart that is closest to (without exceeding) his 
accumulated rad level.

Rads	Slight Illness	Serious Illness	Death
50		1.0		nil	nil
100		0.5		1.0	nil
300		0.2		0.5	1.0
400		Auto		0.2	0.5
600		Auto		Auto	0.2
800		Auto		Auto	Auto

	Multiply the character\'s Constitution by the multiplier to 
determine his target number (round fractions up).  Roll 1D10.  If the 
number rolled is equal to or less than the chance, the character avoids 
the effect.

Slight Illness:  Nausea, vomiting, and headaches.  Onset is 1D6 hours 
after exposure.  The character has strength, agility, and intelligence 
halved for the duration of the illness.  Symptoms last one day at lower 
levels, two days if exposure is greater than 600 rads.

Serious Illness:  First suffers slight illness, as above,.  Then suffers 
serious illness and is incapacitated with severe vomiting and diarrhea, 
spotting on the body caused by bleeding under teh skin, and blood int he 
stool and vomit.  Onset of serious illness is 2D6 days after exposere at 
levels less than 300 rads, 1D6 at levels above that.  Incapacitation 
lasts 1D6 days, plus one day for every two days spent without bed rest 
and medical care.  The amount of medical care required is the same as for 
a character with a serious wound to two body parts -- or two additional 
body parts if the character is already wounded.  General illness, 
approximating the effects of slight illness listed above, will persist 
for 1D6 weeks.

Death:  The character first suffers from slight radiation illness and 
then from serious radiation illness.  During the incapacitation period 
(and usually within 30 days of exposure) the character dies.

	At higher tech levles, presumably an automed could treat slight
and serious illness at increasing levels of exposure, and a full medical
facility could prevent death, and "roll-back" a persons cumulative
exposure.  The description in FF&S of the consequences of getting too
close to a Fusion Drive suggest that bone marrow transplants etc, would be
necessary, so presumably the character is till going to be laid up for
some time. 

	*Apologies to those not interested in radiation, but enough people 
had expressed an interest that I thought it was worthwhile.

How is this for a location for the Warehouse?

"Tarin Sink/Corridor 1432	D AE3301-6

Tarin Sink is an Imperial client state and site of Corridor Research
Station Epsilon.  The planet was colonized by nine extended families
during the wave of spinward expansion in the late 300\'s.  Most of Tarin
Sink\'s modern inhabitants are their descendants.  
Later, the Imperium constructed a seperate research facility staffed by
its opwn personel.  This station grew until it was officially designated
Research Station Epsilon.  Epsilon serves as a clearinghouse for
unexplained phenomena.  Within it are records of bizaare happenings and
mysterious relics dating back tens or hundreds of millenia. 
Untranslated nonhuman acounts and strange engines predating the First
Imperium await the person able to read or operate them.
Many items in the station\'s collection are so odd that they are freely
displayed to the public, although Tarin Sink\'s position within the Great
Rift limits the number of visitors.  Imperial researchers, completely
baffled by these objects, hope that someday, someone will pass throug
the station who can shed some light on these mysteries." - Library Data
of the Corridor Sector, Travellers Digest #18 pg 34, DGP 1990.

Tarin Sink has always been one of my favorite potential settings for an
adventure.  Acess to Tarin Sink will require a ship capable of Jump 4 or
a misjump.  The library data already suggest a Warehouse 23ish place
about the only change I might suggest making is establishing that the
Warehouse was moved here earlier, perhaps by the Rule of Man.

Ah, but is it a *correct* premise? The Terran Government, prior to the current
work of the TWG which is evidently making them out to be just as fascist as the
Vilani and the 3I, was at least assumable to be based on an assumption that it
was possible to have a democratically based interstellar state.

The Old Earth Union (until the TWG changes the existing implications <sigh>) was
also implied to be at least vaguely demorcratic.

There is at least as long a tradition in SF of democratic style interstellar
states being feasible as there is of Imperial states. I would, personally, argue
that the imperialist stuff was OK as an assumption in the 1930\'s, but I would
have thought that it was not the appropriate ethos for the late 20th century/

Personal opinion, of course.

Don\'t dispute the idea that some*thing* needs to be in charge. I reject the
assumption that it has to be a dictatorial some*one*. Why not an elected
"someone"?

And the World\'s Postal System works quite well without any dictator in charge?
What is the problem with some sort of interstellar customs agreement ... one
based on either no-one in specific being "in charge", or on a democratic basis?

But they are *arbitrary* ... which is the universally bad thing about
monarchical regimes. You are relying on *luck* ... at least with some sort of
democratic organisation you can vote the bastards out in something short of an
interstellar civil war!

Mainly, I guess, what I am saying is that the fact that the Imperium *is* a
suboptimal socio-political system ... the "bad guys", if you will. It should be
spelled out for the morally challenged <grin>.

Nope, to keep themselves in power. Technological development is, ultimately,
destabilising ... as the people in charge rely on some sort of technological
limitation to keep themselves in power (arguably in a republican democracy this
is based on the impracticability of a town meeting style situation running the
country ... computers may change this, eventually, which would be a worry to the
current crop of legislators ... if they had enough of a clue to realise the
possible implications!), and occasionally must have enough of a clue to
recognise that new technologies would threaten their position. This is why, I
think at least, the Imperium is so technological backward compared to the
strides the Terrans made before they were corrupted (OK! OK! The TWG now tells
us they were already corrupt, which is part of my kick)

Did I mention the USSR?

I mentioned radical laissez faire capitalism!

Not something the USSR was reknowned for!

Regardless, I think that there are actually governments, other than the
ex-superpower and current superpower, who actually do *not* promote radical
laissez faire capitalism, do not intentionally rip off innocents etc. Sweden.
Switzerland. Most of the Euro-socialist countries ... Australia, Canada. Lots
more.

Just because the USSR and US don\'t work <grin> doesn\'t mean the rest of the
world doesn\'t!

Yes. But the storyline of Traveller is that the Imperium is not being replaced
by anything better ... the Reformation Coalition was suspect, in my opinion, and
seems to have had the makings of a reformed empire in it. The Spinward Marches
were a marginally democratised Imperium.

And, of course, Milieu 0 was fascist through and through. GUPRSTrav is back to
the "good old days" of CTrav, but still has the "eternal empire" assumption ...
though may SJG will change that, who knows?

I take everything supposedly democratic about the RefCol and Spinward Marches of

It was the "addition" to canon mentioned by TWG that the Terrans were a corrupt
dictatorial mob as bad as the Vilani that triggered off my musings.

There is nothing in previously published material that I am aware of that really
makes this an inevitable conclusion.

It is the *trend* that I find distressing.

Look, as bad as the US was prior to the 1960\'s and Civil Rights, it was a
democracy. And, by and large, it managed to wage WW2 and then the cold war
without too many abuses of democratic power and democratic processes. And it
won. Ditto the UK and Commonwealth.

Why assume that the Confederation has to be that way?

We are told that the Imperials are fighting a limited war, and we have
reasonable evidence that terran tech was much better than Imperial. So it
reasonable to assume that the Terrans could easily manage to outproduce the
Vilani given the limited resources the latter chose to bring to bear.

It is not unreasonable, given productivity increases available in even the last
200 years, extrapolated into the future!

But democracy has *always* been there, somewhere, as either a reality or as a
desired ideal.

It is nowhere in the Imperium, beyond the borders of a few scattered planets.

And that, i think, is the key. It is a gift of modern technology ... and, at
least as much, of the level of education that modern technology has made
universal. I do not see how this can be taken away *partly* ... if you have
anything at all democratic in the Imperium, even individual worlds, you
inevitably have an example of something better than the Imperium and its
absolutist beliefs.

But in the countries I gave as examples they are (or have) succeeded. Or, at
worst, will almost certainly succed in the not too distant future. I would say
that even despots like Mahatir and Suharto found that out (or are in the process
of finding it out).

Which is, in turn, being moderated by the people chipping away at its absolutist
and anti-democratic principles. And it will continue to happen, slowly, but
inevitably. Just as it is in China. It is unstoppable,  it can be slowed, but
that\'s all.

>the next few years will likely only be transitional figure until the next

Maybe. But once the people have a taste for democracy, it won\'t go away. And,
being somewhat closer, I suspect that it may not be as you suggest. I suspect
that there will be a democratic government and that it will struggle along. I
don\'t see the army stepping in, not yet ... or even at all. I suspect that they
have blotted their own copybook obviously and embarrassingly enough that they
will keep a low profile for quite a number of years. All in all, something
*much* more democratic will certainly emerge.

>vanish if/when the government in Taipei decides to move closer to the

And I would suggest that this is somewhere about the same time hell freezes
over. The Taiwanese government is *Taiwanese* ... they don\'t see themselves as
being Chinese. The KMT old guard may not like it, and Beijing may not like it,
but it is likely that Taiwan will never be part of China again, unless they gain
what effectively amounts to full independence in some sort of economic union.

The current Beijing regime is not likely to last long enough to retake Taiwan in
any meaningful way, anyhow.

Yes. But you *can* change the individual politicians taking bribes! And there
are democratic freedoms and safeguards to some considerable degree ... no, its
not perfect, but it *is* (say) better than China.

No. I am really only suggesting that there, perhaps, should be a comment
*somewhere* to the effect that the Imperium is *not* the "good guy", and it
should be spelled out that the PCs might want to consider being part of the
"resistance" ... even if its only by evading Imperial Customs rules.

What I really wanted to do was to get people to realise *consciously* that the
Imperium *is* the "Evil Empire".

As for it being up to the Ref, yes, but the *background assumptions* are such
that he\'d have to run the PCs as some sort of rebels *or* be pretty non-canon.

There is no way the 3I can be called a confederacy. A loose federation,
perhaps, but not a confederacy - the 3I has the ultimate power, not its
member worlds (if they did the 3I wouldn\'t be nearly as large or as
powerful as it became).

As far as I can see in the OTU the nobility are a hell of a lot more
powerful than that, in general. Sure some knighted war hero on the lecture
circuit wouldn\'t have much power os influence, but how about all those
hereditary nobles? They own and rule land and have jobs in the imperial
beaucracy. These people have serious power - far more than any local
government that doesn\'t ahve some imperial titles of its own.

IMO this latter is even more likely to result in the disintergration seen
in MT than misguided noblesse oblige would be. Besides isn\'t this what the
decadence in the late 3I was shown to be?

Funny, I always felt that the Coalition was best summed up as "Aftermath!
in space". After all TW:2000 was about things getting worse - the slide
into chaos was still in progress. Both Aftermath! and TNE were about the
reconstruction, not the death throes of civilization.

Only if you consider all-out free enterprise and profiteering as

IMO this is a little too strong. Much of modern democractic ideals come
from Plato, though in a much more universal form.

I don\'t recall anyone actually talking about representative democracy in
particular, just democracy in general. Sometimes I\'m inclined towards the
view that representative democracy isn\'t actually democracy at all,
especially after watching a \'representative\' voting against the public\'s
will for thier own selfish reasons.

Athens didn\'t fail as a result of its Tyrants, nor did Rome succeed as a
result of hers. In fact a good case could be made for the reverse. Athens\'
Tyrants gave her a \'universal\' justice system, Rome\'s gave her what we call
the \'Roman Empire\'.

A Greek Tyrant was someone who ruled without any legitemate constitutional
authority - no matter how they got into power, unlike a Roman Dictator who
was elected by the Senate.

I beg to differ. From say 500AD to 800AD most inhabitants of Europe
wouldn\'t have been even a little bit interested in a Christian government,
except to kill its representatives. Even those who were nominally Christian
would have been happier if the governing authorities simply went away,
seeing as generally all they did (from the locals perspective) was to
gather taxes.

Where do you get that? In the Coalition there were a number of major
political debates in which no side was clearly right, so how would
questioning politics get you vented? At a wild guess you don\'t like TNE, do
you?

Yes, but it isn\'t impossible. And there is no suggestion that it was ever
considered. This is what I find unbelievable.

And a lot of their ideas were based on the classical tradition. These people
were *educated* in the classics. And even christianity owes a lot to classical
traditions. I think you are underestimating them.

I do not say they are the only sources. As you correctly point out, there are
other evidently independent original sources ... which only goes to support my
contention. It is so widely spread through our culture that it pops up all over
the place!

And, as for not knowing about classical graeco-roman realities, well, yes, I do.
I teach it for a living. The *tradition* had to develop somewhere, and a lot of
the ideals that we accept are based on them.

Nope, but its made plain that the Empire was founded on the bones of the Old
Republic. There\'s no reason why you can\'t have an elective monarchy, anyway.
Look at the Holy Roman Empire and its system (no, its not even close to a
perfect example, with nobles electing another noble, but the principle is
there).

Err, how is your historical knowledge?

*I* thought that Rob. S. Pierre and the planet of New Paris were dead giveaways!

I mean, am I the *only* person who was expecting the PRS "Witch of Endor" to be
captured by Honor in her escape from Hell?

I mean, it\'s obvious ... the PRH is *FRANCE* ... the Legislaturalists are the
Royalists and the CPS is, well, the CPS. 

Weber\'s re-writing the Hornblower novels (the ideas, not the exact events).

You\'ve got Haven = France; Manticore - United Kingdom; Silesia = Prussia;
Solarian League = America (a very much out of time America).

Has anyone figured out what Grayson is the equivalent of, historically speaking?
I haven\'t ... maybe there *isn\'t* a parallel?

Yep. The Third Estate is always has a problem ... read about how they lost
control of the real revolution to the mob.

The parallels aren\'t perfect, but they are fairly obvious!

And Rob. S. Pierre cannot do much better, as he acknowledges on several
occasions.

The Romans had elections for dictatorship, no matter how funny that might
sound today. They elected a ruler, an emperor, to rule until unable to do
so, or carely, until removed.

Why not play characthers that wants the power. I don\'t really see why the

But how do you hold elections in an Imperium which spans sectors. The canditates
put forth their program which then is shipped throughout the Imperium. This
takes years to reach the fringes. Now the people there has questions on what the 
candidate means with parts of his program, and how does this affect them? They
send questions back (more years pass), the candidate answers but under the years
there has been a recession so he has some new views that he has to send out.

When you get multisector covernments democarcies are not an option.

Well, maybe to *you* ... tell that to *all* the victims of the Fascist German
government during WW2. Or to the Stalinist Russian government from the 1930\'s to
the 1950\'s.

Ask them whether *they* agree that these goverments were theoretically equal to,
say, US Democracy of the same period. Or UK constitutional monarchy.

There are, inherently, some forms of government that are better than others.

The ones that allow and encourage arbitrariness are to be avoided (those that
are autocratic and absolutist) as there is no way of ameliorating the caprice of
the ruler. Those that allow and encourage democratic and/or republican ideals
are better, as they tend to ameliorate any arbitrariness (which is *not* to say
that they cannot be ruthless ... but they can recognise the fact that they have
been so or are being so because so many more opinions are involved).

>getting into empirical arguments about how things have worked out on earth,

Sure, and its even better if you\'re the Sultan.

Eventually his people will begin to wonder why, no matter how good their own
lifestyle is, *he* gets to live in a huge multi-hundred million dollar palace
and gets a jetset lifestyle and all they get is a middle class one.

That\'s when his days become numbered.

He will probably survive. Whether his son(s) do or not depends on their
adaptability ... they could do worse than look at the example of the House of
Windsor.

>Republic not so.  The UK is a constitutional monarchy without a

Well, yes and no. There are many laws that make it effectively a constitution.
One that is, perhaps, easier to change than the US (or Australian one).

The US ... indeed, *any* country where the government is elected by less than
50% of the people is not a democracy. In Oz we have compulsory voting - so, as
much as I dislike our PM and all he stands for, he can claim to have a mandate
from a hell of larger percentage of the people than Bill Clinton (or Newt
Gingrich) can.

Not in the Imperium. Its up to Strephon.

That\'s the problem.

                      The Terran Confederation

The Terran Confederation grew out of the old Earth bound United Nations. Due 
to the revenues generated by UNSCA, by the time of the First Interstellar War 
the UN was largely free of its former reliance on contributions from the individual 
nations of Earth for its budget. With the growth of a truly global economy 
coupled with the massive improvement in worldwide communications at the end 
of the 20th century the individual nation state lost much of its importance. 
However the various nations of Earth clung grimly to their sovereignty and 
nationalism was a major factor in Earth politics during the later 20th and early 
21st centuries; to the extent that several previously stable nation states were 
torn apart by regional nationalism. Indeed the two strongest trends in this era 
were the rise in nationalism and the tendency towards globalisation through the 
various power blocs that were slowly evolving. By the end of the 21st century 
most nations on Terra had grouped themselves into larger trading blocs (the 
European Union, the Asian Confederation, the Pacific Rim Alliance etc).

Thus the first war was not fought by a single unified Terran command, but by 
the forces of Earths various nations under the tenuous coordination of the 
United Nations. By the end of the First War it was clear that this situation 
could not continue. To have any chance of survival against even the Vilani 
provincial fleet, the Terrans would have to utilise their resources to the full and 
place all of their forces under a strong central command. Thus in 2120 AD the 
United Worlds (with the admission of the Terran colony on Alpha Centauri in 
2118 AD, the United Nations had been renamed) became the Terran 
Confederation. Naturally this aroused some strong opposition amongst the 
various nation states who still jealously guarded their sovereignty (especially 
true of the smaller nations). However a clever media campaign portrayed the 
First Interstellar War as a great triumph and stressed the need for cooperation 
in the face of the common enemy. Meanwhile the new Confederations more 
vocal opponents were quietly arrested and deported to the new rimward 
colonies. Those colonies did not oppose the formation of the Confederation and 
the subsequent loss of their autonomy due to fear of losing their protection from 
the Vilani Menace.

Initially the new Confederations powers were strictly limited to military matters, 
but gradually the Confederation evolved into a proper interstellar government. In 
2125 AD the various national militaries were incorporated into a single 
Confederation Army and Navy, in 2131 AD the Secretariat was given the power 
to directly legislate taxation, in 2140 AD the Secretariat was given the power to 
legislate on matters that affected more than one nation. The final change came 
in 2150 AD when the Security Council was abolished and the Secretary 
General was acknowledged as the executive leader of all the nations of the 
Terran Confederation. The Terran government remained largely unchanged 
throughout the Interstellar Wars (in 2179 AD a measure of local autonomy was 
restored to the individual colony worlds); the General Assembly was retained 
as a generalised debating forum in which all nations and worlds were 
represented equally, but legislative power over all worlds was retained by the 
Secretariat. Thus while the Confederation was theoretically a multiworld 
democracy, it was to remain dominated by Terran interests until it was 
dissolved by Admiral Estigarrbia in 2314 AD and replaced by the military 
dictatorship that was to become the Rule of Man.

Despite its ultimate demise, the Confederation drew on elements of all of 
Earths many diverse cultures in its make up. The western ideals regarding 
progress, innovation and individualism allowed it to equal and surpass several 
thousand years of Vilani technological achievement in just 200 years; whilst the 
eastern ideals regarding duty, family and community allowed it to single 
mindedly apply itself and thus defeat and eventually conquer the vast Ziru 
Sirka. Indeed this very cultural diversity was to play a vital role in the 
Confederations survival during the early wars. When the Terrans first contacted 
the Ziru Sirka the bewildering array of nations and cultures convinced the Vilani 
that they were facing a loose alliance of several minor Human races. Thus the 
Ziru Sirka believed that Earth was simply a forward staging post for a pocket 
Empire located further to rimward. Thus Earth came to be characterised in the 
mind of Vilani strategists as a nest of pirates from some unknown civilised 
region far towards the rim.

                           Terran Culture

Terran culture was profoundly changed by the initial contact with the Vilani and 
the subsequent Interstellar Wars. At the beginning of the Wars the dominant 
Terran culture was the liberal western culture that had developed in Western 
Europe and the United States of America. This culture emphasised the needs 
of the individual and encouraged innovation (and thus was almost diametrically 
opposed to the Vilani). Unlike virtually all other interstellar cultures of the 
period, the Terran culture actively embraced change and progress as a goal in 
and of itself; this was to prove to be one of the Terrans greatest assets, 
enabling them to catapult from TL 9 to TL 12 in just 200 years.

However under the pressure of the Interstellar Wars, the Terran culture was to 
undergo some major changes. As the Wars progressed, the pressures of the 
struggle inevitably lead to the Terran culture gradually becoming more austere, 
conservative and militaristic, increasingly drawing on its eastern heritage with 
its strong emphasis on duty and community; but it was never to totally lose its 
liberal and individualistic character. However along with these changes, the 
Terrans came to emphasis their cultural traditions that set them apart from the 
Vilani. Thus even though the Interstellar Wars forced the peoples of the Earth to 
finally see themselves as single people, they also saw a great emphasis on 
local cultural traditions. An example of this is that although English evolved to 
become the universal language of the Terrans (known as Anglic), the period 
also witnessed a great revival of many older ethnic tongues (including many 
supposedly dead languages such as Mayan, Cornish, Chinook, Motu etc). The 
other great change that occurred was the eventual death of many of the old 
prejudices that had plagued the Terrans for so long. When the Terrans came to 
see themselves as one people the many of the old social scourges such as 
racism and sexism dropped by the wayside.

This tolerant and liberal culture was to prove to be a great asset for the Terrans 
throughout the Interstellar Wars. For over 2000 years the Vilani had ruled over 
their subject races by a policy of assimilation and force. The Vilani were utterly 
ruthless in the conduct of warfare, relying on simple theories of cost efficiency. 
Any resistance or rebellion would be met with overwhelming force and no mercy 
would be shown (the Vilani did not take prisoners except in exceptional 
circumstances and had no hesitations in using genocide or weapons of mass 
destruction). Thus the Terrans with their highly structured concepts of humane 
warfare and their policy of tolerance for other races were welcomed as 
liberators by virtually all the Vilanis subject races. As the Terrans advanced 
they found many willing allies throughout the Ziru Sirka, many of whom would 
later be granted autonomy under the Rule of Man. Although this was not to be 
a major factor until the 8th and subsequent Wars, even in the early wars there 
were a few subject race units serving within the Terran military (the first such 
unit, the Vegan Legion, was formed in 2136 AD during the 2nd Interstellar War).

The period also saw a renaissance in Terran religion. Throughout the 20th and 
21st centuries the imminent demise of organised religion had been predicted by 
many Terran commentators. However these experts had not reckoned on the 
discovery of the Ziru Sirka; an event that forever changed the face of religion on 
Earth. The realisation that mankind was not alone in the universe strangely 
reinvigorated religious belief amongst the Terrans. By the end of the Wars the 
six great Terran religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Confucianism and New Age Mysticism) each had tens of billions of adherents 
including many non-Terrans and over 80% of the Confederations citizens were 
practising members of some organised religion.

                      Terran rimward Expansion

Whilst the Interstellar Wars apparently dominated the Terran Confederations 
policies, the period is also marked by a massive expansion into unexplored 
space by the Confederation. In reality, until the final Vilani collapse, this 
colonial expansion accounted for the majority of the Confederations growth. 
This expansion is usually referred to as the Terran rimward expansion, a 
name that is rather misleading as it also includes significant lateral colonisation 
to spinward and trailing. The key element of this colonisation was that it was 
directed towards areas not already controlled by the Ziru Sirka.

The rimward expansion resulted in much of the growth of the Confederation 
throughout this period. By 2160 AD, there were over 1,600 million Terrans living 
off Terra, by 2235 AD this had grown to more than 17,500 million (compared 
with the 17,200 million living on Terra itself and the 6,000 million absorbed 
Vilani in the former Ziru Sirka territories). By 2300 AD, these colonials made up 
over 75% of the Confederations Terran and absorbed Vilani population (roughly 
160 billion at that time). However, they remained chronically under represented 
in the Secretariat throughout the period; a situation that was to ultimately result 
in Estigarrbias coup and the downfall of the Confederation.

One of the more unusual facets of this expansion was the Terran 
Confederations policy of deliberately establishing settlements far beyond its 
conceivable sphere of influence. It is not know exactly how many of these 
colonies were established, since the entire project was shrouded in secrecy 
throughout the period, but hundreds of such colonies were established. Many of 
these settlements were established hundreds of parsecs away from the 
Confederation, well beyond its ability to administer or support and they 
consumed considerable resources for very little tangible return. These colonies 
were a form of long term insurance against the possibility of the Confederations 
defeat.

The agency responsible for these long range colonisation efforts was the 
Confederation Agency for the Preservation of Indigenous Cultures (CAPIC). Set 
up in 2124 AD in response to the fears of the smaller Terran nations regarding 
the loss of their cultural identities in the face of the expanding authority of the 
Confederation, CAPIC was charged with ensuring that the unique cultural 
heritage of Earth should be preserved regardless of the outcome of the Wars. 
Thus CAPIC embarked upon an ambitious program of long range colonisation. 
Many (though by no means all) of the colonists in the CAPIC program were 
drawn from Earths ethnic and linguistic minorities who already feared the loss 
of their identity in the rapidly evolving Confederation culture. It was a policy 
established by CAPICs first director (Dr Kenji Schwartz) that as many of 
Earths cultural and linguistic groups should be resettled; and that in an 
attempt to minimise any cultural contamination, each world was settled by 
only one cultural or linguistic group (Dr Schwartz lived in mortal terror of the 
loss or corruption of even one of Terras priceless linguistic treasures). In order 
to effect this policy, various methods were used to encourage groups to 
resettle. Most of these took the form of incentives (financial and otherwise), but 
CAPIC was not averse to using strong arm tactics if it proved necessary to 
encourage reluctant colonists to emigrate.

                    Terran Biomedical Technology

Throughout this period the one area of technology were the Terrans had a clear 
and unassailable advantage was in biological and medical technologies. Even 
at the time of the first contact the Terrans had a clear lead of several tech 
levels. The reasons for this advantage are not too hard to find. As the true 
homeworld of all Humaniti, Earth holds the greatest variety of life compatible 
with Humans. Thus the Terrans clearly fitted into the scheme of life on Earth; 
and there was a wealth of experimental subject matter that gave results 
relevant to Humans. However the most important factors was probably that, 
unlike the Vilani, the Terrans were exposed to vast numbers of hostile microbes 
every day and had to develop advanced biomedical technology simply to survive.

This advanced biomedical technology gave the Terrans a number of advantages 
over the Vilani. The Vilani never developed any technology equivalent to the 
Terrans cryogenic devices (low berths, food storage and the like). The Terrans 
had access to highly advanced drugs and medicines. The Terrans were able to 
genetically engineer Earth organisms to fulfil a great variety of roles, vastly 
increasing the viability and efficiency of their colonies. The Terrans were able to 
utilise terraforming to enable the colonisation of otherwise marginal worlds. 
Most Terran ships used a biologically based closed loop life support system, 
giving them far greater endurance than their Vilani counterparts. Terran 
computers used a synaptic architecture based on the human brain, greatly 
increasing their operational flexibility.

However the most well known product of this Terran biomedical technology was 
their biological warfare program. This is curious as the Terrans only employed 
these weapons once. During the 3rd War the Vilani employed nuclear weapons 
against Terran civilian targets on the colony world of Fenris. In retaliation the 
Terrans deployed a viral weapon against the Vilani world Shululsish. The virus 
proved to be more effective than the Terrans had envisioned; and within six 
weeks over 95% of Shululsishs population of 500 million had died either from 
the virus or the social collapse that accompanied it. This one solitary attack 
was to have far reaching consequences. The Vilani were terrified by this new 
weapon; its effectiveness and their lack of any defence or counter measures 
were quite clear. However, the attack also had consequences within the 
Confederation. There was a huge public outcry against the use of these 
weapons, it was only the pressures of the war that prevented the entire 
biological warfare program from being abandoned all together. However it was 
evident to the Confederation government that public opinion was very solidly 
against the use of these weapons and that there would be severe domestic 
consequences from any future deployment of biological weapons. As a result 
the Vilani and Terrans came to an informal understanding and neither side 
again deployed weapons of mass destruction against civilian targets.

Unfortunately the reluctance of the Terrans to employ their biological arsenal 
did not prevent the exposure of the Vilani to Terran diseases. It was inevitable 
that as the Terrans occupied a Vilani world, many of Earths hostile microbes 
would accompany them. As a result, the local Vilani population would be 
exposed to a plague of monumental proportions. It is a testimony to the 
Terrans dedication to their humanitarian roots (and their medical technologies) 
that, before the final collapse of the Ziru Sirka, on average only 5% to 10% of 
the local population died as a result of these plagues when the Terrans 
occupied a world. However with the final collapse, the Terrans occupied far 
more worlds than they could ever hope to deal with and the death toll from the 
plagues that swept through the former Ziru Sirka after the Interstellar Wars was 
far higher.

Unfortunatly there is very little in established \'canon\' to support the premise that 
the TC was a democracy one way or the other. My reading of AM6 gives a very 
different "spin" to the TC. It states that Estigarribia\'s coup had fleet support 
because the fleet was largely composed of colonials who were cronically under 
represented in the confederation government. It also states that the TC was 
dominated by Terran interests through out its history. The only other "evidence" 
is that the TC was based on the UN general assembly (hardly a democratic 
body). At its foundation the TC would have had to have incorporated many 
(quite probably a majority) of autocratic states who would be _very_ reluctant to 
see the introduction of democratic reforms in their own patch. The only way it 
could have really worked is for each nation to retain its internal autonomy (and 
political system) and select its representatives to the Confederation by 
whatever means it chose. Perhaps the large democracies might have elected 
representatives, but its just as likely that many nations/regions did not. I think 
its stretching things to assume that the TC was a democracy in the western 
European/US sense. I think it certainly was founded on the principles of 
western liberalism, but I don\'t think it would have been a true western 
democracy.

After 200 years of fighting for their lives, facing rationing, conscription, the 
constant threat of conquest/spies/etc; the TC evolved to become an 
authoritarian state, I do not think this is an unreasonable (nor unethical) 
assumption. I actually have a hard time believing anything else would have 
happened.

Similarly I\'ve never thought of the Vilani as "facist" either, they are Vilani. If I 
really had to put a label to them I\'d say they were closer to communist than 
facist.

I\'d say with electing planetary representitives on 7 year terms, and having
them elect sector representitives on seven year terms, you could cope with
2 years there and 2 years back fairly easily.

Then the only ugly questions are do you base the franchise on planetary
governments, or on individual citizens, or some half-assed mix of the two
(did anyone else see the system in the Regency Sourcebook and think \'with
half a gigacredit I could stack the shit out of that assembley\' ?).

You also have the issue of whether you dismantle the bedrock of the
Imperium, which is that it rules not the worlds, but the space between the
worlds. Once you admit voting rights, then other civil rights tend to raise
their ugly heads ... and then you get the problems of local and individual
rights vs the view of the elected representitives.

Still, the fact that they had the _option_ to vote is most significant.

It is a problem when more than half the electorate doesn\'t bother to
vote, but that doesn\'t mean we\'ve gone and changed government

for example in Brasil there is also compulsory voting....this means that

have to vote (if you don\'t vote you can\'t work) so they just mark down the
first one and go home.  do you get a \'none of the above\' option?  or a \'it

the freedom to *not* vote...how is that more \'democratic\'?

ever consider that your PM was elected due to random chance instead of
considered opinion?  was he first on the ballot?

sorry for the rant, but that is one of my hot buttons having seen
compulsory voting in action.

Personally, I think part of it is the fact that with communication limited
to the speed of travel, there\'s no practical method of running a democracy.
By the time the parties involve learn that there is going to _be_ a vote,
the matter that is being voted on has past.

It is worth noting, however, that both Dulinor and Strephon felt that the
Imperium was ignoring the little guy too much...Dulinor just didn\'t think
Strephon was moving fast enough (or so I recall).

As one currently living in the midst of it, I always assumed that Grayson
was the "Mormon Empire" writ large. Many of the cultural, social,
historical, and (to a lesser degree) religious aspects are certainly
similar, which is not a suprise, considering *where* the Graysons are
supposed to have migrated from in the first place - Idaho and the
surrounding western American states.

problems of space and time, it should be possible to have a *more
democratic* structure. The Zhodani Consulate, to one degree, is an
example: if they broadened the franchise so that anyone, rather than
just nobles, could vote for community council or hold office, it at least
would have grass roots democracy.... throughout the consualte.

Travel times should allow you to maintain democracy on a represenative
basis up to the subsector level and I think allow the election of a long
term sector governor if the terms were, say, 10 years. One can reduce the
demogogue factor by requiring a sector governor to have served as a
subsector governor first. He can be re-elected for a second term.

For multi-sector government, I would say abandon the strict democratic
model and instead have an Upper House on capital or the equivelent.
Each sector has 2 representatives on it who serves for life or until
retired or censored by the Upper House (requires 3/4 vote). If an Upper
House member dies or retires, the sector governor at home  advances into
his position, his vice president takes over, and he may appoint another
pro-tem vice president from among someone who was a subsector governor
etc. All officials, because of the possibility of moving up, would keep a
general idea on the next level of government. If a sector governor didn\'t
want the upper house job, it goes to his VP; failing that, the subsector
presidents get together and vote one of their number into the job.

I think that would work. The subsector government is small enough to be
responsive to an electorate with, say, 4 year terms. The sector government
with 10 year terms has enough time to get some things done between
elections at the speed of travel. The upper house is not democratic, but
the requirements for membership ensure that leaders familiar with and
probably sympathetic to their sectors will be appointed...

     Troy Hurtubise of North Bay, Ontario... took home an Ig in
safety engineering for developing and testing a suit of armor
impervious to grizzly bears. 
     The entrepreneur was attacked by a grizzly when he was 18
and has been working toward understanding the beasts ever since.
Despite his intense claustrophobia, Hurtubise has spent a dozen
years testing these suits-even getting rammed by a pickup truck
traveling at 50 mph to simulate the force of a grizzly attack. 
     At a post-Ig lecture at Harvard on Friday, Hurtubise
unveiled the next generation of grizzly suit, a model he calls
the G Man Genesis. The new suit, made of a new alloy stronger
but lighter than titanium, can withstand temperatures reaching
3,000 degrees Fahrenheit and can\'t be stopped by an AK-47.

[ObTrav: I have no idea why he won. Can you say "combat armor"?]


    Finally, this year\'s biology prize went to Peter Fong of
Gettysburg College, a man who fed Prozac to clams. The treatment
seems to make the mollusks happy-at least happy enough to

serotonin, a chemical event that induces spawning in clams.

office in Pennsylvania. "But it\'s not something I think I\'ll put

I would like to second this apology on behalf of BITS - I\'ve forwarded the
correction to Andy for changes in reprints. I don\'t know where this went
wrong, (probably in the transfering from Tim to me to Andy) but I feel bad
about this. Sorry Steve.

CSC and T4 discuss these relationships, albeit indirectly. There are tables
for computers at various ratings, at various TLs.

This is true. Due to the fact that now days ppl buy the setting and not the
system.
With the Now 3rd generation Systems like Gurps and heros and fudge. the
only reason. to buy a new game and not an add-on or supplement is that the
game adds something that is not caputured in the 3rd gen system. I play
WW\'s Vampire and WoD and not the Gurps version because of the flavor there.
I play Trav because I like the term based charater creation. I play Fang
Shui because it\'s my Idea of Hong Kong Action movies.

This change should continue with T5. Keep the gems that we all like and
make the system fast and free form. TNE damage and combat system with MT
task system and CT charater creation. shorter skill desciptions and tell
use about the Universe that is the Melieu T5.  Since this is a Traveller
release I sugguest all the Classic Major races be avilable for Cgen. and
the second product off the line being a Melieu book with all the stories of
the different melieus. I find that a kkewl way of selling Trav. And it
makes GT and assat as well. GT players will by a set and not feel ripped
off because they have more world information and may play in that system
due to look and feel reasons more then anything else.

Too true.

I\'ve written the text for 101 Vehicles, which I was hoping BITS would
publish. Is there a demand for this? (The vehicles are CSC designs.)



PS. Actually there\'s more than 101 vehicles. I\'ve already up past 150...

I am a brazilian so I feel I am more qualified to speak about this: it

You can give a blank vote or void your vote by voting on a candidate
that doesn\'t exist.

Not a problem.  I read the last couple pages, so I "knew" what was going to
happen, if only in gross dimensions.  After all, why would Weber off his
cash cow?  

ObTrav/GURPS:  I would _LOVE_ to see a sourcebook using the Traveller
system for Weber\'s universe.

It\'s available from my homepage:
http://members.aol.com/jimvassila  (just go to the programs section)

A more direct route is:
http://members.aol.com/jimvassila/progs.htm#galactic
(mentioned so that folks can establish a link to it from their own
homepages if they like the program enough)

Beware, it\'s about 6 megs. Be prepared to go get a snack and perhaps
mow the lawn after you begin downloading. Also, make sure you have
enough space on your harddrive before you start (you\'d be surprised
how many people forgot about this).

The server in Georgia which has been carrying the program has been
going up and down recently due to hacker-problems, but I think they\'ve
finally sorted all that out now. For those who have tried to use
Galactic from the TML cdrom distributed by Bryan, you need to copy
the program over to your harddisk and then unset the read-only flags.
The reason for this is that Galactic modifies some of its own files
in order to keep track of where you are in the program (what section
of space you\'re looking at). If those files are read-only, then it\'ll
have trouble doing this and likely bomb. I\'ve talked to Bryan about
this, and so far the easiest fix seems to be to distribute the
program as a single zipfile on the cdrom so that users will no longer
try to run it directly from the cd.

Also, for those interested in sector development, there\'s a galactic
mailing list in operation, though activity on it has been sporadic at
best. Inquire for more details... -Jim

A republic does not necessarily equal a democracy. Although I\'m sure that if you pinned
George Lucas down on it, he\'d establish the Republic (and the rebels) as a democracy,
since our willingness to identify with them is pretty key to the series. But I\'d say
Traveller has a background which is richer than this goodies-baddies thing.

You can give a blank vote or void your vote by voting on a candidate
that doesn\'t exist.
****************
at the tiem of that election, a blank or voided vote did not count as a
vote....IIRC blank or void got about 20-30% and actulaly scored higher than
one of the front runners...more people would rather se noone in office,
that him but he still made it to the second round....has this changed?

What I said was it runs like a confederacy. Government is highly devolved. But as

Some of them run their worlds, some (most) of them don\'t. At least IMTU. However
the fact that the noble "class" occupies most of the important jobs in the
bureaucracy, and probably a good few in the armed forces, is important.

It would if you thought the high moral standing of the nobility was key to the
stability of the 3rd Imperium in the first place. I don\'t think it was. I think
the key was the organisation and loyalty of the armed forces (granted, maybe due
to the position of the nobility), and the coincidence of interest between the
imperial government and the megacorporations. MT modifies this slightly and
starts giving greater weight to the archdukes. But the "playing pieces" in the
civil war are the fleets (and up to a point, the megacorps), not the nobility.

But ... at this point the nobility\'s position is based not upon a chivalric
ideal, but upon class (and presumably, money). So their "decadence" is
irrelevant. And the motivations I mention, while not particularly "nice", aren\'t
really decadent either.

I\'m not sure I can parse that sentence. My point is that M0 can\'t be described as
fascism. The aggression and greed of the Syleans (and of their rivals) may not be
particularly palatable, but that it how empires get built.

Not Plato, I think. Even if you\'re trying to argue that it\'s all handed down from
the Greeks. Plato\'s somewhere at the other extreme.

We were talking about the democratic tradition. Representative democracy is the
only real democratic tradition, in the sense of something that has been passed
down and tried on a large scale in a number of different places. Since the
classical era, Athenian style participatory democracy has been tried in medieval
Novgorod, Hungary and Poland, and, er, that\'s it.

My point was that Athens foundered as a result of her attempts to further develop
her empire, not as a result of her political organisation. And that, both
democratic Athens and republican Rome attempted with varying degrees of success
to impose their (undemocratic) rule on their neighbours.

Well I said it was a bet - in the absence of decent polling figures we can only
speculate. From about 800 to 1650 (say), though, Christianity and its internal
conflicts were the dominant forces underlying European political institutions.
But it\'s fair to say they weren\'t too worried about democracy.

There is (or was, not much now), but this doesn\'t mean it matters much.
Support from strong political figures and political marketing have much
more impact.

If a candidate has less then 50% of valid votes there\'s a second round
between him and the second place. This is catch: *valid* votes, so
blanks and voids don\'t count, and by voting blank or void you are in
fact helping the first place. (of course if you didn\'t go vote you\'d be
doing the same thing)

Well, I didn\'t say there weren\'t big media campaigns, heavy political
marketing, all kinds of dirty stuff going on, just that compulsory
voting has nothing to do with it. :-)

  One further explanation that helps is that the colonial troops weren\'t as
close to suffering morale collapse (as the French largely did in `17 and the
Germans finally in late 1918); some British units were apparently reaching
the end of their useful lifespan as effective (and certainly as offensive)
formations.

  Given the nature of the 3I\'s manpower pool (and most other large Trav states,
I suspect) this wouldn\'t be an issue except in civil wars.

  It is unclear to me in what way the Imperium is repressive - after all,
doesn\'t
it make few demands on its\' citizens beyond taxes and enforcement of what amount
to internal security laws?

  With relatively few modifications most of the above would be applied by some

  If the planetary administration is a well-behaved clone of 1960\'s British
democracy, then how can and why would the Imperium interfere with them so
long as they paid their taxes and enforced Imperial law?

  If the system is automatic then lost documentation will be very rare, and
the delays in the system should be built to allow for any statistically
relevant delays from the X-Boat network.

  Commitment of resources for the search would largely amount to simply
flagging it as a stop and seize target on your hotlist, unless you\'re
certain it was a hostile and dangerous intelligence ship or the like.
This is unlikely to be very expensive.

  The switching of ID\'s back and forth presupposes that no highly reliable
ID system exists for ships or their major componenets, and probably not for
crew either. This is a difficult assumption given that this thread pretty
much assumes that some sort of difficult to tamper with  transponder exists
and that G:T has formalized the existence of a rather too effective (IMHO)
universal Imperial ID.

  More to the point, any state that has the organizational technology does
tend to implement such measures - both Imperial and Republican Rome, France,
China, ancient Egypt, certainly the Inca and probably the Aztec states (and
the Spanish imperial establishment when it took over) - some of whom had
worse commo and command times and capabilities than the 3I.

  Early modern France had many of the same command problems as the 3I, and
certainly had much authority hived off to lower echelons of officials (many
of whom were effectively unremovable by any practical method).

  FWIW, communications in 18th century France were abysmal, and the
speed of many administrative processes was worse - the central state
accounts were always _years_ behind.

  In effect, the historical reality is that the tracking of as much info
as possible by the state (let alone the private sector) was pretty much a
constant, and an unsupported statement to the contrary would appear to be
wishful thinking.

That\'s why it was considered a computer virus, because the code

Heh.  If you do this (a) performance should drop rapidly with distance (like 
contragravity), (b) any changes in acceleration should be subject to a delay
equal to no less than the time required for light to travel from you to your
anchor mass and back again, and (c) power requirements become complex (equal to
no less than the dot product of force and velocity relative to anchor mass) and
_much_ higher than are listed for reactionless thrusters.  Make all those
changes and you no longer violate any conservation laws, though it still
violates physics as we know it.

Don\'t know specifics for rest of the US, but in Alaska, 30% turnout of the
electorate is maximum that can be expected. And, of those elligible to
register, only about 1/3rd do so and thus become members of the electorate.
So, rougly 1/9th of alaskans determine alaska\'s political nature.

This would seem to be a self selecting oligarchy. For what it\'s worth, I
have heard that much of the country is in similar voting straights....

This, upon reflection, I agree with. Back before T4 came along I used to
read MT\'s Imperial Encyclopedia and muse on what might have happened if
whatshisname hadn\'t successfully revolted against the Confederacy. I aways
felt that while the Confederacy was probably not very responsive to its
members wishes (it has always seemed to me that it\'s a fundamental part of
Traveller that once a state gets big enough that communications slow
centralised government becomes unwieldy, and IMO the Terrans didn\'t have
the time or experience to devise a workable decentralised system) it was at
least trying to be somewhat representative. Mind you IIRC MT does suggest
that the UN was less than interested in a truely democratic system, so
maybe the war was just a good excuse.

I found T4 irritating, because while the Syleans obviously played a bit
dirty at the begining, at least they had a vision. What\'s more the CT and
MT 3I (and to some extent the TNE one) wasn\'t evil in its early days, even
if by 1100 it had become moribund and rotten in the middle. In fact in can
be argued that the Rebellion wouldn\'t have gone on the way it did if the
lesser nobles and military weren\'t still reasonably uncorrupt and honest.
With no clear ruler these honourable nobles transfered their loyalty to
whichever contender seemed most worthy of the position. IMO if they had
more corrupt one faction or another would have been able to buy an
overwhelming advantage.

Sometimes when watching the US system in action (or reading about the 50\'s
and 60\'s) I\'d be inclined to call it either government by Bureaucracy or an
Oligarchy.

When Athens recovered some of her former status after the failure of both
the Spartans or the Thebans to control post-Peloppenesian War Greece she
was an open Oligarchy, not a democracy, and her citizens seemed more than
happy with this. Also when Athens was constructing her empire on of the
gifts she brought those who \'joined\' along with a permanent Athenian
presence was an Athenian style democracy. Curiously there were a number of
revolts, not all promoted by the former rulers, while after the war there
weren\'t many pro-democracy revolts in the newly non-democratic states.

But is it better? To many, especially those with a Vilani background,
democracy is either going to be uneeded, because they\'re well enough off
already (this applies if the democracy stays conservative and nothing
changes) or is an actively bad thing (if it becomes radical and changes
things, encourages technological growth, etc). Throughout most of human
existence societies and and people have been intensely conservative, and
the Vilani fit this mould. 

I guess that I don\'t have a problem with Traveller\'s lack of democracy, but
I do have a problem with all its government being painted as evil. 

Just because the 3I was doomed to fall didn\'t mean that it had to be evil
and exploitative right from the start. IMO it would be better if it was
once an example of how an empire can be run well and fairly (though the
3I\'s attitude towards member worlds would always limited this), but in its
final years became old and senile and finally destroyed itself.

This type of drive does require reaction mass, but the fuel efficiency is
~7.5x that of Heplar, so you only need 2/15s as much fuel.  As long as you

Shrug.  Total conversion thrusters (specific impulse 3e+7 Seconds, or about 50
ton-weeks per ton fuel) do a tolerable job of emulating CT fuel consumption
(assuming 5 tons mass per ton displacement, 10% of ship\'s volume per G-week),
and at least pay something resembling homage to physics.  Exactly what the
output amounts to might vary, but is likely intense enough to be dangerous at
short ranges anyway.

     There was a program put out by a company called Planet III Software,
that was a computer generated map of sectors.  The program was called
"Traveller Navigator" and they had put out four sectors before the collapse
of GDW and the subsequent loss of rights.  For a time the program was still
available as share ware through the Imperium Games web site.  I do not know
if you can still get it, but I loved it.  Not only did it contain the
information for all the systems in each subsector, but allowed you to
attach game notes to them as well.  The program also had allot of the rules
for space travel and movement times Etc. included as well.  They were
working on a program similar to those created by many of you called
"Starbase" which would have used the FF&S rules to design ships, and had
said it would also do some deck designs.  If you look hard you might find
it still on the web out there some where.

Might I suggest make it +1 if the skill is 1 less than the number of dice, +2 is 
the skill is more than 1 less than the number of dice. That way a character is 
just a little below the required skill level can compensate by acting cautiously 
(effectively lower skilled characters will take greater time) while those seriously 
underskilled will not be able to compensate.

Well, titling is actually Andy\'s call. And 201 Vehicles would require a
larger book (although I suppose it would save space if I left out such
minor details as prices and tech levels... :-)

What about 102 Vehicles? Hereby also neatly establishing a precident for
sequals to other 101 books.

More to the point, if you want to see it you could write to Andy Lilly
asking him for it.

Alternately, I suppose I could publish it as a PDF file (having finally
got Acrobat) with the printing turned off.

How about making "It\'s Harder Than I Thought" scale out on a one for one
basis?

A Formidible Task requires skill-3.  If Skill-1 tries it, it\'s two levels
harder.  Makes the "EMT attempts heart surgery" scenario so beloeved around
here more realistic.  If open heart surgery requires skill-5, and Eleven
the EMT has skill-1...

Grayson is a world in David Wber\'s _Honor Harrington_ series.  A world
settled by a religious group that wanted to be left alone, they had the
misfortune to pick a world with extreme heavy-metal levels.

Grayson society is very conservative, and at the time of their first

changes radically after meeting Cmdr. Honor Harrington, RMN.

The usual Traveller oligarchy is supposed to be a more exclusive

I think you\'re multiplying the same fraction against itself. "Electorate",
in American usual usage, includes all citizens above the minimum
voting age (with the exception, IIRC, of prisoners). The technical term
might be limited to only those who register, but I\'ll wager that both your
approx. 30% figures refer to the same statistic - how many Alaskans
participate in their government by voting.

There is a wide variance between presidential and non-presidential
election year turnouts, of course.

In the end, people tend to get the government they deserve.

  _Investment_ stimulates certain sections of the economy (typically the ones
in which said investment occurs). I doubt that anyone will seriously argue
that the German invasion did more for Russian production than the Stalinist
Five-Year Plans of the `30\'s (although efficiency likely improved in some
cases :> ).

  If investment level is going to be centrally directed (whether through
forced savings or taxation) it does not follow that destruction of assets
will accomplish more than the production of non-productive ones (let alone
accomplish more than uncontrolled investment in the civilian economy - at
least to hear modern capitalist theorists tell it).

  I keep running into the virtue of population control for warfare, but I\'ve
yet to hear a credible explanation (at least if it\'s your own population).

  I won\'t argue that the Imperium might not find warfare expedient :)

  Nothing that peacetime allocation of similar (lesser, in all likelihood) R&D
investment wouldn\'t achieve.

   Now that\'s a nightmare of an engineering problem, considering 
just how deep water is likely to be found and the temperatures and
pressures involved.  I\'d sooner try drilling to the Earth\'s core for iron.
   Were I the engineer, I\'d call it cheaper to set up on some
iceball with a low-tech fission reactor and start melting.  Even
set up an electric generator and start microwaving power to
someplace like your out-system sensor net.  You get better
thermodynamic efficiency at, say, 40 K than at 300, and no
environmentalists worrying about about heat pollution.
   Use the gas giant for its hydrogen content (shuttle tankers to
to the starport, especially if your mainworld is one of those
little desert rockballs where water\'s in short supply). Helium
and neon are valuable industrial gases, and a lot more common in
gas giants than on habitable worlds.

             Hydrogen, methane, ammonia, water.
   Typical of gas giants. The principal characteristic is a reducing
atmosphere, with plenty of free hydrogen. 

2) Middle hydrogen--Life bearers
        In order of decreasing volatility;
        Methane, ammonia, water, nitrogen, carbon dioxide.
   Heavier hydrocarbons and carbohydrates may also be present.   Neither
strongly reducing nor strongly oxidizing. Good support for many varieties
of biochemistry. Early earth was probably on the lower end of this scale.
Titan may qualify.

3) Hydrogen poor----common.
     nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide
        Water may be present, principally in frozen or liquid state.
Principal characteristic is an oxidizing atmosphere. In most cases, carbon
dioxide dominates, Nitrogen is next most likely. If water is present and
the planet is life bearing, free oxygen may be present.
If water is not present, sulfur dioxide or sulfuric acid may be minor
components.

   The basic composition and chemistry of this galaxy make it
biased in favor of carbon-based, water drinking, oxygen-breathing
organisms.  But for those who like the exotic, there is room
to add organisms which can tolerate or even depend on compounds
poisonous to humans: such as ammonia, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen
cyanide, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfur dioxides, and dozens of
fairly simple organic compounds, without losing too much
credibility.

That sounds potential a good way to go, but a question:

With skill-0, the "IHTIT" rule would apply to all tasks, wouldn\'t it?
So, even an 1D tasks become 2D, and a 2D tasks becomes 2.5D,etc.

[BTW: I think "Its Harder Than I Thought" as the name of a rule is
a bit unwieldy.  How about something like the "Skill Expertise",
"Expertise," or "Experience" Rule to reflect the idea that skill level
will be more valuable in more difficult tasks than high-stat+low
experience?  IHTIT is a good title for the description though.]

At first glance, it seems to me that above-average stats will be more
valuable than high skill levels.  So, I like the +2 levels of difficulty.
It looks like a little number crunching might be in order.

Make him sweat.  Literally.  Slippery fingers and salty sweat in the eyes
makes doing much of anything much more difficult.

Also, shaking in the extremities after burning adrenalin or lactic acid build up

in the muscles is a nice way to shake such players up.

Just curious...we get rid of the half die, there\'s no multiplying or
dividing, skills and stats effect the success of the throw in different
ways...



1.  Difficulties are target numbers, like in the old MT system.  For
example  (and I\'m just making up numbers here):

Easy  5+
Routine  15+
Difficult  25+
Staggering  35+
Impossible  45+



2.  Your stat modifies the target number by lowering it.  For example,
if you had a Dex 7, and you were throwing a Routine roll, you\'d have to
throw 8+  (that\'s 15 - 7).

Easy  Automatic
Routine  8+
Difficult  18+
Staggering  28+
Impossible  48+

notice how the difficulty categories are the same space apart (10 points
each), making it easy to see any target number for any category once
you\'ve done the subtraction once.



3.  The dice you throw are dependent on skill.  Everybody gets one die
by default--for task throws where they don\'t have a skill.  If you have
a skill, the chance of success improves greatly.  For example (taking
our example above one step further), our character has Dex 7 and
Pistol-2.

He would throw 3D6 (he gets his original default 1D plus 2D bonus for
his skill), and his target number would be those listed above.

Easy tasks are automatic
Routine task is 3D6 for 8+
Difficult task is 3D6 for 18+
Staggering task is 3D6 for 28+
Impossible task is 3D6 for 38+



Summary:  We would probably want to play with the numbers a bit.  I
think 18+ on 3D6 is a little harsh for a Difficult task for an average
joe with a level 2 skill.  But, I\'m talking concept here, not finished
product.

Comments?  Suggestions?

Then I think you want to go for +2 levels, but this might be a bit harsh on those 
only 1 level to low.

The purpose of the IHTIT rule is to counter the higher value of
characteristics when the level of skill is low.

    'body' => 'Here\'s my take on the whole Democracy vs Imperium discussion:


One of the big thematic elements in Traveller is responsibility.  Feudal 
systems are built around the oaths that bind each noble to both the 
nobles above them and also to all those who have sworn fealty to that 
particular noble (or those the noble is responsible for).

Similarly, Admirals of the Fleet, ship Captains, and so on, are all in 
positions of great responsibility.  Given the travel time, and 
communications lag, individuals need to have the authority to act 
quickly...and the responsibility to do so.

Now just because responsibility is a thematic element doesn\'t mean that 
everyone is immediately responsible.  In fact, the reverse often works 
better in game play.  Corrupt nobles, captain, admirals, are all very 
common ways to play something out.  And Survival Margin talked about the 
shift in the Imperium from Nobles who take responsibility and Nobles that 
just assume the privledges of their position.  (This of course is before 
the rewrite that made most M:0 nobles into amoral businessmen).

The "ideal" that I see in the Imperium is nobles and commonfolk each 
working to make the whole into a better place -- essentially, Dulinor was 
right.  The Imperium fails because it doesn\'t convince enough people to 
be responsible.  (And you could make a case for that in the real world as 
well -- we elect officials and assume that they will do all the work for 
us so that we don\'t have to volunteer our time and effort).

Yes.  Sorry I was unclear.

I figured that.  So I suggest make it +2 levels of difficulty,
unless number crunching gets results you don\'t like.

Some immodest proposals follow :-

1. Trade classifications, and non-mainworlds.
Detailed star systems may have other inhabited worlds
besides the main world, and these may fulfil the UPP
criteria for a trade type e.g. mainworld is an asteroid belt,
and there\'s an "agricultural world" present too.

An overall resources score needs to be determined for the system,
as per Pocket Empires.
Each \'significant other\' world adds one to the resources score.

IMTU I determine resources as Jim Vassilakos suggested a while ago,
and use 2D-7 + mainworld size (+ gas giants, planetoid belts, and
interesting other worlds if commercial spaceflight exists).

Score   Comments
0-      Barren. Barely adequate to sustain population.
1-4     Poor. Surplus resources not worth trading.
5-B     Average. Economically exportable wealth.
C-E     Wealthy. System important at subsector trade level.
F+      Rich. System important in sector-wide trade.

I\'ve also tweaked the trade classification system :-
Agricultural : resources 5+, life-bearing (IMTU 6+)
Barren : resources 0. Not necessarily unoccupied (but who would
want to live there if they could avoid it?)
Poor : resources 1-4. Atmosphere and hydro requirements dropped.
Rich : resouces F+ (PE maximum 22, IMTU 30)
Industrial : needs pop 9+, therefore Hi-Pop classification.
Non-Industrial : discarded.

2. Starship crews and their pay.
In MT Imperial Encyclopaedia, pay depends on position, skill,
and discharge rank from chargen.
In table below :-
Minimum rank = skill = 1 ; max rank = skill = 6
Average rank 2 ; average skill 2.5

Stewards, Troops 500        1000       3000
* - ship\'s boat, not starship pilots

One could give \'brevet\' ranks to crew to increase their pay, or
change their pay scale. Good crew get paid like command crew, say.

6000Cr per month is a very good income when the average worker
makes 10-12KCr a year. Profit sharing arrangements are yet another
possibility. (individual contracts? product endorsements for the
real heroes??)

(PE : 100 million people earn one trillion credits on average ; plus
extrapolating from cost of living figures in LBB\'s).

3. Freight Costs and Passenger Fares
The speculative trade rules in the LBB\'s mentioned that the cost
of freight was a percentage of the cargo value. I can\'t remember
off the top of my head what it was (5-10%??) - but I think 1000Cr
per displacement ton ends up being a poor deal if you\'re
carrying anything more complicated than grain or ore.

So all freight is charged at a percentage of a cargo\'s value.
Cargoes need to be specified. Perhaps some tables would help <g>.

Hans Rancke-Madsen\'s shipping tables show that carrying passengers
isn\'t viable after a few parsecs :-
           Cost of Shipping, Cr
Parsecs    Low       Middle     High
1          799       3769       4335
2          1080      4774       5850
3          1524      6641       7922
4          2018      8338       10496
5          3119      15913      12409
6          4677      17833      23000
[Ticket :   1000      8000       10000]
- - and this ignores the \'life support\' charge for the crew, as well!
Is the life support fee an amalgam of insurance premium, departure
tax, consumable fees and a \'right of way\' fee levied by the 3I
(protection money, given recent talk about the \'evil empire\')?.

Moral of the story :- leave passenger haulage to the corps, who enjoy
economies of scale the small fry do not.
Has anyone built a set of corporate rules? I recall a Universal
Corp Profile on the Traveller webring....

[What individual, or small group thereof, is going to have a high
jump capable ship and even care about shipping passengers for
profit, anyway? The ship is either stolen, loaned (for a specific
mission) or owned ("Daddy\'s yacht").]

4. \'Primitive\' Worlds and Trade
Chronic debt is a problem unless imports of expensive gear are limited
(ideally, to capital goods - development is the only way out). Look at
most of the Third World.
Itinerant con-men (sorry, traders) flogging beads to the natives
should be discouraged, perhaps with armed force.
(Imperial contraband patrols - space based or portside customs
agents...)

5. Financial intermediaries
Yes, there should be brokers, bankers and the whole panoply of
financial services.

Watch out for those TL 15 derivatives though ; you need some
serious computing power just to figure out what you\'re buying,
exactly. Or is it leasing ? I\'ll let the expert system process the
contract....

Interest rates in the Imperium?
Low, because the place has been stable for 1000 years.
Middling high, to finance all those "4000Cr per year after 20 years
service" pensions.

Prime rates : not more than 3-5%
Upper ceiling on legitimate rates of return : 15% on shares with 100%
dividend reinvestment??

Individual worlds may vary significantly from this depending on
their financial health....

I\'m sorry if I\'m exhuming old corpses.

One of the problems people (like me) have had is the Talented
Beginner (High Stat - Low Skill) being as good or better than the
Experienced Veteran (Average Stat - High Skill).  This might help...

Ted
  DEX         11
  Demolitions  1   (12)

Andy
  DEX          7
  Demolitions  3   (10)

Normally, Ted is going to have an advantage over Andy at any task
level, but now let\'s see what happens with Marc\'s idea, modified by
Doug\'s suggestion:

 Easy         +1
 Average      +2
 Difficult    +2
 Formidable   +3
 Staggering   +4
 Hopeless     +5

Ted and Andy attempt an Easy Task:
   Ted (12)  on 1d6  100%
   Andy (10) on 1d6  100%

Ted and Andy attempt an Average Task
   Ted (12)  on 2.5d6 91%  <---- Not much difference here
   Andy (10) on 2d6   92%

Ted and Andy attempt a Difficult Task
   Ted (12)  on 3d6   74%
   Andy (10) on 2.5d6 71%    <---- A little problem

Ted and Andy attempt a Formidable Task
   Ted (12)  on 4d6   34%
   Andy (10) on 3d6   50%  

Ted and Andy attempt a Staggering Task
   Ted (12)  on 5d6   10%
   Andy (10) on 4d6   16%
  
This looks good to me, except for the 1/2 die on Difficult Tasks.
I\'m biased, I\'ll admit, but I think you might be able to drop the
1/2 die if you use this rule.

This kind of thing is "my thing" too. ;->

I\'ve seen better ideas from you on this idea, Ken. Your (Stat +
Skill*D6) idea is better. 

For non-d6 people, how about a modification of the TNE system where
you don\'t divide or multiply the asset, instead you have flat +/- 4
for each level around Difficult?  The uniform distribution of a d20
means each Task level is 20% harder/easier than the ones around it.

Easy        Asset + 8
Routine     Asset + 4
Difficult   Asset
Formidable  Asset - 4
Impossible  Asset - 8

For me that\'s easier to remember and use.

BTW, for the d6 crowd you can do the same thing with +/- 3 on a 3d6
rolls with good results. Try the numbers.

The impression I got from the books is, the state religion, the Church of Man Unchained, was more of a \'holy roller\'-style Pentacostal movement.  Mormons aren\'t Pentacostals.  I can almost see Austin himself chitchatting with Oral Roberts and Billy Graham and holding his own.

FWIW, I see a bit of a parallel with Grayson as Japan before Perry.  You have various and sundry \'warlords\' (Steadholders) keeping on top of an almost figurehead Emperor (Protector).  In their steadings, the Steadholder gets an almost *fanatical* devotion from his subjects and of course his own personal army.

Well since a cautious task takes twice as long according to the rules

I\'m passing that along to my Med School friends.

At law school, the good joke we learned for doctors who hate lawyers is
just to say:

Over two hundred years ago your professional ancestors were bleeding people

with leeches, while my professional ancestors were writing the United
States
Constitution.

I usally add that the Constitution, great as it is, might have been better
if
those \'doctors\' hadn\'t been bleeding some of the founding fathers to death.

George Washington had 4 doctors all doing independent bleedings of him

Well, like I said (in another post), all an Interstellar Government *really* has
to do is to protect trade and enable the safe carriage of the mail. It can leave
pretty much everything else to the individual worlds.

It would actually be pretty easy to run a government on that basis. It would,
effectively, be a real Confederacy. The central government would not have a
reason to intervene in the affairs of individual worlds unless ...

a) Said world tries to prevent or limit (beyond specifically allowed
limitations) access to offworld travellers and traders (and vice versa,
perhaps).

b) Said world tries to interfere militarily in the affairs of another world.

These would have to be pretty loose ... and, yes, you would end up with
Kossovo-like situations where the Confederacy sits on its backsides forever
before actually doing anything ... but, when they act, they would be like a
sledgehammer squashing a wet, soggy, pea.

Since there is not a great deal for the government to do that needs doing
*quickly* that could not have been set up by the original, much smaller,
forerunner organisation, there is really no problem with slowness of
communications. No more than the Imperium has to deal with.

Would it work? Probably about as well as the Imperium does, and with much
greater freedom of choice.

>When you get multisector covernments democarcies are not an option.

No. That is an anti-democratic *assumption*. They will require different ways of
looking at things.

Of course, a lot of people accepted "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fuhrer", too ...
and rejected the Weimar Republic (though they didn\'t understand that that was
what they were doing at the time).

There is no reason why a reasonably intelligent bunch of sentients could not
come up with a democratic *style* government for an Interstellar Nation.

Maybe in Brazil they are stupid?

In Australia, first choice on the Ballot Paper is drawn randomly by the AEC, so
there is no way of taking advantage of it.

Innumerable (well, a large number, anyway) of studies have shown that "Donkey
Votes" rarely make the difference between victory and defeat and are a tiny
percentage of the overall ballots cast.

Remember, in Oz we actually fill in paper ballots by hand rather than using
voting machines as much of SoAm does and, as I understand it, the US does.

Anyway, the perfect solution, I\'ve always said, is to print circular ballot
papers with the candidates name around the edges. Try getting an advantage from
that!

>ever consider that your PM was elected due to random chance instead of

Nope. PMs are elected by Parliament ... the majority Party therein. They are not
directly elected by the people (hey! wait a minute, neither is *your* President
... he\'s elected by the Electoral College which can, and has at least once,
voted against the expressed will of the people ... that travesty of democracy
*cannot* happen in Oz!!!). We have a Westminster system, thank you very much,
and find it works very nicely most of the time. At least as often as yours does,
if not more so!

Like I said, maybe in Brazil they\'re all stupid. I can assure that they aren\'t
in Oz!

Personally I think that multiplying/dividing by two, as in TNE, is a
wonderful idea. I don\'t like systems where a task can become impossible for
a low skill character while remaining pretty easy for the highly skilled
(MT\'s task system does this sometimes).

Or if you want to replicate the effect of TNE use +-2 for each TNE
difficulty level.

It was well hidden at the time, and is still hidden to a considerable extent,
but the British Army was (or significant portions of it) were either actually
mutinying or were close to it by October 1918.

May I suggest making the user roll as many extra dice as you are missing
skill levels ?

Example : Joe Brainburner has Explosives-1 and INT-13, and is trying a
Formidiable (3d) task. Because he\'s 2 skill levels down, he would be
rolling against 5 dice against 14. Lotsa luck, Joe ... experience counts -
his friend, Edith Expert, has Explosives 4 and INT 8. She is rolling 3 dice
against 12.

It is likely that the development of new treatments will eventually
outstrip the natural evolution of new pathogens.

This is only within the context of our world, however, and it may be that
with a thousand worlds for bugs to evolve on, new plagues may appear at
times that prove resistant or adaptable to the accepted methods of
treatment.  Among the \'spacer\' community (that is, starship crews, regular
interstellar passengers, and starport staff) such things may be alarmingly
prevalent.

Disease usually makes a poor environment for roleplaying, however.  I, as a
GM, would use it more as a prod for moving people than to actually have
them catch a disease...

In the case of long distance trade, yes. But transport costs for high jumps
are going to be higher than for low jumps even with drop tanks.

That would make nonsens of the TNS newsbriefs which speaks of established
commercial services which use drop tanks. My suggestion is that the period
is one of transition to drop tank transport. It takes time to replace the
existing body of merchant ships; furthermore, drop tank traffic lacks
flexibility and requires a certain minimum of trade. Thus drop tank services
are still few and only between systems with a lot of traffic.

Phil, I am always happy to respond to a philosophical post, and will delurk
momentarily to address some of the ideeas that you have bought forward.

>Does anyone else on the list find that the political philosophy as

I do.... There is no denying that the basic structure of the Imperium is
anti-democratic. Therefore, it would seem to us, being people who
acknowledge, and greatly appreciate, the currency of democracy, that this
particular structure is wrong and abhorrent. I would hope that there is
no-one on this list who would like to even like attempt to implement this
sort of structure in real life. Were this so I would certainly be one of
the Ine Givar. 
However, I feel that the Imperium, like any government, has it\'s good
points and it\'s bad points. I like to think of the Imperium in a more
chivalric manner, where the nobles have a duty to those not only above but
below. LIke any government, this allows the Imperium to both shine brightly
like a beacon in the dark (as a Duke leads naval personell, who bravely
sacrifice their lives attempting to run badly needed food and medical
supplies to a neutral world blockaded by a hostile power), and to be
responsible for the most heinous acts (as a Count trades the live of
several thousand colonists on a newly settled world for a chance at
stepping one more rung up the social ladder).
The environment provides for many adventuring possiblities (like the
attempt by a party to bring the count to trial).
It is an unfortunate, but true fact, that the type of government structure
possessed by the Imperium is likely to be abused by those in power than
more often than not.
>
>Worst of all, the underlying assumption of everything that has been

Unfortunately, this is true, the fact that the imperium lasted 1000 years
before it was torn apart by civil war is quite remarkable. The government
was an empire, the only method of advancement was over the corpse of
another (be It a loved relative dying of old age, or a political rival with
a knife in the back). 
This method of advancment was even acknowledged as law (the right to become
the emperor by assassination). That alone should have pointed to the
inherent illnes of the Imperial structure. (the right of assination was
established in Ctrav).

>MTrav and the TNE sequel to it was about how decadent all the power groups
>within the imperium were, at their base. All of them. Even Norris.

Mtrav, yes (oh.... but what an interesting environment to adventure in),
TNE was not so. The Reformation Coalition was a democratic government which
abhored the the structure of the Imperium and rightly blamed it for the
destruction it wrought. 
The regency was also in the process of replacing the nobility with elected
officials.

The path from open democracy to repressive regime is not as long as people
believe. Even today, people in my country are re-electing officials who
place camera\'s in the streets. We are beginning to accept the routine
invasion of our privacy, becuase of the security that it brings. "The
government is looking after me, and doing it\'s best to protect me from bad
people". In countries around the world towns are beginning to hire private
police forces to protect them, by making sure no undesirables live where
they do....

Democracy is as fragile as the people who make it up..... but it is
interesting that you use Greece and Rome as an example. Both limited which
citizens could partake of their democracy, and both allowed the enslavement
of other people. 
Is it really so different today. In Australia, if you refuse to give
evidence to a Royal Commission you can be detained.... without trial... it
has already happened once.

And may they achieve their objective.... for democracy is much better than
any of the alternatives.

And in Australia, the people of the Northern territory voted to give other
people the right to kill them, by voting for euthenasia. A democracy is as
strong as the will of it\'s people.

In times of military emergency, democracies have been known to put some
aspects of their democracies on hold.... the UK formed a governemtn from
both sides for the duration of the war. It is not too hard to fosee
democratic institutions being placed on hold, for the desperate emergency
that must have been the Interstellar wars. These wars went for a long
time.... it is conceivable that the democratic tradition may have been lost.

>Admiral Estigaribbia stages his coup to supposedly protect the Vilani from
>Terran exploitation, but declares himself emperor rather than, say,
President.


The Vilani had an emporer, it is something they would understand. It would
also provide him with great personal power. For him to do this must have
meant he was seeking this power. We have to ask... what kind of man was
he... how did he deal with his opposition. 

IMO The anti democratic theme adds flavour to the game, I will not lament
the passing of the demcratic ideal.... it hasn\'t. Those who play in my
games experince first hand the problems of living in a non-democratic
society. 
Plus they also have a lot of fun! (Or so they tell me, I think that\'s what
htey mean when they call me a ba____d at the end of the night, at least
thier smiling when they do it... and they always come back for more)


As a last point... true democracy is as impossible to acheive as true
communism, anarchy or any other idealic structure. There will always be
groups that will have thier rights removed by the will of the people. The
Rich who will dominate government to thier own ends... That does not meen
that democracy is bad... just not perfect.. but then what is?
How about adventures in an evil democracy (look at the Federation in Blakes
Seven).

if those \'doctors\' hadn\'t been bleeding some of the founding fathers to
death.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Most of the founding fathers were businessmen, inventors, philosophers,
farmers, military leaders - as well as, if they were at all, lawyers.

How many lawyers today are anything but lawyers?

And I seem to recall leeches, for certain medical applications, coming
back into fashion...<g>

Cryptoquote of the day: "The problem with the United States is not
that we have so many lawyers, but that we have so many good ones.
Think of all the dedicated, competent men and women who could be
curing diseases, inventing new products, creating new wealth, who
are instead greasing wheels on deals and cutting people down to make
business for each other."

The upside is that because we have been working so hard to build lamposts
and rope there will be plenty to spare.... 

Is the idea of national governemtn declining..... is it being rplaced by
the international corporation. 
I work for a large company. It is run by the manager. If the manager does a
good job... he will run (rule)  the company for a long time. He appoints
sub-managers becuse he can\'t be everywhere at once. This company routinely
monitors my workplace and reads my emails in the interst of making sure
that the company is secure, that I am not abusing my priviledges and am
working hard. 
If you don;t like the sytem you can resign (emigrate). If you don\'t tow the
line you are sacked, or fired (executed).

Replace manager with duke, sub manager with barons... and you see that many
of us still live (for 7-8 hours a day) within a feudal system. These larger
companies can and do influence governments. Some governments wish to
emulate the success of large companies (economic rationalism). 

Is this how the terran government was slowly replaced with a feudal system?

Subject: GT: SIM-12 Missiles

     In the midst of designing a starship, I was just looking over the
SIM-12 missile on p. 159 of GURPS Traveller.
     The warhead is a 62.5 lb 250mm directed-energy (HEAT) type.
While good for punching through armor, there might be an alternative
warhead available of the HE annular blast fragmentation type, proximity
fuzed.
************
Yeah, that works...
     For example, this missile  can carry a nuclear warhead ranging
from a mini-nuke of only a few tons yield, to a strategic nuke of up to
2.48 MT yield (
*****************
Dont let the Navy find out you have it.


     An even more interesting possibility for Navy SIM-2s would be the
bomb-pumped X-ray laser!  (I got to like these things back during the SDI
debates, and became a real fan of them after reading the Honor Harrington
series...) :)  MA Lloyd covers them on p. 110a of his VE2 additions.
**************
if you do use then, use the ones from Pyramis...not a all powerful...also
might want to playtest them to make sure they don\'t invalidate Imperial
naval designs.


     I was surprised to see the SIM-12 employed straight command
guidance via a one-way laser link, with no sensors aboard the missile
itself!  While this would definitely keep the cost down, I would suggest
that Naval versions (if possible) be given Brilliant PEH, Brilliant NH,
Active LADAR Homing, or some combination,
*************
yes there is 0.8 cf of empty space in them.


     Another possibility is to use a two-way datalink, and mount some
sensors on the missile itself.
*********
also a good idea.


     The "stock" SIM-12 is set up to boost at a constant 10G for one
hour.
*********
rather you have 30 hexes of velocity change....the missile still works
until it is out of power.  You fly it using pilot (Missile).


     Finally, are the SIM-12s also the missiles that would be used in
the bay missile racks?

Yes.

I\'m playing a captain with Service-6, Liason-3, Persuasion-3 and Legal-4.
Virtually no starship operating skills or combat skills.  So when I see all

The pirates-are-not-economically-viable crowd, of which I am a member,
believe that pure piracy is not, well, you guessed it, economically
viable. Now, you can come up with lots of examples from the Real World of
activities that are not economically viable and are still attempted by a
lot of people (prospecting for gold in the Old West is a good example).
But I can\'t come up with a single such activity that requires a multi-
million dollar investment.

If we are wrong and pirates can expect a reasonable average profit, then
IMO pirates would certain exist. Even if most pirates crap out, if the
odds of a big return is sufficiently high, I think you could propably find
investors to support pirate activity.

But if we are right, then someone must be footing the bill and they must
be after something other than money as a return. That\'s where we get to
the subsidized raiders. But whoever is subsidizing them must be getting
something in return that is worth millions of credits. It\'s not enough to
say: "Well, pirates are possible if someone subsidized them. You must also
come up with a plausible reason for them to plunk down the money. 
 
>Well they could grab a big merchant or two and have all that much more to

If you go to a system with no defenses you can catch anything that turns
up with empty tanks, yes. How many ships will arrive in a couple of weeks
such a world? How much is a random cargo worth? Can you take the ship with
you and how much is the ship worth to a \'ship fence\'? The two lines above
contains a huge number of assumptions, very few of which are agreed upon by
everybody in the discussion.

>How many loads of say a 4000 ton freighter filled with computer chips would
>it take?  ONE!

How many 4000 T ships visit worlds with no system defense boats at all? Very
few, IMO. How many of them would be carrying a high-value load? Even fewer.

>Part of being a sucessfull pirate is intel on the goods. Spies in ships

OK. Let\'s say you have a spy in Akerut\'s shipping department on Aramanx and
are waiting for a good tip. Where are your ship in the meantime? What does it
do? You then get the tip that Akerut is gount to send a particularily valuable
shipment to Towers in six days. How do you capture that particular ship?

In Australia, first choice on the Ballot Paper is drawn randomly by the

there is no way of taking advantage of it.

IMTU I\'ve always assumed that any cargoes that needed special storage had such
included in the cargo volume. 3 tons of frozen pizza is in fact only 2.5 tons of
pizza and 0.5 tons of refrigerated storage.

Assuming special storage is not included in the cargo volume then cargo holds
would have to be pretty expensive items in order to cater for all the potential
cargoes.

On the subject of cargo, I\'m sure that the subject of containers has been done
before on the list. What was the outcome?

Odd decision. The Azhanti class were the ship that convinced me that bays

Not necessarily. IMO, 3I citizens are pretty much like the
average citizen now. They basically want to be left alone
to live out their lives and don\'t have much real interest in
what happens outside of their personal environment, unless
they recognize an event as a threat to their personal
environment. If something is a threat, most will take the
easiest way which seems to neutralize that threat. If that
means aligning with one faction over another, that\'s what
they\'ll do. I don\'t see it so much as "honourable". I believe
it to be more a matter of personal survival.

Yep, that\'s pretty much how I see (and run) it. With the
exception that the 3I is pretty much a hands-off organization
in regards to individual world governments. Most govt. corruption
which affects PCs in my campaigns are world govts. An appearance
by the Imperium in a situation usually signifies the PCs are
*really* in it deep, especially if a corrupt Imperial official
is involved. The flip side of this is that if the official is
caught, he/she/it pretty much winds up as healthy as road kill,
not so much out of honor (though it has happened in the past)
but because the naughty noble let other nobles discover he/she/it
had an advantage over them; i.e., a perceived threat to their
personal environment.

Hmmm..The Naughty Noble..sounds like an Imperial bachelor party
holo. :P

It may not matter to you, since your campaign takes place in TNE, but it
makes a huge difference to those of us who set our adventures in an era
where these supposedly unforgable transponders are in use.

Yes of course. The owner of that false transponder had better have a
genuine one to show to anyone that inspects the ship. I never disputed
that.

Obviously. That\'s not the issue. But it can hardly be through legitimate

do demonstrably exist.

And just how do you propose that someone with an unaltered transponder will

Well, sometimes there are no way to reconcile an incongruity and in those

There you go jumping to conclusions again. I haven\'t mentioned my proposed
solution to the problem at all. I\'ve been too busy getting you to admit that
there is a problem in the first place. Now that you have, perhaps we can move
on to a more constructive discussion.

Now, moving the date of introduction of the Deyo transponders a decade
may work (although it will leave several issues that _some_ of us consider
highly unlikely). But here another factor enters. If we have to change
something anyway, I\'d like to leave as much freedom for the individual Refs
as possible, within an established framework. With this solution Refs will
have to use the unforgable transponder in MT and G:T settings. If we make
transponders difficult, but possible, to forge, then Refs who want to
can tell their players: "But you can\'t do it and you don\'t know how to
find anyone who can", effectively allowing him to use unforgable
transponders and still stay within canon. The reverse is not true. If the
canonical transponder is unforgable, any Referee who wants to give his
Bad Guys a false transponder is forced outside canon.

So here is my proposal. FWIW it addresses all the problems I had with the
original version and still allows the Virus to run rampant through Deyo-
type chips from the Rim to the Core.

- ----
The Deyo chip project was concieved and sold to the Emperor as a way to create
an unforgable transponder. In 1086 the researchers thought they had reached
their goal with the developement of the SDG-313F chip. It was made mandatory
for Imperial ships in 1088 and over the course of 12 years retrofitted into
all existing vessels. But long before that human ingenuity had managed to
circumvent the supposedly unforgable transponder. For the most part genuine
transponders were stolen and programmed with false information (the military
version of the transponder, specifically designed to be able to put out false
IDs, was especially popular, but also, of course, much harder to come by) but
other methods were also used. The most resourceful rival interstellar states
even managed to duplicate the chips and create their own versions. The
rarest, but also most efficient, method was for a psi adept with computer
empathy to "seduce" the chip into broadcasting false information even though
the chip "knew" it was false. Fortunately computer empathy is an extremely
rare talent.

Despite all this, the Imperium stuck to the Deyo transponder. The reason was
simple: Even though the transponder was not completely safe, it was vastly
safer than the one it replaced (For this reason the technology was also
adapted and used by other interstellar states). The fact that admitting the
truth would cause an enormous loss of face to some very powerful Navy people
may also have played a part; certainly the Imperial authorities never
admitted officially that their transponders were not 100% safe.

Unofficially the number of transgressions mounted as powerful corporations
decided that they did not want their commercial rivals to know everything
they did and began using "alternate" transponders in steadily increasing
numbers. By 1107 the practice was so widespread that while private
individuals would still get into very serious trouble if caught using them,
interstellar companies could use them with relative impunity as long as they
were discrete about it and didn\'t break too many other laws in the process.

But individual planets are not bound by that restriction. If that was the

I\'ve only seen bits of such discussion, but IMTU I\'d assumed that
people hiring cargo space at Cr1000/tn would expect the kind of

containers that can handle exposure to space - say, to allow
cheaper cargo transfer to an orbital ship - the person who owned
the cargo would make that decision. The person owning the cargo
would have to, of course, meet some Imperial shipping safety
requirement, especially with regard to hazardous cargos.

In the case of speculative cargo, it depended where we were. On high
tech, high traffic worlds the players were often assumed to be bidding
on leftovers from what came in on, or was supposed to go out on the
big corporate ships - most of these cargos would already be well
packaged for long hauling. On lower-tech worlds, the PC\'s might
be responsible for packing the cargo themselves, including safety
procedures. This could make for interesting hazards - "What, you didn\'t
know that ripening Zhorgo fruit made that smell? I wouldn\'t worry
about it - but you probably shouldn\'t smoke that in here..."

Interesting idea for a confusing cargo. Players get hired to ship
a bunch of shipping containers to a frontier world...say a research
project needs something safe to pack up all the doodads from an
archaeological site in. Smart player realizes they can get paid
twice for the same trip - put a cargo in the shipping containers
before they go. Then get bitched at by the scientists for getting their
nice, new shipping containers all dirty, contaminating the samples...

Fair enough, it\'s not the easiest the thing in the world and I\'d be
delighted if BITS books were already available over there.  After all, if
I\'m going to help contribute to the things I\'d love them to go to the
widest audience possible and I assume that the US market is the largest RPG
market (perhaps the most vociferous at least!).

I should add though that for much of the rest of the world, working out out
to buy things from the States has become par for the course to obtain much
sought after Traveller material.  All that time/energy/expense makes you
love the books that much more....

Actually, as I recall the Terran Confederation either disbanded the General
Assembly or kept it as a Moot-like powerless deliberative body, disbanded
the Security Council, and gave the *Secretariat* legislative powers.  This
is the UN executive branch, headed by the Secretary-General.  The library
data is a little muddled up on these details, though. 

I get the impression that this wasn\'t an out-and-out dictatorship headed by
the Secretary-General and picked appointees, however.  Reading between the
lines, it looks almost as if the Confederation operated as a civil service
bureaucracy (gov code 8).  Many jobs would be filled by competitive civil
service examinations, possibly with hiring quotas from different nations
or regions of Terra and the "colonies".  I don\'t remember if there\'s any
information on how the Secretary-General was chosen in the Confederation,
either, or other details.  Nonetheless, it looks like both executive and
legislative powers were delegated to various bureaucrats and agencies of
the Confederation.

Still, this doesn\'t look much like a representative democracy either.  It
looks more like a proto-Imperium, minus the nobility added by the Rule of
Man and with most power concentrated on one world.

The deck plans make this a little more clear. Yes, there are big turrets
outside, but the machinery, power, targetting and whatnot take up
a lot of interior space. Each group of four turrets you see (two dorsal, two

the deck plans.

I usually map out bays as mostly internal for missiles and "mini-spinal

armament for smaller ships. Fusion, Plasma, and PA or Meson
bays on really big ships I usually map with inspiration from AHL.

Not that I\'ve finished a really, really big ship\'s deck plans yet.. :)

Not 6 days, 6 months.  If a company has an order for say 2 mason guns to be
delivered on x day to y planet then they will have a ship scheduled way in
advance that could carry that load.  Most routine cargo would travel through
scheduled shipping routes or chartered ships.  A company with production
contracts will have a contracted shipping firm to make thier deliveries on
time.  Most companies that build on contract have penalites they have to pay
if they do not deliver on time.  These are called complition bonds.  One
accoutant or billing clerk in the companies main factory or bussiness
location could funnel information to an entire pirate clan for \'processing.\'
Three or four such operatives (with some outside subsidies) and you have a
successfull enterprise that distract the empire enough to devert ships and
patrols.

Exactly.

The Imperium, as I see it, is nowhere nearly as omnipotent as most people
seem to assume.  Most citizens don\'t think of themselves as Imperials,
prefering to see themselves as Reginians, Denebians, or whatever.

IMTU, the Imperial Navy is a very small organization.  Why?  Because after
the Civil War Arbellatra wanted to make sure that what Olav (and she
herself) did was never agin possible.  The Nobles of the Moot, having been
forced to confirm Admirals who just happened to have a massive fleet in
orbit, were more than willing to go along.

The individual worlds of the Imperium were thriled that the tax rate
dropped, because it allowed them to invest in their own infrastructure,
rather than supporting massive ship-building projects dozens of parsecs
away.  Under Arbellatra worlds asserted their independence and right to
self determination.  Busy trying to rebuild the Core, Arbellatra had little
choice but to allow unheard of levels of local control.

In the modern Imperium, Naval commanders are constantly underfunded for the
missions they are given.  Fleet strength is deliberately kept low, since
experience has shown that given time, the Imperium can muster reserves to
win any war.

          "We ordered only 2,000 each of the GURPS Basic Set and GURPS

           Apparently the printers gave us some extra. A good thing, too,
because we came
           very close to selling out of the GURPS Basic Set just on
pre-orders . . . I expect
          to run out this week, except for the ones we have reserved for
direct mail sales . . .
           and GURPS Traveller won\'t be far behind.

          So if you want one of these, go bug your local retailer right
now, and beat out
           those people who don\'t read the Illuminator . . .

           -- Steve Jackson"

What this means is that the distributors snapped up 90% of the GURPS Basic
Set hardback and almost 75% of the GURPS Traveller hardback. If you want a
Traveller HARDBACK, go to your FLGS and put your order in NOW, \'cause they
won\'t be around much longer. Those of you who don\'t have a FLGS, give us a
call, and we can arrange to sell you one direct.

NOTE: The rush applies only to the HARDBACK version. We have ample supplies
of the GURPS Traveller SOFTBACK in stock and shipping. The only difference
between the two is on the cover and the binding -- the interiors are the
same.

BTW, the hardback looks pretty cool. We put a very thin line of foil
stamping on the red "laser" line on the front of the book, which allows the
"glow" effect to show through and makes the line look almost
three-dimensional. The overall effect is stunning.

This was done with my alternate modules, which were posted on this ML a bit
ago.  You can find them in the gurpsnet archives, at:
http://www.io.com/GURPSnet/Archive/Vehicles/Construction/traveller_modules

Fusion guns are created as N-PAWs with a *1.5 cost multiplier (*15 if below 10
megajoules).  These particular ones are 1 gigajoule extreme range compact
weapons with full stabilization and a universal mount; damage is 6d*500, draws
33 megawatts to fire once/second, 1/2D 4200 mi (i.e. same space combat hex),
Max 12,600 mi (immediate adjacent hexes), Acc 30.  16.8 tons, takes up 1.5
spaces(2/turret), $2.32 million.

It has _different_ constraints -- GT bases performance on mass, not volume.  As
a result, you tend to get higher acceleration in designs which have a lot of
fuel space and relatively light armor.  You also get _lower_ acceleration in
designs which have heavy armor, my attempts to design a Tigress aren\'t doing
too well.

Or to paraphrase some author who\'s name I cannot remember:

"Dictatorships are based on the belief that one person knows what\'s best
for everyone.

"Uhm, yeah, right.

"Democracies are based on the belief that a consensus or the general public

"Uhm, Yeah, right."

People seem to be too smart for semi-static institutional systems like
governments and "infallible" transponders. Technology advances, people
figure loopholes in laws, and governments are overthrown. Dangit, is there
no Utopia???

ObTrav: Assuming that Virus never happens (or happened), as does the GT
setting, what would be the Imperium\'s response to the discovery of a
"mechanical" civilization of AI machines? Say a deep-space probe from a
non-hostile, even pacifistic AI civilization jumps into Imperial space and
initiates contact (most likely, Rimward, since all the other borders seem
padded with non-3I states). Would immediate war result?

A man is walking down the street when he sees a shop advertising human
barin for sale. Intruguied, he enters.

Man:        How much for the brain?
Shopkeeper: Which type? We\'ve got scientist, engineer & lawyer.
Man:        How much is each type?
Shopkeeper: Well, the scientist brain is 20$/oz; the engineer brain is 
            30$/oz; and the lawyer brain is 3000$/oz.
Man:        3000$/oz? Why is layer brain so dear?
Shopkeeper: Have you got any idea how many lawyers you have to kill to                   
            get 1 oz of brain? 

ObTraveller: Hopefully, the far future has far less lawyers than the USA
does at present.

It is quite easily explainable. There is an issue over copyright ownership
of the DGP material (else IG could have recycled the old Alien books with
M0 added).

I know that the CORE writers who completed the Aliens Vol 1 manuscript for
IG were told not to use the DGP material directly. In other words, quoting
was banned, but paraphrasing and expanding wasn\'t.

Unless everything has changed again.

Dom

Who feels sorry for those that wrote the material for IG who haven\'t been
paid, and are now seeing a GT alien manual covering the same topic.

I read the discription but some things seem to be missing.

Twin launch tubes.

The large fighter complement.

The larger cabins for the VIPs and other special appointments.

If my memory is correct I thought the AHL class carried more fuel shuttles
or was it that they carried modular cutters to help out?  The ships boats
look a little light.  Years ago I did a \'lost is enemy space\' campain with
the characters as crew on a \'battle scout\' running point for a stranded AHL
class group deep the rebelious teritory (Sword worlds confederation and the
frontier beyond).  Seems I remember that the AHL took quite a bit to refuel.
Many of the adventures were getting spare parts for the ship and finding
safe places to refuel and repair.  That and a few comando raids on
industrial planets to shake up the rebels a bit.

Also I never considered the AHL as a sucky ship.  It was a \'frontier
cruiser\'.  Made to be a jack of all trades.  Not a battle queen.  It had the
room to add almost anything it needed for special missions or carry the
supplies for a long cruise.

PS:  Does anybody have an idea about the support\\escort ships a AHL class
would have in a patrol or \'show the flag\' mission?

It might be that it had a large number of 40-ton shuttles, not a small number
of 400-ton shuttles.

Um...Mod/6 computer sucks outright, particularly on a 60 kT ship.  2 Gs and
agility 0 kinda sucks too.

Hm...kind of a shortage of jump-5 supply or escort ships.  I think the AHL is
supposed to be mainly self-sufficient.

Well, drilling for oil in the middle of Sweden comes to mind. Of course,
that may have been a scam from the beginning. (At least it was a
phenomenally bad idea that quite a few people lost quite a bit of money on.)
Hmm. Perhaps pirates would arrange shares scams to get the money to buy
their ships? (Or, more likely, just take the money and run. ;-)

I\'m not a New Zealander, but yes, it is. It going to be directed by Peter

It increases the DR of internal walls and bulkheads, as well as some other

The point, however, is that hi pop worlds will be able to buy a good SDB
defense, since hi pop worlds tend to have lots of credits to throw around.
And a good SDB defense kills piracy dead, dead, dead -- dead as freakin\'
stone. ;-)

Disclaimer: Given the nature of the information we have (i.e., incomplete),
there is no real conclusion one can make about piracy in the 3I except that
it exists in the setting\'s "canon." Many (including myself) seem to think
piracy makes little sense as presented in published material, but "say
lah-vee!" (as we stupid, non-French-speaking Americans sometimes say).

In G: Vehicles the effect is to divide by 5 or 10 all leakage results, and to
reduce the odds of developing a leak in vacuum or various unpleasant
atmospheres.  No effect is listed in GT; I\'d say that for a vehicle without
compartmentalization taking 10% of hit points means the vehicle is considered
depressurized; this would wait until 50% or 100% for partial or total
compartmentalization.

	True, but if most of the population is on the mainworld, these

	This doesn\'t make any economic sense at all.  Freight is freight 
and should be carried at a Cr/ton rate.  It doesn\'t cost the shipper any 
more to carry 1 ton of computer chips than 1 ton of grain.  If you and I 
were the only ship captains available and you wanted to charge 5% of the 
value of the cargo of computer chips, I could underbid you at 4% and still 
make a fortune.  You in turn could under bid me, etc. until we had 
competed our price down close to our costs.  Our costs will be 
determined by volume, not value/volume, so that is all our final 
price will depend on.  BTW, this is called a Bertrand game in economics.

	It\'s not viable if you stick to the fixed ticket prices.  If 
someone wants to travel 6 pcs and they\'re willing to pay the cost, why 
not take them?

	Debt is a problem in the Third World for many complicated reasons,
at least some that are no fault at all of the 3W leaders or people.  That
said, the plan you describe of only importing capital goods is known in
economic development circles as Import-Substitution Industrialization.  It
was tried extensively in Latin America in the post-WWII period and for the
most part failed miserably.  Efforts to reduce import dependence through
ISI wound up increasing it instead because of the need to import more
intermediate and capital goods which were then employed at lower
efficiency than they were in their home markets.  ISI countries also had
fewer export earnings to pay for their imports because investment focused
on those industries where the country was _least_ competitive and
therefore imported the most.  All of this resulted in severe balance of
payments problems and debt. There is no economic reason that 3W countries
should chronically be in debt.  The answer usually lies in the poor
decisions of 3W politicians, and the bad advice of 1W gov\'ts and bankers. 

ObTrav:  The frequency of low-TLs can be partly explained by the 
misguided policies of gov\'ts or the short-sighted avarice of 
off-worlders.  Balance of Payments and debt crises like we\'re seeing in 
the Real World could also be novel settings for adventures.
  
> Interest rates in the Imperium?
> Low, because the place has been stable for 1000 years.

	Agreed.  Given the slow pace of TL change, we have to assume that 
the opportunities for profitable investment are low, hence the low demand 
for capital, i.e. low interest rates.

> Prime rates : not more than 3-5%

	Given that starships, a low to moderate risk investment, are 6%, 
this seems reasonable.

	The vast majority of the Imperium is months travel from an 
international border.  Furthermore, even once across the pirate could 
face arrest and extradition unless relations between the two polities are 
so poor that no such agreements exist.

	But a High pop world will have more than enough SDBs to make 
piracy an extremely hazardous if not impossible proposition.  Worlds with 
enough trade to be worth pirating are worth defending.  Worlds not worth 
defending have little trade worth pirating.

Depends.  Most are only that, but the same goes for politicians, inventors,
farmers, military leaders, etc.  Although at my school, about 10% were
engineers about 5% accountants and about 1% were doctors.  But
I expect that is atypical.  I was the only redneck, but one of two
booksellers (real bookseller, not mall bookstore cashier).

Thats great!  I would only modify is to say that its the technically good
ones that create all the technicalities and complexity, that are often
unnecessary, while the much rarer morally good ones usually practice
in obscurity.

The quote reminds me of a discussion I had with an engineer friend
at law school.  I said something along the lines of that quote about
medical school and he responded:  The reason that most of these
law students are in law school, is that they are totally incapable
of understanding science enough to be doctors or engineers.

He was right.  Most of these fresh lawyers now working on Wall
Street and State Street and all the other places where people lives are
can be affected by small mistakes, have never balanced a checkbook
or paid their own rent.

Well, since a GURPS playtest waaaaay back when, the value of a
guy who can keep everyone out of jail was imprinted on me.  So,
I tend to keep their wallets down by forcing them to hire expensive
lawyers.  They\'ll get the point eventually.  ;-)

The risk I take in discussing the Task Resolution system on the net is that
some people will want to revise it, rather than comment on it and how it
works. If the discussion is "I won\'t use it because it uses the half die,"
then perhaps they should continue to use MT or CT or even GT. There is clearly
little (if any) possibility that the half-die will be eliminated. In fact, the
argument that the half die is only used in tasks has prompted me to consider
other places where it can logically be used as well.

The current task and skill system is available as a zipped file from
FarFuture@AOL.com. My hope is that people will use it and play it and point
out failings and inconsistencies in it so that it can be well-edited and
tested when it comes out in T5.

Has been reporting on this story and surrounding rumors for almost a year.
There has been contradictory information about whether its the Hobbit live
action,.
the LOTR live action, or LOTR animated.  Very confusing and doesn\'t make
sense.

A few months ago, it was confirmed that something live action was being
done
but not which.  Then, IIRC, the funding got pulled by one studio, but
another
may have picked it up.

There was a level of secrecy about the same as the Star Wars prequels.

Most of these craft wouldn\'t be able to keep up. It\'s been a tenet
since the 1940\'s that you group your combat units by mobility.

The only reason to use an AHL is it\'s Jump-5 capability. With the
exception of a couple cruiser models (_Gionnetti_?), there\'s little in the 
Imperial fleet built to that standard. 

I\'d say some fleet couriers would come along, Jump-6.

You can\'t really use a tanker effectively in Jump-5 operations - 
fuel requirements for the tanker to jump twice are over 100%,
keep the tankers to give longer legs to the short-jump units.

Except for the IISS\'s own Azhanti High Lightnings (some were
transferred for use as really cool exploration cruisers), we haven\'t
seen anything for the IISS in the J-5 range - no scout ships, but that\'s
probably a role the 80 fighters on the AHL are best for anyway.

Unless the Navy has a fleet of j-5 support vessels (doubtful due
to Imperial standard for fleet being j-4), I\'ll bet you\'ll see AHL\'s
pretty much alone or in poorly supported CruRons. I\'d hope such
ships were allowed to use the optional rules allowing fighters
to act in an anti-missile role.

IIRC, there are several examples of AHL\'s acting alone. One that comes
to mind is the loss of the _Vermillion Stance_ to the "perfidious
Zhodani" in 1042 in the Garonne system (0102 Haldensleben\\Vanguard
Reaches). _Vermillion Stance_ was on her own when the Zhodani
spec force unit took her, no one knew her fate until years later
when some of her crew were returned (by accident?) in a prisoner
exchange.

btw, the data presented in Jim Vassilakos\' excellent Galactic program
disagrees here with canon. The supplement describing the loss of
_Vermillion Stance_ (the scenario backgrounds from the AHL rulebook)
indicates a situation where it would be impossible for Aslan, Imperial
or even most interstellar foriegn representatives to be present in-system.
The data for Garonne indicates a rescue operation by an ad-hoc
alliance of Imperial Marines and Aslani warriors that succeeded in
freeing an Aslani ambassador, but was too late to recapture 
_Vermillion Stance_. Any of these combatants could have revealed
the fate of the ship, which is supposed to have been unknown to
the Imperium until after the Fourth Frontier War, some 42 years later.

Unless something else happened to these brave souls on their way back
home, that is.

    'body' => 'Rather than relying on anectodal evidence so beloved by demagogues and
politicians everywhere, I thought I\'d actually look at how repressive
the 3I is to the average citizen.

There are two UWP codes associated with the \'repressiveness\': Gov and
Law.

Government types are pretty much scattered as ytypes, not a spectrum as
is law, so what we can do is look at the pertinent data.

There are two explicit Democracies in the UWP codes, 2 (Participatory
Democracy) and 4 (Representative Democracy). There are also two
non-democratic, but popularly supported government codes Charismatic
Dictator (A) and Charismatic Oligarchy (C)

Law can be ranked as a scalar from 0 (no law) to L (Total Repression)

Law levels in Traveller are heavily 2nd amendment weighted: _all_ that
counts is weapons possesion. 

Still it will give us the only estimate we can make of the general
repressiveness of the legal system.

I\'m using the 2nd survey data from the archives, and look at two cases,
the total Imperium and the Spnward Marches only. The reason for this is
that (per the article in the last Challenge magazine) There are
significant problems with the Non-Spinward Marchesdata...it was clearly
generated by a computer with a poor random number generator. The
Marches, as the most used, most worked over sector, we\'ll make the
assumption that it is more accurate.

Summary data (tables to follow in another post)

Looking at government types, the democratic governments represent 16.48%
of the total population of the 3I, popular governments represent 21.7%. 
Ok, not the majority, but a solid minority nonetheless.

In the Spinward Marches the numbers are 24.84% for democracies, and
popular governments are 28.45%. nearly a third of the poulation lives
under either a representative government or one that has their
confidence.

Law levels are, IMO, far more representative of the repressive character
of a governent. All levels 7 and below are moderate to low law, and
pretty well represent the majority of the \'Western Democracies\' of the
present day.

On this basis, 70% of the total Imperium, and 63% of the Spinward
Marches populations live in moderate to low law level worlds.

Extreme Law worlds, which I would consider definitely repressive, (A and
above) account for just 13% of the population of the full Imperium, and
17.4% of the population of the Spinward Marches.

The REASON there isn\'t a widespread revolt against the Evil Monster
Third Imperium, is that the large majority of the population feels that,
however the mechanism of rule, they\'re being ruled in a just fashion.

Of course it is a stretch from Law Level to satisfaction of the
populace, but it\'s the only measuring stick we\'ve got.

IMTU, I solve the anti-democracy debate (and other debates) by having
megacorp lawyers and the IGLF (Ine Givar Legal Front) constantly trying
to limit the powers of the Imperium.  This is compounded by a heavy

Not quite anyone: they have to be US citizens, State Residents (ooohh... 30
days for voter registration... so they can\'t vote the first 60 days),
cannot be felons, and must be mentally fit. (Although that last is quite
lax, as many of the Down\'s Sysndrome adults are registered voters!)

sorry Walt, you lose that wager. 1/3 of elligibles to register do so, if
that.  Since I work elections, I get to see turnout directly as a % of
REGISTERED voters - usually 23-28 %.

in a typical anchorage voting precinct, there will be 1000 - 1500
residences minimum, with an average occupancy somewhere around 1.5-3. Rule
out non-citizens, Felons, and the mentally incompetent, and you wind up
with around 1500-2000 persons elligible. And then compare to the precinct
registers (which average 400-600). Some precincts are worse, since
precincts are apportioned by registered voters in precinct, limited to
existing district boundaries.

Yeah, RIght... At least, during a presidential, more people register.

This sounds like it would work well, and keep JOT from becoming too
powerful. I would like to see a cap on how many levels of JOT a character
is allowed to have, but aside from that, this sounds very workable.

I thought there was more than one?  No back up?  That does suck it that is

Wasn\'t there some escorts listed for it in the AHL class book?  I though

needed to.

You jump them BEFORE they get to the high pop. world.  The jump route is
what you get from your industrial spy.  And just how many SDBs does it take
to take on two Varga pirate cruisers (plus support ships) each armed with
meson gun spinal mounts?  AKA the traveller adventure?

Piracy probably can pay with good information and good fences.  Perhaps not
as a full time job, except maybe for comerce raiders, but as a once in a
while bonus it could be done.  It could improve your bottom line by quite a bit.

Depends.  Most are only that, but the same goes for politicians, inventors,
farmers, military leaders, etc.

Back then, quite a few people were more than one of the above.
George Washington was a farmer, writer, military leader, professional
surveyor, inventor (his innovative design for a round-walled barn made
threshing quite a bit easier, and was well-recieved), and statesman.
He wasn\'t atypical in this respect, at least for a landowner.

I haven\'t seen the career breakdown, but I don\'t recall that many
of the representatives to the constitutional convention being
practicing lawyers.

Black Globes are (normally) Ancients artifacts which absorb all energy
directed at them (hence black, like a Black Hole but without the Gravity).
It is a kind of force field in which the absorbed energy is stored in
dedicated \'capacitors\' or the jump drive\'s \'capacitors\'. If the storage is
exceeded the ship will explode catastrophically.

Ships which use black globes cannot see out or manouever unless they
\'flicker\' the globe. This also allows them to dissipate stored energy from
the ship. The Globe would then absorb a proportion of attacking energy.
Firing out can be synchronised with the flicker, so can avoid penalties.

BG\'d ships are effectively invisible until you know they are there, after
which they can easily be engaged as they must move in a straight line under
fully globed conditions. It is possible to jump with a globe up, sail past
defending forces and then engage the rear lines. Some BG\'s may be
prototypes for the Imperial Navy.

At higher Traveller tech levels >TL18 IIRC the White Globe becomes
available. It isn\'t as stealthy but you can at least see out.

Nuclear Dampers - project forces which either accelerate the decay of
nuclear material or retard it. This will kill a nuclear missile if focused
on it.

Nuclear missiles are strictly the reserve of Imperial vessels (under the
Imperial Rules of War - which may not be in GT), as are biological and
chemical weapons. However, some systems may use them. In TNE and T4
(previous editions) missiles became nuclear detonation lasers (a nuclear
bomb \'pumps\' an X ray laser). However, GT is based on Classic Traveller and
MegaTraveller which used conventional nuclear warheads.

It was set in 98, in M0, with the players becoming aides to a Duke (of
Shudushaam) who was involved in opposing Artemus\' actions incorporating the
worlds bypassed under the Xahdunemo policy, and was looking to a return to
a republic (an idealised Sylean Federation). The players become caught
between the Imperial BIA, the moderate faction, and the extremists who want
to kill Artemus (who will probably fragment the Imperium). Anyway, the
adventure ends with a resolution of sorts, with the players and the Duke
heading for Sylea for his acceptance/recognition at the Moot.

I plan to write the second part this winter for next summers\' cons. This is
the one were the players become inconvenient to Artemus, foil the coup, and
end up being ennobled, and effectively exiled to the frontier to establish
a colony. They are led off by an older man who describes himself as
\'troubleshooter\' for the colonisation effort, and mentions his name is
Cleon... Anyway, the point is the moderates will end up supporting the
status quo to avoid the chaos of reversion to something like the Sylean
Federation...

I see where you\'re coming from now. Personally, I\'m working on breaking it
to the players ever so gently, and ending up with them having to make an
awkward decision about morals and ethics, and which is the lesser evil.

Milieu 0 was slated for being too dark and repressive. Some people on the
list questioned the whole ethos of the game, asking where all the heroes
had gone to, why was it so brutal, etc.....

Well, to be blunt, empire building isn\'t nice. The British Empire wasn\'t
\'nice\'. The Colonies weren\'t set up on a democratic basis, even if the home
islands were a democracy(*). It was all driven by money, profit, trade and
perhaps an urge for glory.

Anyone who thinks that the Imperium was built with fluffy niceness is
naive, IMO. We demand scientific realism from the game but fail to look at
the historical precedents for a realistic background. It isn\'t *Star Trek*.

>IMTU, it is still alive on countless worlds both inside and outside of
>the 3I.

Worlds may be democracies in Traveller but the Imperium is feudal and
repressive (when it wants to be). Look at Adventure 1 (/The Kinuir/) and
the imprisoned senator if you don\'t believe me. There may be great beliefs,
but there is also a harsh reality. A democracy of 30 Trillion people
spanning hundreds of parsecs and thousands of systems is not workable from
a time basis alone.

</RANT>

The Moot is the closest thing to a democratic body in the Imperium. It
does, at least, debate things. And the Traveller background has always had
the opportunity to become noble for your acts etc..

Dom

* And you can argue that the UK wasn\'t a democracy in the sense that all
had equal rights.

Hi Dom/tc,

Please inform Steve, and the TML if appropriate, that I apologise for the
mistake (as publisher it\'s my responsibility to ensure we get it right!) and
the next print run of 101 Religions will be updated to include Steve\'s name.
We only did a short run for launch at Gen Con, so the major print run will
have the corrected version.

That is the way it is in the \'real world\', too.  A Swiss Army knife makes a 
good emergency toolkit, but *nothing* beats a good chest full of dedicated 
tools.  The CT and HG design philosopies reflect this.

Depends on what you mean by performance.  You want something that will survive 
a full blown firefight, go with a battle rider.  You want something that you 
can run like hell if the battle goes south, get a real starship.

One area where this could be used. obviously, is in damage ratings for
weapons, to give a little more variation than was present in T4.
Bottom line: It\'s your game. The presence of the half-die, which never
bugged me all that much (despite a recent post in which I said I wished for
a task system without it), will not deter me from using T5, if it\'s a
well-designed and generally excellent game. I admit, it will take a LOT at
this point to get me to run Traveller in anything other than the GURPS
system, but that\'s simply because I like and am very familiar with GURPS.
But if t5 is good enough, anything is possible. and I will most certainly
test it out and say what I think :) and yes, I will be buying T5 when it
finally comes out.

You will have temporary disparities between SDB levels and amount of

strike before the newly-elected Miner\'s Rights Committee even gets

always be star systems that don\'t percieve a threat, and therefore
underbuy their SDB coverage, or overestimate the capabilites or
readiness of their SDB coverage. They\'ll quickly get the hint, but it 
may take months to obtain new (or replacement) patrol craft. 

Of course, the moment the brand new SDB\'s show up, the pirates will
make themselves scarce. It won\'t be long before the taxpayers
start wondering why a MCr200+ each fleet is doing search & rescue.
"Pirates? There aren\'t any pirates around here!" - and thus the cycle
will begin again, the SDB flotilla suffering cutbacks until it can\'t
do it\'s real job of piracy suppression anymore.

(This assumes we aren\'t talking about a world prepping to defend itself
against another state like the Zho - such a system would almost
always be suicide for a pirate)

A couple nice 400tn Patrol Cruisers (like the one from CT, or the
famous Gazelle-class CE) could solve this problem for a rack of
worlds that can\'t each effectively field an SDB force. Circulate the
patrol through the group of worlds on anti-piracy duty, their possible
presence may be enough to discourage pirate activity. I could even
see a single medium-pop world surrounded by low-pop worlds
footing the bill itself: even if your SDB force is up to snuff, it may
not be able to do it\'s job if unpatrolled pirate havens are one jump
away from you.

I suppose you could buy a couple of tenders and ship SDB\'s to these
frontier worlds if you wanted to instead.

Common-sense answer sez, if your hull gets holed, you\'re going to lose what 
was in the compartment.  Total compartmentalisation would limit the damage to 
that compartment.  An uncompartmentalised ship could take collatteral damage 
in adjacent compartments.

I believe this was an exception and not the rule.  I would think that the
IN would get mighty annoyed at having foreign flagged or outlaw cruisers
running around preying on merchant traffic.  Remember the campaign at the
end of the FFW?  The IN devoted fleets to run down and eliminate the Vargr
renegades.

I didn\'t like the idea at first, then I played it. It doesn\'t bother me
anymore. I hope you carry on trialing material broadly either here on the
TML or on the TWG.

Same could be said of Military structures, albeit with mroe levels.... and
a military occupation already has rules of succession in force until
replacements arrive.

Hear, hear!

Most of the IN ships that we\'ve seen have been built to a J4/6G standard,
which is enough to keep up with most BatRons, but insufficient for CruRon
support.  Of course, high-jump ships are exceptionally expensive, so it\'s
not a major surprise.

If you think the obsolescent AHL has it bad, consider the rift cruiser;
the only other thing that can pace them *are* those jump-6 fleet couriers,
which may lead to fleet couriers being used as very pricy close escorts in
that sort of CruRon.  (Interestingly, acceleration isn\'t an issue -- like
the AHL, the rift cruiser has "short legs".)

Last I\'d heard, the DUNE RPG was licensed to Last Unicorn Games, the folks
who have out out the excellent Star Trek the Next Generation game.

Actually the Dune RPG (like the Dune CCG) is being put out by Last
Uniciorn Games, the folks who recently did the Star Trek RPG.  The Dune
RPG will use the same rules engine as the Star Trek game.  It will be out
sometime in 1999 (I currently have no idea of a more accurate date).  It\'s
being written now.

IMTU, quite a few IN warships carry traditional Terran names, thus
leading to the old saying, "If you can\'t bring the Vargr pirates to
Missouri, bring MISSOURI to the Vargr pirates!"  (HIMS MISSOURI is, BTW,
a TL-15 500,000 Td battleship, currently being reworked under Andrew
Akins\' FF&S spreadsheet ver 3.2 [updating from ver 2.6].)

IMTU only a minority of the low TL worlds actually have low tech
levels.  The majority, especially those with small populations, don\'t
have local production facilities for high TL equipment but actually do
use fairly high TL equipment.  For example, the areas on the Navajo
reservation that are not high population density (most of it) don\'t
typically have high tech manufacturing abilities.  I can\'t think of
any plants that produce modern microprocessors for example.  On the
other hand, most homes have TVs, VCRs, fairly new trucks, etc.  The
local construction industry is still mainly concrete for some floors
and a few walls, and timber with mud chinking for most walls and some
ceilings.
Certainly there are some planets that have a genuinely low TL, but
those are mostly the high population worlds that have low TLs. 
Smaller populations don\'t have the resources to maintain a high TL in
most cases.  The low pop/low TL worlds tend to be places that are
mining camps or specialized agricultural products, etc. based in their
economies and just import whatever technical products they need.

In My Campaign...

The major commercial freight and passenger services have monopolised the
\'trade routes\' that are so laboriously mapped out on the sector maps, to
the point that there are no \'free traders\' operating on those lines.  The
free traders operate between worlds on the trade routes, and worlds off of
them.  Their service is pricier and less reliable, but beggars can\'t be
choosers.

It\'s not a multimillion dollar investment if you kill your captain and run
off, or spend a few thousand on tickets and take over the ship.

I have independently decided that they offer +50% and +100% hit points,
respectively, and they represent not only toughening up the bulkheads but
also redundant cabling and armor on critical systems.

Thank you.

Since the GT system assumes power included with each weapon, I will have to
reduce the power somewhat to make it fit that system, and add accumulators
to make it fire once per minute instead.  Unfortunately, that is likely to
reduce the range even further...

No, I don\'t think so... but relations would certainly be even more strained

I doubt the Imperium would be interested in, for example, allowing Machine

Would it?  Just a single ship?  If a single incident would cause the entire
Imperium to go to war, then it would probably be at war all of the time.

How about ten?  A hundred?  Perhaps the Enemy wants to know how far they
can push the \'Big 3I\' and uses privateering to find out?  "When we take
thirty ships a year, they complain... when we take three hundred a year,
they send a task force...  when we take three thousand a year, they
threaten war... next year we take seven hundred and see what happens..."

I don\'t think that most pirates engage in piracy all of the time.  I\'d say
the most likely eventuality is the way the Vikings used to do it... when
they were in hostile territory, they were merchants... buying and selling
like everyone else.  When they thought they could get away with it, they\'d
sail in, smash and grab, and take the loot home.  If they were ruthless
enough, they needn\'t give away their identities, at least not for some time.

Yes.  My point was that this kind of person doesn\'t really exist anymore.
_All_ carreers are more concentrated, not just lawyers.  The farmer,
military leader, surveyor, etc., etc., is largely a thing of the past.

Well, I would be extrememly suprised if less than 60% had JDs.
The last time I paid attention, which was 15 years ago,
the vast majority had been lawyers previously.

Sure...you use a \'stage\' theory like modern rockets.  Unfortunately, the
scaling required is horrible -- you halve your available tonnage roughly every
4-5 parsecs, which means you need something like a million-ton base craft to
get a scout across the rift.  If you have drop tanks it\'s somewhat easier,
halving around every 8 parsecs.  Filling tanks with liquid methane and then
processing it after jump gives you another 50% or so.  Still not exactly
practical unless you can find a star in the middle.

Just my small thoughts on this...

I think a good cost-effective way of dealing w/ the SDB force is to take them
out FIRST.  A couple of high-powered ships might ambush an SDB (false distress
signal, maybe?)  If you can take the ship out, thats good; if you can take the
ship, thats even better.   A nice 400-ton sub merchie can cram a lot of
troopies in the cargo bay if necessary...and if you can get the ship to a
freeport, you might be able to strip and salvage quite a bit.   SDB\'s will
rarely, if ever, operate in squadron size to take out one pirate...and no star
system, no matter how rich it is, will spend more money for defense than it
feels it has too.  So at worst, you may have 2 SDBs responding to a typical
distress call (you might be able to thin this out w/ other "rescues" to deal
with.) 

Granted that this requires a fair amount of starting capital...but it should
be a reasonably self-sustaining affair once it gets going.  However, this
would not be a once a week type of thing; it would require intelligence on the
target, the system, the system defenses, and a nearby staging base (maybe in-
system, around a GG moon?)   One hit a month or so, if the haul is big enough
(according to CT Trade Tables, 200 tons of Radioactives sell for 1MCr
BASE...never mind the brokers skill at selling it!)  That will pay for a fair
amount of upkeep and supplies...BCr 2.4 per year, at the above assumptions.
This will take a lot of the small-fry out of the game, but that seems
realistic to me.

A small, professional force of pirates, executing well-planned paramilitary-
style operations against very lucrative targets seems to me to be the only way
piracy worked (much like modern day art or jewel thieves)

It includes capacitors to fire every minute (it also actually only takes up 672
cf, or 1.344 spaces).  Adding a sufficient power plant is 3.33 tons and 400 cf,
for a total of 2.144 spaces; reducing it to 1.5 spaces requires a 30% reduction

21.4 tons total, 1.572 MCr, range 3600/10,700, Acc 29.

Note that the whole theory behind including the power plants in the guns is
somewhat fishy, since it means that a chunk of fusion reactor is in the turret
(which seems unlikely) and that you need to upgrade your power plant to add
weaponry (which means people can\'t swap out weapons very well).  This is why I
wrote up modules which separate out the power plant.

If you can kill off the system defenses in a system, you aren\'t really pirates
any more -- you\'re more like well-armed raiders, and piracy is at best
incidental to what you\'re really doing -- if you\'ve cleared system defenses,
you might as well loot the planet as well as sitting there gobbling up
merchants as they enter the system.  However, invading and holding a system is
the kind of thing which gets you large-scale military responses from the
relevant government....

Thanks for doing the math for me.

Actually... they explain that the chunk of fusion reactor ISN\'T in the
turret, it\'s down there with the reactor... which means that a three-space
turret really isn\'t a three-space turret at all, but something like a
one-space turret with space set aside elsewhere for the power and the
capacitors.

It makes things a bit easier when designing the ship.

As for swapping out weapons, on paper at least it makes it easier, because
you can swap out the weapon and the power it needs at the same time.

One thing it doesn\'t allow for is the ability to design a ship with less
power than it needs to operate ABSOLUTELY everything, in other words, to
design a ship with a doctrine that states that (for example) the spinal
mount particle beam and the maneuver drive will not be used simultaneously.

You should not look at my comments as venomous, but as constructive, as they are
meant to be.  I love the game, and I would like to see the game be the best it can
be.  The half die in your system seems very haphazard to me, and I am incredulous
that you insist on keeping it in there.

I feel about this the way I do about the movie Aliens IV.  They\'ve got this great
franchise.  They\'ve got a good first movie and a awesome second movie (and a third
that\'s not so hot).

Then, they go in and mess up the genre with that super-action comic-booky mess
they put on the screen with Aliens IV.

It\'s like when Kirk died in the Star Trek films:  does anybody here not know in
their hearts that Kirk should have died on the bridge of a ship, snapping out
order, sacrificing himself and his ship in order to save the day?

The half die in Traveller\'s task system is like Kirk falling off that bridge.  It
just shouldn\'t be done.  We shouldn\'t have to fix it later after we buy the book.

I know people, especially Marc, are tired of this topic, so I guess I should just
acquiesce and accept the doggon thing.

However, in the shipyard it makes it harder, because most likely a pre-existing
power plant isn\'t _designed_ to suddenly have an X megawatt chunk added to it,
which means that if you put in a new weapon system you put in a new engine...

This is why the arguments about conservation of energy are important; if you
do the above you find you don\'t conserve energy. (In essence, in a frame in
which the planet is at rest, moving it in any direction *adds* to the planet\'s
energy, while moving the spacecraft adds to the spacecrafts energy - and
adds more energy per unit time the faster the spacecraft is going.)

Like I said, the numbers have to be played with.  I think, ideally, that a
Difficult task for an average joe should have about a 20% chance of success.

Just like the quote you used above, I\'m talking concept:  subtract stats from the
difficulty number;  skills give you a bonus of die equal to the level.

I don\'t take your comments as venomous. I actually think you are trying to be

But I also thought I had come to a conclusion on this point several months
ago, and moved forward from there. Reaching back and talking about wholesale
revision of the task system at this point misses the current goal I have... to
make what I have here consistent and workable with the errors rooted out of
it.

What???

Let\'s take a frame in which the planet is at rest.  Here\'s the sequence of
events:

The ship grabs up some hudrogen, fuses it into helium, and releases a
little bit of that matter into energy.  Some of that energy goes to the
ship\'s engines, which pushes the ship and the planet apart.  The ship gains
momentum, the planet gains momentum, and the fuel tank loses a little fuel.

What is the problem with this?

And if you do the *bookkeeping* differently, racking up the power
requirements as you go along and installing a power plant at the end that
fulfills these requirements, how is it different?  The only difference is
in the design phase... in both cases, at the end, you still have one power
plant.

Remember, this is only a bookkeeping stratagem, to make designing ships
easier.

They mentioned an AHL ship rendezvousing with a flotilla of Gazelles
for commerce raider duties, so they would have been operating at
Jump-4 (unless the AHL or a support ship with them had spare
drop tanks along). Considering how many ops you can do at Jump-2,
you should often have at least half tanks.

Too bad for the Alaskans then. And anyone else who gives up and

they deserve. I\'ll have to share some of it, which sucks, but hey,
life is seldom fair.

Your view of the US as a "self selecting oligarchy" is just downright
silly, though. You can\'t blame those who decide to take part in
their government for the irresponsibility of those who don\'t.

You don\'t have to have served in the military. You don\'t need to be
gainfully employed. You can even be a convicted felon, as long as
you aren\'t locked up at the time. You don\'t even have to know how
to read the ballot. Tell me again how this exclusionary system works
to create an oligarchy?

Heck, I\'ve even seen some evidence that we allow more people to 
vote than the founding fathers ever intended. :)

Since anyone with Admin-1 or better can function as a a lawyer, probably
they\'ve got more.  Maybe there aren\'t as many full time lawyers though,
since futuristic data-retrieval would make it easier to research precedents
and such, and oratory skills aren\'t as important when arguing before an
Imperial Tribunal.  Maybe it\'s something people do on the side, like being a
Notary Public is now?

I\'m not sure where you get this.  And even if it is canon somewhere,
I beg to differ with it.  Very strongly.

Beg to differ again.  You\'ve got to speak the language so you know
what precedent really says, assuming precendent is binding, which it isn\'t
in most of the planet, and IMTU, not to the Imperium.  And oratory skills
are vital!  Especially before an Imperial tribunal.  They can and do make
huge differences.  Their even more important in systems in which
precedent is not binding.

If being a lawyer were that easy, there would be a lot more
than there are.  FYI, there are less than 1,000,000 practicing
lawyers in the United States.  The number is actually between
800k and 700k.  Pakistan has a higher lawyer pre capita ratio
than the US.

This is true, however if the drop tank services are new, they may not know
about the increases in misjump chances.

    PDA\'s are capable of having books loaded on \'em.  I\'ve got several chapters of ERB\'s
"The Mucker" and "The Shadow Unmasked" loaded on my PalmPilot.  As well as The Book 
of Five Rings and multiple character notes.

   Of course, a paper book can be real useful if you can\'t figure out what

Interesting take, and I can see it too.  Then there is that Grayson
dueling style that, although not detailed, sure sounded very
Kendo-ish.

You never know...  The 3I might just see this as a way to extend their
power...

Think of it this way, in the next war,  the navy may be made up of AI
controled ships...  Could lower the loss of life & increase force
projection...

The crew quarters are now fuel....

Maybe, maybe not...  If the 3I will let Sho ships in to trade, why not AI
ships?

Each to their own, but given the choice between, "Quick!

I\'ll take the subtraction. ;->  But that\'s just me.

Unlike some people, I\'m not making suggestions to Marc about task
systems for T5.  He\'s decided what he wants to do, so there\'s no
point.  OTOH, the task, chargen, combat, or whatever systems each of
us choose to use when we play Traveller doesn\'t *have* to conform to
any published version of the game, that\'s our individual business.
I\'m content to post ideas, ignore them if you aren\'t interested,
comment if you are. 


Now a more fleshed out idea...

How about including another Task level on either side of Difficult
and matching the Tasks with FUDGE like description Skill Levels?
And while we\'re at it, though in a little touch of point
distribution.

   Task        Task     Skill/Stat   Skill/Stat
Description  Modifier   Description     Level
===============================================
Easy           +12      Terrible          1
Routine         +8      Poor              2
Moderate        +4      Mediocre          3
Difficult        0      Fair              4
Formidable      -4      Good              5
Staggering      -8      Great             6
Hopeless       -12      Superb            7
Impossible     ----      Legendary         8+

Distribute 24 points among 6 Characteristics (1 to 6) [4 points per
characteristic if you use more or less than 6].  The only way to get
above 6 is to roll it during a career.

Careers are rolled up using a system similar to T4/T5, or TNE or MT
for that matter.  ;-) Personally, I\'d like to get some occupational
specialization into the system.  Foex, it\'s fine to have a Navy
Career, but within the Navy you have Line, Staff and Engineering
Departments with pretty different skill sets...this is more CTA or
MT like than the later systems.

Roll 1d6-1 the first time each skill is learned.  On subsequent
selection of each skill increase the level by 1.  This simulates the
boost to learning on first exposure and the slower pace on later
exposures.  I suppose getting a 0 for first learning is also
realistic, the person with very low aptitude for the subject.

Assets are always a combination of two Characteristics, two Skills
or 1 Characteristic and 1 Skill.  Roll less or equal to the Asset
modified by Task difficult and other DM\'s.

I\'ve toyed with using a 3d6 or 2d6 scale rather than 1d20, but to be
honest I think the 1d20 works better.  Probably, not as "realistic"
as it\'s a uniform rather than a normal-like distribution, but this
is a game and, IMO, simple and fast beats realistic.  

I really like having that 1 die for Task resolution, and being
non-d6 is actually an advantage.  For combat I can put the 1d20 and
a handful of d6\'s in a cup and roll them at once.  If the d20
indicates a hit, I already have the damage rolled on the d6\'s.

Anyway, just an idea.

Thats for space combat.  In the time of a round, its assumed that you can
change
the facing and thrust vector to whatever you want because you have the time
to make such changes..  But the manuever drive still pushes the ship in the
direction of its \'nose\'

I think its also assumed that minor thrusters are placed in appropriate places

to provide attitude control, i.e., yaw, pitch, and roll.

Sending a SDB to respond to a distress call is, in my opinion, like sending
a Los Angeles class nuke boat to respond to one. You use launches,
preferably ones with specialised medical etc equipment.

False distress signals also run an amusing risk ... an ethically-challenged
civilian (or, for that matter, an ethically-challenged planetary

wont be any objection to claiming you as salvage.

I also disagree about sending out SDBs in squadron size to take out
identified pirates. Why not send three ships and make it an unfair fight ?

Thruster-plate powered missiles also make excellent fire support. If it
turns out to be an actual civilian, turn it for home.

Any ship carrying high-value cargos is going to have serious amounts of
firepower itself, if the space lanes are not secure. Our hypothtical
MC1/dton cargo would be far more likely to be carried in something like a
2000 dton Elisabeth-class \'Frontier Trader\' (2.1 gigajoules of laser output
and all) than a dinky little 200 dton Far Trader.

Yeah. Modern day jewel thieves dont use or need privately-owned frigates.

This has been discussed in enormous mathematical detail -see the archives.
The very short version is that if you do the numbers, under most 
circumstances you find the kinetic energy of a t-plate ship is going up
much faster than the amount of power going into its engines. If you look
at it slightly more closely, you discover that the rate of kinetic energy
gain of a constantly-accelerating ship is not constant, but proportional to
its velocity, and hence once they\'re moving fast enough t-plate ships will
always break conservation of energy no matter how high you set the power
requirement. (Proof left as excercise for reader - please look in the
archives.) 

It\'s from this little fact that relativistic rocks and planet-busting-lifeboats
arise...

That\'s the *theory* ... but it *actually* does a whole hell of a lot more ...
all, in reality, to keep itself in control and with absolute (if not always
obviously used) power.

I was not commenting on the quantitative non-conservation aspect of
reactionless thrusters.  I was commenting on the qualitative comment that
since the ship and the planet had both gained momentum (energy) then there
was therefore a lack of conservation.

I just wanted to point out that the energy to accomplish this was supposed
to come from the power plant.

Now I personally know that if a reactionless thruster produces any more
thrust per kW than a laser, then it is inherently non-conservational.  The
same with contragravity of any kind.

Perhaps because the thrust vectoring systems can fail.

Perhaps because the thrust vectoring systems don\'t work that way in
atmosphere (the ships you are looking at are streamlined)

Perhaps because it protects them from enemy fire (the weapons and heaviest
armor in front, drives and other important systems in back)

IMC, the Third Imperium has as much or more of a prejudice against

Given current trends and likely developments in molecular biology,
pharmacology, and chemical engineering, tailor-made synthetics will
dominate, in my opinion.

N.B. : \'synthetic\' equals production by modified organisms (metabolic or
gene level - hormone modulators, gene therapy etc.), artificial
factories (cell culture, protein machines, nanites), and purpose built
substances.

This is not to underestimate the value of ethnopharmacology, etc.
I just feel that combinatorial chemistry will be a more efficient
(unfortunately not conducive to adventuring in exotic locales)
solution to the problem.

Alternative med in space is a cool idea ; but at average stellar+
tech levels, it isn\'t necessary.

(IMTU) That depends on tech level. finding & duplicating means extracting
the effective substance from the plant (or others), while synthezising
these and specially designed ones needs some more advancemant in
biochemistry.

In Chemistry History the isolation came before analyzing and before
synthesizing. Chlorophyll is a good example for this.

Makes good for an adventure once. I thought about letting my group catch a
virus on downport, becoming active when they\'re half through jump space.
The disease is not yet deadly, but the ill ones get soon disabled to work.
Now the problems they\'ve got are:
 
What to do with panicking passengers?
What about the quarantine?
Who will be the next one to become ill?
Who will land the ship, if the pilot gets ill? 
and is a doctor aboard, to find a medicine?

Anyone played such an adventure before?

On doctors v lawyers :-

Two hundred plus years later, the lawyers have filled the leeches\'
ecological niche.
Doctors are waiting for the next class action or product liability
suit to further limit what they can do for their patients.

Phonons are low-frequent oscillations aof the atoms that go through a
crystal. They are coupled vibrations of all atoms of this crystal, so
the phonons can wander through it.

My only contacts with this theme comes from theoretical chemistry, in
which the normal oscillations of molecules and crystals be calulated 
and viewed.

I\'d guess, that \'ronons\' stem from rotational motion as \'phonons\' come
from the vibrational. But I do not know.

It\'d be easier trying to mine iron from the Earth\'s core. It\'s tens to
*hundreds* of thousands of km to that ice.

It\'s *much* simpler to mine commets and moons.

We worked out the rules for a "thruster" that worked by pushing on
another body (such as a planet). It didn\'t break any laws, but the
power requirements quickly got nasty. Or with a constant power input,
the acceleration dropped rapidly.

Alas, the acids rapidly react with metallic ions to form nitrates.
Nitrates are *very* soluble. In fact *no* nitrate is insoluble. So all
the nitrates would wind up in solution. Which tends to result in water
containing *lots* of metal ions.

Ammonia forms the ammonium ion in water. Which freely decomposes into
free ammonia, and a hydrogen ion. Ammonium compounds tend to be rare
for this reason.

So as with nitrates, it\'s very unlikely that you\'d get mineral deposits
in corporating ammonium compounds.

BTW, ammonia water mixtures will give *really* weird weather because of
the complex phase diagrams involved.

Sulfates do form mineral deposits, but sulfides are a lot more common.
Sulfur is almost as active as oxygen at mineral forming temperatures. 

Sulfur compounds also form the basis of the ecology of deep ocean vents
and deep rock bacteria.

Which is why ballots in Oregon have the order shuffled around. If
everyone voted for the first person on their ballot, the votes would be

Could you name these cultures? And sorry, but the Book of Mormon does
*not* count as a reference.

The problem is that gold is too flimsy. You can\'t use gold foil, you
have to use plates. Which makes things bulkier.

Why? It doesn\'t *have* to be inverse square based. It could be the

Nope! If you check, you will find that gravity and electrostatic forces
do *not* act that way. Really! Virtual particles do things real
particles can\'t.

For example, if such a lag existed in gravity, planetary orbits would
be really weird. This is sometimes claimed to be a violation of
relativity, but apparently isn\'t (I\'ve seen the arguments on
rec.arts.sf.science far too many times).

We worked out the formulas for speed, acceleration, and time as a
function of distance (given a steady power input). They\'re pretty sad. :-)

How?

It becomes something we don\'t know how to do. But that doesn\'t mean it
violates physics.

That\'s assuming that a single planet has the population required to
"invent" TL25.

What I\'m thinking of is the fact that inspirations of a given "level"
seem to be proportional to size of the "intellectual population". Thus
the larger the "community" of scientists/engineers/innovators who are
able to exchange idea, the more likely you are to get an advance. 

But the farther you go, the larger the required community is *or* the
more slowly the advances come. Thus there ought to be a TL at which the
odds of a single planet being able to make to jump to the next level
become too low for it to be a likely occurence.

The frame you describe is *not* an inertial frame. It\'s an accelerated
one. So you need a different frame. Probably one in which the impulse
given to the planet and to the ship are equal and opposite. In *that*
frame, energy should wind up being conserved.

Phonons have to do with "vibration". Sort of. I don\'t fully understand
it, but they have to do with some wave phenomena.

> BTW, what\'s a quantum fluid?

It\'s a fluid composed of particles whose interaction is dominated by
quantum effects as opposed to molecular or atomic forces. Helium 2 is a
"state" of liquid helium (helium 4, not helium 3) where it has become a
superfluid. It\'s a quantum fluid of sorts. 

You also get a quite *different* sort of quatum fluid in the core of a
neutron star. 

But I\'m getting *way* out of my depth here.

Those are not engines, they\'re cooling vents. The eject superheated
hydrogen to cool off the ship (this is the blue glow seen in Star Wars and
other documentary starship films). If they were mounted on the front the
delicate sensor surfaces of ship sensors would be plated with superheated
hydrogen when the ship accelerates. Bruces notes about reducing your IR sig

So pick the right route and it is "easy" to get across the great rift.

To cross the Great Rift from the main part of the Imperium to the
Spinward Marches the easiest route will take you across the rimward edge
of Corridor Sector using the following optimum route.

You will preferably need a Jump 6 ship with fuel purification.

Take the following route

From Capitol of other start point take the shortest Jump 6 route to 

Jafla/Corridor 1840	A 898114-E

you need to make Jump 7 to get to the next planet

Tristara/Corridor 1140	C 870740-5

Options

1) Use a ship with enough fuel for Jump 6 + an additional Jump 1 (or
more).  Possbile with MT or TNE rules, but nearly impossible with other
rules.

2) Transport your ship in a really big transport with Jump 1 drives &
enough fuel for 2 Jump 1\'s.  It will be able to transport another ship
of about half its tonnage as cargo.

3) Use jump tanks 

4) Assume that the Imperium does this all the time & use the secret
Imperial Naval calibration point set up to make this easy.  (It would be
best if you had the Navys permisiion & knew where the Calibration point
is or you\'ll be SOL.

from Tristara go to

Esi-Obe/Corridor 0638	A 542886-C	a Jump 5 from Esi-Obe go to
Ishirdu/Corridor 0338	X 776301-0	a Jump 3 from Ishirdu go to

According to DPG library data Ishirdu is Red zoned because its native
sentients are psionic.  It seems like quite a bit of effort to maintanin
a Red Zone in the middle of the rift.  Only the planet is interdicted so
you can refuel at the gas giant. (Early Adventures, Library Data, DGP)

Lorin Antune/Deneb 2734 D 525867-3	this will require a jump 8 so you
will need to use one of method 1,2, or 4 listed above (you can\'t use
option 3, drop tanks, because you can\'t get drop tanks at Ishirdu).

This area is the best point for the Imperial Navy to have a Naval
Calibration Point.  They can use the excuse that they need it to supply
the interdiction fleet at Ishirdu but it is really there to control the
most viable route across the rift.  In the campaign I played in the
Calibration point was in Deneb 3035 a Jump 5 from Ishirdu making the
route J5 capable, especially if their is another calbration point in or
near Corridor 1340 making that part of the route J5 as well.

from Lorin Atune go to

Javan/Deneb 3035 C77A135-A 	a Jump 6 from Javan.

Congratulations you have just crossed the Great Rift.  For "canonical"
information on the locations of TNE era (year 1202) Calibration points
for this area see Regency SB pg 63.

After the ship she was chief engineer of used this route (which she
plotted) to cross the Great Rift a charecter of mine went to a tshirt
shop on their next stop, Alaunpaya (Deneb 1628 C 140794-8), and had
tshirts made up for the crew that said:

"My starship crossed the Great Rift the hard way and all I got was this
lousy T Shirt"

I got a strange look from the GM when I told him what I was doing....

Ship has some arbitrary momentum, p = mv
and energy (kinetic + gravitational potential :
(0.5 X m X v^2) + mgh).

Ship uses thrusters :-
Let thrust energy = E.
Planet gains momentum, p1 and kinetic energy k1
Ship gains momentum and kinetic energy.
Momentum = (m - dm) X (v+dv), dm mass of fuel consumed,
dv velocity change.
Kinetic energy = [0.5 X (m-dm) X (v+dv)^2] + (m-dm)g(h+dh),
dh change in altitude or distance from planet.

Test : Is momentum or energy conserved?

momentum : mv not equal to [(m-dm)X(v+dv)] - p1 ?

energy : does (0.5 X m X v^2) + mgh + E equal
[0.5 X (m-dm) X (v+dv)^2] + (m-dm)g(h+dh) + k1 ?

My understanding is that this is an abstraction designed to make building
the ships easier, and that the part of the power plant associated with the
weapon is not actually IN the turret, but becomes extra power plant volume,
mass etc, thus making the plant bigger. Admittedly, the system as written
does cause problems for ship mapping etc.

I also thought there were a bunch o\' meson bay weapons.  Perhaps that was
one of the later variations?

Those Meson bay weapons would do serious things to smaller escorts under
Megatraveller, generally in the form of critical hits.

They are also an excellent ortillery tool.  Oh, and in combat against other
"capital" ships (wouldn\'t take it up against anything much bigger...except
in numbers) remember to use the "internal" damage table under MT and
CT/HG...leads to a quicker conclusion.

I\'m suprised those 50 and 100 ton meson bays weren\'t incorporated into more
designs.  Instead I seem to recall a lot of (ptew!) fusion gun bays.
Useless.

  I call foul. You mentioned the forbidden one     :-)

I\'d say a sensible limit on disads is to make all subject to GM approval, and
no high point disads which mean the entire group have to suffer because one
player wanted a 20 point disadvantage he would never have to face alone, as he
knew the whole group would have to suffer with him.

IIRC, there has been 1 machine race...the Sabmiqys (sp?) in the Antares
sector. Now they are planetbound, being rather space-phobic (for historical
reasons).

The Sabmiqys are currently interdicted red-zone by the IISS, because of the
high TL (17) and some contact problems. There was a write up about them, in
Challenge, I think.

IMTU there is a government/society that is heavily involved with
robotics/AI...they have done just this. Most fighters, SDBs, and small ships
(Destroyers, Escorts) are actually Drones. Only the larger ships, which need
a lot more active maintenance, have sophont crew - and these have much less
than an Imperial vessel.

Easier answers.

5)  Jump 3 with the drop tanks attached then jump 4.  The mass of the jump
tanks empty will be much less and mak this posible.  Or us external tanks
made to be disassembled and stored internally.  Use them later for the
second long jump.

6) Jump 2 with a fuel ship.  Refuel and continue alone.  The fuel ship jumps
back.  Use stored calapsable drop tanks for the second long jump.

7) Jump 2 with drop tanks.  Drop the tanks full.  Jump back to refuel.  Jump
to the drop tanks.  Refuel and jump carrying the drop tanks.  Later drop
them in the other long jump.

8) Fly a battle tender and lose 60% of your remaining mass each jump 6.

9) Use a jump tug and carry fuel pods.  Lose 60% of your remaining mass each
jump 6.

I have independently decided that they offer +50% and +100% hit points,
respectively, and they represent not only toughening up the bulkheads but
also redundant cabling and armor on critical systems.

Meson bays have a pretty large power requirement, and are pretty
easy to stop with even smaller meson screens. And remember,
if you have a Meson spinal mount HG didn\'t let you have Meson
bays. The ship profile only had one digit available for each kind of
weapon\'s  battery factor, you couldn\'t have any kind of weapon with
differing factors for different batteries.

IIRC, there are some power & price advantages to fusion bays over
10-turret dual fusion gun turrets - but I\'ll have to check my copy of HG.

Sure...you use a \'stage\' theory like modern rockets.  Unfortunately, the
scaling required is horrible -- you halve your available tonnage roughly
every
4-5 parsecs, which means you need something like a million-ton base craft
to
get a scout across the rift.  If you have drop tanks it\'s somewhat easier,
halving around every 8 parsecs.  Filling tanks with liquid methane and then
processing it after jump gives you another 50% or so.  Still not exactly
practical unless you can find a star in the middle.

Well, isn\'t that one of the two options I mentioned to begin with?
"Around TL 10 you hit some sort of \'wall\' that slows down technological
developement considerably". With your explanation a society will reach
a wall once its technological developement reach a bit further than we
have on Earth today (Earth has a population level of 9; individual planets
don\'t get much higher than that, and many of the planets in Milieu 0 had
population level 10. So the technological developement in Charted Space
- --  not just the Imperium, but all of Charted Space  --  of the last 1100
years is presumably representative of the "natural" rate of advance. Old
Darrian is still a freak, but it will be that anyway.

Well, the best way to get away with this is never let the victim know you\'re
there...taking out the SDB is _going_ to raise a ruckus, as _some_ crewmember
will get an alarm out. I\'d think you won\'t get away with this more often than
once a _year_ or so. No problem, just wait \'till there\'s a lucrative enough
cargo passing though, whihc means you have to finance a good, _long_ term
source of intelligence, whihc almost certainly means someone on the Port
Authority of the worlds you are contemplating hitting.

But it\'s workable...just remember, no matter how professional or paramilitary
you are, you _still have to say "Arrrr!" a lot and have a stuffed parrot sewn
to the shoulder of your vacc suit, or you just can\'t call yourself pirates.

A far mor lucrative way of stealing cargoes, btw, is to do it the way Gotti
did...don\'t rob the ship, rob the warehouses, particularly the _customs_
warehouses. Load the goods on your ship and leave like any other ordinary
commercial flight. This again requires considerable inside information.
Customs warehouses are good in that they\'re already nicely sealed. If you can
get in without raising an alarm, someone\'s less likely to come in and surprise you.

I might get flamed for this, but my response to  Phil\'s  question
is "so what?"  Surely a  \'good\'  society  is  one  in  which  its
citizens are able to explore their potential as human beings  (or
whatever) ... in whatever field of endevour that may be.

For player characters (at least) in the Third  Imperium  this  is
certainly true: the PCs can be traders  or  merchant  princes,  a
mercenary unit, a "Magnificent Seven" group righting wrongs, they
can leave the Third Imperium  and  carve  out  their  own  pocket
empire and run it according  to  the  values  and  ideals  _they_
believe in ... What can\'t they do?  For the vast majority of NPCs
you\'d have to look at each world within the Third Imperium  on  a
case-by-case basis.

Democracy is a _tool_ to build good societies.  It is unimportant
_in itself_, but it is important for what it _can_ do.  There are
many examples of bad democracies, why is it so  hard  to  believe
there can be good non-democracies.

I suspect that, like many things in  life,  democracy  isn\'t  the
"best" but the "least worst".

I\'ve heard it said that democracy guarantees that people get what
they deserve.  This is based on a false premis that the people in
a democracy are fairly homogeneous.  Who here believes  that  the
German Jews got what they deserved when the  majority  of  German
citizens voted in Adolf Hitler before WW2?  Not me.

Democracies seem to degenerate into \'mobocracies\'  where  mildly-
corrupt leaders maintain their power by pandering to  the  lowest
common  denominators.  Laws  tend  to  become  counter-productive
quick-fix solutions that are petty and intollerant, and sometimes
contradict a society\'s founding principles.

To summarise:
- - Do I think Traveller has anti-decratic trends?
- - Yup

- - Do I find this disturbing?
- - No.  Refreshing.

Ahem. Sorry \'bout that!

Actually, the engines are in the rear because like Khan only thinking in 2
dimensions, we terrans only think in terms of moving through a resistive
environment such as water or air in a gravity field. With such designs the
thrust agencies are best put in the front or rear of a long skinny hull form
with deck facings perpendicular to the direction of thrust. They\'re almost
_always_ at the very front or rear because a) that frees up more contiguous
volume inside the hull for everything else, and b) there\'s much less loss of
power due to a longer transmission train.

The design carries over to Traveller ships because a) humans are creatures of
habit and b) many of these vessels _are_ designed to operate in air and water
(in the presence of gravity fields) themselves. Finally, most illustrations od
Traveller starships also show some sort of \'stuff\' coming out the back...canon
says there\'s a blue glow to thruster plates when they\'re working. This lends
credence to the \'They\'re tossing out neutrinos\' crown of how \'reactionless\'
thrusters work, and you don\'t want to have bathe half of your ship and cargo
in an insanely high flux of neutrinos at any given time.

Ronons are phonons who\'s liege-lord has been killed, and are forced to

THAT was the SW-ish idea!  Instead of throwing 2D+7 (for a skill 2, Dex-7
character), we take the stat off the target number and just throw the dice.

It\'s a little easier to play that way.  We\'re subtracting stat from the
target number rather than adding stat to the throw.

It\'s the same idea, though.  You must not have read it completely.

Yes, I\'ve seen a few things about T5 that have really turned me off.  As a
result, I haven\'t played Traveller in over a year.  We\'ve started this SW
campaign (as you know), and I don\'t think we\'re going back...

...not unless T5 can compare with the quality in products and game
mechanics that WEG puts out.  My gaming buck is just better spent there,
and when I buy a SW supplement, I feel good about it, as opposed to being
disappointed, like I have been with too many Traveller items.

I love the Traveller universe, but it seems the rest of the game--the
mechanics and such, which are very important to me--does not compare to
other game company\'s output.

Yes, see the difference between you and me is that I\'ll go with another
game--buy their products instead of suffering through "mining" this and
"adapting" that.

It\'s just too much work.  I don\'t have time for it anymore.


>  So, Ken, how\'s the movie going?

Exceptionally well.  I\'ve just started the third draft, which I should have
completed by the end of December.  We go into full gear raising funds in
January.  Shortly after that, we\'ll go into preproduction, gathering a
crew, assembling actors, etc.  Then we\'ll shoot.  This will take us about 3
weeks.  Next is post, and we\'ll be done.

We\'re looking to get into Sundance.  This thing has really grown in the
year that I\'ve been working on it.  I believe it\'s going to pay off.

I started off with the idea that we\'d do this guerilla style, with me
holding the camera and such.  But, it\'s grown into a full-bore production.
I\'ll be hiring a DOP (director or photography), a sound man, and other crew
members.  We\'re still not talking a multi-million dollar epic, but my
budget has grown from five digits to six.

One it started rolling, and people could see that I was really doing it,
support started to flood in.  With what I\'ve got lined up, I don\'t think
raising money is going to be that hard, or take that much time--which is
unusual for a low budget independent flick.

I\'ll keep you guys posted.

Kenneth.

Yeah, but the model the artist used is rather attractive none the less.  At

The average subsector has one Imperial fleet with an average of 62.5 capital
ships (cruisers and battleships) and an unspecified number of auxiliary
vessels[*], a subsector fleet of roughly comparable size (exact size will
depend on the actual size and TL of the subsector population), and an
unspecified number of local defense forces. What sort of commerce raiding do
you suppose will nessecitate drawing forces from the neighboring interior
subsectors? What sort will nessecitate drawing forces from other borders?

The Imperium has a history of dealing harshly with foreign governments caught
supporting pirates (a canonical example is Tarkine in District 268). The
Zhodani are big enough to provide sanctuary; the Sword Worlds may be (but I
doubt it); no one else is.

So now you add running expenses for your pirate organisation for six months.

You can have your perfect information and you can have it six months in
advance. That\'s not what I was talking about. How do you intercept the
specific ship? If it is scheduled to deliver before Day 187 then it will
have to aim for arriving on day 186 in order to account for possible jump
delay. That means you have to be there on day 185 (just in case your target
jumps early). That means you have to aim for Day 184 and risks arriving on
Day 183. Say you do arrive on Day 184 (the most likely outcome) and the
ship arrives on Day 186 (again the most likely outcome). What did you do
in those 48 hours and what did the local system defenses think of that?

Next, do you play with jumps being controllable to arriving at a specific
point at the 100 diameter limit or do you believe ships arrive at a random
point on the 100-diameter shell? In either case how do you arrange to be
at the same spot as the arriving ship but without some pesky SDB being
there too?

That might work. If the company dosen\'t have the smarts to let the captain
chose his own route, of course. And if the captain is unable to avoid
systems with no defense forces, which would be rare also.

How much does it cost to build two cruisers? A single load of computer

The Kforuzeng was going to pay MCr500 for those two meson guns. And they
failed to get them, btw.

The hardware and operational parameters for a legitimate merchant and a
pirate is miles apart. A pirate might be able to masquerade as a merchant
(depends on the transponder issue, of course ;-), but IMO there\'s no way
he can make a living as one.

The SDB is propably bought with a bank loan. That means that the cost of
operating it is less than the bank payments and the savings from putting
it in ordinary a lot less. Especially if it means buying a less capable
ship to perform customs inspection and search&rescue. Also (but this is
just IMTU) the Imperium requires its individual worlds to assume some of
the burden of defense.

I include such ships in what I mean when I say system defenses.

Well, that\'s what I believe some the subsector fleet\'s auxiliary vessels

For covering worlds unable to support ships of their own, jump-capable ships
are propably a better bet than boats.

No, and the next pirate I use in my campaign is going to be a mutiny ship.
But how often does that happen? And why should they turn to piracy? Don\'t 
tell me, it\'s a rethorical question; we went over that the last time piracy
was debated: You can\'t sell illegally acquired ships. But if you assume
that, then you also assume that the pirate can\'t sell captured ships. And
if they can\'t sell captured ships, they have to contend themselves with
random cargoes. And random cargoes does not appear to be valuable enough
to support a pirate ship.

Privateers aren\'t state supported. They have to meet the bottom line. And
besides, they only work in wartime.

The Vikings didn\'t need to present their ship\'s papers to the port captain
every time they arrived at a new port. We\'ve been through all these facile
explanations before and they all suffer from the same thing: They each
contain some unspoken assumptions that dosen\'t hold up upon examination.
The last time (and the time before) this discussion came up, I asked a
pirate proponent to present me with a detailed description of a successful
pirate foray, complete with the underlying economics and odds of finding
and capturing suitable prey. So far no one has done so.

If you can, yes. It\'s not as easy as you claim. Nor is it the kind of piracy

And how much is that? IMO the Imperium requires its planets to spend a
certain percentage of its production on its military.

For a typical 400 T corsair that\'s one too many.

But the pirates portrayed in the CT sources are the small-fry kind. They
lurk around in backwater systems and try to capture Free Traders.

Pirates have to be where their prey is, which happens to be where the
system defenses are too.

Every time a pirate has a brush with a military vessel, he risks getting hit
and take damage that will cost megacredits to repair. In a war of attrition
a planetary population is apt to have deeper pocket than a pirate.

Actually, a GURPS fusion power plant has a startup mass of 1 ton (+1 ton per 10
megawatts) so it makes a significant difference in weight and cost to have a
separate power plant rather than tieing it in to the existing power plant.

If this weren\'t true, I\'d agree that you could just install an aux power plant.

Actually, they do.  _Changes_ in fields propagate at lightspeed -- it appears

Reread those TNS articles...they clearly state that the drop tank

Oh, reeaally... very interesting.

Does anyone else have any information on these Sabmiqys? Hex location in
Antares, Challenge issue #, or anything else?

For those of you familiar with GURPS, how do you think the 3I would react
to a GURPS Reign of Steel-type world. I\'m thinking red zone and orbital
saturation bombing ...

This is actually a setting I was thinking about running. A TNE-style Long
Night setting after the 3I\'s Hard Times collapse (no Virus, as written).
However, there is this *one* world where AIs take over (a la GURPS Reign of
Steel). Perhaps the PCs are misjumped explorers for an emerging pocket
empire. Or if I\'m feeling cruel, perhaps they are natives of the world...

62.5?  Where did you get that number?  And were is the economy to pay for
the support for that level of militerisation?  Good lord!  That\'s a capital
ship and change per habital system on the average!  Do you mean secter?
That would be a little more reasonable.  The ratio of capital to non capital
ships should be around 4 to one or more.  That\'s 248 jump capable destroyers
or whatever.  Or ruffly 1000 capital ships and 4000 destroyers in the
Spinward marches sector alone!  It also does not sound reasonable based on
the TNS reports of the frontier wars.  No where near that number of ships
were discussed.  Where and when are these figures derived from?

If you have the flight plan you know where to wait for them.  As for the
SDBs, you jump in behind some terrain feature like the star and move to your
attack position.  With comerse raiding chewing up the local defences is a
plus.  If you want to keep them near to home launch a spread of missiles at
the population centers of the planet.  They will be far to busy saying their
employers you worry about you.

How is that?  They both require large amounts of cargo space.  As for paying
remember that the cargo in a ship must be valuable enough to be able to
absorb the cost of shiping which is 2000cr per ton per parsec.  That cargo
must be worth some money to be able to absorb that kind of overhead.

The cost is pure cost as a SDB produces no income.  How could a SDB produce
income?  Military ships are pure expence>  You only return is a measure of
security.  As for a \'less capable ship\', a large armored cargo ship that is
heavily armed would be a better deal for any system with more than one
habital planet or with asteroid mines.  The patrol craft could earn it\'s
keep as a bulk in-system cargo transport while patroling.

That depends graetly on the planet and the pirates.  If they are war time
comerse raider that may not be true and the SDBs will have to stay close to
the planet to defend against misile attacks on planetary targets.

Again my senerio was a war time one.

Yes, or as has been mentioned before, rob the trucks on the way to the
starport. At least you don\'t put your own ship at risk of destruction in
the theft attempt (although getting the hijacked cargo to your own ship is
another fine thing).

  I\'ll bite - doesn\'t the Emperor have to work through a bureaucracy and/

  Keep in mind that a single 400 Dt SDB of a given TL will typically make
an uneconomical mess of a 1000 Dt para-military starship of the same TL,
at least under HG. FWIW, the SDB will have the higher speed and Agility,
so disengaging will not likely be the pirates\' option, except perhaps by
Jump (and they\'ll need a big power surplus to enjoy trying that).

Why?

If there is not a war being fought in the vicinity, do you really think that
they would spend more money on something as parasitic as a "standing army"
than they feel they have to?  If they are getting a large number of cargos
transiting thier space, it seems possible that the "bean counters" mindset
will take over...it\'s cheaper to lose a few cargos here and there than spend
ungodly amounts of money to drive it off.  Remember, no pirates (or raiders,
or privateers; choose your own term for it) means that you have a high-cost
force doing absolutely nothing but being.  I can\'t see govt doing this
willingly (the old Stealth Bomber debate...lets get rid of them cuz the target
country no longer is a threat)

And on the subject of money...

It seems to me that all the financial arguements are debated based on the TCS
and IS  figures.  Now, I personally believe that TCS was perhaps the best CT
adventure put out;  but the figures are at best suspect to me.  Sure, a world
w/ 10 billion people will have 10 times the money that a world w/ 1
billion...but this reminds me of the last pirate debate:  using these
assumptions,  the United States should have a cop on every corner.  How
realistic is this?

IMTU, I take a figure of MCr100 per year for a MILITARY budget...this is
divided between the Imperial Navy (50%), the subsector/reserve Navy (30%) and
local defense (20%)  50Cr per person/year seems to give more realism for me
and mine.

What are your records from? I\'ve only Galacticv2.4 program, and i don\'t know where are
the names that appear there taken from, but i expect that it isn\'t complete.

Actually, Rolnam is a name i\'ve put to that sector, i didn\'t know it was already named.
Do you know anything else about it? Is it really inhabited by K\'kree?

To have a common ground of argument, we need to be using the same setting. :-)

Certainly these are the figures for YTU, and they probably work very well
in your version of the 3I. However, for debate\'s sake we are using the only
common reference that is available to us, which happens to be the printed
"canon" (in this case, TCS and IS).

I don\'t think anyone here is saying "Pirates in every variation of the
Traveller game setting are stupid." Rather, the argument is that given the
printed information we are presented of the "official" 3rd Imperium, piracy
makes little sense as a career -- and definitely makes no sense at all at
the frequency implied by the random ship encounter tables.

Basically, we\'re arguing for fun. :-)

Yes. There was an interview with the Director Peter Jackson on TV the other
week. Apparently he\'s signed a contract for a series of three movies, one
for each of the three volumes Lord of the Rings was published in.

First, there needs to be some kind of fuel source in the system, either as
water on the mainworld or as ice asteroids. Second, the world is probably
*very* dominated by it\'s shipyard, since both navy and scout bases are
present, the port is class A and the population is 900. I would say that
the atmosphere is tainted because of this heavy industry alone.

Either way, the place smells of military... why not have the navy accuse
the poor PCs of spying on the base ?

They get in the way of windows (a lot of people like to be
able to see the direct they are going).  Some streamlined
ships are fatter in the rear, which makes for more space
for them.  A few other reasons.  You could put them in front
if you wanted to but I\'m not sure why....

ObTrav: Thinking of the K\'kree and other border states, what are your views
of the galaxy beyond Known Space. What lay outside the 2,000 Worlds, or the
Zhodani Consulate? How far did the Ancients explore into the beyond?

Oh, and how much are the new GT Aliens books going to trash our view of
those races covered in the old DGP books? (I look forward to these books,
really.)

They might not, but then again the AIs might see life as intelligence & the
loss of 1 intelligent being vs the loss of 1,000 of the same is a better
viewpoint...

On a large ship, with a crew of say 1,000 men & women, the crew quarters
are 54,000 m^3 (from MT), so all that space can have more fuel, more
computers, bigger drives, more armor...  Making a 50K dT ship with Jump
Drive equal to a Battle Rider crewed by humans...

OTH, you do have the Berserker(sp) problem....

Makes sense to me...  To think in 5700 AD computers are of the level of the
1970s makes me sick...  I just run it as the full crew is for three shifts
& you can get along with a third of the needed crew...

Y\'know, this brings up an interesting point...

On a world like this, where there is probably a single point of
habitation, the \'tainted\' atmosphere could well be localized to that
single point of habitation. Around the starport facilities it could be
like LA on a bad day, or worse, Mexico City on a good one ;-) but the
rest of the place might have a decent atmosphere...This could solve the
problem of \'taint of the week\' when dealing with many of the UWP\'s in
Traveller. Few of the planets may actually have an endemic taint, but a
localized one around the centers of population.

For places with pop B or A, it might get hard finding someplace that
_isn\'t_ bad, but look at earth...Pop 9 but there\'s lots pf places with
nice clean air, and lots of places that are awful, even hazardous if
breathed. (Like our offices today...they\'re re-roofing the building, and
the place stinks of hydrocarbons...)

Well, some people like to experience the rush of superheated plasma and
radiation that their thrusters put out.  :-)

Seriously though, for safety reasons, any exhaust from the ship needs to be
directed away from the living quarters and preferably away from the rest of the
ship in general.  If your ship does not have an exhaust plume (be it  plasma or
neutrinos) then it doesn\'t really matter where the thruster is.  An example
would be some sort of maglev vessel that flies along magnetic fields.  I\'m not
entirely sure that jump drives need to be in the rear, but if you\'ve got your
maneuver drives back there, you may as well save your engineers the walk and
put the jump drives in the engineering section as well.

The next factor is keeping your vessel going in a straight line.  That means
that the thrust vector has to pass through the center mass of the vehicle.
Generally, people like to put this on the opposite side of the engines from
their exhaust nozzle.  One method of putting the engine up front is a funnel
shape.  You can put your quarters in a ring around the exhaust jet far enough
away that you don\'t get burned.  This just seems cost ineffective.

IMO this would apply no matter what form of government it had. 

It just occured to me that while it has been noted that historically
democracies don\'t last very long nobody has commented on the 3I\'s unusual
longevity and stability as a feudal state or as a secular empire.

I find it curious that the 3I, which uses a form of government that I find
similar to both the bureaucratic empires of China, with some Roman and Holy
Roman Empire style nobles thrown in was so stable (two civil wars in its
1100 year existence, and no meaningful revolts after the first few hundred
years). In all these empires dynasties changed through civil war rather
more often than not. What\'s more the Holy Roman Empire suffered from
constant fricton between its rulers and its bureaucrats (the church) over
division of power, with the nobles taking sides for reasons mainly grounded
in expedience.

Why was the 3I so stable? As its naval strength in canon seems to be tiny
compared to what it could afford it wasn\'t through terrorising it\'s people.
IMO it was because most worlds were happy with the deal they got - safe
trade and low taxes in exchange for not being allowed to conquer other
planets or keep slaves. While civil wars on member worlds don\'t seem to
have been uncommon, nor do they seem to have been rife, so it would seem
that most people were also happy with their world government.

I have come to suspect that a lot of the repression and corruption seen in
various publications is only visible to Travellers (which IMTU constitute a
unique and fairly indentifible group that include Imperial nobles). IOW
only those who interact directly with the Imperium or move in Imperial
juristiction (ie deep space) had any chance of noticing the problems in the
Imperial system. Of course this group includes the PCs, just about all
their potential patrons, and anybody with any influence in the Imperium, so
while while the average citizen blindly goes about his business the Evil
Empire is busy corrupting its life blood and turning its brightest stars
into rebels. This sounds more like Dark Conspiracy than anything else...hmmm.

Just some thoughts.

I always thought this was just an excuse to both stop other people using
the route, and to get funding for a permanent in-rift presence. It wouldn\'t
surprise me to find that the natives weren\'t psionic at all. Mind you it
wouldn\'t surprise me to find that they were and were being used for secret
Navy experiments either.

IMO this will only work if it\'s related to TL+1 or TL+2, because according
to Bruce Johnson\'s post the total population of the 3I is 5.55E13, giving a
cap of TL13 or TL14. It also doesn\'t explain why the Solomani and Zhodani
seem to be limited to TL14. The Solomani might be explainable by them
having just gone through a war, but the 3I reached Tl15 during the war, and
it was also tired after this war but still managed to disseminate the new
technology (or have more planets raise their TL). Maybe the Zho\'s were
limited by their stable form of government, but then how come the 3I, also
very stable, managed to get ahead? If stability comes at the expense of
advancement (as it did for the Vilani) surely the Solomani, who have the
least settled history (joining and unjoining from the Imperium, and having
a very competitive set of member states) should have come out ahead?

The Solomani could too, but I don\'t think they\'d gain much from it, as
they\'re the only nation on that border.

It\'s worse than that - if you use MT, TNE or T4 (and I think CT, as well)
the 100 diameter limit is inside detection range of the planet or ships in
orbit, and for a size A world you\'ll be in gunnery range of a 6G SDB in
about 3 hours if it starts in orbit. If there are 4-8 SDBs out at about 60
diameters and even spaced any ship on the 100 diameter limit would be in
gun range pretty much instantly. I personally think that if you have the
money Battle Riders make wonderful SDBs (high acceleration, good endurance,
good sensors, tough and have huge guns - what more could you want?), and
most worlds can afford at least a few.

I suppose this puts me in the
\'piracy-simply-isn\'t-feasible-if-there-is-any-defence-at-all\' group, even
though I accept it as canon, and it exists IMTU. However IMTU it\'s almost
always really privateers or Vargr in the CT period. In MT IMO you have a
much better chance of getting away with piracy because there\'ll be systems
with no defence. Mind you there\'s also the chance of accidentally jumping
into a system chock-full of some faction or another\'s latest \'surprise
attack\' or \'final assault\'.

You can still get it; I have it.  It was available for free, not
as "registerable" shareware.  However: It seems not fully
functional under Win95; the subsector map doesn\'t work properly.
I suspect that it\'s an issue of TravNav being a 16-bit WinApp
that wasn\'t quite coded in full conformance with the WinAPI spec
so that it would work in the 32-bit world of 95/NT.

Send me an e-mail address.  When/if I get my ISP problems fully
straightened out, I\'ll add it to the Freelance Traveller Computer
Connection as well.

You know Anders, that\'s not a bad idea. It explains where all that
hydrogen fuel goes...that the GURPS people say our fusion engines
shouldn\'t be using..we don\'t burn it, we vent it as coolant. And it does
make sense that the main venting ports would along the ship\'s stern. 
Knock out a ship\'s coolant vents or hole it\'s coolant supply and it has
to cut power or fry.

I realize I\'m not too StarWars literate, but I just assumed Princess Leia was
the princess of one particular planet, and each planet sent a representative
to the Old Republic.  Perhaps she was the representative (the original movie
could be interpreted that way, if she was on the way home from a meeting with
the other remnants of the republic).

Sure. If you have a big daddy (the Imperium) to protect you, not to
mention all that money on the sector navy, why bother with all those SDB
wings? Example: Canada, with about 1.3% GDP to the military compared to
4% in the US. Moreover, you\'ll see priorities based  partly on planetary
prestige. Example: Canada (for a long time) dedicated the majority of its
military budget to support of NATO forces in Germany and to ASW to
protect the atlantic convoys to reinforce them, not to SDB equivelents
like coastal defense submarines or continental air defense squadrons.
The Trav equivelent of this is a small power deciding to put its budget
into some CruRons and Housecarl or spacelift capable planetary army units
that can go fight the Zhodani on their home turf, or at least, be part of
the colonial/subsector forces and involved in "forward defense." This
is the big prestige, big ticket item for a general\'s career perspective.
Moreover, it also makes some political sense. Sure, people might want
"troops at home" but it gives you more say in where that fleet will be,
and it also means you can hopefully stop that Zho or Vargr fleet on the
border instead of waiting for it to arrive in your system....

A third of the canon 3% of GDP in military expenditure going to the
Imperium, and the Imperium spending 70% of it\'s funds on the Navy, and
ships costing 10% of their build cost in maintainence per year.

Figure out what 1% of, say, Mora\'s tax receipts are.

It\'s an unfortunate fact of life, but a lot of canon got written by people
who couldnt count up tax receipts. Big fleets are a neccessary concequence
of big planetary populations - 30 billion people create a lot of tax revenue.

The other point to remember is the rich worlds are going to tend to own the
banks that own the mortgages on the Free Traders that get pirated. So even
if the piracy occours on poor iceballs, it still has ripple effects to the
important worlds.

The Zho\'s are the only people near the Marches. The Vargr arent a state per
se ... you may also want to get a history book and look up the War of
Jenkins\' Ear to see what a minor incident can do to spark a shooting war
when tension already exists.

A Hi Pop world, by definition, has a billion people. Two credits each, per
annum, in SDB taxes turns into more SDBs than I want to count. Even if they
are shiny new imported SDBs that need 20% their sticker cost in imported
spare parts per year, it\'s still more SDBs than I want to count.

>You have many informants and move form job to job as opertunity knocks.

Give us some numbers on how much an informant costs, and how often they
come up with information. From my memories of Chopper Read\'s books,
informants got 10% of the take from an armed robbery in Sydney in the 80s.

You also have the time lags in getting the messages from the informants to
the secret pirate base (or Gvorrdun Commonality, or whatever).

By the way, earlier in the Piracy debate, I proposed bits of the Imperial
Intelligence structure arrange for the news that so and so might be able to
be got at, just to see which dogs bark in response.

OK. So you are cruising from the star to the mainworld (check how long this
takes on average). You are conducting atrocity warfare against an Imperial
planet.  You are fighting an attrition war with an entire planet (temporary
taxes to deal with the Pirate Menace, then a quick call to InstellArms,
anyone ?). And you expect to make money ?

From memory, Vargr pulled that stunt once. It was called the Rape of
Antares, if memory serves me, and triggered centuries of bad feeling
between human and vargr in the Julian Protectorate area. Can someone add
more detail ?

Pirates require at least 3 gees of acceleration. More if they want to play
with competantly-built SDBs. 3 gees of acceleration pushes your power plant
size up, as does the additional weaponary.

The spinal mount particle accelerator (to stop those annoying sand clouds
giving the target time to compute the jump solution) or other highly
upgraded weaponary is often a giveaway as well. Except if Famile Spofulam
makes it to megacorporation size (we modified Andrew Vallance\'s RoM 200
dton Far Trader to include a spinal meson gun. Admittadly it wasnt a big
one, but it was a spinal meson gun ...).

Note that if piracy is rampant (for example, due to a collapse of central
authority and/or an abscence of fleet), it will be harder to identify
pirates, because every ship will be either armed, or escorted by an armed
ship.

IMO if you want piracy, then go to a true frontier period (the Spinward
Marches circa 1100 isnt really a frontier ... it\'s more a militarised
border area IMO) or to one of the Civil Wars. An abscence of piracy is one
of the things that makes a stable Imperium prosperous.

Nahh. Having low maneuver kills in space combat. Go for a custom warship,

But how do the informants get the news to the pirates before the frigate
captain decides to change the plan ?

It would be really really mean for the anti-pirate agencies (\'Hortalez et
Cie Special Section\') to get at an informant and arrange a surprise.

In which case insurance rates for trading at that system will rise,
reducing trade and inducing those that come along to get Combat Rated for
insurance purposes.

Atrocity warfare is not a habit of any of the Interstellar states in Known
Space. Except for the K\'kree, and during the Second Civil War.

In which case you are going to have orginised merchant convoys. Fifteen Far
Traders, each with a missile rack, a sandcaster and a laser, one escort
carrier with 6 15 dton Navy fighters and an Elisabeth class riding shotgun
are going to be a problem for most pirates, especially if they want bits to
collect afterwards.

I\'m not real keen on disabling adventurers early on, but if the PC\'s were
passengers on a ship, when the crew became disabled, that would be somewhat
more interesting.

Actually, in GURPS Vehicles, you can build a reactor of whatever size you
want (at least with the rules as they are presented).  I imagine that with
TL-12 manufacturing techniques, you can order a power plant with whatever
output you want.

Actually, In GURPS vehicles, having one power plant is usually a little
more efficient in terms of weight and space than having multiple plants,
because of the lack of redundancy of such things as control systems.

You have changed the argument from qualitative to quantitative. 

 I agree that in a quantitative environment energy is not conserved.

Agreed.  So, you ensure that the early symptoms of [f-i-t-b Plague] are
similar to the symptoms of [f-i-t-b nuisance illness], just as the early
symptoms of pneumonia are very similar to those of any number of minor
illnesses (fever, cough, general discomfort).

*Which disease do the PCs have?*

(If one is playing G:T, that opens up another possibility:  How does
f-i-t-b Plague interact with Space Sickness?)

Haven\'t had a chance to see GURPS: Traveller, but it sounds like Loren has
done a bang-up job.

Here\'s a thought...how about some Marc Miller authored G:T material?

And, when T5 finally hits the stands, how about making it a standard for both
of having a page or so in the back of the supplements, adventures, etc.,
allowing for easy conversion from one system to the other (i.e., have all the
stats repeated)...

Just a thought that might help increase the overall audience plus keep your
writing juices flowing as well!

More effective?  How?  If large wads of cash could buy a starship this way
for less than you could buy one at the shipyard, why doesn\'t the crew just
fly off with the thing and forget you altogether?

At law 9+, there WILL be a cop (secret or uniformed), soldier, or
surveillance system (?warbots?) on every corner, or a well-developed
system of informing on \'disloyal\' citizens.

IMTU, law and order spending is a separate item equal to
(law level) percent of the budget to partly simulate this.

Umm... (embarrassed grin) :-
I have to confess I don\'t have a copy of TCS or IS.
Would someone be able to send the relevant data to me?

On military spending :-
RW ranges from 0.3% GNP (Brazil, Mexico) to 26.8% (Iraq) for 1987.
The US spent 6.4%.
(ref : The Economist Book of Vital World Statistics, 1990).

I think 50 local Cr/person/year is a very reasonable average figure ; it
corresponds to 1% of gross system product.

Overly militaristic systems may be very interesting places to adventure
in (heh heh heh).

Limiting factors :-
population, size of state, communications networks, amount of spending
in R&D, other cultural factors.

The 3I has more people(?), better communication networks, and spend a
lot on R&D (for all the Research Stations we have heard about, what
about the really black ones? Or the megacorporate equivalents?).

The Solomani lack the internal cohesion of the 3I, despite the Party, so
information exchange is not optimal.
Also, multiple smaller states implies duplication of research, and
smaller population bases to draw talent from.
[However, it is widely described that the Solomani are the
masters of biomedical technology in Charted Space (TL 16?) -
must attribute to other cultural factors e.g. a head start in the
Interstellar Wars period].

The Zho probably have a "psionic TL" of 16 (in the absence of a formal
scale). Most other items in their culture are controlled by psionic
\'flicking\' : computers, vehicles, medical tech, weapons ("Trigger? What
trigger?").
The stratification of society into Nobles, Intendants and Proles,
and lifelong psionic screening and training, leads to a
significant diversion of effort away from other research areas.

In sum :- stability is a double-edged sword. Too much or too little
stifles advancement.

I assume the underlying \'Tech Level vs time\' curve is sigmoid (a
rectangular hyperbola).

The aggressive, \'stability-optimised\' interstellar state with
average TL 17+ hasn\'t yet been encountered.
[??The initiators of the Empress Wave??]

Footnote :-
Once the average TL (across areas eg. computing, energy production,
etc.) rises beyond a critical value, Singularity
a la Vernor Vinge\'s \'Marooned in Realtime\' is inevitable.
Grandfather in his pocket universe springs to mind.
