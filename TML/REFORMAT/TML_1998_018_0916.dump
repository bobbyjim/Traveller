Because they dont have access to the resources to get themselves new
identities, fence the ship etc that result in not getting caught by the
ship\'s owner and/or the authorities. Being on the run with no support

Waitaminute.

I thought that worlds could make war on each other freely under the 3I, as
long as they did not violate the Imperial Rules of War. If that was the
case, I could easily see why a planet would want some system defenses as a
deterrant (especially considering that orbital surpremacy really ruins a
planet\'s day).

Say population A planet X decides "SDBs, we don\' need no stinkin\' SDBs. So
we loose a few cargos to pirates -- so what?" Then population 8 or 9 planet
Z (ruled by the ruthless charismatic dictator who believes in a sound
military budget) decides, "hey, let\'s invade planet X." The lack of system
defense forces for planet X would be a liability in this case.

Anyway, if big daddy *does* protect you, then pirates have a hard time
existing (cause the Imperial navy is pretty awesome).

And keeping captured crewmen as breeding stock for their biological
experiments.  The Robots were trying to find a cure for the disease
that killed all of their creators.  Eventually, they managed to find
the cure and cloned a number of the original biologicals.
Unfortunately, they "forgot" that they weren\'t the bosses and
continued to use the biologicals as stock for continuing
experiments.  A few humans and sabmiqy bios have escaped to the wild
countryside where they hide from the "reign of steel."

Well, there *was* that.  ;-> The robots didn\'t want more "infected"
ships bringing diseases to kill their already dead "masters."

I don\'t remember the issue number, but I reread the article a couple
of weeks ago.

  What would you estimate the initial market capitalization of a band of

would the prospectus read, and on what bourse would you recommend floating it?

  The legal ship may have problems if it\'s cargo manifests are suspicious,
especially with all those low-profit (?) deep space runs. Presumably the

I wonder how much a naval crew would really cost, though? Salaries are one
thing, but what about training? Figure maybe MCr 3-5 for each of the
senior officers, and MCr 0.5-1.5 for many of the juniors in positions like
gunnery, sensors, piloting... SDB crews may actually need MORE training
considering the wide range of enviroments they operate in. Look at the
cost of subarmine crew, now add training in gas giant, submarine, space
and air tactics.

Then there are maintaining the naval bases, the pensions you are paying
out to everyone who retired, day care for kids...

Furthermore, how much of the Navy budget goes to research and
development? Sure, we know the imperium is "TL15 for the next x centuries"
but would the navy feel like that? In any case, new ships are coming and
they must be tested, new missiles developed... also, though this is rarely
reflected in game terms, it is likely that electronic warfare gear is
regularly software/hardware module upgraded every 5-10 years just because
the other guy is doing the same thing...

So what I\'m saying is, can you reasonably say that this much of the navy
share of GDP goes into construction and maintainance of fleet units?

Out of curosity, how many capital ships (cruisers, carriers) does the US
Navy muster at present? If you multiply that by 10 for the difference
between the US and a 2-billion high-pop world, and then, perhaps, double
it (because the Imperial Navy doesn\'t have the Air Force eating its share
of the budget..) then I\'d say you\'d have a fare idea how many ships a
world spending about 4% of GDP could pump into the sector navy *and
support with the necessary bases, training and personnel and
infrastructure" which are quite possibly largerly independent of TL7 to
TL15 differences.

And blessed is New Zealand for that! :-)

I was speaking tongue in cheek, so I hope no offense was taken. However,
seeing the quality of the recent spate of film adaptations of the fantasy
genre -- Hercules, Xena, Conan, Sinbad (the series), Dragonheart, Kull, and
so on -- I cringe to think of a LotR motion picture.

ObTrav: Kevin Sorbo as Strephon.

No really ... fantasy in the Traveller universe. Has anyone done a TNE-era
setting using a classic pseudo-fantasy background, where high-tech takes the
place of magic? I did a space opera/science fantasy setting once using the
Rebellion as a background, and that was really fun. But I am imagining
something more like Fred Saberhagen\'s _Empire of the East_, with
Virus-haunted machines rather than nuclear demons (FYI, magic existed in
Saberhagen\'s setting, the result of what was essentially a world-wide
nuclear damper system. When it was turned on during the war, things
*changed*, and previous inanimate forces -- like the conflaguration of a
nuclear explosion, or the energy in a city\'s power grid -- took on life as
spirits and demons).

  The last Trav game I was involved in (CT/Striker, `88?) used the following:
Brawling/Martial Arts - add skill to damage with hand or foot (1D).
Weapon (cutlass, axe, etc.) - add skill to damage.

  In either case the damage added was allocated as a separate "die"; thus,
a foot strike for 1D at skill 3 (pretty good for CT/HG/etc.) would be 1D to
a random physical stat, plus 3 points to one of the other two stats.

  OTOH, if my opponents body armour is really vulnerable to punches I\'d
really rather have an SMG...

Requires...or allows?  I have a hard time believing the Imperium (or any
authoritative govt) would actively encourage a world to build it\'s forces up
to the point of being an inconvenience.  And before I am buried under a flood
of posts pointing out that no single system can withstand the might of the
Imperium...remember the Interstellar Wars?  A real local force can cause a
significant headache to a far larger govt...you can look to both Vietnam and
Somalia as examples of this, as well as the Solomani Autonomous Sphere, which
IIRC was set up to defuse this exact situation.

So by this reckoning...if a system has 2500 SDB\'s, they would all show up for
one pirate?  Or for that matter, every police unit would respond to a
convenience-store hold up?   They would only use what they PERCIEVE as a
necessary level of response...and if they are overconfidant, they will likely
make mistakes; "Oh our system defenses are too strong, no pirate would dare
operate here here, the Japanese Fleet can\'t attack us here...-)
.
>So at worst, you may have 2 SDBs responding to a typical distress call

>>For a typical 400 T corsair that\'s one too many.

Why is everyone so quick to push the 400-ton corsair button??  While I have
not sat down and done a design (under MT) for a corsair, I would not start at
less than 1000 tons; canonically, a Leviathan-class Merchant (1800 tons) is
being used for piracy.

To use another idea from Trav canon (admitedly this will stretch the arguement
a bit, but that doesn\'t invalidate it) is the sale of military-surplus
warships (remember Oberlindes?)  True, these starships are disarmed if
operating w/in the Imperium (which IMTU, only applies to heavy ordinance:
lasers and sand turrets are usually left intact.  Even without the PAW, a
Lightning-class cruiser is a significant reason to "stand and deliver!"

And just what makes an SDB so tough, anyway?  They are armed with nothing more
than you are...and they will NOT have nukes ( it is QUITE clear that only the
Imperial Navy has the right of possesion and use of nukes;  it is also clear
that local defenses are just that, LOCAL.  The use of nukes is an edge that
the Imperium will not relinquish under any circumstances.  The ramifications
of this on starship combat is obvious)  

Just remember the old saying:  Outlaw nukes and only outlaws will have them!
:-)

Pirates have to be where their prey is, which happens to be where the
system defenses are too. 

>Besides, replacing system defenses, for a lot of systems, will
>take time and money...which may not always be available.

So you have all your SDBs at the jump point?  Ok...which one?  Do you escort
the merchants in?  Do you assign all your SDBs to escort them, or just one?
Enquiring minds want to know...<G>

combat system has come up I\'d like to offer my humble $NZ0.039 (at todays 
exchange rates).

What I\'d like to see in the T5 combat system. Well I\'d like to see _Two_ 
combat systems.

The first should a simple (one page max, a sidebar would be ideal) system 
based on T4 for those (like me) who are satisfied when being hit by a gun 
makes you fall over.
Basically take penetration subtract armour and that the number of dice you roll 
for damage. Add a couple of special cases (shotguns, blowthrough rule) etc. 
Make the to hit role a difficult (?) task at effective range getting easier closer 
and harder further (add in a couple of special rules for hasty fire and called 
shots). As long as its fundimentally realistic (you get shot you fall over) I don\'t 
care if its fairly corse.

The second should be an expansion of the simple system for those who like to 
go into greater detail. This system should have rules for recoil, variable damage 
(the +d -d thing), differing types of damage etc (basically the T5 system).

Basically what I want is a fast play combat system and a gearhead combat 
system. The fast play should be a simplified version of the gearhead one.

Would they?  In a previous post I mentioned the fact that local defenses would
NOT have access to nuclear missiles...only Imperial forces do (this is the
great equalizer for the Navy)  So a 1000dt purpose-built raider/privateer or
mil-surplus warship (canonical examples exist) would have a large advantage
over a 400-ton SDB, depending on the TL of the SDB (a TL 11 SDB, in spite of
Agility advantage, which is by no means guarenteed, likely, but not certain,
can be met on better than even terms by a raider w/ a Model 9 comp)  And since
the pirates are criminals anyway...they aren\'t squeamish about having and
using nukes (look at the North Hollywood bank robbery last year in LA).

For each individual world...a world w/ 10000 citizens would have KCr 20,000
per year for local defense...not very much, yes?  However, TCS allows an
initial outlay of 10 years worth of money for your starting fleet...MCr 2.
Most likely no space-based defenses other than defense sats; so aerospace
fighters for close orbit maybe.

Now a world w/ 10,000,000 citizens would have MCr 20 per year, times 10 gives
MCr200.  Still not a lot, but some armed fighters or small craft can be
gotten.

At 1,000,000,000 pop, you now get MCr20,000 per year...this will allow a major
system defense presence.  But remember, your Army and COACC forces come out
ofthis budget, too.

The same thing that makes a battle rider tough -- no jump drive and (more

be used for manuever drives, weapons, and armor. So a SDB is, ton-for-ton,
badder than a jump-capable pirate.

  Medieval castles were almost impossible to starve out by blockade, and sapping
was definitely a non-trivial undertaking (failure could turn the situation into
a starvation siege, which would have been the attackers first choice if it were
in their best interests).

  The Maginot Line would have worked perfectly well if it had been completed -
budgetary problems in the `30\'s resulted in its\' northern flank being left open.

  Japanese strategy was pretty impressively challenged in many respects - if 
not they\'d hardly have attacked the US.

  Luckily the Japs didn\'t have FC radar :>  There\'s actually an article in
last years fall issue of the Journal of Military History that goes into a
great deal about the deployments of the US battleships in the year after
Pearl (it\'s also something of an attack on a rather bad book titled: Sacred
Vessels, but I digress...).

  The bottom line appears to be that a greater use of battleships in the
area was against USN policy at the time, and that the only alternative to
attritting through lighter surface units was withdrawal.

  SDB\'s will have good computers and high Agility (important, under HG), heavy
armour, and military grade weapons. I\'m not sure that planetary SDB\'s wouldn\'t
be allowed access to nukes, as they must stockpile them for wartime use.

  You might try the following boat against a supposed pirate vessel in a
stand up fight - a 4000 tonner can probably do it at TL 12-13, but I doubt
that you\'ll have any luck worth mentioning with TL 12 designs that could
actually pass itself off as a profitable freighter.

                SB-A1068F2-C50000-60002-0       MCr 1433        1000 tons
        batteries bearing   1     1   3                            TL=12
                batteries   1     1   3                          Crew=20 
        Cargo=160*. Fuel=80. EP=80. Agility=6.

  * - there\'s nothing left to spend the tonnage on under HG; armour, agility,
comp/sensors are all maxxed. Upgrading to more energy weapons seems needless
at 3% per factor. Add troops, ships\' boats, fighters, magazines; maybe a pool
hall - a pigboat doesn\'t have to be dull...

  The crew works out to be around 20 under both Book 2 (the engineer per 35 tons
of drives does not work worth a damn for HG designs - the drives here are over
three times the combined tonnage of the 6-rating X-drives on p.22) and HG (where
the ship has _nine_ command staff, and isn\'t even Jump-capable).

  The remaining tonnage could easily be more fuel and even a J-1 unit, but that
gets into a world of strategic paperwork that FFW/TCS tried to avoid...

<RANT!>
The WHOLE BLOODY POINT was to eliminate the need for fiddling with Power.

Based upon the Simple Ship Design Sequence (a paraphrase)

A module includes the power systems to make the items in the module work.
While the stuff in the module is installed as a unit FOR THE PURPOSES OF
THE DESIGN SYSTEM, it actually is installed as part of the various areas,
NOT MODULE BY MODULE. So, all the "Pieces of Powerplant" actually create
ONE power plant, and the actual volume in the turret is just the weapons
and access space, with that space being shared from the staterooms for the
crewmen, etc. Heck, the module could even include the remote fire control
station for the bridge.

Adding unpowered modules DEFEATS THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE SIMPLIFIED SYSTEM!!!

I looked at the beta of G:T Behind The Claw, but its a very thin description.

I think you should take a whack at it and share what you come up with.
That population will probably limit what development there is.
How many people would be employed at the navy base, the scout base, and
the class A starport?  Out of 900.  I\'m guessing it would be the great
bulk of that population.

  Weren\'t you pointing out that the Imperium gets _very_ upset about the

  I have to agree that a TL 15 1000 ton Jump warship could beat the snot
out of a TL 11 SDB, especially a poorly designed one (Agility <6).

I know *lots* of good Mormons who LOVE country & western.  My dad\'s one of

For interests sake...
Indeed this is true, although the Maginot line was never originally
intended to cover the northern flank.  It was simply a Bulwark to protect
the projection of Alsace-Lorraine.  With the co-operation of Belgium (not
actually forthcoming as it turned out) the Northern flank was well secure.
The Gemans never penetrated the line proper (not that it was a \'line\'), and
the demonstration attacks carried out to see if this were possible on a
large scale were abkject failures. (This is not to say that there were some
technical failings)  Goerinmg is alledged to ahve wept with range at the
lack of damage done by his vaunted bombers.  [The giant Mortars KARL, and
the super guns, Dora, could, if they had been built in time and survived
emplacement, and counter battery fire, have had a serious impact upon
them.]  The interconnected fortified zones even provided a considerable
obstacle to the Allies when defended by small German forces, and with most
of their embrasures pointinmg in the wrong direction.  Two excellent books

This is sort of the thing I had in mind. Basically, one of my group is the
pilot, the rest are the passengers. But if the group has no ship of their
own and has to travel by agency, this would be the sort of adventure, I am
most up to ... and the disabling would not be complete.

Early symptoms are loss of motorical, plus loss of sight. Now
consider the pilot explaining the controls to a passenger, who perhaps
only led a ship\'s boat once ... (scenes taken from \'flights in peril\'-

crippled the ship\'s computer emergency program.

Sort of. One of the rules is \'No-one makes war in space but us\'. This may

In Australia, if people start shooting at police, then large amounts of

Where does our hypothetical pirate get that sort of money ?

Also, the bigger the pirate, the more money you need to keep it running,
and the more likely it is some subsector Admiral will want to make his
career on you.

SDBs have armour, agility, secure bases, no need for jump fuel and no need
for spare crew or cargo space. Under HG they also have the best available
computers, if I am anywhere near the design bureau building them.

Sending up enough nukes to get through a single damper is an expensive
business. Use of nukes also tends to trigger Imperial attention.

We have the SDBs at the jump point that we advertised for this month in the
Subsector Commercial Shipping News. If, as a pirate, you *want* to play,
then you will play on the grounds of our choosing.

Well the 3I\'s sheer size, the Megacorps, the Navy vs other arms, etc, etc
all mean the same for the 3I.

How about the stratification of society into nobles and non-nobles leads to
everyone attempting to climb the ladder instead of advancing technology (in
the 3I)?

IMO most arguments explaining the 3I\'s superior TL also work back the other
way. The only one that does it for me is "Just because". IMO the 3I has a

None taken by me. I actually quite like Xena, and Hercules a little. One of
the elements that I like is the light-hearted treatment of Greek myth, etc.
I mean it\'s not like the Greek didn\'t rewrite the stuff whenever they felt
it useful or more entertaining, so why shouldn\'t we?

I tend to use Swashbuckler literature when I\'m in need of inspiration.  I
cribbed an entire space opera campaign from _Treasure_Island_, right down
to a one-legged villain named "Argent".  At the end of the campaign, I
handed the players a list of "credits":  "Based on Treasure Island, by R.
L. Stevenson, starring ---- as Jim Hawkins," etc.  You should have seen
their faces.

_The_Three_Musketeers_ is a great source, as is _Captain_Blood_.

I would say that the few that are not directly employed at the two bases
or the starport are indirectly involved, ie as gym owners, restaurant
cooks, and hot dog vendors. This habitation probably wouldn\'t exist if it
weren\'t for this main industry.

With such a small population, the world probably cannot maintain a mining
facility of it\'s own, so it must be dependent on outside deliveries of raw
materials for ship construction, maintenance and repair.

Agriculture might exist, but far away from the main habitated area, since
the tainted atmosphere there would ruin all crops quickly. I assume the
farmers spend the week at the fields, to shift works with someone the next
week. Or perhaps a few oddballs among the population spend most of their
time far away from the City.

I can\'t tell you that, as Real World figures for space navies are difficult
to get hold on. And as someone else pointed out, if a number of different
people are to work on the same shared world and not mess it up, you need
some guidelines. The best guidelines we have are those of TCS and _Striker_.
Obviously TCS presents a very simplified picture, what with ignoring
logistics completely. I\'d have no quarrel with rules attempting to refine
the blanket "annual support is 10% of original cost". But any such refined
figures ought to be in the same ballpark as the 10%. Incidentally, the 10%
figure is very likely to be much higher than anything you can come up with
by going into details, except possibly if you want to support actions a 
_long_ way from the base.

As for Imperial spending, the average spending of an Imperial world is 3%
of GWP with 30% of that going to the Imperium and 60% of the remainder
going to the planetary navy. [Striker]

The 10% figure is said to include everything except replacement of combat
losses. (By implication even natural replacements are covered).

All included.

If you work out the cost of the navy described in _Rebellion_ you\'ll find
that it comes to about 34% of the figure you get if you work out the budget
according to the _Striker_ rules. Believe me, there\'s money left over for
R&D.

Matbe you have, but the canonical information has it that the Imperium gets
a percentage of each individual world\'s military budget. It also says that
the average military spending in the Imperium is 3% (with a 1% minimum and
a 15% maximum). This is less than the TCS figures, but I interpret that to
be because TCS describes small pocket empires.

Nah, they\'d propably only send a couple of squadrons. What they wouldn\'t do
unless they had absolutely no choice would be to make it a fair fight.

Because that\'s the one the canon says is a common pirate vessel.

A 1000 T pirate vessel will need to capture 2.5 times as many ships as a
400 T one to keep in the black. This is a good example of what I talked
about when I accused most pro-pirate solutions of ignoring their underlying
assumptions. As for using a surplus cruiser...

>And just what makes an SDB so tough, anyway?  They are armed with nothing more
>than you are...

Even if it is a fair fight, the pirates are at a disadvantage. The SDB is paid
to fight and if it takes damage, it has a planetary tax base to pay for its
repairs. If a pirate is hit, it has to pay for repairs out of the booty. A
few million-credit repai bills can really ruin a pirate\'s deal.

>So you have all your SDBs at the jump point?  Ok...which one? 

I don\'t need more than one.

>Do you escort the merchants in?

Why should I? The only place where a pirate has any chance of "sneaking up"
on a ship is outside the 100-diameter limit, because he can jump in (that
does mean that he can\'t time his arrival to intercept any particular ship,
but things are tough anyway). So if I guard the place where ships arrive
and assign different approach vectors to different ships, I can intercept
any sneaky pirate masquarading as a merchant inside the limit (the moment
it deviates from its assigned fligt path to intercept another ship, I go
after it).

Steven was talking of para-military ships. A military-grade 1000 T ship will
naturally be at an advantage against a military-grade 400 T ship. It will
also be a lot more expensive than a para-military ship. A Factor 9 computer
adds about MCr200 to the cost to start with.

I\'ve lost you here. Are you saying that the argument that we need to use the
same setting if our discussion is to have any meaning, or are you referring
to a canonical fact that you consider obviously flawed?

Canonical figures are 3% of GWP. In _Striker_ GWP can range up to about
Cr30,000 per citizen for rich, industrialized, high-tech worlds, but I prefer
to use the _PE_ version where average income is Cr10,000 (the credits of
highly productive worlds are worth more). That would give you a military
budget of MCr3 for your 10,000 people. Of that 70% would be retained for
system defenses and of that 60% would go to the planetary navy. So you\'d
have a naval budget of MCr1.26 which would allow you hardware for MCr12.6.
Not enough for even a single SDB. But a world with 100,000 people could have
one and one with a million could have 10. A high-population world could have
10,000, but a lot of that would be in bigger ships, of course.

But, to be fair, the relevant comparison is not ton-for-ton but cr-for-cr.
And there the SDB dosen\'t have quite the same advantage. Though the cost of
the jump drive does handicap the jump ship somewhat.

More effective?  How?  If large wads of cash could buy a starship this way
for less than you could buy one at the shipyard, why doesn\'t the crew just
fly off with the thing and forget you altogether?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
My take on this is that selling an illegally-obtained ship is complex and
dangerous, requiring contacts and skills not commonly found.
IMTU there are hijackers, but most hijacking teams will have little
choice but to turn pirate with their new ship - they\'ll never be able
to make their stolen ship\'s papers check out reliably enough to take
the ship into regular trade.
A few hijacking teams can pull this off, but they make so much money
at one go that they don\'t have to do it very often. ;)

This also applies to mutinous crews, though I can imagine a situation
where a trusting captain wills his ship to a less than trustworthy
crewman...there are a lot of ways to murder someone aboard an
operating starship that will look like an accident.

Note - how many PC Captain/Ship Owners have a last will and testament?
The Captain gets eaten by a Bug-Blatter Beast, the starship you\'ve been
orienting the campaign around gets sent back to the bank...

Even 1% of GWP comes to a huge Imperial navy. And the canonical figure is
3%.

Of course, that dosen\'t mean that we can\'t fiddle a bit with those figures.
But I don\'t like to deviate by even an order of magnitude from the ground
rules unless I have a specific situation with a specific explanation. If
one author goes one way and another, independently, goes the other way, you
suddenly have a HUGE discrepancy.

According to _Striker_ the average planet with breathable atmosphere spends
40% of its military budget on ground forces. One without an atmosphere
spends 8% or thereabouts (I forget). The rest goes to system defenses.
How much of that goes to jump-capable ships is not defined. Certainly the
character generation system suggests that planetary navies have some jump-
capable ships. But cr-for-cr the difference between SDBs and jump ships is
not that great. I don\'t have exact figures, but a world would have almost as
many jump ships as it would SDBs. 75-80% I\'d guess.

Perhaps not "perfectly". There were some fortresses along the low
country blitzkreig routes (Eban Emmanual, for example) that were
reduced in hours by paratrooper surprise assault and/or pioneer
infantry efforts. Granted, the Maginot Line was an monster compared
to these fortresses, but I have heard of some reduction of even that line
occurring.

By air or sea, I\'ll bet even a Mediterranean to Atlantic border fortress
could have been got around. Would the operational limitations of such
an obstacle have prevented Germany from assaulting France? Good
question.

ObTrav: Imagine the mess one TL15 armor unit could make of a TL7
fortress, even one like the Maginot Line. Do Imperial planets even bother
with locally-equipped forces, or do they buy numerically far fewer but
TL-advantaged mercenaries? Recall the situation in David Drake\'s
_Hammer\'s Slammers_ universe - if two sides wanted to fight, the one
that paupered itself hiring off-planet mercenaries would win, no question
about it. The loser is wiped out, the winner is dead broke, the
mercenaries laugh all the way to the bank.

Actually, if you estimate the cost of the Imperial Navy based on various
(IMO) reasonable extrapolations of the information in _Rebellion_, you find
that it comes to 34% of what it would be if you calculate the budget from
3% of total GWP for the Imperium. _ONE_ percent of GWP will pay for those
62.5 ships, an equal number of escorts, a lot of auxiliary vessels PLUS
the same number of subsector fleet ships PLUS 1.5 times the equivalent in
system defenses PLUS about the same amount money\'s worth of ground forces.

At about 30 worlds to a subsector makes two regular, two subsector and
three planetary navy capital ships per world. Now do you see why I
believe a pirate would have problem making a living in the OTU?

Sorry. I tend to focus on the Spinward Marches.

Yep. And in the Spinward Marches area only the Zhodani (and _possibly_ the
Sword Worlds) can do that.

That\'s one of the pirate\'s biggest problems. In space there is no place to
hide. If the pirate is in a position to intercept a ship that jumps into
the system (if he is so lucky that it actually arrives within range of him,
which the odds do not favor) then any system defenses can see him.

Furthermore, if either of these captains get attacked by a lurking

Sorry but that does not jive with the real world.  There are some very rich
contries with little or no military.  The same can go for planets.  Take a
high pop. planet with a high poverty rate and unemployment rate.  A large
chunk of their credits will go to supporting the dole rats.  If the
government started to spend credits on the military all heck would break
loose.  Look at the reduced US military today.  The Empire will have similar
problems and non military expences.   

Also the upkeep of 10% per year may be a bit low.  Check the cost of crew
for the ASH and the Kenunier in their adventure books.  Neither of these
ship are battle ships.  There is also the cocane effect.  If you build 10
battle ships with a service cost of 10% per ship per year then the upkeep is
fully the equal of building a battleship per year.  (See this month Popular
Mechanics on what the US navy has to deal with when talking about its\'
carriers.  I think the average is hight than 10%.)  Also do not forget the
cost of fighters and fighter upgrades.  The same holds true for all the
support for these ships.  The space dock must be maitained.  The supply
ships.  The bases.  The couriers.  R&D.  Administrative offices and staff.
and thousands of other support structures that have to be payed for and
maintained.

That\'s 2000MC, if you can get the people to not spend it on new raods and
better health care.  That is enough to maitain at 10% per year a military of
20000MC.  That is the maintanence cost of 10 Nimitz class carrier.  That\'s
it.  No fighters. No escorts.  No nothing else.  Not even crew saleries.
OOOOppppsss.

Lets see what a planet would need for self defence.  Sorry but I\'m at work
and do not have my books handy so you\'ll have to figure the prices.

1 ground base (min)

1 Army (about .1% of pop. as a Min. plus equipment)

1 wet navy (If there is water.  .1% Pop. plus ships)

1 air force.  (.1% pop. plus planes)

1 SDB squad  (Say 10 SDBs in rotation for matainence and training)

1 Space base for the SDBs and sensor maintainence.

1 sensor web (100 satalite scatter arround the system.)

1 very busy service craft for the satalite network.  Two would be better.

1 pentagon (admin.)

lets see .3% of population that\'s 3 per thousand or 300,000 people for the
ground bases military (not counting admin. staff or maintaince crews.) at
say 10K per year each...3000MC in saleries!

I\'d like to see your calculations for the 1000 battleship & 4000 destroyer
per secter navy!  The maintainence cost alone would take the entire
planetary output of 100 worlds!  That\'s 100% tax for those worlds!

And exactly how do you spot a 1000 meter object at 1 au?  Any pirate worth
the name will be running dark with RAM and scatter coating.  With any decent
nav program you can avoid excess star occlution.  The missles would not have
to be nukes to cause a lot of damage.  They are 1 meter long and perhaps
30cm in diameter with a sensor aspect of a pin point if properly designed.
Coming in on a balistic course they have less energy signature than a 9V
battery.  Good lucj spotting them.

Well the cargo much absorb the cost of shiping.  I think that is 2k per ton
per jump.  The cargo must be work cost + 2k per ton.  If the cost were cheep
like dirt or rock at say 100c per ton then the final cost would be 2100c per
ton.  Much to much!  One ton of IBM PCs at 1kc per PC and 100 PC per ton the
cost of shiping 1 parsec would add 20c to the price of each unit.  Not to
much really.  I\'d say that not counting emergencies the cost per ton would
need to be at least 2k per jump to ofset the cost of shipping.  That makes
shiped in good have a markup of 100% minimum to cover shiping.  Not an
unreasonable markup by todays standards for consumer goods.

I expect convoys to start up.  The Navy will not be present (except local
ones) as the players are cut of in a pocket.  They have to \'make do\' with
what they can scratch up.  There will be a high pop. TL10 world, a med. pop.
TL13 world, and several others.  The cental core of on subsecter posible in
the Marches.  None have what it takes to build up their defences on their
own but by trading they can all get what they need.  It\'s a Yankee trader
type campain where the players are traped in the situation unless they want
to run the gauntlet back to Core secter.

For those of you who enjoy tactical, hex-based ship-to-ship
combat, the DSR rules are *great* for relatively small actions
(no more than 3-4 ships per side _max_...IMO, of course).

They work very well for military/para-military campaigns and
can even be used as part of fleet level combat in which PCs
take an active part. Basically, use DSR for the action
affecting the PCs\' ship and keep the high-level combat rules
in the T4 book (or HG) for the rest of the fleet. It really
adds alot when the PCs are fighting for their lives and pick
up other dogfights which flow in and out of their sensor
range.

Obviously, if the ship-to-ship combat is a minor part of the
adventure, stick with the high-level rules.

The cocane effect will not allow this level of military build up.  You have
to deduct the cost of maintainence of the current ships from the budget
before you figure what you can build.  10% of the cost of the ships would
pay for maintainence and maybe crew saleries but I dought that.  What about
ammo, bases, training, pentions, supply ships, ect.  10% just does not cover
it based on current military spending on the wet navy.

Actually you have everywhere to hide.  Space is a big place.  Searching even
a 1 AU distance circle for a 1000 meter spherical ship with lidar would take
millinia.  If an object is not a signal emitter it\'s tough to find in all
that blackness.  Stelth has it\'s uses.

As a matter of fact, yes.  But is could have been used with any Trav
Setting.

It was at a convention, I misjumped the PC\'s to a world where "magic"
exists.
They even had strange minor human races called "orks" and "elves" and
things.

Come to find out that "magic" was realy psionics and magic items such as
"fireball staff" was realy an ancient  FGMP-21.
It was one of those "fireball staves" the PC\'s had to retreive from an
evil "wizard" sgo that the good "wizard" would tell them where to find
"magic crystals" to fix their Jump Drive.  It was the classic
"Romp-through-the-evil-wizards-tower/dungeon"  we all know and love.

The adventure was known as "Clarke\'s Law" ;->

I\'m leaning toward the military-base-with-supporting-civilians idea. One interesting
twist, though, is that the government is a feudal technocracy. Ah, yes, that
so-hard-to-define type we all love. I will take a stab at it and post the results to

Interesting take, and I can see it too.  Then there is that Grayson

Actually, that was only one of the points.  Note that I only include unpowered

No, it just defeats one of the purposes.  Adding power requirements to a level
of resolution comparable with the CT high guard isn\'t crippling, and it remains
quite simple (as, to be honest, the major complexity of Vehicles is with
incidental systems, not power consumption).

Cosmic rays and background radiation. Over a 50,000 year span, anything
built of IC\'s will be dead as a doornail, scrambled beyond recognition.

The problem is that as your data gets denser, it becomes more
susceptible to events like a cosmic ray strike.

Also, all sorts of weird things happen in crystals that sit for 50,000
years when they depend on specific contaminants to work...you get stuf
diffusing over the junctions, metals dissolving into the silicon, etc.
This doesn\'t happen on our time scale, but on near geological ones like
50kyr, it will.

Probably all ready considered, but... if a system can afford 2500 SDBs,
there is a good chance that the civilian merchant sector is just as well
capitalized, and the system is crawling with some 25 *thousand* small
craft from pinnaces to ore transporters, thousands of orbital habitats
and space platforms, and thousands of seekers in its asteroid belts and
jovian moons, and god knows what else. Don\'t forget that pirates should
be able to prey on a lot more than just the traffic too and from jump
point.

To avoid complete information overload, it wouldn\'t suprise me if
everyone\'s funky super-cool transponders are only required for
interstellar craft ... the small craft just build and proliferate too
fast. If you have an asteroid settlement (and most high pop high tech
worlds probably do) you\'ll get teenagers slamming a few engines onto a
frame and going joyriding, for that matter... Maybe the best option for
pirates is a surplus interstellar ore carrier with a big cargo bay and a
couple of surplus TL12 SDBs from a world that has upgraded to TL13-14, 
for preying on those TL8-11 systems... disguise the SDBs with some
cosmetic work to make \'em look like in-system cargo haulers.

Exactly. I want an SDB for piracy! Get a few 200-400 ton SDBs, take a
Levianthan class 1800 merchant cruiser, rip out much of the guts, and use
it a carrier. Stay out near the edge of the system, or vanish and come
back later. Even if you don\'t play the transponder game as above, if you
buy TL12 SDBs and hunt in TL9-11 systems you can probably out run the
local defenses. If necessary do some minor remodelling to give you
10-20 tons cargo. Use a pair of SDBs, and if necessary fit them with
grapples so you can tow away your target (and blow the tow line if the
enemy fleet comes by) if you hit something that is interesting but won\'t
fit in the cargo bay...

AD&D had a module that had the characters exploring a crashed
spaceship.  I used that module as a basis for a CT adventure (I used
their vessel instead of the one in the module).  I explained the
switch from technology to magic using Zelazny\'s Amber idea,
dimentional travel, but caused by ionizing ration in the atmosphere
(lame, I know, but we were young an foolish).  The characters found
their way back to their ship (they crashed their ship\'s boat) by
amassing wealth and power, then using teleportation spells when the
ship orbited close enough.  Their technology was useless on Greyhawk
(gunpower, too) and their magic items and spells were useless back on
their ship.  The gold and jewels that they amassed were real, though. 
To convert stats I just used 1.5x and for hit points I started them
out as 3rd or fourth level AD&D as rolled.  I assigned their types
(mage, fighter, thief, etc.) based on their backgrounds.

targets at typical missile engagement ranges (i.e., 200,000 miles or so).
Installing sensors capable at point blank ranges (circa 20,000 miles)
was considered in the first draft, but as they essentially doubled the
cost of the missile, it was considered more economical to remove them.

In GT, the Imperium makes reasonably extensive use of smart drone missiles

in space, you do not usually have line of sight considerations (exceptions

  An assault of the type made on Eben Emael would not be relevant to an
extensive fortified zone. In any case, the line was meant to be backed
up masses of (~static) infantry divisions, and the French were developing
their own armoured divisions with effective modern doctrine. The result
would have been a static front with the attacker placed at a serious
disadvantage, possibly in political no less than military terms.

  Troops raised on local resources may not be capable of defending against
high-tech foreigners - which is why the protection rackets run by various
pocket empires (e.g., the Third Imperium) are so popular. OTOH, relying on
outsiders who stay and visit will interfere in local politics and creates
a whole new mess of (potentially insoluble) internal security issues. It
might be best to follow Machiavelli on this one.

  If you\'re going to jump around 100 D then how can a different point on
that sphere add four hours to flight time?

  Wouldn\'t the agricultural colony in question be a separate traffic control/
security zone, presumably with its own security force(s)? If it\'s undefended
why wouldn\'t a pirate just land and loot?

  How tiny is this agricultural colony such that its\' main export crop is
sufficient to fill one small trader? How poorly developed is its\' economy
such that there\'s no middlemen with export contracts (and freight, rather
than speculative trade shipping arrangements made) already in place - are
the locals bringing in their harvests in horse-drawn carts?

  Depends on whether the ships loss will have a negative impact on
their economy.

"Bruce\'s DSR" are the sensor rules - called, in a fit of megalomania, the
"Definitive Sensor Rules" that go with the sensors in FFS2. They use a 
log range scale - so calculating if you see someone is just a matter of 
adding your sensitivity and his signature and seeing if they\'re >=0 (not
an idea original to me.) The actual numbers are based on some moderately
detailed simulations of IR and visible-light detection that I did, including
all the obvious factors (thermal background from the sensor itself depending
on what temperature you cool it to, thermal emission from zodiacal dust, 
scattered sunlight from dust, reflectance of spacecraft, emissivity of
spacecraft, arrangement and temperature of spacecraft radiators, etc), so
I believe they\'re very accurate (and lead to surprisingly long detection
ranges.) Modifiers for various conditions (like being in a young dusty
solar system) are also based on simulations. There are ECM rules (somewhat
rough currently) too. Overall I\'m quite proud of it. Embarassingly, I\'ve
misplaced the web page URL where someone is keeping it for me...Joe Heck\'s,
I think.

This is one of the things I didn\'t necessarily like about MTrav...a top-of-

  Weren\'t you pointing out that the Imperium gets _very_ upset about the

  BTW, they ended up shot up, didn\'t they?

Well, since the pirates are already liable for a death sentence for
piracy...just how much more upset can the Navy get?  And while the bank
robbers did get waxed, they seemed to me to be staying to shoot it out w/ the
cops...I think they could have escaped if the chose to.

I\'ve lost you here. Are you saying that the argument that we need to use the

Yes...again, I am not attempting to argue this from a canonical point of view.

Why not? They\'ve got the G\'s to intercept traffic easily (so the traffic

(Hand-wave mode, *on*):

The agricultural colony has ironclad laws that all it\'s produce must
be sold directly to the main world. There is one loophole: On the first
day of harvest, the farmers are allowed to sell what they reap to anyone
with the credits - bypassing the state-appointed buyers the farmers get
rooked by every other day of the year. Until recently, this was a kind
of festival where well-off dilettantes would fly their in-system private
craft to the colony and buy the wonderful melons from the yokels for
only a few credits more than the "official" price. Then a free trader
captain heard about it, and showed up with more than pocket change
in hand and enough cargo space to haul off the lot. The farmers are
a lot happier, though the flavor of the festival has been a bit different
for the past year or so.

The "Harvest Festival" isn\'t well known yet, and the one or two free trader
captains who do know about it can outbid the state-controlled bids of
the local buyers easily - if they get there first. They can even outbid
the local rich people, as the farmer would rather sell his whole cargo
at once for some profit instead of haggle over each melon with some
rich twit who thinks you should give him the melon for nothing.
There isn\'t a lot to buy, 100tons or so (one day\'s harvest), but these will 
probably be the only Busava melons going outsystem without spending 
two months in a government warehouse - therefore the High-pop planet
two parsecs from here will pay astronomical prices for this delicacy.

(handwave mode, *off*)

There will be many situations where a single free trader can make
ten times (or hundreds of times) more profit at a particular port
simply by getting there first. The next trader will still find goods, but
the one cargo bay full of an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime deal will
be gone.

And let\'s not forget that the planet is *moving*, so if you end up
trailing it, you will have a longer approach than if you come out of jump
"in front of" it.

At least, unlike disney, Herculese, Xena, Sinbad, Kull, etc are OBVIOUSLY
NOT Historical. Disney at one point put that abomination "Pocohontus" onto
their Historical Films List (Prerelease)... The only thing they got right
was the list of names.

On the gripping hand, there is another option. Instead of buying
1000 TL6 tanks, go to the nearest high-tech planet and buy
10 TL12 Grav Tanks, training in their use, and maintenance
gear for them. Your 10 Grav Tanks would probably win against
his 1000 tracklayers.

Would low-tech planets in the Imperium do this kind of thing?
Buy tiny amounts of high-tech gear instead of massive amounts
of locally-produced gear? I think in most cases the answer would
have to be yes.

I don\'t think a man with a laser rifle is that much more effective
than a man with an assault rifle in a low-tech combat, so there
are some formations in which such an expenditure wouldn\'t be
prudent. Armor, air support, communication and artillery come to
mind as places where one off-world item might match 100 local
items.

Another thing to think about: Let\'s say you have a TL3 planet
with a unified government. There\'s really no point in it keeping
a TL3 army on hand, except as a police force (usually paid
for seperately from the military, btw). Your only possible enemy
will arrive by starship, wearing combat armor and riding grav
vehicles. If your combat formations can\'t face that kind of
enemy, there\'s almost no point in maintaining the army - therefore
any world with a unified government will almost have to maintain
an army equipped to "modern" standards. With every level the local
tech level drops below "modern", this army will be smaller (to reflect
the effort required to maintain grav tanks in a combustion-engine
world, for example).

Compare two pop-9 worlds, one TL12, one TL6. The TL12 world will
probably have deep-mount meson guns all over the place, grav tank
formations, combat armored troops toting laser rifles and the
occaisional plasma gun, the whole nine yards from orbit to
sea bottom. The TL6 world might have a grav tank formation (as in
one), a deep-mount meson gun (as in one), and some improved
sensor and commo gear, all clustered around the starport.
The rest of the TL6 planet will have almost no army at all, as the
entire defense budget went to these few horrendously expensive
items.

The above is probably necessary - think of what one type-S scout ship
could have done to 1930\'s Europe all by itself.

Sounds a lot like the Norfolk\'s Tears setup in The Reality Dysfunction.
Except on Norfolk you had a window of oppurtunity that began within a
certain period of time, related to local conditions.  Not profitable for
the big shippers to beach a freighter for several days to weeks waiting for
the Tears to be ready.  Mostly, it was the small time free traders who made
the profit from that run.

Sadly, Norfolk is no longer with us in this world...

If the pirate is at 1 AU, how is it going to intercept merchant ships jumping
out at 100 diameters (800,000 miles, less than 0.01 AU)? It\'ll take a 1-G
merchant only a few hours to go from the surface to 100 diameters; the pirate
will never even get into weapons range.

(I can\'t believe I\'m entering into a piracy debate...)

If the pirate *is* lurking close enough to catch merchants, a big military
sensor array will probably detect it - space is very dark, IR emissions from
warm objects are surprisingly easy to see - unless it has its power plant
completely shut down and has very good thermal masking. Take a look at my
sensor rules and FFS2...It\'s very unlikely even with this that one could
hide from the very large military arrays a high-pop high-TL world would have
if you were as close as 100 diameters; you still need some power for life 
support, and hence will have some IR emissions. 

My personal take is that if you *really* want piracy, you should move the
100-diameter limit out to ~10 million miles instead...

          All depends of your technology.  At TL-17+ computer systems are
      effectivly made of solid blocks of crystal, or some other substance
      and etched to form the pathways of the computers circuits.  I believe
      that by the time TL-17+ hits they will have formed some type of
      protection against cosmic rays.  In Webbers book series \'Armagedon
      Inheritance\' the older computers were made in this way, so even after
      50,000 yearsthey still worked if power was applied.  The ones that
      were newer had the memory contained of focused force fields, so when
      the power died so to did the information.  Just goes to show to
      seperate high tech looks at computer data storage.

Funny you should mention that.  I\'ve been grinding that idea through the back
of my head for a couple weeks now, that the Roswell UFO was really an
off-course Vilani free trader, and the wreck was in good enough shape that the
Americans developed jump drive from it.  Kind of what happened with the Aslan,
remember?

Of course the Solomanis would *kill* to keep that secret safe...

No one said this is their main export, or even that they are that big.
Maybe its a five or six family co-op, they have the annual (small, labor
intensive, but profitable) Busava Melon crop in, and the Five Family\'s
melons are well known and coveted a system over. Boutique cropping, it\'s
done in the US all the time, and the total crop is way too low to
support middlemen.

Well, some people have objections to cooling (along the lines
that lHyd is not a great coolant) but that then gets into
the great "what does jump drive use all that hydrogen for"
debate.

As far as the art goes, I don\'t think anyone has ever labled

anything from heat exhaust to main engines, feel free.

Since SDB\'s are cheaper than Patrol Cutters, I use SDB\'s in any system

are rich enough to build PC\'s (A starport, TL 12+).

Why PC\'s in non-local production areas? Annual Maintenance is much easier
to achieve if you can get to a place for mainenance.

SDB\'s also sometimes appear in systems which cannot locally
build/repair/maintain, but then the system usually also purchases a jump

Sometimes, I\'ll also put Gazelle CE\'s into such a system as the backbone of
the system\'s combat/anti-piracy forces.

Almost all near-world planetary naval ships will have some capability for
customs enforcement... and which are you more likely to argue with: 3 SDB\'s

another reason for jump-capable system ships is to be able to jump to

Only if they were abysmally led and lined up to be shot...

If the other side\'s 1000 tanks are operating in 20 50 tank batallions

It\'s be worse if insatead of 1000 TL-6 tanks, the guy went out and

No, because all that those thousands of low tech troops have to do is
take the starport, depriving you of your spares, and your elite offworld
Hightech force is going to be toast.

Commo...maybe. Air, I doubt it. One F-16 is going to smoke a Mig-17
everyu time, but line 15 with competent pilots in them against it...the
F-16 is gone. Unless the 16 can stand off and take them all out with
long range missiles, it\'ll have to come down to their level to deal with
them, and low \'n\' slow the Mig\'s will chew it up. Don\'t even _talk_
about 1-100 odds.

Arty, so long as they have decent support from air attack; definitely. A
TL-12 arty batallion is going to be _very_ deadly.

If you have a TL-3 world...why are the offworlders bothering with you?
If they invade, you have no choice but to surrender. Wait \'till they get

Suppose that the Roswell UFO _was_ a starship of some sort, but _wasn\'t_
in good enough shape to reverse-engineer?  If one stipulates that the
ship\'s existence would be enough of a hint that _some_ kind of FTL drive
was possible, would this taint the Solomani claim to being a Major Race?

Eban Emamanuel would have been paratrooper proof had the defenders
thought to put machine guns covering the top of the fortress. The
Germans couldn\'t get into the fortress with the weapons they carried,
although they were able to disable some of the weapons of the
fortress.

By specialized sapper troops using flamethrowers and heavy demolition

The German army was a mobile army; a coast to coast defense like the
Maginot Line would have stopped it in its tracks. France\'s problem was
they expected Belgium to fortify their border as well, but the smaller
country couldn\'t afford it. France didn\'t want to fortify Belgium\'s
border, as that would have looked like they were writing off their
smaller neighbor.

Well, as someone who doesnt\' believe in tamperproof transponders
or that they would work for ID a ship as legel or illegal, I
think transponders would be required based on port traffic.
If the port of busy enough, _any_ ship landing needs a transponder
to avoid them running in to each other.  If you have too
many ships to keep track of, then you have too many to land
and some have to go around.  Now, since they don\'t have
to land at a star port, a lot of space ships will divert to
small ports just to save time.

Which is, of course, an excellent argument for fixing the sensor rules ;).  To
be honest, GT severely overestimates the ease of hitting something with a
missile, particularly a blind operator-guided missile at long ranges....

Only if the Navigator screwed up and did not give you the correct orbital
vector.

When you appear, you should have approximately the same orbital speed as the
planet you are going to approach.  But I imagine that a standard emergence
point for a given system would be *behind* orbit of the planet, as an added
precaution.  (Piracy advocates take notice.  A \'Standard\' emergence point
for a given system?)

Considering how many centuries after roswell it took for the solomani to hit

You\'re thinking of the Sack of Gashikan.  A Vargr corsair band
raided the garden planet of Gashikan (in Gashikan sector), and
used near-planetbuster nukes on it - global holocaust to the
human society there.  It sparked the Vargr Race Wars, and has had
repercussions in the area right up to the time of the Rebellion
and Collapse.  (Repercussions include widespread slavery and
attempted genocide via multiple means including tailored
biological weapons; indirectly also the fully-integrated biracial
culture on Asimikigir in the Protectorate.  See the summary
writeup in GALACTIC 2.4 [Amdukan and Gashikan sectors].)

OK, let\'s look at history.

The Roswell Incident was in 1947.  Terra was at TL6, about the middle of the 
period.  Jump-1 comes availiable at TL9.

The date given for the First Interstellar War is 2113 AD (ref: Supp 8, Library 
Data A-M).  That\'s 166 years after Roswell.  According to pg 6 of Supp 8, the 
first Terran jump drives were in common use in \'the late 21st Century\'.  Their 
introduction was about, say, 2070.  That\'s only 123 years to climb *3 full 
tech levels*!!!!!

FWIW, this opens the door for the *possibility* that the Roswell Incident 
*did* make a difference in Terra\'s developement.  After all, of the 430-odd 
known races, only *5* discovered jump drive on their own.  (The Aslans copied 
it, which we know for *sure*.)  This suggests to me that developement of jump 
drive depends on several factors:  ready access to lanthanum, a high enough 
tech level to allow developement of jump drive *theory*, and a goodly amount 
of *pure luck*.  There have been a few Minor Races that were starfarers using 
STL \'slowboats\', even carving out small pocket empires with generation ships.  
IINM, these proto-TL10 cultures *also* had a good understanding of gravitics 
theory.  Why did they *not* develope jump drive on their own?

I\'ve been grinding that idea through the back of my head for a couple weeks now, that the Roswell UFO was really an off-course Vilani free trader, and the wreck was in good enough shape that the Americans developed jump drive from it.  Kind of what happened with the Aslan, remember?

Considering the speed that Terra went from TL6 to TL9 with FTL (under 150
years), I\'d say this was highly likely.  We know that the Vilani had ventured
into the Solomani Rim sector somewhat, and their traders even made it as far as
the Dark Nebula, IIRC.  It\'s *definitely* in the realms of possibility.  We
know the Solomani couldn\'tve recieved jump drive from the Aslan; the Aslan
recieved it from the Solomani.  I don\'t know what the Hivers were doing during
this period, but as of 1100, their border was within a sector or so of Terra.

Interesting speculations, eh?

This is true, btw, also in TNE, there is a passage about the Virus &
"Expert Systems" in missile guidance...

But, in the case of GURPs, well, I would have to say that it should be
added if not there, or else how can one do the AIM-7, AIM-9, & AIM-120?

Makes it easier to put on a wargame table, anyway.

Just make sure you can maintain the stuff and get in necessary spares, or
you\'ll end up like Iran, all those F-14s rotting for lack of good parts
and maintainance

Probably three. One down for maintainance, one in use, with the third one 
supposed to be in use but waiting for the next TL12 spark plug to arrive
by mail order. Seriously, it\'s general military practice that you need one
or two spare vehicles for each one you want to maintain, continously, in
the field. Higher TL vehicles *may* be more reliable, though.

Well, the one thing you have to remember is that many planets have a
counter-insurgency problem even if they are not balkanized. The
insurgents, unless aided by some off world interests, may not have access
to much high tech gear if the government can strictly control space. So an
actual low-TL force can be useful in addition to any police forces you
have.

Depends. If the native tanks are TL6 clunkers at 20 mph and you have ten
TL12 600 mph grav tanks... remember, technology enhances mobility as well
as firepower. It can also make supplies easier depending on what you use
for power and weaponry. If you yell "ready, set go" by the time his tanks
have made it 100 miles into your border territory, half your tanks have
toasted his supply convoys and the other half are hovering over your
capital toasting your goverment buildings...

Heh. Seriously, a high-low mix is probably a good idea, for the same
reason the US didn\'t buy all F-16s. Still, the designs I\'ve seen from
striker and gurps vehicles both suggest that high end grav armor is really
something else. With no need to bother with long range sensors or life
support, a grav tank in atmosphere can beat an SDB the same way an SDB can
beat a  starship.

Of course, that argument is interesting since it is based on difference of
about half a TL, or at most mid TL7 to early TL8. The better argument
would be 300 Sopwith Camels against three F-22s - or perhaps more useful, 
three A-10 Thunderbolts. Or more to the point, for TL6 vs. TL12
equivelents, three M-1 Abrams against 300 of Ziska\'s war-wagons.

John Keegan, in his recent book on North American battles, remarks that
the personal bodyguard (a half dozen men with M16s) of the Nato general he
was visiting with could have been decisive at Waterloo...

I think the Aslan have pretty well proved that "Major Race" status is

F-16 is gone. Unless the 16 can stand off and take them all out with
long range missiles, it\'ll have to come down to their level to deal with
them, and low \'n\' slow the Mig\'s will chew it up. Don\'t even _talk_
about 1-100 odds.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'m not talking F-16 vs Mig-17, I\'m more talking F-16 vs Misubishi Zero.

TL-12 vs TL-6, the TL-6 craft will literally never see what kills them.
If they\'re killed with energy weapons fire, the TL12 baddie won\'t even
have to reload. We\'re not talking a one level tech difference here.

Add that, as with the tanks, nothing the TL-6 craft can carry will even
dent the TL-12 craft - unless you\'re deploying Genies or something.
Thunderballs change the whole equation.

My scenario included purchase of maintenance equipment - I wouldn\'t

You mess with the TL-12 grav tanks, your country won\'t have a long
term, btw.

Add to it than any assault against a fixed position means you have
to put your units where the grav tanks can find them - it might take
two grav tanks to kill anything that comes in sight of the starport.
Better plan on being sneaky, and be prepared to lose every city
you own in the process.

One TL-12 grav tank vs one TL-6 city would make Godzilla envious.

I\'m not talking incompetent, I\'m talking incapable. Try your ten thousand

Take another look at the Zeros vs F-14\'s dogfight in _Final Countdown_.
That was with a two level tech difference - we\'re talking six here.

Instead of trying to convert ships over to GURPS Traveller by design, 
do it by function, building the best ship under that design system
for the purpose, instead of limiting the ship classes arbitrarily based
on their original designs.

This goes for PC ships as well as ships of the line - design around
function, and avoid "copying" old CT/MT/TNE/T4 designs.

Side note: anyone working on a Trillion Credit Squadron/Pocket Empires
book for G:T?  With the "mass combat system" in GURPS, that sort of thing
could really be done on a serious scale...  whole Frontier Wars could
be fought easily under such a system...

(Anyone silly enough to consider such?  I\'ll tag along as the idea guy

And the mercs are working under the limitation of *NO* resupply.  And those 
*weren\'t* M16\'s, they were FN-FAL\'s.  A *MUCH* superior rifle.

You don\'t have to search a 1AU sphere, though. All you need to patrol and
search is the 100 dia limit around your homeworld (unless you are using the
stellar 100 dia. border as your jump limit), and this can be readily
covered by 4-8 vessels even if the world has a size of \'A\'.

languages other than English for naming things, especially starports and
corporations. 

It occurs to me that TML members speak a wide variety of languages, and
many of us might find uses for a multilingual lexicon of a few Traveller
terms. Perhaps we might ask TMLers who speak languages other than English
to provide translations for the following terms...

Spaceport
Starport
Highport
Downport
Base
Company
Corporation
   etc?

Also, words for governmental bodies, ie:

Assembly
Parliament
Legislature
Council
Bureau
Administration
   etc.

(Usage examples would be helpful, too...)

Traveller GMs could then combine these terms with proper nouns, adjectives,
whatever (easily found in dictionaries) to produce plausible names for
ports, corporations, governmental bodies, etc. Thus, we might be able to
get away from a universe full of worlds settled by English speakers, as
suggested by names like, say, "Cornwallis Downport".

Certainly, inventing names in foreign languages can be iffy, and the
results will often be technically wrong. Fortunately, the game takes place
thousands of years in the future, so one can always blame linguistic drift.

  I\'d have guessed yes, partly for local economic and political purposes

  The Imperium can provide that defense far more easily, although
it is reassuring to be told that the support and basing of vastly
higher tech formations is trivial and common - this makes SDB or
fighter basing much simpler for internal security uses.

  I suspect you may find that planetary funded SDB\'s are effectively

  I\'d love to see the articles of incorporation for that concern :>  If they
have that kind of cash available I don\'t see why they don\'t simply set up

  If the ship isn\'t registered it can survive only very briefly in Imperial
(or Sword World, or Zho...) space. Where did they build it?

  I\'m afraid that I\'m not conversant with MT ship design; what holds for HG

Not exactly masses, These were known as \'interval troops\', their job was
counter penetration, and counter infiltaration (all part of the grand plan
and would have made an an attack of the Ebn Emal forts impossible, although
the fact that the forts were mutually supporting, capable of resisting
their own fire, and simply shelled each other when the enemy got close
would (and did) put paid to any attacks against them.  The manpower
equation with Germany led to the Maginot line, it was a force multiplier,
nothing more, (France\'s losses in  WWI ensured that during the 40s it would
have far fewer men available for ,military service then Germany.)  The
maginot line succeded brilliantly in forcing the Germans to attack
elsewhere.  That \'Sickle cut\' rather than the Schlieffen plan was used (
remeber Huntziger wheeled to protect the flank of the maginot line), that
the Belgiums did not co-operate until war beagn, and a million other
reasons led to France\'s downfall.

That the TL 15 armoured units can make mincemeat of Tl 5 fortifications is
not half as interesting as considereing the case where the TL are the same.

Cool. So out hypothetical 1 billion taxpayers are paying 3 credits apiece
on the salary budget.

Add another 3 credits each for equipment maintainence, and a credit for
friction.

I use Australia as an example. About 20 million citizens. We have (from
memory) five working submarines, half a dozen frigates, a couple of
obsolete destroyers, seventy odd F18s, about 20 F111s plus I think a dozen
P3 Orion patrol craft.

In interstellar terms, that would turn into five SDBs, half a dozen
Escorts, a couple of obsolete Colonial Cruisers, seventy odd small
fighters, twenty big fighters and a dozen type S scouts.

This is about right for a small world - about 10 000 ton of military
shipping for about 20 million people. Call it KCr 100 a year per dton in
maintainence ... about a gigacredit a year. Maintainence could be higher
with \'bleeding edge\' technology, lower for centuries-proven designs.

Fifty credits a head for twenty million citizens. Could be a bit on the
high side, but it\'s a pretty decent flotilla ... easily justifiable for 100
million people.

The navy doesnt have to be that big to make piracy in and around mainworlds

One problem is can the sub-craft trust the mothership not to bug out ?

issue.

So cargos are in the range of KCr 10-40 per dton ? Therefore, how many does

Check with your local insurance company on insurance costs. I think about
5% of ship value per annum sounds about right for Free Traders ... that
will turn into more than several megacredits per year.

Now I\'d hate (that really is a huge understatement) for the Roswell/UFO/X-files 
conspiracy theories to become canon and I hate that DGP spelt out that the 
Aslan copied jump drive from the Solomani (I think at the most they should 
have restricted themselves to subtle hints so that individual referees could

more than a few really fun senarios here. So.......

Howsabout this. Large scale radio transmissions began on Earth in the early

Kevin Smith is way too cute (IMHO) to "realistically" portray Lucan.

Most of the people you are suggesting are too attractive, too buff, &
too young for the roles you have suggested.  Take a look at the picture
of Lucan in MT\'s Rebellion Sourcebook (pg 45, Liz Danforth art).

Lucan is an average (or less if you notice that his beard serves to hide
his week chin & that the lines on his face show greater aging than you
would expect from someone his age, born 1088, is typical) looking,
intense individual who (if the puffyness of his face is any indication)
is a bit on the chubby side.

Does anyone know (canonically) if Lucan and Varian were identical of
fraternal twins?  They look very similar in the illo on pg 9 on Rebllion
SB but you can\'t see Varians face. If they were identical twins we can
use the same actor for Varian in his pre death scenes.

Note that in this illustration Lucan is wearing high heels & mascara
(you can see it running from his tears), notice also how he is portrayed
as wearing significantly more juwelry than his brother (at least 4 rings
& a rather elaborate & a large, apparently bejewled, chest piece. 

While dress standards in the far future will be different from those we
expect now this is, after all, a piece of art intended to be scene by a
twentieth century audience.  As such the notion of a man in high heals,
mascara, & jewely who is crying seems intended to suggest, by using
unflattering stereotypes (to put it mildly) that Lucan is perhaps not
the most heterosexual person out there. ( text evidence in the form of
Windhooks version of the story is at the time of Varian\'s death Lucan &
Varian were arguing because Elia had "decided to leave Lucan and become
Varian\'s female aquaintance".  Note that this version does not
necessarily imply that Lucan and Elia were intimate).  

As for Strephon I always pictured him as having an aura of gravitas &
presence to him.  Perhaps a 50 something Charleton Heston?

No everybody knows that the reason the Aslan are on the coyns is that
when Grandfather created the coyns he used CT Alien modules to pick his

Darrian) that these books covered on one conyn.)   :)

Well, then in that case I\'m just going to make it IMC.  I happen to like a

ICs can\'t last that long. They depend on junctions between P-type and
N-type material. Over 50,000 years the dopant atoms would diffuse
across the junction, rendering it useless. I doubt that the "Liquid
Crystals" in LCD displays are stable over such periods, and I suspect
that the fluid they are suspended in would leak out long before. 

LEDs depend on junctions, so they\'d suffere the same fate as ICs. 

Batteries aren\'t stable over such time spans either. They\'d no longer
be rechargeable after as little as a *decade*. 

And BTW, how did he determine the voltage and *polarity* required for
the recharger? Get the polarity wrong, and you\'ll ruin anything that
wasn\'t already. If you get the voltage too high, you\'ll also ruin
things.

OK, so the Aslan got jump drive from the Solomani, the Solomani got jump
drive from the Vilani.

It\'s got to be within the realm of possibility (as Pratchett might say: at
one end of the probability curve at least), that *none* of the "major"
races actually developed jump drives themselves.

Anyone any bright ideas what to do about the coyns in that case?

I guess that would be me.  If anyone knows where the list originates I\'d be
interested.  It\'s an 18 page, two column list of (classic) Traveller terms
and their German counterparts.  The copy I\'ve seen has a handwritten
\'Zuber\' at the top which I would guess is a reference to Siegfried Zuber
who translated some of the Traveller books into German (Safarischiff,
Roboter, Brennpunkt Bowman, etc.).  I assume it may have been a handlist to

It certainly isn\'t a recent thing.  \'Early dot-matrix\' would be my guess.

I must confess that this is one reason I haunt old second hand bookshops as
they are an excellent source of dictionaries and grammar books that serve
really well in this sort of situation.  It doesn\'t have to *be* right
(unless of course you happen to have say, a Finn or a Hausa speaker playing
with you), but just *looking* right can be a great aid.  And as you say,
linguistic drift is a great excuse. (Not that I\'d discourage aiming for
correctness...)  Of course for the really persevering PC types, it can be a
great source of clues as well.

Besides, a shelf of 50 odd language dictionaries/grammars/phrase books is a
great conversation starter!  (And you never know what language the
conversation might be in.)

If the pirate is at 1 AU, how is it going to intercept merchant ships
jumping
out at 100 diameters (800,000 miles, less than 0.01 AU)? It\'ll take a 1-G
merchant only a few hours to go from the surface to 100 diameters; the
pirate
will never even get into weapons range.
****************
Well......using GT rules and assuming a size 8 world...100 diamiters is 80
hexes.

An orbital command bridge can pick up an unstealthed 400dt ship at 71-100
hexes (assuming skill 16 or a computer running skill 16) on a six or
less...this is per turn(20 min) if the pirate lurks any time at all, he
will be picked up and once he is detected they only need a 10 or less to
keep a lock on him.   this is with just one fort. multiple forts will
greatly increase the odds.  the forts could either send out a patrol to
check on the blip, of if they are *really* parinoid they could launch a
spread of missiles.  :)

At 1 G a ship cam move from rest relative to the planet on the limit to
close orbit in 17 turns(just under 6 hours)

That means a raider could match velocities and cripple the ship, but if the
are any defenses to speak of they will have plenty of time to get involved.



(I can\'t believe I\'m entering into a piracy debate...)
************
me either :)

If the pirate *is* lurking close enough to catch merchants, a big military
sensor array will probably detect it - space is very dark, IR emissions
from
warm objects are surprisingly easy to see - unless it has its power plant
completely shut down and has very good thermal masking. Take a look at my
sensor rules and FFS2...It\'s very unlikely even with this that one could
hide from the very large military arrays a high-pop high-TL world would
have
if you were as close as 100 diameters; you still need some power for life
support, and hence will have some IR emissions.
*************
Or even look at the GT rules....Same thing goes...


My personal take is that if you *really* want piracy, you should move the
100-diameter limit out to ~10 million miles instead...
*****************
I agree...push the limit back to 1000 diamiters, much better odds for
piracy. and if you keep the limit for leaving to 100 diamiters they have a
zone of operations in between, they can bag the merchies and then jump away
instead of scrambling for the limit.

BTW how long does it take to tranship cargo?

I\'ve lived in Alicante four years. The "fort" is up on a hill, not 
really close to the port (although you can see it from there). So, 
maybe it does not qualify as a naval base....

That\'s why TCS limits your fleet to 10 times your annual budget. Once you
have that many, you can\'t afford to build any more because all your money
goes to maintain the ones your already have. BTW. you did notice that I
said that the _Rebellion_ navy only comes to 34% of the budget the _Striker_
rules gives, didn\'t you? 

>10% of the cost of the ships would pay for maintainence and maybe crew
>saleries but I doubt that.

That\'s what the rules say, and as far as I am concerned, they are shooting
high. Annual maintenance comes to 1% of the annual maintenance budget, and
crew salaries comes to about 2.5%. There remains 96.5% to pay for the
support structure.

All included in the figure according to the rules.

Perhaps the proportion of crew to hardware is different in a wet navy? You
have about one crewmember per MCr20 worth of ship in Traveller space navies.

Dammit Charles, READ WHAT I WRITE! _If the pirate is in a position to
intercept a ship that jumps into the system_  And, please, when you propose
something, take a few minutes to do the numbers and reality check it! In 
this case, figure out how close to the 100 diameter limit a pirate has to
be in order to chase down an incoming merchant before it can reach to safety
and then figure out how to hide it there. It can\'t be done if the defenders
have a few military grade sensor arrays available. (And as I have repeatedly
admitted, if a place has NO defenses, a pirate can just jump in and help
himself).

I\'ve just been struck with an idea for another milieu, The Fourth 
Imperium, or ROM2.

Starting, oh, about 2000 or so (using the 3I calender), it is the result 
of vigorous expansion of Terrans to fill in the void left by the 
Rebellion and Virus.  A couple of conditions.

1)  Virus has left the Terrans with a bad taste for high automation.  As 
such ships typically have higher crew requirements.

2)  Psionics are in use, though not common among people.  The 4th Imp 
makes serious use of \'psi cops\' and in military uses.  This is _NOT_ a 
kinder, gentler Imperium.  Psi is also used for system interfaces, as to 
help prevent a recurrence of the Virus incident.  

3)  The 4I is still expanding beyond the old Solomani Rim sector, using 
both economic and military aggression.

4)  I\'m not sure what to do with the alien races, I\'d love some comments 
on that.

5)  The 4I rules like the 3I, but with a firmer grip, using hand picked 
governors and viceroys.  The psi cops make this easier.

6)  Not sure what to do about the Zho\'s.

7)  The 4I uses high tech, TL 17, but tries to limit subject worlds to 
no more than TL 12 or so.

Anyone, please respond with ideas.

Thanks in advance.

Do the numbers. Military ships in Traveller do not need that many crew, and
most Traveller designs are not \'bleeding edge\' technology, as most modern
first-world ships are (incidentally, if crew have a major effect on
efficiency, then highly skilled crew should get paid more, a *lot* more,
than the upper ranges usually floated around. If a Ship Tactics-5 captain
is equivalent to MCr 50 of weapons upgrade, then that captain should be
able to ask for, and get, a salary of at least a megacredit a year when her
skills make a difference).

I can imagine most internal security forces lagging the \'state of the art\'
by 1 or 2 TLs ... not modern enough to go in line of battle, but still
better than armed merchants and similar auxiliaries.

If a ship costs n% in maintainence etc per year, then you will eventually
build up to a fleet size of 100/n. It might take a while to build up your
capital stock if 90% of your budget goes to recurrent maintainence of the
capital stock, but you will get there eventually.

Note that pre-20th century warships had much longer operational lives than
20th century ships, and that WW2 cruisers were still part of third-world
fleets until quite recently.

The other thing to remember is if the Navy has to pay x% for maintainence
etc then pirates should have to pay some fraction of x as well, or
presumably risk lower efficiency, more breakdowns and higher misjump chances.

Yes, but the pirates have to come within the defended sphere, because that
is where the merchant ships are.

Lets see. At work, I drill down to individual transaction level, in a
database dealing with 800 000 clients, about 500 000 employer records and
300 brokers with 1400 contracts dealing with those clients and employers.

And I can do it in very close to real time.

If an emergency hits, and it has to be done in real time, I can do it in
real time, or close enough that makes no odds (circa one hour lag).

You can outrun the immediate local defenses, but what about the attention

The difference is whether you are at the bottom or the top of the Subsector
Vice-Admiral\'s in tray. Grabbing a couple of freighters in what may well be
an insurance scam might get lost in the blizzard of paper. Using nukes wont.

Actually, one of the greatest obstacles to reaching a consensus on the
piracy issue is that the size of the merchant navy and other civillian
ships is not defined anywhere. The closest I have come is the description
of the merchant fleet in Aramis subsector form _The Traveller Adventure_.
Based on that the merchant fleet is nowhere near the size of the IN. But
then, Aramis is supposed to be a bit of a backwater. Abd the intersystem
traffic is not quantified anywhere.

>the traffic too and from jump point.

Not that much more. Jump ships are actually more economic than boats for
a lot of intrasystem travel. If travel time exceeds a week then jumping is
faster and if it exceeds a few days more (I haven\'t calculated the exact
breakeven point) then it is also cheaper (the time saved outweighing the
added cost of the jump drive and the lower cargo capacity).

The bigger and more elaborate your setup is, the more cargoes you have to
capture to make it worth while. I have yet to see a plausible setup worked
out in details. The big problem is that the various proportions are
different than they are for sea travel. You can spot other ships at
relatively greater distances and the number of places a defender has to
defend is much fewer. And, of course, there are no places for a pirate to
lurk. An appropiate analogy would be sea travel on a world where ships
could teleport from just outside one harbor to just outside another.

Steven was pointing out (for the umpteenth time) that the more expensive
the hardware a pirate needs to perform his job, the more cargoes he has
to capture to break even. Where did he get the nukes and how much did he
have to pay for them?

>Yes...again, I am not attempting to argue this from a canonical point of view.

So when I say that IMO the rules don\'t allow pirates and you say that if you
change the rules they do, we basically agree?

Don\'t you think that "Jump Point Zed" would be chosen with a view to
minimizing the transit time to the planet? But the real problem, once more,
is that if ships arrive at random points, then the pirate can\'t lurk at
the 100 diameter limit without arousing suspicion, and even if he could, he
couldn\'t be sure that any ships would arrive close enough for him to
intercept.
 
>My point was that there will be recommended shipping lanes, and

>Not all of these strayings will have criminal intent.

And my point is that a pirate is pissing away money every minute his ship
isn\'t earning anything. If the odds of catching someone who is off the
normal shipping lane are so low that he loses more money in the time he
waits than the cargoes he capture is worth, then his activity is not
economically sound.

Not quite what I ment.  I ment that he jumps in at a distant part of the
system to hide his jumo signature and then coasts to target range with his
preprogramed delta V.

IR emission are in the \'light\' part of the EM spectrum.  \'Large arrays\' are
used to pick up radio waves which are much farther down in the EM spectrum.
To do a IR search is little different than doing a visual search you just
use a slightly different telescope.  As for IR masking all heat radiated
into space is in the form of IR light as convection and conduction are not
posible into a vaccum.  The soultion is to radiate in only one dirrection,
aft.  With the front of the ship cold and facing the detecters if will fall
below the treshold of \'visability\' whil the heat is shown out the back like
a flashlight.  Sence it is a vaccume there are no reradiaters to give the
ships position away.  Todays military subs use a blending method to do the
same thing to hide their IR signature.  They have a harder time do to the
conductive and convective media of water.

I had not thought of that.  I guess it really does come down to the way the
gm interprets the TU.  If the Empire is strong and opressive little priracy.
If the EMpire is laso-fare then piracy is a local problem and more
prevailent.  It seams that a great deal of the debate on this list depend on
your assumtions (or interpretations) of the nature of the central government
behavior.  This is at the heart of the piracy debate and the transponder
debate and probably most other debates as well.

How many of those did Austalia pay to build as apposed to just maintaining?
How many of those 20 million are producers?  How may are dependants?  You
have to look at the cost to the producers as a percentage of disposable
income.  Taxes have to come out of the part of the producers income that he

Use multiple craft.  One for the cargo and the others to keep the locals
busy or take a pot shot at the planet with missles.  The SDB would have to
choose between a city being bombed and a pirate getting away with cargo that

Say he get 1 haul of 100tons worth 100kcr per ton.  That 10Mcr!  And I think
there would have to be more high than 100kcr per ton loads on long jump
routes.  Corador would be heavy with specialty high credit loads and armed
merchant to carry them so you have a trade off of high risk to high profit.
I can not see any cargo with a final sale price of less than 4kcr per ton
per jump being suficiently profitable to attact busness.  Companies do not
normal support operation with low proffit margins unless the volume of sales
is very high.  Like gasoline sales in the US.  VERY high volume but low
proffit for the retainer compared to other goods.  It all come down to
return on investment.  How many credit will you get for your investment. 2
to 1 in wholesale/retail per transaction is ok.  Maufacturer make twice what
it cost him to make, the wholesaler make twice what it cost him and the
retailer makes twice what it cost him.  This breaks down when the item cost
is high compared to it\'s expected utility but a 20% proffet on a
multimillion dollar item is not bad.  And yes a 500 dollar VCR does cost 50
to 80 dollars to make in 10000+ lots. Where do you think those clerance sale
prices come from?  They are selling near cost to clear their floor space for
more proffitable items.

Dropout reaches unexceptable levels in as little as 5 years for some types
of electronic parts.  Storage condition effect the shelf life of electronic

Any deginer worth the name will either key the recharger so it can not be
put in backwards or design in a safety circuit to protect the device from
reverse bias or both.  This applies only to comsummer goods though.  For
equipment that is normally only serviced by experts such precautions are
left out to save cost.  A pocket computer will have a keyed recharger.  A
jump drive\'s power connections will be plainly marked but otherwise not
protected.  A car battery is plainly marked (at least when new) but there is
nothing like a physical key to prevent you from hooking up your jumper
cables backwards.

Figuring out the type of power a discharged and unmarked battery would want
would be a real pain.  It\'s doable if you have enough to destroy a few in
the experimenting.  I wouldn\'t want to predict what a precussor artifact
would do if improperly recharged.  They could be using rechargeable
antimatter bateries for all a PC could know. (BIG GRIN and even bigger BANG!)

Assumting the the planet is 5000 mile in diameter.  Then 100 dias. is a
sphere 505,000 miles in diameter.  Surface area = 4 pi r squared. r =
252,500 miles.  Surface area = 801,184,666,481.7 square miles. 801 billion
square miles and you say you can actively scan this area with 4-8 vessels
looking for a 100 meter object?  Even with 8 ships that 100 billion square
miles.  What exactly are you using to scan this area?  Lidar is the best
candidate.  As scan rate increases signal return strength decreases by the
square of the change plus returned signal strengh is reduce by 4 for each
doubling of signal travel distance.  Not to mention propagation delay
problems and space junk blind spots.  I find it very hard to believe that
any one ship can maitain survelence on 100billion square miles of space and
that is just the 100 diameter shell much less all the space beyond it the a
pirate could be in.

Well, maybe I\'ve made a mistake in my calculations. It\'s happened before.

First of all, an average sector has 400 worlds, so we\'re already down to
25% ;-).

AN ANALYSIS OF THE IMPERIAL NAVY IN THE CLASSIC ERA
===================================================

Main sources: _Fighting Ships_, _Spinward Marches Campaign_ and _Rebellion_.

NUMBER AND TYPE OF SHIPS

_Rebellion_ p. 27 states that each sector of the Imperium theoretically has a
group of fleets numbering about 1000 ships. This number includes combat vessels
such as cruisers, carriers, battleships, and _some_ escorts (emphasis mine).
It does not include auxiliaries, support ships, and scouts.

The first ambiguity lies in just what kinds of escorts are included in the 1000
ship figure and what kinds are not. Are the 5,000 T _Sloan_ class escorts so
big that they are counted, or is there a class of escorts smaller than a
light cruiser (30,000 T ships), but bigger than Sloans?

One could postulate an escort class of around 10-20,000 T, big enough to mount
a spinal weapon, but too light to be classed as even a light cruiser. A bit
inelegant, especially since FS states that escorts are ships of up to 5000 T
and that the presence of a spinal mount is what distinguishes a cruiser, but
OTOH, are there really no ships in the 5,000-20,000 T range? And this way we
can define \'combat vessels\' as ships with spinal mounts and auxiliaries as
ships without. 

Perhaps escorts in BatRons and CruRons are not counted while escorts organized
into squadrons of their own (EscRons? ;-) are?

The simplest solution is propably to ignore the \',and some escorts\' part and
just consider the presence of a spinal mount the criteria for being part of
the 1000 ship figure.

The second ambiguity is whether battleriders are included in the figure or
not. I would have preferred that they were not, but the one detailed squadron
I know of (the 154th Battle Rider Squadron described in SMC) clearly implies
that they are.
 
In the following for ease of reference I\'m going to use the word \'armada\'
about the sector fleets and reserve the word \'fleet\' for the sub-sector-sized
fleets that the armadas are composed of. Also \'combat vessels\' for the ships
included in the 1000 ship figure and \'auxiliaries\' for all the ships that
isn\'t.

If the 1000 ships are for a sector with a full sixteen sub-sectors, then the
average fleet has 1000/16 = 62.5 ships. Since there are 320 regular fleets in
the Imperium, the total of combat ships for the Imperium would be around
20,000.

Further down it is stated that a regular fleet has between 2 and 10 squadrons
amounting to a total of between 50 and 200 ships. This would appear to average
out to 125 ships per fleet with an average of 6 squadrons per fleet and 21
ships per squadron.

Possibly this means that the squadrons are combat vessels _plus_ escorts and 
that the 125 ship figure includes auxiliaries. This would give us a navy of
20,000 combat vessels and a like number of auxiliaries.

However, FS states that CruRons are generally of 4 to 8 ships and the examples
in it implies that 8 ship BatRons are the norm. (Also, I seem to remember
squadrons of non-combat vessels mentioned somewhere, but I can\'t recall the
references).

Possibly the 2-squadron fleets and 25-ship squadrons are rare and almost all
fleets have 8-10 squadrons with almost all squadrons running to between 8 and
20 ships (half combat vessels and half escorts). With an average of about 9
squadrons per fleet and 14 ships per squadron we\'ll get about 20,000 combat
vessels and the same number of escorts. This still leave the pure auxiliary
squadrons like tanker squadrons and patrol squadrons (PatRons ;-) unaccounted
for, but it\'s a start.

SIZE AND COST OF A SQUADRON

The 154th Battle Squadron detailed in SMC consists of:

  1 300,000 T _Lurenti_ Class Carrier @ MCr23,056         =  23,056
  7 20,000 T _Nolikian_ Class Battle Riders @ MCr9,268.25 =  64,878
200 50 T _Sylean_ Class Heavy Fighters @ MCr105.33        =  21,066
  7 5,000 T _Sloan_ Class Escorts @ MCr3,334.5            =  23,342 
  
A total of MCr132,342 of which MCr109,000 goes to the combat vessels and the
remaining 17.6% goes to the escorts.

Obviously this must be one of the cheapest squadrons in the navy. If all the
20,000 combat ships cost around MCr19,000 (including the cost of its pendant
auxiliary) then the total cost of the regular Imperial navy would be TCr380.
This would represent 15% of the Imperium\'s total military investment, which
would make the whole shebang cost TCr2,533. Annual maintenance would run to
TCr254. Divided by the 15 trillion inhabitants of the Imperium that would be
Cr17 per man.

If we assume that the ships in FS constitutes a representative sample, then
we see that the average cruiser/carrier is of 52,714 T and costs MCr31,193.
If we reduce that to 50,000 T and add the cost of a 5,000 T escort apiece,
the average cruiser works out at roughly MCr33,000. The three battleships
average 300,000 T and costs MCr206,106 apiece, which with the escort and a
little rounding comes to MCr210,000.

Unfortunately, that just isn\'t enough. Even if we assume that ALL the combat
ships are battleships, it still only amounts to a total cost of TCr4,200,
which works out at a military budget of Cr187 per inhabitant of the Imperium.
If we assume a ratio of battleships to cruisers similar to the one in FS
(3:7), the the cost falls to TCr1723, or Cr77 per inhabitant.

Of course, we might say that we still haven\'t accounted for most of the
auxiliary ships yet. We\'ve included one 5,000 T escort for each combat ship,
but what about the couriers, destroyers, smaller escorts, transports and
tankers that appear in FS and elsewhere? For example, I happen to believe that
a navy would have a massive number of couriers, say 20 per fleet, but even
6400 couriers only amount to another 1.6 TCr. The same would apply to
destroyers and the like -- you need a huge number of them to affect the budget
noticeably. Some of the other auxiliaries like tankers would cost more
individually -- the milion T _Gorodish_ class fleet tenders mentioned in FS
might run to MCr400,000 apiece, but how many of those are the average fleet
likely to have? One? Two? OK, that\'s another 256 TCr, which is a help, but it
still leaves a long way to go. Remember that every credit we increase the
budget with represents another 3000 destroyers (just to pick an example), and
we know from the recent pirate debate that the Imperium apparently lack the
small ships to police all its member worlds adequately. So we may push the
budget up to Cr85/man by use of the smaller fry, but not much more than that.

There are two more possibilities that I can see. One is that battleriders are
NOT, after all, included in the 1000 ship figure. If a carrier and half a
dozen dreadnaught-sized battleriders counted as one ship instead of 6, then
we could get some really expensive ships. Unfortunately battleriders tend to
be cruiser-sized. The carrier needed to carry 6 200,000 T battleriders would
have to be about 2-2.5 million tons and the maximum size of a ship in CT is
1 million. A 1 million T carrier would only amount to about twice the cost
of the average battleship (MCr430) and according to FS the 500,000 T
_Tigress_ class dreadnaught is the largest ship in the Spinward Marches. A
500,000 T carrier would cost about the same as an average dreadnaught, which
leaves us back where we started.

The other possibility is that a large number of ships are laid up in
ordinary. That would require that part of the annual budget was used to
maintain these inactive ships, which would make the active part of the navy
a correspondingly smaller share. If we assume that the wartime budget of the
Imperium is 1.5 times the peacetime budget (a guesstimate based on the
various government multipliers in TCS) and that there would be enough ships
in ordinary to operate on the wartime budget, then there would be about one
ship in ordinary for each two active ships and about 6% of the budget would
be spent on maintaning them. If instead we assume that peacetime spending is
the 3% of GNP that _Striker_ gives and wartime spending would be 15% of GNP
then the Imperium could have EIGHT ships in ordinary for each active ship and
spend 45% of its peacetime budget on maintaining them. That would push the
military spending up to about Cr150/citizen. Whether you like the idea of an
Imperial reserve fleet of 160,000 combat vessels is another matter. (There is
some small support for the notion in the fact that acording to _Arrival
Vengeance_ ships are still being reactivated in 1123, six years after the
beginning of the Rebellion, with at least two more years to go before they
are finished. OTOH it requires an implausibly long view to maintain reserves
that will take 8 years to activate...)

And in the end, even with the best will in the world it appears that the 
Imperial navy is only about half the size that it should be (Cr150 would be
1.5% of the GNP and we were calculating with 3%).

To those who would suggest that perhaps the Imperium feels so secure that it
is using even less than the standard 3% peacetime spending I\'d like to point
to the Solomani, Zhodani, and K\'Kree and suggest that it is rather implausible
that the Imperium would feel so secure.

I\'d like to finish off by re-emphasizing that all those ships, the 20,000 
combat vessels, the 20,000 big escorts and the unspecified number of lesser
ships only represent 15% of the Cr150. Another 15% goes to the subsector
fleets and the remaining 70% goes to planetary defenses, though admittedly
6-40% of that (4.2-28% of the total) would go to armies.

I\'ve made a stab at arriving at a slightly more exact figure for the Imperial
taxes available for the Classic Era fleet. I\'ve gone through Deneb Sector as
representative of a frontier sector and Massilia Sector as representative of
a core sector and noted down all the high-population planets and worked out
their contribution, turning everything into Crimp. The result was roughly
TCr350/subsector for Deneb (I didn\'t count the three almost empty subsectors)
and roughly TCr550/subsector for Massilia. Taking the average, TCr450, and
multiplying by the number of subsectors in the Imperium (about 300) I get a
yearly GWP of TCr135,000.

1% of that would be the Imperial cut of the military budget: TCr 1,350. Of
this half would go to the colonial fleets. The remainder, TCr675, corresponds
to a regular fleet worth TCr6,750.

So a war ship cost the same to maintain in peace time as in full combat

That maybe it.  A 2000MC carrier had a crew of 5000!  This months PS had an
artical on the economics of a Nimitz class carrier.  The 5000 does not count
air crews.  Cost to maintain the ship is more than 10% per year not counting
saleries.

I\'m sorry I was not more explicit.  100 dias. is the Minimum limit.  What is
the limit of navagational error?  How much breathing room does the ship
have?  Do they jump in at 110 dias?  200 dias?  If they give themselves some
slop then they will not be at the 100 diameter shell when they first arrive.

As for the pirate, he can hide nearly anywhere as lomg as he can beat the
SDB to the prize.  The 1 AU statement was that he could enter the system
behind and object like a moon a coast in quitely on Delta V.  To find him
running silent you have to search everywhere he could be.  His course could
pass close to known arrival points and he could grab a target of
oppertunity.  If he was expecting a particullar target he could plan his
course to put him in the best posible intercept position based on the slop
facter I mention before.

The problem as I see it is that pirates are canon so we are left to explaon
them as best we can with little information.  For the pirate to exist their
mush be crack for them to hide in.  The random incouter charts make them
seem fairly common as far as pirates can be common.  So it they do exit how
do they exits?  I see several posibilities.

1)  The number of military ships are low compared to the area they must
patrol.  Reasonable idea if the tax base could not support that large an IN.
(My vote for most likely sigle answer but I think it will take several of
these together.)

2)  Pirates can hide from sensor in system and jump out after they attack
with a reasonable chance for escape.

3)  The slop facter in jump navagation is large enough to give the pirate a
window of opertunity.  This slop would also limit the defence advantage of
convoys as they would be scattered some what it jump.

4)  There are so many merchant ships that the pirates have little trouble
picking a safe target and the SDB have trouble protecting all of them.

5)  Any other suggestions?

Pirates are canon people.  Instead of arguing the fact that they can not be
why don\'t we try to come up with a combination of facters that will explain
why they can be?

You have to admit that they spice up the TU.

ICs can\'t last that long. They depend on junctions between P-type and
N-type material. Over 50,000 years the dopant atoms would diffuse
across the junction, rendering it useless. I doubt that the "Liquid
Crystals" in LCD displays are stable over such periods, and I suspect
that the fluid they are suspended in would leak out long before.

LEDs depend on junctions, so they\'d suffere the same fate as ICs.

Batteries aren\'t stable over such time spans either. They\'d no longer
be rechargeable after as little as a *decade*.

And BTW, how did he determine the voltage and *polarity* required for
the recharger? Get the polarity wrong, and you\'ll ruin anything that
wasn\'t already. If you get the voltage too high, you\'ll also ruin
things.

I use Australia as an example. About 20 million citizens. We have (from
memory) five working submarines, half a dozen frigates, a couple of
obsolete destroyers, seventy odd F18s, about 20 F111s plus I think a dozen
P3 Orion patrol craft.
In interstellar terms, that would turn into five SDBs, half a dozen
Escorts, a couple of obsolete Colonial Cruisers,
**********************8
beg to differ...I suggest that they translate directly to a couple of
obsolete destroyers....

seventy odd small
fighters, twenty big fighters and a dozen type S scouts.
******************
or a dozen modular cutters with big sensor platforms on them.

but yeah,  that looks about right.:
5 SDBs
6 Fer-de-lance
a pair of 3-5000 DT destroyers from a TL or two back
70 ramparts
20 Strike Fighters
12 modular cutters with modules full of sensors.

there should be more...doesn\'t Australia have customs cutters or something?
SAR boats? ASW helicopters? so tack on:
2-4 Patrol Cruisers
40-50 assorted small craft (including 5-10 Gunned Gigs, and another 5-10
ships boats with cargo converted to sensors)

your anti piracy could work much like this:

Suppose your system mainworld is New Australia :)
There is a GG named Tasmania with colonies on some of the moons

The only systems within a few jump range are New New Zealand, In-the-Knees,
New New Guinea, Solomon\'s Planet, Bjorne, Canal, and Simone :)

Of these only N.N.Z. has high enough pop and Tech to do its own anti piracy
patrols.
you have postal union agreements with the high pop high tech worlds on the
other side though (Nippon New Hong Kong and Sing-pure)

Your Parliament wouldn\'t spring for those orbital forts you wanted, so you
use your cutters in shifts of 3 to get global coverage (shifts of 4 if you
use 3d combat) for your mainworld.

The ships boats can do the same for the gas giant.

You can use your fighters in groups of 4-6 for patrol sweeps, with the
strike fighters in groups of 2-4 for backup.

The SDB can either be used to search for intruders, or just to patrol your
spacelanes between the mainworld and the colonies/jumpoints.

Customs duties can be handled by the gunned gigs or even unarmed craft

Each of the DDs can be grouped with 3 DEs to go out and patrol other
systems between you and your trading partners. The PCs can do the same.  if
you have 4 PCs you can make 4 three ship groups
2 with DD and 2xDE
2 with DE and 2xPC

Keep one group at home each month, And the other three out on patrol.

when taking increased costs for space navies into account if you up the pop
from 5 to 7 it is still quite workable.

I think the best solution to keep piracy \'canon\' without changing a whole
bunch of stuff is to increase the incoming jump threshold to 1,000
diameters (or more) and keep the outgoing threshold where it is at 100
diameters

   Check out "The Day After Roswell" by Lt. Colonel Phillip J. Corso.  I
saw this on the new release shelf at Barnes & Noble a few months ago.
Personally, I\'m waiting for the paperback before I buy it. 
According to the dust jacket notes, Lt. Col. Corso, formerly of Army
Intelligence, asserts that a UFO did go down at Roswell in 1947.  The
government has been studying it and has leaked ideas to think tanks over
the years.  Ideas that have lead to things like silicon based computer
chips and fiber optic data transmission.

The gravity whorl of the primary screws up jump space for 1000 AU

100d from the biggest gravity source (the system primary). J-2 ships
can come out at either the J-1 point or the J-2 point (probably the 
biggest gas giant), and so on.

I\'ll also have ships coming out of jump space make the transition
as they pass the 100d limit of whatever jump point they\'re aiming
at, in a very rough straight line from where they left - you don\'t get
to choose what point on the sphere you enter, so the main world
can be on the other side of the sun when you show up.

Also, just for fun, I\'ll have the physics of jump space bleed your
ship\'s velocity so it enters realspace at rest with respect to the
gravity well that kicked you out.

The better your navigation solution, the closer your jump exit point
will be to a line drawn from where you are to the center of the gravity
well you\'re dropping out at. A clunky free trader with an old Model/1
computer will probably drop out anywhere within a 30 to 40 degree
perimeter, and may even drop a little short in response to gravimetric
disturbances along the route.

Jump exit will be a relatively calm affair, some energy signature
that you\'ll see if you\'re looking that way but not a big graviton
or energized hydrogen pulse that lights up boards all across the
system.

Jump-4 military ships can come out right at the main world\'s 100d
limit for some systems with this rule, but Free Traders will have
to fly in from the 100d of the primary, which may or may not be
near the orbital path of the main world.

This kind of environment - especially with limited detection ranges
as per CT and Mayday - should make the spacelanes a little more
interesting. Traders come in-system all over the place, the top of the
line ships (high jump merchants) can jump directly into the inner system,
the clunkers the PC\'s often drive have to fly through the outer system
on their inbound (and fuelless) leg. Pirates can hide, can potentially
even have a base in the outer system. System defense forces must
actually patrol instead of sip coffee dirtside until a satellite tells them
the exact location, vector and identity of every suspicious ship 
in the system.

Why the obvious, silly...Whenever another race discovers one of his
carefully seeded relic jump drives, and no one _catches_ them doing so,
Gramps just hops back in time, adds another coyn, and hops forward
again.

Why didn\'t he just hop back and keep himself from making all his

  ----Chet

From: "jim clem" <travmind@hotmail.com>

I\'ve just been struck with an idea for another milieu, The Fourth 
Imperium, or ROM2.

Starting, oh, about 2000 or so (using the 3I calender), it is the result 
of vigorous expansion of Terrans to fill in the void left by the 
Rebellion and Virus.  A couple of conditions.

1)  Virus has left the Terrans with a bad taste for high automation.  As 
such ships typically have higher crew requirements.

2)  Psionics are in use, though not common among people.  The 4th Imp 
makes serious use of \'psi cops\' and in military uses.  This is _NOT_ a 
kinder, gentler Imperium.  Psi is also used for system interfaces, as to 
help prevent a recurrence of the Virus incident.  

3)  The 4I is still expanding beyond the old Solomani Rim sector, using 
both economic and military aggression.

4)  I\'m not sure what to do with the alien races, I\'d love some comments 
on that.

5)  The 4I rules like the 3I, but with a firmer grip, using hand picked 
governors and viceroys.  The psi cops make this easier.

6)  Not sure what to do about the Zho\'s.

7)  The 4I uses high tech, TL 17, but tries to limit subject worlds to 
no more than TL 12 or so.

I am extraordinarily aware of what infrared radiation is, in as much as I am
a professional infrared astronomer, and did large amounts of modelling of
spacecraft emission for FFS2. The assumption in FFS2 (and early traveller
versions) is that while low-tech sensors (TL6-9) are telescopes with cameras,
by higher TLs they are interferometric arrays, the vis/IR equivalent of a
phased array, with each element coherently detecting incoming radiation and
assembling them into a sensor picture. (Hence the use of the word "array".) 
(This is a minor detail, of course; you can get similar effects with telescopes,
but it makes it easier to build arrays with 1000 m2 area.)

This is implicitly in the FFS2 model - even normal (non-masked) ships are
assumed to be radiating directionally enough that a sensor only sees about 
10% of the waste heat you\'d get if they were radiating isotropically. More
extreme masking helps you do this better and also includes equipment for
cooling the hull (you have to get the hull well below 200 K or you\'ll still
stand out quite sharply.) You also have to paint the hull very, very, very
black (better than 99.99%) to avoid being detected by reflected sunlight. 
And (in the Definitive Sensor Rules written to go with FFS2) you can do better
by (as you suggest) radiating all heat away from the sensor. However, that
only really works if the sensor is only in one direction. If there are 4-6
fixed sensor platforms out at 100 diameters, they\'ll see the pirate as it
goes by and enters the 100 diameter sphere...

Still, there might be soem combinations for which it works (a low-budget 
world in which the outer sensor platforms aren\'t very good, for 
example.) Take a look at FFS2 and the DSR; the modelling is good enough to
answer these questions quantitatively rather than qualitatively.

the laser and 2 G acell, the other loses the laser a computer and a
cremamber.
one of the free traders takes minor damage, with one turret lightly damaged
(still funtional) and depressurised (with 6 jackers killed).

in short the merchies aren\'t that great, but they can soak up lots of
damage due to their size.

Subject: [GT] Midu Agashaam class Destroyer
Here\'s my first attempt at a GT ship design. The only thing I\'m not sure of
(seeing that I\'m not an expert with GURPS) is whether the DR is high
enough,
and how to handle the Nuclear Damper.
Any mistakes are my own, of course...
For reference, here\'s the original high guard (which is what I\'m using):
DD-C246BJ2-052400-50506-0   3,000tons
            3     4 1 1        TL=15.
            3     4 1 1      Crew=33.
Two Cutters.
==============================================================
MIDU AGASHAAM class Destroyer (TL 12)

3,000-ton SL Hull, DR 1100, 6 turrets with three missile racks each, 8
turrets with three 405-MJ lasers each, 6 turrets with three sandcasters
each, 1 12,810-MJ particle accelerator bay, 4.86 meson screen (DR 1000),
*************
these are meant to be whole modules...5 modules give you DR
(20,800,000*5/105,00)990 not really much at all..the average damage at 4
hexes is 15,750 for a meson bay. so 8 hit on your ship unprotected vs 9
hits protectedif you make it 20 modules you can take 11 average hits and
you don\'t get a major damage roll from the first one.  perhaps consider
leaving it off if you can\'t give it more DR.

    'body' => 'Let us consider a moderate-population TL-12 world. It\'s main passive
sensor array might be a PEMS14.5 on an orbital station - MCr 5000 or so, 
1000 m2 area spread out over a 100-m-diameter ring. (PEMS14 for a lower-
population world, PEMS-15 for a higher population world.) It would probably
have several picket sensors or SDBs with PEMS-13.5 or so out at the 
100-diameter limit. 

A hypothetical 400-ton pirate with a Military Black hull (MCr 500 or so for
a spherical hull) and Advanced IR masking (I can\'t recall the price) would
have a visible-light signature of -1.5 and a IR signature at full power of 
- -0.5. At minimum power (a few megawatts) its IR signature would be about -1.5.

The 100-diameter limit is a range of 11.5; let\'s have the pirate lurk slightly
outside, at a range of about 12. The PEMS 14.5 main warning sensor will have
a visible-light signal of (14.5 - 12 - 1.5 = 1) at this range, an Average 
task every half hour to detect the pirate. (The IR signal is about the same.)
If the sensor operator isn\'t very alert (if no-one expects any
pirates) the task becomes a level or so harder.

About the only trick the pirate can use to make itself harder to detect
in the visible is being on the line of sight to the sun - worth -0.5 to 
signature, for
a signal of 0.5; a Staggering task every turn to be detected. It still won\'t
be able to hide from a competent operator for more than a few hours 
(especially since a competent operator will dedicate extra effor to scanning
the sun arc, spending a turn every few hours scanning only that arc for an
extra +0.5). If the sensor operator isn\'t alert the task is a diff level
harder, which may make it possible to hide for a day or so before the operator
gets lucky.

On the other hand, at a medium-low population world probably all one has to 
worry about is a PEMS-14 (MCr 500, which is also the kind of sensor a typical 
Imperial destroyer might carry.) In that case, the pirate lurking close to 
the sun is undetectable by a non-alerted operator, or an Impossible task for
a alert operator or on turns when the sensor is scanning only the sun
arc.

However again, a sensible planetary defense net with even one deployable
sensor or SDB will put it at the ~150 diameter point between the sun and the
homeworld. That will put it at a range of about 11 from the pirate, and 
the pirate won\'t get the sun bonus under most conditions (especially if their
are two arrays), for a signal of (13.5 - 11 - 1.5 = 1), making the pirate
not that hard to detect even for a non-alert operator. Also, no merchant
in its right mind would depart on the line towards the sun because that is
indeed the obvious lurking ground for a pirate...

To really be able to hide, you have to get down to a system that can only
spend MCr 50 or so on its main warning sensor (in which case the pirate
doesn\'t need to hide near the sun) and/or systems with no sensor warning
pickets at all. Alternatively, dusty star systems make all targets harder
to see and will be favourite lurking grounds for pirates. A dusty system
with only MCr 50 worth of sensors would be ideal. A system like that will
probably only be able to afford one SDB, anyway. By this point you have a 
pirate who\'s ship is worth about ten times the total military budget of the
system, probably about a hundred times the total value of cargo leaving
the system in a week...

(A TL13 pirate could buy a
Military Ultrablack hull coating (about 99.99% black), but that costs MCr
5000 for a 400-ton ship - out of most pirates price range.)

_Rebellion Sourcebook_ was written at the same time as _Fighting Ships of the
Shattered Imperium_, which despite its other shortcomings does seem to have a
hard set of definitions:

  * Battleships are spinal-mount armed ships capable of combat in the 
    line of battle.  By extension this includes battleriders, and also
    their battletenders/battlecarriers.
  * Cruisers are all other spinal-mount armed ships.  In addition, the
    cruiser count includes fighter carriers (considered a specialized
    type of cruiser).  The pocket spinal mounts of TNE and T4 did not
    exist at this point, so cruisers range in size from light 10,000
    ton models to very large 100,000 ton rift cruisers as big as some
    battleships (if perhaps less powerful).
  * Escorts are major combatants that lack a spinal-mount.  Looking at
    their examples, this seems to cover the PF Sloan fleet escort (or
    "missile escort" in FSSI parlance), the Rapier escort destroyer, 
    and a heavy 20,000 ton fleet escort.  It excludes anything smaller
    than a Sloan (destroyers, destroyer-escorts, corvettes, couriers,
    and close escorts).

  That means outgoing will actually be safer; 1000 D is likewise an obscenely
large surface for U-boats, er, pirates, to lurk for victims - any ship they
do find may already have a sufficient vector to make matching it either unsafe
or impossible to match.

  I prefer the outer system or non-starship model for dedicated piracy.

A very good break down.  A sharp pirate could grab a single ship in these
system but he would have to be on his toes and he would have to run like the
hounds of hell were on his heals.  He\'d better have good intel on the target
or he might get a load of tracter parts.  A distant jump in and a coast near
the trade lanes at arrond the time the target is due to arrive would be the
a good plan.  An attrition attact verses the sensor ship or some sabotage or
bribes could open a hole in the sensor net that would give the pirate more
time to ge his booty.  A combines attrition attack against the small craft
and smash and grab would be a real coup.  The DDs and DEs you don\'t want to
mess with unless you have a spinal mount!

I proposed something like this.  If the jump drives are not all that
accurate with arrival location then it makes sence to jump to a more distant
location to allow for that slop to not put you somewhere you do not want to be.

I\'d make jump accuracy related to the ships maintainence level, age,
quallity of charts, and computer power and inversely related to distance
jumped.  It make sence to make a ships jumping 4 have more inaccuracy than a
jump 1.  The jump 4 ship has more gravity wells to have to figure into their
flight path.

say closest distance = (((JnxJn)/comp number) x 100dias. x chart constant x
years sence maintainence+1 squared)

so a j4 merchant with a little maintiance due and a comp 4 and basic charts
would be... (((4X4)/4) x 100 x 4 x (1+1) squared)= 1600dias.

a j1 with good charts and maintaince and comp 4  (((1x1)/4 x 100 x 2 x (1)
squared = 50 dais.

Hummm....need a little work but... any one got some suggestion?  How about a
small randomizer?  How could that be added?

Similar to the computer corrected compound mirror telescopes.  Good idea.
Had not thought of that but they are still limited in resolution and
detection threshold to that of each individual sensor array.  

This is not true with phased array radio antenas.  They can directly add to
each other without a thresshold except the natural noise threshold which can
not be avoided.

This has to due with the diferences between photons and electrons.  Unless
or untill, \'light conducters\' with effecencies equal to that of copper wire
conducting electricity and capable of maintaining vissual infomation content
are invented, it is not posible to directly increase signal strength by
addative arrays for light as the signal must be converted to another medium
and in that convertion there is a fixed noise threshold set by the
converting sensor.  What you would in effect need is multiple mirrors
looking at the same immage and somehow able to combine their light images
directly onto a single sensor with out and polarization on phase distortion.
The mirrors themselves would have to be very cold for IR imaging to prevent
raising the noise threshold unnecessarily.  In theory it could be done on a
usable scale if you have a \'light conducter\' good enough.  Perhaps with huge
\'gravity lens\' to gather the light to the sensor?  I don\'t know what can be
invented to get arround the nature of photons to make this posible.  

What does current tech. use to get get arround the limits of apurture size?
I know that there are ways to create \'artilicial\' apurtures by electronicly.
combining the output of many mirrors but the detection threshold is limited
to that of the camera used.  This method is normally used to clean up an
image not to detect what can not be seen by the individual mirrors.  If
thing have gone beyond this I\'d love to know about it.

It would be easier to use stealth technique to prevent the reflection from
shining back tward the the target.  The is the way stealth work, some
absorbtion and the rest is directed and defused away from the potential
reciever.

Very true.  Remote sensors would be a major problem to a pirate.  You\'d have
to design a non radiator ship powered be batteries to fool the sensors if
they can \'see\' your heat radiator.  The best solution is a directed
(columated) radiator as discribed in the novel "Sun Diver".  The ship was
cooled by dumping it\'s heat into a laser.  That laser could then be directed
into deep space and thus undetectable disposal of the heat if this tech.
exist in the TU.  The problem with remote sensors this widely spaced is time
lag and syncronization from various locations.  Good computers would be
required.  The sensors would be very expensive due to the need for high gain
AND wide area coverage.  You are talking about a system far larger than a
ship could mount reasonablly due to surface area.  I think the cost and
maintain costs would rule this out for pourer and lower tech worlds.

That\'s true also.

Unfortunately, those nits are based on very real and unchanging physical
principles.

If you increase the density of data storage to the molecular or near
molecular level, without some form of constant error correction, errors
creep in over time beecause atoms and molecule aren\'t fixed, and move
around. Over a long time period, these errors will cause the data to
become garbled beyond recognition.

As you get smaller and smaller structures to hold this data, they become
more susceptible to these quantum effects, which are the basis of things
like atoms diffusing through a crystal. On a large scale, these changes
cancel each other out simply because a bit of information is composed of
so many atoms...properly stored, a cunieform tablet will retain its
legibility damn near forever, but it is _not_ a dense data store. A
powered down hard drive will store the equivalent of all of Babylonia\'s
tablets in a few cubic centimeters, but it will lose that data because
the bits are stored of so many fewer atoms.

Posit your \'circuits etched in crystal\' systems. Aside from the fact
that this is, essentially, _exactly_ what an IC is...crystals maintain
their structure so well for so long because they are uniform in nature.
If two atoms swap places, the structure hasn\'t changed.

Data is all about non-uniform structures; that\'s how data is encoded on
a uniform substrate, whether it\'s cuniform marks on clay tablets,
electric charges in a RAM chip, or gene sequences on a DNA strand.
Anything that alters the non uniformity destroys the data. You smash the
clay tablet, you power down the RAM chip, you chew up the DNA strand
with an enzyme.

Your crystal will depend on non-uniform structures within the crystals
to hold the data, the slow, inevitable molecular changes that occur even
in the most stable crystals over time wil slowly alter the data in a
random fashion, destroying the meaning of the data.

As things change around in a non-uniform crystal things get messed up,
whereas the same random changes within a uniform crystal do not mess
anything up, in the main.

Also, crystals, in particular, derive their stability from their rigid,
uniform structure. Altering that structure to contain data, introduces
weaknesses and stresses in the crystal that actually hastens their
deterioration.

Of course...all you have to do is wave Clarkes Third Law over anything,
and it works...look at Ancient Artifacts. They\'re _all_ Clarke wands. So
if you want your 50kyr storage facility in a tiny crystal, just say so.

Just don\'t let the TML gearheads at it ;-)

How do you like the damage system. Does it seem logical. Also, how come som
many jackers died? Where they not wearing vacc suits?
****************
It seems to work very well,  very easy to apply damage, and the major
damage tables add exitment to the game.

we assumed vaccsuits,  the same thing hapeened to them as happened to the
pilot on one of the fighters...rolled an 8 on the major damage table. 1d
crew are hit for 5d damage each rolled 6 for the number and rolled 20+ for
damage (shortcut, applied the same damage to all of them) for simplicity we
declared them as dead. when the fighter was hit, only got a 1 on the die
tho, so the other guy flew it home.

now we need to try a big battle and see how that stresses the system.

another not...the vector based movement sounded harder than it really was,
really quite simple to perform movement.  the fighters had no trouble
matching vectors with the traders (they shouldnt given the diffences in

next time we add missiles to the combat.

And this system can scan the entire 100 diameter sphere at that level of

The other problem is light and IR glare.  The sun would wash out nearly
anything that did not have a mirror surface and if you pointed a sensor that
could detect that pirate at 100 dias in the dark of space the sun would fry
it with the ammount of power it would collect.

Add radical stealth instead.  Don\'t just absorb it refect it away fron the

If one moves the outgoing surface to 1000 diameters or more life isn\'t
hopeless for pirates/raiders; the pirates can almost be guaranteed to see
the ship departing (even if it\'s not running its transponder, a fully-powered
non-masked merchant is a thousand times brighter than a lurking pirate, and
the pirate can concentrate a whole sensor array on the planet hex), and a 
6-G pirate ship will stand a good chance of making an intercept on a 1-G 
merchant over a big chunk of the departure sphere surface.

I have found it sufficient to cast a critical eye at the assumptions
designed to prove the piracy can\'t exist (being able to identify
before hand which ships are pirate, being able to track them
after they leave the system, etc.).

Considering 1000d from a G2 star is about 4.5 AU, you\'ll also have about two
weeks to make your intercept ;).  If the jump limit is more than about 200d we
find that the jump shadow for the star overwhelms the planetary limit unless
you\'re well outside of the life zone.

 So when I say that IMO the rules don\'t allow pirates and you say that if you
 change the rules they do, we basically agree?
   >>

Yes...or, alternatively, if you keep setting conditions or rules which make
piracy impossible, piracy will then be impossible.  <G>

I did not understand at first that you were saying canonical piracy (as
depicted in CT) was not possible...we were indeed having to different
discussions.

As the rules are now written (T4/T5/GT), piracy does appear to be dead...the
DSR is the primary culprit for this.  It might be accurate...but is it fun?
As far as I know, there was only one reference to sensors in CT:  a mil-spec
sensor could detect a vessel out to 2LS, and any sensor can track a target
once detected to 3LS.  This kind of blows the "SDB\'s will see you at once and
respond immedialtly) argument out of the water (source: The Traveller Book)
Note this does not give an ID of the contact...thats a transponder issue
(which is somewhere I\'M not willing to go <G>)  So how do those SDB\'s know you
are a pirate until you actually attack?  Most merchants will not risk getting
hurt...it\'s not thier cargo, they got insurance, etc...they would likely just
give it up.

The starship combat system as presented in CT and MT are based on a
Napoleanics-war style of combat, like the fabulous Honor Harrington novels.
With TNE and T4 (using DSR esp), it\'s now more like "Harpoon goes to space".

As for the number of ships the navy can field...nowhere have I ever seen
anyone who accounted for the Fleet Resupply units;  where are all the tankers,
ordinance resupply vessels, repair ships, hospital ships, couriers, etc. ?
These all have to come out of the TCS budgets as well as combatants. BTW,
ordinance vessels are extremely crucial to lower TL fleets:  missiles are,
IMHO, the most effective weapons in the game from a cost standpoint.  They
take no (or very little) power to use;  this is very important at lower TLs.
But they are ammo-restricted:  The Burke-class DDG is probably the finest
vessel afloat with full mags; empty, it\'s a multi-million dollar target.

Is there anyone who has any real-world knowledge of the proportion of
auxiliaries/non-combatants to combatants today?

I understand the not enough DR argument, and you\'re right. But I don\'t see
why they have to be whole modules. Looking in vehicles, you can build these
to any size - the math still works out. And there are examples of "modules"
that are not integer - Basic Bridge, Low Berths, Vehicle Bays. My
understanding is that these are not actual "tangible" modules, but useful
abstractions. Reducing a module by a given fraction should be allowed in
most cases, with an appropriate adjustment in performance. In particular,
Jump, Maneuver, Meson Screen, Spacedock, Fuel Processor, and so on. If the
rules say you can\'t do this, or if there is a compelling reason not to,
please let me know.

I\'m Spanish, so the Spanish words for these names is

- ----> Espaciopuerto...i think no Spanish would use this literal translation as it\'s too long,but rather something compound like  Puerto Espacial.

> Starport

This HAS to be tranlated as a compund name, BTW Puerto Estelar.

> Highport

This has no literal translation, but i guess it means orbital facility of the spaceport, so the translation would be Estaci+APM-n Orbital (yes, i know you may have trouble displaying the first word, as it has one of our "accents" over the o, and your navigator may not be configured to display it).

> Downport

This, again, has no obvious translation, but if you mean the surface facilities of a starport, it could be translated as Estaci+APM-n de Superficie (Surface station).

> Base

Pretty easy :  Base (but it\'s pronounced in a different way, i would tell that it sound exactly as it\'s written, but i don\'t know if that does help)

> Company

This is a hard to display word, as in Spanish is Compa+APEA7Q-a (that is, if your navigator can\'t display it, almost exactly as in English, but instead of ending with ny, it ends with our special letter +APE- (if you can\'t see it well, it\'s an "n" with a flat bar over it, a tilde i think you call it) followed by an "i" with an accent over it.

> Corporation

Also , this is very similar Corporaci+APM-n (change t with c and put an accent over the o).

>    etc?

It is abbreviated the same in Spanish, etc. but if you want to write it complete it should put etc+AOk-tera, tha is, add "etera" to etc and accent the first e  :)

Asamblea.

I know but even that large a web would have holes and limitations.  You plug
the holes as you can afford to.  100 passive satalites with simple lissening
systems for jump signatures would be more practical that a system that could
resolve a ships sized object at 100 dias.  You triagular on the entry point
and send a SDB to check out any strange arrivals.  The SDB has the good sensors.

    'body' => 'I\'m working on a cost/profit profile for a pirate cruise in the CT
pre-5th Frontier War Spinward Marches sector, with possible
operations just across any of the borders. I\'m looking to home
port the example vessel at the Alexin belt (2405 Pax Rulin/Trojan
Reach) for purposes of annual maintenance - it has a class B
starport, law level zero and no Impie bases in-system. There is
a navy base one parsec away, but considering the starport there
(class E), you\'re not supposed to be able to support one - this
"Naval Base" is probably no more than a fueling stop.

I\'m assuming that the pirate will be transferring cargos to smugglers,
and will need drop points for the goods - hollowed out asteroids,
unexamined areas of poorly-settled worlds, etc, even places to
lie doggo while field repairs are completed.

Note that there is no way a pirate can operate if, IYTU, the Imperium
can detect, stop and search every small starship that refuels in every
system in the Imperium. There must be poorly patrolled (low pop, 
unimportant) worlds available for a pirate ship to move through, or
you will have no pirates. I realize this creates a security problem for
the Imperium regarding enemy spy ships - but consider that a spy
ship would have to be small and furtive, and that anything it finds
out will take months or more to get to anyone\'s ears. I\'m not sure
how secret the location of the 83rd CruRon six months ago needs
to be.

Of course, the pirate will generally avoid the high-pop worlds rich enough
to fill space with patrol craft. 

Here are some ideas I have for the ideal system to build
a corsair\'s forward base in:

Starport no higher than class C, and the lower the better.
No Imperial interdiction squadron
No Imperial bases
Low population
Low tech
Gas giants and/or planetoid belts present
In a cluster of worlds within jump-1 of each other

The pirate I\'m working out the numbers for will find some systems
like this and establish caches for loot. Smugglers in cahoots with
the pirates will have some way of knowing there is loot to be had
(a code left somehow along a trade route) and will supplement their
income with the stolen cargo during their otherwise normal (that is,
shady) course of business. A cargo of sufficient value per ton
(say computers, gemstones or radioactives) might be retained on
board the Corsair for sale at the end of cruise back at the pirate
haven.

Crew will probably take salaries as most historical pirates did - shares
of booty. Captain gets 5 shares, Chief officers get two or three,
everyone else gets one, there may be a bonus share or two voted
on by the crew for good gunnery or boarding actions. Expenses of
running the ship are taken out of booty, remainder is split by shares.
I\'ll have to dig up that old "Ship\'s Articles" flyer I have lying around,
it\'s a copy of a contract used on a pirate vessel - included things like
offenses, an agreement not to split the swag \'till the cruise was done,
cash payouts for maimings, that kind of thing. Should be good for
ideas.

Now I\'ll just have to find a bunch of stuffed parrots to stitch to the
shoulders of their vac suits...<g>

How would replacing the chart constant with the navigator\'s skill level?
Most stars won\'t change their stellar class within the lifetime of the
average PC (or stellar empire). Besides, the sensors on any mid-hi tech
ship are good enough to figure out the stellar class of most stars within
6 parsecs (aren\'t they?). Also, keep in mind that regardless how good the
jump conditions are, a ship propagates out of J-space at the 100d limit.

 So when I say that IMO the rules don\'t allow pirates and you say that if you
 change the rules they do, we basically agree?

There was resupply...just very limited, and dependant on having something to

This is not necessarily true...I doubt if very many individuals, when
designing thier vessels, take into account manning for 3 watches (I know I
usually don\'t), and there is always casualty replacements (frozen watch
usually). GT addresses this a little bit, I believe.

Unfortunately, those nits are based on very real and unchanging physical
principles.

*Only if we continue with the same set of physical laws.  Traveller is
science fiction, and as such will move outside the bounds of the laws as we
know them.  If I really thought a computer in the year 53** would be the
same as one today, or that space travel would be limited to the physical
laws as we now know them, I\'d quit now while I\'m ahead.

If you increase the density of data storage to the molecular or near
molecular level, without some form of constant error correction, errors
creep in over time beecause atoms and molecule aren\'t fixed, and move
around. Over a long time period, these errors will cause the data to
become garbled beyond recognition.

*line up a group of molecules, and then lock them in place.  I think they
can do that even now.

As you get smaller and smaller structures to hold this data, they become
more susceptible to these quantum effects, which are the basis of things
like atoms diffusing through a crystal. On a large scale, these changes
cancel each other out simply because a bit of information is composed of
so many atoms...properly stored, a cunieform tablet will retain its
legibility damn near forever, but it is _not_ a dense data store. A
powered down hard drive will store the equivalent of all of Babylonia\'s
tablets in a few cubic centimeters, but it will lose that data because
the bits are stored of so many fewer atoms.

Posit your \'circuits etched in crystal\' systems. Aside from the fact
that this is, essentially, _exactly_ what an IC is...crystals maintain
their structure so well for so long because they are uniform in nature.
If two atoms swap places, the structure hasn\'t changed.

Data is all about non-uniform structures; that\'s how data is encoded on
a uniform substrate, whether it\'s cuniform marks on clay tablets,
electric charges in a RAM chip, or gene sequences on a DNA strand.
Anything that alters the non uniformity destroys the data. You smash the
clay tablet, you power down the RAM chip, you chew up the DNA strand
with an enzyme.

Your crystal will depend on non-uniform structures within the crystals
to hold the data, the slow, inevitable molecular changes that occur even
in the most stable crystals over time wil slowly alter the data in a
random fashion, destroying the meaning of the data.

As things change around in a non-uniform crystal things get messed up,
whereas the same random changes within a uniform crystal do not mess
anything up, in the main.

Also, crystals, in particular, derive their stability from their rigid,
uniform structure. Altering that structure to contain data, introduces
weaknesses and stresses in the crystal that actually hastens their
deterioration.

Of course...all you have to do is wave Clarkes Third Law over anything,
and it works...look at Ancient Artifacts. They\'re _all_ Clarke wands. So
if you want your 50kyr storage facility in a tiny crystal, just say so.

Just don\'t let the TML gearheads at it ;-)

*My point was that we can not determine what kinds of storage may or may
not be possible 3000 years into the future.  If you told someone in 1920
that they would one day drive around in their ford with a phone, a liar
would have been the best of the names he/she called you.  Gearhead away,
but remember you can not always apply the laws of physics used today,
because in the future they may have been proved wrong.

I\'m the RPG coordinator for MonCon \'99, which will be held on March
19-21st at the Tinton Falls Hilton in Tinton Falls NJ. In that capacity,
I\'m looking for GMs (and players, too) for Traveller events at the
convention. As one of the oldest and most highly respected RPGs, it has
surprised me that none of the local conventions in my area (that I have
attended, mind you) have had any Traveller games (of any flavor). My
goal is to change that. If you\'re in the NJ/NY/PA/MD area, and think
you\'d be interested in running such an event, please contact me
- -OFF-LIST- and I\'ll give you more specifics.

Thanx for your time...

Ummm, all of them. We are friends with the Yanks, but they have this funny
thing about actually getting paid for stuff that is bought off them.

The tension between training, maintainence and buying new equipment is very
real for all militaries ... Australia is trying to figure out how it can
afford 3 AWACs type aircraft, and still keep the rest of the stuff.

Surplus wages and surplus profit are easily high enough in Australia to
support 2% expenditure on the military.

Not for the same level of functionality ... a Traveller Escort is about
1000 dtons. A modern real-world frigate is a lot bigger, and has a much
larger crew.

>Hardly.  Show me in cannon where a world of 20million has a fleet with

One of the problems with this whole debate is that there are very few canon
examples of what actual government budgets exist in the Traveller universe,
and what it\'s spent on. My case is I can confidently assert a planet
*could* spend a small fraction of GPP on a fleet quite big enough to
intimidate the heck out of any reasonable pirate, and give most Navy
commerce raiders second thoughts as well.

Oh, and by \'obsolete colonial cruiser\' I mean something TL11, maybe 12,
pulling three gees when new and about 2500 tons. And it was probably forty
years old when they got it. The equivalent ships in the Australian fleet
are the gun-armed DEs ... we are too cheap and/or stupid to figure out how
to strap a couple of Penguin boxes onto them.

>NOT 20 MILLION only the producer in that 20 million.  Producers are those
>that generate wealth.

You can raise taxes in a lot of ways (including on fixed wealth ie land).
Most Traveller rules on the subject crunch annual per capita income at
between five and twenty thousand credits per person per year. I really dont
think that 1% of GDP is going to put your economy into trouble ... modern
democratic states have quite happily spent 7% of GDP on defense in
peacetime, and not got into too much trouble. Though if you spend over 10%
on defense for more than 5 years you\'re asking for it, IMO.

>They jump in early and lay in wait.

For how long ? And what if their approach vector is wrong, because the
target ship jumped in late and had to adopt a different course ? If the
approach vector is wrong, you need to fire up the power plant to produce
the power to run the maneuver drive.

I completely agree with you.

Cargos worth KC100 a dton will be routine, and cargoes valued at a
megacredit per dton will be not unknown. For *really* high value cargos, go
for starship sensors ... they cost megacredits per cubic meter ... call it
MCr 10 per dton including packing. At these values, the opportunity cost on
holding the cargo gets to be as signifigant as the cost of shipping.

The problem is that whilst the cargo is worth MCr 10, the ship to carry it
in is going to (in all probability) be worth MCr 20, and a ship that can
reliably capture a MCr 20 ship is going to cost MCr 100.

So our pirate needs 10 good hauls (or one great haul) to pay for their
ship, before combat damage, crew salaries, bribes and profit are
considered. If our pirate has backers, they will be expecting a pretty
healthy rate of return on investment.

A second problem for our hypothetical pirate is what happens if he did take
a couple of lumps coming in ... the captain dinna wanna give ooop wi\'aat a
scrap (or hoped to cripple the pirate with a couple of lucky shots, and
then claim the pirate ship in lieu of his annual bonus in accordance with
clause 5 (b) (iiii) of his contract). Our pirate is in baaaaad trouble if
the ship cant jump out, and one assumes that starport officials will
routinely collect \'after action reports\' from any ship limping into port
with combat damage. Avoiding this will be possible, but expensive and risky.

A third problem is high value cargos will go in high jump ships. Lets take
a Recollet. Jump-3, pulls 2 gees, couple of laser turrets, nuke damper,
couple of sandcasters. Not really combat capable, except against a hopped
up type S scout or similar. Now, we\'ve got a highly valuable cargo we need
to protect. Our best protection IMO is to write off 55 dton of cargo space,
and install enough collapsible tankage to do an emergency jump-1. Now,
given that we\'ve got power plant to do a jump-3, we\'ll be able to pull it
off unless severely combat damaged. The plan is to do a running jump to
avoid combat, either to another system or to the other side of this one
(preferably near somewhere we can refuel).

It\'s an expensive strategy (writing off about a quarter of our cargo
space), but it will keep us out of trouble nine times out of ten. Which
could be a damn fine idea if we are hauling something valuable enough to
make us all rich *if* we can get it to Mora.

Yep. And what I\'m trying to figure out is the return on investment in the
piracy business ... and compare it to something else, like going to another
state with your stolen ship, and hiring yourself out as a Naval Auxilary.

Australia\'s ASW helos go on the destroyers and frigates. I cant remember if
the Fremantle class patrol boats are still in service.

Customs cutters are completely unarmed. Our frigates and destroyers often
pull SAR and fishing patrol duty.

From memory, Fiji has a couple of unarmed patrol boats. And a rugby team.
Me, I\'d be more scared of the rugby team (infantry on the other hand ...
there is this story about the Fijians on a UN patrol in Lebannon who
carried maps of the South Pacific to show the locals where they came from).
Oh, btw, the recent Australia-Western Samoa match was a cracker ...
Australia tried to run up the score from five yards out in the last 30
seconds. Not only did the guy not score, he isnt doing much for the next
four to eight weeks either ...

Oh, if you want to pull paperwork piracy, Sing-pure is the place to do it.
As long as they have a veneer of legality, and their people arent getting
burned, they dont give a damn.

Oh, I have this great article on the Tasmanian Navy. We had one, at one
point ... a single Torpedo Boat, with four Whitehead torpedos. They
actually launched one in the Derwent, just before the Navy was signed over
with Federation in 1901.

Well, something needs to be done, because it just dont work with what we
know about the way technology and society works in Traveller.

OK, I\'m talking about the TU here, so I\'m using Traveller sensors
(specifically TNE\'s), but from what I understand these rules understate the
range of passive sensors massively. Anyway a size A planet runs to a little
less than 18,000 km which gives 100 dia as 1,800,000 km. This gives 60
hexes at 30,000 km each. This gives a surface area of about 45,000 hexes. 

A range 16 active EMS has a long range of 64 hexes which is more than 100
diameters, so the sensor array can be in orbit around the mainworld (though
obviously you\'d need at least two to avoid the planet blocking the sensors
field of view). If the operator has an asset of 8-9 they\'ll have a
detection chance of 20% per half-hour turn on a target of 100-999 tons
which has EMM, which gives a 93% chance of being detected within 6 hours
(it\'s almost certain that they\'ll have at least this, an asset of 10+ is
more likely and gives a detection chance of at least 25% per turn and a 97%
chance in 6 hours).

A range 8 passive EMS has the same chance on a ship running \'cold\' at 8
hexes or an accelerating ship at 32 hexes. IMO while it\'s nice to be able
to pick up a ship that\'s loitering before it starts accelerating it\'s not
really necessary for reasons I\'ll go into later (besides that\'s what our
nice big active EMS is for). This gives us a sensor area (cutting through
the sphere) of 200 and 3200 hexes, respectively. If the patrolling vessels
look for accelerating vessels we only need 14 to cover the 100 dia limit,
otherwise we\'ll need 225. That\'s ignoring the fact that, IMO, with 14+
patrol vessels (remember I\'m using TNE, and thus HEPlaR. I don\'t know if
this applies with thrusters, but I think so) the would-be pirate is very
likely to have his high signature exhaust pointed towards one of them.

Now about why I think you only need to look for accelerating vessels. To be
an effective pirate you need to capture vessels and/or their cargo, and to
do this you need to match velocities with a victim, or shoot it up to the
point that it can\'t maneuver so that you can board it later. In the second
case the victim cries for help and you\'ll never get to board tham, as
they\'ll be towed into port, so it has to be the former. So all the
authorities need to look for is ships that are on an intercept course with
another ship. Accelerating outside sensor range of the patrols won\'t work,
because by the time you get to intercept the victim will be so close to the
port you\'ll never get thenm disabled and the cargo into your ship before
the patrols arrive. Therefore you\'ll have to accelerate from fairly close by.

Alright assuming that you actually get to board the victim without anyone
else knowing until the victim squealed for help when you shot their drives
out (well nigh impossible). The patrol vessels in orbit (we\'ll ignore the
perimeter one\'s because I can\'t be bothered working out their average
distance) will be within 20 hexes (a reasonable weapon range) in 2.5 hours
(5 turns) at 4 G\'s, and from that time on need never be outside 20 hexes.
If they want to match velocities and location (so that they can shoot you
without risk to the target) with you it\'ll take them about 4 hours. Either
way the only way out of this one is to take some hostages onto your ship
and run like hell for the 100 dia limit or make a dangerous jump. You\'d
better hope the locals care about your hostages.

He doesn\'t just have to beat the SDB to the prize. He has to get to the
prize (which will be running like hell as soon as either you tell her to
behave or they sense you), board her (possibly after disabling her),
transfer the cargo (or fuel and prize crew the other way), and get the hell
out, all before the SDB gets into gunnery range. Also bear in mind that
even if you do sort your intercept vector out beyond the 100 dia limit the
target will be much closer to home by the time you get there, and you\'ll
still have to deaccelerate when you are close to the prize. Note that the
SDB doesn\'t need to deaccelerate nearly as much because he can afford to
overshoot.

It\'s not strictly true that you can\'t increase signal to noise by simple
addition of images from seperate telescopes. For example, if I have 16
1-m telescopes and each takes a digitized picture of the same piece of the 
sky, and I add the 16 images together in software, since each has independent
noise I get an image with 1/sqrt(16)=4 times less noise, or 4 times higher
signal-to-noise, the same as if I had a single 4-meter telescope. 

What you don\'t get is the same resolution as a 4-meter or larger telescope,
of course, since you\'re adding the images incoherently. The assumption is 
that at TL10 and above there are indeed "light conductors" and "light
amplifiers" that can maintain the phase information of the seperate arrays
(or that their are electronics fast enough to operate at the frequencies
corresponding to visible light.)

I\'m not quite sure what you mean. Current telescopes can be made with
big pieces of glass (Gemini, VLT) or segmented mirrors (Keck), usually
adding up to one big mirror. In principle (see above) you can combine the
images from several telescopes electronically (or several images from one
telescope in the same fashion.) This provides more sensitivity that you
would get from a single image. The tricky part is getting bigger resolution
than a single dish can provide; most techniques for this ("interferometers")
use mirrors to shuffle the light around coherently.

My intuition is that this would not generally work, since you can\'t
guarantee that there won\'t be a spacecraft on a line-of-sight such
that it sees the reflection of the sun off of you (in the same fashion
that bistatic radars are a problem for stealth aircraft.) Even an instant\'s
glint would show up, and diffusing it 
into a wider beam is bad since the sun is so amazingly bright...you also
have to keep the specular (diffuse) reflection below 99.99%; overall it
seems to me easier to get a black surface than to do it with mirrors. 
(A mirrored spacecraft would also run into trouble with reflected 
starlight - and with radiating heat, since mirrors are (by definition) poor
radiators.)

The laser trick turns out not to work (minor thermodynamic error by
Brin.) In general, ships will try to collimate their waste heat, but they
won\'t be perfect. Extreme IR masking assumes that 99.99% of the waste heat
goes into collimated beams, which is pretty damn good...

The remote sensors don\'t need to be that big (see my other post; a PEMS 13.5,
about 10m2 at TL12, would be quite useful) since the one that detects the
pirate will be close to it.

It scans the whole sky roughly every few hours (implicitly, sensors are 
scanning the whole sky every 10 minutes or so in a rapid scan perhaps once
an hour and using the rest of the time for a deep scan of limited pieces
of the sky.)

The pirate can\'t stay in front of the sun\'s disk for very long if it\'s
coasting (due to motion of the planet and of sensors orbiting the planet). 
(And even if it is on the disk, a seperate sun-watching telescope will see
it\'s silouhette.) Near the sun, the glare does indeed make it harder to see
(that\'s the -0.5 to signature) but not as much as one might think,
since these are space-based sensors and can be optimized for high contrast
and include coronagraphs to block out the sun. Still, the sun case isn\'t
one I\'ve carefully modelled; perhaps the bonus should be more like -1.

If the pirate uses its engines to stay close to the sun line-of-sight then it 
will be obvious to other sensor platforms in the system.

My apologies...I didn\'t *mean* to spoil everyone\'s fun. I do feel that you
can still use the DSR in a short-range-sensor universe by reducing everyone\'s
signatures by about a point; the scaling laws will still work pretty well.

Even in CT, however, there was always the problem that the 100-diameter
limit isn\'t that far away for a 6-G ship - only a couple of hours - which
didn\'t leave much time for the pirate to capture a ship and jump out.

2 LS is halfway to the 100-diameter limit...

2LS is still 33 dia for the biggest possible size A world, so you don\'t
need a whole lot of CT SDBs to get that effect.

You would need to cut the time ships are in jump, which has commo time
implications ... you take a long time to get to the mainworld, but you can
squirt off a message to a waiting ship. This will cut commo times in the
Imperium substantially, which I dont think we want.

This is one of a lot of good reasons to use batteries. Another one is it
lets you have a peak combat output in a much more cost-effective manner.

Entropy is a problem. The laser wont be 100% efficient, so running it
creates more heat.

Gosh. And there was me thinking that big guns and three gees or more of
maneuverability was a dead giveaway, and that people would be keeping
records to stop you chaninging the name of your ship, and selling the
paying passengers into slavery and their baggage and freight as if it was
your own.

Well, it isnt dead ... it\'s dead around mainworlds. As long as they stick
to chicken-stealing in the outsystem - mugging belters, selling their gear
to other belters, raiding new colonies and not disturbing anyone important,
then I think pirates can make a living.

Now, if the outsystem is dangerous, then development there is going to be
stifled (explaining why all these systems only seem to have one mainworld),
and any Free Traders venturing there are presumably going to be able to ask
hazard rates for freight.

Hmmmm.

It\'s actually worse ... modern missiles are at or over sensor range, while
with Trav rules as written, sensor range is well outside the limit that
speed of light lag imposes on combat. My analogy would be
Napoleonic-plus-radar-helos.

Well, a Far Trader makes a decent auxilary, and they cost about MCr 0.3 per
dton, as opposed to the about MCr 1 per dton a military ship costs.

Personally, I think the 10% maintainence cost we keep kicking around is 1%
salaries, 2% bureaucracy, 3% actual maintainence and 4% auxilaries and bases.

True, but we can (a) avoid breaking them without a good game reason, and
(b) consider all the implications of the laws we do break.

For example, we have calculated the maximum amount of information we can
theoretically pass through a single fibre. We are still a ways away from
reaching that limit, but it is hard-coded into information theory and
physics. To boost your system past that limit you would have to (i) add
more fibres or (ii) compress your data. 

One must be careful to distinguish between technological limits and
physical limits. To exceed a physical limit one must either change
existing laws, or extend them. For example, there is a limit to how
powerful a chemical explosive we can make, but using non-chemical
explosives we get bigger bombs. Instead of rewriting the \'laws of
chemistry\' we have added the \'laws of atomic physics\'.

Traveller already _has_ new areas where we can (essentially) write new
laws. Contragravity, jumpspace... But we must examine the implications of
the changes we make, in order to have a consistent game universe.

(I don\'t care what you do in your game universe, but I like my game
universe to be consistent and as close to known science as possible. Part
of that is the players I have, so can spot scientific goofs or
inconsistencies and milk them extremely quickly. I wish the existing
Traveller universe had had a scientific consultant, I\'ve had to rewrite
many bits of all the adventures because of inconsistencies spotted by my
players.)

Thisbe. Trin\'s Veil 2539. E4305AD-5. It has 2 planetoid belts, 2 gas
giants, pop of 5, tech 5 and government class A. It is a jump-3 from
Wurzburg, a lo-pop planet in Glisten subsector (for an alternate route
home), and has a bunch of lo-pop lo-tech worlds nearby, and *lots* of
asteroid belts in that part of the subsector. Pyramus (TV 2538, E566335-2
214) is also an option.

Dodds is the economically dominant world in that part of Trin\'s Veil, and
they are TL7.

It is also on the \'safe\' edge of the Marches ... most of the 207th Fleet is
going to be up in Lunion subsector, or closer to the Vargr and Zhodani.

If you\'ve read the Honor Harrington books (as many on the TML have) you can imagine 
this as Steadholder Harrington\'s place - her old Naval contacts ensured that the large 
naval presence continued and the Steading has developed into mostly administrative 
running of franchises (possibly including the shipyard).  Only direct employees of the 
Steadholder are conted in the population, but not transient naval personnel (there are 
1000\'s at any one time) nor the franchise holders working the ice mining circuit, 
entertainment palaces and various other lucrative businesses that paid for the right.

If we believe Pocket Empires, there is no way 900 people could "afford" a class A 
starport.

Alternative idea: much higher POP before the Fourth Frontier war, when the world was 
attacked.  Due to Steadholder Harrington\'s foresight in providing the high tech 
equivalent of fallout shelters, hers was the only steading to survive ... the 
shipyards suffered only supperficial damage, and they were vital to the on-going war 
effort.  Over the decades since then, the POP have been leaving when they could and 
the place is dying.  The vast shipyards lie quiet and the once-impressive starport is 
now a cruel reminder of a glorious past.  If it were not for the current tensions, 
there would be no navy base and the world would continue to die.  The current 
Steadholder is trying to revitalise the world, but 900 people can only do so much.  
With service commitments to the naval base, the pop is not self-sustaining ... 
perhaps an immigration drive is in order?

I\'ve always like psionics, my players don\'t seem to impliment them much,

Aliens don\'t have to be non-human... Give them thier own kingdoms, let them
rule with thier own values. At the risk of quoting something somebody said
on this list (sorry but I don\'t remember your name) give them thier own
customs and values, like the Aztecs. They had a game where if you won then
you got the privalige of being sacraficed to the gods, you were to be with
the god for all eternity. Kind of a high praise kind of thing. You don\'t
have to go that far but let cultures develop something unique to them. If
the rainy seaon comes on the full moon due to funny orbits and that then the
moon can become a god. Work out something about the world and then develop
an idea behind it, works for me :)

Sounds easy but kind of hard to stop. Look at customs here on earth, they

and look effective. When you can hide the specs to any kind of item you wish
to mention on a microdot no bigger than a pinhead the only limitation
becomes the availability opf the materials, and then there is the black
market.

MT, the main concerns were space and weight, with power being (generally)
just below that. MT costs per unit effect were generally comparable with
HG. MT starship combat WAS HG, with merely a different way to get there,
and enough data to use the strikeresque vehicle combat system.

Sensors in MT are relatively cheap; due to a different jump-fuel
calculation than all other editions (5 times J-drive volume), jump fuel ran
10-35% of hull, rather than 10-60 (J1 to J6 figures shown). Jump and
Maneuver percentages were the same.

Comparing priates in MT allows much more viability (with the sensor rule
extensions in WBH), detection is fairly easy at ranges out to about 100Mm
(100kkm), and goes down radically from there, assuming no stealth. Small
(400t) pirates can have a good chance of evading detection, can carry
enough cargo and weapons to be a threat, and dedicated "Long-Legs" can be
built as EF\'s (Escort, Fast) 2j6 performance takes 77% of hull volume (7%
for J6, and 2x 35% for 2 j6 fuel) , can operate on 12 pc per 3 weeks, and
requires small staterooms, few weapons, and no cargo, and one week
layovers. Adding 1G adds 3%. Crew-stations are based upon required control
points. (yes, I\'m getting to the point) In one game, some legitimate
"starmercs" built some 2j4 EF\'s on 400 Td Needle AF hulls (match the patrol
cutter). They replaced the barbettes with cargo space, went to bunks rather
than SR\'s, and a good sensor suite,and 6G. They were able to outrun or
outgun almosty everything, and could jump in, wait, and still jump out.

In MT, due to the much lower jump fuel requirements, pirates can jump in
and still be able to jump out even with relatively high jump numbers. If
they can capture a ship on an in-system route (there would be in-system
trade and travel, and while some would use jump, most wouldn\'t), the parts
value and potential cargos can be sold elsewhere. Add a stop by a GG for
frontier refuel, and they can be anywhere within 8 Pc in two weeks.

MT made pirates viable by rules mechanics, then created a background where
they could and would flourish. I felt that this is important to understand
when MT sources come up.

In that case, make lists of names for people, places, and things between
game sessions, when you have plenty of time to think, and have it
ready-to-hand when you run your game.  During the session, just use the
next (or most appropriate-sounding) name on the list, jot down the
association, and cross it out.  (Don\'t let the players _see_ you using
the list, though!  ;-)

Book 2, page 33.  It also states that "ships in orbit around a world and

If you use the LBB encounter table, we _are_ talking about Class A and B
(and, to a lesser extent, C) starports.  [From Book 2, page 36] On a 2d
roll of 12, you encounter a pirate.  DMs are as follows:  Class A port,
+6; Class B port, +4; Class C port, +2; Class D port, +1; Class E port,
- -2; Class X port, -4.  In other words, you have a 13.9% chance of
encountering a pirate at a Class A [roll 8 exactly; 5/36 chance] or
Class B [roll 6 exactly; 5/36 chance] starport, an 8.3% chance [roll 10
exactly; 3/36 chance] at a Class C starport, a 5.6% chance [roll 11
exactly; 2/36 chance] at a Class D starport, and no chance at all at a
Class E or Class X starport.  Pretty ugly for the well-developed worlds,
eh?  Especially when you consider that you have a 41.7% chance [8+ on
2d] of the pirate being a Type C cruiser!

Actually, it should be quite common for an atmosphere to have an endemic
taint. The kind of taint will depend on the atmospheric  composition, which
will depend heavily on the worlds\'s size, density, and water content. Give
me a week or two and I\'ll generate some rules for atmospheric composition
and taint, based on my Planetology 101 posts and material in World Tamer\'s
Handbook.

That\'s my take too.  As for who should play him...young *any* aged
Roddy McDowall would be good.  So would whoever the actor was that
played Caligula in "I Cladius"...he\'s *somebody*, but I can\'t
remember who.  Of course, Mike Meyers would fit the part.  Or Jon
Lovits, yeah Jon Lovits would be perfect...chubby, funny, but

	*Jumper* cables? A friend I work with recently had the pleasure of
no car, as her (electrical engineer) husband installed a new battery
with the cables swapped, noticed the sparking/smoke from under the
hood when he started it, and put the cables the right way. Didn\'t
mention it to her until they were driving somewhere and the ABS light
would go out ... "Oh, maybe that explains the sparks under the hood."

Yes. _Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium_ (FSSI) has several,
including the 10,000 ton ED-15 Escort Destroyer and the 20,000 ton EF-15
Escort Fleet.

FSSI implies this too, showing two different flavors of BatRons -- "Typical"
and a "Battle Rider"

It says in the _Rebellion Sourcebook_ (RS) explicitly:

"Squadrons consist of two or more ships of the same type and class, plus any
supporting ships which can provide support, escort, or reinforcement.
Supporting ships are usually not involved in the tactical operations of the
squadron and are often ignored when figuring ship totals.

"Large squadrons will have many auxiliary ships; depending on strategic and
tactical needs, they may be refueling ships, troop shuttles, fleet couriers
and courier tenders, command ships, intelligence processing ships,
transports, or repair stations." (RS, pg. 28)

In the FSSI, the Imperial Squadron Organization diagrams seem to indicate
that auxiliaries are considered part of the squadrons. For example, the
"typical" BatRon contains 4 battleships, 1 tanker, 2 transports, 3 scouts,
and 2 auxiliaries (although I am unsure whether the symbols are supposed to
represent individual ships or "elements" of two or more ships).


>However, FS states that CruRons are generally of 4 to 8 ships and the
examples
>in it implies that 8 ship BatRons are the norm. (Also, I seem to remember

>references).



In FSSI, there is a TankRon, which consists of a cruiser, 4 scouts, 2
transports, 2 auxiliaries, and 4 escorts (or an equal ratio of "elements").


>Possibly the 2-squadron fleets and 25-ship squadrons are rare and almost

A typical squadron looks to be about 12 ships, with TankRons and CruRons
(Carrier) having 17 ships (actually, 10 of the "ships" in a Carrier CruRon
are fighter wings).



[snip]


The biggest problem I am having with this assessment is the sentence "Each
sector of the Imperium *theoretically* [emphasis mine] has a group of fleets
numbering about 1,000 ships."

I find it very vague; what the heck does "theoretically" mean in this
context? If it means "If we divided the number of ships we have by the
number of sectors we have a presence in," then that\'s even *more* than the
20,000 ships Hans has posited (the Imperium has a presence in 27 Sectors
according to the MT _Imperial Encyclopedia_). Of course, I know Hans likes
to be conservative with his numbers, so ... :-)

  Presumably solid state (and for AG low running temperature) gear is
_much_ more reliable than current turbines - which would themselves
be much more reliable if built with higher TL materials and designs
but well below bleeding edge performance levels; this pronounced
trade-off of performance for cost and maintenance has a lot of uses
as outlined by Mr. Whitchurch.

  Book 4 states that pretty explicitly; grav tanks fade into gunships
somewhere above 14 Dt, and gunboats take over the nomenclature at 200+.

  If crew levels under Books 2 and 5 need to be tripled then this is the

  Presumably the crew levels represent a single full shift (and some extra

  It appears to be less about numbers of targets than the size of the
danger zones - 100 planetary diameters isn\'t large enough to stretch
the patrollers past the breaking point in most cases; the outer system
elicits a sharp <twang>, OTOH...

  I\'ve been wondering about this, and I\'m currently assuming that the
main role of intelligence ships will be to conduct cruises, collecting
data intended to check the accuracy of or supplement other strategic
estimates. This assumes small, quiet intel ships, but the alternative
of purpose built intruders poking about until forced to jump back to
a sanitized refuelling site is pretty limited without some very weird
logistics arrangements.

Actually, budget figures aren\'t exactly necessary when answering this
question. It says in the _Rebellion Sourcebook_ that "Each sector of the
Imperium theoretically has a group of fleets numbering about 1000 ships.
This number includes combat vessels ... [but] does not include auxiliaries,
support ships, and scouts." (RS, pg. 27)

Now not getting too much into what "theoretically" means (I think it means
that 1000 = total number IN combat vessels/number of Imperial sectors), you
have a stated figure of about 1,000 combat vessels per sector (regular and
reserve IN, including Colonial fleets) *in addition to* an undetermined
number of system squadrons (SDBs) that are owned by individual worlds.

The number of auxiliaries/non-combatants is irrelevant to the question of
how many combatant ships are available, since we already knoe many combat
ships are available (about 1,000/sector, not counting SDBs).

Sounds like a great writer\'s resource! I\'ve only just recently started
collecting language dictionaries, exactly for this purpose. One slightly
odd book I\'ve found is _The Concise Dictionary of Twenty-Six Languages in
Simultaneous Translations_, compiled by Peter M. Bergman. It provides
translations for only 1000 words, but in 26 languages.

I\'m also collecting lexicons off the Web. Lots of dictionaries out there.
Unfortunately they tend not to include really useful terms such as
"starport" (gosh, why not?), hence my request for translations here.

It can\'t exist anywhere. Laser light is *low* (almost *zero*) entropy.
Heat is very high entropy. Thus you *cannot* convert heat to laser
light without creating far more heat than you send away. The trick in
Sundiver isn\'t allowed by the laws of thermodynamics.

In fact, you have the problem that your *effective* radiator area is
equal to the area of the cone of radiation at the closest point to the
ship. So the narower the emission cone, the smaller the area, and thgus
the higher the radiator temp. 

Thus there are some rather tight limits on how stealthy you can get.

Huh? A ship using limited area radiators for stealth will be a
*spotlight* in the IR in the cone it *does* radiate into. That\'s
because when you limit the radiating area by (say) 50%, the
*temperature* goes up a lot faster. And thus, so does the IR
"brightness" of the ship in those directions.

Only problem is that both of those are firmly based on stuff done
*before* Roswell. Fiber optics is just taking the old idea of "light
pipes" farther. And transistors were discovered *before* Roswell.

The fact is, if an advanced spacraft *did* fall into our hands, we
*couldn\'t* figure out anything that was more than *one* TL in advance
of what we had at the time. 

If you don\'t think so, just consider the effect of dropping
spaceraft/aircraft built with current technology back into the 50s.
They wouldn\'t be able to figure it out!

John W Campbell did a couple of editorials on the topic, both involving
dropping a mid 60s recon drone back into the mid 30s. 

Poul Anderson did an article in the mid 50s going over the problems
we\'d have getting alien technology to work even *with* their help. To
start with, the stuff won\'t be calibrated in volts, watts, meters, etc.

Remember that these physical principles are theories that we assume are

Newspapers in major cities sometimes run full-page public announcements
that are lists of names, for things like evidence not claimed after the
case is closed or small refund checks due to people with no forwarding
address. I snag these, then mix up first and last names, crossing them off
as I use them.  Works for Solomani, which is what I have in my campaign.

There is also a role-playing aid, "The Everyone Everywhere List", from

Far more important for my money is that in MegaTraveller, the things that
made piracy impossible - a strong fleet, a stable Imperium and a
functioning bureaucracy - no longer existed.

The bigger problem I see for merchants in the Shattered Imperium isnt so
much the pirates as the risk of getting signed up as part of a fleet at
meson gun point.

On the flip side, you could stop making bank payments with pretty close to
impunity, if you were outside a Safe.

This might be true, but I want to cast a careful eye over canon, so GMs can
make an informed decision on the bits that dont make sense, or we can tweak
the rules so that they can allow the canonical background.

I used to use phone books for NPC\'s names.  A couple baby name books help, 
too.  For place names, it gets a bit trickier; if you use simular place names 
on two close by planets, it takes a bit of the \'alien\' feel from them.  For 
instance, I named the shallow ocean east of Ambercrombie, Grendal (the main 
city there) the Steelsheen, since its blue would be greyed a bit when seen 
from orbit.  I won\'t use \'Steesheen Ocean\' any time soon, but I *might* use it 
on some place a few parsecs away, prolly as \'Steelsheen Bay\'.

FWIW, my players (both groups of them) are wandering around on Steelsheen 
Ocean on Grendal at the moment, one group as survivers of a low orbital crash, 
the other as the search & rescue team sent out to find them.  Prob is, most of 
them read the TML.  *(

Here\'s my take on it.  Space is *BIG*.  So *BIG* that pirates *can* work if 
they work at it.  IMTU, piracy is *difficult*, but both possible and 
profitable.  So difficult, that except in cases of state-sponsored piracy 
(\'privateers\' or \'commerce raiders\'), that \'true\' pirates are somewhat rare.  
MTU is Reavers\' Deep, circa 1125, after the active phase of the Rebellion, in 
the Black War phase.  Since most of the Deep is non-Imperial, it\'s been spared 
most of the major fleet actions.

Keep in mind that referees are allowed to *ignore* portions of canon when 
putting their games together.  I, for one, ignored the Solomani raids of 1123 
against the Carrillian Assembly (a large polity in Reavers\' Deep) because it 
didn\'t fit my \'take\' on the history of the area.

This would put the timing just about right; I\'d assume the signals were picked up a few years earlier by scout ships operating rimward of Dingir.  IIRC, the radio station KDKA started broadcasting at Pittsburg in 1923.  Its signals would hit Dingir in 1950 thereabouts...

Hmmm.. I\'ve always prefered to portray him as a completely sane, rational
man.  Quite charming, actually.  Sparkling personality.  Then you do
something.  He thinks you\'re out to get him.  Your family turns up dead,
your fortune is confiscated, and you spend a few very unpleasent days being
tortured for information on the "plot" before being killed.

If Lucan had been an outright madman, no-one in the Moot would have ever

Varian\'s death.

While working on my campaign, I needed to get some Sword Worlder terms.
Since the SW language is described as being derived from Icelandic, I
contacted Iceland\'s trade rep in the US.  I think it was the weirdest phone
call he had ever had, but he was pleased at the thought of his decendents
controlling an interstellar empire ("ve are Wikings, ya know..").  I also
bought an Icelandic-English dictionary.  Makes for great campaign flavor.

OK. So perhaps only 20,000+ T escorts are included in the 1000 ship figure.

One problem I have with that is that a Battle Rider Squadron is really the
equivalent of a CruRon, not a BatRon (The 154th has only ONE battleship-sized
ship (the carrier) but 7 cruiser-sized riders).

So my hypothetical average squadron fits well with the info in FSSI?

If the sentence had said "on the average" rather than "theoretically", then
I would have gone for 27,000 ships. I chose to interpret it as "any sector
with 16 average subsectors will have around 1000 ships). Since a lot of
sectors don\'t have 16 full Imperial subsectors, you get less than a thousand
ships for sectors like Spinward Marches, Deneb, Trojan Reach, Reft, Corridor,
etc.

It\'s far from irrelevant if you are discussing the odds a pirate is up
against, since most naval auxiliaries would be perfectly able to make
life miserable for a pirate. (Unless someone does manage to save up for
that 30,000 T surplus cruiser he\'d always wanted).

  It can simplify things a lot (like having to work out relative

  Keep in mind that some of those qualifiers are going to well and truly

I can see psi cops...

for a 4I centered on Terra, that would be a given.  However, I doubt if they\'d 
get to Regency space by then, what with having to absorb everything in their 
way first.  The absorbtion would take time and effort as well as manpower.

The 4I would probably fight a major war against the K\'kree to secure its 
borders and make sure there was nobody invading them in the pursuit of truth, 
justice, and the militant vegetarian way of life.  What they\'d do with the 
Hivers is up for grabs; would they trust the Hivers enough to buy tech from 
them, or would they shoot them on sight?

Given the 4I\'s roots in the Solomani Party, would they stoop to using the 
Aslans for mercenaries?  And what do they do with the Vargr?  Paper-train them?

This would be a given, under the stated conditions.  Although, with distance, 
this firm grip *will* get looser.

Considering their position relative to the 4I, they\'d be out of the way, 
behind the Regency, which, due to its distance, would probably still be in 
business.

> 7)  The 4I uses high tech, TL 17, but tries to limit subject worlds to

I can see the 4I keeping tech down to about TL11 for civilians and outlawing higher tech in non-military hands.  This would include starships as well as weapons & computers.  But if the 4I is against high automation, then TL17 becomes difficult at best.  And would they recover enough in the 850 years since the Virus to achieve TL17?  Assuming their archives survived to allow them relatively quick rebuilding to TL12 or TL14, there\'s still the needed scientific advancements to get to TL16 & beyond.  My take, given that most surviving planets would devolve to TL6 or less, is that 850 years is *WAY* too short to get to TL17, especially given that high automation is probably outlawed, and that the necessary expertise is restricted due to the TL cap on member worlds.  I could see the 4I as having TL14 under these conditions; after all, they\'re just reinventing what they\'ve lost over the years.  TL15 is feasible too, even when you discount the infusion of Hiver technology.  The main !
!
!
point is, unless they import tech from the Hivers, they\'d be hurting for tech.

The secondary point would be, just *how* hard would they enforce the tech limits in the newly conquered provinces, considering that the further you get from the capital, the harder it is to keep track of what your people are up to.  Not easy, even with psi cops.  \'Who shall guard the guardians?\' is just as relavant in the 63rd Century as it was in the 1st Century.

And what of the Regency?  You *know* they\'d go up against the 4I the instant they run into them.  And after 850 years with a TL15 start, they\'d prolly be at least TL18 *or better*.  And keep in mind that eventually the Regency would expand through Corridor into the old 3I space due to population problems.

The main question in my mind would be, would the 4I start in Regency space, or ignite in the Solomani Rim?  My money would be on the Regency.

I\'m using the Traveller sensor rules. If you think I\'m misinterpreting them,
then show me where I\'m going wrong. If you think they are unrealistic, then
get Marc Miller to change them. But until then, accept them as basic truths.
Otherwise we are discussing two different things, never a very productive
thing to do.

No I mean 1% and 2.5% of the budget. The total amount of money available each

It\'s a simplification to allow _TCS_ and _Striker_ players to ignore more
detailed logistics problems. That\'s propably why the figure is so high.
Propably a peacetime navy costs a lot less to maintain, but most TCS and
Striker scenarios involve belligerents, so this is ignored.

>I\'m sorry I was not more explicit. 100 dias. is the Minimum limit.  What is

Practically none according to the rules. Check the description of a typical
jump in _Imperial Encyclopedia_ if you have that. If a ship "aims" for a
spot inside a jump limit it is simply precipitated out at the limit with no
ill effects.

They don\'t, but even if they did, it would also increase the odds that they
would appear somewhere far from where the pirate was lurking. The odds the
pirate is trying to beat is the chance that he can chase down, disable, and
match vectors with the victim, transfer the cargo, and jump out before an
SDB can get within shooting range.
 
>As for the pirate, he can hide nearly anywhere as lomg as he can beat the
>SDB to the prize.

And match vectors with it. Don\'t forget that. If the victim arrives at 200
diameters (which it dosen\'t) and he is lurking at the 200 diameter limit,
then the odds are very great that he is lurking at a different spot on the
200 diameter limit. If he is lurking at the 100 diameter limit (which he
can\'t under the present sensor rules) then he will be intercepting at 3G
outward and the victim is going inward at 1G. Once he passes close enough to
the victim to disable it, they will pass each other and he will have to
decellerate and chase the victim dowm. Meanwhile a patrol ship is bulleting
out from the mainworld at 3G too.

>The 1 AU statement was that he could enter the system behind and object
>like a moon and coast in quitely on Delta V.

How long will the approach take him? Every minute he spends catching one
victim costs money.

>To find him running silent you have to search everywhere he could be. His
>course could pass close to known arrival points

Known arrival points are either a random spot at the 100 diameter limit or
a specific spot on the 100 diameter limit. In the first case his chance of
lurking close to the arrival spot is low and in the secod case it would be
ordinary prudence for a system patrol to be stationed at the spot.

>and he could grab a target of opportunity.

Again, you\'re not doing the math. What are the odds of getting an opportunity
in the first place?

Non-existent slop factor.

That\'s also the problem as I see it. Except that we have quite a lot of

Quite true. But what\'s the use of creating that crack by violating other
parts of the canon?

If pirates was so common as the encounter tables suggested, then they would
cost the _private_ sector enough money that it would be worth their while to
fund their own patrol ships (which, incidentally, they do, canonically).

Necessitates changing another part of canon, making that part very much less
plausible.

But the rax base can easily support that much and much, much more.

Works for me (I\'m the proponent of the "interdimensional heat sink in space"

know more physics than I do, ane they are the ones who wrote the sensor
rules.

Changes the canon far more thoroughly than you appear to realize. It\'s not
just that the jump rules has to be changed, it\'s also that it takes ships
longer to make a jump. Which means the number of annual jumps goes down.
Which means the economic background changes, making starship travel much
more expensive.

Won\'t work. A system patrol can control a volume of space sufficient to

I tried that for a long time. Now I just ignore the discrepancies when I
game. That dosen\'t mean that I think they don\'t exist. But go ahead. If
you can come up with something WITHOUT CHANGING OTHER CRUCIAL PARTS OF THE
CANON_ then I for one would be overjoyed. I like pirates too.

No, Thom, I\'m using canon material to prove that the canon contains a
discrepancy. I couldn\'t do that without the canon. A discrepancy just
means that (at least one) one of the elements involved can\'t be true.
It dosen\'t prove which part. Only, I happen to believe that the part
about the Imperium using 1% of it\'s total production on its military
is highly plausible, while the notion of using a multi-million credit
tool to commit a crime is... less plausible.

This is why crazed emperors tend to keep a lot of loyal ( ie well-payed (
in whatever they like as payment )) retainers with large weapons around.

Of course.... if can pay them enough, maybe they\'ll help you... or better
yet, do it for you.

The anhydrous nitrogen oxides all tend to decompose back into
nitrogen and oxygen. I would not expect them to be sufficiently
abundant to form a great deal of nitric acid and give give *lots*
of metal ions unless some form of life that uses them to store
energy and oxygen is involved.  Although the nitrates are highly
soluble, deposits of their salts do form (e.g. saltpeter,
potassium nitrate) though they aren\'t the most common of minerals
and probably wouldn\'t be in any environment.

Under terrestrial conditions with free oxygen available, ammonia
is easily oxidized to water and nitrogen. But if no oxygen were
present in the atmosphere and ammonia were, the reaction would go
the other way, dissolving the ammonia and possibly giving
ammonium compounds; just as happens in our atmosphere with carbon
dioxide.

>BTW, ammonia water mixtures will give *really* weird weather

A little wierdness, maybe, but ammonia is unlikely to be more
than about a hundredth as abundant as water.

Sulfur is less abundant than the Big Four, I\'m less familiar with
its chemistry, and it tends to get tied up in minerals, so I gave
it less coverage. In oxygen-poor environments, life is likely to
make considerable use of sulfur chemistry; Oxygen poisons it,
though.

Jump Drive and the 100 Diameter Limit
=====================================

Here\'s a thought or two ...

1) The jump drive\'s  "100  diameter"  safe  jumping  distance  is
   supposed to be due to the gravity from large masses  affecting
   the ability of the jump drive to form a jump field  correctly.
   But gravity will vary with  planetary  density.  According  to
   "From Port to Jump-point" (JTAS 22) this number is a thumbnail
   rule anyway so what\'s the real rule?

2) In  MT  the  jump  task  is  \'Routine\'  outside  this   limit,
   \'Difficult\' between 10 and  100  diameters,  and  \'Formidable\'
   within 10 diameters.  Each of these are a gap of 4 on the dice
   roll, yet  the  effect  is  described  as  gradual  ("Starship
   Operator\'s  Manual  Vol  1")  ...  so  does  that   mean   its
   \'Difficult+2\' at 50 diameters?

I propose that the phrase "100 diameter limit" is merely  a  rule
of thumb provided by ship\'s pursers to their passengers and  that
seasoned space travellers have a more accurate value for the  MSD
(minimum safe distance) to form a jump point.

First some  boring  math  so  you  can  follow  my  reasoning  if
interested (since "G" is used in the formula below, the  unit  of
"G" is expressed in "gees" to avoid confusion)

    Using the formula

        L=64(M/G)^0.5

    and

        R=8D

    from the original LBB rule books  (where  L  is  distance  in
    mapping units, M is mass in earth masses,  G  is  gravity  in
    gees, R is world radius in mapping units, D is world UPP size
    code) you can deduce that 1 mapping unit  =  62.5  miles  (or
    approx 100 km as stated in the original book).  So to express
    the formula for L in miles ...

        L(in miles)=4000(M/G)^0.5

    or put another way

        G=M/(L/4000)^2

    Not wanting to be too terra-centric lets pick  Vland  as  our
    reference example.  (As an aside the specified mass for Vland
    given in "Aliens Vol 1: Vilani & Vargr" is incorrect -  given
    a diameter of 14,850 km and a density of 1.02 the mass should
    be 1.5661792.)

    So G at 100 diameters is 2.94185e-5 gees.  Remember from your
    high school physics that 1 gee is 9.80665 m/s/s and  you  get
    G=2.88497e-4 m/s/s.

    Now because the the chance of a world being exact  like  that
    is small lets  use  some  pseudo-science  to  pull  a  little
    slight-of-hand.  The  universally  constant  speed  of  light
    c=2.99792458e8 m/s and so G/c is  9.62322e-13  ...  thats  so
    close to 1e-12 that maybe it should be!  Now say  that  space
    stress is measured in units of S or in this case pS (p=\'pico\'
    =1e-12) where 1pS=3.05703e-5 gees.

    So the 1pS  (\'one pico ess\')  limit  is  the  so-called  "100
    diameter\' limit for  Vland.  Recalculating  back  gives  98.1
    diameters.

So what was the point of all that  (apart  from  wearing  out  my
calculator)?  Calculate the 1pS boundary for Terra  and  you  get
91.3 diameters ... not 100.

Definition: Minimum safe distance to initiate Jump is  any  point
            in space where the  gravitational  stress  factor  is
            less than 1pS.

Definition: 1pS is the stress on space by a  gravitational  force
            of 3.05703e-5 gees.

Okay, so now we\'ve dealt with the first point and  can  add  some
colour to individual systems.

    Note that Sol\'s MSD of 482.6 is equavalent to 4.49 AU (almost
    as far as Jupiter\'s orbit)!

Repeating this process for the "10 diameter" limit  and  we  find
its actually the 100 pS boundary.  Hey, the numbers  go  up  with
the difficulty!  A geometric progression gives a step of 3.162277
or ...

    31,623pS - 100,000pS          Formidable +2

    The MSD column assumes only one distorting object.

So if your players are running for the "100  diameter"  MSD  jump
point while being persued but for feel the need to go early, just
compare their distance with the  table  above  to  determine  the
actual risk at that point.

Another issue:  Are  Lagrange  points  (points  of  gravitational
stability) safe jump points  within  the  1pS  boundary?  No.  In
none of the published Traveller works is  there  any  mention  of
this.  The term  "stress"  is  important,  at  these  points  the
gravitational forces may be in balance but the fabric of space is
still stressed (like the rope in a tug-o-war between  two  evenly
matched teams).  Therefore, even when two or  more  gravitational
sources are balanced their effects are additive.  Compute the  pS
value  of  all  likely  objects  and  add  them  together  before
consulting the Jump Difficulty Table.

     10%     100.000
      5%     400.000

Also note that this space stress does not simply end at 1pS,  but
continues out indefinately getting smaller  and  smaller.  It  is
theoretically possible to be beyond MSD for all objects yet their
combined gravitational pulls to still exert more than 1pS!

    Extended Range Stress Table

        MSD   Stress Factor
       ----
       200%       0.250
       190%       0.277
       180%       0.309
       170%       0.346
       160%       0.391
       150%       0.444
       140%       0.510
       130%       0.592
       120%       0.694
       110%       0.826

For example, at 140% MSD the stress factor  is  0.510.  So  if  a
starship were at 140% MSD for one planet and 140% MSD for another
planet, the total stress factor would be 1.100.  This  makes  the
jump task \'Routine+1\'.

One final issue: When player characters are  feeling  particulaly
suicidal/desperate/destructive they sometimes wonder  what  would
happen if they tried to jump while still landed in the  starport.
On  a  1  gee  planet  the  stress  factor  at  ground  level  is
32,711.463pS which makes such a task \'Formidable+2\'.

... Now you know!

My point was that these 1000 ships had to be paid for out of the TCS

Well, a Far Trader makes a decent auxilary, and they cost about MCr 0.3 per

Well, that is based on a host of assumptions about what it takes
to do piracy, how you operate, who you prey on, how ships are
tracked and how easy it is to change identites.  This is a
whole series of threads (and here I was being so good about

I like the ideas... I\'ll probably still allow my players to do the psycho
mad attempts to jump at Lagrange points (stolen from /The Reality

misjumps but will be a way to run within the gravity well of the larger

I think the economic arguments that are being made are against "career"
piracy in the stable 3rd Imperium settingof Classic and GURPS Traveller, as
portrayed in previous publications (at least, that is what I am arguing
against).

There are several examples in the various incarnations of the Traveller
rules that seem to indicate that piracy is viable as a long-term career. A
couple that spring to mind:

* A player could choose a Pirate career in character generation.
* There is a purpose-built ship (the Corsair) that is good for little but
piracy.
* Pirates seem to be somewhat common in random encounters. Indeed, even
xboats and tugs(!) can be involved in piracy, according to MT\'s _Imperial
Encyclopedia_ (pg. 91).

Note that even if you steal a ship and do no maintenance at all, you still
have life support, fuel cost, and battle damage repairs to consider. Why not
just hijack the ship and sell it for millions and millions, rather than risk
it by becoming a pirate?

Okay, greed comes to mind, and that is a pretty good reason. But the
economic argument against piracy is only one element of the whole
"anti-piracy" side of the discussion. There is also the "lots of military
resources to deter piracy" argument, the "you can\'t hide in space at 100
diameters" argument, the "which merchant do you choose to attack" argument,
and the "where do you sell all of this stuff and get your repairs done"
argument as well. When combined, it looks pretty bleak in the stable 3I for
pirates.

This is why (as a sadistic referee) I liked the Rebellion, and Hard Times,
but find the CT and GT settings to be less exciting. Pirates are easier to
justify when the Imperial Navy is trashed all to pieces.

Mmm. I see what you mean. The battle riders in FSSI are all 30,000 tons,
compared to 100,000 tons each for the armored, heavy, strike, and imperial
cruisers. The riders tend to have slightly better armor and big guns (and a
slightly better defensive DM), but the cruisers have scads of missile
batteries and smaller weapons.

Furthermore, the BT-15 tender holds six battle riders, although the squadron
organization diagram for a rider BatRon only shows one tender and four
riders (thus, I am still uncertain if these symbols are supposed to be
individual ships or \'elements\' of two or more ships).

Sounds good to me. Either way, it\'s a whole hell of a lot of ships. :-)

I interpereted auxiliaries to be non-combat ships, as described on pg. 28 of
the _Rebellion Sourcebook_, but on thinking about it you are probably right.
Even fleet tankers tend to pack a lot of firepower (with some notable
exceptions). I have a hard time seeing a tanker go after a pirate, though.

Anyway, what I was trying to say was that while we can use TCS budget
figures to show that the fleet can be huge, it isn\'t necessary, because we
are told right out that the fleet is huge. Obviously the auxiliaries have to
be paid out of the budget -- so that means that the budget must be that much
bigger, in order to support *all* the ships of the fleet. As is stands, it
appears that the TCS figures will support the whole fleet anyway, so the
numbers don\'t have to be adjusted.

This is *not* saying that looking at the TCS figures is useless. Quite the
contrary, IMO.

Of course, I run games in the Rebellion and Hard Times eras, so I don\'t have
a problem with justifying pirates. :-)

Still, I have found the points brought up during the various piracy threads
_on both sides_ very useful to me in envisioning the structure of space
travel in the Imperium. It would be so kewl to come up with some figures for
the volume of traffic in known space. Do you think if we banged out some
figures and got them printed at a vanity press, they would become canon?
(just kidding).

I think much of it involves merchants engaging in a range of illegal to
legal activities.  (From piracy, to smuggling, to descreet shipping
of legal cargoes, to normal activity).  They aren\'t that heavily
armed but tend to pick on unarmed ships.  But their probably isn\'t
just one type of pirate...

Once upon a time, you weren\'t a child at age twelve. A population that
needs the women completely as breeders will start them as soon as
they hit menarch. A population that needs soldiers will start them as
soon as they can lift a weapon (especially once technology makes
fully-mature strength less than necessary).

Star Trek episode - the ones who mature about a year a century until
they hit puberty, when they\'d age quickly and the  local plague would kill 
them (a result of a botched longevity experiment).

While I am certain you will never encounter a full-time pirate captain who 
is worrying about a bank payment, the idea of "paying for" the ship
may be important. 

If piracy with a certain ship pays less than what one would get for
selling the ship, why not just sell it? The corsair cruise needs to pay
some amount of credits more profit than selling the ship would, therefore
the value of the ship is important.

If, IYTU, selling a stolen ship is very difficult, then the value may not
matter. The mutineers may have a nice new _Lurushaar Kilaalum_ class
patrol cruiser on their hands, but can\'t sell it without getting caught - 
turning corsair might be their only option.

Piracy can work in the Traveller Universe if you think about it this way,
pirates are already breaking one law, right?  So you who have said that if
a pirate has 100 MCr then he is a rich man, right?  Wrong, all he has to do
is get a bank to loan him the money to buy his ship & then skip out on the
payments...  In other words, if a pirate can scrap together say 10-20 MCr,
then he could get a ship & start out being a pirate...

Peter this was an interesting article that I will spend more time
thinking tomorrow, but before I go to bed...

Assuming your numbers are correct, it looks like you are either
going to ignore the Stellar MSD or require ships to run out all the
way out to 4.49 AU.  Personally, I\'m very much against ignoring the
Star\'s "jump point" in these discussions, because it makes more
sense to me to jump from a system\'s star to another system\'s star,
than from a system\'s planet to another system\'s planet.

Yes, they are good rules, but I\'ve complained about the ranges
before, for gaming reasons, too.

Frankly, I\'d like the detection ranges of ships to be about twice
the distance at which you can get a lock for beam weapons, a few
hundred thousand km at most.  That gives ships some maneuvering
room, a reason to deploy forward screens of boats or escorts and a
reason to use missiles.  But it also allows ships to lurk near
planets and jump areas to catch the unwary.  I *know* this isn\'t
realistic, but it\'s the gaming effect I\'d like to see.  

The question, of course, is how *can* detection ranges this short be
explained, and dusty systems won\'t do for a general explanation.<g>
Any ideas?

Hold on a sec.  I\'ve barely been paying attention.

Eris, are you saying that in in YTU, the jump limit is 100
diameters of a system\'s star?

If so, I think I like that very much.

You would ignore planetary jump-limits (i.e., 100d) that were
completely within the stellar jump limit,  but would use them for
planetary jump limits outside the stellar jump limit?

I think I like that too.


Here\'s a little text picture.  Its the ?? area I\'m curious
how you deal with, assuming I\'ve you did mean stellar diamters.

IMHO this sounds really really bad in Spanish.

In fact, it\'s the "o" the letter with an accent

Again ,"o" is the letter with accent.

Same again, "o" has the accent.

I don\'t want to start a flamewar on spelling, as all of you have been very very

The moot never got the chance to support him or reject him: He declared an
instant state of emergency, and barred the moot from meeting for a year. By
then, at least on Capitol Core, he was de facto emperor, even if he was not
de jure emperor. And was able to silence any opposition stupid enough to
show up at the moot.

Hans, (under HG) I would disagree with this. The riders should be heavily
armoured and carry top end meson/PA weapons. This should make the squadron
pretty effective against and equivalent BatRon or CruRon in straight
combat. Of course, on an individual basis the BRs are weaker than a full
Battleship.

was out of print I wanted a space minatures wargame. Then, along came
Warhammer 40k. Which was fun, and lead to some silliness amongst my RPG
group when we wanted to avoid some serious gaming (RQ, CoC, Traveller,
Stormbringer, C2020, 2300 and AD&D back then).

Then Games Workshop decided to drop mainstream gaming and move in the more
niche minatures wargame side of things, charging upwards of 40 GBP for a
game, and letting everything else hang. White Dwarf became a catalogue for
GW and I lost interest, vowing never to enter a Games Workshop again. Over
the years, I focused down on two or three systems (Traveller, C2020 and RQ
back then) and forgot about GW, aside from the odd exclaimation when I saw
kids of 10 or 12 with 50 GBP games stacked  up.

Hitting the fast forward button, sometime earlier this year I got back into
minatures based games when I bought Full Thrust.

And now one of my friends told me that WH40k has just been re-released, but
as well as the boxed set (RRP around 50 GBP) there is a rulesbook sold
separately, like the original. And it was meant to be quite good.

So I took the plunge (disguising myself) and went into the GW in Liverpool
and bought a copy. This lead to an interesting conversation with the
manager about why I didn\'t come in more often.

Anyway, I got the book home and can report the following -

1) In classical GW style, they\'ve maximised their profits by printing it
softcover with a slip case. For a 25 GBP book that\'s a bit cheaky, but not
as bad as the IG stuff - at least there\'s more than 100 pages and they\'ve
heard of typeseting and artwork, plus colour plates. I would have prefered
a hardback.

2) The rules are streamlined, and appear to favour unit level engagements,
not the old skirmish level games.

3) Characters have been reduced in strength reflecting the new focus.

Bear in mind these comments are based on the old 40k hardcover rules from
over ten years ago.

Would I recommend it? I would say yes, but guardedly, as I haven\'t finished
reading it. But it looks like a fun game, much like the original. If you
want Traveller in space, I\'d recommend Striker or possibly Laserburn in
preference. Or ACQ if you\'re at a smaller level.

Overpriced, but looks like good fun.

If we assume Terra is unusual in that it is much less dusty than \'normal\',
and that normal is a -1.5 passive and -0.5 active sensor degradation, then
pirates have a sporting chance of solving their tactical problem.

This means that with a minimal level of stealth and aggressive baffling
against a planet with a Sens 14 PEMS, a pirate has a better than sporting
chance at being able to lurk at or about 750 000 km.

Merchant ships basically have to go active, and a cheap AEMS will detect
the pirate at about 160 000km, assuming a marginally competant operator.

Detecting merchant ships running AEMS is a trivially easy task for pirates,
incidentally - the AEMS and lack of stealth, aggressive baffling etc puts
easy detection range at or about 1.6 million km, even with the dusty
conditions.

Now, 160 kkm is entirely too close make intial detection on a pirate,
especially given that weapons ranges should not be affected by dust (you
might think about a -1 dm to damage per 100 000 km of dust or something for
lasers and PAWs).

This might be short enough to message \'Stand and Deliver\', intimidate the
merchant into cutting their fire-control AEMS and standing by for boarding.
The next problem is matching velocities and boarding while the system
defenses close in.

The problem is then how do you get enough fuel onto the merchant to allow
it to jump to your haven in the outsystem (dont even think about finding
secret pirate bases in the outsystem of a dusty system) or another nearby
system, or unload enough of the cargo to be worth robbing.

Now, if cargo values are higher, merchants may be carrying large amounts of
cash on board, which could make three-men-in-a-speedboat type piracy viable
(combustion lasers can pack a large one-shot punch into a small volume).

The conflicting thesis is that evil drives out good. That the "good people
were killed quickly enough to forestall any such pre-emptive action." BTW,
there were instances in Imperial history (one gave rise to the right of
assassination) in which the good did stand up and knock off the evil emperor.
I wonder why no one did that with Lucan?

So what is Lucan doing is the Gurps alternate timeline?

using ALL the canon material it just doesn\'t seem likely that "pirates"
would be a good career choice.  In my line of work when you have conflicting
"reference material" you go back to the basics and start from there.  So
that is what follows, "The Basics":

When the LBB\'s were printed we were in the 1097-1110 time frame.  A good bit
of the material came from the Spinward Marches, which seemed to be in a
constant state of war with the Zho\'s.  There I believe canon pirates would
have PROBABLY worked and possibly had been working for a number of years.
Stability in the Imperium would have dealt a major blow to piracy as
described in the LBB\'s.  Again I think that we both agree on this point.

To go back and change that era is unrealistic and it seems to have trailed
somewhat into MT time lines so we need to play it as referee\'s as we see it.
I have in fact changed my writing\'s to reflect this more stable environment.
Now we are at the Rebellion time line in MT.  With a major force directed at
instability, Piracy has a chance to rear it\'s ugly head back up.  I still
agree that it wouldn\'t be at the levels of CT but it certainly would become
a factor.

Coming to TNE with it\'s myriad of scenario\'s, I can\'t get a real good handle
on what\'s the best course of action here.  Too many options with too little
data to really come to a conclusion.  Obviously if there were pirates, they
would pick on unarmed merchants.   If damaged (either ship) in combat it
would be too get replacement parts.

T4 allows for so many time frames that you could make a case for pirates in
any number of era\'s and have good justification.

GURPS I\'m still working on but basically I believe that it falls into the MT
(read stable Empire) so more than likely the pirate career would be a NO GO.

T5 only Marc can speak for.

My conclusion is that for most of the time line of the 3rd Imperium piracy
WAS there.  There are certainly time frames where it would be pretty stupid
to be a pirate!!  There are also a number of time frames when it could be a
very lucrative profession.  I say let the Game Master decide the fate of his
game and the stability of the Empire and we try really hard to help him/her
with that decision.  I think we should work just as hard in supporting as we
are in tearing down opinions.  Canon is canon is canon.  That doesn\'t make
it sacred, because in the greater scheme of things it\'s just REFERENCE
material for a game master to run his/her game with.  You can argue
individual points to death, it isn\'t going to solve anything.  If you feel
that you need to tear apart my basic assumptions then knock yourself out,
you missed the point of my post and I won\'t reply.

  The mutineer scenario will likely only supply a fairly low number of
ships per time period; further, a lot of effort has gone into the thesis
that pirates either evolve from merchants or generate spontaneously as
businesses with effectively purely economic motives. Thus the necessity
of economic modelling.

Communications speed isn\'t much of a limitation in the Star Wars world
from what I\'ve seen of the rulebooks.  Real time communication systems
exist that can transmit from one side of the galaxy to the other, and
besides
it only takes a week or two to travel across the entire galaxy as well.  It
doesn\'t
take years to travel 1000 parsecs, only a day or two.

My take on it is, \'Get out of the Palace and see the Imperium before I have you shot on general principles."

If it is a privateer or built by subscription or funded by a big criminal
pirate ring, then they do have to "pay" for it. Even if it was stolen, the
pirate activity has to pay more than using it for legitimate business.

Yes it is, but then you have to ask how often ships suitable for piracy
suffers mutinies and why the mutineers don\'t just fly to the unaligned
Vargr world and sell the ship in the first place?

And the Traveller canon have several organized pirate gangs complete with
secret bases and logistical support.

Which is why I have tried to make an estimate of the auxiliaries in an
average fleet. If you think more is needed, I don\'t mind. There\'s about
66% left to play with as it is.

However, there is another possibility. The 10% of original cost pa. figure is
specifically said to include logistics. So the auxiliaries could concievably
be paid out of that figure and not separately. I\'m not saying it is so. But
it might be.

BTW. I just skipped over several of David\'s posts without responding to
them, and I tell you, I\'m feeeling mighty proud of myself, mighty proud
indeed. ;-)

  To coast in at any speed requires a vector significant enough to interfere
substantially with later maneuvering; a slow approach runs into the "time is
money/lost opportunity" issue. Running a game of Mayday/Triplanetary/B:2 
should illustrate this amply.

  Planning for a specific intercept of course requires that the pirate not
be subject to any negative impacts from new navigation/maintenance rules.

  You appear to have first edition; second edition CT Book 2 (p.35):
"The suffix P on any ship type can be construed as a pirate; such a ship
will probably attack, or at least try to achieve a position where it can
make th eattempt". These xP encounters occur only at C through X starport

  In any case the results of these tables need to be considered as game

True enough, but look at what the much less corrosive carbonate ion
did! Even *weak* nitric or nitrous acid is stronger than carbonic acid.
Yet we have a *lot* of metal carbonates formed that *aren\'t* biological
in origin. 

What I expect happens is nitrate ions grab metal ions in silicate and
sulfate/sulfide rocks. Then once they are in solution, they\'d react
with the carbonate ions to form carbonate precipitates in the oceans. 

So I\'d expect heightened levels of nitrogen oxides to shift the balance
between silicate and carbonate minerals in the upper crust.

True, though ammonium is *so* soluble that as with nitrates it\'d take
*very* unusual circumstances to create ammonium minerals. So it\'d tend
to stay in solution until you got the oceans *saturated* (which isn\'t
easy!). This *would* tend to produce basic oceans however. Which could
have major effects on everything from geology to life.

Temperature & pressure changes will vary the *local* percentages in a
solution by *large* amounts. Check out Hal Clement\'s "Star Light" for
examples of some of the *weird* effects you can get. 

Also, you can get *sudden* drops in local atmosphericv pressure when an
air mass rich in ammonia encounters surface "water" with low ammonia
content. And the reverse will happen if a high ammonia body of liquid
hits the right temp.

Should make for interesting weather.

The fact that it *does* get tied up in minerals is significant. Like
chlorine it\'s pretty darn active (even though oxygen and fluorine are
far more active). That\'s *why* minerals wind up the way they do. 

It pays to consider the electronegativity of various elements. 

F	4.0
O	3.5
N	3.0
Cl	3.0
Br	2.8
C	2.5
S	2.5
I	2.5
Se	2.4
P	2.1
B	2.0
As	2.0
Si	1.8

Those are the non-metals (and a few semimetals) listed in order of
electronegativity. When forming compounds, the elements at the top
"have first choice". Most metals are around 1.0 to 1.8, with the noble
metals being over 2, and the highly reactive alkali metals being 1 or
less. For the metal half of a compound, the *lower* electronegativity
wins.

That\'s why *all* the fluorine found is in mineral deposits, and why
they tend to be compounds of the least electronegative metals that are
somewhat insoluble (which usually means calcium).

Out in free space, the dust that systems form from will be any possible
compound and a lot of *weird* radicals. Once they start accumulating
into larger masses, they start reacting with each other. And as the
clumps get bigger, they start to retain the heat from decaying
radio-isotopes (more common at the time of system formation). So they
warm up, and the big ones warm up farther.

Get hot enough for liquid hydrogen and you\'ll get a few polar compounds
in solution and they *may* react a little with each other. liquid
methane is better, but it\'s still a *polar* solvent, so it\'s onlt
really going to dissolve organic compounds, and not many of those. 

Once ammonia melts, you\'ve got a *polar* solvent, and inorganic
chemistry starts to really take off. When water melts things really get
moving. 

And when things get big enough that the *mineral* grains settle to the
core (concentrating the heat even more!) and the *minerals* start to
melt, *look out*!

So one of the "tricks" is to consider geochemical processes. Fluorine
though rare is so damned active it\'ll grab onto whatever it wants. Dito
for oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, etc. But that works out to be hydrogen.
And on non-gas giants, the hydrogen goes away. Nitogen gets into the
atmosphere because it\'s so *hard* to make it combine with metals. Most
of the other non-metals cheerfully glom onto metals. 

Which gets us down to why sulfur winds up in minerals rather than the
air. :-)

But a lot of other weird things happen in the deep crust and the
mantle. things that can have major effects on the atmosphere.

According to the TNS reports, he is off on a \'Grand Tour\' of the
Imperium...whether voluntarily, or otherwise has been left unsaid.

BTW, I\'ve never seen Lucan as the raving madman type, but more like a petty
tyrant, a short-sighted, self centered opportunist, elevated far above his
competence to lead the Imperium.

Presuming the whole truth is explained in the Rebellion Sourcebook, Lucan saw
in a hearbeat how to get the throne for himself, and took it. There\'s little
evidence that he ever really thought about it seriously, or that he was ever
anything but a spoiled royal playboy. He was too far down the line of
succession, in a time of peace and prosperity, for him to have ever been
considered seriously for the throne, or trained for it.

In the beginning, he wasn\'t a madman, just someone who got to play out his
fantasies of being The Boss, instituting a firm hand on the ship of state...at
that point, most people who opposed him probably figured that after a while,
when he got used to being Emperor, and the immediate crisis was over, he\'d
settle down, learn to take direction and advice from his ministers and the
Moot, and turn out to be an indistinguished little Emperor.

He always viewed the rule of the Imperium primarily as to how it affected
_him_ rather than everyone else. Under the pressure, he broke down and went
insane, but that was long after he\'d eliminated either by attrition (his best
commanders had to get out there and command) or by direct order ("Damnit,
Admiral! QUIT opposing me on this...you\'re FIRED!"), and was surrounded by
compliant yes-men.

By then of course, he was delusional, but so well entrenched it would have
taken a plot by his insiders to kill him, much as the abortive attempt to kill Hitler.

You missed the third possibility:  that  you  take  a  marginally
greater risk.  The task rating for jump  (in  my  article)  moves
from \'Routine\' to \'Routine+1\' at 56% of MSD ... just over 2.5 AU.
Commercial transports and passenger liners probably wouldn\'t take
any unnecessary risk, but private craft (like Free Traders) might
do so, especially if it can save a few credits in life support.

Exiting jump is another matter, according to cannon  any  attempt
to exit jump within MSD is shifted such that jump exit is at MSD.

Quoting from "From Port To Jump-point" (JTAS 22):

    "Many times, the unsafe jump radius is completely within that
    of a larger unsafe jump  radius.  In  the  Terra  (Sol  0207)
    system,  the  orbits  of  Mercury  and  Venus  are  contained
    completely within the 100 diameter limit of the G2 star Sol."

But it also says:

    "Every object within a 1000 diameter sphere of a  given  mass
    defines a jump mass vortex.  For objects outside that region,
    set up another vortex based upon  those  independent  masses.
    For vortices within the same parsec, jump-1 is sufficient  to
    travel between them.  A  jump-1  is  how  ships  travel  from
    Regina/Regina (Lusor) to Gagamshir/Regina (Darida), a  simple
    5000 AU hop, still taking one week."

So, accepting the JTAS article (which was a key  for  mine)  then
you are correct: "you can\'t ignore the star\'s MSD", but  you  are
also incorrect: "you _can_ jump from  planet  to  planet  (rather
than star to star)".

I still think that my "subspace heatsink" is the way to go. A method
linked to thruster technology that allows a ship to use whatever subspace
medium thrusters thrust against as a heat sink. It\'s a tad contrived, I
admit (a technological device that works for only one thing and can\'t
be used for anything else), but I think it is a reasonable handwave.
Such a heat sink would be hideously expensive, of course, which would
make warships more expensive -- something I think would be a nice bonus.

Very fine work, but put the mass of our sun into the calculation ;-) the 
jumplimits will go up. Now you must travell far more away from a star, depending 
on the stelar mass between 2 and 5 AU! I\'m using it.

	WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH TRAVELLER!!!!!


	This kind of behavior really pisses me off.  I don\'t subscribe to
this list to read political commentary of any stripe.  The TML, for all
its arguments, is one place on the planet where people _aren\'t_ talking
about Monica Lewinsky -- and I\'d like to keep it that way!  Didn\'t your
mother teach you that it\'s not nice to insult people\'s politics or
religion?  Frankly, I find the comparison of the President of the United
States to a murderous madman, even a fictitious one, to be deeply
offensive.  I have let countless similar remarks on this topic and others
go unchallenged, but I simply can\'t take it anymore. 
	I have been continously astounded by the willingness of some
people to insult the beliefs of others on this list.  The above is but the
most recent of egregious examples of this, such as the thread in which a
list member who is also a pacifist was repeatedly called a coward.  This
is utterly inexcusable.  My purpose is neither to defend nor attack any
particular view point or group.  It is to insist that the members of the
TML exercise the same civility and respect for each other in cyberspace
that we would demand of them in real space. 

	THE TML IS A PLACE FOR DISCUSSION OF A HOBBY WE ALL SHARE AND 
LOVE.  PEOPLE WHO CAN\'T OR WON\'T RESPECT THE RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND 
NATIONAL DIVERSITY OF THE TML\'S SUBSCRIBERS SHOULD SIMPLY GO ELSEWHERE.

	Sincerely,

I\'m not too thrilled with it either. What sounds better?

In the Traveller universe, we use different words for ships that
can\'t jump and those that can: spaceships and starships.
So maybe instead,
"Spaceship" = "Nave espacial"
"Starship" = "Astronave"
and 
"Spaceport" = Puerto espacial"
"Starport" = "Puerto astronaval"?

Two, pirates want their prey intact.

We get the following: Pirates _want_ to be detected as such. heave

standpoint they have an advantage, as well as maneuver, most likely.
If they can get into range before the target can jump, or help can
arrive, they win.

They way to improve things for pirates is to look for good places to
hunt--worlds that are moons of GGs will have farther 100 diamter
limits, for example (not to mention extra dust, and radiation if
Jupiter is a model). Worlds that are within the 100D limit of the
primary are another likely hunting ground ("The damn Navy has been
talking about improving our sensors and defences for over 75 years,
but we always get the short end of the stick.") 

Actually, in the last case, you\'ll always drive away from the star
to jump out, and the other way coming in----pirates can appear as
merchants coming to the world, and will onnly give themselves away
when they break.  Anyway, I think it\'s not impossible under DSR.

There\'s an implicit assumption that at TL-10 it becomes possible to
build visible-light synthetic-aperture arrays as sensors. If this
isn\'t possible, sensors will look like they do at TL-9 - seperate
trackers and scanners and a moderate cap on maximum size. Sensors
past the biggest TL-9 could be built but size would go up by x100
for each +0.5 rather than x10 (you\'re adding more telescopes, which
is less efficient than one big array.)

Also, some people (Hi anthony!) think that confusion with background
objects will begin to dominate - in which case you could just cap the
sensor sensitivity again at about 13.5 or so.

Eris\' rapidly-moving stutterwarp ships probably have signatures about -1
and sensitivies -0.5 relative to stationary ships.

Finally, for pirates - and anyone trying to hide - there is the "shadowing"
maneuver; if you can remain at a constant bearing relative to a target -
either heading towards it or away from it, which usually requires that
it isn\'t accelerating, or constant range and matching its acceleration - 
you should get about a -1 (normal success on a Difficult Pilot roll)
or -2 (outstanding success), because you\'ll look like a star.

Ian writes
>If we assume Terra is unusual in that it is much less dusty than \'normal\'
From an astronomical standpoint, this isn\'t a terrible assumption;
the amount of dust in other solar systems is unknown. We know how much
our system has, we know how much a handful of young and extra-dusty
systems (Vega, Beta Pictoris, etc.) have - thousands or millions of times
more than our system - and that\'s all; current techniques can only detect
systems about a thousand times more dusty than ours. In fact, one of the
missions for the interferometer mode of the two Keck telescopes (being
constructed by NASA) is to measure extrasolar zodiacal dust - it\'ll be
able to see systems about ten times denser than ours.

This dust won\'t be thick enough to interfere with weapons fire - the
only noticeable effect would be a bright diffuse glow in the local
ecliptic, and a very very bright glow in the IR.

Using GUPS High-tech, I found some damage figures for nuclear

there is no concussion in space, this is \'heat pulse\' damage.  Since
it affects a whole side of the ship at once, armor protects at half

TL 12 missiles are antimatter missiles and therefore are the sole
preserve of sophisticated galactic navies; you won\'t see them in the
posession of local fleets.  TL10 missiles are laser-pumped fusion
missiles, and are standard armament in smaller imperiums where TL12 is
not the rule.  TL9 missiles are miniaturised fission-fusion-fission
devices, and are usually only found on independent worlds of TL9.

There\'s a reason I chose these ranges; they correspond to -29 (2
miles) to -39 (100 miles) - meaning that as a missile approaches, the
bonus to hit it with point defense fire goes from -39 at the furthest
to -29 at the closest.  1 mile is the closest approach, because even
at a relative speed of 1 hex/turn, that last mile will be closed at 10
miles per second.

Because of the low rate of fire of lasers, point-defense gunners must
decide at what range they will engage incoming missiles (for most
missiles, it\'s 1 mile, but if the enemy is suspected of using nuclear
missiles, a longer range should be chosen.

Likewise, the nuclear missile gunner should secretly choose what range
he\'s going to set off his missiles.

The further off missiles are engaged, the better the point defense
gunner has to do on his roll.  

range (miles)	must make Point defense by
100			10
70			9
45			8
30			7
20			6
15			5
10			4
7			3
5			2
3			1
2			0

Needless to say, there\'s no dodge roll for nuclear missiles.

For those who don\'t want to do the math, here\'s the required number of
nuclear damper modules to create a defense of the appropriate size:

range (miles)	nuclear damper modules

100			256,000
70			4,000
45			128
30			16
20			4
15			2
10			1

A missile that has been set to detonate at the same range as the
target ship\'s nuclear damper limit will be safely neutralised on a
simple skill roll by the operator.

What if the missile gunner hides a small number of nuclear missiles in
a salvo of normal missiles?  There are various ways to handle this,
but I personally like the idea of numbering the salvo, having the
missile gunner secretly assign them as either nuclear or conventional,
and allowing the point-defense gunner(s) to fire at them in whatever
order he chooses.  In practice, this kind of tactic should be pretty
effective.  I should expect that Imperial capital ships (50,000 dtons
and up) would put their dampers up at 4,000 so they wouldn\'t generally
have to worry about nuclear missiles.  One could allow a sensor roll
on the radscanners, but they need to make the sensor roll by 5+ in
order to identify the missile as a nuclear missile, and with range
modifier of -39, a TL 12 command bridge sensor suite will have a -1 to
skill to identify the nuclear missiles, meaning that the sensor
operator must make his roll by 6 or more.  For TL12 basic bridges the
roll must be made by 9 or more.  A roll that succeeds, but does not
make the roll by 5+, could discern that there are nuclear missiles in
the salvo, but not which ones are which.

There are plenty of ways to add complexity to this situation.  The
first one that springs to mind is:

Allow nuclear missiles to attack salvos of missiles.  With no
defensive fire and no dodging, the only way to stop this is for the
offensive gunner to allocate conventional missiles from the salvo to
attack the incoming nuclear missile.  The missiles would have to move
at less than their full-out acceleration for this to be possible.

Because patriotic Imperials understand that the 
Imperium is something bigger, grander, than any
one single Emperor. During the Rebellion, what
forstalled action against Lucan\'s incompetences
was the fact that there was a dire emergency --
an insurrection spawned by a cold, vicious,
betraying power-grab thinly veiled with some
"democratic" rhetoric -- supposedly for the 
Imperium\'s one good.

Given Dulinor\'s action, and with him still fighting,
it\'s more than a little bit difficult to then
knock off Lucan using the same rhetorical justifications.

Ironic, isn\'t it? Dulinor is the one who legitimates Lucan.

He and Varian are taking (separate) incognito grand

Just about.

IMTU I base the distance on a constant times the ratio of the radius
of the local star (or stars) to the radius of Sol. I *probably*
should use stellar mass rather than the stellar radius, but I don\'t
(actually I know I should, but I don\'t like the ranges it gives me).
Anyway, the constant I\'m using is 250 (125 diameters).  If the
constant was 200 it would fit the 100 diameters of canon.

The reason I use the star rather than a planet has to do with
the distances and masses involved, and the requirement I have that
the Astrogator *manually* lock onto her target during the Jump Task
regardless of the quality of the jump charts or calculations.  She
can lock onto a star\'s mass at interstellar ranges (and *that\'s*
what the J number is all about IMTU), but anything smaller than a
gas giant gets washed out in the star\'s gravitational shadow.

My way of doing things is only for MTU, of course.  However, for
*any* TU, the star should be a much more "visible" target than a
planet.

I don\'t, IMTU (I don\'t allow in system jumping to anything smaller
than a gas giant..it\'s too small to lock onto), but for an orthodox
TU I would.

I\'m sorry Bloo, but I can\'t decipher your picture.  

I think you\'re asking about jumping to planets inside or outside the
stellar jump limit.  I say the ship can only jump to a point at the
star\'s jump limit, or to the jump limit around an outer system gas
giant.

This means you have to travel from the jump limit in to a planet
further in, or out to a planet further out on maneuver drive.  This
*can* take days, even weeks in some cases, and this is where my way
of doing things seems to most differ from canon.  Of course, I\'m a
heretic, so that doesn\'t bother me too much.  ;-> However...

...the time a ship stays in system between jumps has always been on
the order of 7 to 10 days.  It seems the canon way of describing
this time in system is: 

1.  The first day a ship arrives in system a few hours, at most, from
    the main world, it travels to the main world and docks/lands.

2.  The ship sits in port where it loads/unloads cargo, is serviced,
    and the crew goes adventuring and cargo hunting for the next
    week.
     
3.  After about a week the ship lifts, flies to the jump point and
    jumps for the next system.
 
My way is...

1.  The ship arrives in system anywhere from most of a day\'s travel
    to a couple of day\'s travel from the main world.

2.  The ship travels to the main world and docks/lands.

3.  The ship sits in port for 2 to 5 days loading/unloading cargo
    and being serviced while the crew goes adventuring.
    
4.  The ship lifts, spends a day or two travelling to the jump point
    and then jumps to the next system.

I\'ve never found it to be a big problem to cut the time on planet
in half.  Sure a party might still spend a week or more diddling
around a planet, but that\'s because of adventuring, not because it
takes that long to do the actual work of getting the ship ready to
fly again. 

Making ships (and slow merchants take the longest) spend up to a
couple of days flying each way from jump point to planet opens up
all kinds of interesting possibilities.  I won\'t mention "the word
that must be avoided", but it does make their existence a little
more viable.

Probably true (I could possibly find out for sure, but, if I then posted
it, I\'d have to degauss _all_ of your hard drives [as well as degaussing
your _brains_... ;-)]).

The question is, what size warheads would _fit_ on a standard-sized
missile?  (Let\'s face it, if you can\'t put it on target, a _gigaton_
nuke doesn\'t do enough to justify popping it.)

Yes, but can we put them on a 250mm shell?  That\'s only ten inches...  the
warhead of a standard missile is a 250mm HEAT explosive device.  (p. 158
and 159)

GURPS Vehicles, p110: a 1 megaton bomb can be fit into a 200mm shell at
TL9.  Since a 200mm shell is 100 KT at TL7, I felt justified in the tech
levels I used.  I used 200mm instead of 250mm because a nuclear warhead is
likelier to have more safeguards on it than a conventional warhead.  IIRC
American nuclear bombs have seven failsafes of various kinds.

If you want to, you can design larger missiles (perhaps fewer to a bay) for
larger warheads.  I did it this way so that the missiles would not be
immediately obvious what kind they were, at least from infrared or visual
sensors.

Oh, and be careful on your replies.  Did you want to send your reply to
anyone except the list?

Yep, that\'s one way to look at it.

Or you could require the ship to travel to the stellar jump limit in order to jump. Different strokes, eh? ;->

Ok, here\'s a task for our physicists.  Can you come up with a
logical sounding "subspace heatsink" that does as little violence to
physical laws as we know them?

Personally, I use slower than light stutterwarp for maneuver in my
games.  This reduces IR signature a great deal, so it\'s less
important for me, but it is for more conventional maneuver drives.

Yes, but while stutterwarp cuts the IR, a grav scanner should pick it up
rather easily.
Might even increase the detection range?

That depends on the range of the grav scanner, doesn\'t it?  Bruce\'s
DSR doesn\'t address grav scanners and I don\'t believe FFS2 does
either.  In FFS no ranges are given for densometers.  So, I guess
you can set the range for grav scanners to whatever you\'d like.
Personally, I limit the range to a few hundred kilometers for
anything remotely ship sized, long enough for planetary mapping, not
long enough for ship detection.

 <snip>

 One thing that a simple 100dia Stellar limit does is make calculations
easy, however. A table of Stellar Radii (found in Book 6:Scouts and various
Astronomy sources) gives you a number that basically IS the radius in AU
of the Jump Horizon.
 And since a great many worlds in Traveller orbit red main sequence stars,
the stellar Jump Horizon still plays a part (Habitable orbit at 0.2 AU,
Jump Horizon at anywhere from 0.2 to 0.55 AU).

Same thing happened to me.  I called Games Workshop\'s customer support (a
toll-free number the local GW store gave me) and they quizzed me on the
batch number of my copy of the game (it\'s on the back of the box) and on a
randomly selected word from within the rule book to be sure I actually
owned the thing...  They\'re sending me a replacement copy when the 2nd
print run is made (next month) and a post-paid sticker to return my
(defective) copy.  It seems much of the first batch (whatever that is) had
various problems, from flakey bindings, to having covers torn to shreds
because they were packed, along with a LOT of plastic figures, etc., into a
too-tiny box...  

I am NOT AT ALL a GW fan, but their customer support impressed me...

True, true, but I just have to say one thing...  These game designers have
most likely never served in the military & do not know current military
tech...

I can fit a 10 Mt Nuclear Device in a brief-case, I think I can fit it in a
250mm Missile tube, at our current TL...  By the time we reach for the
stars Iwould think 100 Mt could be fitted in the same space...

<sarcasm> I am on a mailing list?  I thought you were all very nice people
sending me stuff about Traveller?  I never knew I was on a list...  How
does one get on this list, I just bought some used MegaTraveller stuff the
other day, could that be the reason you nice people are emailing me?

It is true...  The Russians have had, durring the cold war that is, 10 100
Mt warheads pointed at Washington DC...

Btw, what would be the effect of MIRVs in GURPs space combat...  Would all
of the warheads hit the same target or would they seek out differant ones?

Well, the Russians thought so...  Remember in gorund combat, horses, hand
grenades, & nuclear weapons, almost does count...

Well.. I have some time at my disposal, so I could try to provide a
not-indo-european translation of these words. B-)
So here goes my 0.02FIM : These terms in Finnish:

Still we need those non-European languages...

Perhaps "avaruussatama" as well, but "thtisatama" could work as well.
In my opinion "thtisatama" is bad, but some people say that they could
use it.

These are hard. Perhaps "kiertorata-asema" and "maa-asema".

"Space station" is "avaruusasema".

I would translate "Navy" as "Laivasto" or "Avaruuslaivasto".

Somebody could add to sthis list, my governmental english vocabulary is

I can try to provide Finnish usage examples, if people want.

Ok, some more heretical ideas that apply to MTU...

No, not to empty hexes.  If you don\'t allow ships to jump to empty
hexes you can create choke points and strategic routes through
certain systems.  I think it makes for a more interesting
"geography", or would that be "astrography."  ;->

However there *are* "dark objects" in some non-stellar hexes that
have been (or can be) discovered and used.  Small brown dwarfs,
rouge gas giants and frozen cores are out there in most non-stellar
hexes.  Finding even one is a Staggering Task with an average time
frame of decades, but it can be done.

Within known space, the Imperium for example, many of the discovered
"dark objects" are charted and some even have deep-space refueling
depots established out there.  They form bridges between star mains
allowing the mass of J1 and J2 ships to move from main to
main...although with difficulty.  They also make an interesting
place to send your party, out in the middle of nowhere..in pitch
blackness one little outpost of light with a couple of dozen half
crazy hermits servicing passing ships.

The areas around these dark objects can also be very lonely spots,
especially in less travelled or frontier areas.  This is one place
where ethically challenged individuals might prey on passing fat
traders with little risk of interference from patrol ships.

Finding new "dark objects" is a full-time occupation for a branch of
the Scout Service.  For former scouts, who are adventuring, finding
a new "DOR" (Dark Object Route) can be worth a fortune.
Megacorporations and the Space Navy might want to keep the location
of DOR\'s to themselves gaining for themselves an advantage in
movement.  So might the crew of a free trader.  Of course, having a
valuable secret also makes you a target for people that want to take
it from you.

A TL10 battlesuit provides a radiation protection factor of 20 (divide
radiation by 20) so we can probably reasonably assume that a starship hull
will have a PF of 100 for civilian ships and 1000 for military, higher for
TL12.  This doesn\'t invalidate your point, but it does make the radiation
somewhat more survivable.

IMTU, & IMNSFBHO, high tech without high automation is difficult at

I can see psi cops...

Actually, the psi generally ignore most folk, realizing it to be a waste 
of time to try and watch everyone in sight.  However, if you are a 
person of some importance, you can count on being watched.

for a 4I centered on Terra, that would be a given.  However, I doubt if 
they\'d 
get to Regency space by then, what with having to absorb everything in 
their 
way first.  The absorbtion would take time and effort as well as 
manpower.
===============================

True, though I don\'t know where the Regency is exactly.  I have\'nt 
gotten any TNE stuff yet.

================================

The 4I would probably fight a major war against the K\'kree to secure its 
borders and make sure there was nobody invading them in the pursuit of 
truth, 
justice, and the militant vegetarian way of life.  What they\'d do with 
the 
Hivers is up for grabs; would they trust the Hivers enough to buy tech 
from 
them, or would they shoot them on sight?
==================================

War with the K\'kree is a guarantee.  The Hivers they just don\'t trust. 
Not enough to shoot on sight, but if they think they have an 
excuse............

==================================
Given the 4I\'s roots in the Solomani Party, would they stoop to using 
the 
Aslans for mercenaries?  And what do they do with the Vargr?  
Paper-train them?
===================================

The Houses of the 4I do use Aslan and Vargr Mercs.  The Vargr are 
considered cousins of a sort, considering their Terran roots.

This would be a given, under the stated conditions.  Although, with

this firm grip *will* get looser.

True.

Considering their position relative to the 4I, they\'d be out of the way,

in 
business.
=======================================

True again.

=======================================

I can see the 4I keeping tech down to about TL11 for civilians and 
outlawing higher tech in non-military hands.  This would include 
starships as well as weapons & computers.  But if the 4I is against high 
automation, then TL17 becomes difficult at best.  And would they recover 
enough in the 850 years since the Virus to achieve TL17?  Assuming their 
archives survived to allow them relatively quick rebuilding to TL12 or 
TL14, there\'s still the needed scientific advancements to get to TL16 & 
beyond.  My take, given that most surviving planets would devolve to TL6 
or less, is that 850 years is *WAY* too short to get to TL17, especially 
given that high automation is probably outlawed, and that the necessary 
expertise is restricted due to the TL cap on member worlds.  I could see 
the 4I as having TL14 under these conditions; after all, they\'re just 
reinventing what they\'ve lost over the years.  TL15 is feasible too, 
even when you discount the infusion of Hiver technology.  The main point 
is, unless they import tech from the Hivers, they\'d be hurting for tech.

The secondary point would be, just *how* hard would they enforce the 
tech limits in the newly conquered provinces, considering that the 
further you get from the capital, the harder it is to keep track of what 
your people are up to.  Not easy, even with psi cops.  \'Who shall guard 
the guardians?\' is just as relavant in the 63rd Century as it was in the 
1st Century.

And what of the Regency?  You *know* they\'d go up against the 4I the 
instant they run into them.  And after 850 years with a TL15 start, 
they\'d prolly be at least TL18 *or better*.  And keep in mind that 
eventually the Regency would expand through Corridor into the old 3I 
space due to population problems.

The main question in my mind would be, would the 4I start in Regency 
space, or ignite in the Solomani Rim?  My money would be on the Regency.

Now this is posible.  A 1000 ship sector Navy INCLUDING escorts is
reasonable.  What I said was 1000 capital ships alone was not reasonable.
It does not fit the numbers in the histories of the frontier and false wars.
if escort are in the same proportions as wet navy then their will be 200
capital ships and 800 escorts or 250/700 if their are a lot of cruisers.
Cruisers tend to have fewer escorts as they are normaly part of the escort
for larger ships.

I\'d say you would have to go by their \'job discription\' more than their
title.  Their are \'cruiser\' built to act as heavy escorts  and some
destroyers built for direct attack on capital ships.

Most navies have units that pull double duty.  Perhaps they would be called
escort cruisier.  A main line flat top carrier ussually has a pair of
cruisers, 4 DD or DE and maybe a few more ships in it\'s screen.

>Perhaps escorts in BatRons and CruRons are not counted while escorts organized

I think they would have to be.  More than likely the \'missing ship\' are
auxilleries and \'coast guard\' ships belonging to well to do planets.  There
would also be armed am armored cargo ships for transport of logistic in war
time and specialty troop ship than are rarely seen.  In the USA the few
remaining troop ships are not on the roles but \'seconded\' to the marines for
training.

Then the number of ships is out of line with CT history.  Look at the
production nubers for the two cruisers that have thier own books.  Those
numbers and their sevice dats does not make sence for a 1000 capital ship
navy per sector but does make sence for a 250-300 crusier heavy capitol ship
navy.

That\'s true.  I would not have a problem with that either way.  The numbers
of battle rider deployed in the CT histories are low and would not throw of
the economics either way.

Where is \'fleet\' defines as the ships of one sector?  I have not seen this.
I have seen \'sector fleet\' and \'subsector fleet\' both used.  Also I would
think there would be almost as many fleets that were not assigned to patrol
duties as there are those that are assigned or at least a stategic reserve
in core sector.

Where is squadron size defined?  I missed this too.  The fleets I have seen

I would think so and that the auxilleries out number the combat ships in
those squadrons.  That was the pattern in WW2.  This would bring thinks in
line with the 1000 combat ships including escorts sector navy.

2 battle ships and 6 escorts or 1 battle ship 2 cruisers and 5 escorts.
Sounds very reasonable.  If you mean 8 battle ships in on formation this is
not reasonable.  It would leave the formation to vunerable to fast attack ships.

A very reasonable mix.  I jump ship escorted by 7 escorts and carring 7
criuser sized attack craft.  Personally I would have removed 2 escorts and
added two jump capable cruisers with thier own fighter capacity but thats
just me.  I like a slightly high average ship mass.

This is not a good squadron to use as it is a battle rider squad.  In CT
battle ridder are uncommon compared to jump warships.  For a jump capable
group to carry equaul firepower it would raise the cost quite a bit.

Auxiliary ships gernerally equal or outnumber the combet ships at least
historicaly.  The CT battle histories I\'ve read generally delt with the
combat ellements and \'fast raids\' of cruiser spuads but simiple logistic
would require massive transport capacity to attack a planet or reload the
missle bays of a cruron of batron.

>but what about the couriers, destroyers, smaller escorts, transports and

I read in the scouts book the the scout couriers are sumsumed in times of
war into the navy.  I think that this is where they come from and the navy
just barrows what it needs.  This would explain very well why the scouts are
so willing to let people \'barrow\' their expensive ships.  The \'owners\' are
helping to maintain the \'reserves\'.

Don\'t forget the costs of bases in there.  A subsector naval base would cost
at least as much as the ships it was designed to service at one time.  If it
could handle 2 battle ships the dock would cost the same or more than two
battle ships or there abouts.  The support structures would cost as much or
more than the navy.  At least than is how is today.

Thats true but FS was CT and in CT battle riders were the exception not the
rule as far as I have seen in the order of battle listed for the false war.

I think using Striker may be a mistake.  It was writen mainly for planetary
combat.  I\'m not sure that it\'s numbers would apply to the navy.  I was
never able to get a copy of Striker of my own so my knowledge of it is
limited.  Are their buggetary numbers in it for the purpose of building and
operation a space navy?  All I ever saw was ground combat.

Does anyone know the current spending of the USA in the military compared

Where are these numbers coming from?  I have not seen them and would love to

    'body' => 'I\'m working on the numbers at home, but I thought I\'d give a little
preview of the ideas I\'m working with. To wit: what a pirate gets
for his troubles.

Let\'s assume we\'re using a 400tn _Nishemani_ class corsair, the
classic example pirate ship - probably a refitted armed merchant
or paramilitary ship. It\'s got a 110tn cargo bay that can, among
other things, hold a 100tn ship. Like a type-S Scout, or a Seeker,
or an X-Boat, or any one of those small craft that are all over an
inhabited system. It also has twenty low berths, so you have
somewhere to put the crews of those craft.

Now, I\'ve got some assumptions about piracy that I\'d like to
reiterate, just so critics know my basis and can kibbitz properly.

1. Pirates need to clear out quickly; for most targets, the patrol
will be on the way.

This limits what you can take. Small craft (the big profits). Vehicles. 
Vac suits. Supplies. Passenger valuables. Select items from the 
cargo bay. The contents of the ship\'s safe. Missiles & sand canisters
(if the target hasn\'t "given" them to you already).

What you can\'t take: Ship components. Bulky cargo items. Fuel.
Starship weapons. Valuable things, but you simply don\'t have the
time to get them.

This will not apply if you\'ve hit the target in an unpatrolled system, and
that\'s good - you may well have taken a hit or two from a target well-
equipped enough to be in an unpatrolled system alone, you\'ll need all
the booty you can get.

2. It\'s very hard to jump away a starship you take.

If the target had fuel, it would have jumped away from you. It\'s almost
trivial for the crew of the target to lock out their computers long enough
for the patrol to catch up. And if you had to put a couple laser bolts into
their Engineering Compartment to convince them to give up, they\'re
not going anywhere anyway.

There will be exceptions to this, but I feel they will be rare enough that
we can ignore them for the purposes of this study. The captain who
succeeds at taking and selling a major starship has a right to be proud
of his unusual accomplishment.

3. You can use or sell what you take.

Here are my assumptions on value for items:

- ----

Starships: 10% of value. Starships are so well documented that it is
expensive to dispose of stolen ones. They may simply be used as
auxiliaries to the "pirate fleet". Few will be taken, as per #2 above.

Small Craft: 25% of value. They are more ubiquitous, and tend not to
be kept track of in interstellar databases as much. (note: one lifeboat
taken will pay all maintenance, life support and salary costs for a
400tn corsair for about three years).

Vehicles: 25% of value, for the same reasons as small craft.

Supplies: Spare parts, tools and life support essentials can be taken.
There is a bit of a handwave here, but I assume that the pirate can use
these to defray some costs of life support and to affect the price of his
annual maintenance. Total up what the target ship spent on life support
for the current trip, and credit the pirate 25% of that towards his life
support expenses only. As for annual maintenance, reduce the cost
to the standard .1% per year - the stolen parts and tools help make
up for the bribes and extra costs, even in a law level zero port, of
getting annual maintenance done on a less than legal starship.

Vac Suits: assume one per crew member of the target, plus two
spares. Each one worth Cr10,000, pirate recoups 25% of that.

Rescue Balls: Assume one per passenger including low berths, 
Cr600 each, pirate recoups 25% of that.

Passenger valuables: Assume, as a minimum average, cash and other
easily convertable valuables on hand equal to the price paid for passage.
These valuables are recouped with no reduction (or the reduction is
included in the average). High passenger Cr10,000, Low passenger
Cr1000, Middle passenger Cr8,000.

Ship\'s Safe: Ships need to carry cash, they can\'t remain on-planet
long enough for credit to clear in a crisis - whether it\'s a fine that needs
to be paid or an opportunity speculative cargo. Figure as an estimated
average, Cr25000 per 100tns of ship. Note that my only real source
for this is the Cr100,000 the _March Harrier_ had on hand at the start
of _The Traveller Adventure_, it may be much higher. This will be in
cash, recouped at 100% of value.

Ship\'s Locker: Ignored. Assume that items go to replenish equipment
stores on the pirate, the locker is really so varied from ship to ship
that it\'s hard to come up with an average. We can safely assume that
a pirate ship will run out of storage space, rather than run out of
miscellaneous equipment.

(However, a note: in the AD&D game, the most commonly overlooked
type of treasure is household goods. Those kobolds may have only
had a handful of pennies, but that big iron cookpot is worth a gold piece
or two.)

Cargo: The pirates will have to (very) quickly evaluate the cargo, and
guess what they have time to take. A zero-G cargo handler robot or
exoskeleton would be a very good thing here. Variation is too high
to allow a very useful average value of what can be taken, as one ship
may have two tons of gemstones while another may have nothing but
grain. I decided on allowing the pirates to recoup an average value of
Cr250 per cargo ton of the target (25% of Cr1000 per ton). This allows
some losses for travel, middlemen, and the other expenses of getting
even a valuable cargo to market.

(Note: In AD&D, the second most often ignored type of treasure was
trade goods. <G>)

Passengers: I decided to leave kidnapping for ransom or slavery out of
the equations. There will be exceptions, and I even have some ideas
(for later) that the slow communications time of the Imperium may make
kidnapping for ransom far easier than it is on Earth today, if you are 
patient or ruthless enough.

- ----

With the above numbers, I\'ve hit a tentative conclusion as to what a
pirate needs to do to keep going: 

A Far or Free Trader will get him about Cr100000. A Fat Trader will get
him about MCr3 and change. Small craft are worth several MCr each.

Not counting the value of the ship, the pirate needs to spend about
MCr1 a year in maintenance, salary and expenses. 

So:

One starship taken in the course of a corsair ship\'s career will pretty
much amortize the entire value of the pirate ship for five years or
more.

Each small craft taken and popped into the cargo bay will pay
expenses for at least two years, or pay part of the value of the
pirate vessel. 15 lifeboat/launches is all it takes to completely pay
off the current value of a 400tn Corsair, pinnaces and ship\'s boats are
worth even more.

Ten Free Traders taken in a year will pay all expenses except battle
damage.

One Fat Trader taken will pay all expenses for about three years except
battle damage.

Most battle damage will probably occur in an unpatrolled system,
as the stakes are higher and the target vessel is probably better armed.
Unpatrolled systems are the only systems where a pirate will want to
fight at all - the risks are too high compared to the rewards in a system
where patrol ships are en route to the fight.
Targets taken in unpatrolled systems can almost always be considered
valuable enough to cover cost of damage - unless the damage stops
the pirate from jumping back to base.

Therefore:

Even if a pirate has to hunt for an entire year to bag one Fat Trader,
he\'s still making reasonable money. I believe this answers some 
arguments that a pirate loses too much money by lying in wait for 
targets, or by having to transit several systems to get from a base 
to a good hunting area.

Income can be far, far higher than just expenses if the pirate hits a few
good targets. This allows there to be enough income potential to make
up for the really bad luck a pirate can have - one missile hit can cost
millions, even if it doesn\'t kill you. Piracy therefore becomes high-risk,
but very profitable if the risks pan out.

There may be more efficient uses for a starship than piracy, but there are
people who cannot do legal careers for various reasons and ships they\'d
not be able to use legally. Combine the two, and you get Corsairs.
 I believe my analyses show that a pirate can make money, if the setting
IYTU allows them to survive and travel.

Please take a look at my assumptions, especially those on the value
of the booty, and comment - these assumptions are critical to the
economic viability of the pirate career.

I wasn\'t talkin ton-for-ton. Is was saying that a Battle Rider Squadron is
strictly speaking a CruRon  (a bunch of cruiser-sized vessels, albeit really
_tough_ cruiser-sized vessels). Would you care to match a squadron of BRs
anainst an equal _number_ of battleships?

Anyway, while I\'m not certain how they stack up in combat, a battle rider
squadron is certainly the equivalent of a CruRon rather than a BatRon for
purposes of refuelling. And also when it comes to the price.

Imperium is. Note that this is not the way I believe the canon says it is.
I do believe it is almost entirely compatible with canon (with possibly a
few minor exceptions). Anyway, I\'d like to hear your opinions (I\'d be
especially thrilled to hear Marc\'s opinion ;-).

- ----
In theory the structure of the Imperium is very simple: Each star system
constitutes a sovereignty governed in any way its inhabitants see fit. As
members of the Imperium these sovereignties have surrendered certain of
their rights to the Emperor; they agree to let him collect and administer
a certain percentage of their annual production, to obey a number of basic
laws (the Imperial High Laws), to let him tax certain activities, and to
leave foreign relations with non-Imperial states to him. The Emperor turns
over these rights to his vassals in return for fealthy and these vassals in
turn parcel them out to lesser vassals. Each star system thus have two
associated authorities: its own government administering system affairs and
an Imperial noble administering Imperial affairs.

That\'s the theory. Human nature (and most alien natures too) being what it
is, it is no surprise that in practice exceptions abound. Indeed, it could
be said that the exceptions are the norm.

MULTI-SYSTEM SOVEREIGNTIES: The Imperium frown on multi-system sovereignties,
but quite a number of these exist. In the early days of the Imperium many
pocket empires joined it as a unit. Whenever possible the Imperium tries to
break these up eventually, but a number still exists even today. On occasion
the Imperium has even been obliged to form some of its own to meet
exceptional political problems; the largest and most famous examples are the
Antarean and Solomani Autonomous regions. A more frequent source of multi-
system sovereignties are the planting of colonies by member systems. Imperial
policy favors the granting of full membership to colony worlds that have
grown big enough to make it on their own (which is why some colonies are
deliberately kept much smaller than optimum by their mother worlds), but if
a former colony prefers union with their mother world there is not much the
Imperium can do about it. Mega-corporations and the largest sector-wide
companies constitutes another kind of multi-system sovereignty.

IMPERIAL WORLD LEADERS: The principle of having two different kinds of
leaders, system leaders and Imperial nobles, frequently run afoul of the
pride and ambition of powerful world leaders, especially if they are
hereditary rulers. It often becomes a political necessity to appoint them
Imperial nobles. Thus the Matriarch of Mora is both the head of the Moran
government and the Duchess of Mora Subsector. The reverse can also happen.
An unscrupulous Imperial noble assigned to a young, developing world is in a
very good position to acquire title to vast tracks of land. In some cases he
can end up owning, or at least running, the whole world.

IMPERIALLY OWNED WORLDS: Over the years the Imperium have acquired outright
ownership of a lot of real estate including a number of whole worlds. When
that is the case, the noble assigned to it controls both its internal and
its Imperial affairs.
        
Imperial nobles have two different kinds of fiefs. One is a personal fief
granted to him in order to provide him with a secure income. Money
derived from personal fiefs go into the noble\'s private accounts and are
theoretically his to spend as he wants (in practice nobles with really
big personal incomes may be expected to contribute some of that wealth
for various semi-official purposes). This kind of fief is sometimes also
called an estate (An Imperial estate to distinguish it from a personal
estate which the noble own in his own right). The size and value of an
Imperial estate can vary tremendously. Not only may the Emperor give purely
symbolic estates to nobles who are rich in their own right and substantial
estates to others who are less well endowed, but a relatively poor estate
granted centuries earlier may have grown in value over the years.

	The other kind of fief is the kind described in the first paragraph
of this article, the power to collect and administer (or in the case of
lesser nobles, to collect and pass on to higher authorities) Imperial taxes.
This is also sometimes called a charge.

It is usually said that each Imperial world has a marquis associated with it.
This is true if the world is of reasonably high tech level and has a
population level of 7 or 8. The Imperial taxes from such a world comes to
something between MCr1000 and MCr100,000. Any world with taxes less than
MCr1000 will propably only rate a baron. A world with taxes higher than
MCr100,000 rates a count. Some worlds are too small to rate even a baron.
Such worlds are usually part of a neighboring fief.

Considering 1000d from a G2 star is about 4.5 AU, you\'ll also have about
two
weeks to make your intercept ;).  If the jump limit is more than about 200d
we
find that the jump shadow for the star overwhelms the planetary limit

I understand the not enough DR argument, and you\'re right. But I don\'t see
why they have to be whole modules. Looking in vehicles, you can build these
to any size - the math still works out. And there are examples of "modules"
that are not integer - Basic Bridge, Low Berths, Vehicle Bays. My
understanding is that these are not actual "tangible" modules, but useful
abstractions. Reducing a module by a given fraction should be allowed in
most cases, with an appropriate adjustment in performance. In particular,
Jump, Maneuver, Meson Screen, Spacedock, Fuel Processor, and so on. If the
rules say you can\'t do this, or if there is a compelling reason not to,
please let me know.
*****************
well the *number* of modules is integer, the concept is to use whole
numbersss of the modules to simplify the design system.  there is no real
\'problem\' with using 0.75 of a manuver module, or half a spacedock.  (I
think the jump and F.Pross are whole modules tho)  it just adds an extra
level of complexity.  It still works, in that it remains fully compatible
with vehicles.  It does however make the discription harder to read, and to
check.  also some modules need to be whole numbers for sure..like the
bridegs, sickbay, engineering, etc.

Yes, this is almost exactly the way I play it. My Nobles are also
responsible for the starport territory, the Imperial office there and also
to keep an updated copy of all local laws at the starport. The laws are
sent along with the taxes to the next higher level (subsector) so that
anybody (in theory) can study each Imperial worlds local laws before going
there.

Due to the immense temptation to do fraudelent things with the Imperial
taxes (mainly by downplaying census figures) there are at the Sector level
secret tax aauditioners that are sent to suspected worlds (an interesting
player career). This is also the reason why the Scouts update population
figures and TLs; to asses the taxbase.

All IMTU of course.

Does this mean that the gunner would get the normal +10 for point defence
and have it cancelled out by this factor? Would they use the 0-hex range
modifier of -39? This would mean that a missile coming straight at you a
mere 100 km away is no easier to hit than a fighter flying by and evading
at 5000 km...which seems wrong.

As I have said before in various KKM debates, there\'s essentially no way 
a space-combat-capable laser can miss a missile-sized target inside of a
thousand km or so (whether it\'s dodging or not...)

Something I don\'t like about G:T\'s space combat system at a general level
is that the range table (which modifies to-hit rolls) goes as the log of
range - which means it changes rapidly at very short ranges (see thewolkes
post - there\'s a big difference between 100 miles and 2 miles) and very 
slowly at long ranges. This is almost the exact opposite of what you want - 
the chance of hitting a non-evading target is linear with range and an
evading target goes as range^4 power, staying near unity for a while and
then dropping like a rock. BL did a pretty good job of modelling this
with its -1 DM/3 hexes...

A general G:T missile question: Can missiles "dodge" point defence fire? 
My instinctive answer would be no...but the rules are silent.

There are some grav scanner rules in FFS2 addenda. They\'re adjusted to
make grav sensors quite short ranged against thruster-plate powered
ships. Back-of-the-envelope I would think ranges against stutterwarp
ships could be similar - I could make a handwaving technobabble case for

This is sort of a fuzzy question. Hulls with no masking have a temperature
of 300K (room temperature). Hulls with additional IR masking have their hull
cooled down to 100-250 K - with the exact level being set to "whatever it 
takes to make the hull less bright than the spillover from the radiators"
(there\'s always some spillover, even if the radiators are pointed away.) 
My sensor model really only did the basic non-masked case; the masked 
case numbers are fairly rough - enough to show me that some masking was
possible without spending weeks trying to balance radiator heat and hull
heat. 

A complication is that hull heat comes out mostly in the mid-to-far IR while
radiator heat comes out in the near IR; they\'re detected in somewhat
different ways with different scaling factors. What I really should have done
was have seperate "passive near IR" and "passive far IR" signatures - but
life was already complicated enough with passive vis and passive IR, so I
used radiator waste heat for passive near IR and assumed that you always
refrigerate the hull enough to keep it negligible. THe rarely-used 
"minimum signature level" (based on 1 kW/m2) is supposed to represent
hull radiation as well...

A perfect set of sensor rules would have seperate radar, LIDAR, 
reflected visible, emitted visible, emitted NIR, reflected NIR, and
emitted MIR signatures (in addition to grav and neutrino) signatures, but
it would be a serious pain.

In High Guard, probably yes. A single big spinal mount hit kills anything 
(you\'re pretty much guaranteed a "fuel tanks shattered" with a J spinal
or bigger). The BR\'s are one point harder to hit than the BB\'s, so they\'ll
get spinal mount hits more often. The BB\'s have more secondary armament so
they\'ll do better at "whittling" away armament with missile hits to try and
push the BR\'s spinal below J...whether this will work or not depends on the
exact designs, but it will at least be a close fight.

If you look at the speed/range table, the -39 value is for about 5,000
miles.  The -29 value would be about 100 miles.  Yes, this is fudged some.
I admit it... if you don\'t like the fudge, engage all missiles with no
penalty.  A good section of the guessing game goes away, and nuclear
gunners will set their missiles to explode at a range appropriate to what
kind of nuclear dampers their targets are likely to be carrying.

So basically any laser-equipped ship is immune to (conventional) missile fire?

Why do you want a linear chance?  The size of the critter in your field of
view drops off sharply, as the inverse of the square of its length (which
is what they use).  Evasion is part of the dodge roll.

>A general G:T missile question: Can missiles "dodge" point defence fire?

Actually, they\'re not:

page 168, paragraph 7, last sentence: "Ramming craft cannot Dodge
point-defense fire."

They just didn\'t put it in the point-defense section, which they should
have.

Technically, Riders are trying to be cheap capital ships... The definition of
Capital ship is a big ship that can kill anything, but can only be killed by
another capital ship. Everything else better run and hide.

I just saw a piece on WWII capital ships and it said that it was several years
into WWII before it was clear that airplanes from carriers could kill a
Capital ship. Then, of course, the whole set of definitions changed, and the
old terminology became obsolete (though people still used it).

Bah...if you look at the rules for black globe generators, you discover that
they absorb all energy and suck it in to their capacitors, and don\'t emit any
heat -- with the net effect that they violate the second law of thermodynamics.
Any ship with a black globe could have virtually perfect EM cloaking by playing
games with emissions and flicker rates (and still manuever, of course).

I thought that they got rid of that problem a while back (sort of around
the time they printed Stormbringer / the first 40k etc).

My friend who recommended it just confirmed the same story to me as well.

Wow...we have briefcases which violate the laws of physics?  Ten megatons is
approximately 500 grams of energy, giving a minimum mass (for fusion) of around
100 kilograms (maybe more...don\'t know exact conversion ratio for LiD), actual
mass is going to be greater.  This is a _hard_ limit for fusion weapons, which
means the upper limit for the missile sizes in GT is about 1 MT.

Briefcase nukes are limited to about 100 kT last I knew -- not that this isn\'t
quite a lot.  IIRC current strategic missile warheads are all under a megaton.
.  Last I knew suitcase nukes were limited to about 100 kT.

I don\'t know for sure.  I have the Judge\'s Guild Ley Sector Guidebook,
but it has no details of the kind your looking for.

Milieu 0 Hardcover has Fornast 100% Contacted in 150, with 70% incorporated..

I think you might extrapolate a number from when Gush. was contacted,
since you have to go through Dag., and then add a delay since Cleon
focused on Spinward exploration.  Or use Ilelish to handwave a slower
contact rate.

At Year 0:
Dag:    40% contacted, 10% integrated
Gush:  25% contacted, 10% integrated
Ilel.  5% contacted, 0% integrated
Forn. 10% integrated, 10% integrated


At Year 100:
Dag.  100% contacted, 45% integrated
Gush.  75% contacted, 40% integrated
Ilel.   40% contacted, 20% integrated
Forn. 82% contacted, 45% integrated
(Gush,. 100% contacted in 140)

Looking at the various tables, it looks like there is always
10% contact before any integration, and then integration
is 1-5%.  I\'d handwave the rate of contact to be half
that of the Fornast, and the rate of integration 1/4th,
since its trailing and the Lesser Rift is out there.  This makes
it likely that there was 10% contact no later than year 0, giving
a 1% integration at that time.

411 systems in Ley.  1% = 4 systems.

In the Ley sector guidebook, the Imperium only holds 10
subsectors out of 16.  So maybe slow the rate of integration
even more.

Hope this helps.

Actually, it changes rapidly at intermediate ranges.  There is no major
difference between 16- to hit and 28- to hit ;).  From 50% chance to hit down
to a 2% chance is only a 10-fold increase in range, and another doubling in
range drops it to zero.

For reference to point defense fire -- if you assume that point defense fire
occurs one second before impact, then we get
Range(hexes) = velocity (hexes/turn)/1200 (seconds/turn), or about 10 miles per
hex of velocity; using standard GURPS rules we add velocity to range.  This
gives a range penalty of around 25 with a vector of 1; with typical TL 10 fire
control (Cx6 software, assume skill 14 gunner) you\'re 10- to hit.

Accurate way to do PD fire is:
PD fire bonus: +16 (effectively, 1/500 range), use the relative velocity of the
missile as the range.  RoF bonuses only apply if they are for battery bonuses.

Of course, the missile rules wildly overestimate the accuracy of a
remote-guided missile travelling at enormous velocities at a small object...

Marc, being somewhat sly and sneaky, has posed the question about what is

assumptions about the dividing line for the Alternate:

1.  Loren has said that in the GURPSverse, Strephon was away from the
Capital doing exactly what Strephon was doing in the Travellerverse;
inspecting Longbow.  There were some hints from late GDW publications and
from Dave Nilsen that Longbow had a psionic element to it.  I suspect that
Strephon was given a vision of the Travellerverse; his assassination, the
rebellion and the eventual collapse of civilization.

2.  In the GURPSverse, Strephon is working VERY feverishly to avoid the
future he was shown.  He has ordered the death of Dulinor, and I imagine he
told Lucan in very clear terms that he needed to get out and grow up, or
suffer a severe case of jacketed lead poisoning.  I suspect Varian was
ordered away as an insurance policy, just in case history cannot be
manipulated after all.  I would not be suprised to find that Varian is sent
to Margret\'s domain, either to ensure her loyalty or tom make sure she does
not try to usurp the throne in case Strephon is killed.

3.  I have a feeling that, rather than creating a magic handwave that
states the Cymbeline chips and the Virus research never existed, Strephon
will send orders to the research station ordering all Virus projects to be
terminated, the files wiped and the materials destroyed.  In face, he may
even be scared enough to have the Navy just bomb the station to ensure no
knowledge or samples survive.

4.  In TNE, Strephon saw something else at Longbow; the effects of the
Empress Wave.  Will this still be an issue in the GURPSverse?  I suspect
that it will be (though perhaps not quite as extensive as some hints have
suggested for the future of the TNE universe).  I would bet that the
Zhodani Consulate may suffer some upheaval, and maybe even a civil war.

5.  Strephon also saw how very quickly the Solomani Confederation mobilized
and seized the rimward portions of the Imperium.  This would have to worry
him, and perhaps initiate either a significant military buildup or urge him
to seek a negotiated formal peace with the Solomani.  Either would not be
popular with certain hard-core Solomani Supremicists and hard-line
Imperialists at home.


So, what do you think?  If you were Strephon in 1116, and you were given a
vision of the Imperium\'s future as seen in TNE, what would you do?  Can
this be a good thing for Strephon; being haunted by visions of a collapse
that in no small measure was due to his own mistakes and poor assumptions?
How much would he have told Varian, or even Lucan?

So, how about it Loren; am I even close?

     WHAT THE HELL DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH TRAVELLER!!!!!


     This kind of behavior really pisses me off.  I don\'t subscribe to
this list to read political commentary of any stripe.  The TML, for all
its arguments, is one place on the planet where people _aren\'t_ talking
about Monica Lewinsky -- and I\'d like to keep it that way!  Didn\'t your
mother teach you that it\'s not nice to insult people\'s politics or
religion?  Frankly, I find the comparison of the President of the United
States to a murderous madman, even a fictitious one, to be deeply
offensive.  I have let countless similar remarks on this topic and others
go unchallenged, but I simply can\'t take it anymore.
     I have been continously astounded by the willingness of some
people to insult the beliefs of others on this list.  The above is but the
most recent of egregious examples of this, such as the thread in which a
list member who is also a pacifist was repeatedly called a coward.  This
is utterly inexcusable.  My purpose is neither to defend nor attack any
particular view point or group.  It is to insist that the members of the
TML exercise the same civility and respect for each other in cyberspace
that we would demand of them in real space.

     THE TML IS A PLACE FOR DISCUSSION OF A HOBBY WE ALL SHARE AND
LOVE.  PEOPLE WHO CAN\'T OR WON\'T RESPECT THE RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, AND
NATIONAL DIVERSITY OF THE TML\'S SUBSCRIBERS SHOULD SIMPLY GO ELSEWHERE.

From: Walter Smith <SmithW@HARTWICK.EDU>
Subject: Economics of Piracy: the Booty (long, request for comments)
Let\'s assume we\'re using a 400tn _Nishemani_ class corsair, the
classic example pirate ship - probably a refitted armed merchant
or paramilitary ship. It\'s got a 110tn cargo bay that can, among
other things, hold a 100tn ship. Like a type-S Scout, or a Seeker,
or an X-Boat, or any one of those small craft that are all over an
inhabited system. It also has twenty low berths, so you have
somewhere to put the crews of those craft.
*****************8
what do you do with the crews once you capture them?


Now, I\'ve got some assumptions about piracy that I\'d like to
reiterate, just so critics know my basis and can kibbitz properly.
1. Pirates need to clear out quickly; for most targets, the patrol
will be on the way.
This limits what you can take. Small craft (the big profits).
**************
DOH <Smacks self in forehead>
I should have thought of that long before.


What you can\'t take: Ship components. Bulky cargo items. Fuel.
Starship weapons.
***********
OTOH you could take out peices of them...say 10% of the total value of the
laser, with a resale value of 10% of that.  or play it safe and hit unarmed
targets.


2. It\'s very hard to jump away a starship you take.
If the target had fuel, it would have jumped away from you. It\'s almost
trivial for the crew of the target to lock out their computers long enough
for the patrol to catch up. And if you had to put a couple laser bolts into
their Engineering Compartment to convince them to give up, they\'re
not going anywhere anyway.
*************
another thing...like those seeker in the belt, snap them up fast, and jump
out...even at 2MCr resale..not a bad price.


Starships: 10% of value. Starships are so well documented that it is
expensive to dispose of stolen ones. They may simply be used as
auxiliaries to the "pirate fleet". Few will be taken, as per #2 above.
***************
sounds about right.

Small Craft: 25% of value. They are more ubiquitous, and tend not to
be kept track of in interstellar databases as much. (note: one lifeboat
taken will pay all maintenance, life support and salary costs for a
400tn corsair for about three years).
*************
that means it streches a bit farther in GT as LS costs are lower.

Vehicles: 25% of value, for the same reasons as small craft.
**************
load of air/rafts is great!!


Supplies: Spare parts, tools and life support essentials can be taken.
There is a bit of a handwave here, but I assume that the pirate can use
these to defray some costs of life support and to affect the price of his
annual maintenance. Total up what the target ship spent on life support
for the current trip, and credit the pirate 25% of that towards his life
support expenses only. As for annual maintenance, reduce the cost
to the standard .1% per year - the stolen parts and tools help make
up for the bribes and extra costs, even in a law level zero port, of
getting annual maintenance done on a less than legal starship.
***************
Hrm....works ok....and in GT you dont even endanger the crew and passengers
of the target...they just have to eat recycled food until they get to
port....a pirate crew could chose a liner over a merchant just on the basis
of better food :)


Vac Suits: assume one per crew member of the target, plus two
spares. Each one worth Cr10,000, pirate recoups 25% of that.
************
yep


Rescue Balls: Assume one per passenger including low berths,
Cr600 each, pirate recoups 25% of that.
************
I would leave these behind, gives a better rep.


Passenger valuables: Assume, as a minimum average, cash and other
easily convertable valuables on hand equal to the price paid for passage.
These valuables are recouped with no reduction (or the reduction is
included in the average). High passenger Cr10,000, Low passenger
Cr1000, Middle passenger Cr8,000.
************
sounds ok for an average...


Ship\'s Safe: Ships need to carry cash, they can\'t remain on-planet
long enough for credit to clear in a crisis - whether it\'s a fine that
needs
to be paid or an opportunity speculative cargo. Figure as an estimated
average, Cr25000 per 100tns of ship. Note that my only real source
for this is the Cr100,000 the _March Harrier_ had on hand at the start
of _The Traveller Adventure_, it may be much higher. This will be in
cash, recouped at 100% of value.
**************
also sounds ok...if it is a PC ship it may be much more.


Ship\'s Locker: Ignored.
**********
agreed



Cargo: The pirates will have to (very) quickly evaluate the cargo, and
guess what they have time to take. A zero-G cargo handler robot or
exoskeleton would be a very good thing here. Variation is too high
to allow a very useful average value of what can be taken, as one ship
may have two tons of gemstones while another may have nothing but
grain. I decided on allowing the pirates to recoup an average value of
Cr250 per cargo ton of the target (25% of Cr1000 per ton). This allows
some losses for travel, middlemen, and the other expenses of getting
even a valuable cargo to market.
************8
so a turn to dock, a turn to take the safe/vaccsuits/subcraft and inventory
cargo.  then per pirate (one tone/vehicle in cargo or turret strip one
turret) per turn to transfer....
using GT 20 min turns.

so a pirate with 20 boaders (in an hour) strip 2 turrets, move 4 gcarriers
and 6 airrafts..allong with 2 tons of gems and 6 tons of silver...but wind
up leaving 4 more tons of silver and 50 tons of steel behind because the
patrol is coming.

or they can skip the inventory stem and transfer 40 tons of cargo and wind
up with 250Cr/ton....if they have the time they are better off with an
inventory.



A Far or Free Trader will get him about Cr100000. A Fat Trader will get
him about MCr3 and change. Small craft are worth several MCr each.
*********
does the fat trader include the launch?




Not counting the value of the ship, the pirate needs to spend about
MCr1 a year in maintenance, salary and expenses.



Most battle damage will probably occur in an unpatrolled system,
as the stakes are higher and the target vessel is probably better armed.
*********8
and thus more likely to fight....so many pirates will try to build a
rep...if the ship fights kill everyone on it, if not let them all live and
treat the passengers with extreme curtesy


Unpatrolled systems are the only systems where a pirate will want to
fight at all -
********
agreed


Targets taken in unpatrolled systems can almost always be considered
valuable enough to cover cost of damage - unless the damage stops
the pirate from jumping back to base.
************
also agreed if you take the ship.....but you might not want to do this...if
you don\'t take the ship, they might decide to chase someone else who is
taking ships....but if they fight take them.  :) \'I am the Dread Pirate
Roberts...There will be No Survivors.\'


Therefore:
Even if a pirate has to hunt for an entire year to bag one Fat Trader,
he\'s still making reasonable money.
**********
sounds better, yeah.


There may be more efficient uses for a starship than piracy, but there are
people who cannot do legal careers for various reasons and ships they\'d
not be able to use legally. Combine the two, and you get Corsairs.
 I believe my analyses show that a pirate can make money, if the setting
IYTU allows them to survive and travel.
*************
I will be using GT...simple semi-unforgable transponders...with an on/off
switch.

unscrupulous trader captians can do a little piracy.....if they are armed
and the other ship isn\'t....very risky tho....but tempting...behind 5-6
payments to the bank, he runs across a ships boat in the outsystem...his
hold is empty...does he take it? will the crew talk?  do they suggest it?
how many payments can he make with 25% of its value?  Can he still sleep at
night?  Does he get nightmares of the pilots face as the airlock door opens
and he begs for his life?  Of course there are people who like that kind of
thing.

Does he move a few subsectors over and start a new route? stick to his old
route, and hope they locals don\'t connect him to it when he comes back in a
few months?

And once he does it the next time is even more tempting.  until he is found
out, and has to become a full time pirate....\'A short life but a merry
one.\'


and not one I would chose.
altho I did once run an anti-piracy campaign....the players imitated
merchantmen and captured the pirates.

Ummm, yes, on December 7th, 1941, in fact, it was shown rather
conclusively.

Of course, since Billy Mitchell was essentially court-martialed for
showing that aircraft could kill cap ships in the early 30\'s, the
definition of \'clear\' is somewhat open to interpretation ;-)

I still can\'t tell what the draft rules were suggesting should be the 
total modifiers to the to-hit roll for a 100 mile missile - is it
- -39 (0-hex accuracy) + 10 (point defence) = -29, but then you have to make
your roll by 10 points (ie making it the same as 0-hex non-point-defence?)

>So basically any laser-equipped ship is immune to (conventional) missile fire?
Yes. (Interestingly, G:T seems to at least partially reflect this - it looks
to me like military ships will be nearly completely immune (17- to hit on PD)
to conventional missiles (and even civilian ships will be too if they have
more than 1-2 lasers.)

Oops - you\'re right that non-evading targets drop off as range^2. G:T is 
nowhere near this - the to-hit chance seems to use the main range table,
which is -1 point for log(range)/6. 

>Evasion is part of the dodge roll.
This is more of a problem. Evading laser fire works better the further away
you are, since evasion isn\'t a matter of "jittering so hard the turret can\'t
track you" (which is impossible), but of "moving the spacecraft out of the
way of the laser pulse in the time it takes to arrive" - evasion only works
when you\'re at large enough ranges that lightspeed lag is a factor, and then
the distance you can evade goes up as range^2 and hence the size of your
evasion circle goes upas range^4. BL kind of fudged this - there was a flat
- -1 DM (halving your hit chance) for every few hexes, plus a number of DM\'s
per G for successful G\'s dedicated to evasion instead of maneuver. G:T\'s
"slow hit probability dropoff" plus "flat chance to dodge a laser bolt
regardless of range" doesn\'t model this very well (indicative of the 
problems with trying to use mechanisms developed for people bashing each other
with swords for spaceships shooting each other with laser fire.) 

Anyway, my main point is that it looks to me like hit probabilities drop
off way too gradually. Combined with the very short effective ranges of
laser weapons, the flavour is that small military ships will (nearly) always
hit out to the maximum range of their weapons.

Basically yes. (Interestingly, G:T hit probabilities seem to reflect this - 
at least for the impact missiles.) A good laser can hit a 100-G-evading 
missile-sized target out to several thousand km nearly all the time. Effective
missiles have to be fragmentation types (that detonate a thousand km out and
spread a large cloud of small fragments) for civilian use (they\'re
marginal against good PD lasers), chemical explosive lasers, or nuke det-lasers.
(Presumably these will be in future G:T modules.)

(This has been debated ad nauseum on this list and the TTL; I would suggest
anyone who wishes to continue to debate it meet me on the TTL.)

This is still too slow - 10-fold increase in range should be either 1/100 ort
1/10000 the hit probability, depending on whether things are accuracy-dominated
or evasion-dominated (with the latter being more common.) Still, it\'s hard
to get this right with d6 - or even d100, until someone invents logarithmic
dice - so it\'s a minor point. I\'d have to play with it more - it just looks
like too soft a drop-off to me, but I may be wrong.

>using standard GURPS rules we add velocity to range.
Why would one do this? How does the velocity of something in a space combat
situation - especially something that\'s heading straight towards you - make
it harder to hit?

At the risk of fanning the flames...

     I personally find this sort of post to be rather offensive to me as a
TML\'r.  I don\'t see where anything terribly offensive was posted by the
previous person.  In fact, there is at least a question of wether or not a
statistically significant number of people involved w/ the Clinton
Administration have passed on in curious circumstances.  As far as Traveller
goes, weren\'t their similar questions as to the rise of Lucan to the throne of
the Imperium, over the still-twitching body of his brother?

     Traveller is indeed a game, and as such is fictional.  However it, like
everything else in our lives, is shaped by things around us.  In the "Real
World", all is not sweetness and light.  If your personal belief is that King
Richard was a kind-hearted old man, thats fine...even though it doesn\'t square
with history or reality ( he was a major leader of the Crusades; rape and
pillage, because God is on your side)  But the rest of us are entitled to
present our opinions and thoughts as we see fit, without having to worry about
being shouted down for it.

 Probably true (I could possibly find out for sure, but, if I then posted

 The question is, what size warheads would _fit_ on a standard-sized

It is true...the Soviet Union announced in the late 1950\'s (and it was
confirmed by declassified docs after the fall of Communism) that they had
constructed a 100Mt "doomsday" bomb.  I do not believe it was ever test-
detonated though...and certainly was not deployed to any weapons system.

No no no. That was their point. It wasn\'t clear that in a standup battle with
battleships in the mix that battleships would be defeated by carrier air. PH
was a special case (no war footing, Sunday morning, etc). Midway was a special
case (no real battleships involved; it was carrier versus carrier).

Only later in the war did it bcome clear that battleships were out of the
running.

This translation is both silly sounding and confusing, because

"Sternhafen" is a commonly used word in german sci-fi literature.

That would be correct but (imo) sounds silly, so i\'m not using a direct

Konzern would be right.  Konzernherrschaft means "a company that rules" and

I haven\'t actually seen anything about a nuclear briefcase.  However, I used
to be studying to be a cold warrior and used to know all sorts of things about
nuclear weapons strategy and tactics, especially when a limited nuclear
"warfighting" capability was a topic of discussion in the nuke community.
(Damn Gorbachev! ;-)

Most details, long forgotten.  But . . .
IIRC, you need something like 3-4 feet of tunnel/tube.chamber to get the fired
mass to high enough energy so that it will get the proper reaction.

I think the "Nuclear Briefcase" is actually what was called by the US Army
(although perhaps not officially) the "Nuclear Bullet."

It wasn\'t a bullet at all but a very large backpack weighing in excess of
120 pounds.  It was awkward to carry, due to its length, but it was
one-man-portable. (120lbs is the same load a fireman carries when
fully rigged up).  And there used to be some in the former West
Germany.

I don\'t know what the megaton/kiloton yield would be.  Especially
after you subtract the load of the non-reacting components of the
device, which, IIRC, where quite heavy themselves.  Say it was
20 kg or 45lbs of reaction mass.  What would the yield be?

no,  bottom of page 168 ramming craft cannot dodge.  and generaly point

I wonder if Marc knows what Lucan is up to. ;->  Loren are you keeping

Maybe, but I don\'t think so. I think GT has to avoid even the merest
hint of "the rebellion" and "virus" by contract. What I think happened
is that IIS did its job this time and discovered the plot before Dulinor
made it to Capital.

Hum...

a. Who says Dulinor is actually dead? Where\'s the definitive proof that
the ArchDuke was really on that cutter when it was destroyed? Sure, our
suspicions are that Strephon or loyal Internal Security forces destroyed
the cutter, but what if it didn\'t happen that way. What if Dulinor got
word that his plot was blown, and decided he had better "disappear?" 
Maybe *he* destroyed the cutter to cover his escape. He might be out
there somewhere, on the run, plotting, even trying to get to the Zhodani
for political asylum. Who knows what he might be up to.

b. Maybe Lucan was implicated in the plot, but Uncle Strephon can\'t
prove anything. Lucan certainly moved fast enough in the MT universe.
Maybe he had been in on it, then double crossed Dulinor...that fits him
if you ask me. Or maybe in *this* universe Lucan changed his mind, lost
his nerve, and spilled the beans on the plot.

I agree that the "grand tour" is a cover, but a cover for what...maybe
Varian has been charged with hunting down the renegade Dulinor?  Or
checking out what\'s happening in Zhodani/Vargr space? Or again who knows
what!

Again, I don\'t think SJG can use *anything* connected with Virus, but
I\'d be just as happy if they dropped the Cymbeline angle and ditched the
whole Deyo transponder business, as if it never existed.

I suspect there will be some sort of upheaval, and it\'s going to spill
over into the Imperium. The Imperium needs to be shaken not destroyed. I
think it also needs a real frontier, but I don\'t know where that might
be.  Of course, the area rimward of the Solomani Sphere is still
unexplored territory.

Yep, I wouldn\'t be surprised to eventually see an attack coming from the
solomani rim. Nor would I be surprised if we just get internal unrest
along the borders of both polities.

Come on Steve, you don\'t expect Loren to tell you either way do you?

If Loren and SJG can make the GTverse entertaining enough, they might
even lure me into playing there.

Remember that there is a -2 modifier for each missile after the first.

Try using inverse range^2 instead and see what happens.

Personnally, I don\'t thing laser bolts should be dodgeable at all.  The
lightspeed lag at laser ranges will be minimal... point and shoot.  That\'s
being realistic.  At some point you have to drop the realism (as I did with
the missiles).  Therefore I allow the dodge, for reasons more of making the
fight more interesting.

Capitol ships will probably be more likely to really be fighting with their
spinal mounts, no?  It\'s pretty easy to sock on enough armor and/or
sandcasters to invalidate laser fire... so the lasers get used for point
defense and attacking fighters.

The Regency is the Domain of Deneb; it consists of the Spinward Marches, 
Deneb, Trojan Reaches, and portions of Reft Sectors.  They call it the area

Considering the position of the Hierate in relation to the new 4I centered at 
Terra, it looks like they might fight the Aslan Border Wars all over again as 
soon as they start feeling froggy again.  This means head to head in the Dark 
Nebula & Reavers\' Deep sectors, as seen by Sollie incursions into RD during 
the Rebellion, only on a bigger scale.  IMTU (Reavers\' Deep ca. 1125), the 
first phases of this are already happening in that the Sollies are backing 
pirate gangs, if not actively hiding their flags and acting like pirates, the 
resulting shipping losses are taking their toll on the general overall 
stability of several regimes in the area.

Yeah; the death of Force Z (Prince of Wales, Repulse) on Dec.9th 1941. Land
based torpedo bombers sank them both within a hour. Force Z was caught without
air cover. Only a couple of planes were shot down. POW had a modern DP

Well, there\'s a limit to how many PD attacks you can do with a particular
weapon system.  It appears to be fairly practical to saturate point defense,
particularly with missile bays.

If you tied Mike Tyson up, I could probably beat him up.  While Pearl

While I don\'t know if it\'s the way it\'s supposed to work (but I suspect it
it is) I certainly don\'t add full speed modifiers when a target is heading
straight at/away from the firer (or within a few degrees of that.) (Instead
I modify the range with half the speed, figuring for ease of use that the
firer shoots at about halfway into the \'turn\'. Or, just as likely, I ignore
the whole thing and just eyeball it. ;-)

At other angles it\'s actually a reasonably clever way (given the way the
table is designed) to abstract the fact that if the speed is 1000yps it
doesn\'t really matter much whether the target is 50 or 100 meters away. And
likewise, if something is 1000 meters away, it doesn\'t really matter much
whether it moves at 1 yps or 2 yps. It certainly isn\'t perfect, but it\'s
easy to use and gives reasonable results. (The table also takes size into
account.)

Is Dulinor dead? this is a biggie. If Dulinor is dead did Strephon (away at 
Longbow) order him killed, I think thats unlikely (timeframes all wrong). Its far 
more likely that Imperial security forces acted on initiative.

Varian? Well just what do we actually know about Varian? Not a lot. In MT he 
had the "good" fortune to be killed and become a martyr, but we don\'t actually 
know a lot about his personality. There is no evidence that he was any better 
than Lucan. Given that the Imperium chose not to train the 3rd in line for the 
throne (utter stupidity),  can\'t see any reason why the 2nd in line would have 
been either. All we know was that he stole his twin brother\'s girlfriend and got 
into a shouting match over it. Not a lot to go on really. My take on Varian is 
that he was just as much a spoilt brat as Lucan, just he got killed and thus 
history makes him the noble martyr.

I would be very happy to see the abomination of the Deyo transponder, 
Cymbeline chips and the Virus forever banished to the depths of TNE were they 
belong (no offense guys, I just don\'t like them).

Lets get something straight abot Strephon. He may be very noble and 
honourable. But in MT he was clearly shown to be an utter incompetant. He left 
Capital leaving no contingancies for any "accidents". Just what would have 
happened if his clone had had an air/raft crash while he was away? He 
apparently didn\'t tell anybody he was going. When the rebellion broke out he 
was so guilty striken that he chose not to prove his identity. etc etc etc..... 
Make no mistakes Strephon may have been honourable, but he was an 
honourable fool.

given the ship assumption, no argument here. However 600td craft with a bay

I\'d say you\'d probably be able to part it out for at least 25%. More work,
but still doable.

Again, if you have the connections, part them out for about 40% of value.

sounds good.

Any pirate taking away the crew\'s vacc suits is going to acquire QUITE a
rep, and probably quite a bounty paid by donations from passengers and
crews affected.

probably could recoup 50% or more with streetwise tasks.

I\'d use 3d-3 * 10% of annual maintenance costs, plus a base of roughly
Cr2500 per td of cargo capacity (based upon ammounts in my various
merchantile campaigns).

Kidnapping for any purpose could trigger imperial attentions. Something

aside from the bits about taking spacesuits (which are generally somewhat

Classical traveller has combat ranges of a lightsecond or two, at which
point lightspeed lag is significant (a 6-G ship can move 480 meters in
four seconds of there-and-back-again time.) I think evading laser fire
is somewhat reasonable; I just don\'t like GT\'s interpretation - evading 
should (a) require you to set aside some G\'s that aren\'t available for
maneuver, and (b) become more successful at greater ranges.

I was thinking more of small military ships - escorts, frigates, destroyers.

(if I\'m reading it right) to be quite low...consider a civilian ship:

Firing at a 400-ton target (+9 size) at 7 hexes (-43) it hits only on a 3.
At 2 hexes it hits on a 5-. Civilian ships will have to plink away a long
time to hit anything...

Even a military ship (gunner 14, targeting +10) only has an adjusted gunnery
of 44 - vs an 800-ton target at 7 hexes it\'s only hitting a third of the time.
So the short weapon ranges and low accuracy abotu cancel out. Small-ship
combat only happens at very close ranges - and hence only when one ship
has a big acceleration advantage or both ships are looking for a fight.

In point defence mode, the military ship gets 44 - 39 (0 hex) + 10 (PD) for a
15- ; it usually hits incoming missiles. Because of the way the PD rules
allow multiple shots (each additional missile a single turret enganges is at -2),
having three or four turrets is nearly 100% protection against the same number
of missiles. If there are three missiles, each turret gets one shot at 
15- at one missile, a second at 13- at another, a third at 11- at the third - 
each missile has to survive a 15-, 13- and 11- and hence has little chance of
hitting. (Vs. a civilian ship the shots would be 10-, 8-, and 6- - life is 
a little better for the missile (about a quarter of missiles will get through.)

These are not as high to-hit numbers as I initially thought they were (unless
I\'m doing something wrong) - in fact, they seem too low; GURPS lasers must
not be very accurate :-)

UH...heat IS light.  Inferred light.  That is want heat is.  And there are
IR lasers avalable today.  The problem is convertion.  A chemical catalist
laser could in theory convert waste heat to collumated IR.  Also there is
the other question as to how much waste heat a TL12 Fusion reacter has.  If
it\'s low and the insulation facter is high then there would be no need to
vent heat at all.  The color temperture difference between the hull an space
could be less than 1 degree.

Again it depends on the amount of waste heat.  You need some to warm the
crew spaces to begin with.  If the waste heat is not greater than that there
is no waste heat.

I ment that your sensor would have to be \'in the arc\' and facing in the
right direction so you would need quite a few with good networking to get a
location fix.  You\'d need at least three widely separated on all three axis
to narrow it down to a reasonable area.

Historically pirates were mutineers and criminals of various stripes.  They
did not run because they were wanted to many places to do so.  They did not
build ships except for privateers which are NOT pirates and were the nature
of this discussion when I first brought it up.  Pirates generally stole
ships, captured and converted ships, or aquired them be mutinee.

With a high Delta V and cold gas manuvering thruster it would not be a

Not necessarily.  Planets move as do solar systems.  The best spot to enter
depends on many things including Delta V and landing point.  IF the pirate

I would they spend those credits if it were not needed?  And what would be

Not really,  From all I have read the number of ship (1000 per sector) is
not all that high.  Once you figure formations you end up with 200 small
squadrons of even less larger squadrons for 400+ worlds.

But that depends on your assumtions.  If you ASSUME that the 1% is for ALL
empirial spending you end up with a different story.  Or if you ASSUME that
1% has to include all ground forces, airforces, logistics, and auxilleries
then you end up with a different set of numbers.  These are all assumtions
not canon.  The only canon we have is cross version.  Is there enough canon
in any one version of the TU to figure the budget for that version?  I have
CT and T4.  In T4 you loose military money if you spend it else where.
Maybe they are spending the money in \'inferstructure\'.  You can also have
your economy take a down turn due the social problems.  Maybe CT was in a
recession?  Or mabe the Marches where I usually play is a haven for pirates
but no the encounter table is in the basic books not the SM book.

OR mabe the writter goofed and left out some obvious point like the military
ships were \'down\' for repairs or R&R 50% of the time like the US military is
with it\'s planes.  Or maybe the writers did not fully understand the
implications of their material.  A simple error like say the 2LS detection
range only applies to ships with active manuver drives. Or that the military
has \'down time\' would help to explain it.  Or maby the cost to maintain
those military ships goes up as they age like the civilian ships?

Looks like I know what I\'ll be reading ing the \'reading room\' for a
while....There has to be simple answer hear somewhere that we are just
overlooking.  The sensor stuff, is it canon of just third party?  if 2LS is
it for a running drive that could explain a lot.  The \'down for repairs\'
could deal with the military.  After all 1/12th have to be at a military
base one month our of the year for their overhaul plus the travel time frim
their patrol routes to and from the base...

something wrong here.

surface area of a circle = 4PI X r^2

4PI x 1,800,000,000^2 = 4.07e^19 square meters or 4.07e^16 square km or
1357168026351 hexes of surface area.  Remember it\'s a sphere not a circle
and you have to do the calculation in units.

1k for example

1^2=1

1000^2=1000000=100k



>A range 16 active EMS has a long range of 64 hexes which is more than 100

Ok, I don\'t play TNE (I miss the release and have not tried to get the OOP
books sence) so I have to ask...

1) How many hexes can one sensor actively scan in one hour?  Your text above
says that it can be detected at that range but it does not say how long it
takes to scan a sphere 1,800,000 km in diameter.  If memory serves that\'s 6
ls or 12 ls round trip time for the signal.  Assuming a 1\' of arc scan
(unlikely to be that high a resolution at that range) per scan and a 12
second delay that makes a spherical active scan take 432 hours.

2) What kind of signal is this sensor sending out to bounce off of the
target?  Remember for a non collumated emission that power drops by the
inverse square law.  Note that our deep space probes today use a high gain
narrow field antenia to send the data back to us and even then the signal is
way down in the mud.  A spherical pulse is unlikely and one powerfull enough
would do bad things to the planet below\'s TV sets and any living thing on
the ship.  If the above active sensor is lidar you are stuck with the above
delay times and a much narrower aperture than 1\'.  Most lazers dispersion
out at much less that .01\'  High speed mirrors and good hardware might give
you 1\' per 12 second but I really dought it.

I have no dought that you can resolve a target at that range.  I have a
dought that you can find it to resolve unless picked up on passive sensors
which rely on target signal emmissions that loose strength by the inverse
square law meaning that a marginally stealthy ship at that range would be
producing a detectable signal strength at the recieving sensor so far down
in the mud that it would be all but undectable.  A half hour per attempt the
lock on to a object at that range would be about right if the operater had a
very good idea where to look.

1357168026351/3200 = 424115008 that\'s a lot of ships.  If it took 1 ship a
half hour to scan 3200 hexes and move on it would take one ship  24,207
years to scan  the surface of the jump sphere of a system.  Care to take a
guess at how long it would take to search the entire volume?

Seperate power systems.  It works out better.  You can also have a basic
power unit componet the includes the start up overhead and extra power unit
componets to add to them to avaoid the overhead.  Then you just add the
right number of components for your power needs.  You can also add a back up
system this way or devide the power plant in to two or more small reacters.
Something you can\'t do in the current system.  I like redundancy in critical
systems.

No, I\'ve droped the idea as unworkable.  The math just does not make it.

What\'s a little fraud to murderers?  Great idea.  Run this sting a few times

What are your scan TIMES based on the volume of the sphere you are scaning?
Being able to detect is one thing but if it takes to long.  At long ranges
your angles of resolution becomes a problem so the scan beam must be limited
once limited and time lag kicks in you have finite limits on scan time or do
you propose a scan beam that travels faster than light?  

What is the signal your active sensor puts out?  Light?  Radar?  Meson?  

What is the detection threshold of the sensor?  nLs?  nWs?

How does it distinquish between background noise and beam return?
Polarization?   Carrier wave?  If so what it the frequency?  

What is it\'s aperture angle for reception at it\'s rated sensitivity?  Can be
360 degrees and be mounted on anything and you reach molucular limits were
on molicules size is to large to resolve target x and distance y.

Nah, the problem is that GURPS gunners can\'t use the accuracy (limited to Acc =
skill).  If you let them use the full accuracy of the laser hitting is _not_ a
problem (TL 10 at max range (range -45), Acc 33, Cx6 targeting program, size +8
target (100 td), skill 14, hit on 17-).  This was a deliberate decision in
writing up GT space combat (not one I much like, but deliberate).

Well, they only call for one pilot on the scout.  Who\'s driven when he\'s
sleeping?  (Grin!)  In truth they do look a little low for combat ships.
Space battles are likely to take a lot of time and while one crew could
fight a 1 hour battle what shape would they be in after 10 hours or 2 days?
Transit time from the gas giant to the main would could be long.

A lasers beam spreads over great distances.  I typical comercial 1 watt unit
today would cast a circle about 1.5 feet in diameter on the moon.  Far
enough out and your much better ships laser would not have any effect but if
you could target the array you could blind or burn it out at ranges 100s of
times greater than combat distances.  It\'s the targeting at that range that
is a problem even if the beam is 1 meter in diameter hiting a 10 meter
target with a 1 meter beam at 10^8+ (1ls)  meters is not that easy.  The
angle of resolution on your turret motors at that range could be 10000+
meters.  Did you buy a turet that could resolve 10^-12 degrees of arc while
moving multiton weapons and sensors to measure that arc and computers fast
enough to calculate the 3d vectored velocities in real time as your ship
moves 3000 meters a second and your target 300 meters a second?  People
often forget the scale of space combat.  If you targeted a large enough area
then the energy would be to defused and with the limits on resolution the
sensor could be in a spot you completly skip over.  In the mean time you are
giving them a very good misile target to aim at.  They\'ll take a while to
get there though.

Hm..well, there\'s no real cap to the amount of computer power you could link up
for the purpose, so it sort of depends on what you interpret as the complexity
of the filtering task; probably order 2-3.  As far as phased-array sensors,
though, what is the actual complexity of signal integration?  Somehow I suspect
it\'s second-order in sensitivity _and_ first-order (or worse) in the number of
sensors, which winds up at 100x weight for +0.5 sensitivity once again.

Actually, all Pearl Harbor "proved" was that planes could sink
undefended ships sitting at anchor in a harbor. For that matter, the
British already "proved" this at Taranto a year earlier.

The "proof" that planes could sink prepared and ready battleships at
sea came when the Japanese sank Prince of Wales and Repulse.

The British should have known better, too. Off of Crete the Luftwaffe
proved decisively that ships could not adequately defend themselves
from air attack. The RN had several cruisers and destroyers sunk, and
at least one carrier and battleship each were severely damaged by the
land based dive bombers.

I was experimenting somewhat with fixing some of the gurps sensor rules, and
ran across a question I was sort of guessing at an answer to...

How does the range at which an object\'s shape can be resolved, and the range at
which it can be detected as a point of light, compare?  This is assuming
objects which are visible by reflected light, not luminous objects; obviously,
this depends on albedo and brightness, assume earth-normal sunlight and an
albedo of around .2.

Against the ground, these distances are pretty much the same, pending some
major anti-chameleon effect.  In space they\'re pretty clearly not the same, but
I was wondering what the actual distance was.  Also, how much IR sensors are
improved by not being in atmosphere...

Based on their standard rules for ground spotting, I needed to give a bonus of
at least 200x for space (otherwise normal people can\'t see stars, which is
probably bad...), but I was wondering if there\'s any good numbers.

A Jump-4 \'catcher ship\' under HG would have only 160 tons of \'unallocated\' space for such anemities as a bridge, crew staterooms, weapons, etc.  Remember, just the jump fuel requirements of a 600 dt ship is on the order of 240 dt.  So, your \'catcher ship\' might be able to run, but it won\'t run *far*.

What about the simple use of an umbrela?  A big one opened between the ship
and the sensor.  The material would be a space normal temperture as niether
side is at room temperture and the nice cold barrier block all sight of the
radiators in the back of the ship.  With than much surface area any small
amount of stray ir that hit it would be defused and reradiated at a much
lower temp.  If the umbrela was radar transparent  (no metal) it would not
add the the sensor aspect of the ship itself.  If it were also transparent
to light in one direction then lidar could not see it OR the ship behind it.
And yes this is posible.  There are materials like that today used in widows.

Also, do the ships like the merchant ship or scout ship count against the

characters pool points for the ship and be co-owners.  Seems easy enough.

Is it just me?  Probably.  Where are the costs and weights for ammo other

fudging the weight.  I cannot find them anywhere in the book.

By the way, the hardback GURPS Traveller and hardback GURPS Basic rules are

The problem is here in the UK too... I\'m surprised that there is a packing
issue in the UK as well.

GW have had significant problems with binding before, even though it that
was in the good old days -

Hardbacks which fell apart - Stormbringer 2nd Ed, RuneQuest (Griffin
Island), WH40k, WH 3rd edition and a few others whose names now escape me.

I hope it has improved - their mail order used to suck badly.

The US designed two nifty `more-bang-for-the-buck\' weapons - the Atomic
Demolition Munition, and the Special Atomic Demolition Munition.

The ADM was a large device, with a yield in the 100s of kt to Mt,
designed to be used by the Engineers to, say, level a forest; destroy a
mountain pass, whatever.

The SADM was the pack weapon, for use by special forces. It could take
out a dam or other large, hard target. Yield was 10s of kt, IIRC.

part of Gordon R. Dickson\'s "Childe Cycle" that has been

Novels").  This query concerns a connection between them and
Traveller.

The published information on the Solomani seems to suggest that,
at least in the area that eventually became the Solomani
Confederation, it was not unusual for cultural groups to settle
planets, and remain monocultural.  This would potentially allow
the preservation of "ancient tradition" and the development of
the culture with minimal "interference".

This is what also seemed to happen in Dickson\'s universe - except
that instead of specific _cultures_ being transplanted and
established, he hypothesizes that specific types of personality
would do so - the Dorsai are the archetypical warrior/soldier;
the Exotics are the archetypical mystics, the Friendlies are the
archetypical faithholder, the Newtonians are the archetypical
scientists, the Cetans are the archetypical businessmen, and so
on.  His thesis is that these types needed to develop on their
own, and become "self-sustaining", to eventually breed back
together into "full-spectrum" man - the type of man that
originally came from Earth, only the "next stage of evolution".
Paul Formain/Donal Graeme/Hal Mayne was certainly one of these.

Does anyone feel that this concept has a place in Traveller?  If
so, how, and what would the individual cultures and archetypes
be?  How would they "fit in" to the rest of the Traveller
universe, and where (my guess would be in Solomani space)?  How
would this affect rebuilding after the Collapse?  Etc.?

I suspect this is because it would drive home to the players the
uncomfortable realization that their "noble adventurers" are really just
racist, heavily-armed burglars and killers.  :/

For the space/cost of a missile bay you can get 50 laser turrets with 150 
lasers total. The 10 turrets/1 bay/1000 tons limit will mean that maxed-out
ships only get 30 lasers per missile bay, which is a little more saturatable.

Also, the text is inconsistent/unclear about how many missiles a bay can 
control (one place implies it has 2 communicators, the other 50 communicators)
and how many gunners it needs (if it has 50 communicators, can it still be run
by only one person?) 

The high-end military will probably be done with GVE2 I suppose (which I 
guess I\'ll have to buy) - dedicated point-defence lasers with high ROF and
short range vs fully-independent or terminal-homing missiles.

And they are really nasty weapons - just sail your ship into any major

The really scary thing was being told a story about some of the UK\'s

That personal belief would be quite dumb since Richard died in his late 30s
IIRC.
Richard\'s own contemporaries thought him to be quite ruthless and
unscrupulous.  He\'s mostly held to be a bad King, a bad son, and a bad
husband, but he was an awesome warrior.

That kind of villifies the whole crusading movement, which is your right, of
course...  Others might look to the heroism, chivalry and courage (on all
sides) of the movement.  Certainly the Crusades were manned by an inordinate
amount of penniless adventurers on the make, but there were many who were
quite wealthy and powerful in Europe and had no practical reasons to embark on
such an expensive and arduous expedition...

"Rape and pillage" was synonymous w/ warfare well until (and even during) the
20th century.  The Vilani were always ruthless (using biologicals and nukes,
etc)... i don\'t see them raping as a matter of course, but i have trouble
envisioning medieval Vilani period.   ; )  I generally try not to judge others
based on modern morality and culture.

I think it\'s fairly likely he\'s dead.  I\'m very skeptical of Dulinor finding
refuge outside of the Imperium and there only in his own domain would Dulinor
be safe... maybe a second Ilelish revolt is brewing... but Hutara has
apparently been gotten to, as well as power being handed to his daughter...
Did Dulinor raise a loyal daughter?

Of course, most of the relevant Virus research isn\'t well under way until the

"It was one of the few unambiguous examples of the reception of psionic
signals across interstellar distances, and was dramatic enough and connected
to enough other events that it required the emperor\'s personal attention."
Regency SB, pg 83.

The "other events" would be the Zhodani Core expeditions, and evidence of
space combat along the axis as well as several Longbow stations going
inexplicably silent after the Wave passed over them.  There definately
appeared to be a possible threat to the Imperium.

So yes, the clone *was* the emperor\'s contingency plan for him being gone.
The fault in Strephon was not seeing how great Dulinor\'s resentment was and
the drastic action\'s he\'d have taken (and that resulted from his death).  If
he had been there, he\'d have died.   
The other, basic, fault was to go to Usdiki instead of Capital on news of the
assassination, but Survival Margin talks of this, as well. : )

His intelligence and security apparatus failed (though it\'s dubious how they
could\'ve stopped Dulinor anyways).  Dulinor had some awesome planning and
preparation.  It was only the failure to get Lucan and Varian killed that
prevented him from being Emperor...  I think a much better "alternate"
universe (as much as I abhore the concept) would have been for Volante Imprey
to have plugged Lucan and Varian (and maybe Elia) before eating the guard\'s
SMG bullets.  Dulinor makes him a posthumous hero and then becomes ruler of
the newly stabalized and people-oriented <g> 3I.  *I\'d* have arranged for a
company of the Ilelish Guard to pay a visit to Lucan and Varian just after i
pull the trigger.

"...The gravity of this information, combined with uncertainty of the security
of the important Longbow headquarters prevented Strephon from accurately
referring to this journey, (Survival Margin pg 13, TD 15)..."-RSB pg 83.
\'That information\' would be the EMS/psionic phenomenon,the Zho troubles, the
now silent forward Longbow stations, and the fact that the wavefront would
reach the Imperial border in 1205.

> Make no mistakes Strephon may have been honourable, but he was an

The situation blew up out of his control.  The only real fault (aside from not
spotting Dulinor\'s rather extreme disatisfaction) was not immediately trying
to regain the reigns at Capital, but going to Usdiki and letting Lucan
consolidate his position.

Perhaps a basic thermodynamics text is in order? The readers-digest version
is that if you use 100 watts of waste heat to pump a laser (somehow), you
generate more than 100 watts of heat in the machinery used for the pumping. 
(The details are more complicated, but basically, laser refrigeration doesn\'t
work. The only good way to get rid of heat is radiate it in an old-fashioned
black-body.)

The assumption in FFS2 is about 10% (a much-debated topic). One should note
that not just waste from the reactor, but heat from all sorts of sources
needs to be radiated. For example, if your 10 MW laser is 20% efficient,
you have 8 MW of misc. heat to get rid of...Or the 10 MW that goes into your
life support, or grav compensators, or computers...

Note that even warming the crew quarters generates a signature; a 300 K
hull is fairly easy to detect against black space. Lurking pirates need to
actively refrigerate and/or insulate their hulls so that the hulls are 50-200K,
and somehow get rid of all the sunlight the (black) hull soaks up, and the
heat that is keeping the crew warm => more waste heat.

This statement is simply not true (in many ways.) As a minor point, noise
in cameras is not the limiting factor in astronomical imaging (and hasn\'t
been for a while); noise due to random fluctuations in the sky background
dominates. And, no matter what the noise is, if that noise is random you
can improve your signal-to-noise and detection threshold by adding 
multiple images (each with different random noise) together. I *know* this
to be a fact; I do it for a living and add images together on a daily
basis. Whether the images are successive ones taken by one telescope
are multiple ones taken by different telescopes is irrelevant.
When I add four images together I can see things that weren\'t present in
the single images (in fact, about twice as faint as the limit for the
previous images.) 

>Not mirror.  A good black coating and surface angles to defect what is not

It\'s hard to get a black coating that doesn\'t have some diffuse reflection - 
ie some fraction of the light gets scattered in all directions no matter
what the angle of reflection is. This kind of stealthing works much better
in radar where diffuse reflection isn\'t an issue. 

>What are your scan TIMES based on the volume of the sphere you are scaning?
TL8 Passive-light sensors can be visualized as taking a series of pictures
every ten seconds or so, each picture being about 10 degrees on a side,
with perhaps an 8192x8192 pixel detector with 4 arcsecond pixels. It scans
the whole sky about once per hour. Remember, a passive scan isn\'t scanning
volume but the 2-d projected image of the sky...

It\'s probably second-order in number of elements, but doesn\'t care about 
sensitivity (you don\'t process every photon, but time-average over a bunch of
photons, in your electronics rather than in the computer.) SO big sensor 
arrays have to make their individual elements bigger as well as adding more
elements (ie a x100 bigger sensor has ten times as many elements, each ten
times as big with ten times as much computer power per element...)

God knows where you got this number from; to make a 1.5\' circle on the
moon you\'d need a diffraction-limited 800-meter telescope to launch the laser.
Perhaps 1.5 miles is closer to the mark?

Actually, targeting stationary/constant-velocity objects is pretty easy
(see various earlier discussions in the archives.)

10 meters at 10^8 meters is only 6x10^-6 degrees of arc, but that\'s a nit.
The trick to getting such accuracies is not to track the whole turret to
those precisions but to move the turret for coarse aiming and do fine aiming
with a smaller precision steering mirror in your laser. If you have a boresighted
sensor looking along the same light path (with a beamsplitter or moving mirror
to switch between the laser and the sensor) you can track the target 
"closed-loop". Similar systems (ie the closed-loop tip/tilt tracking system 
for a big modern telescope) already achieve 10^-6 degree tracking accuracy.
The hard part about hitting targets with lasers isn\'t the inherent accuracy,
it\'s lightspeed lag and dodging.

This isn\'t a bad trick, although it has to be shiny on its sun-facing
side (otherwise it heats up), and so only protects from one direction...
and of course it still has to be pretty black on its target-facing side. 

Deployed umbrella-type shields are probably worth about an additional -0.5 or
so to IR signature. Their visible signature will be calculated normally 
depending on the material you make them out of (so, if they\'re military
ultrablack, they\'ll be pretty expensive.)

Outside of the 60 degree arc the umbrella is protecting against, add 1.5 to
visible light signature. (Maybe 1.0)

Well, inherent accuracy is quite possibly a problem if _you_ are dodging, but
this is more a stabilization issue than anything else.  There\'s a reasonable
argument for adjusting accuracy based on whether or not the firing ship is
manuevering (thus, you can have two ships, both evading, missing each other all
day long; or, they can both not evade, and hit every time out to the maximum
range of their weapons..).

What happens if rather than using HG one uses a vector movement system and
a board? While the BRs will still get the Tigeress it wouldn\'t be so neat
if the Tigeress in the meantime blew away the tender (and some of the BRs,
of course).

BTW has anyone ever tried a battle between a BR equipped BatRon and a BB
BatRon, complete with all escorts, etc? It\'d be interesting to see the
results, especially from a vector based system like Battle Rider (with
fixes, of course). You see, it occured to me that the BR \'Ron would have to
tie up escorts looking after the tender, while the BB \'Ron could use them
more aggressively.

Personally I feel the 3I\'s use the battle riders is obviously the result of
the Hawks and the accountants ganging up on the rest. BRs are better than
BBs for offensive work, but suffer in defence becuase of the inability to
run away (though they do make fine SDBs if you buy more than you have jump
capacity for - is there anything in canon for this? Everything I\'ve seen
suggests that BRs are always bought complete with Tender). The accountant
like \'em because they give lots of firepower for your credit.

BL\'s -1DM/3 hexes isn\'t linear, because each -1DM halves your success chance.

_Fighting Ships of the Shattered_ makes it pretty clear that a BatRon is a
group of BBs plus escorts, including escort cruisers, etc. I\'ve always
assumed that these probably came from a CruRon that was so assigned.

IMO while battle riders have better tactical flexibility, they lack the
\'operational\' flexibilty that BBs have because they only have the one jump
drive, so you can\'t readily split your squadron, and because a BR squadron
needs more escorts inorder to protect the tender.

Note that skill 13 is rather low. Remember that in GURPS, weapon skills
are scaled differently than non-weapon skills. Thus, while 13 is between
"rather skilled" and "well trained" for normal skills, for weapon
skills (see the bottom of p. B45) skill 12 is "novice", skill 15 is
"veteran" and an actual expert is skill 18. See Meaning of Skills, p. B45.

In the Spinward Marches in 1120, I would expect that the average gunner on
a merchant ship is a recently retired or mustered out naval rating who had
served in a planetary or colonial naval force. 

Gunner skills also recieve a +1 bonus for IQ 11 or +2 for IQ 12.

While some ships may indeed operate with gunners with skill 12-13, I
expect an effort may be made to hire gunners with higher skills.
Considering the 1000-ship naval fleets (and uncounted escorts) that are
canon in the Imperium, to say nothing of the SDB fleets, finding former
naval gunners would not be very hard at all ... most would also have
useful electronics skills, and could presumably double as shipboard
security, stewards, etc. while the ship was in jump.

This is the apparent assumption of GURPS Traveller, since merchants have
no gunnery skill in their template. It was certainly the way most free
traders operated in the games I\'ve been in.

The standard naval enlisted template gives Gunner-16 for a gunnery branch
specialist. NPCs may have slightly lower skill; nevertheless, it means
that for an engagement between a merchant free trader with the usual
"ex-navy gunner" at the turret the engagement chance, even with civilian
targeting software, jumps from 5 or less at 2 hex range to 11 or less.

Again, I suspect that naval vessels would make an effort to produce
quality crew. Remember, GT is set 10 years after the Fifth Frontier War.
Those ratings who remained in service likely have combat experience and
are now petty officers in charge of the big guns. Moreover, many turrets
and probably most bays are operated by veterans (skill 15-16). Certainly
the fellow commanding the spinal mount will be pretty good... if you can\'t
find a spinal mount gunner in your crew of 200 or whatever with skill
15-16, you probably need a new first officer -- training standards are
slipping.

Note that skill 17-18 would indeed be very rare ... but in the Imperial
Navy and those sector navies on the front line, I\'d say skill 15-16 is
more the rule than the exception. Among pirates and planetary navies, and
backwater sector navies I\'d say skill 14 is more likely.

These were the assumptions on which the game numbers were determined. From
a game perspective (does anyone actually *play* rather than make economic 
and scientific calcuations?), they also allow a crew of PCs based around
the recommended templates to more effectively handle low skill NPCs. A
game in which the PCs could hit the enemy on a 16 or less but the enemy
could hit them on a 12 or less means that PCs in a smaller vessel have
little chance. A game in which the PCs have around a modified 11 or
less to hit while the ungodly hit on a 7 or less is one in which a
small ship with a good crew can survive long enough to reach a jump point
get rescued, or inflict some damage on the enemy...

So the assumption is, basically, that merchant crews will be mainly
ex-navy with skill 13-15 (much like many airliners in the US are piloted
by former air force...) and that naval skills will tend to be similar,
perhaps 13-15 in planetary up to 14-16 in imperial navy. The merchant
gunners may be out of practice but the navy blokes are usually younger, so
it evens out. If you disagree with these assumptions, add +2 to the basic
hit chance for every every skill point below these assumptions.

Another point is that on an airplane (or a ship, for that matter)
there are prefered directions. In such a case you know that it is
safe (more or less) to reradiate the radar pulse, say, UP. In space
angled hulls (like an F-117) make no sense unless you decide to point
the prefered direction towards the guy looking for you--you have to
know where he is, and there can\'t be too many others around that are
off-axis. If I took an F-117 and presented you with the bottom of
the aircraft as your sensor target, it wouldn\'t be stealthy at all
(by virtue of reflection, anyway).

That said, a pirate simply trying to hide from a merchant can use
this as long as there isn\'t a dispersed planetary sensor system to
deal with--there\'s another thought for you pirates... BRIBE THE
SENSOR OPERATOR. At your class E starports, this shouldn\'t be too
hard to do, the guy is probably assigned to it because he was a
troublemaker in the first place :-)

Considering that the other cultures beyond the Solomani Sphere were
1)seeded, not evolved, and 2)resurected from twice collapsed
interstelar civilizations, I would argue that the solomani would be
the only humanoid race that you might want to apply this to.  In any
case, I\'d be apt to limit the effect to a residual, considering the
time that has passed getting to the current milieu.  It might be great
fun as a topic for sociological and archelogical inquiry/research
during the early 1100\'s imperial, though!  Imagine the cultural
tension you could add to a campaign if characters started stereotyping
and slurring each other when the heat gets poured on =:-o

At one point in the dim and distant past, I had a history or timeline

The British had found this out three days after Pearl Harbour. Both HMS
Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales were sunk by Japanese Bombers and Torpedo
Planes. As HMS Prince of Wales was a new battleship with state-of-the-art
anti-aircraft weaponry it should\'ve been pretty obvious at that point.

He\'s generally held to be a bad King because he spent only 6 months of his
reign in his kingdom (England). What a lot of people forget, though is that
England was peaceful and well organized, unlike his french posessions,
which were fragmented, rebellious and often under attack by the King of
France. Thus he would\'ve been foolish to spend more time in England.
However there\'s little doubt that his decision to go on crusade was not
very bright, and staying with it after hir rivals had gone home was dumb.

I\'d suggest that being a good son to Henry II was not an easy task, and
none of his sons (aside perhaps from Henry) succeeded. He was also a good
enough son to be made heir rather than John (inheritance wasn\'t strictly by
birth order at that point). IMO Richard was a good son to mother, Elanor of
Aquitaine (he would have done better if he\'d been a worse one).

Sorry, it\'s just that this common view of Richard I bugs me.

Ummm... 1 square km is 1,000,000 square metres, so 4.07E19 m^2 becomes
4.07E16 km^2. Also the hexes are 30,000 km across, and so have and area of
about 5.846E8 km^2. This still gives an area of about 70,000 hexes.

OK, maybe traveller is unrealistic, but in the rules it only takes the 1/2

It\'s more like 70,000/3200 = 22 still more than at first calculated, but
not excessive. You don\'t need to search the whole volume constantly as once
you know there\'s nothing bad in it all you need to do is keep a good watch
on the perimeter. However, IMO, this is moot as I doubt that the pirate can
match with the prize and take anything worthwhile before the law arrives,
let alone get away.

My take is this:  A pirate group will *always* have ears to the ground for 
information on future shipping.  A lot of them will be tied into the insurance 
network.  The hottest setup would be for the group to be in collusion with 
free traders for insurance scams.

For instance, Free Trader \'Rabid Wombat\' is a couple months behind on its 
payments.  The stereotypical sleazy guy comes up to the captain and offers him 
a deal.  The captain buys some cheap easy to sell cargo on spec and insures it 
like it was worth a fortune.  \'Rabid Wombat\' lifts out and gets met near the 
80 diameter point where a \'pirate ship\' does a token attack causing cosmetic 
damage.  The \'Wombat\' immediately surrenders, is boarded and stripped.  More 
cosmetic damage is done and its jump drive is disabled.  The \'pirates\' head 
for the 100 diameter limit and jump to \'Wombat\'s next stop and sell the cargo. 
 \'Wombat\' returns insystem to file the insurance claim.  Everybody is fat & 
happy.

Doesn\'t matter. No matter what, would you trust the daughter of a trator with 
that much power, or assuming Isis ratted on Dulinor would you trust someone 
with so little honour?

I have no doubt that Strephon\'s presence was required elsewhere. What I see 
as Strephons failures are:

1 - He failed to prepare Lucan (3rd in line) for the throne. This was an 
unforgivable error. Lucan was most definitely not too far from the throne to be 
ignored. If Strephon and Iphegina had died (unlikely, but a definite possiblity) he 
becomes 1st in line; or if Varian dies he becomes 2nd in line. There are no 
excuses for this failure of judgement.

2 - When he absented himself from Capital he failed to make adequate 
preperations for a crisis. As far as we know he did not inform anybody of his 
absence. Assuming he informed Iolanthe and Iphegina, that was not sufficent. 
Both of them were regulary in the same place. At the very least several well 
trusted members of the moot should have been in the know (including 
Archduke Tranian). They obviously weren\'t because Tranian supported Lucan\'s 
claim to the throne. His failure was not leaving Capital, but in not telling people 
he was going.

3 - When the crisis blew up he failed to act swiftly and decisivly to restore 
order. Strephon was just 6 jumps from Capital. He had the authorisation codes 
to confirm his identity (if not refer to point 2). He should have transmitted them 
immediately to all fleet commanders, doing so would not have compromised 
Longbow but it would have prevented the disintergration of the Imperium. He 
must have known what Lucan\'s personality was like. The crisis came and he 
hesitated. If he acted decisively and quickly he could have stopped the war. It 
would have in all likelyhood cost him and his family the throne, but it would 
have saved the Imperium.

I see Strephon as a rather mediocre ruler. Honourable and noble, yes. Capable 
under normal cirumstances, yes. But he failed to see or prevent the potential 
(however remote) for a tragic disaster in his actions. And when the crisis came 
he hesitated and "kicked for touch" by running to Usdiki. Even then he failed to 
act (he must have had the codes to prove he was Strephon, even in 1117 
transmitting them could have stopped the rebellion).

What I think has happened is that Strephon has suddenly realised just how 
close to disaster thinggs came. He has realised just what could have 
happened, and has acted to rectify the situation. I\'d expect that better 
preperations have been made for any future absences.Varian and Lucan have 
been seperated and moved away from the throne; and I would not be surprised 
if they get a crash course in discipline and responsibility very soon ("Prince 
Lucan, congratulations your application to the Imperial Marine acadamy has 
been accepted"). And more importantly Dulinor\'s very real complaints might get 
addressed.

I\'d considered a "chop shop" as a way of disposing of starships. I think

A couple of points.  This is only radiation likely tp penetrate starship
hull.  and represents about 5% of the total radiation emitted by a nuclear
weapon in space.  Radiation protection is rouhly depended on density
(almost exclusively for  gamma rays) and and even that level of protection
offers considerably less protection against  neutron radiation (though
abouyt a foot of \'heavy\' (i.e. wet) comcrete reduces bt about 1/10.  This
rules are based roughly around real protection levels, You need abot 10 cm
of steel for a reduction to !/10  from Gamma rays,   a material twice as
dense requires half the thickness *but weighs the same).   Yiou can use
sophisticated boraonated plastics and others which will help against.  One
problem is ionisation of particles struck by neutrons and gamma rays (not
considered)That TL 10 battle suit is probably a great \'game\' solution to an
intractable proble.  If you multiply the values given by 15 you get the
radiation absorbed per square meter in joules.  This will probably cause
significant heating on traditiuonal suits.  (that other 95% soft x-rays).
I ignored all that radiation when calculating thes evalues.    I suggest
that gurps might just be using atmosphere radiiation effects rather than
space.  This would  give those sorts of errors.  If you wnt more detail let
me know.

Okay. A purpose-built corsair. So Imperial ports and patrolled areas are
right out.

Hmm. This is an interesting configuration. I know that according to the
rules (well, MT rules, anyway) this is possible, but I am curious as the the
geometry of your ship that can hold a type-S scout or seeker. Or a 95-ton
shuttle, for that matter. That\'s a long, pointy vehicle bay (with, I
suppose, a door sufficiently sized for one of these vehicles). I\'m
nitpicking, though.

Or makes it impossible for you to take anything, depending whether or not
precipitation out of jumpspace is random along the 100-diameter limit, how
long it takes to match vectors (on average) and so on. Of course, these are
an important IYTU tweaks.

I suspect this is because it would drive home to the players the
uncomfortable realization that their "noble adventurers" are really just
racist, heavily-armed burglars and killers.  :/

Most of the races the PC\'s are being racist against think of humans

don\'t shed too many tears for the plight of orcs and ogres. Still, the
bloodthirsty hack-n-slasher can get a bit tiresome after a while.

Kaznak\'s Kobolds were my answer to these guys. Kaznak\'s mob of
little blue gits scurried away when the PC\'s passed through their area
near the entrance of the dungeon. The PC\'s went down into the
dangerous deeps to perform heroic deeds, while the kobolds busied
themselved laying traps and ambushes for the party\'s return.

The PC\'s really should have suspected something when they started
up the stairs and noticed the pile of barrels stacked at the top. I guess
they were a little too tired from all the monster-hacking and treasure
hauling they\'d been doing.

You really have to see the look on a 10th level fighter\'s face when he
gets killed by a bunch of kobolds that never came within twenty feet
of him. :)

You\'re right, though: there are probably all manner of scams that can be
pulled off to illegally aquire credits. I wouldn\'t call it piracy, though
(it\'s just fraud).

I interpreted the gunner-16 in the Navy Enlisted template as being an
exceptional (PC-quality) individual (it\'s 90 points, after all); but
I confess my GURPS ignorance. We\'ll take 14 as average
civilian and 15 for navy. We then get

Civilian vs 400-ton target: 7 hexes 5-
                            2 hexes 7-
(not quite as plinky...)
Military vs 800-ton target: 7 hexes 11-

Civilian point defence: 12-  (Missiles have only a ~20% chance of 
                              getting through a few lasers.)
Military Point Defence: 17-  (Military ships are effectively immune to
                              impact missiles (as they should be); 
                              military missiles should be self-guiding 
                              and/or det-laser types.) 

I still can\'t tell how many missiles the two gunners in a bay can
control - two (one per gunner), fifty (one per communicator), or
one hundred (one per communicator per gunner, which the text could
be taken to imply?) I suppose the answer is 50, but that seems weird.
(And implies that a standard missile rack should add an extra laser
comm or two.)

Arghhhh. I have seen this argument so often and it annoys me every time. Their 
is no evidence that the Bismark was scuttled. And even if it was all that ment 
was her sinking was hastened.

The evidence is fairly conclusive and it supprises me every time I see this 
claim. Within half an hour of the engagement (09.15) the Bismark was lying low 
in the water and steaming at 5 knots.

To quote from the official Admiralty report:
"By 10 am the Bismark was a silent battered wreck, her mast was down, her 
funnel had disappeared, her guns were pointing in all directions, and a cloud of 
black smoke was rising from the middle of the ship and blowing away in the 
wind. Inside she was clearly a blazing inferno, for the bright glow of internal fires 
could be seen shining through numerous shell and splinter holes in her sides. 
Her men were deserting their guns, and parties of them could be seen running 
to and fro on the upper deck as shells continued to rain in, and occasionally 
jumping over the side to escape by a watery death from the terror on board. 
Captain Patterson (HMS Rodney) would have ceased fire earlier if he had 
known of this, but her port side was so screened by a wall of shell splashes 
along her whole length that it was none too easy to notice what was happening 
on board her."

Post war tests on the 12.6 inch armoured plates of the Tirpitz clearely showed 
that the 16 inch and 14 inch shells would have easily penetrated at the ranges 
the engagement was fought (which were sufficently short to make deck 
penetration unlikely). Before Tovey broke of the gun battle, Rodney was firing at 
a range of 4000 yards. As to scuttling, of the 115 survivors, all were from 
topside positions (no stokers or artificers amongst them) none could confirm if 
any such order had been given; if she had been scuttled, you would have 
expected some survivors from below decks.

Perhaps the best comment on the matter is:
"She (Bismark) fought an extremely couragous battle against greatly superior 
forces; in the best traditions of the old Imperial German Navy; she went down 
with her colours flying"
(Adm Sir John Tovey, C in C Home Fleet 1941)

HG rules say 1 bay for every 1000 tons displacement, and it takes the place of 
10 hardpoints.  So, if your boat is only 1000 dt, your bay weapon means you 
have no hardpoints.  This rule works for me.  A 100 ton bay has 100 missiles 
in its barrage, a 50 tonner, 50.  Definitely a serious wakeup call.  <grin>  
And under HG rules, you could *still* stuff 3 missile racks into a triple 
turret, not just 2.  Prob is, under those rules, you can\'t have a missile bay 
if you use missile turrets, which makes sense to me.  Personally, on, say, a 
5000 dt frigate, I\'d use a pair of 100 ton missile bays as a standoff weapon, 
10 triple laser turrets for point defense, and 20 dual energy weap turrets for 
close-in work.

The D&D campaign I have been playing in for about 10 years, one of our
players has successfully played Rusty and Dusty Kobold.  They are brothers
(players who take kobolds get  two).  There have been plenty of NPC
adventurers who rued the day they tangled with those two.  Rusty was very
handy with fireballs and made folks think twice about messing with him.
hehe
The little guys make great suprises.

Virus doesn\'t dance on the head of a pin, it engraves its microcode onto it so

Okay. A purpose-built corsair. So Imperial ports and patrolled areas are
right out.

Another bit about the _Nishemani_ (and, most probably, other
corsair craft) - it doesn\'t always seem to be the same craft,
especially at a distance, so it might even be able to spend some
time being watched by the good guys, as long as it didn\'t get
too close.

Variable emissions arrays. A variable transponder. Even external
modules that can be deployed as fake fins and such (it only has to
fool a radar). Maybe enough to make the locals think the ship is
a harmless Fat Trader or legit Impie Patrol Cruiser, just for a critical
few hours or so.

Hmm. This is an interesting configuration. I know that according to the
rules (well, MT rules, anyway) this is possible, but I am curious as the the
geometry of your ship that can hold a type-S scout or seeker. Or a 95-ton
shuttle, for that matter. That\'s a long, pointy vehicle bay (with, I
suppose, a door sufficiently sized for one of these vehicles). I\'m
nitpicking, though.

Still working on it. I\'d like to come out with a deck plan for this baby,
but the design of the bay is hard to match up with my esthethic

Aye, but that last is the catch, isn\'t it?

If YTU has an Imperium with a (relatively) infallible ability to detect,
identify and track every ship at every location in every system, then
you\'ll have no pirates. If YTU has no ships worth anything straying
away from patrolled space, or a patrol cruiser stationed within easy
interception range of every belter\'s workshack and lumbering supply
shuttle, then you\'ll have no pirates.

You\'ll also have no point to involving the PC\'s in space travel. You may
as well play Traveller like the first release of _Star Frontiers_, where
space ships weren\'t considered at all - just drop your PC\'s at the gate
of a different star port every week, space was too boring to spend any
game time on.

IMO, the dangers of space travel in adventure sci-fi are more interesting
when some of them include a human element as an adversary.
I like at least the option of pirates being an available opponent.
Thus my tweakings and analyses.

Thanks for the comments.

Its in GURPS Compendium I.  The book has a lot of advantages,
disads, etc.

If you don\'t want to get it, just replace that advantage with
another one.

Geez, all my kobolds needed were some rubbish piles, some barrels,

  As the original poster pointed out, these are some of the redeeming
characteristics that make using an Imperial port, or getting stopped
by a patrol craft, _totally *bleeping* suicidal_. Unless of course
they\'re not detectable by detailed physical inspection.

    'body' => 'My brother at Fort Bragg tells me of a piece of gear the US Army is
doing some test deployments of now, it\'s called Shortstop.

Shortstop is a backpack-sized box of electrical stuff, about the size
of a WW2 field radio. It puts out radio waves of a kind that might
have it\'s designer mobbed by Army grunts intending to buy him
drinks, offer him their women, etc.

What does it do? It makes proximity-fused munitions - artillery shells,
mortar shells, some kinds of air-dropped munitions, etc. - explode a 
little differently.

I\'m sure most readers are familiar with prox-fused rounds. If you toss
an explosive round an some infantry and it smacks into the ground,
it pretty much only kills the guy it landed on and makes a hole for
his buddies to hide in. Put a proximity fuse on the round, it gets to
explode just _before_ it hits the ground - killing lots more people as
it sprays them liberally with blast and shrapnel from above.

Now enter Shortstop. It emits radio waves that confuse these proximity
fuses, so they think they\'re close to the ground and explode.

While they\'re still 500 meters away.

You can make a shell that ignores Shortstop. It\'ll cost you about
US$1000 each, instead of about US$25 to $50 each, so you won\'t
have as many to shoot.

Everything I\'ve heard about the armed forces tells me that, of all the
things to get attacked with, infantry hates artillery the most. The way
it comes from out of nowhere to kill you, the way you can\'t do anything
but hunker down and hope they run out of ammo. I\'m imagining these
grunts, if Shortstop works, fighting for the priviledge of wearing it
(and thus being in the middle of the protection zone).

  While not quite the same thing, there was apparently a quite extensive
strain of piracy that amounted to business ventures run from ports outside

I can Psi-Cops like Al Bester from B5...  They police the Psis...

Great plot device...  A PC Psi has been using his gifts for his own gain &
a Psi Cop is sent out after him...  Or, the Psis decide to take over the 4I
& use their gifts to make the difference, i.e. a teleporter can tie up huge
amounts of troops, a clairvoyant can see where troops are, a
telekinetic<sp> can operate many weapons at once, a telepath knows what you
are thinking, & someone with Awareness can increase his strength for short
periods of time...  In other words how can you stop them?

 Has anyone used similar races/teams in their Imperial Traveller games? I\'ve
suffered bouts of midget gangsters and little green men from Mars (ever see
"Spaced Invaders"?), and of course Raccoonids are rather common (since I game
with their creators). I\'m also quite guilty of inflicting "an indeterminate
number of Droyne" on groups in the past...
 Anyone else?

  As the original poster pointed out, these are some of the redeeming
characteristics that make using an Imperial port, or getting stopped
by a patrol craft, _totally *bleeping* suicidal_. Unless of course
they\'re not detectable by detailed physical inspection.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Of course you\'re not _using_ the ports, or getting close to patrol
craft. Agreed, suicidal. You might, however, still be able to *hunt*
near such areas, *if you can look harmless for a long enough
period of time*. That\'s what these features are for - to let you look
like normal traffic until you find a target.

Jump in-system, to a system that hasn\'t enough patrol craft to
stop everyone immediately. Emit and transpond like an innocent
Fat Trader, with an ID code that looks right but will eventually
(days/weeks later) twig suspicious, if anyone decides to look carefully
at the records. Point your ship towards some outer system
destination, or into normal traffic, whatever vectors you nearer other
ships and farther from patrol ships. Check vectors carefully, ready
for a strike & grab on a ship you can match with, or ready to rabbit
when your turn on the board & search queue gets close.

You\'ve sweated an hour inside a patrol ship\'s interception envelope.
He\'s turned to match with a Free Trader, his projected area where he
can still catch you slowly drags away. Your Navigator works
feverishly, ID\'ing the abilities of other ships in traffic, carefully
plotting who you can catch, and who you\'ll have time to raid
before you and your prize drift back into the interception range of
that overworked patrol ship out there.

There it is...a Fat Trader, kind of new looking, vectoring into the
ecliptic traffic pattern on a laborious parabola after a minor 
realspace jump error. The Navigator lays the plot...we can intercept
her, and might - if we can disable her or get her to surrender - have
ninety minutes to get clear before the nearest patrol cruiser can
intercept.

The Pirate Captain gives the order. Precious minutes are wasted by
the authorities, as  junior patrol crewman on boring sensor watch tries 
to figure out if his equipment is malfunctioning. Where did that Trader 
go? There it is...pulling how many G\'s? Call the Captain, alert! But
we\'re hard aside a merchantman, with a third of our crew not
aboard...the nearest backup is where?!? More time lost...he\'s
a patrol captain, not a front-line Imperial Navy warship commander.

The hapless Fat Trader is easy pickings. A string of rescue balls,
their emergency beacons a plaintive wail in the darkness, streams
off on one vector as the Corsair takes another. The patrol captain
makes a hard choice - chase a pirate, or ensure the safety of the
drifting crew? The Fat Trader drifts silent, her lifeboat missing, her
lockers and safe stripped...the passengers and crew safe aboard,
the hazardous rescue balls merely a diversion, this time.

Records will add the mysterious trader to the attack and seize list,
but that radar profile and transponder signature will never be seen
again. Perhaps a taunt over the radio from the fleeing pirate before
his ship sought sanctuary in jump space, nothing more will be
known...until the pirate makes a mistake.

    'body' => 'Yes, piracy exists IMTU. Quick, somebody add some IMTU codes for Piracy.
BTW, who\'s maintaining the IMTU Codes sheet?

Anyway, any corsair design which is going to survive is going to look like
a fairly typical hull of some other class(es). For example, typical hulls
would be 400td cyl AF (like the subbie), 400td needle AF (like the PC),
200td hulls to match the various type "A" traders, etc. Most should be
built with multiple power plants: one PP to match "Target Profile", and the
other to beef up for combat mode. (Yes, this requires FF&S, or bending MT
to allow multiples on-line at once. Which, btw, Hard times seems to allow.)

As for parting out ships, many parts will be resaleable to others at low
control ports, "Starmerc Moots", pirate hangouts, etc, and probably without
too many middlemen. I read somewhere that turret installations only take
about 2 or three hours, assuming the socket is present, and the software is
ready. If the socket is a standardized unit, a competant engineer should be
able to rip it out pronto.

Basically, even with cautious assumptions of revenue capability, the key to
piracy inthe late 3rd imp isn\'t technology.... it is whether or not the
Imperial Gov\'t gets enough outcry in a given area to actually put a stop to
it. This crucial threshold seems to be the key hangup in the discussions
(I\'ll skip names). If the threshold is particularly low, the 3i will be
spending most of it\'s naval budgets to patrol; if it\'s too high, the 3I
will only know of wars when the invaders start unloading at the downports.

Canon says there are pirates, and that they exist throughout the spinward
marches (TTA). The CGen provides for "Letter of Marque" as a benefit for
Pirates (sup4, MTPH). The rules of war do not prohibit space-naval actions
between imperial member worlds (TTA, Sup 8, MTIE, Striker). TCS doesn\'t
(directly) address Imperial conditions.

 The encounter tables provide a fairly low (but everpresent) chance of
pirate encounters in systems, with 1/36 significant encounters being with a
ship minded towards piracy of some flavor (MTIE). Under MT, (and IIRC,
under CT) you roll for ship category, then type, then mission, then
disposition. Disposition rolls of 2-5 (Hasty departure or leaving) would
tend to indicate that the ship either is not interested in you, or is going
elsewhere. At least the hasty departure (2-3) would indicate not enoguh
time to take you on... so that\'s redcuing hostility chances to 33/36 of
1/36 or less (11/432) chance of a viable pirate encounter, before applying
the commonsense approach of making a reaction roll! Sounds about like the
chances of being carjacked while driving in a bad neighborhood. Also note
that the encounters are significant encounters (MT makes clear in the rules
on encounters (MTRM) that all encounters rolled are significant encounters,
not the sum total of items you happen to be elligible to encounter. In
short, space encounters are things that catch your eye, not just every ship
in space.

As for pirates vs starmercs: if the imperium leaves anti-piracy (except
large scale operations like the kforzueng) work to local and private
concerns, starmercs will exist in areas where piracy, privateering, etc is
occuring. If starmercs can be built. most of them make excellent pirates,
too.

Since tradewar is cannon, there\'s likely to be work for starmercs in areas
where  there is a tradewar brewing (nobody wants to be unguarded during a
hostile action, even if they are not a valid target). If the economic costs
of piracy are borne by ship-owners (rather than governments or powerful
insurance corporations), neither the government nor the corporations are
going to consider  the occasional loss of a cargo or 2 a year per system
too terribly bad, so long as the taxes get paid. Only when it becomes
CHEAPER to hunt and capture/kill/erradicate the pirates than to ignore them
will a government do something about it. Only if insurance companies can
effectively lobby can they do something about piracy, lest they charter
their own starmercs, and/or engage in tradewar against their rival\'s
clients (ala some of the 1930\'s gangwars protection rackets gone bad).

If you want something really annoying, look at the hijacking rules... 1/216
chance of a hijacking attempt if there are ANY NPC\'s aboard...

Oh, one other side thought... could some of those "pirate" encounters be
ships just hijacked??? <EFG>

Actually, due to the rudder damage, Bismarck\'s best speed was about
five knots anyway.

Everything you quoted (hardly an unbiased source, BTW) did not rule
out Bismarck being scuttled. Close range gunfire from KGV and Rodney
did indeed penetrate the armor belt, but above the waterline. I
believe the senior surviving officer of the Bismarck recounted that
the scuttling order had indeed been given (again, not quite an
unbiased source) as well.

Above the water line, which might explain why hardly anyone from below
decks escaped. The routes to the upper decks were blocked with fire
and debris.

That\'s if the radiation is absorbed.  Perhaps they have a way of reflecting

This is very cool stuff. Comments inserted individually.

Step zero ... fill your cargo bay with a collapsible fuel bladder. If you
dont need it, vent it, and use the cargo space for loot as and when
neccessary. It will give you the opportunity to refuel a prize for a
jump-1, if you do in fact hit an advantageous tactical opportunity (such as
a sensor operator who has been stunned by a large amount of cash).

I\'m not so sure of this. In this case, the crew may be on the wrong side of
a dilemna - if they allow the ship to be captured, even after a \'fair
fight\', then the pirates could say \'Golly good show, chaps\' and steal the
ship and leave them in a life boat, or survival capsules, or whatever.

If they cripple their own ship, then murder is an option, in order to
encourage the others.

If you have another state anywhere nearby (say, within a sector) that is
prepared to buy captured ships, then I think it would be worth taking the
\'long road\' to it, and selling it there. Two years travel time still leaves
a fair chunk of change in selling a Far Trader in the Vargr Extents.

I think this may be higher, if you are selling to belters. But 50% retail

0.1% really isnt that much money. You can run up double that with one good

I\'d actually double this - people are going to have cash etc to spend at

well.

Lots of ways around this - the easiest is to weld cargo crates to the hold.

Fair enough, if maintainence is being discounted. I\'d assume some level of
combat damages, and of course bribes are deductible for pirates. I\'d call
it MCr 5 all up.

Pirating small craft in the outsystem therefore seems to be an optimal
strategy. Add some raiding of belter colonies, and we have a nice

If this is true, cargo haulers will be able to ask for more to ship goods
to unpatrolled systems, and will thus be able to afford to be more heavily
armed. Freight rates should get a risk premium ...

They are pretty decent. You might want to check Appendix A of Andrew\'s

privateering could be.

I don\'t see any reason why groups can\'t pool points for ships and vehicle.
Twilight:2000 used the system and it worked quite well as far as I remember.

I received mine yesterday in Sweden. They were sent on 12th and 14th so took
about a week to reach me, which I thought was pretty good.
I had time for a quick read of GT and agree with a lot of the comments made so
far; very nicely presented, hex grid deck plans look weird to start with, ship
design seems nice and simple for an intro system.
One bit I especially liked was in chargen. The template format is a nice one.
Every career gets a number of mandatory skills with some points left over for
tweaking. Makes more sense to me.
Don\'t know if  I\'m too keen on the ads, disads or quirks though. I\'d probably
put together a list of ref approved ones (for starships, contacts etc.) before
running a game with new characters.

Is the bank liable to make a loan on any ship design?  When the bank
sees the design for a 4 g, jump 3 big cargo hold, no high or middle
passenger design ship aren\'t they going to wonder what you will use it
for?

If you tell them the ship will be used for mercenary operations won\'t
the high risk use of the ship make them need to charge you a higher
intrest rate?

It occured to me that ships with a higher jump number will find it
easier to skip out on their loans because they may be able to outrun the
news more easily.  In addition ships with higher jump numbers will have
less space left for cargo anyway & thus will have a greater risk of not
making money.

What if getting a bank loan was a task and the jump number of the ship
was a negative DM to the task.  Thus it would be harder to get a loan
for a less commercially viable, easier to skip on, ship.  Marginal
success on this task could mean the loan was at a premium intrest rate,
required a higher % down, or both.

The reality of the loan industry is that if the banks don\'t think you
can pay them back or that if & when you don\'t pay thay can seize your
collateral (the ship) & sell it to pay off the loan they _will_not_ make
that loan.

So how much time will this take?  IE how long does it take to qualify
for a starship morgage bank loan in Traveller?  (Obviously this will
vary depending on which bank you use.)

This gets back to the classic question of how much information about
people is readily available.  The more information the bank has about
you the more rapidly they can make their decision.  If the bank had to
do an Imperium wide data search on you to check for previous
convicitions it might cost several Megacredits  (or more) and take
several years to get back information from all the planetary governments
in the Imperium and of course given 11,000 planets there will be
thousands that don\'t bother to respond to the bank and hundreds that
don\'t keep records or keep their records a secret.  How can the bank
decide to take the risk?

On the other hand it is easily possible (and probably makes for a more
playable universe) if the banks _do_not_ check that extensively.  After
all if the morgage loan intrest rates include an appropriate risk
premium and/or the loan ammount includes the cost of barratry insurance
the bank won\'t care too much.  Then they will not need to make as
extensive a background check on loan applicants.

Any sort of traffic control is going to make this very difficult.

Allocating \'parking orbits\' while waiting for customs clearance or traffic
control allocating courses is going to make things hard for our pirate.

OK, so we have a number of ships in the system greater than n, but small
enough that you dont have to go halfway across the system with a patrol
ship on your tail.

We also have a tax base small enough to support one active patrol boat
(there might be a couple in the shop).

Are both these conditions credible ? Would a class D or E system (from the
sounds of it, that seems to be about what you are describing) have this
level of traffic ?

Quick note ... 90 minutes is probably long enough to transfer fuel from
your collapsible bladder into the Trader.

It is also a neat bit of sensor work to detect if it\'s new or not from
sensor readings at the sort of ranges I think you\'re talking about. About
size, power plant output and current gees is about it, I think. Still,
enough to create a target profile.

At this point, the pirate may get a nasty surprise if the Fat Trader is
more heavily armed than expected. This is a definitly substantial, possibly
fatal, risk.

The patrol cruiser may also be able to engage in long-range nuisance fire,
especially with x-ray lasers. But this depends on combat vs sensor ranges.

This is no choice, to me at least. The crew are absolutely safe in the
rescue balls. I mean, if you cant survive in one for time for help to
arrive, what use are rescue balls ?

A quick sensor scan may also pick up if the balls are radiating heat ... a
third-line sensor ship may not think of this, however.

Depending on how common Cargo Riders are, one of those designs could be an

Well, it\'s not *neccessarily* only the IN that has the resources. Planets
with vaguely reasonable amounts of trade (and thus traffic) certainly have
enough resources to secure their systems against reasonable sized pirate
groups. Banks may also be interested, and insurers and re-insurers would
certainly be interested in reducing claims.

I\'d say that if piracy is at all common, there would be a lot of work for
starmercs.

Well, given the fact that insurance companies will have substantial amounts
of money, I\'d say they are in a decent position to lobby. Better than Free
Traders, anyway.

A corruptible Imperium also cuts both way - I am more than happy with the
idea of Regina Reinsurance slipping a quiet megacredit a month to the
Subsector Admiral to make sure an active anti-piracy profile is maintained.

Well, a little bit anyway; it still only gives Middle passages instead of

IMO; this not Pearl was
more illustrative of the vunerability of capital ships to air power.
Both
ships were steaming at flank speed, had plenty of searoom to
manuever, were at
general quarters, and had their AA guns manned; yet they still
couldn\'t defend
themselves....

I agree this seems like the end of battleships as "stand alone"
combat vessels.  However, nothing has yet shown they have no utility. 
Battleships have been used in all major US conflicts since and had
very good effect.  They make a powerful offensive core of a task
force, but have limited defence against air attacks (that\'s what the
escorts are for).
I would love to see a 1998 designed battleship.  I think the almost
60 years of advances in naval architecture could make a modern
battleship very impressive compared to WWII designs.

I was thinking more of small military ships - escorts, frigates,

On the other hand, it looks like I miscalculated hit probabilities, which
seem
(if I\'m reading it right) to be quite low...consider a civilian ship:
************
yes you are doing it correctly.


Firing at a 400-ton target (+9 size) at 7 hexes (-43) it hits only on a 3.
At 2 hexes it hits on a 5-. Civilian ships will have to plink away a long
time to hit anything...

In point defence mode, the military ship gets 44 - 39 (0 hex) + 10 (PD) for

through.)

These are not as high to-hit numbers as I initially thought they were
(unless
I\'m doing something wrong) - in fact, they seem too low; GURPS lasers must
not be very accurate :-)

But most often such items aren\'t transleted to german anymore, they\'re
taken directly like words from various technology areas. 

(Examples: You often hear the words Computer, Harddisk, Monitor, although
in German they\'re named Rechner, Festplatte, Bildschirm. Much words now

HG rules say 1 bay for every 1000 tons displacement, and it takes the place
of
10 hardpoints.  So, if your boat is only 1000 dt, your bay weapon means you
have no hardpoints.  This rule works for me.  A 100 ton bay has 100
missiles
in its barrage, a 50 tonner, 50.
************
well 100DT bay aren\'t available (yet) buy 50 missile can ruin your whole

 Definitely a serious wakeup call.  <grin>
And under HG rules, you could *still* stuff 3 missile racks into a triple
turret, not just 2.  Prob is, under those rules, you can\'t have a missile
bay
if you use missile turrets, which makes sense to me.
*************
out of cuitosity, why does this make sense to you?


  Personally, on, say, a
5000 dt frigate, I\'d use a pair of 100 ton missile bays as a standoff
weapon,
10 triple laser turrets for point defense, and 20 dual energy weap turrets
for
close-in work.

The Drak Ne\'Vha in GURPS Alien Races I operate an almost exclusive battle
rider force -- basically, they did not develop jump drive until contact
witht he Vargr, but had a large spacefaring non-starship navy at the time
(interplanetary conflicts). So rather than scrap the whole thing, they
simply built battle tenders. The different Drak Ne\'Vha clans use battle
riders for planetary defense; when operating as part of the central
government\'s military (Ash Lokbar) they load \'em onto battle tenders.
Basically, they are a starfaring "big SDB" force -- in fact, they even
build "escort tenders" that are designed to carry 2-4 SDB-sized riders.

0.1% really isnt that much money. You can run up double that with one good

Even with battle damage you\'ll get some benefits (that I have yet to

triple beam laser turret on board, you may actually come out ahead
of the game. Plunder can be a wonderful thing.

I\'d actually double this - people are going to have cash etc to spend at

This is one of the fuzzier assumptions in the list. I\'ll assume (especially

This kind of reasoning is why I didn\'t bother with the numbers for
a subsidized liner or any of the big trade ships from the Traveller
Adventure. They, IMO, won\'t be lonely often enough for a 400tn
Corsair to plan on hitting one. Could happen, as a surprise to
both parties..."What are _they_ doing here?!?"

A Fat Trader still under sub contract still has a chunk of the year
to trade where it will, and there are "Free Merchants" out there
(Fat Traders released from their subbie contracts). The profit numbers
for the Fat Trader are most strongly affected by the presence of the
launch/lifeboat - any ship that has one will make about as much
money. A Lab Ship (which may spend lots of time in poorly settled
areas) would net quite a bit more.

feudal, maybe even more so than the 3I, and has probably not met the

Aslan are common as mercs, with the merc companies being given fiefdoms

If anyone would like to join, please mail me personally, and I\'ll begin 
to set up a mailing list.  Also, if Marc reads this, or someone can give

A high Delta V will seriously hamper your ability to slow down once you
get near the area where you want to lurk. In space you do not stop just
because you stop accelerating. A high Delta V means you spent a long time
building up your speed and have to spend a lot of time decellerating.
Cold gas maneuvering thrusters? What is the cost, in both money and tonnage
of a cold gas thruster system?

>As for matching velocities, you can finish that after you disable him.

You miss my point. Matching velocities will take time and all the while
the merchant is bulleting towards safety and one or more patrol vessels
are speeding towards you. Also you are getting deeper and deeper into a
gravity well. Once you do chase down the merchant and plunder him, you
will have to make an \'outside 10-diameter\' jump.

So do patrol vessels.

Landing point? Surely the actual landing spot on the planet would not mean
more than a few minutes\' difference in arrival time. Especially since the
ship will arrive with a plus or minus of up to a day.

Since this is determined when the astrogator makes his astrogation plot, the

Chicken and egg argument. If pirates were so common as the encounter tables
make them, then arming a merchant ship makes sense. But if merchant ships
are aremed, pirates have yet another problem. So there can\'t be any pirates,
especially if there are armed merchant ships. So there is no need for armed
merchant ships.

But to answer your question: Maybe the ships are armed for the same reason

First of all, the 1000 ships per sector is for the regular fleet only. It
dosen\'t include subsector fleets (which recieves the same amount of funds
as the regular fleet, though they spend them differently) and it dosen\'t
include planetary navies. Most especially it does not not include auxiliaries.
Yet most auxiliaries would be quite capable of giving a pirate a hard time.

Yes, but I don\'t assume that, for two reasons: There is canonical evidence
against it and real world examples show that those figures are reasonable.

No I don\'t. I have accounted for planetary armies, because I have assigned
70% of the canonical 3% to planetary forces (No, I tell a small lie: I have
simplified matters by letting the Imperial cut be 1/3rd instead of 30%). I
have accounted for the subsector forces by allowing them half the Imperial
cut. I have allowed for logistics by paying 10% of the cost of the ships
pa. in maintenance. I have guestimated the number of auxiliaries in a
typical fleet (If you want to increase that number, go ahead. But keep in
mind that most auxiliaries are quite capable of handling a pirate). I
account for the Marines by assuming they are part of the ship complement. I
have... you know, I _have_ forgotten to account for the Imperial Army. I did
originally, but they must have gotten dropped accidentally at some point.
Not to worry. I have 66% of the Imperial armed forces budget unaccounted for
still, so I will assign the Army something out of that. How much do you think
would be reasonable? It\'s my impression that the Imperial Army is a
relatively small outfit (I said relatively! ;-). What about the 8%
canonically use on the Army by vacuum worlds? And I haven\'t accounted for the
Scouts either. What would be reasonable for them?

>These are all assumtions not canon.

Most of it is canon.

>The only canon we have is cross version. Is there enough canon in any one
>version of the TU to figure the budget for that version?

Yes. CT. Though I don\'t quite agree with your point, which seems to be that
the four Traveller versions constitute four distinct canons. My approach is
to accept anything official as canon provided it 1) makes sense and 2) does
not contradict any other canon. 

>I have CT and T4.  In T4 you lose military money if you spend it elsewhere.

You\'re referring to PE, aren\'t you? I must confess that I simply hhaven\'t
had the energy to try to integrate PE economics with earlier versions. 

>Maybe they are spending the money in \'infrastructure\'.

They are. Annual maintenance is 0.1% of ship\'s cost (1% of annual budget).
Salaries run to about 0.25% (2.5% of annual budget). 2.5% goes to building
replacements (that\'s an assumption on my part based on a 40 year life
cyclus for the ships. Since there is canonical evidence of ships lasting
for over a century that may be quite a bit too high). I presume the remaining
71.5% of the budget goes to "infrastructure".

I hope there is, but there don\'t _have_ to be. Sometimes a background just
contains a contradiction. I have canonical statements that the _Maghiz_
took place in -927, -925, AND -924. There is no simple answer to explain
that. Two of them are just plain wrong. But go ahead. I wish you luck.

That was addressed last time around (or was it the round before that?). 
Annual maintenance takes two weeks, not four. And most systems have a
Class A or B starport on a high-population world within one or two jumps.

I have ... I just haven\'t responded. I lurked reading the traveller digest

last year when GT was announced.

Sarcasm aside, I find the TML is actually one of the better RPG-related

One thing I\'ve noticed is that no one has really commented on the GT

So the banks file a claim, leaving the insurance companies to chase down
the lost ship/crew in manner of bail companies which use bailbondsmen.
Of course, the insurance companies have a different names for their
employees...bounty hunters.

Oooooh, I *like* this! Imagine PCs being hunted by a group of bounty
hunters funded by an insurance corp. which has assets derived from an
entire sector. Of course, smaller companies could also look to hire a
freelance team (as in PCs). Oh, yeah!

What about a shell that targets Shortstop?  Shoot that off first, and then

Also, if you are churning out millions of Shortstop-proof shells I suspect
that the cost will drop. 

Hm. Maybe an ECM/ECCM task roll, as a contested task, and using tech level

Charles, you read the text the way the Devil reads the Bible. The text say
"combat vessels SUCH AS cruisers, carriers, battleships, and some escorts".
For those escorts to be metioned in the same breath as cruisers, carriers,
and battleships it seems reasonable to assume that they would be in the
same general weight class as cruisers, carriers, and battleships. So I
conjectured that some cruiser-sized escorts existed and that it was those
that was meant. Ast it turns out, _Fighting Ships of the Shattered Imperium_
(which I don\'t have) makes it clear that such ships do exist, so no
conjecture is needed. those escorts are capital ships without a spinal
mount. The sloan Class is that kind of escort the same way the KINUNIR is
a cruiser. 

>It does not fit the numbers in the histories of the frontier and false wars.

Well, most of the histories deal with the movement of fleets, so I don\'t
see why it makes a difference whether it is 8 battleship fleets or 64
battleship fleets. It\'s true that the number of squadrons in FFW is far
too low, but FFW was a boardgame. My take on that is that the forces were
reduced proportionally to make for a playable game. But trot out your
evidence. Maybe I missed something somewhere.

>capital ships and 800 escorts or 250/700 if their are a lot of cruisers.

The one example I have (I guess I will have to get hold of FSSI after all)
has none of the escorts from the 1000 ship figure. It does have one
auxiliary type escort per capital ship. Which is what I gave my hypothetical
average fleet.

Those count against a different budget.

The KINUNIR is not a real cruiser. The AZHANTI had a "print run" of, what,
120? (My books are at home). Perhaps it was an atypical number. One example
just proves that it is within the parameters but it dosen\'t say where.

_Rebellion_ explains that the Imperium operates with two kinds of fleets.
Numbered fleets are (roughly) one regular and one subsector fleet to a
subsector (with a few extra for special cases; the Imperium have about 300
subsectors and 320 regular fleets). The other kind is the named fleet. A
named fleet is either a command structure for all the numbered fleets in
a sector of a separate force. The evidence is conflicting, but I have
chosen the first interpretation. In any case, there is a named fleet for
each sector and provision for creating special named fleets for special
occasions.

>I have seen \'sector fleet\' and \'subsector fleet\' both used.

\'Sector fleet\' would be the same as a named fleet. \'Subsector fleet\' is
ambiguous. It could be the regular fleet stationed in a subsector, but
it is more likely to be the local fleet (also known as the reserve fleet,
but that can be confused with the ships laid up in ordinary (if any).
I prefer \'regular\' and \'colonial\' fleet. That is unambiguous.

That\'s what the examples imply. 8 battle ships.

The example don\'t mention escorts. That dosen\'t mean they are not there.

That\'s right. But that dosen\'t mean the Navy can\'t have some scout ships of
it\'s own. Propably larger than Type Ss.

It dosen\'t make much difference either way. You need a LOT of 100 T ships to
make a dent in the Imperial naval budget.

That is supposed to be paid for out of the 10% maintenance cost.

Well, if you could prove that you would have a basis for challenging the 10%
figure.

The equipment AND the personnel to service a ship will cost roughly what it
costs to maintain 25 ships of that size. Which is what the 0.1% maintenance
fee goes to.

Unfortunately a huge reserve fleet gives other problems for the background.

It specifically states that: Military spending ranges from 1% (after a long
time of peace) to 15% (during a war) with 3% being the average for the
Imperium. It further states that the Imperium gets 30% of that and that
the Imperium uses half of that for its regular forces and half for its
colonial forces. It does not say how big a percentage the Imperium uses
for the Imperial Army, but it does say that individual planets use between
6% to 40% of their budgets on their suborbital forces. The low figure is for
planets without a breathable atmosphere.

David Pulver posted some figures just the other day. IIRC it was 1.4% for

Odd...that disagrees somewhat with the mass combat system, where skill 12 is
average troop level, 13 is experienced, 14 is veteran, 15 is elite.  Of course,
you really should add 1 to all those levels for gunner skills, for IQ bonuses
(assuming 10-11 is typical).

Well, I suspect that the penalty for multiple point defense attacks is per
gunner, not per weapon system, which means you\'re really dealing with 10
turrets on point defense, not 30 individual lasers.

Heh.  Dedicated military vehicles built with GVE2 can probably kill 5-10x their
weight in vehicles designed with the GT system, though they\'ll cost 2-3x as
much at the same size.  I was playing around with a 10T TL 12 fighter design..
11 Gs, DR 2000 (4000 from one facing), 12,000 hp, 11 Gs, 1 laser/1 missile,
radical stealth/ems, electronics significantly exceeding the standard cockpit
bridge, etc.... slightly over 20 MCr.  Somehow, I think that can kill Ramparts
at 2:1 odds ;)

Traveller laser weapons (post FFS1) have a handwave called grav focusing

<< What happens if rather than using HG one uses a vector movement system and

 if the Tigeress in the meantime blew away the tender (and some of the BRs,

 BTW has anyone ever tried a battle between a BR equipped BatRon and a BB
 BatRon, complete with all escorts, etc? It\'d be interesting to see the
 results, especially from a vector based system like Battle Rider (with
 fixes, of course). You see, it occured to me that the BR \'Ron would have to
 tie up escorts looking after the tender, while the BB \'Ron could use them
 more aggressively. >>

This depends on an assumption that I have always made; ie. the squadron jumps
in and the tender dumps off her riders and HIDES till the shooting is over.
Outer system space is a large area to hide in. Thus I wouldn\'t have the tender
in the scenario (I use Mayday/HG so I have vector movement). I found (in a
scenario with 16x25000ton BR\'s versis a Tigress that the Tigress gets pounded.
16 type T Meson guns just gets too many criticals. The vector movement helps
the \'riders even more, as they tend to have agility 6 (mine do), and can zip
around the map like fat frying on a hot plate. If the tender is in the
scenario (to represent the unlikely event of the squadron jumping insystem
next to the defending BatRon, then the tender just runs like hell. A million
ton tender can absorb a LOT of criticals, and this means that the SDBs are not
being shot at. This arguement does not mean that Battleships are inferior to
rider-tender combos. They have different roles. The tender-ron is more cost
effiecient, but as has been said a zillion times before; the tender-ron is a
concentrated force multiplier (my tender-ron - 16x25000riders and a jump4
million ton tender), and thus can\'t be mission tailored; ie. it\'s the whole
squadron or nothing. A squadron of Battleships can be broken up. Lastly, as
has also been pointed out already, is the vunerability of riders to being
marooned or overwhelmed when their tender is destroyed. A remedy to this is to
install as many defenses as possible on the tender. The downside is that this
makes the tender large and expensive (I didn\'t make my tender so big for the
heck of it). Thus the utility of Battleships contrasts nicely with the cost
effectiveness of \'riders. This probably explains the Imperium\'s decision to
procure both.... I just find it\'s more fun to design and fight \'riders...:-)

A neat idea - I guess it\'s working on things that have a radar-type

barometric fuse remotely.

Yes and no. Sure, airburst is probably your fuse of choice against
troops in the open. Fire a time-on-target strike, and relocate your
artillery. But against prepared infantry, you want a delayed action fuse
- - to allow the shell to get right down in the bunker/trench with them,
rather than just spreading shrapnel onto their overhead cover.

Find out who is directing the fall of said artillery, and remind them
why it\'s considered impolite.

Yep, the Davy Crocket - a nuclear mortar, IIRC - was a bad piece of
work. Most commadanders were reportedly too scared to fire it with a HE
shell, the thing was so inaccurate.

The US Navy version of this was the ASTOR (nicknamed the ASTOR-
Disaster). ASTOR (Anti-Submarine TORpedo) was a 533mm torp with a
nuclear warhead - and a p(K) of 2.0. It would get the target, and the
firing vessel.

ObTraveller: Any similar bonehead designs in the far future? How about
an early FGMP.

Aside: No hand grenades can be thrown further than their danger radius.
They are designed to be used where terrain or buildings block the
shrapnel in the direction of the thrower. Failing that, lying down helps
a bit.

<< My brother at Fort Bragg tells me of a piece of gear the US Army is
 doing some test deployments of now, it\'s called Shortstop.
 
 Shortstop is a backpack-sized box of electrical stuff, about the size
 of a WW2 field radio. It puts out radio waves of a kind that might
 have it\'s designer mobbed by Army grunts intending to buy him
 drinks, offer him their women, etc.
 
 What does it do? It makes proximity-fused munitions - artillery shells,
 mortar shells, some kinds of air-dropped munitions, etc. - explode a 
 little differently.
 
 I\'m sure most readers are familiar with prox-fused rounds. If you toss
 an explosive round an some infantry and it smacks into the ground,
 it pretty much only kills the guy it landed on and makes a hole for
 his buddies to hide in. Put a proximity fuse on the round, it gets to
 explode just _before_ it hits the ground - killing lots more people as
 it sprays them liberally with blast and shrapnel from above.
 
 Now enter Shortstop. It emits radio waves that confuse these proximity
 fuses, so they think they\'re close to the ground and explode.
 
 While they\'re still 500 meters away.
 
 You can make a shell that ignores Shortstop. It\'ll cost you about
 US$1000 each, instead of about US$25 to $50 each, so you won\'t
 have as many to shoot.
 
 Everything I\'ve heard about the armed forces tells me that, of all the
 things to get attacked with, infantry hates artillery the most. The way
 it comes from out of nowhere to kill you, the way you can\'t do anything
 but hunker down and hope they run out of ammo. I\'m imagining these
 grunts, if Shortstop works, fighting for the priviledge of wearing it
 (and thus being in the middle of the protection zone).

Sure it does... Strephon has apparently decided to make Isis Archduchess of
Ilelish.  Unless she\'s been "reprogammed" as well...  Still people that
powerful.  I\'d think it\'d be difficult for even the Emperor to get at her w/o
a fight (even if just a counter/intelligence type one)...

I\'d expect Iphegenia is in somewhat of a ivory tower.  Very isolated and
protected (and cloned).  ; )  She\'s 28 in 1116 and apparently childless and
unmarried... Social mores of the imperial family?

Why is Iphegenia the only child of Strephon and Iolanthe anyways?  Unless
they\'re quite... careful in trying to avoid dynastic struggles maybe.
Strephon has been married to Iolanthe since 1079...  in over 30 years of
marriage they only have one issue (surviving in 1116 anyways)?  There has to
be something up there. 

It is interesting that Strephon has Iolanthe\'s ova stored away... ala the
creation of Avery in the OTU timeline.  Does Strephon have any little swimmers
stored away in case of his own demise?

I see it as more of an immediate "oh shit, gotta go" type event that causes
Strephon to leave for the Longbow observations.  There were some serious
issues that demanded the Emperor\'s personal attention.  The clone was only
supposed to be for ceremonial purposes... smile and wave and make people
*think* the Emperor is there.  It was an issue of "Imperial Security."  I
would imagine there\'s a chain of command that Strephon would let know...
probably not Tranian (for fear of a possible power grab or something), but who
would anticipate the Emperor\'s ceremonial dummy being shot up by a visiting
Archduke who\'s supposed to be a friend of the Emperor?  What kind of crisis
can reach Capital in less than 7 weeks that the dummy can\'t "fake the funk on"
till the Emperor gets back?  Aside from him getting wacked by a certain
disastified Archduke of Ilelish?    ; )

The last person i would tell I was leaving my ceremonial dummy in charge would
be an Archduke.  All high nobility (at least down to the sector level) do the
cloning thing, so all know of their existence.  An Archduke is entirely too
powerful...  so would anyone in direct line for the throne (except maybe the
Grand Princess).   Politics in the Court, SolSec and maybe Zho spies...  There
was an urgency probably of "i\'ll be back before anyone knows I\'m gone..."

Supposedly he\'s in shock and being sedated by his doctor (Survival Margin pg
9) and the crew decides for the safety of the vacation palace at Usdiki.
Strephon goes along (despite the doc\'s impression of Strephon\'s "instinct")...
but from the description i see him in a depression/shock state. "We are going
to Usdiki.  Usdiki is a good place."

Otherwise this is the main flaw I see... it lets Lucan consolidate his
position.

I rather see the situation as unworkable to begin w/.  Something *must* have
been seriously wrong w/ the Imperium for it to become unglued the way it did.
It was only looking for an excuse to fly apart.  That excuse was the lack of
the One Clear Choice.

The premise of G:T is that the instability and undercurrents are still
there... it\'s just Strephon doesn\'t get wacked.  Note that Project Jumpstart
was started in 1103 due to information received from Longbow.  The disaster
was seen as coming...  it was just a different and earlier disaster due to the
assassination.

Maybe.  I might be unusually pessimistic, but I see very little possiblity of
the awesomely dynamic and complex threads presented in TNE to be present in
G:T.

I\'ve never said Richard was a bad king, just that he was generally held as
such. : )  England was only about half of the Platanaget domain.  It was
stable and secure in his reign, too.  The other half (Richards French
possessions) were almost continually under some sort of assault from Phillip
Augustus.  I would never have expected him to fawn on England while ignoring
the danger to his French possessions.

OB Trav...  Strephon was Archduke of Sylea and Marquis Usdiki (and i\'d suspect
quite a few others... Duke of Core Sector? Maybe G:T can clear this up...).
Did his duties as Emperor (much less personal belief) ever conflict w/ his
duties as ruler of smaller territories?  I\'d imagine Usdiki had to be run by
proxy, considering the realities of distance in Traveller.  As far as personal
belief... his "papers" in Survival Margin mention that he wanted to repeal the
Psionic Suppressions... might he do this in G:T?  SM indicates he doesn\'t
because of the evidence of a coming disaster from Longbow.

Should\'ve made Phillip stay as long as he did...  The decision to go on
crusade was demanded by public opinion (especially due to the disaster at
Hattin).  If either Richard or Phillip had refused to go, the other would have
gone even if just to gain the advantage (or deny the disadvantage) of the
other.  This seems the main reason Phillip goes on Crusade at all, since
Richard seemed genuine in his desire to fight for the cross.  That John was
left at home to scheme and screw up the administration just made things
worse...

Richard was Eleanor\'s favorite son.  Also OB Trav... what similar situations
must exist in the very high nobility?  Sons and daughters of Imperial and
Archducal families?  There is suprisingly little (notable) internal friction
mentioned... almost, i hestitate to say, unrealistically.  I can swallow the
rest but dynastic problems just seem to breed interal trouble (the reading of
Margaret\'s family in Rebellion is pretty interesting and along these lines, as
well).

> Sorry, it\'s just that this common view of Richard I bugs me.

Understandable. : )  I have a favorable opinion of Richard.  A real 3D
character... pros/cons, assets and faults.  I\'m inspired to create a planet in
the wilds (along w/ NCPs), methinks... ; )

That was what I did not know.  The time for a spherical search which is what

Not posible at those ranges.  The transmited power required would be
astranomical.  More that the total power output of a planet.  Calculate the
energy density at the shell then calculate the return signal with the
proviso that signal must be at least twice the background noise level.  Once
you see the numbers you will see why the area scaned must be limited to a
small fraction of the sphere even assuming a multimegawatt radar.  Also do
to multipath problems sweep rate will be limited by the propagation delay.
These are hard laws of the universe.  Light only travels so fast so scan
time is long for long range wide scan.  432 hours is probably unrealisticly
low for a spherical search by one sensor because the sensor will have to
move to complete that search due to blind spots caused by planets ect.  Also
that assumes no hit that must be checked out and cataloged into the space
debre catalog.  The space junk data base would be huge and the comp time
needed to identify and eliminate the junk would be sugnificant as each piece
makes it\'s own shadow that must be checked.  How would a ship know if the
new 30 meter object was junk, rock, or pirate?

70,000 hexes  of 30,000,km  that\'s ~ 1 ls.

Let\'s say the ship is traveling at .5c (not bloody likely)  You search  201
hexes the first second but add only 6 new hex per second after at maximum.
If you assume perfect efficency (imposible due to overlap) that\'s 

70,000-201= 69,799/6= 2366.5 That\'s 3.23 hours at 100% efficency and .5c!

reality would be more like .1 new hexes due to overlaping passes and
reasonable speeds or 8 days to search the shell for a quiet pirate and that
pirate could hit his target while you were on the oposite side of that
sphere.  30 ls away or 40 ls of travel time.  

The two good things about pasive sensors are they are fairly fast and quiet.  

All of this assumuses a perfect operater and that the pirate does not have a
brain cell in his head.  Said pirate could be in firing range of the sensor
ship with only two seconds warning and his weapons will be maned and ready.
The sensor ship could not maintain constant readiness.  It would have to out
mass the pirate 10 to one or more to stand a chance.  And even then it will
take an unanswered shot from the pirate unless it to is silent but if it is
it can not cordinate with the rest of the defence forces but a quiet ships
or two on the perimeter might not be a bad idea if you can afford it.  Life
support cost would be high as the crew would now want to eat recycled food
for six months at a time and god help the down port when they get leave!  

The crew would also have to be larger than normal with many highly skill
sensor techs.  Nobody can watch an instrament for long and remain alert.
You would also want two operaters on duty at all times to cut down on misses.

A few high speed passive sensor ships might be the best defense again
pirates though.  The price payed by the crews living that life would be very
high.  I\'d say that the antipiracy job would be a thankless lonely high
suicide rate one with the ships being pourly maintained in all but the
richest systems that an afford spares.  Look how we treat our policemen.

I would think that antipirate informatiom would be shared and these tactics
and the \'fact of pirate life\' would be well known.  I would also think that
\'chop shops\' and pirate bases would be necessary.  Perhaps the bases are in
the ort cloud region.  I dought anyone would be poking arroung out there and
there are fuel sources.

1296 pictures to be processed for a spherical search.  I assume computes do
the crunching.

At that level you could spot a 100 meter lighted object at (thinking)
5156km.  (1 pixel change at that range.)  You could get resoultion enough to
get basic shape at 51kms (100 pixels) with the same system but you would
probably use a higher power lower arc system to see it clearly sooner.  Not
a bad system.  Not bad at all.  Now, what is the light sensativity threshold
for one pixel?  How bright would that 100 mete object have to be the effect
that pixel from 5156 km out?

Sorry, I said the very same things in another post.  Stealth scattering in
very much affected by angle of attack but you can mannage  to stealth 3
sides of your narrow edge.  One for the merchant and one for the planet.
The other is wasted but it lets you pick your attack angle somewhat.

I\'m aware of the arc angle.  Are you aware of the angle of deffusion
available on lasers?  More than .001 second is a reject for good comercial
positioning use today much less high percission stuff.  We are talking
lasers (mono polar light) not telescopes.  They work very differently.  And
you do not need a telescope to launch the laser.  Course target it yes, fire
it know.  NASA uses a 2 foot relecter on the moon for laser distace
mesurements.  It was put up there by one of the apolo missions.  I do not
recall which one.

Quite true IF a multikilowatt xray laser weapon could and would be so
equipted on a reguler basis.  I dought it.  Drives the cost way up and would
not be needed for it\'s primary purpose.  Though if you had such a system it
would be a nasty sniper weapon.  What would you use for mirrors and lenses
for a Xray laser anyway?  Magnetic fields might work for lenses but what
could you make a 100% mirror for xrays out of?

The lag time would also throw a nasty PID loop constant into your control
loop making system osilation or PID windup a problem depending on the actual
numbers.  
Another problem would be correcting for ship manuvering and combat damage
venting.  A small change in delta V would make the loop have to relock if it
lost the preportional band which would have to be fairly narrow to allow
quick lockup and if you stayed in the pband then you would still have a
second or more before a intergral correction could take place.  Lock up time
would stink and you approach critical dampening.  Time here would not be
your friend.  "How close is that SDB?!?!?"  (Grin)

Ps: it\'s nice to discuss this with someone who knows his stuff.  You bring
up some interested points.  Some of which I had not figured into the mix.
I\'ll bet you\'d be fun to game with.

That depends on your assumtion that the laser is powered by other that heat.
A chemical or solid state laser could be designed to use heat as it\'s power
source.  There are thermal cell just like solar cells and some of the new
solar cells use waste heat to boost poer output.  As this is a non nuclear
action the laws of conservation applies.  Total power out must be eqaul to
total power in.  If you dump 20% out as IR laser energy then you reradiate
80%  That\'s still a system loss of heat of 20% because it leaves the ship.
Without nuclear reations matter and energy are conserved.

True 100watts in = 90 watts of laser out and 10 waste watts of heat or
whatever the ratio would be in 5000 years.

Again it depend on you assumtion.  If you assume a high efficency insulation
and mininal power, just enough for life support and passive sensors your
outside temp would be only a few degrees warmer than space.  Apollo could
maintain life support, manuver, sensors, and comunications on 40 watts of
power with body heat alone heat keeping the cabin at arround 20 degrees.
They pirate could use battery power and light off his reacter only to make
his attack.

The IR laser cooler is not really needed.

This is certainly true..it was directed at the whole overriding purpose of the

I am afraid I will have to annoy you again.  Dr Robert Ballard, after finding
and photographing the wreck of the Bismarck, said that due to the way the
wreck sat on the bottom and a # of other things, there was ample evidence that
the Bismarck was indeed scuttled by the crew.

I personally believe that the Bismarck would have sank eventually anyway, but
the RN was close enough to have boarded the ship...maybe recieving valuable
info in the process.

The RN assertion that the HMS Dorsetshire torpedoed Bismark, causing her to
sink, is nothing more than wartime morale-building propoganda:  Dr Ballard
discovered no signs of any damage to the belt armor/waterline of the side of
the ship struck by the "torpedoes".

You might try the National Geographic website...they should have all the info
on the Bismarck expedition (they funded it)

Hmmm. Since when is informing your liege that an attempt is to

  The first statement seems to require an awfully low assessment of Imperial
escort assets; all resources that specifically state scale directly as being 
one to one give truly astronomical numbers of small warships/boats to the
Imperium and its\' member-states.

  In peacetime, having the Imperium let anti-piracy work be done by units
that may very well be part of the problem looks awfully like intentionally
creating a situation where piracy can exist.

  What if the insurance companies association (which _will_ be a powerful

In my M:0 game, X-TEK was experimenting with the possibility of a Spinal
Plasma Gun.  The robot ship that carried this mostrosity was destroyed in
a cataclysmic explosion.  The blast was so powerful, even coming from the
barrel that it was enough to cause heat and radiation damage to the ship,
but the real clincher was the recoil.  The "Kick" was enough to rip the
gun right off the ship!

This brought the saftey inspectors down on the Commander\'s rear, and X-TEK
was fined for "unsafe practices" or somesuchthing.  Makes me wonder why
they were bugging me and not the Spofulam kids!  ;-)

The IMTU code for piracy is pi

        pi++    Piracy exists and is rampant.  Anyone may commit piracy.
                Ship tracking and ID are uncommon.
        pi+     Piracy exists.  Antipiracy is mostly political or economic,
and
                is inadequate.  Transponders may be changed or masked, or
are
                not widespread or sufficient.
        pi      Piracy only exists in the vacuum of government or corporate
                morals.
        pi-     Piracy is not sustainable.
        pi--    Piracy is impossible.

Lucan and Varian were the cadet line, right?  If Strephon died, the Iphegina
assumed the rule (provided the Moot concurred), and would be followed by
Iolanthe.  (This assumes I have the names of the Empress and the Grand
Princess correct... :)

I\'d have to say that not only do you not want to encourage the cadet line by
giving them the training to assume the Imperium - you would not want to
embitter them by forever denying them it once you have prepared them.

The Imperium was not at war, and there was no reason to assume (other than
basic precautions) that the entire ruling house would be wiped out in a
single blow.  Only treachery made that possible, and IMHO, no normal
security would have sufficed when the blow comes from someone who was
trusted to the extent that Dulinor was.

I would say that it is very likely that his wife and daughter were very much
aware that he was away from the Capital, and were probably supporting the
clone to maintain the pretense.   It is very likely that he felt that his
departure would cause some ruffled feathers, and chose to use the clone and
secrecy to avoid that.  I rather imagine that the p&c surrounding an
official visit by the Emperor may have been a consideration, since Longbow
was supposed to be a secret.

It\'s a control thing.  The \'feel\' of controlling a missile bay would be a

I hardly ever play with sand.  But the armour is a given; only warships will 
have bay weaponry.  IMNSFBHO, \'merchants\' with spinal mounted PA\'s are just 
plain *SILLY*.  They\'re using vaulable cubic they *COULD* be using to make 
*MONEY* with.  Same way with bay weaponry.  Under HG, you can use an empty bay 
for cargo space, but you can only use 50% of it.  For a merchie, that\'s 
uneconomic.

It depends.  A cultural extension is going to go a long way to defining
the culture of a planet.  And consequently, diminsh or limit a referee\'s
freedom of movement for creating within the constraints of that. Of
course, such ref\'s could ignore it.

Having said that, it would be extremely convenient for me.
And it might help enhance advanced trade rules.

Do you want to stay away from the World Character stuff from Pocket
Empires?  (Progression, Planning, Advancement, Growth, Militancy,
Unity, Tolerance).  I think some of them could be broken out.

Some possible suggestions:
- -Xenophobia/Xenophilia (Tolerance?)
- -Psioniphobia/Psioniphilia (Tolerance?)
- -Language Diversion
- -Militancy
- -Creativity (to indicate relative amount of art, research, etc)
- -Loyalty (to Imperium or other political group to which the system
belongs.  If an independent system, loyalty to the system\'s government,
a sort of hand-waved satisfaction with government.  Low loyalty =
potentially rebellioius).

If I had to pick four:
- -Creativity
- -Xenophobia (applying to all off-worlders, not just racial)
- -Militancy
- -Loyalty

Adding all these to the government type and law level go a long way
to painting a fast but good picture of a system.

Delta-V is the *rate* of change.  A 4G ship has 4 times the Delta-V of a 1G ship.

The "planet" in this case consists of a distributed network of
sensors, as well as some pickets out around 100Diameters, right?

I agree that on backwater worlds without a sophisticated net it\'ll
be possible, but richer worlds will be much harder since the
planetray defences will be spread out over a 100 diameter radius
sphere.

I get it very well but as you say later, give them some credit for brains.
They come in oposite the planet, use gravity breaking and catch their prize
on the outward leg.  That is why they need a high delta V to start with.
They come up behind the target as it is acelerating out.  Best posible time.
They are far from the system and close to the jump diameter.  They have to
be quick but then they have to anyway.  If the main world has or is a moon
so much the better for the pirates.

Depends on planetary day lenght and relative entry point.  It could make a

What is true in CT is not always true TNE.  You have to watch for the

It\'s pretty good but it will play hell with your economic of the military.
Spend to much and you get a recession.  Oh, and all military spending come
out of the same pot not just the navy.

Then how much time do the crew get for leave?  Two weeks a year?  Talk about

I do not have a problem with that.  I never said the escort HAD to be small.
I said I had a problem with a 5000 ships sector navy.  Your quote about does
NOT say that it ONLY included HEAVY escort.  The \'and some escort\' could be
dismissive for several reasons such as they are few or have little
firepower.  It does not say so.  You could be right that only heavy escort
are counted but you could also be wrong.  Just as that 1% could be all navy
ships including auxilleries.  IT does not say and we do not know for sure.

Some of the TNS articals included the names of the ships and their classes
that were in those fleets.  Also some mention total ship losses as well.
The production information for the Marches in in the AHL and Kinuneer books
as well as some more combat history.  From those I\'d say that 1000 ships
including escorts sounds about right.

A little light in my opinion but that could also explain \'and some escort\'

Is there canan saying aux. ships are in a different budget.  I\'ll give you
the \'coast gaurds\' are.  There is canon to support that. lots of canon.

It is classed a cruiser,  perhaps a light cruiser.  As for the AHL I am at
work but that number sounds right.  If memory is accuarate they were built
over a long time period and all of then were not in sevice at on time.
There may be some extrapolatable data of ship down time in there some were.
I\'ll try to check tonight.

The AHLs production run and lossed if memory serves would have kept a
minimum of 30 on line at any one time.  (I\'ve got to reread it.  I got it
out for this reason)  AHL was being replace while in production with heavier
ships with less jump capacity.  It\'s long legs made it a bit of an ugly
duckling so its\' numbers could be scued.  The Kenineer could be one of the
special escorts you mentioned through now that I think it through.  It has

But what is a fleet in terms or ships? 10? 20? 100?  What is a typical break

I never seen a TNS artical dealing with this size formation and Fighting

Not posible.  The size of the dock alone would be half again as big as the
biggest ship it could hold.  Plus all the equipment and spare parts.  It
does not make sence.  Also the naval base is equivalent to a type A star
port in cannon.  Loke at the cost in T4 to build a class A!  It take 20
years of planetary level income!

And the US has not built a new carrier in a decade.  They are getting ready

Yup, they are. Or at least enough to do drive by shootings. Had a friend
teaching in Chicago one year. He left after a drive-by, with automatic
weapons. 

(Not trying to reopen the debate about whether guns are a cause or product
of the incredible violence in American society. I can game it either way,
and not living or vacationing there I\'m not too worried about it in real
life.  Just pointing out that for cultural reasons American society
tolerates higher homicide rates than, say, Canada.)

So maybe there\'s a clause in Imperial law allowing merchants to be armed.
It was originally put in place to permit Imperial Chartered merchants to
refuse non-Imperial customs inspections. Since then it has been jealously
guarded by the Imperial Merchants Association, even though the original
reasons no longer apply (because most merchants trade exclusively with
Imperial worlds now).

Because whenever the Imperial Safety inspectors have gotten anywhere

fresh tattoos in very personal places, ritual scarring on their chests,
fragmentary and hallucinatory memories of the intervening time, a

Except that traffic control probably isn\'t going to make people "park".

Merchants are 1G, patrol craft are 3G to 6G. Every hour a merchant
has to sit and wait is lost income. The merchant will request an
vector towards their destination and accelerate/decelerate along
it, the patrol ship will use their larger acceleration advantage to
catch the merchant.

Traffic control will space incoming merchants along these flight paths
based on a good landing interval between 1G ships. Except for
approaches to high-security sites (Naval Depots, Impie Prison Planets,
etc) the emphasis will be on maximizing starport usage, not on
keeping the ships far enough apart that they can\'t suddenly turn
on an extra couple of G\'s and attack each other.

OK, so we have a number of ships in the system greater than n, but small

We also have a tax base small enough to support one active patrol boat

Are both these conditions credible ? Would a class D or E system (from the
sounds of it, that seems to be about what you are describing) have this
level of traffic ?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
You\'re not worried about all the patrol boats. You\'re worried about
the patrol boats that can intercept you.

Some are in the shop. Some are on the pad. Some are hiding at the
bottom of the oceans, or deep in the asteroid belt, or way out in the
oort cloud, or in close orbit (or inside) the local gas giants. Some are
docked with ships that required extensive search (and seizure?). Some
are on maneuvers with the Subsector Fleet five parsecs from here.
Some are simply assigned to traffic patterns that take them too far
away from the current location of the disguised pirate to be a factor
for the time frame involved.

How many system patrol boats does it take to pull customs duty
on one inbound traffic pattern? Remember that some of these
traffic patterns will take a couple days to fly, I can see one ship
pulling board & inspection duty on lots of merchants. All the pirate
needs is one window of opportunity...and based on my economics
analysis, I\'d say a pirate can afford to be patient.

It is also a neat bit of sensor work to detect if it\'s new or not from
sensor readings at the sort of ranges I think you\'re talking about. About
size, power plant output and current gees is about it, I think. Still,
enough to create a target profile.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
There may be some "tells" for this kind of thing - how crisp is the
emissions profile change when the Fat Trader powers up for a
significant course change? How much interference in the transponder
signal? I agree that it\'s good sensor work, but hey - If your sensor crew 
isn\'t good at picking targets, you\'ll not do well as a Corsair. Knowing the
difference between the emissions profile of a recently-maintained Fat 
Trader and that of an armored Q-Ship is kind of vital. People who get 
really good at this kind of thing start to do scary things with what looks 
like incomplete data.

"Yeah, it\'s a Fat Trader all right. Hear that whine on the power
emission static? She\'s got a new load on her power system,
it hasn\'t stablized yet - probably a new laser weapon mount."

(For comparison, check out what some submarine sonar officers
are capable of).

This is no choice, to me at least. The crew are absolutely safe in the
rescue balls. I mean, if you cant survive in one for time for help to
arrive, what use are rescue balls ?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Rescue balls are designed to protect the occupant inside a
depressurized ship, and so a vac suited individual can transport
the occupant to a pressurized area. They are not lifeboats, nor
even vac suits - think of them more like life jackets in a rather hostile
ocean. IMO, someone who dumped a crew out an airlock
in rescue balls should be charged with reckless endangerment. 

I\'m talking about the Cr600 plastic bags here - I\'m sure we could
have better models available, for a price.

It\'s a control thing.  The \'feel\' of controlling a missile bay would be a

I hardly ever play with sand.  But the armour is a given; only warships
will
have bay weaponry.  IMNSFBHO, \'merchants\' with spinal mounted PA\'s are just
plain *SILLY*.  They\'re using vaulable cubic they *COULD* be using to make
*MONEY* with.  Same way with bay weaponry.  Under HG, you can use an empty
bay
for cargo space, but you can only use 50% of it.  For a merchie, that\'s
uneconomic.
**************
if you are thinking of the same merchants I am, they are really strike
cruisers in diguise :)

so the Bays are ok.  about the armor though...only some ships will have
lots of armor,  the armor slows you down, and if you are high jump or
carrying troops/fighters  you may not have room for the bigger manuver
drive needed for the extra mass of the armor.

I\'ve seen some nice Q-ship designs. A 400tn armored beast, same lines
as a Fat Trader but twice the turrets and a lot more legs. Even has a
small cargo capacity for vital freight. Nasty last thing a Corsair

The 400tn Patrol Cruiser design in CT seems to suggest that this craft
is seen in the hands of private security forces, and the Al Morai
Route Protectors (I have heard) are a canonical group of privately-owned
Gazelle Close Escorts, used for escort duty.

Guesstamate.  The ships would take at least one broadside as the weapons
were unmaned and probably a second before the crew made it to stations and
got up to snuff.  How many ship could fight effectively after receiving a
broadside from an equal weight ship with max weaponry?  I\'d target the
weapons and drives on the first pass if I were that pirate.

The ort cloud is beyond the orbit of pluto and completely circles our solar

Care to guess how long it would take the SDBs to get there on manuver drives?

Gotta disagree here...

CVN-72 USS Abraham Lincloln, commissioned 11/11/89
CVN-73 USS George Washington, commissioned 7/4/92
CVN-74 USS John C. Stennis, commissioned 12/9/95
CVN-75 USS Harry S. Truman, commissioned 7/25/98

and CVN-76 USS Ronald Reagan is currently under construction

And more are on the way.  Authorization was recently granted for the CVX
with a combat airwing of about 75 AC.

This is in addition to all of the Burke class DDGs built to date and the
balance of the Ticonderoga class CGs.  And that is just major surface
combatants, it is not counting the SSBN and two classes of SSN and the new
class of SSN in development.

I\'d vote for it.  It would give referee\'s a little more idea of the world
than the current UWP without (hopefully) being too rigid.

Is there any chance I could resurrect my idea of a couple of years back to
include some idea of what \'net/information/library facilities are
like/available/allowed?  I don\'t think this is necessarily going to be a
direct function of TL (though related) and do think that it\'s something
that can enhance role playing rather just being extra detail.

Other possibilities might include:
some kind of language code
some of the _World Builder\'s Handbook_ type details

Yeah, I realized later I was thinking about something else

I\'m not sure what.

Assuming there are enough patrol vessels in the mainworld orbit to manage
the traffic.  A class D starport may be lucky to have an armed shuttle.  A

definition, a cleared spot of bedrock...) - provided that the starport is

Those are officers in a specialized field using the best technology the

using local equipment to try and determine the sensor readings from a TL-B
ship?  Assuming that the ship is not actually using TL-D ECM equipment.

To give time for the crew to survive until rescue arrives.  Not to wait out
an extended period while the \'rescue\' goes haring off after who knows what.
Assuming, of course, that the patrol ship survives the encounter.

Remember:
 1) Rescue balls, by definition, are not launched under ideal conditions.
 2) They may contain wounded
 3) Maintenance on such items is (ahem) usually spotty at best - you can\'t
count on optimum performance.
 4) There has got to be a real psychological effect to having your ship
blown out from under you, stuffing yourself into a plastic bag and ejecting
from the ship - and then waiting to be either rescued or run out of air.

    'body' => 'The Kinunirs are very interesting vessels. Much of this is the result of
being transition designs from Book 2 to High Guard, but nevertheless...

Originally concieved as vanguard cruisers (whatever that meant), a shift
in policy saw a redesign and conversion to colonial cruisers
("euphemistically called battle cruisers").

What is a Colonial Cruiser and why the euphemism? Obviously not a ship for
the colonial navy, since they were built for Imperial service.

Examining the design, it is fairly clear that it cannot stand up to line
of battle and in fact the design history supports this, with Allamu being
"caught in the van" at the Two Suns (where it obviously wasn\'t supposed to
be) and getting toasted. The Ninkur Sagga fought on the flank of same
battle; obviously the Kinunirs might be committed to fleet action if
nessasary. They also escorted Haunting Thunder during the Fourth Frontier
war on a commerce raiding mission.

But what were they good for? Kinunir has them primarily tooling about on
independent operations. And that, I think, is what they are for. Not big
enough to make a big fuss, but large enough to protect themselves in peace
time. They are there to intimidate individual low-tech planets...
basically, they are for gunboat diplomacy of the British colonial type. A
kinunir with its Marine platoon (nuclear armed!) and missile turrets (with
nuke warheads) can inflict a lot of devastation in a punative raid. TL5
world has kidnapped trade reps? TL7 planet has a hostage situation at the
imperial consul\'s residence? Some pesky corsair in a stolen X-boat tender
shooting up shipping across the sector? Local ancient site need some
protection? Send a kinunir. It combines planetary bombardment and marine
special operations capability in one tidy package, it\'s got good jump legs
and, most of all, it has one special edge: that puzzling little factor 1
black globe generator.

Moderately useless in combat, it has one big advantage: against a world,
the kinunir class can jump in well outside planetary detection range,
locate the present planetary orbit and where it will be, build up a little
velocity, globe on, and come in invisible. This lets them ignore any
system defense boat patrols until the last moment. If necessary, the
kinunirs effectively have the capability (by uncloaking near orbit) to
mount a surprise nuclear missile strike on any planet not well equipped
enough to have nuclear damper systems and extensive anti-missile defenses
and the discipline to turn \'em on with practically no warning (and a lot
of planets will have cities or other installations that aren\'t protected
- -- imagine what a salvo from six triple missile turrets can do to your
crop lands). They can also do other tricks, e.g., releasing the pinnace
with a marine force aboard while following englobed -- as long as the
pinnace follows a straight course, there is a cruiser ready and invisible. 

Of course, this is a nasty capability and a nasty job, which is why the
kinunirs are *euphemistically* battle cruisers. You don\'t want to admit
the main purpose of them is to be a roving Imperial Marine special
operations and pocket strike cruiser designed to be able to keep jerkwater
worlds in line. Of course, the Vegans are a bit more honest: you will note
that they Regal Splendor has "served mainly in the insurrection suppress
role" since it was shipped to them in 1092. Want to bet the Vegans
installed the missile racks soon after the Impies removed \'em?

Just as a side note tho\' - according to the last figures I saw (a few years
ago, admittedly), we were only building to a sustained fleet size of 160 -
240 ships.  (8 new constructions per year, 20 - 30 year design life).

That\'s roughly 1/3 the size that was looked at in the early 80\'s and half of
the fleet size needed to successfully carry off Desert Storm.

My "requests":

1) Xenophobia/Xenophilia scale
2) Civil Law - Personal freedoms other than weapons
3) Weapons Law - what weapons are allowed
4) Criminal Enforcement - Chance of encountering LEnf, plus tenacity thereof.
5) (How to lable this one is a problem) a scale which indicates how much
the locals are likely to accuse non-locals of crimes without obvious
suspects.
6) how much they appreciate the arts.
7) how much they appreciate/trust the sciences.
8) how much they appreciate/trust the media...

Working his subsidized route. Routes are subsidized for some reason. Oft,
this is due to a poor route that needs a ship or 3 running it regularly.
Subbies, based upon TTA, have no freedom of course in typical operations:
45 weeks per year they operate on the given route. They get 5 weeks "route
Free", and 2 weeks for annual maintenance. They can bank the free weeks.
They turn over half their profits as their monthly payment... no profits,
and they must simply submit the proofs.

obviously, the Imperial government has set prices at CrImp 1000 per ton
freight. Which is why it would seem most shipping would be done via
speculative cargo... where net take per ton can usually run aroun 1200-1500
cr/ton. Likewise, Cr8000 and Cr10000 for mid and high passages. These costs
are per jump. Per jump makes no sense, so it is an obvious pricefix
designed to discourage high-jump merchants.

Since it is obvious that there is price-fixing, if the Impies say "You
can\'t charge more", and catch you doing so, you lose. So you simply don\'t
go, unless you have a really good speculative cargo with an excellent
trader roll, and can afford the protection or the risk.

Hmmm... maybe there should be a table of loading and unloading times.... I
know battletech has one (somewhere in the rules <G>)... I\'ll see if I can
find and adapt the Battletech one.

And I\'ve read a reference that Al Morai\'s route protectors sometimes turn

If it says "Striker 2", it is the TNE version, which lacks the economica of
the CT version (which has 3 little black books...)

But it now (in GT) gives one every month: Cr7200 per month, rather than
Cr4500 per month. So it\'s some 60% more return now. Monthly mids actually
makes more sense to me... a reasonable rate of return over 10 years.

I like it. 

What about:
- - Communal Perspective
    I remember, in my university days, discussing a sociological theory 
(I don\'t remember whose)that the further north a country was located the 
more likely it was going to have a "sense of community"
ingrained in its laws and culture.  I, personally, find the idea a 
little too simplistic.  Nevertheless the concept that a group of people 
who share a difficult existence have a larger sense of community is not 
completely out of whack.  
  Consequently the argument can be made that the more hazardous the 
living conditions the higher chance of a culture that works on an 
egalitarian principle (I am intentionally avoiding a right-left 
discussion).
  Notwithstanding the xenophobic dimension, the prospects for adventures 
are intriguing.  
   A planet\'s culture that sees itself as a family could have all sorts 
of help for the downtrodden, and be a very big headache for those who 
are viewed as \'privileged\'.

- - Conservatism (with regards to protocols)
  Because of its political connotation I would prefer to use another 
word, but this is all I can think of right now.
  I am referring to how important planetside protocols and rituals are.
  Here on earth (I know some of you visit sometimes), breaching a 
tradition can have different effects:
  "You\'re leaving the faith for an inter-racial marriage, and bringing 
up my grandkids as atheists?"
 Depending on what faith you are leaving you might merely receive a 
shrug from your friends and family or much much worse.
   Not to mention what happens when a PC shakes hands with an embassy 
official - an insult on planet X.
   Does he laugh out loud and point out the mistake, or ...

- - Diversity
  Is the planet a homogeneous group, a melting pot, a diverse 
multicultural mix?  Segregated warring cultures?

I think a rich culture can be one of the keystones to a good campaign.
I could go on and on with what I would like to see, but we need to save 
some work for the GM.

PE Culture Score, then Individuality, Income Distribution and I cant think
of a good fourth.

Culture in PE is a pretty good definition.

Individuality measures how group-dominated individuals in that society are.
1 is totally individual centered, 15 is totally group centered.

Income Distribution - 1 is total income inequality, 15 is total income
equality.

Used in combination with the UWP, you should get a good view of a society. 

For example, assuming Australia is 777, the US would be 855 and the old
Soviet Union would have been 5A9.

In conjuntion with the UWP government types and Law Levels, this should
give you people a better idea of what a society looks like.

I don\'t consider these four as "Cultural."  But I\'m curious, have you
seen the "extra" 30 pages of Milieu 0 Hardcover?  There is a
Universal Law Profile?  It has 7 additional categories:

Armament: traditional weapons, CT law level scale.
Commerce: degree of business regulations, safety requirements, pollution, etc.
Communication: obvious
Congregation : obvious
Movement: obvious
Privacy: obvious
Process: the rules of law including standards of guilt/innocence, punishment,
and how the rule of law is established (precedent, case by case, statutes,
or arbitrary).

> 6) how much they appreciate the arts.

I agree with these.  Although I would group them as Creativity.

> .8) how much they appreciate/trust the media...

How often is the media relevant to your campaigning?
It rarely comes up in mine.

Magnetic fields don\'t work to bend X-rays, but there are certain surfaces
that will bounce them at particular angles.  There\'s an x-ray telescope up

Skipping, mutiny, and piracy are big risks for a bank making a loan for a
ship.  If they even THINK the ship might skip, they\'ll forget the whole idea.

Here\'s my proposal: There\'s a reason the \'Merchant\' career is pretty much
required in CT in order to get a merchant ship as a mustering-out benefit.
The banks only loan to people with a reputation in the industry, people
with references, people with a reputation to uphold.  Just getting the
money for a down payment together isn\'t enough... you\'ve got to be part of
the \'old boy network\'.

It may be a handwave, but gravity manipulation is very much a part of the
Traveller universe.

Could gravity manipulation help with stealth, lowering IR signatures

	This is why mega-corps and nobles are important to the economic 
management of the Imperium over these vast distances.  By internalizing 
transactions, the mega-corp faces much lower risks of default or 
self-interested behavior because all parties involved are part of the 
same profit/loss unit.  Nobles and other highly visible people carefully 
guard their reputations for reliability because this is what allows 
gov\'ts and businesses to entrust them with sensitive tasks that must be 
conducted at great distance from headquarters.  Since its reputation is 
a noble family\'s most valuable asset, they will carefully monitor their 
own members for signs of deviance.  Those who demonstrate they are not 
worthy of acting on the family\'s behalf are the ones given yachts and 
told to see the Imperium (i.e. become PCs).  It is certainly possible 
for one part of a megacorp to be taking advantage of another part of a 
megacorp because of political or parochial interests, but it is less 
likely.
	Also note, Hortalez et Cie specializes in financing interstellar 
ventures.  It is likely that one of their chief advantages is credit 
files on as many significant players as possible.  Having an account with 
Hortalez et Cie could be the ultimate letter of reference to any local 
financial institution.  TAS may also play a similar, though much more minor, 
role.

I\'d like to see the generic Law Level redifined to be an indicator of
personal liberty, with weapon limits being a by-product of that level.

If its reached the point of giving it to the 82nd to,play with, it has
already been written up in about ten Army journals, been through three
Boards, and been handled by hundreds of troops.

They already know.

Compendium I was just reprinted not too long ago; it should not be out of

Well, I\'d probably be willing to submerge an SDB if I _really_ needed to hide
it.  No point to a regular submarine most of the time.

Bruce is an astrophysicist - he\'s talking about his specialty here.  Ships
will have to accelerate continually to get to the Oort base, or jump
there, and jump \'flare\' is already part of Traveller canon.  Assuming
dedicated orbital sensor stations, it wouldn\'t be that long before the
visiting ships were detected.  We can detect planets around neighbouring
stars, after all, and Traveller starships (all Traveller tech, actually)
produce lots of waste heat.

Assuming continuous acceleration? Care to do the calculation? 

Yes, I can do it myself, and no, I\'m not going to do it for you. I\'m
getting a little tired of hearing guesses and assertions when a few
minutes thought or a bit of research would produce a different answer. 
This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation, strictly high school physics,
no calculus involved, clearly not a problem for an engineer.  

You say you are an engineer: then start doing your part by contributing
some thought and knowledge, and using that expensive training. You say you
are extremely busy: then post more reasoned messages less often.

Well, all you really need to do is get a jump field around them.  While
probably expensive, I can postulate some sort of grappling arm arrangement that
could project a jump field around it.  Considering the existance of battle
riders, this shouldn\'t be too out there.  Then you just need to extend your
jump field around your target ship and jump.  Probably inside the hundred
diameter limit, probably dangerous because of the extra ship involved.  I don\'t
know that I\'d advise it, but if you kidnap an inbound ship, it probably doesn\'t
have the fuel needed to jump to safety.  So, once you\'ve dragged them off to
your secret base, they\'re at your mercy for return fuel.  I\'d recommend using a
nuclear damper to shut down your target\'s power plant before trying this stunt.

based on FSSI the escorts included in the 1000 ship sector navy are
between 5000T and 20000T

It is classed as a Colonial Cruiser which according to FSSI means that
it was to be used in the reserve fleet.

According to the Rebellion Sourcebook:
"Each SECTOR of the Imperium Theoretically has a group of fleets
numbering about 1000 ships."  The way I read this is that the total
number of major combatants in each sector should be 1000 if at full
strength.  "Reserve fleets are technically considered part of a named
fleet..."  This indicates to me that the reserves are included in this
number also.   "At thier lowest level, Imperial ships are organized into
squadrons (from three to 10 similar ships). Squadrons are grouped into
permanant numbered fleets (usually three to 10 squadrons per fleet)..."
This makes a Numbered Fleet between 9 and 100 major combatants.  With 16
numbered fleets and 16 reserve fleets this brings the number of ships
per sector to between 288 and 3200 ships.

FSSI shows that the average size of a squadron is 5 combat ships, 3
scouts, and 4 non-combatants.

The reserve fleets will be next to useless for anti piracy as they are
manned by reservists and thus spend most of thier time in orbit around
the high tech, high population worlds in the subsector they are
assigned.  Although these could be operated almost continously as
additional sensor platforms. This would have the benifit that pirates
would not visit these worlds very often.  Also the Navy would keep the
squadrons together so that they will be ready to fit as a group.  This
is good for both sides if the navy catches the pirate then it is a
search and destroy mission, for the pirate they know there is better
hunting elsewhere and leave.

Then they flag EVERY ship I design, normally I add a small power plant
that can handle life support or weapons.  several of my ships have 3 to
4 power plants.

No kidding.  In fact, as I was reading through the original post (and
before it got to the description of how it\'s actually meant to be used),
I assumed that Shortstop was just such a system.  Point your transmitter
at the enemy and watch them get blown up by their own ammo.

Scary, man.

Ships in traveller are *bright*. In terms of _detection_ (very
different from resolving a target) it doesn\'t really matter how far
away it is if it is bright enough*. You are scanning the whole sky
regardless of target distance. True you might simply see a single
bright pixel, hell the target might take a day to move out of that
one pixel, but the pixel will still be brighter than background. The
only way it takes more time to scan is if you decide to integrate
longer to see fainter sources. I could be wrong, but I\'d likely scan
at the integration time needed for 100D defense, and add the frames
together to look for indications of fainter sources out in the void.
If I saw something in an added frame set that wasn\'t in the normal
scan, I\'d know it was fainter. I could then dedicate a tighter scan
at higher resolution and longer integration time on that specific
area to get more data.

(* big caveat, it needs to be fairly bright--distance obviosly comes
into play in terms of square-law reductions, and masking a drive is
far easier when the sensor array subtends a very small angle)

The bigger problem is simply that the light will take so long to get
to your sensor that the data will be very old.

Bottom line is that if Bruce says it\'s bright enough, it likely is
:-)

A craft designed to be a submarine specifically would probably have better
performance than an SDB... hydrodynamics is different from aerodynamics,
and it would probably go faster.  It could tailor its stealth to the
underwater environment, and tailor its sensors.  If the SDB could take the
fight to space, it would have the edge.

I thought nuclear dampers only shut down UNcontrolled nuclear reactions...

I was under the impression that the ECM program for starship computers was

The system can detect objects much further than 5156; objects don\'t need to 
be resolved (bigger than one pixel) to be detected - you can detect something
that\'s a tiny fraction of a pixel quite easily. (For example, Saturn is about 
a tenth of a pixel on your eye.) The PEMS described above, with ~2-3m telescopes,
can detect a 99% black scout-sized starship at about (if I recall correctly)
That\'s a 20-sigma detection - pretty unambiguous. Space is dark. Ships - even
black ships - are bright.

I\'m not sure where you\'re 0.001 second (presumably you mean arcseconds?)
number comes from. It might be the mean positioning accuracy or stability of
the beam - though that sounds somewhat too good and I\'d like a citation. 
That\'s *not* the amount the beam spreads out by. Spreading of any beam is
fundamentally limited by the diffraction limit of its launch aperture, with
the spread angle given by wavelength / diameter of the launch aperture.
That\'s why you need a telescope-like device to launch a beam and expect it 
to stay reasonably collimated; if you launch the beam from the 1-mm output
of a typical commercial laser, the beam will be spreading at about 10^-3
radians or a twentieth of a degree. By the time it reaches the moon it would
be 250 miles across. NASA\'s lunar rangefinding experiments are launched
from the earth through 0.5 - 3 m telescopes; by the time the beam reaches
the moon it is a few miles across. (Only the portion of the beam that hits
the 2 foot reflector is returned to the earth, of course, which might be what
is confusing you.) 

Trust me. I do this for a living. (Almost literally; one of the experiments
I\'m involved in is projecting a laser (attached to the Lick 3-m telescope) 
to make a star-like spot on the mesospheric sodium layer 100km up.)

It\'s certainly how real laser weapons will be designed - cf AvWeek articles
on the YAL-1. A precision steering mirror and closed-loop tracking system 
is only $50 - $100 K. (Again, I do this for a living - I\'m involved with
the group building the AO system for the Lick and Keck telescopes - so I know
this for a fact.)

Magnetic fields don\'t bend light.

The question of mirrors for x-rays is more interesting; presumably the
fact that x-ray lasers don\'t come into use until TL-13 allows a certain 
amount of time to solve the problem.

>The lag time would also throw a nasty PID loop constant into your control
Details of the control loop can be left unspecified. The adaptive controllers
we use for tip/tilt correct out to 100 Hz and respond rapidly to changing
atmospheric turbulence; I doubt any maneuvers a spacecraft could make would
be a problem for them, since spacecraft typically vary their course somewhat
slower than that.

This is more a problem with Traveller overall, in that life support takes
really ludicrous amounts of power (megawatts) in most Traveller incarnations.
Still, even if life support is free, a pirate-quality passive sensor array
will take tens of kilowatts or more, the crew will generate a few kilowatts,
ten kilowatts leaking through a thousand square meters of hull still warms
it up to a moderately-detectable 100K. Much more problematical is the fact
that your pirate has to have a black hull (so as not to be seen in reflected
sunlight), which means it\'s absorbing a kilowatt per square meter of
solar heat - you\'ll need to actively refrigerate the hull and dump that heat
out somewhere, which requires more power - a nasty cycle.

Actually, I don\'t think I said anything - at least not Ex Cathedra - about
the Oort Cloud. Looking at the DSR numbers, really big military arrays - the
kind a pop-10 world will have - can see capital ships in the inner Oort
cloud (which was sort of deliberate; you want to be able to see the Zho\'s
doing ice refuelling out there, otherwise the FFW degenerates to fights only
at key worlds...). However, a typical backwater sensor array won\'t be able to
see a typical pirate in even the Kuiper belt, let alone the inner or outer
Oort cloud, so pirate bases in the clouds are semi-practical. Hard to catch
merchants from the Oort cloud, but that\'s a lesser issue. If microjumps only
require a small amount of fuel (canon is unclear on this issue) it might help.

I think dampers are directional and take electricity for energy.  So, unless you
turn the damper on your own power plant, you should be set.

Of course, I really have no idea how a damper works, so this is just idle
speculation.

It should be noted that the colonial forces are taken out of that theoretical
1000 ships...  "Reserve fleets are technically considered part of the forces
of a named fleet, but are rarely moved out of their original subsector." -
Rebellion pg 27.  This drops your average 62.5-combatant fleet by half.

They\'re also in Battle Rider. : )  CT (Fighting Ships) makes no reference to
these larger escorts, defining escorts as "small ships of up to 5,000 tons"
meant to be support craft for larger ships, primarily cruisers.  You\'re the CT
guy, ain\'t you, Hans? ; )

The production order of Azhanti\'s was 100.  92 were built. There is one more
example I know of...  Fighting Ships says there were 794 Atlantic class CRs
built of which ~500 remained in service c1100.   People think Azhanti names
were convoluted... like to see someone name 794 ships. ; )

You\'d have to cut that to 31.25 (combatant) ships due to a fuller and in-
context reading of Rebellion.  Note that the Midu\'s are described in Fighting
Ships as being in limited production.  Their purpose is to be an escort that
supplements fleet defenses w/ anti-fighter and anti-small craft ship.  They
were committed "to operations only with the Navy\'s major battle fleets."

The Named Fleets are umbrella organizations.  One Named Fleet for each sector.
All regular and colonial fleets are member of the named sector fleet.  Fleets
can be pulled from their Named Fleet and assigned to named \'Special Fleets\'
ala the "Vengeance Fleet", "the Loyal Fleet", etc etc. but there aren\'t
additional (numbered) fleets created for just that purpose.  The Special
Fleets forces are pulled from Named Fleets.  The only exception is Capital,
which keeps 4 numbered fleets as a reaction force or something like that.  The
Big Stick of the Emperor, maybe? (along w/ a couple regiments of the Imperial
Guard).

The "Typical" BatRon from FSotSI has 4 BBs, 3 scouts, 1 tanker, 2 transports
and 2 auxilliaries (auxilliaries being noncombatant resupply/fuel ships in
FSotSI).  The Rider BatRon has 4 BRs.  The Typical CruRon has 5 cruisers.  In
fact, all the typical Imperial squadrons have about 4-5 core ships w/ a larger
number of scouts, escorts, and/or auxiliaries.

It seems your \'examples\' are atypical and on the high end of the scale.

Mmm....it\'s mentioned in several places that the Imperium had gone over
heavily to Battle Riders...  Fighting Ships and Battle Rider both say that
Battle Riders dominated the Imperial Fleet.  Fighting Ships says that due to a
shifting to the Reserve Strategy and precisely because Battle Riders cannot
flee when things go bad, that Battle Riders were concentrated in the
"strategic reserve."  Jump capable ships were used in the "frontier areas."

Nope.  : )   Possibly, if based on your (uncanonical) assumptions. According

I don\'t think so.  It just doesn\'t mesh w/ the historical events.  The
movement was denounced even in the West, though by a minority.  Atrocities
(such as Richard\'s massacre of his captives at Acre) were denounced.  In fact,
the painting I\'ve seen of that massacre (made around the time IIRC) has the
Moslems depicted as martyrs while Richard\'s soldiers villified. It was also a
more brutal age.  Most of the massacres were initiated by the "pragmatic
adventurers on the make."  Notable exceptions like Antioch and Jerusalem can
be explained (though not excused) by madness caused by the ardors, suffering,
pain, and starvation of the long sieges as much as fanatacism.

OB Trav... How does the Imperium c1120 in G:T look back on the Pacification
Campaigns and the Ilelish Revolt?  There doesn\'t appear to be anything in the
way of judgement in the Imperial Encyclopedia or Rebellion...  how do the
citizens interpret the events?  Condemn, applaud or not judge?   And is it
likely the citizens of the areas (Darmine, the League of Antares, citizens of
Ilelish (the world), etc etc) put a different spin on it?

	I hate to reopen the gripefest about DGP products, but what about the
World Builders\' Handbook? If I recall the way somebody explained it once,
while DGP owned the copyright to the actual *text*, the ideas and concepts
were created under license, and hence the license holder (then GDW, now
FFE) had free right to reuse those ideas and concepts. Sure, the text would
have to be rewritten or paraphrased, but the various profiles were
invaluable as a guideline and creativity jogger ...

Ignore, for the moment, the fact that it flew apart
in the spectacular way it did was not due to fate,
destiny, or some inevitable process, but because
it was scripted to be a "Murphy\'s Law" come true:
everything that could go wrong _really did_ go wrong.

I\'d argue that the Imperium became "unglued"
precisely because no one thought it could happen.
In every quarter, "temporary" measures were taken,
but the weight of all of them made them de facto
permanent.

>It was only looking for an excuse to fly apart.  
>That excuse was the lack of the One Clear Choice.

OK, here\'s my take on the Rebellion: The Imperium
was done in by three simultaneous crises -- a
major internal conflict (specifically Dulinor), a
major external conflict (the Solomani), and an
entrenched incompetant on the throne.

The Imperium could -- and HAS -- survive one (the Illelish
Revolts and the whole Solomani conflict; the Frontier
and Rim wars; Cleon the Mad; etc.), or even two simultaneously.
But with all three happening at once, it created
a dynamic which worked against solving any one of them,
and worked towards creating more.

Arguably, the spinning off of the Domains was what was
_supposed_ to happen in the event of the breakdown of
central authority and foreign aggression. Craig and 
Norris saw to their people first, as was their duty. 
Brzk did the same, even though his flirtation with 
the Julian Protectorate was a bit more questionable.
Vland\'s case is a bit fuzzier, but it was still 
ultimately a matter of choosing between duty to
the Emperor versus duty to their Domain, and
not choosing the fool.

Sorry, you lost me here. What "awesomely dynamic and complex 
threads" would those be? And why wouldn\'t they be possible?
TNE (and characters presented within -- even remanats)
always had a hideously oversimplified view of the
Imperium. Gamewise, that\'s understandable. Characterwise,
it was a flaw that no one had a more nuanced view of
what happened, and settingwise, the greatest threat
to the RC was the view that if they were different
from the Imperium in one or two aspects, they were
somehow immune to all the myriad forces that shape
events, including the Collapse. What keeps the RC
together is the "example" of the Imperium and the fact 
that the wilds are howling around them on all sides.
What happens in ten years, when the Wilds have been
pushed back by a comfortable margin and the pressure to
"agree to disagree" is off? And what if they _didn\'t_
have an example to point to?

It\'d be interesting to see if a custom-built tanker could be made to
(quickly!) mine off enough fuel so that a strike force could top off
before a micro-jump (even at J-1 fuel usage) in system. this would
give a TF longer legs, and the ability to escape (even back to the
tanker) if things were to go badly. And since the travel-time for
the data is gonna be far more than a couple weeks (10k plus AU or
so, right?) you can jump the tanker in, mine a couple weeks, refuel
the fleet, have \'em jump in, and even be able to top them on return
if need be.

Obviously the lag is so long as to make it kinda useless unless
somebody is setting up shop out there, anyway. I\'d say it might have 
more usefulness as rock-throwing prophalaxis (man, do I not wanna 
get that going again :-). Finding somebody out there, then doing 
something about it before they leave isn\'t too likely, anyway. 
The idea of backwater systems with pirate bases is kinda neat, 
though. That or a brown dwarf that isn\'t on the normal star charts 
(read: not on the jump routes provided by canon).

_FSSI_ impplies in one place the Colonial Squadrons are payed for by the
Imperium, and just based at worlds that can support them, and in another
place says that worlds that can afford tham can raise jump squadrons that
then count as part of the subsector\'s Colonial Fleet.

OK, what if the BB is jumping in and the Tender and \'riders are the ones in
the inner system - then they\'re in trouble because the BB(s) can wizz on
in, hit the Tender (and whatever else) and roar on by. BTW just how big is
a Tigeress and what TL? What TL is your Tender and \'riders? How about some
of the other CT/HG BB? Your Tender + BRs runs in at 1,400,000 DT, so a it
really should be coompared with, say three 500,000 DT BBs. Also how much
does the whole setup cost?

_FSSI_ has this to say about the composition of BatRons: 

"BatRon: Battle squadrons are created from battleships and are intended to
meet the best of the enemy fleet, engage it, and destroy it. Their purpose
is battle. Battle squadrons are usually reinforced with large numbers of
auxiliary ships, including refueling shuttles, escorts and support
cruisers. In addition, they are accompanied by a number of fleet couriers
which carry commuunications between squadrons."

The organisation diagrams show a typical BatRon as consisting of 4
Battleships, 1 Tanker, 2 Transports, 3 Scouts and 2 Auxiliaries. It shows a
\'rider BatRon as being 1 Tender, 4 Riders, 1 Transport, 2 Scouts and 4
Escorts. While, IMO, these diagrams are probably schematic rather than
exact I can\'t see why they would show 4 BB\'s if there is normally only one.
BTW they also show the flag of a \'rider squadron as being on the tender,
which implies (to me, anyway) that the tender can\'t be too far back from
the action.

FWIW Escorts in _FSSI_ range from 5,000 DT to 20,000 DT, with 10,000 DT
being the norm. Cruisers run at 100,000 DT. Battleships run from the BLs at
200,000 DT to the Dreadnaughts at 700,000 DT, with 300,000 DT being the
standard for a BB.

The copyright is valid. 

Quick rules of thumb for anything written since about 1970 (and it
applies to *most* stuff written before then):

If the copyright is held by a company, it\'s good for *75* years from
when it got printed/copyrighted.

If the copyright is held by an author, it\'s good until the author has
been *dead* for 75 years.

If the copyright is held by more than one author, it\'s good until 75
years after *all* of them are dead.

So the *best* case has the Judges Guild stuff still being copyrighted
until (1975+75 = 2050). 

And even if the company that had the copyright went out of business
*someone* "inherited" the copyright as part of the company\'s assetts. 

So there\'s no point in hoping that copyright has expired on *anything*
that was published for RPGs. You\'ll have to get permission.

The 4 Judge\'s Guild sectors (Ley, Marantha-alkahest, Glimmerdrift
reaches, Crucis Margin) are *not* official. They\'ve been replaced with
sectors where the stars don\'t even match (chech the Imperial Atlas).

First thing. The difference between "heat" and an IR laser beam is that
heat is spread over a *wide* frequency range and the radiation is *not*
coherent. An IR laser has *one* wavelength, and the radiation is
coherent. 

That makes a *big* difference. An IR laser beam, just like any other
laser beam, is *low* entropy. Heat is *high* entropy. Thus, as I said,
you *can\'t* convert raw heat into *any* kind of laser beam. Not without
creating even *more* heat than you started with.

Not even "in theory" can a laser convert heat to IR.

It\'s not a matter of waste heat from the *reactor*. It\'s that all power
generated on the ship *will* wind up as waste heat sooner or later. If
you have a 100 MW power plant, and it is generating the full 100 MW
then your ship *will* be radiating 100MW of energy, mostly as heat. 

The heat is what the power winds up as *after* being used.

Wrong. That means that the crew spaces will be radiating heat at 300 K.
But the problem is that the crew *themselves* plus minimal amounts
of equipment generate *more* heat than is required to keep the ship at
a livable temp. Thus the need to *cool* the ship by using large
radiators.

Just consider the Space Shuttle. It doesn\'t have large power generation
capacity while in orbit. Yet it *has* to open the cargo bay doors to
expose the radiators that *cover* the inner surface, or else it will
*rapidly* become too hot to live in!

Remember, the *only* way energy can leave a spaceship is via radiation.
Which means that *cooling* the ship is a major consideration.

Remember that if they give thrust, they *aren\'t* all that "cold". I\'ve
flown "cold gas" model rockets. The exhaust is a around 270 K (0 C).
Which is still rather visible in the IR in open space.

And the colder the exhaust, the *less* thrust it\'ll give. Meaning that
for the same thrust, you are better off using something that produces
very little exhaust, but has it move *fast*.

Thus for stealth ion thrusters *may* be workable, and mass drivers will
do quite well. Throw away multi-kilo chunks of scrap iron at a few
thousand km/sec, and your ship will move a little, while the chunks of
iron are hard to detect.

I just had this vision of a ship trying to be stealthy and having an
assistant astrogator standing in an airlock pointing a machinegun at
the right star and fire off a few rounds.... It *would* move the ship,
though slowly.

"Charly, that was good. Give me about half as much this time and we\'ll
be right on!"

"Ok, last was a 20 round bust, I\'ll fire 10 this time..."

For legal clarity here (US copyright law anyway):
copyrights only protect particular expressions of original works of authorship.
For our purposes: something somebody created and wrote.

Copyright does not protect ideas at all.  Only patents protect ideas and they are
hard to get.

So, if you use someone else\'s words, without permission, you are infringing
their copyright. (BTW- Paraphrasing is a bad idea.  Use the idea, but create
totally
new language).  Some level of infringement is acceptable.  This is the "fair
use" doctrine.

So, you are mostly correct above.
Use DGP\'s words without their permission, you infringe their copyright.

The confusion comes from Trademark law.  Trademark\'s are source identifiers.
Anything that has "Traveller" on it, in the gaming market, had better be licensed
from Far Future Enterprises, or its in violation.  Trademark problems are
easy when you\'re talking about logos, symbols, names, etc. It gets hard
when you talk about "trade dress".  Trade dress can be a whole lot of
different things.  The shape of a Coke bottle, the windows start up sound,
even the red line and red text on a black cover that we all know and love.

If something about a product is so associated with a product and/or that
product\'s creator, that it functions as a "source identifier", it may qualify
for trademark protection.  An example:  The UWP.  Marc Miller has not
registered this nor asserted that it qualifies for any level of trademark
protection.  Would it qualify for trademark protection?  Maybe.
I could make a good case for it, but its a very close call.

It boils down to a question of confusion to the public and unfairness to the
creator of the original item and the \'goodwill" that has been generated.

Would it be fair to use this or that from a DGP product?

Answer?  Don\'t answer the question!  If there is any question about
the fairness, you don\'t touch it due to legal problems.  You don\'t
want to jury to ever have to deal with it.  Any legal dispute like
this simply isn\'t worth it in the gaming industry by and large.

The issue is complicated here because the DPG stuff necessarily
supplements previous Traveller stuff with a license.  So whether
a particular thing in  DGP product is more GDW or FFE than
DGP is a really confusing question.  However, though confusing,
it is strong support for allowing such things from DGP works
to be used in appropriately licensed Traveller (R) products.

Ok, things are looking up.  But they get brighter!

Trademarks are a "use it or lose it" operation, unlike copyright and
patent which have time limits.  You can\'t get a trademark unless you
use it in commerce.  Likewise, you stop using it, and you _probably_
abandon it after a period of time.

Abandoned Trademarks are gone.  Poof.

From the Lanham Act 15 USC Section 1125 (The Trademark Act):
"Abandonment: A mark shall be deemed to be \'abandoned\' when
either of the following occurs:
     (1) When its use has been discontinued with intent not to resume
such use.  Intent not to resume may be inferred from circumstances.
Nonuse for two consecutive years shall be prima facie evidence of
abandonment. [Note here: that means that whoever abandoned the
mark would have to prove that he really did intend to resume use
of the mark and will have to do so by a preponderance of the
evidence.]  \'Use\' of a mark means the boa fide use of that mark
made in the ordinary course of trade, and not merely to reserve
a right in the mark."

[Bracketed material added; section (2) not relevant - it concerns
generic marks].

So, even if particular items (for lack of a better term) could qualify for
"trade dress" trademark protection (which is doubtful IMHO though
a case can be made depending on the particular thing in question),
they have been abandoned if they haven\'t been used in commerce
(i.e., products sold or bought) in the last two consecutive years.

The 100% legally correct thing to do here is identify the thing you
want to use which could conceiveable qualify for trade dress
protection, then seek a declaratory judgment that any potential
mark has been abandoned.

On top of everything, IMO, its going to be extremely difficult for
any producer of Traveller products (with the exception of GURPS/SJG),
to ever beat Far Future Enterprises in a trademark dispute about
game mechanics because they are going to have to prove in court
that consumers in the relevant market identify their products as
supplement producer first, e.g., DGP, and Traveller second.
For myself, until recently, I never even realized there were different
producers of Traveller products.  Its all about Traveller.  I see
"Traveller" I think 6 2d6 stats, Aslan, Zhos, career chargen, jump
ships, etc.  Not DPG, GDW, Imperium Games, etc.  (Although,
Judge\'s Guild products are so distinctive, you can\'t miss them.
And BITS/CORE has the "Little White Book" going for it.)

At absolute worst, in my mind, if a future Traveller product used
something from a DGP product (excepting direct expressions),
FFE might be required to protect the DGP product author\'s
right of attribution.  But that is easily taken care of by stating
on the copyright page "This work based on mechanics and
game systems developed by Eneri the First."

So if the DPG guy is simply holding out for money, as has been
reported on this list, he\'s doing a bad job of protecting his
rights.  The tighter you grasp a quantity of sand, the more falls out
between your fingers.

As long as you don\'t infringe his copyright, there seems to be a
great deal of lattitude in what you can use from DGP materials.
At least, IMHO.

Very true.  But . . . I would love it if about half to a third of the systems in
a published sector had a Culutural X included. ;-)  Or the paragraph per

Don\'t have the Imperial Atlas or any prospects on ever having.

Thats a shame.  They are licensed 1980 products.
Just when I was thinking of developing the Sydymic Empire in Ley
or staging a Pocket Empire fest in Glimmerdrift.  :-(

Oh well.  Not really much to the JG products but some

Thanks, Shadow, but I just finished law school with a heavy

  They also go right through the primary defense/detection zone, and they
will be going far too fast for gravity to decelerate them much. I doubt
that aerobraking will be practical.

I remember reading in an old JTAS that a microjump uses up enough fuel for a 
Jump 1.  FWIW, that\'s canonical enough for me.  <grin>

  Bearer bonds would be rare due to the potential for various sorts of
security risks - mostly having nothing to do with piracy. More likely
would be instruments transferring funds to a specific account or for 
an individuals use which would be of no use to pirates as such.

Ballard\'s findings (that the BIsmark had rolled over to port, dropped her turrets, 
righted her self and sunk on a relatively even keel) is entirely consistant with 
her being torpedoed in the port side (those fired by HMS Dorsetshire and HMS 
Rodney. Other than that Ballard found that the ships upper works were wrecked 
but her hull was relatively intact to external examination. This is consistant with 
HMS Rodney\'s close range battering and HMS King George V\'s fire penetrating 
her armour deck and bursting below. Ballard was unable to examine the armour 
deck itself. Therefore he was unable to find any evidence of penetration.

>I personally believe that the Bismarck would have sank eventually anyway, but

Apart from the fact that a detailed investigation of Tirptiz post war reveiled that 
the RN had nothing to learn from the Bismark (no way that could have been 
known in 1941). I somehow think it unlikely that even the most gungho British 
officer would have put a boarding party on a battered hulk ablaze from stem to 
stern settling slowly by the bow.

HMS Dorsetshire fired three Mk IX torpedoes into the starboard side and then 
move round and fired another Mk IX into the port side (in itself very telling that 
she was able to do this). Ballard was unable to examine the port side and in 
any case the Mk IX was set to run deep and detonate below the belt. Therefore 
one would not expect to find any damage at the waterline or on the armour belt.

>You might try the National Geographic website...they should have all the info
>on the Bismarck expedition (they funded it)

I\'ve studied Ballards Bismark expedition fairly extensively as well as the other 
evidence *> Ballard appears to have looked at the Bismark seeking to find 
evidence of scuttling. I doubt she was scuttled, there was just no way the order 
could have been transmitted to those poor souls trapped below, through deck 
communications were out (according to Bismark\'s survivors). But even if she 
was it is irrelevant. By the end of the action she was no more than a blazing 
hulk. She was dead in the water, settling by the bow. Her guns had been silent 
for over an hour. To put it bluntly she was sinking; if she was scuttled, then that 
only sunk her faster.

I do not think that the physics involved is TL dependent.  It may be that
we discover some putstanding radiation absorbent material, like various
isotopes of Boron or Carbon, but considereing armour as such, it seems
density is the primary consideration. for Gamma rays.   Who knows is no

  1% is _very_ low - no significant state has been that low since 1940, if
not rather earlier. The US ran 10-15% for much of the `50\'s, for example.
The USSR ran (estimates are very hard to make due to the internal accounts
problems the Sovs themselves faced) 20-25% or so for most of the Brezhnev
era, IIRC, and this was one major factor in their eventual collapse.

  I suspect that this will fall far short of the needed performance envelope.
Let\'s assume that the target has been running at 1-G for an hour or so (d=
65kkm, v= 36 kps). A souped-up Far Trader may have a similar vector, having
taken off intending to intercept, and could follow until it\'s far enough away
to feel safe from intervention* or drops off the indigs lousy sensors.

 *under CT (B:2) this is likely past the planetary 100-d limit.

  OTOH, a 800-ton purpose-built SOTA corsair is _extremely_ unlikely to have
anything like a similar vector (and if it can come in from the other side of
the planet - _through_ its\' core COACC zone - then the pirate leader may as
well thumb through "Space Viking" and decide to land instead); so it follows
just how much "cold" gas is required to significantly alter the course of a
vessel travelling at tens or hundreds of kps in aid of intercepting another
starship doing a similar speed, keeping in mind that the first ship likely
masses 10-20 metric tonnes per displacement ton, and that the ISP of your 
specified thrust agent sucks beyond all rational* belief?

  Modern warplanes seem to have little in common with Trav starships wrt
maintenance requirements. Besides, I\'ve seen seemingly endless discussions
of why warships would be down 50-75% of the time (compared to <2% for civs
using the identical tech), and no mention of just why these new rules
wouldn\'t apply to pirates.

  You\'ll forgive me for pointing out that this is hardly an authoritative
citation?

  So, at maximum sensor range (IIRC?) a single "broadside" will inflict
damage equal to the survival capacity of a ship 2-4 times its\' size? I
shall not bother to address the concept of a sweep conducted with all
weapons crews off-duty.

  If I\'ve been paying attention properly pirates IYTU tend to be large
(400-1000 tons) high-performance (high-G, high end electronics, mil-spec
weapons, Mil-Black hulls).

  At what range do you need to be to reliably disable the drives and weapons
of an armoured target? 

  Just for fun, where do they build them, and who paid for them?

  I know perfectly well where the Oort Cloud is in our system. I never
implied that such a search would be meaningful, or even intentional -
although _eventually_ sensor readings will propagate to remotes left 
there by local SDB elements (or sub-sector/sector forces) simply to
keep an eye on their own refuelling fallbacks (although the distances
will prevent detection of casual use - a base elsewhere would be best).

  In CT maneuver drives didn\'t have cutoffs, and given many months of
fuel it is in practical range for many SDB\'s; Jump vessels could be
used otherwise.

  I meant in the Darwinian sense - there seems to be an assumption

But _ANY_ ship might skip.  The bank is in business to make money.  If
they do not loan to ships that might skip other more lending
tinstitutions will.  The trick is to balance the risks of the loan with
the profit to be made on it.

So banks do not loan to people with good business plans showing their
ship will make money & who will have an exmerchant serving as purser if
the leader of the group happens to be exnavy or exnoble?

How about the following task profile [Which has more modifiers than MT
tasks are supposed to & might better be moddeled as a series of tasks.]

To get a starship morgage:

[This task presupposes that you have already located a specific prebuilt
ship that you wish to buy.  If the ship has to be constructed the task
is +1 Difficulty, or +2 difficulty if you do not have a set of Naval
Architects plans.]

Average, Trader, Soc [possibly CHR if used], 2 hours, safe

[Task duration is expressed in the banks working days which are usually
about 8 hours a day 6 days a week.]

[if world is no law half task duration, if world is high law double task
duration, if world is extreme law quadruple task duration]

[To obtain a bank loan from any given bank is fateful but most non low
pop worlds with Starport type A or B will have multiple banks.]

Modifiers

If applicant is an not an ex Merchant officer, Noble (ie Soc 11+ from
any career), or retired Imperial Naval officer of rank 5+ the task is +1
difficulty.

[Implicit social assumptions the bank makes -  Merchants know what they
are doing, nobles are honorable & usually have money, retired Imperial
Naval Captains & Admirals are gentleman & leaders who are honorable
enough to pay off the morgage & good enough at running ships that the
ship will probably be profitable.]

If the applicant is a retired Merchant of rank 4+ task is -1 difficulty.

If the applicant is an ex rogue, ex Pirate (unless Pirate includes star
mercs in your universe) a further +1 difficulty. 

If applicant is an ex Criminal (TNE career) +2 difficulty

If the applicant is not an Imperial citizen (if in the Imperium) task is
+1 difficulty.

If the applicant is a non human +1 difficulty.

If the applicant is a Vargr  a further +1 difficulty (figure it out).

If the ship is commercially non viable or the charecters have not done a
business plan proving the ship is viable +1 difficulty.

If the ships business plan is to be a mercenary or other high risk role
the task is not more difficult but (if sucessful) will require a
slightly higher intrest rate on the starhip loan as a risk premium.

[Constructing a business plan with false assumptions about prfitability
_proving_ that a non viable design will be viable is an opposed test of
Admin & Int with the bank official (who has -1 difficulty to their task
do to the banks resources.]

If the ship is of a standard merchant design & the design is generally
profitable -1 difficulty. 

If an optional sucessful Carousing task is made with the bank official
- -1 difficulty (Difficulty of this task is at the refs discression
depending on the personality of the loan officer & the banks policies
but Difficult would be a typical difficulty)

If the above Carousing task failed +1 difficulty.

If the down payment is 40% or more of the ships cost -1 difficulty.

If the down payment is less than 20% of the ships cost +1 difficulty for
every 5% short, thus buying a starship with no money down is +4
difficulties (despite this fact Buying a Starship With No Money Down
books are popular).

If the players hire a Broker to deal with the banks loan officer the
task modifiers may use the Brokers skill modifiers.

Bank is owned by a Vilani Corporation +1 Difficulty. (Vilani
conservatism)

It is often a good idea to have a lawyer look at your Starship Morgage
deal before you sign it.  Most Starship Morgages use standardized
paperwork and [in the Imperium] this task is Average, Legal, Edu, 10
minutes, Safe.

You should pop this question to Kenji on the TLDL - he\'s the manic
ethnocultural expert, and I suspect he\'s not monitoring the TML these days.

Personally, I\'m not sure about the usefulness of a Culture extension to the
UWP. "Culture" is a pretty broad term, covering a vast amount of
information, including economics, social relations, language, customs,
norms; it\'s the whole hairy field of cultural anthropology. An extension
could only clarify a very few of the most important aspects.

Some of the Culture Extension codes suggested thus far seem to me almost
uselessly vague, especially "Creativity". How does one measure a culture\'s
"Creativity"? Are some cultures really more creative than others? Every
culture has visual art, crafts, architecture, music, etc. I suppose the
Arts are more highly valued in some cultures than in others, but this
doesn\'t mean the culture is less creative. And how would a planet\'s
"Creativity Code" influence game play?

I favor something like Nancy Parker\'s brilliant article in TD16, a system
for generating and describing a large number of cultural attributes. Her
system covered such attributes as:

        Gender Discrimination
        Social Mobility
        Physical Mobility
        Wealth Distribution
        World View
        Personal Honor
        Honesty
        Emotionalism
        Privacy
        Social Distance
        Modesty
        Value of Human Life
        Value of Other Life

...and so on. I liked most of her system, but felt that it was incomplete.
I added a bunch of ideas of my own, largely cribbed from textbooks on
cultural anthropology.

When anthropologists describe a society, the first things they talk about
are: 1) Lineage System; 2) Food Production Practices. For instance, they
describe the Sarakatsani of Greece as "patrilineal pastoralists", or the
Mundurucu of Brazil as "matrilineal hunter-gatherers". To anyone with any
anthropological training, these two pieces of information instantly tell a
lot about a culture. (Patrilineal cultures tend to be male-dominated,
practice strict monogamy or polygyny, and so on; matrilineal cultures tend
towards egalitarianism, lax sexual restrictions, etc.).

True, most game players don\'t have any anthro training. But I think that a
relatively detailed culture generator/descriptor for Traveller could be an
opportunity to educate people about anthropology, and open their eyes to
the incredible variety of cultures _this_ planet has to offer.

At the very least, a clear and detailed cultural description for a PC\'s
homeworld would provide immeasurable insight into the character, and thus
fuel better role-playing. It will also provide endless adventure kernals
(NPCs trying to escape from arranged marriages, or trying to acquire enough
wealth to pay a steep bride-price, and so on). Further, a diversity of
planetary cultures will stop those annoying claims that Traveller is all
about "Americans in Space." ;]

Along with Parker\'s original system, my modifications include:

Marriage and Family Customs
 Lineage System          - patrilineal, matrilineal, cognatic, bilineal, etc...
 Dominant Marriage Type  - monogamy, polygyny, polyandry... (see below)
 Child Rearing           - by village, both parents, father, mother, etc...
 Marriage Custom         - exogamy, endogamy... also 
 Inheritance             - primogeniture, ultimogeniture, egalitarian...
 Gender Discrimination   - male-dominated, female-dominated, egalitarian...

Economic Structure
 Primary Food Production  - hunting, gathering, agriculture, food synthesis...
 Economic System          - see below
 Special Economy          - see below
 Predominant Social Groups - age sets, moeities, clans, fraternal societies...

Social Structure
 First Colonists          - what kind of people first settled the world
 Subsequent Colonists
 Recent Immigrants
 Age Distribution         - demographic profile
 Oppressed Group          - who\'s on the bottom of the heap?
 Form of Oppression       - what form does the oppression take?

...and so on.

I won\'t post my Culture Generation system here, because it\'s way too long.
Also it contains chunks of Nancy Parker\'s system, and I don\'t want to
violate copyright. And it would mostly make sense only to me; I\'d hate to
have to write explanatory notes for the whole thing (unless of course
someone were to pay me to do so... ;)  

Sorry, folks, I\'m not going to post it on the Web, either, so don\'t even ask!

But I will share a few bits here....

Note that the numbers are NOT intended as UWP-style codes, and things are
arranged in a somewhat arbitrary order, NOT in any kind of progression
(i.e. increasing state control of the economy). Many of the terms are
purely arbitrary, intentionally left vague and undefined.

Economic System         (2D, -4 if TL 5 or less)

0  Generalized reciprocity; mandatory gifting ceremonies.
1  Generalized reciprocity; non-mandatory gifting ceremonies.
2  Decentralized communalism; competing mutual-aid collectives
3  Laisser-faire free-enterprise capitalism
4  Mercantile capitalism.
5  State communism, centralized collectives.
6  State socialism; some private production.
7  Corporate capitalism; dominated by local corporations.
8  Megacorporate capitalism; dominated by offworld corporations.
9  Socio-corporate welfare enterprises.
10 Socio-capitalist welfare state.            [i.e. Canada]
11 Monopolist capitalist cartel state.
12 Social credit capitalist welfare state.

NOTE that this is intended to supplement, not replace, the UWP Government
code. Thus, a Gov-7 Democracy might be communist, or capitalist, or
whatever. Probably a Gov-0 Anarchy should be limited to 0 thru 4 above. I
deal with any conflicts on a case-by-case basis, just as one deals with
bizarre UWP codes.


Special Economy         (D6)

1  Gifting ceremonies on holidays.
2  Economy controled by guilds, unions, or other institutions.
3  Economy controled by clans, kinship groups, or other familial organization.
4  Some class or caste supported by charity (i.e. priests, beggars).
5  Special purpose money (i.e. rare goods, drugs, livestock, shells...).
6  Thriving black markets.


Marriage Type   (2D)

2  No marriage standards (or marriage discouraged).
3  Arranged serial monogamy; limited term marriages. Betrothals rare.
4  Arranged permanent monogamy; divorce illegal. Betrothals common.
5  Chosen permanent monogamy; divorce discouraged or illegal. Some arranged.
6  Chosen permanent monogamy; divorce discouraged but legal. 
7  Chosen serial monogamy; divorce common. 
8  Chosen serial monogamy; limited term marriages; divorce common. 
9  Chosen polygyny; divorce common.
10 Chosen polygamy; any number of males and females per marriage.
11 Arranged polyandry, polygyny, or polygamy; divorce discouraged or illegal.
12 Same sex marriage the norm; heterosexual marriage rare and discouraged.

NOTE: Arranged marriages may be negotiated by parents, grandparents,
religious authorities, matchmakers, or others. Sometimes one of the
participants will have a choice in the matter. "Chosen" marriages are
mostly the decision of the participants, or at least one of them, though
parents often have veto power.

[NOTE that in the real world, polyandry is extremely rare, practiced in
less than 1% of cultures or something. And usually it\'s fraternal
polyandry, where brothers marry the same woman (because they can\'t afford
the bride price individually, or because of a shortage of marriageable
women, or to consolidate land holdings in a small number of heirs).]


Lineage System          (2D)

2  Bilineal or Parallel. Cousin marriage prohibited.
3  Exclusively matrilineal. "Fatherhood" may be an alien concept.
4  Mostly matrilineal.
5  Mostly matrilineal.
6  Cognatic: descent traced through all ancestors.
7  Cognatic: descent traced through all ancestors.
8  Mostly patrilineal, with clan system. Bridewealth may be expected.
9  Mostly patrilineal. Bridewealth or bride-service often expected.
10 Exclusively patrilineal. Bridewealth or bride-service expected.
11 Ambilineal: child (or parent) chooses descent group.
12 Descent lineages not recognized. No inheritance by birth.

[NOTE: I\'ve cut out my various notations regarding kinship-naming systems
and "cross-cousin marriage", which are too obscure to bother with here.
Lineage systems are of prime importance because they determine who you are,
and who can pass on wealth and status to their children. In a purely
matrilineal system, such as a pre-contact aboriginal Australian society,
the concept of "fatherhood" as we know it might not even exist.]

Anyway, if I had to choose a few categories for a UWP Culture Extension, I
would suggest:

        Xenophobia/Intolerance
        Marital Type
        Lineage System
        Food Production Practice
        Economic System
        Wealth Distribution   (as per Parker\'s system)

...and possibly Aggression, or Militarism (although this could be subsumed
into Xenophobia).

Best,

Glenn

  All it takes is a cutter doing a boarding (or even a close pass)
to serve the traffic control/inspection role - which vessels could
be 100-200 times cheaper than a 1000 ton SDB.

  Also, while the pirates talk a big game about using SOTA (and large,
very expensive) ships to sneak about near the targets 100-D limit, I
wonder how they\'ll react to the idea of SDB\'s lying doggo in close
proximity _outside_ the Jump limit? Now that could get nerve-wracking.

  The variant (if cash flow, etc., permits) is to spend that whole
year (or however long) in backwaters or outsystems waiting for a
starship (and getting by on small craft and belters), nailing it
(which may require a _lot_ of follow-up) and then possibly even
spending the year or two that Ian mentioned in sneaking it out of
the state you\'re in to a market where you can get 25-40% for it
and simply retire (probably selling your own ship as well).

  A Kinunir is 80 crew (incl. 35 marines); call it KCr 3.5 each (1 for
gunners, quite possibly less for pongoes) as an average including pensions
(which don\'t apply to those under 20(?) years service, anyway. Bulk it

abstracted upkeep cost. An AHL is 620 (incl. 150 troops), call it maybe
35 MCr for a 40+ (?) BCr(!) ship with an upkeep also in the billions.

  A nice adventure idea, but of no real meaning in the context of explaining

  How do they know which is which without (near-) instantaneous

but even rumour should still be STL unless ship-borne.

Thing is, your average 400 ton pirate boat can toast that 50 ton cutter in a 
heartbeat.  And if the cutter is the only boat within 6 hrs flight time, the 
pirates get away.

The law extension looks too broken down for my tastes ( I use the four I
listed above, based upon 2d6-7+LL). I remeber seeing discussion of this
last year on the list....

I wouldn\'t... creativity is another aspect entirely. There have been some
incredibly art-valuing cultures that were anything but creative (the same
art over and over again), and a very few that value sciences but not the
arts. And of course, some where both are highly valued, but creativity is
suppressed (like most of the communist block did). Altho, creativity would
be a good addition, especially if marc carries forward a separate law
extension.

It often becomes an issue in mine. Usually trying to blow the covers of my
PC\'s, or leading them on wild goose chases, or capturing them at their
absolute worst. In one game I ran, (TNE, last time I ran an RC game, some 5
years ago) one of the PC\'s was a Vargr Journalist (don\'t even start asking
about it... lets just say "Refugee Enclave" and ignore realism of Vargr in
the RC) who also happened to be a spy for the RC Central command, with the
party going on StarViking runs. Between his press releases and his private
reports, the party not only got decorated, but also threatened with
"Intentional Accidents" by high command, and got stuck with Jim-Boy, the
hiver tech-rep and terran historian.

I guess we have come to the point where we have to agree to disagree... I
don\'t think that expecting miracles out of advanced technology is a
\'handwave\'.

There were many earlier this century that thought that the sound barrier
was a law of nature, that the turbulence of transonic speeds would only
increase, and that supersonic flight was therefore impossible.  We learned
otherwise.

Did you ever wonder what someone would think who was monitoring this list

I\'d put this down to an Imperial tradition of late marriage. BTW here in NZ the 
average age for marriage is 26 and first child is 28-29, so I don\'t see that as too 
unusual.

Good point, I hadn\'t noticed that. I\'d suspect that the Emperor married for 
reasons other than love (al la PE). However given the nature of the Imperium, 
not having a "backup heir" or two does seem more than a little unusual.

I think that is a fairly safe bet. Remember IIRC Margaret was able to get her

Exactly my point. The chances of the clone and Iphegina both dying were low, 
but the consequences of it were potentially so huge. And the way to avoid it 
was _so_ simple. All that was need was for Iphegina to be absent for a few 
months (until the real Strephon got back). A quick vaccation to a resort 
somewhere on Sylea would have been more than sufficent. The key thing was 
to make that the Clone and Iphegina could not be taken out (by accident, 
assassination, falling meteor or whatever) at one go.

Now that would be _very_ telling of the state of the Imperium. Here you have 
Tranion, a man who\'s honour and morals are above reproach, the paragon of all 
the Empire values; and this man can not be trusted with the fact that the 
Emperor has to be absent from Capital for a few months on State business. 
Very Very telling indeed!

Great, thats all you need. The Empire is falling apart around you and the 
Emperor crawls into bed and refuses to come out. Yes Strephons wife and 
child have been murdered, but thats the time when the truely great standout 
from the merely mediocre.

Look at the situation of 1116. It is very telling.

You have the 2nd and 3rd in line to the throne allowed to lay about being spoilt 
brats. The smart thing to do would have been to ship them out to the military 
(discipline, responsibility and a modicum of management experience) and find 
them some minor official duties so that if worse come to worse they are not 
_totally_ unprepared. The only reasons for not doing this would be Strephon 
was an incompetant OR the succession was sufficently insecure that he had to 
keep an eye on them.

You have the Emperor removing himself from Capital without telling anyone 
other than his consort or immediate heir. Again this is either incompetance OR 
nobody could be trusted not to make a power grab in his absence.

You have an Emperor who reacts to a crisis by pulling the covers over his head 
and hoping it will all go away.

I believe that Strephon has got a second chance and he knows it. If Imperial 
Intelligence did bump Dulinor off then he would see just how vulnerable the 
situation was OR if somebody else blew up the gig he would see just how 
vulnerable the situation was while he was absent. Either way I think he would 
get to see just how close it was.

But timers were replaced with proximity *because* timers can\'t be set
accurately in advance. To have the timer set properly you have to know
flight time and what ground level at the target is *very* accurately. 

The way to get proximity fuzes that *aren\'t* susceptible to "Shortstop"
would be to use radar units that are multifrequency and that use
"random" pulses. That way you *can\'t* jam them. But it\'d take a while
to get these more advanced units to be cheap.

No Iolanthe is not in line at all. She is Strephon\'s consort. The sucession goes:
  Iphigena
  Varian
  Lucan
  Margaret

All that would be required would have been to find them some relatively minor 
government job (the military would be ideal) and some minor official functions. 
Just enough so that they get some discipline and purpose in life, and to ensure 
that if they ever are dumped into the Iridium Throne they have at least some 
idea of what the job involves. You don\'t have to train them to be Emperor, but 
you can not afford to let them lounge about being spoilt brats. Give them some 
disciple, a sense of duty and some management experience; thats all that was 
needed.

Yes its unlikely, very unlikely even. But the consequences are just so 
potentially disasterous. And the solution is just so simple. Make sure that the 
clone and Iphigena can\'t be taken out (by accident or design) at the same time

I\'d agree that Iolanthe and Iphigena knew. Its an entirely reasonable 
assumption. But that seems to be as far as the knowledge went. Take Tranion. 
A man of impecible honour and morals, an Archduke of the Imperium. And this 
paragon of Imperial virtue can not be trusted with this fact! Something was 
_very_ seriously wrong with the Imperium.

You might check with the IRS. From what I\'ve read on the list and
elsewhere, the IRS has a tax lien against JG\'s owner DBA Judges Guild for a

As a variant of that strategy, it might interest you to know that
the security forces in  Northern  Ireland  have  for  many  years
routinely equiped their vehicles with random signal transmitters.
The idea is that if a terrorist (of either  side)  is  trying  to
place a bomb with a remote control detonator the  random  signals
would cause it to explode prematurely.  If that happened the bomb
may not be at its designated target (or if it were then the wrong
time), and you would also get the bomber.  This  strategy  forced
the bombers to use timers or boobytraps only.

ObTrav: Similar situations are bound to occur on  may  worlds  in
the Traveller universe.  Efate with the Ine Givar  prior  to  the
5FW springs to mind.  The NI example described above was TL7  ...
they may be othe "Shortstop" style devices by TL13 (Efate\'s TL at
the time).

Read the B5 novel about psicorps ("Dark Genesis", I think). It\'s actually
fairly well written, with attention to characterization and such, not just
a \'hack\' job like some of the earlier ones. Should give you some good
ideas and characters to use.

Keep in mind that 10% is not much slack. If it is shaped to be able to take
one class of ship, odds are that many other classes won\'t fit.

This is too vague for my liking. I\'d like some reasonable figures for how
long you have. Are you sure 60 minutes is likely? I\'m not saying they\'re
not -- I just don\'t know. But did you pull them out of a hat or did you
base them on anything?

Just a notion: Wouldn\'t the victims be able to escape in a ship\'s boat by
keeping the ship between them and the pirate?

I\'d say! Weapon hit: -3MCr. Fuel hit: I don\'t know. Drive hit: Megacredits.

In that case one lifeboat lost would have paid for a 400 T patrol vessel
for about 12 years.

This may be true for rootless freetraders, but any established company will
have local representatives with local funds. at the very least they will be
able to get a short-term loan at a local bank. Money carried around in a ship
safe is idle money; it will be kept to a minimum.

FYI the type A2 far trader _Empress Nicholle_ from TWILIGHT\'S PEAK had
Cr40,000 when the adventure started.

OK. Why not count the value of the ship? If it is a business venture, then
you most certanly have to count it. And if it is a stolen ship, why can\'t
he sell that and retire?

No argument there.

Not really. You still have to show that he can expect to catch one Fat
Trader per year.

No you don\'t. The merchant started at the jump limit and you have already
chased it some way inside the limit. You are not going to get outside the
limit anyway. You\'ll have to make an unsafe jump. (I wonder what that does
to your profit margin?) But it does mean that you can stay in the shadow of
your victim until a few minutes before the patrol ship arrives (Note: the
patrol ship will have some topugh choices of its own. Does it go for the
earliest possible shot and overshoot the merchant or does it decellerate to
match vectors?) Unless there are more than one patrol ship coming at you,
that is...

The (fiction only) sources I have for fencing gives you 10% for most stuff,
20% for really movable stuff. I\'d accept your original figures, but I don\'t
think you should increase them.

That\'s accepted. But will you accept in return that the _Nishemani_ would be
taking a suicidal risk if it ever actually landed at any starport large
enough to have a patrol ship hanging around? This means it can\'t eke out it\'s
piracy earnings with a little legitimate trading in between.

If it is a conversion job, then the original hull is still some basic
configuration. If it is purpose-built, then it still can\'t be too strange
a shape or it would not be able to disguise itself.

But that\'s not what we\'re arguing about, is it? We\'re arguing about whether
the underlying assumptions of the OTU have ships worth _enough_ straying
away from patrolled space.

OK. You jump into a system at the jump limit looking and sounding like an
innocent merchant. You spend a few minutes there while system control finds
out you are there, wishes you welcome, and assigns you an approach vector.
You now have the choice of acting like a merchant and hurry on towards the
planet as fast as your maneuver drive will take you or to stay where you
are. If you stay where you are you are acting suspiciously. Now what?

>Jump in-system, to a system that hasn\'t enough patrol craft to stop everyone
>immediately.

Too vague. How many ships arrive every [time period it takes a patrol ship to
inspect a ship] and how many patrol ships are there? How do you make sure you
are not one of the lucky ones that gets inspected right away? Say every fifth
ship is examined (I just grabbed that figure out of my head). You now have
20% chance of getting caught every time you enter a new star system. Bad odds
to beat.

Suspicious behavior. If you are going to somewhere else in the system, why
did you jump to the mainworld in the first place? 

>...or into normal traffic, whatever vectors you nearer other ships and

What makes you think you won\'t be assigned a vector by system control? If
pirates are a concern, then you definitely will. It\'s a cheap, easy way of
making the odds worse for pirates and it also improves traffic safety.

Which assumption are you using, arrival at random point on jump limit shell

How many ships arrive per day at this system? What are the odds that you
will get such a chance? Lot\'s of unspoken (and unwarranted) assumptions
here.

It is? It pulls 1G, you pull perhaps 3G. It will be going towards the
nearest patrol vessel full speed. Is there one stationed in close orbit?
It and the Fat Trader will be closing at 4G. Even if you chase down
your prey and match vectors, you\'re still going inwards at whatever speed
it was pulling when the captain and crew disabled the engines and left in
the ship\'s boat.

If a ship\'s boat or even a rescue ball can\'t keep the crew alive until the
next ship arrives then there\'s something wrong.

A fair start, Walter, but still far too many unspoken assumptions.

The thing about stolen property is that even if no one can prove it is
stolen, you can\'t prove that you got it legitimately. So you get lower
prices for it. That\'s why you get low prices from a fence: Since you can\'t
go elsewhere (except to another fence), he can lowball you.

Not just the Imperium. Starships are much more valuable than cars. It dosen\'t
take the loss of very many ships to justify a private protection effort.

That\'s another problem. The Imperium won\'t need to spend very much of it\'s
budget to button down the entire Imperium. Some of the pro-piracy people
believe that however little it takes, it will always take more than people
will be willing to pay. Maybe that\'s so, though I doubt it. But in absolute
terms the cost will be relatively low.

Why is it common sense to make a reaction roll to see if a pirate is in the
mood to attack you today?

A lost car represents, what, 1 man-year? A lost starship represents thousands
of man-years. There\'s a significant difference.

How many insignificant encounters you have in between dosen\'t alter the fact
that you appear to have about 2.5% chance per jump to run into a pirate. That
works out at 47% risk per year for a free trader (OK, it will be less than
that since even free traders visit Class A and B starports once in a while).

Yes, but starmercs are paid by someone to fight. Pirates have to make their
living by capturing ships.

Round and round we go...

I hardly know where to start. OK, here goes:

The owner of a multi-million credit asset is not just an average joe.

A cargo or two a year per system will not keep a pirate in beans.

The insurance companies _will_ be the ones that bear the cost.

Wrong. When it becomes cheaper to hunt them down than to ignore them, the
private sector will pay for it themselves. Until then they will try to get
the government to do the job (and also after, of course).

A government that can\'t afford the assets to suppress even a particularly
high-profile type of crime, I can readily accept. But I find the notion that
any government that _does_ have sufficient assets would not use them to be
bizarre. Some crimes do become extinct. When was the last time buccaneers
captured and ransomed a Carribean city?

It\'s worse than that. As was pointed out, Tranian knows the dummies exist. If
he is never told that "today Strephon isn\'t here in person", he\'ll know that
Strephon dosen\'t trust him. Heck, there will be times when he will know for

And there is one person it is even more odd wasn\'t informed: Dulinor! D. has

detect the imposture after a few minutes\' talk? Not good. And he has grown
up with the system. He knows that the Emperor can\'t always be there (Come to
that, he must have know that the Strephon he was meeting _could_ be an
imposter. Why didn\'t he wait a few minutes and make sure?). Informing him
ahead of time may miff him a bit, but its nothing to the outrage he\'d feel
if they tried to pull a fast one and he detected it.

Quite frankly, the entire idea of Imperially fixed freight rates is a
stupid, lazy handwave. It is the economics equivalent of completely
ignoring recoil in combat using firearms.

No, it\'s worse. Some weapons dont have appreciable recoil, so I guess you
could ignore recoil at times.

Incidentally, taking this position will mean planetary governments will be
absolutely paranoid about in-system security, because *anything* that
increases risk of loss in the system will be more effective in blockading
that system than a squadron of battlewagons. Why get paid Cr1000 a ton and
take a risk of getting shot when you can get paid Cr1000 a ton somewhere
safe ?

The pro-piracy faction dont want this. You really, really want risk
premiums to apply to freight rates and speculative cargo margins, because
that will encourage traffic to go to objectivly dangerous places. You
should be able to make good money going to dangerous places. Heck, somebody
ask FedEx how much it would cost to send a 100 kilo parcel to Kabul.

If you check the historical records, increased piracy is actually a sign of
*good* times economically. There is no point to standing watch for merchant
ships when there are none, because trade has dried up.

That would be one possible interpretation if it wasn\'t for the fact that
_Rebellion_ also says that fleets range from 50 to 200 ships. With a lower
bound of 50 ships it is kinda difficult to get an average of 31.25...

Not except insofar that I consider it a Bad Thing for a later author to
invalidate previously published material gratuiously (If the change is
deliberate and for a good reason it\'s another matter). So whenever two
pieces of canon contradict each other, I lean towards the original version.
That often happens to be the CT. But other than that I believe that all
Traveller material is equally canonical.

Gary, even if _Rebellion_ didn\'t say that fleets range in size between 50 and
200 ships, your interpretation would merely be equally reasonable. Do try to
restrain your defensive instincts.

That\'s what one part of the text says. But the one Named Fleet they actually
describe is "The Corridor Fleet" and none of the four fleets named is the
same as any of the 16 regular fleets shown for Corridor on the map. So the
one example of a named fleet we have is NOT an umbrella organisation. As I
said, the evidence is conflicting.

Could be. But to stick to my abovementioned principle, I\'d prefer an 
explanation that validated both sets of information. Maybe the typical
BatRon for the Rebellion era is just smaller than the typical BatRon from
the previous era, the one that _Fighting Ships_ detail? 4 BBs, you say? That
could be an 8 BB squadron that had been split in two or reduced by combat
losses. What is the in-game date of _FSSI_? Long enough into the Rebellion
for combat losses to have affected the composition of the typical squadron?

Really? And here I thought that we had had a long discussion where you
argued that the Imperial peacetime navy wouldn\'t have a huge reserve,
because a huge reserve would provide Norris with scores of extra fleets
once they became reactivated. Was I mistaken? You actually believe that
the Imperial Navy propably have huge numbers of ships laid up and that
that is the reason the peacetime navy is so comparatively small?

This is a totally unwarranted assumption. Nowhere in the rules do I find
any support for the idea that the colonial fleets and the system defense
forces are not trained to the same standard as the regular navy. On the
contrary, the character generation implies (I put it no higher than that,
the CGR being a tricky thing to draw evidence from) that there is no
difference at all.

That may be a reasonable way to do it, but _FS_ specifically mentions that
some _BatRons_ are split up and placed in different systems during peacetime.
It may or may not be a silly thing to do (I don\'t care to argue that), but it
definitely is the way the IN does it.

It\'s not the number of power plants, it\'s the total size of them. A legitimate
merchant is less competetive if his ship is filled up with unnecessary extras.
So if your maneuver drive is too big or you have PA barbettes installed, the
inquiring security captain will want to know how you plan to turn a profit.

What then DO you consider a handwave? Traveller is (the only besides
T2300?) SF RPG that tries to be hard SF ie the physics has to be explained,
either with real world physics or invented physics but at least some
physics that more or less has to be described and then we live with the
consequences. (like those darn near-c rocks, ooops ;-)

About your example about soundspeed I\'m afraid you\'re a bit wrong there.
According to aerodynamics theory at the time it would require infinite
energy to cross the soundbarrier which was a bit perplexing to the
engineers as they KNEW that bullets, grenades and later even V2 rockets etc
were able to break the speed of sound. They knew their theory was wrong
just as our scientists KNOW that something is fishy with quantum mechanics
and/or general relativity as the two theories are incompatible.

Well a radio transmitter strong enough to fool the stupid short range

IIRC, each member world elected a sitting representative that met in a

I was under the impression that the ECM program for starship computers was supposed to do that very function.  I\'m refering to the LBB 2, of course...

I\'ll bet the CT ECM program only works to blow up missiles that are

Shortstop may have the same limitation - don\'t proximity fused rounds
have to arm themselves in flight before the fuse can set them off?
Otherwise, the round would go off in the mortar tube all by itself.

I didn\'t think so...most of the freighters in TTA, even ones this big, had
at most a turret or two and no armor. They may have had more hardpoints
fitted, but no weapons on them - perhaps they were prepared to be

better, as HG had a computer capability related to size as well as jump

advantage, as well as the desperation benefit - the pirates are
desperate men, the freighter crew (on a ship this size) may not
be as dedicated - it\'s not like they own it or anything.

No, but it does say _some_ escorts, indicating that not all escorts are
included and it also says that it does not include auxiliaries, support
ships, and scouts. The most reasonable interpretation of this seems to
me to be that small ecsorts are considered auxiliaries and only big escorts
are considered combat vessels.

How about a few quotes and an in-depth analysis of them? So far you haven\'t

guesses and "feelings".

Sorry. I meant the \'coast guards\', not the auxiliaries.

No, it is _called_ a "Frontier Cruiser". A real cruiser has a spinal mount
(Quick, somebody, I\'m sure I\'ve seen that definition somewhere, but I can\'t
recall the reference. Am I wrong here?).

As Traveller Gary wrote, the Atlantic Class cruiser ran to around 800.

Cop-out. There may not be enough to prove anything (though the information
various kind people have provided from FSSI will give me some happy hours
trying. Thanks, friends), but that shouldn\'t keep you from coming up with
something that you think is reasonable. You certainly have firm enough
opinions about what _isn\'t_ reasonable. Why don\'t you put a few hours work
where your mouth is. I\'m tired of getting nothing but vague "feelings" for
arguments.

Try basing it on your knowledge of the Traveller ship-building and combat
rules. That\'d be a lot more germane.

It is not possible that this would not be the case. If it cost more to
service a ship, annual maintenance would cost more.

What dock? These are space ships, not surface ships. They don\'t need a dock
to support them while they have the barnacles scraped off.

But it makes sense to you that a shipyard would charge less than their own
costs to perform an overhaul?

A lot of it was conducted by e-mail. Basically I believe that if the Domain
of Deneb have a huge number of ships laid up in ordinary, then Norris will
get enough reinforcements to secure the borders against the Zhodani (who are
not activating their reserves) in time to kick the Vargr and the Aslans out
of the Domain far faster than canon says he did. Gary disagrees with me on a
number of counts. IIRC 1) The reserves aren\'t that big. 2) They can\'t be
activated that fast. 3) They will all be needed at the Zhodani border,
because the possibility that the Zhos may invade is much more serious than
the killing, robbing, enslavement, and land-grabbing that the Vargr and the
Aslans are actually performing at the same time. 4) The Aslans can provide
enough strength to outfight anything Norris can afford to send against them.
Am I forgetting anything or misrepresenting you in any way, Gary?

Not if you armed the sub with a big meson gun. This has been proposed
before; with _mobile_ deep meson sites roving about the ocean, you can
put planetary defense into a whole new ballpark.

Simple. At the appropriate time - say, when the interceptor has moved

Anti-pirate techniques - How about a weapon( missile? ) emplacement
behind the airlock that will bypass the outer hull when the pirates
board?

This has been suggested by 1 of my players and I can\'t think of any
problems with it.  The airlock will be a 90 deg for normal access.  With
the thinner inner walls, most of the interior will be demolished and the
explosion will break the connection between the 2 ships before it kills
the firer.

So, for a trashed airlock, you get a dead pirate.  Has anybody heard of
this before and can anybody think of any down sides/problems?

And to me. I used that to argue that this was indeed the case. I thought that
Gary disagreed with me, but he has just stated that he has no problem with
huge reserve fleets. I wonder what all the arguing was about, then...

The thing is, Charles, that the merchant will be carrying two or three snub

him, since he can shoot them to pieces while they approach.

Would you care to explain how they managed to time their approach to

I don\'t understand your reasoning at all. My interplanetary navigation skills
are weak, but I believe that getting from any spot on the 100 diameter limit
to any spot on the planet will take almost the same time. Can anyone who
actually know anything about this help us out?

This is the last time I\'m going to mention the variation in jump time. You
can maintain a scedule for outbound ships at the expense of losing about a
day per jump (which comes to several jumps per year, which is why I don\'t
think it would be used), but there\'s no way you can time an arrival closer
than plus/minus a day or so.

Me, I\'d talk about morale problems instead. There are ways to deal with those

it takes several ships to keep one ship permanently on station, I\'m
perfectly agreeable.

Marc certainly has the authority to decide once and for all when the _Maghiz_

accept any of the three. But if he were to tell me that it took place on all

This is too vague for my liking. I\'d like some reasonable figures for how
long you have. Are you sure 60 minutes is likely? I\'m not saying they\'re
not -- I just don\'t know. But did you pull them out of a hat or did you
base them on anything?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'ve pulled them completely out of my hat. I\'m trying to give a low
estimate of plunder time, something between thirty and ninety
minutes. If the pirate doesn\'t think he can get at least that much
time, he\'ll pass. If he can get more, he may be able to get more
cargo, ship components and such and have to hit fewer ships.

When my toddlers are a little bigger I\'ll pull out my Mayday game
and see how much time some different patrol scenarios would give you.

They probably could. Since a 20tn lifeboat is 1G and worth more than
what can quickly be stripped from a starship, the corsair may
go after the launch instead. This could be dangerous for the crew
packed away in low berths on the lifeboat.

Here\'s an idea for a starship crew - eject the lifeboat (empty) along
a different vector, make the pirate choose between boarding your
starship (and threatening your passengers) and getting his mitts on
the launch. Getting both launch and starship may take longer than
the incoming patrol vessels will allow. Now the pirate never has to 
find out about the MCr10 lot of radioactives in your cargo bay.

In that case one lifeboat lost would have paid for a 400 T patrol vessel

The lost wages of people murdered in the US every year would pay for

Crime losses do not transfer directly into crime prevention budgets.
Regardless, the pirates will not hang out as much in systems that
can afford to pay for more patrol craft.

This may be true for rootless freetraders, but any established company will
have local representatives with local funds. at the very least they will be
able to get a short-term loan at a local bank. Money carried around in a ship
safe is idle money; it will be kept to a minimum.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I think there\'s some evidence that "established companies" won\'t have
as many ships along routes where a pirate has a chance. Regardless,
there will be some cash on board. We have it as canon that Imperial
Military are paid in cash, as per long tradition - what if a similar 
tradition applies to merchant enlisted crew?

OK. Why not count the value of the ship? If it is a business venture, then
you most certanly have to count it. And if it is a stolen ship, why can\'t
he sell that and retire?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I think there are enough situations where an ethically-challenged captain
has a ship that is easier to use than it is to sell. My analysis was
based on keeping the ship running, the pirate will not have bank
payments to make on a regular basis. I also think my analysis shows
that there is enough profit, at least on an irregular basis, to pay for
the ship as well - if you survive.

Not really. You still have to show that he can expect to catch one Fat
Trader per year.

To break even, you only need to take one every three years. If there
aren\'t enough cracks in the local patrol nets for a pirate to take 
a ship a year, your area is very well patrolled and should have no
piracy problems at all.

We don\'t need to discuss surviving as a pirate in the Imperial Core,
or in high-pop Class A starport systems - we need to find the regions
where there is enough traffic, but not yet enough patrols for a pirate
to prosper.

Hans again:

That\'s accepted. But will you accept in return that the _Nishemani_ would be
taking a suicidal risk if it ever actually landed at any starport large
enough to have a patrol ship hanging around? This means it can\'t eke out it\'s

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
None of my analyses included legitimate trading by the corsair, just
for this reason. If you do get into a situation where you could do
such trading, it\'s most immediate effect would be to boost your
return on stolen craft, vehicles and cargo above the figures I guessed at.

Hans again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
OK. You jump into a system at the jump limit looking and sounding like an
innocent merchant. You spend a few minutes there while system control finds
out you are there, wishes you welcome, and assigns you an approach vector.
You now have the choice of acting like a merchant and hurry on towards the
planet as fast as your maneuver drive will take you or to stay where you
are. If you stay where you are you are acting suspiciously. Now what?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Remember that you\'ll be "hurrying towards the planet" at a whopping
one G acceleration - you\'re pretending to be an average merchant.
You keep your three to four G capability under wraps until you\'ve
selected a target, or determined that the system is too tight for you
to play in.

I\'m going to the star\'s 100D for most incoming traffic, rather than the
main world, because I like what it does to populating the rest of the
star system. 100D of whatever you\'re leaving for jump entry I think
I\'ll keep.

Hans again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Too vague. How many ships arrive every [time period it takes a patrol ship to
inspect a ship] and how many patrol ships are there? How do you make sure you are not one of the lucky ones that gets inspected right away? Say 
every fifth ship is examined (I just grabbed that figure out of my head). You 
now have 20% chance of getting caught every time you enter a new star 
system. Bad odds to beat.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Deliberately vague. I don\'t have the figures, or any way I can think of
to know these for every star system in the Imperium. The "anatomy of
a strike" I presented assumed a system where traffic was at a level
higher than the current patrol capabilities could efficiently handle.
Look at the build time for a 400tn patrol cruiser/SDB - if something
has happened to increase trade, or something bad happened to a
significant fraction of the local patrol force, it could be a while until
force availability is sufficent again.

What makes you think you won\'t be assigned a vector by system control? If
pirates are a concern, then you definitely will. It\'s a cheap, easy way of
making the odds worse for pirates and it also improves traffic safety.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
You\'ll be assigned a vector by system control, but it\'s up to you
what destination you want to ask for.  And as I mentioned to another
responder, traffic control will space ships based on starport handling
capacity and the capabilties of 1G merchants, they won\'t space them
based on any one of them possibly being a 4G pirate that has to be kept
from intercepting any other ship.

Enough will arrive to make it worth your while to hunt here, or you won\'t 
take the risk and will hunt elsewhere. The odds that you will get the

your hunting grounds on this basis. You seem to want me to present
you with an analysis for each individual system in known space, and
call my assumptions unwarranted because I don\'t see how to do that.

The ship\'s boat can take the crew all the way to safety on it\'s own.
The ship\'s boat is also the biggest easily available prize, that pirate
will want to keep it - and will be tempted to do uncomfortable things
to the crew that goes against his desires and tries to make off with it.

A rescue ball, IMO, isn\'t designed for long duration use. Leaving 
people in them in open space while chasing a pirate might be
akin to leaving life-jacketed people in the water while the Coast
Guard cutter chases the pirates - the cutter won\'t do it, not at least
without sending a boat or helicopter to the rescue.

you take too long, or place the pirate too far inside the interception
envelope of system patrol? Does the pirate captain have a superstition

Most likely there wouldn\'t be a wet navy at TL 12+ since Antigrav Vehicles
become commonplace at these levels of technology, so it\'s not neccessairy
anymore to build vehicles for a special type of environment (air, water,
ground).  If i remember correctly there was some discussion about this in
the megatraveller refeeres companion.

If the world is not balkanized i would say that there aren\'t many ground

The Sloan actually is just barely that kind of escort, at the low end (the
EM-15, I believe, is pretty close to a Sloan in design).  It\'d be more
accurate to say that a Valor missile corvette is that kind of escort in
the same way the Kinunir is a cruiser.  FSSI suggests that 5000 tons is
about as small as the Fleet Escorts go.

I\'d say the numbers are reasonable.  The Kinunir isn\'t a great example, as
it\'s too early in Traveller development, but is easy enough to retcon.  For
one thing, supposedly they only built twenty of them.  For another, they
had, as David Pulver said, "that puzzling little factor-1 black globe
generator".  It could make the Kinunir useful as a light escort for forces
that are all black globe equipped.  They\'re 4FW-vintage ships, so they were
getting black globes (and defective General Products computers) at the same 
time as the Lightnings.

The Atlantics are interesting.  As I recall, they\'re jump-4 5G heavy cruisers 
of about 75000 tons built at early tech-15 (1020s), and look like a flattened
Azhanti without the gooseneck.  J4-5G makes them BatRon companions, and the
low maneuver supposedly was getting them shifted out of first-line use in
favor of newer J4-6G designs.  By comparison, the Azhantis are specialized,
late tech-14 (990s) jump-5 2G fleet intruders of 60000 tons that came into
service just as tech-15 designs rapidly started appearing.  

At about 20 sectors, that\'d be only five Lightnings and forty Atlantics per
sector if spread evenly at their peak numbers.  (They weren\'t spread evenly
of course; for instance, most of the Lightnings saw service in the Solomani
Rim War, and the few remnants left after that and the 4FW-era CF conversion
were assigned to the Marches, Core, troubled Gateway domain, and the Rim.)

Given the number of cruiser classes in Imperial service and given about 
1000 major combatants per sector including heavy escorts, I\'d say that\'s a 
reasonable number of those particular ships.

The City-State of the Invinicble Overlord went to Mayfair Games and then
from there to TSR. I think Mayfair bought all the Judges Guild copyrights.
TSR then sued and settled with Mayfair and all the judges guild AD&D
copyrights went to TSR.

This was suggested in an issue of White Dwarf many moons ago - Certainly

Current wet navies do the former now - when a ship docks for

Good ones, yes - typically an acceleration or velocity arming mechanism.
Today, these are mechanical devices. But what if some TL13 smart alec
uses an electronic safety as well as an electronic fuse - i.e. a line of
code in the missile\'s controller says:

ARM_MISSILE when VELOCITY > 1000 km/h

If this is the way it\'s being done, you can attack the controller. Being
a higher tech level helps.

Hm...to be honest, _why_ should ships have black hulls?  There\'s actually an
argument for a white (or off-white) hull -- something with a reflected spectrum
reasonably close to random garbage which might be spotted in a system.  There
are very few hot objects within your average solar system, while there are
probably many cool moderately reflective ones.

Hans, if it will get it into your IMTU, I\'ll heartily support changing the

"Piracy only exists in the the vacuum of government/corporate morals, or as

I assume that you are responding to my post - I think that I\'m the only one
who mentioned the Bismarck. So just to recap I wrote:

>Bismarck May 1941 *Crippled by air attack, then finished off by battleships*

Which, if you read ever so closely, you may notice *doesn\'t say that the
Bismarck was destroyed by planes*.

However - attacks by Swordfish torpedo bombers from HMS Victorious on the
night of 24/25 May and damage from the 14" guns on the Prince of Wales
caused sufficient damage for the Bismarck to turn for Brest. On 26 May a
Swordfish from the Ark Royal torpedoed the Bismarck and jammed her
steering. She was then sunk by the Britsh Home Fleet using torpedoes and
guns.

I have never seen anything on her being scuttled, but even if she was, it
only advanced the inevitable. And, in my mind, if the RN posed such a
threat (and had inflicted substantial enough damage) to lead the Captain of
the Bismarck to scuttle her, the RN had achieved a mission kill - the
Bismarck had accepted that it could not win or escape the engagement. All
of which is interesting, however, with respect to my original post....

...the point is that the aircraft attacks were critical in obtaining the
kill, as was the aircraft spotter who relocated the Bismarck after 32 hours
of lost contact.

I and a few players had an interesting idea last night.  I do not know if
this had been mentioned on the list before.
We came up with the possibility of "Star Gypsies" in Traveller.

Imagine a constantly roaming people who basically live by jumping system
to system, setting up shop on the mainworld until they work out the debt
they owe the starport, or find whatever materials they need to keep their
ships functioning, or until the locals get tired of them and kick them off
the planet, only to head out to the next system to do the same thing.

Now I understand that starships are expensive business, therefore I am
assuming the star-gypsies will prolly have "Family" ships that are
centuries if not millennia old.  We can say that some of the Star-Gypsies
are actually descendants of merchants who basically continued to ply the
space lanes even after the fall of the RoM (Hmmm... Rule of Man acronyms
to "RoM", interesting <G>)  Star-Gypsy ships must take engineering into
almost religious levels, the ship is their life!  Part of what the gypsies
do is search every square hectare on the planet they happen to be on for
replacement parts to keep the ship running, they should be excellent
scroungers.  While on the world, some families provide entertainment
services.  Travelling gypsy shows are very popular on those worlds which
tolerate them.

But since Star-gypsies have a reputation for "taking anything that is not
nailed down, and taking a crowbar to that which is" Imperial Society
regards them as little more than tramps and thieves.   Therefore a Star
Gypsy will never have higher than average social class and (for GT) social
stigma almost on par with that of psions or cyborgs.  Some worlds regard
them as worse than psions for part of a gypsy show is a "magic" or
"fortune telling" act.  Some psionophobic societies think this really IS
psionics. (Tramps, thieves, and psionic?  KILL THEM!)
The Star-Gypsies will tell you it\'s all an act, or is it? ;-)

The fact of the matter is that yes, Star-Gypsies do have the knowledge of
psionics, and it is a closely guarded secret.  It has been so even BEFORE
the psionic suppressions.  If you think a Star-Gypsy caravan may be a good
place to look for psi training, think again.  They would quicker trick you
and leave you robbed and naked then tell any of their family secrets to a
"gadje".  Unless....you prove yourself otherwise and join up with them.

This could provide beucoodles of adventure hooks!

  A digital timer would be a solution; it would be simpler to work with
and much cheaper than earlier mechanical timers. Further, improvements
elsewhere - mostly in mapping, GPS and ease of calculating precise fire
orders (and partly ballistic) - would make accurately allowing for topography
much easier.

  Good point - of course if you don\'t have the money for an SDB to be on
call (evidently your point) then how could you have even inspected the
ship in the first place, as that inspecting ship would not have existed?
OC, the pirate can\'t _know_ that no SDB is within response range, unless

Pretending-to-be-an-asteroid is an interesting approach to hiding, but my 
feeling is that it generally won\'t work; 30-m asteroids are rare enough that
it\'s fairly practical for a ship to scan every one it sees with LIDAR, 
measure its range and velocity (any spaceship that isn\'t deliberately lurking
will be moving faster than local orbital velocity) and maybe its shape. 
It\'s more the sort of thing you would try under specialized circumstances...
it works better for defenders than attackers, too, because defenders will 
probably have the whole solar system charted down to 100-m or maybe even 
30-m sized objects. (I thought about adding a rule reducing sensitivity of 
all sensors by -0.5 for the first two days in a new system, to represent the
period during which a ship is learning which blobs are asteroids...) 

I think (though I could be argued out of it) that MilBlack coatings are stil
capable of changing colour, so you could always set your hull coating to
"asteroid red"...although what you probably really want is to have it a
very very very dark red (so that you look (when unresolved) like a *small*
asteroid.)

    'body' => '     Here is my take on the the sizes and makeup of the Imperial Fleet.  I
have used the following sources for this:

1) Supplement 9:  Fighting Ships
2) Adventure 1: The Kinunir
3) Azhanti High Lightning

Non-canonical sources:
1)  The Honor Harrington novels
2)  The Hornblower novels

     The Imperial Navy is formed to protect the sovreignity of Imperial Space.
It consists of  small, very high-tech forces, supplemented by much larger
reserve and colonial forces forward deployed, while the TL15 Navy forces are
held back to react to threats as they develop.

Fighting Ships (Supp 9) gives some specific numbers for types of ships and the
number of ships on deployment:

DD (Midu Agashaam)  Limited Production (deployed in over-size squadrons of 25
for evaluation)
CE (Gazelle)  "Hundreds"
CC (Kinunir) 20 built, deployed either individually or in pairs
CF (Lightning) 133 built
CR (Atlantic) 794

All of these ships seem to be set w/in the Spinward Marches...only in the case
of the CE and the CR are they specifically mentioned as being used Imperial-
wide.

Squadron sizes:
     I reject a lot of the info presented in FSSI...it amazes me that no one
seems to have noticed the glaring errors that puts it right up there w/ most
IG products.  This was probably the worst product GDW put out for any Trav
incarnation.

     There are specific references to the size of a BatRon in Fighting Ships:
Both the Tigress and the Kokirrak-class DN are listed as having a Batron size
of 8 DN\'s.  So here is what I use IMTU...YMMV:

Squadron (CruRon, BatRon):  8 ships
Squadron (DesRon): 8-16 ships
Division (CruDiv, BatDiv): 2 ships
Division (DesDiv) 4 ships
Detachments (CruDet, BatDet, DesDet) 1-2 vessels

Task Group:  At least one CruDiv, one DesDiv.  More assigned as needed by the
Group.
Task Force:  Usually 2 or more Task Groups, almost always w/ BatRon present.
Auxiliaries attached to Groups or Forces as needed (Tankers, resupply ships,
repair ships, hospital ships [rarely] and Carriers)

During times of peace, BatRons are usually deployed among the sector in
BatDivs at key naval bases (called "stations" for that good old Royal Navy
feel <G>)  Batrons are rarely broken down into detachments, except for
specific missions.  CruRons are routinely broken down into divisions and spend
a fair amount of time on detachments as well ("showing the flag")  DesRons are
used much like CruRons.

     In wartime, the CruRons are usually operated together unless needed for
specific purposes (like commerce raiding) then they operate in divisions,
usually w/ either a Desron or DesDiv in support.  BatRons MAY be committed to
battle in divisions, but only if there is no other choice due to the tactical
or strategic situation.  They will always have at least an attached DesRon,
and usually more than one (If operating as a Task Group).  A CruRon will
generally be present as well.

     I will post some of my TU assumptions on construction of the fleets in a
later post.  Meanwhile, please let me know what you think of the above
ideas/assumptions!  :-)

  FWIW, there is a mechanism in FFW relating the difference in degree
of effectiveness between Zho & Impy regular/colonial squadrons, but it
almost certainly refers primarily to TL differences. IAC, the cruise to
the front would likely be 7/24 drills for activated reservists...

From: William Prankard <cmdrx@magicnet.net>
Subject: Star-Gypsies

Greetings!

I and a few players had an interesting idea last night.  I do not know if
this had been mentioned on the list before.
We came up with the possibility of "Star Gypsies" in Traveller.

Imagine a constantly roaming people who basically live by jumping system
to system, setting up shop on the mainworld until they work out the debt
they owe the starport, or find whatever materials they need to keep their
ships functioning, or until the locals get tired of them and kick them off
the planet, only to head out to the next system to do the same thing.

Now I understand that starships are expensive business, therefore I am
assuming the star-gypsies will prolly have "Family" ships that are
centuries if not millennia old.  We can say that some of the Star-Gypsies
are actually descendants of merchants who basically continued to ply the
space lanes even after the fall of the RoM (Hmmm... Rule of Man acronyms
to "RoM", interesting <G>)  Star-Gypsy ships must take engineering into
almost religious levels, the ship is their life!  Part of what the gypsies
do is search every square hectare on the planet they happen to be on for
replacement parts to keep the ship running, they should be excellent
scroungers.  While on the world, some families provide entertainment
services.  Travelling gypsy shows are very popular on those worlds which
tolerate them.

But since Star-gypsies have a reputation for "taking anything that is not
nailed down, and taking a crowbar to that which is" Imperial Society
regards them as little more than tramps and thieves.   Therefore a Star
Gypsy will never have higher than average social class and (for GT) social
stigma almost on par with that of psions or cyborgs.  Some worlds regard
them as worse than psions for part of a gypsy show is a "magic" or
"fortune telling" act.  Some psionophobic societies think this really IS
psionics. (Tramps, thieves, and psionic?  KILL THEM!)
The Star-Gypsies will tell you it\'s all an act, or is it? ;-)

The fact of the matter is that yes, Star-Gypsies do have the knowledge of
psionics, and it is a closely guarded secret.  It has been so even BEFORE
the psionic suppressions.  If you think a Star-Gypsy caravan may be a good
place to look for psi training, think again.  They would quicker trick you
and leave you robbed and naked then tell any of their family secrets to a
"gadje".  Unless....you prove yourself otherwise and join up with them.
;-)


This could provide beucoodles of adventure hooks!

Awaiting comments.

The pirate won\'t _know_ there isn\'t an SDB lurking within response

able to detect an intercepting SDB before it closes to effective attack

Cutters would make a nice force multiplier for local forces, though.
One combat-strong ship acting as a base for two to four inspection
cutters, if a cutter gets into trouble the ship intercepts - and the ship
won\'t be as easily pulled off station by inspections, boardings or
(possibly faked) emergencies.

That pirate trick I mentioned about releasing rescue balls, then
zooming off on a different heading - if the patrol ship had an
associated cutter, the cutter could do the rescue while the ship
continued pursuit.

The standard 400tn Patrol Cruiser carries a Ship\'s Boat (30 tn, 6G,
pretty good passenger accomodations) - pretty handy to have available
if you are performing commerce patrol.

The ort clould is .5 to 1 LY out from the primary and you expect to see a
ship at that range?  Just how big is that array?  You have to have a curtain
amount of surface area to resolve targets that size at that range.  And how
are you going to pick it out from the million of bodies out there as well as
scan a shell that size with that precission?  And how much does this cost?

That\'s why you run in cold and choose your velocity so that after your
gravity braking you can quickly match velocity with the outgoing trafic.
The merchant is accelerating out, you are moving faster but are behind him.
The velocity formulas for the accel out and decel in are known so not a
problem.  You\'ll have two limited windows to strike.  One on the way in to
catch a just emerged merchant and one on the way out to catch an outgoing
one.  The first reqires greater breaking but with a slight course change in
nearly any direction will put you out the 100 dia. limit in minutes after
you dock with the target.  A touch of cold gas manuvering and a gravity well
and you can hit any spot on the 100 dia. shell you want on the way out and
you are already moving more than the final velocity of an exiting ship so
that SDB is not going to catch you before it\'s to late.  Remember \'free
return orbits\'?  If your course only needs a small change you don\'t even
have to get to close to the planet.

For those travelling years away from home negotiable currence is everything.
A check would take years to clear even a cashers check.  Real value must be
carried or you risk loosing what backs that note.  Even bearer bond and
stock can become worthless in 2 years time if the issueing agency goes toes
up.  There would have to be a discount involve for trader to buy stock in
distant places.  A core stock might be worth 50% in the marches unless is
was for Imperial lines that operated in both.  This could make life very
interesting to a booty oriented pirate or travelling PC.  Maybe a system of
value changes like thoses used in GURPS Cyberworld would be in order with
hard IMP creds being on par and all others fluctuating bases on percived
stability.

Not in this context.  It means the difference in relative velocity.
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity and the the intergal of
velocity while velocity is the direvative of accelration.

Delta has more than one use/meaning just like derivative.

Derivative is a calcus function but it also means derived from or desended
from as in a derivative work.

With jump drives the change \'Delta\' of relative velocities between origin
and destination can be very high.  Delta is often use to show that the
velocity in question is highly relative to some perhaps arbitrary object.  A
ship can simultaniously have many different delta Vs, one with the planet,
another with the sun, another this a merchant ship, and another with a SDB,
all constantly changing in different ways.  Each would be expressed as a
velocity relative to one of the above at any given moment in time.  They are
generally denoted with subscipts or bracket titles.

Dv(SDB)=120mps

For example while relative acceleration would be. 

Dv(SDB)=60mps^2  or 60 meter per second accerleration.

That is why falling accel is expressed 32 fps^2.

This is of course only one of several forms of notation.  Use the one you
are most comforable with

Use H2 at 2k and throw 100 kilos out at 100 mps if you think the sesor aray

Please define 20-sigma.  Signal strength deference is not relevent if the
signal is not more than 2x noise level.  It\'s a quantum physics issue.  If
the viewing angle aproached that of one photon on the surface of the sensor
the obtect is not detectable by any means due to both quantum mechanics and
the uncurtinty principle.

>
>Bruce

If the radiant energy from the scout that reaches the sensor drops below the
background noise level it will be undetectable regardless of any other
concurn.  You are egnoring that there are quantum limits on ampification and
discrimination.  With infinite amplification, no noise threshold, and no
quantum energy threshold you are correct.  Signals at 1ev or one photon are
not recoverable.  They carry on inteligable information as they are single
state quantum units.  The noise level is much higher than that.

Space is not at 0k.  I think that if I recall properly it is in the single
digits (2k maybe) but it varies some from place to place.  Not my field but
I do remember hearing it quoted in the past somewhere.  99.9 black at 300k
is 3k effective and that 300k can be reduced by technological means I\'ve
discuss in other posts to much less than 300k.  How do you think thermos
bottles work?

I disagree with you if we are talking about having archives available. 
If you remove the "way we\'ve always done things" and let some archives
survive, then there could be new ways of doing things....the oddball
experiment that works out and moves things in a radically different
direction.  That\'s how I\'d play it anyway...  Some areas of higher tech,
some lagging.  But 850 years is a long time.  Yeah there\'d be some fear
of tech, but the Solomani would forget quicker than the Vilani I think.

I disagree here too.  The Regency still has all the trappings and
baggage of the 3I, ie, slow tech advances, culture that moves slowly,
and they would still have the way things were always done....  They
wouldn\'t advance far in 850 years...  They would have the high tech, but
also the fear of the virus and all that went with that.  I\'d put my
money on Solomani expansion.

I do think that they would become the 4th Imperium though....and then,
after they started through the Corrider, they\'d run into the "other" 4th
Imperium coming the other way.... Just about as advanced as they were in
some areas, more advanced in others.  Think of all the industrial
espionage, spying and combat encounters you could roleplay...

Now there are some possibilities!

Where is the canon for this?  What is the energy source that make them
bright?  What is thier energyu density and how do you know that it is above

a ship scan for 100 dia could not resolve a ship at .5 light years.

I could not include the zeros after the decimal to express the veiwing angle
of a 100 meter ship at 1 ly in this post.  All the computer in the world
could not hold the data if one binary bit represented every 100 square
meters of surface area in a 1 LY shell.

.5 to 1 year!  You\'d never find a moving ship.  You saw were it was a year ago!

and exactly how bright is that, in lummins please?  I\'d love to run the
energy densities at the reciever on this.  I dought you could detect a 1 meg
atomic blast at 1 light year in the light spectrum!

The cold gas thruster need only impart a tiny vecter that will build up a
angle of attack change over 3 ls distance of 1000s of Kms.  Note that all of
the manuvering on the Apolos were cold gas.  The mains were only for
generating the inial velocity.  Steering was cold gas thrusters and they
used a free return orbit insertion just incase they had a problem.  Apolo 13
did and it got them home.  They used the main LIM engine to get home faster
because they were running out of everything.

As for landing, you\'d have to dump your delta v and then you\'d be toast!
Speed is life when dealing with 6g intersepters.  You need a high delta V so
that your lower acceleration will still get you out the 100 dia limit before
they get into range.  Figure the vector math for the pirates approach, the
merchants accel. out and the SDBs persuit from orbit and you\'ll see what I
am saying is correct.  The SDB and Merchant both have to build up speed
while the pirate already has speed equal to or slightly greater than the
merchant will have at the 100 dia. shell.  If the pirate is a 6Ger he can
quickly match up on the out bound leg from 75 dias or better out and still
have enough V to coast out while looting his prize before the SDB gets to him.

The flare is a signal with a finite strength.  After propagating through a
sphere .5 lys across the signal strength will be in the mud unless the flare
is lethal at 1000 miles or more.  The signal will also take 6 months to
reach the reciever.

The ort cloud is .5 to 1 lY out from the primary.  The above was sarcasm.
It would take years and your sensor reading when you first recieved them
would be 6 months out of date.  The entire IN could not search the volume of
the ort cloud for a single ship in 1M years.  It\'s that big.

Sorry I keep forgeting that sarcasm does not work in email.  As for the
astrophysics, I have no problem with defering to Bruce in matters of
astrophysics but this is sensor tech and data aquisition and processing.  MY
baliwick.  In theory you could design a device that could hear a wispered
conversion taking place in Japan while being in New York.  I can tell you
with curtainty that it will never be built do to the practical problems
inherent in APPLIED science.  There are limits placed by the real world on
science like the noise threshold.  Once a signal drops below that level it
is unrecoverable.

Spotting a planet in another solar system is relatively easy.  We know
within a very limited area (much less that a single second of arc) of the
sky were that planet will be if it is there and can train high power low
viewing angle telescopes on that area.  We watch that area long enough we
see it.  Easy, but the ort clould covers our sky.  It\'s the needle in the
haystack problem.

Bruce, what is the smallest object in the rings of saturn that can be seen
well enough to identify with the whole sky scaner you talk about?  Exactly
how many of those size objects are there?  How long would it be before a new
one was detected?  What is the name of this device and where on the web can
I view the data on it?  How does it see a signal that has an amplitude less
than the universe\'s noise temperture?  

I would truely like to know.  I know of no techology in existance or
proposed in theory that can simultainious see both a spherical panarama and
resolve all objects present with a viewing angle of 10^-30 seconds, a
temperture of 200k, only emitting IR, and is a half light year away.

If this is a theoretical device, as I believe it has to be, how does it get
past the limits of quantum mechanics that set a finite limits of minimal
energy level that can the detected and the universe\'s noise level that is
orders of magnutude higher?

There are solid state devices the conver heat to electricity without

There are more.  All you need to do is put the heat to work and that work

Not always.  If you use it to debond H2 from O you get very little heat
compared to power input.  The energy is store in the chemical bonds.

When you charge a capaciter you heat loss is near zero regardless of charge.
Bateries product a moderate amount of heat in a slow charge.

Electricity can be use to due work other that producing heat at good
efficencies.  Heat is not the only \'high entropy\' energy and not all energy
ends up as heat.

Tell that to Appolo 13.  They nearly froze to death!  Their water supply
froze.  Explain that!  The reason was they were running with there power
shut down.  The same as the pirate would do.  Add an inner hull (thermal
shielding) seperarted from the outer with vaccume.  Minimal power useage
(lights, life support, and passive sensor).  You\'ll have to use some power
to heat the enter area to comfortable levels.  Waste heat will not be
enough.  A layer of that solid state thermal converter on the outside of the
enter hull to convert some of the radiate leakage back into electricty to
save power and cut emissions.  The outer hul temp will be very low.  That\'s
what you pay for with the thermal shielding option.

Only when heat gain from the sun is high.  They spend a lot of time with

Neither, it\'s the angle of defusion in the spec.

No that was my point.  Effective energy at the reciever = (transmited
power/surface area of the wave front) x area of reciever.  That is also why
I dought that a space ship is all that easy to pick up at a distance.
Signal strength is low, surface area is that of a sphere of that radi, and
the reciever array surface area is small.  Recieved power is small and if it
is small enough it is below the noise and quantum thresholds.  None of this
counts in the absorbion of heat by space matter.  Planetary space is dirty.
This provide both a higher local space temperture and a higher noise figure.

Are you doing tropospheric scatter research?  If so I\'d love to discuss it
with you.  I have some questions about this process as it aplies to
communication systems.  Do the best bounce frequences remain fairly constant
or doe the drift?  Is it a predictable drift?

True, again it comes down to scale.  A small move for the laser = a long

The pirate uses a double hull with a hard vacume between and solid state
thermal electric converters on the inner hull to convert the waste heat back
to electrical power and a 100% refecter shield one inch above that.  All
tech available today.  As for the pasive sensors a few watts would be more
than enough to pick up those oh so nice transponder signals that tasty
freighter is sending out or the ground control chatter to that other
freighter breaking orbit on such in such a course.  They make it so easy.
Taffic control is alway in the clear to warn others of their flight path.

Did not know this.  I think I may have fould the answer to the discrepincies
in Fighting ships.  It apear the a great many ships are \'second line\',
\'reserves\', \'auxilleries\', and \'ordinatary\' (moth balls).  The spinward
marches ordinary is located in corrador.

>

My quess basses on fighting ships is that there are as many battle riders
carriers as the are battle ships (about 40).  There is one batron of
Tigeress and 4 Kokirrak.  The Tigeress is a full 8 ship force but the
Kokirraks may be under stenth.  The Plankwells are in ordinary.  The battle
riders were relagated to \'force multipliers\' due to their weekness of
loosing their carrier and being wiped out.

Bases on FS ant the AHL books I would ssay there are 10-20 crurons (some of
them light) of \'heavy\' crusers and some carriers 5-10 crurons worth. 

40 battle ships
40 battle carriers
80-160 crusier
20-80 carriers

120-320 capital ships.  Add escorts and auxilleries ect and you have your
1000 ships.  Some of the FSs material hints the SM maybe a bit under
garrisoned and that they are mostly older ships.

Piracy notes:  2 Frontier configuration AHLs are in the the marches as
planetary defense units.  These units retained their weaponry.  Carried
small craft and missle load out are not discussed.  5 more of these are fuel
carriers and 2 are private cargo hauled.  These are striped of most of their
weapons.  One planetiod moniter is also pressent.  The IN move it with one
of their battle rider carrier when it was sold for one planet to another.
The marches is heaver with piracy than some other secters.

Only two cruron are regularly devided up for anti piracy patrol.  That 16
patrols at most.  The Batron and cruron are stationed at curtain strategic
bases and apparently rarely move.  A single tigress does a show the flag
trip every so often though.  This would explain some things and make sence.
While at a known base these ships can easily be contacted and dispatched to
trouble spots.  If they regularly patrol then getting intel to them would be
a problem if their courses were at all event driven.  The IN would have to
send out fleet couriers to wait where they hoped they jump to.  Have the
ships in base 90% of the time make them FASTER to respond to trouble as they
do not have to be hunted down.  It woulds also explain how pirates could
operate.  They stay away from navy bases any the navy only uses a fraction
of it\'s abilities in anti piracty patrols unles a pirate base is dicovered.

The navy has an armed jump 6 messenger ship, the fleet courier, to pass the
word if there is trouble.

FS says there are arround 1000 scout couriers in the marches that could be
reactivate to duty in case of war.

FS also says that main line naval bases are massive construtions.

With the above information I would say the IN spending is mush greater that
we have postulated in ships, bases, and operations.  The fleet courier
operations are probably maintained for intel gathering and C^3I.  Bases are
more common and more extensive.  Ships remain mostly at the bases.  This
would save money in upkeep and allow the crew some form of life.  There is a
massive mothball fleet in the Corrador subsector (100+ crusiers and 80+
battle ships.)  More than likely a large persentage of the naval ships that
are not at bases are on interdiction duty or in rotation for interdiction
duty.  Thiese ship would have much higher maintainence cost.

There are perhaps 50 system that will never be bothered by pirates due to
local fleets and naval bases but that still leave 350 posible targets.

From all this I would say the the IN is bases more on a \'real cost\' model of
naval operations than the simplified system used for player chacaters.  More
like T4 pocket impires and less like TCS.  TCS is a simplified tactical game
after all.  No one really expects it the closely mirror what would be
reality.  To make it more real would to overly complicate the game.  A ships
that remains occupied but in port cost less to maintain than one the is on
constant patrol but the current rule say they cost the same.  A mothballed
ships costs a fraction of the cost of a docked ship to maintain but you have
demothballing cost and time if you want to use it.  With the mothbal fleet
in Corrador the IN is in a good position to bring these ship online to
counter any aggression in the Marches but saves money.  The mothballed ships
are older ships retired from service but one that could still be usefull in
case of war.  When they are no longer viable they are sold as surplus
recouping some of the investment in them.  A very sound fiscal policy.

Piracy is posible under this pattern IF the pirate stays in the more back
water systems or on the trade routes between main systems.  There lives are
not easy and booty is far from sure but it is posible to exist.  The navy is
the sleeping giant.  Pirates are very happy about wars too.  They give up
piracy and start picking over the battle fields.  A pirate in a war zone had
better keep a very low profile.  One blast form a type T spinal mount and no
more pirate.  The nave on a war footing will not be very understanding about
ships that are not what they seem to be.  Better have your transponder on
people or at least be ready to turn them on when you enter a control zone.
Even the navy will under stand why you want to keep a low profile in you
free trader when enemy cruron may be arround especially if you are carring
their fresh food to the base.

I\'m afraid that FS state the tigress was deployed in the Marches as one 8
ships batron.  It does say in AHL that such formation are often devided in
war time to provide core ships for squadrons.

at the start of the fourth war.  They took high losses during the opening
battles.  The enemy targeted the carrier and then cleaned up the riders once
they could not escape.  Battle riders were then relagated to the reserves as
force multipliers.  Basicly assualt ships.

According to cannon of FS and AHL there must be a huge mothball fleet in
Corrador.  See above for some numbers.

One would assume they\'d arm not only on safe distance, but on safe 
trajectories too.  Wouldn\'t do to take out your buddy who\'s 10 degrees off the 
bad guy.  And this would keep them from blowing up in the tubes.

Well, if it has a reasonably high angular velocity (more than something like 10
milliradians/day) it probably looks exceptional, yes.  Sort of depends on what
size of area you\'re talking about hiding _in_, there\'s quite a lot of 30 meter
rocks in your average solar system, and their orbits are probably chaotic
enough that keeping track of them really isn\'t practical.  My point was mainly
that given a choice between emitting a certain amount of heat as IR, and the
same amount of heat as reflected visual, the reflected visual might actually be
less \'interesting\' to a sensor looking for you.

Btw, I think that shape resolution is almost a non-issue -- if we try resolving
things in 5,000A visual light with a 10-meter diffraction-limited telescope you
still only get .05 microradians, which will allow recognizing a 30 meter ship
as something other than a point of light at about a light-second.  Using IR
your resolution is a lot worse.

Some of the discussions on how a pirate supports himself are
relevant here as well. Can someone scrounge or improvise
cheap replacements for life support materials and maintenance
requirements?

A Free Trader can easily hold three pairs of adults and a couple
kids for each pair. If it has no bank payment any more, the price
of running this ship for a year would be about Cr520000 for
life support, plus the cost of the annual maintenance, plus
any berthing fees at starports, plus any damage or unexpected
equipment failures - that annual maintenance on your jump drive
has never been described in canon as including a warranty.

86 tons of cargo can support these expenses with a pretty dependable
level of success, but I\'m getting more of a "Merchant Clan" feeling from 
this than "Star Gypsies" - even with the minimum Free Trader example,
this group has more capital wealth and more cash flow than
many small corporations.

Not that this is a bad thing. Puts me in mind of the family merchant
ships from Cherryh\'s work like _Merchanter\'s Luck_.

Anyone want to try raising your kids on a Free Trader?

My take on the SDB\'s being used as revenue cutters would be, yeah, they\'d use 
them, if for no other reason than to break the monotony of a long patrol.  
IMTU, they\'d send them out for like 6 months at a time, just like we do nuke 
subs.  Only a percentage of them would be doing customs inspections, say, 
maybe 25% of them at any one time.  The other reason to use them would be for 
training purposes.  Action of any kind keeps your swabbies sharp.  If they\'re 
on constant 6 month patrols, there\'d be an awful lot of \'The Bug\', and morale 
will be in the toilet.  It\'s easier to keep troops in line if you give them 
something *real* to do.

Well, thermodynamics specifies that the maximum amount of work (non-entropic
energy) you can get out of a heat differential is (amount of heat
transferred)*(1-(absolute temperature of destination)/(absolute temperature of
source)) -- the remaining energy is transferred as heat into the destination. 
This also applies to refrigeration, which is what a laser \'heat pump\' really
is.  As a laser has a fairly high effective temperature, it requires you to
pump energy into the laser if you want to transfer heat out with the laser.

Reminds me of something I did in my previous D&D game, which I ran for
about 6 years until I finally painted myself into a corner where my
choices were a. be cheesy or b. allow the game to conclude.  (It\'s
concluded, in with a satisfactory save-the-plane and
eliminate-much-of-the-enemy-god\'s-streangth end, and only a few loose
plot threads)

Basically, anything "important" in the game has a physrep - physical
representation.  It might be smaller (a sword-shaped letter opener,
rather than a magical bastard sword, for example), but it\'s unique
enough to remind people of what it represents.

I found that with physreps there were three nice effects.

1: there wasn\'t argument over "I thought you had the frob!" \'I thought
_you_ had the frob!\' `What do you mean, Greg has the frob?!` Whoever
has the physical object, their character has the item it represents.
Pass it around as necessary.

2: if a physrep\'s effect, or the activation of the physrep\'s effect,
isn\'t obvious, the GM can look around for who has the object and act
appropriately.

3: how many stories have you read where the protagonist "happened" to
pick up an item which "happened" to be just what he needed later?
Many.  How many stories where they left the really powerful, necessary
item, behind?  Fewer.  If something has a physrep, it is likely to be
important for the story.  Not guaranteed either way, so don\'t count on
it, but likely.

I was also considering using pente stones or M&Ms to keep track of
ammo.


Anybody else do this kind of thing?  Suggestions, comments?

I dunno.  Seems to me a SDB makes a fairly decent multimission boat if you

Experience and *luck*.  Keeping your eyes open and your ears to the grapevine, you can learn a *LOT*, especially when you put the pieces together with everything *else* you know.  This is what makes the difference between a subbie merchant just barely making the fuel payments and a Free Trader crew making the beginnings of a sector wide trading house.

Last Friday I went to my local used bookstore hoping to complete my
Honor Harrington Series. You see, I had heard about HR on the TML and
when I saw a complete set in near mint condition I immediately bought
the first 4. I also picked up a couple of Weber\'s other works.

They were gone...  Gasp...  sputter... I\'ll have to pay FULL PRICE!

But, In Enemy Hands was there, again in mint condition. Apparently I
have an anal-retentive high-volume Weber reader in the vicinity. Lucky
me!

Getting to the point now, I also saw some other titles I recognized from
the TML. Anyone care to recommend or warn me about these?

L. Neil Smith
  Nagasaki Vector
  Henry Martyn (Space piracy, Oh No!)
  Tom Paine Maru (More space pirates!)

The Midshipman\'s Hope series by Author Fein-something. Looks to be 4 or
5 mint volumes from the same Weber reader.

I have generally had good fortune following the advice of this list.
Exception - Ian Banks\' Culture series shipped from England did not quite
meet expectations.  

I was rather disappointed in the other Weber Books I bought. "Crusade"
and "In Death Ground" are more like traveller technology (more
conventional drives -none of the wedges from HR). But I found them much
less interesting partly due to the unending carnage. In Death Ground is
about 600 pages of endless battle fleets being turned into plasma. At
the end, you\'ve only read the first installment. I felt "Part 1" should
have been on the outside cover. I will not be buying the conclusion.

How about instead simply adding some other symbol to the list (like the #
sign),  which says
	pi# 	Piracy is primarily a plot device. (this code may be combined
 		with other pi Codes)

So hans could use pi-# and I could use pi+#.

Under MT, based upon one of the issues of MTJ, you can reduce the
variability by nearly half by taking a significantly longer (and harder)
navigational task.

The basic reaction procedure will fill in the void (since other rules are
lacking) to account for such factors as how full are his holds, how tired
his crew, how he percieves you threat wise (For Ex, are you bigger, are you
known for "Muggerhunting", are you known for crack gunners, are you known
for being undercrewed). A positive reaction (Friendly) indicates you just
don\'t fit his target profile, or he\'s being watched, etc, while a negative
(hostile) reaction indicates he\'s ready and rarin\' to go at you. It covers
the intangibles that aren\'t covered by the starship encounter tables (which
only tell you hull type, mission (which may include piracy), and basic
heading (Inbound, outbound, loitering, jumping). Creative and consciencious
use of metasystems (like encounters and reactions) are prerequisites (IMHO)
for good GMing.

Two things:
1) the number of insignificant encounters DOES affect both how many targets
there would be, as well as just how low the actual percentages of private
craft are piratical.

2) Under MT (which is the source I keep close at hand), there is no
reduction in pirate chance for starport type. Only for what type of hulls.

{now responding to no one in particular)

One other thought about piracy and the 3i: One bit I have noticed is that
Hans and Ian both seem to think of the Imperial Government as some form of
federal government, which includes internal policing as part of it\'s
duties. I don\'t; instead I see the 3I as more of a confederation, with only
verly limited policing powers for "internal matters", basically limiting
imperial crimes to those which directly threaten the stability of the
imperium or it\'s nobility or officials, plus murder and deprivation of
basic sophont rights (which IMTU, specifically does NOT include the right
to property). IMTU, the imperium may take any actions deemed needed to
prevent external threats, and violations of the articles of membership, and
acts of the Emperor, but piracy (IMTU) is considered a local enforcement
matter, just like assault, theft, etc. IMOJ can extradite you, if the
request is in the system, when you get caught elsewhere, but they won\'t be
actively hunting you unless you (a) murdered* someone, (b) kidknapped
someone and then left the local jurisdiction, (c) committed tax fraud, (d)
attempted to overthrow legitimate IMPERIAL authority, (e) used unlawful
weapons vis a vis nukes chem or bio, or (f) violated imperial property,
including data, officials, agents, or symbols.

* murder, as I\'ve seen it defined for Traveller, is "The unreasonable and
unjustified taking of a sophont\'s life". I use the and as a logical and,
thus it is only murder if it is BOTH unjustified AND unreasonable. Thus,
killing crewmen while attempting to commit piracy via use of force
ship-to-ship isn\'t, IMTU, murder, but if the pirate slits the throats of
the crewmen after he\'s captured them, he becomes an imperial target for
murder. Likewise aslan duels and vargr infighting are both reasonable
(culturally), and thus not imperial crimes if death occurs, but may still
be local crimes. Ship owners know that by fighting back at a pirate, they
are running a reasonable risk of having crewmen die or be gravely injured,
or even lost to space, and, IMTU, that to avoid "Imperial ENtanglements"
most pirates IMTU will NOT go on wanton killing sprees, nor take vacc suits
or rescue balls, nor shoot up a surrender, nor space crews on a capture,
and more than likely, if you don\'t shoot up the pirate, he\'ll take you
cargo and cash, and disable your PP for long enough to get away. If you
cooperate, he may even leave you some, so you\'re not totally crushed.

Because IMTU the imperium not only doesn\'t care, but really doesn\'t have
the de jure authority to prevent piracy (altho it does have de facto), it
only hits rings and ones who don\'t at least attempt to look like they have
some legitamacy. IMTU, there is this little thing called the pirate\'s code,
and in Gurps terms, it\'s a 10 point code of honor: Never kill surrenderers,
never take a prize unless you have a letter of marque, never leave the
survivors in such a straight so as to undully risk their lives, Don\'t open
fire until they refuse to surrender, never waste your crew\'s lives on
ulikely sources of income, don\'t violate the rules of warfare. Pirates IMTU
who follow this tend to get ingored BY POLICY as being a nuisance, not a
threat, and often are subject to wartime activation just like mercs, and
are liscenced in just the same way. Violators tend to become targets of
meson fire from factor J mounts. (A J mount\'s burst radius will, if fully
bracketed, engulf a 400td corsair, and by striker, this means totally
vaporize it).

Also, while I runt (basically) MT, I use the VEHICULAR COMBAT rules, not
the space combat rules (which are the same as HG for combat resolution...
Ick!). This means ranges tend to be fairly close for space combat, and
ability to hit is determined by TL. I use the folowing task for starhip
fire:

To hit with a direct fire weapon in space combat (varies, by Fire control
tables), Gunnery and Computer Model, target\'s defmod, combat task.
Referee:
	if taget has made a successful sand roll vs firing ship, and
weapons fired are lasers, increase difficulty by one (to represent the
ablative effects of the sand).
	If computer assistance is not available, use Int, and increase
difficulty by 1 level.
	If target has been pinpointed reduce difficulty by one level.
	If target has not maneuvered since last turn in which it was hit,
reduce difficulty by 1 level. This never applies for shots fired the same
turn.
	If firing ship has no active sensors, increase difficulty by 1 level.

I don\'t know what "sensor threshold" means in this context. It\'s certainly
possible to detect an object that is much dimmer per square arcsecond than
the background - infrared telescopes do it all the time; the IR sky is about
1x10^-15 watts/m2 micron in brightness at 2 microns wavelength, for example,
and the the dimmest objects currently detected by the Keck telescope are 
about 1x10^-19 watts/m2 micron. As long as the background is stable, sources
much fainter than the sky can be detected relative to it. The main reason that
the sky isn\'t stable is quantum mechanical - poisson noise in the number of 
photons arriving in a given unit time - and that can be reduced relative to
the signal by collecting more photons, since the poisson noise goes up as only
the square root of the number of photons involved, and hence goes up as the
square root of the time or collecting area, while the real signal goes up 
linearly with time or collecting area.

"Twenty sigma" means "twenty times the noise level", in some particular 
integration time with the given collecting area. Signal-to-noise isn\'t just
the ratio of the brightness of target to brightness of background but is in
fact a function of collecting area, efficiencies, and time spent integrating.

>It\'s a quantum physics issue.  If

I have no idea what "viewing angle approached that of one photon" means.
In any case, the signal levels are well above single-photons (trust me, I 
did real calculations with real numbers to justify these sensor models.)
The main noise source is (as previously indicated) poisson noise in the
background. (Internal electronic noise is effectively negligible for 
modern imaging sensors.)

Astronomers routinely observe objects where they are collecting only a 
photon per second (even in a ten meter telescope). You just have to collect
long enough for those photons to add up to a real signal. Granted, a single
photon isn\'t a real detection - but 400 photons is, and it\'s just a matter
of waiting long enough or having enough collecing area. Amplification 
doesn\'t enter into it.

Something emitting 0.1% as much energy as a 300 K object is emitting as much
energy as a 53 K object, since power radiated goes as temperature to the fourth
power, but that\'s a minor point. Emitted power goes *up* with the blackness
of an object (emissivity = 1 - reflectivity); that\'s why they\'re called
blackbodies. A 99.999999% *white* 300K object would emit only as much power
as a 3K blackbody. It\'s also radiating all that power at very
different wavelengths than a colder blackbody and would still be easily
detectable.  Most of the power in the 3K blackbody comes out at milimetre 
wavelengths, most of the (small) amount of power in the 300K object comes out
in the mid-infrared. Easy to tell apart.

In reality, the main background signal isn\'t actually the 3K cosmic background
anyway, but scattered sunlight and thermal emission from zodiacal dust. That
does look like a 300 K blackbody, but with a distinctive spectral bump that 
is hard to hide against...and it\'s optically thin, so it\'s dimmer per unit
area than a solid object like a spacecraft.

>and that 300k can be reduced by technological means I\'ve

I certainly don\'t think that thermos bottles make things become colder than
they originally were, or that if I put a heat-generating object in a thermos
bottle - or a vacuum - or wrapped it with insulation - that it would become
cold. Refrigerators make things cold; they also have to put the heat somewhere.

>[cold-gas thrusters]
>Use H2 at 2k and throw 100 kilos out at 100 mps
This will accelerate a one-thousand-tonne pirate ship by about a centimeter
per second, which seems somewhat inadequate.

>>And the colder the exhaust, the *less* thrust it\'ll give
>Depends on launch speed to.
This depends on how you launch it. When people who actually know what they\'re
talking about refer to a "cold gas thruster" they mean something that basically
opens a valve in a bottle of compressed gas to let it expand into vacuum
and provide thrust. The velocity of the gas comes from its internal kinetic
energy, which is proportional to its temperatuer. 
I know of no good way to accelerate a gas
without heating it in the process - if you\'re going to use non-thermal
ways to accelerate something you\'re better off flinging away a solid rather
than a gas.

It\'s been suggested before..I think Shadow is a big proponent of using

I agree with you, but IFAIK the errors are all in the ships themselves, not
in the accompanying text or the essays about the Imperial Fleets. I\'m sure
that the diagrams of squadron size are schematic, not literal, as the TL14
Tender carries 3 BRs and the TL15 Tender carries 6, so rather than the 4
BRs the diagram shows a more likely size IMO, would be 6 BRs and
accompanying Tenders.

These seem consistent with what I understand canon to be. I\'ve always felt
that trying to understand the IN\'s deployments and Trav\'s ships in WWII
terms is a mistake, and that the age of sail gives a much better base
model. Hoever for ship classes and relative tonnages the Washington Treaty
ships of the 20\'s and 30\'s seem to be useful.

My friends and I have often speculated as to how it is that the US has so
many cops per capita and still has such a high crime rate (especially
murder) compared to other places. Note this is not an attempt to start a
gun debate (so there).

Modern artillery relies on knowing these things anyway. A battery of guns
can achieve amazing accuracy these days if they have had the time to do a
proper survey of their positions and have good maps, and if you want good
fire support this is essential. They also go to a lot of trouble to make
sure their weather readings are accurate and keep very careful records of
barrel wear, etc to ensure accuracy.

IIRC you can make proximity fuses that use a capacitance sensor to tell
when they are at the right distance from the ground. These should be immune
to just about anything.

MT and on a Scout-like ship rejects more than 100MW of power.

150MW is a bright source.

Intergrate long enough. Bruce\'s sensor numbers (signatures in this
case) simply apply magnitudes to hulls radiating--I beleive the
baseline was 1 100dton sphere, but I could be wrong.

Huh? A ship scan that does the whole sky one or two times in a half
an hour, that can _just_ detect a 100dton ship obviously won\'t
detect the same ship in the same amount of time at 0.5ly. If the
same sensor integrates for longer periods of time (or adds scanns
together over time, same thing) it can see fainter objects at the
same distance, or the same object farther away.

HUh? it always applys. Intergrate long, see fainter. Period.

IT DOESN"T NEED TO. Stars are typically point sources (distant ones,
certainly). You don\'t need to resolve a target to detect it. The
sensor operator would simply see a bright point, and have a rough
idea of where it is (somewhere within the arc reprented by the
pixel). He would also have spectroscopic data, and after a while, it
might even move on the sky.

>.5 to 1 year!  You\'d never find a moving ship.  You saw were it was a year ago!
 
That doesn\'t mean you don\'t know that it _was_ there. A fusion
rocket ship breaking into the system at 1ly would be visible now I\'d
wager.

I\'ll work it out when I\'m back at home. 150MW isotropically radiated.
That\'s 1.34E-25 w/m^2 at 1ly or so.

Sorry, but no. A shell doesn\'t arm itself until it\'s a good way out of the
barrel, and modern fuses are just about impossible to set off early.
However a good close explosion can set off the shell itself - this is how
ammo dumps go up if they are pooorly laid out.

When I edited  _101 Religions_ most of them came with the URP from WBH. To
avoid complications we grouped all the religions by 1 of the codes and then
converted the number into a textual description. Tedious, but not too
difficult. The only problem I could see is avoiding the same words that DGP
used. We took the decision to avoid the problem entirely, which was a shame
as one of the TML Peters (Peter B IIRC) had expanded the URP quite
usefully.

I agree the codes are a great creativity jogger - in much the same way that
a UWP is. It makes you think to justify the stats, which makes for an
interesting universe.

I liked the DGP stuff (but then I liked everything they did). Nancy Parker also
did a pretty good article called "Aspects of Culture" in Digest 16, with a few
more tables. I seem to remember there was also something in Space Gamer, but
maybe I\'m wrong.

One thing not covered by any of these: I\'d like to see something about status of
the arts, architecture, etc. Is there an emphasis on beauty or on functionality,
is life ordered or chaotic. To a certain extent these could be inferred from
other cultural ratings, I guess, but whatever ratings emerged should be able to
act as the DNA for the "flavour" of a system\'s society.

This particular claim got a little out of hand - no-one - not me or Merrick
or Steve or anyone - was claiming that you could easily see lurking pirates
in the outer part of the oort cloud. I did make the claim that a really 
big military array could see targets in the *inner* Oort cloud - the
Oort cloud really starts at about a thousand AU out (depending on who you
talk to, of course; it\'s not like there\'s a big sign in space saying

A major population-10 world might have a PEMS-15.5 sensor - MCr 250,000
(about as much as a battleship), 50,000 m2 of collecting area. A battleship
might have a million megawatts of power (and most likely no IR masking,
since battleships tend to run out of surface area), for an IR signature of
1.5. The sensor array has an Impossible task to detect a target out to 
a range of (15.5+1.5=17), or about 3000 AU. It\'s true that there are a lot of
bodies out there - but few that are radiating at the 2000 K temperatures of
a fully-powered battleship\'s radiators; the battleship would stand out.
(Not easily, but MCr 250,000 buys a lot of computer power to keep track of
which source is which; "millions of bodies" will be recorded in its database.)
If the battleship was mostly powered-down, or using various baffling tricks,
(if it knows where the sensor array is), then it would be more able to hide.
There are tricks the sensor operator can use to balance things out partially.

A dinky little pirate, on the other hand, can hide pretty effectively in the
oort cloud at full power or no - my main contention is that it can\'t hide from
a big (high-pop world) sensor array at one light-second.

Note that seeing signals less than the temperature of the background is

The half a light year thing I don\'t feel obliged to defend, since I never
made that claim. Nor did I claim that you look at the whole spherical
panorama simultaneously (one scans a piece at a time). Nor that we can do
all of this at current tech levels (though the extrapolations are pretty 
smooth in FFS2; the main assumption is that high-TL sensors can be built much
bigger than modern telescopes.)

At the ranges that I was talking about, like one light-second, these 
detections are much easier. A
typical scoutship is about 15th magnitude in reflected visible sunlight at
one lightsecond. (I have to double check whether that\'s for a black hull or
a grey hull.) There are telescope systems even now that can scan the whole
sky down to 15th magnitude every night (a piece at a time) and relatively
complete catalogs of the whole sky down to this level; making a system that
matched all detections with these catalogs is within the realm of modern
technology and moderate cost (less than a million dollars including the
telescope.) High TLs and more money will make things much more sensitive.

(By the way, if anyone cares, the closest you can see this scout with your
naked eye is about 6000 km (as a 6th magnitude star.))

The waste heat is where the scoutship\'s real problem comes from, of course.
A T4/TNE scout with a 100 MW power plant, generating 10 MW of waste heat
(generous assumptions) is ~7-8th magnitude in the near-IR (2-5 microns); it
stands out pretty sharply. IR sensors are going to get even better faster 
at high TLs (through things like cooling the telescope optics); the 
hypothetical scout is easy to see. A pirate running its power plant at any
level will be similarly easy to see. Running on batteries, with its hull 
cooled down, and almost no life support, it becomes more possible to hide.
I have previously said that its\' on the margin; a pirate running very cold
can probably hide from a low-TL or low-pop world\'s sensors at the 100 diameter
limit - barely, as long as the world has no forward-deployed sensors or SDBs.
(I suppose I need a DSR rule for "extreme shutdown" - when all the power plant
is shut down, minimum life support (from suits), refrigerated hull, etc.; 
might be worth another -0.5 or so.)

David Feintuch.  The Midshipman series is well written, and I devoured each
one.  It is also an extremely depressing series - the protagonist is
literally tortured by his experiences and David Feintuch is a good enough
author to transmit that to the reader.  By the end of Fisherman\'s Hope, we
have seen Nicholas Seafort succeed at every task put in front of him, but at
a tremendous personal cost.

I recommend the series, but with reservations.

I suspect that this is exactly what does occur, since it is canon that
large masses precipitate ships out of jump space, and the 100 dia. limit
is simply a convenient rule of thumb, so I\'d favor this.

True, but a planetary station only needs to keep track of the ones
within the a few lightseconds of the mainworld - each time a new one comes
comes into that sphere it studies it intently with LIDAR, high-res imaging,
spectroscopy, etc for a couple of hours, then adds it to its database of 
targets currently close enough to be confusing...

Jumping into another system, on the other hand, telling asteroids from
defenders is much more painful.

Remember that those deep meson sites need targeting data, and those pretty
much have to be on or near the surface.  I think a heavily-stealthed

You can have both on a ship under HG. You just can\'t have any secondary
batteries of the same type as the spinal mount.

Post High Guard, all the references to the Kinuir class ships called them
as \'Colonial Cruisers\', not \'Battle Cruisers\'.

They\'re just an overblown gunboat, and not even optimised under HG. They\'re
good for showing the flag and scaring pirates with the PA barbettes. The
Sydkai (?) was a much better ship... (MTJ) but that\'s a different story.

Buy "On Ballik Station" and enjoy it. It\'s the first book and the one

I read the first one and liked it well enough...although the hero was
sort of introspective for my tastes. Sooner or later, I intend the
read the others.

Well, in most of the HH books there is at least one space combat scene
and one or two personal combat scenes. Less combat oriented than David
Drake\'s books or the Sten series, though.  I have to admit to liking
the Sten books, space opera and all. ;->

"A Concise History of the Imperium" in Digest 18 doesn\'t specifically mention when Ley
was incorporated, but does mention that Depot/Ley was attacked by a long range raid by
the Julian Protectorate in 185.

This essay seems to form the basis of the essay on the pacification campaigns in the
Milieu 0 campaign - the raid on Ley is mentioned there on p.121

My guess is that it was taken during the earlier part of the Julian Wars.

I became interested in the question of whether or not it would even
be possible to detect a small ship in some part of the oort cloud.
Not as a routine detection task (that fits within a turn sequence,
limiting integration time a lot), but rather in the broad sense. A
fixed in-system sensor, building up data over time. CouHaow far out
could they detect, say, a scout ship adding up their routine scans
over time (how many intergration periods to increase the sensitivity
by 0.5, 1.0, and so forth--and what is the maximum for this).

Nah, HG just doesn\'t let you have two weapon systems of the same type with
different attack ratings.  Messes up the USP.  Of course, as GT doesn\'t _use_ a
USP, this isn\'t a problem....

Very politically-driven Libertarian fiction. Not to my taste. "Henry Martyn" 
is an extreme example of the lets-put-gunpowder-technology-in-space 
approach...

>The Midshipman\'s Hope series by Author Fein-something.

One thing you could consider, after reading the Forester-influenced 
Weber and Feintuch, is skipping straight to the source and reading C.S.
Forester\'s "Horatio Hornblower" novels, and (even better) Patrick O\'Brian\'s
wonderful Aubrey/Maturin novels (staring with "Master and Commander".) 
There are many (myself among them) who tend to give Traveller space combat a 
Napoleonic feel...and these give a wonderful feel for the era. Forester is a
much better writer than Weber. (And O\'Brian is so much better than any of them
that they don\'t deserve to be mentioned in the same paragraph, but he\'s not
to everyone\'s taste.)

(Nostalgia for Napoleonic naval warfare may sound odd from someone who\'s 
also currently debating interferometric sensor ranges and infrared background
radiation...but in some ways, long Traveller sensor ranges are more
Napoleonic than Harpoon-like; Napoleonic ships could see each other at much
greater ranges than their weapons could reach too, as opposed to modern
missile-armed ships. Where Traveller differs from the Napoleonic model is more
that the relevant regions of engagement/operation (the 100-diameter limit) 
are very small compared to the weapons and maneuver ranges of the ships 
involved. It\'s as if Napoleonic ships could Jump from one side of the atlantic
to the other after six hours sail away from port.)

ALL science fiction, because human beings are fallible, eventually will
create some kind of contradiction.   Reactionless thrusters that produce
more thrust than a laser of the equivalent power are violations of the laws
of thermodynamics... you can build perpetual-motion machines with them.  We
went over this on the Trinity list a while back.

In science fiction, you eventually will get some consequences you don\'t
like.  At that point you can either ignore them, change your assumptions,
or live with the consequences.  Changing the assumptions is only a
short-term solution because the new ones will eventually produce more
consequences you don\'t like.

I don\'t consider anything a \'handwave\'.  You make a universe that is as
internally consistent as you can stand it to be.

And when we finally DO reconcile the two theories, things will be possible

If it\'s just a wideband radio message, then yes, you can be anyone you want

Neil Smith\'s stuff is ok.  I wouldn\'t put it on a \'gotta have\' list, but it 
*would* be on my \'grab it if it shows up someplace\'.

What\'s on my \'gotta have\' list is just about everything by H. Beam Piper:

      Little Fuzzy
      4-Day Planet
      Uller Uprising
      Space Viking

There\'s a couple others, too, but I can\'t remember them off the top of my head.

If I was into doing a real high tech game, I\'d get some *selected* Jack L.

There have to be safe havens somewhere or there won\'t be pirates.  If the

You are right.  It looks more like a special forces transport ship than any
thing else.  I would not put it in line of battle as a light escort.  It\'s

Sometimes it takes time for an idea to jell.  There is something hinky with
CTs spinward marched ship numbers but I have not nailed it down yet.  There
is not enough data for a fully reasoned responce yet.  There may never be.
Look at FS.  Do those number and break down look right to you?  There are

Check my post regarding FS.  I have not seen any hard data from you that
prove your \'feelings\' either.  Canon says 1000 ships but not what ships or
in what condition of readiness, or lots of other details like ratios of
capital of escorts ect.  With so little hard data a \'feel\' for the strength
of the navy and it\'s character is all I get.

Besides I\'m not trying to fill the gaps I\'m looking for canon.  I could come
up with a Order of battle and fill in the missing ships if I choose to.  It
is not that hard.  Write up a few heavy escorts and parsel them out and
you\'re pretty close when combine with the data in FS.  It\'s the missing
classes and the ship balence that disturb me.

The heavy equipment in the shipyard is a one time expense. Upkeep on that
will be minimal like your 1% maintainence but that was my point a 1% pay out
on the support structure would be reasonable and the support structure in
the Marches is extensive.

They do need work structures for the workers use.  The dock would look like
a large tunnel of girders for the heavy material transporters to work on.
10 tons may be 0 weight but a slow moving great mass is tough for an
unanchored man ti stop in free fall.  It would be much more efficient than
working in bare open space.  There would also be work craft and stocks of
materials stored.

I never said that.  There is more to maintanence that just the overhaul.
Remember the increasing cost of maintainence with age thread.  There has to
be parts or systems that must be replaced.

Please see my other post.  Delta V can and does also refer to relative
velocity depending on notational style.  It is also call Vr(reference
point).  It depends on notation style.

velocity = delta v of 100 mps(SDB)

acceleration = delta v of 20mps^2(SDB)

I do not understand this comment.  A small change in vertor at a great
distance with a high relative velocity can make a great deal of difference
in the final arrival point.  The point of cold gas is to avoid detection by
running cold.  If the target can see you use your 6Gs

A stealth aproach with a ram coating.  If they are using search radar launch

By the way what is ROTFL?

Cold gas manuver and the planets gavity well for breaking and slingshoting
just like the apolo missions.  Time would be about equal to the time it
takes to boost out from the planet to 100 dia.  You have more inial speed
but you do not accelerate.  This lets to match speeds with either a freshly
arrived ship or one on the way out.  You\'ll have to hard dock to the inbound
ship to change it\'s vecter back out system.  The outbound ship you just
coast along with.

If the planet rotation time is greater than your transit time and the planet
is large it could add some orbit time it you are landing on the planet.  It
could make an hour or two at most diference.  Not much I\'ll admit.  A good
pilot could cut this to as little as minutes with the proper aproach once
the communications officer finds out where you are suppose to land.  If is
an X port though you could be in orbit a while looking for a spot but that
would be a rare occurence.

Wait a minute here.  A planet moves a long distance in a day.  Almost
100dias for earth.  A similar planet with a shorter year would be imposible
to hit with that kind of time slop facter with and regularity.

Jump time = 168 hours +- 10%

Canon says the jump is \'straght line travel\' that can not intersect the 100
dia limit of any object over 1 mile.

Problem people.  What if the planet you want to go to is on the oposite side
on it\'s sun from you when you want to jump?  Do you wait half of that
planet\'s year?

I think we just found our nitch for the pirates.  Planetary rotation
relative to each other will make it necessary to stand out 100 steller
diameters to reach some worlds during curtain windows.  Travel times and
entry points will vary greatly with relative position of the primary worlds.

Anybody see a hole in this?  I know the the Milky way is a disk and that
most systems are in the plane of the disk so the behind the star or the
planet to fast to hit accuartely should exist from some points to others.

I don\'t think that the colonial and subsecter fleets are the same thing.
The subsecter fleets are the parts of the sector fleet assigned to a
particular subsecter.  I think the colonial fleets are a entirely different
set of ships.  This could be a matter of semantics though.  I think we are
both saying the same thing.  That there is the IN and a local forces both
present in the Marches Secter.

We could be tangle up in the word here.

True, but there are other trade offs for the extra credits. I have not had a

play or it I\'ll be able to use it as an economic background system in my TU.

I\'m not so sure at this assumtion now.  FS seems to say the most of the
Battle ships stay near there bases most of the time.  If that were true and
true for other classes of military ships then leave would not be much of a
problem and pirates would have room to work.  It would also cut down of IN
overhead.  A parked ship cost less to run than a active one.

Good point.  Could be that is one reason for them staying put in strategic

Good for you!  A logical ruling from on high with some minimal editing of

Good point.  They could secure they part of the port they needed but this
would only be true if there was a naval base with the star port.  I\'m sure
that military ships would need a thing or two not in civilian stocks.

The \'Sten\' series was great, except where it started turning weird toward the

Increasing sensitivity by 0.5 takes about a day worth of scanning and is probably
the limit for a target that can accelerate. You can also use single-arc
scanning to get a +0.5, and put your sensor out in the outer part of the
solar system to get it away from zodiacal dust (although then you need 
two sensors...) All of this gives a big top-of-the-line military array 
about a 17.5 sensitivity. That lets it see the prototypical scout target
(signature 0) out to a range of 17.5, or 10,000 AU (well into the Oort cloud). 
That\'s taking two weeks to scan the whole sky (twelve arcs at one day per 
arc roughly), and an Impossible task for each detection (maybe a 10% chance of
success for a really good operator), so it would probably take a month or 
two to really find the scout, at a cost of MCr 500,000 for the system.
If the scout was well-masked and running at low power, you could only see it 
out to 100 AU or so. (Add a difficulty level for "surprise" and the 
detection range comes in by a factor of 3...)

From: Glenn Myers <glenn.myers@mailhub.ansys.com>
Subject: Travellerish Fiction - Weber and others

Hi all,

Last Friday I went to my local used bookstore hoping to complete my
Honor Harrington Series. You see, I had heard about HR on the TML and
when I saw a complete set in near mint condition I immediately bought
the first 4. I also picked up a couple of Weber\'s other works.

They were gone...  Gasp...  sputter... I\'ll have to pay FULL PRICE!

But, In Enemy Hands was there, again in mint condition. Apparently I
have an anal-retentive high-volume Weber reader in the vicinity. Lucky
me!

Getting to the point now, I also saw some other titles I recognized from
the TML. Anyone care to recommend or warn me about these?

L. Neil Smith
  Nagasaki Vector
  Henry Martyn (Space piracy, Oh No!)
  Tom Paine Maru (More space pirates!)

The Midshipman\'s Hope series by Author Fein-something. Looks to be 4 or
5 mint volumes from the same Weber reader.

I have generally had good fortune following the advice of this list.
Exception - Ian Banks\' Culture series shipped from England did not quite
meet expectations.

I was rather disappointed in the other Weber Books I bought. "Crusade"
and "In Death Ground" are more like traveller technology (more
conventional drives -none of the wedges from HR). But I found them much
less interesting partly due to the unending carnage. In Death Ground is
about 600 pages of endless battle fleets being turned into plasma. At
the end, you\'ve only read the first installment. I felt "Part 1" should
have been on the outside cover. I will not be buying the conclusion.

Bye All,

Glenn

While the information from the adventures may be the only canonical data
we have I would be somewhat leary of considering either the March
Harrier or the Empress Nicholle as typical.  After all if both ships
were not having financial problems would they really have gotten
involved in the adventures they did....

The needs of the adventures required that the players be relatively
poor.  In the case of the Empress Nicole from Twilights Peak the poverty
of the ship was empthasized by their need for Cr 3,500,000,000 to repair
their jump drives.  I note also that none of pregenerated charecters
for  either adventure posessed any levels of skill in either Broker or
Trader, and this may explain why the ships were relatively short of
funds.

[Adventure 3 Twilights Peak was published in 1980 before Broker & Trader
skills were introduced in 1981\'s Special Supplement 1 Merchant Prince,
which appeared in JTAS #12 but the Traveller Adventure  was published in
1983 & could have used the Breoker & Trader skills if desired.  It is
possible that these skills were deliberately left off the pregenerated
charecters so that making money would actually be a challenge & not a
statistical likelyhood.]

When you look at the ammount you can make in speculative trade in either
ship if you have a Broker 2 (or better) aboard you may have a better
idea of what is typical.  Speculative trade (using the canonical trade
system) can produce incomes of several _thousand_ percent per year (in a
jump 2 or better ship so you have more choice of which planet to sell
on) if done correctly.  This suggests that even if starting cash is only
a few thousand credits it will quickly become much more.

I took the reference of local systems "raising" colonial squadrons to mean
that the local world was buying obsolecent ships from the Imperial Navy. It
mentions somewhere in there that the world just needs the resources to
support the ships, not actually build them.

From the way it is written, the fleet diagrams in FSSI are of the
pre-Rebellion navy. The text describes the organization of the 3I Imperial
navy then goes on to describe the effects the Rebellion has had on the
organization.

BTW, several blocks of text and a couple of diagrams in FSSI are simply
reprints of material that appeared in the _Rebellion Sourcebook_, so you
may not be missing as much as you think, Hans.

I just finished "On Bassilisk Station" (on the TML\'s advice) -- I am
defintely able to see why Traveller fans would like it. I\'m tempted to
adopt Weber\'s universe lock-stock-and-barrel!

Has anyone done a write-up for such a campaign, or a good synopsis of all

Some of weber\'s later books are fairly verbose about the universe (sort of big
appendices).  Of course, his tech doesn\'t make much sense, and he\'s fond of
inventing \'new technology of the week\' in books, so don\'t expect too much

Heh.  There\'s a feature of disguising yourself as an asteroid I hadn\'t
considered, nor would most pirates, though I\'m sure a good tech would -- real
asteroids tend to spin.  Code your military black hull to gradually vary its
brightness, or possibly to shift a bright spot around the hull ;)

One of the fan-pages on the web has massive \'library\' type data for Honor\'s

Cool. The problem is time frame. It means that a fleet that jumps in

defines the Imperial assets available for the war (only a portion
of the total Imperial assets):



Analysing the counters (assuming I  haven\'t  lost  any  over  the
years) ...

Batrons
    Number: 32 of 11 different types
    Defense Factors: 147 (average 4.6 per squadron)

Crurons
    Number: 26 of 7 different types
    Defense Factors: 163 (average 6.3 per squadron)

Assaultrons
    Number: 8 of all same type
    Defense Factors: 48 (average 6 per squadron)

Tankrons
    Number: 2 of all same type
    Defense Factors: 8 (average 4 per squadron)

Scoutrons
    Number: 8 of 4 different types
    Defense Factors: 38 (average 4.8 per squadron)

Colonial Batrons
    Number: 10 of 4 different types
    Defense Factors: 67 (average 6.7 per squadron)

Colonial Crurons
    Number: 19 of 9 different types
    Defense Factors: 107 (average 5.6 per squadron)

Colonial Assaultrons
    Number: 1
    Defense Factors: 4 (average 4 per squadron)



From this I make one deduction - that the Imperial fleet is  very
un-homogeneous (in contradiction to FSSI), and one  assumption  -
that there is one capital  class  ship  per  defense  factor.  In
other words there are (within the Spinward Marches at that  time)
eleven different classes of Imperial battleship/battlerider (plus
another four classes used by  the  Imperium\'s  colonial  forces).
There are also seven different classes of Imperial cruiser  (plus
another nine classes used by the Imperium\'s colonial forces).  It
would seem that the smaller the ship the more standardised it  is
likely to be (for Imperial forces), but colonial forces use  more
Crurons.

Additionally, there are no  destroyer  squadrons.  So  they  (and
other escort vessels) are subsumed into the squadron types listed
above.  Thus each defense factor represents a capital class  ship
and its escort wing.  (Of course, a destroyer squadron  could  be
labeled a "Scoutron", which would explain what a Scoutron capital
class ship is.)  In a Battlerider squadron  each  battlerider  is
counted but the battletender is only  counted  if  it  is  combat
capable (most are not, but the Lurenti class for example is).

In war time the activities of a number of Batrons and Crurons are
coordinated by a Fleet Admiral, and  as  such  are  considered  a
Fleet.  Assaultrons  and  Tankrons  may  be  added  depending  on
mission profile.  So called Scoutrons are  primarily  for  inter-
fleet use.  (For  example,  IMTU  the  Imperial  214th  Fleet  at
Glisten is composed of 2  Batrons,  3  Crurons,  and  a  Colonial
Cruron.)

In peace time Battleship squadrons are broken up into  individual
Dreadnaughts plus support ships and escorts (like a  current  day
US carrier group) and are deployed to  potential  trouble  spots.
Battlerider squadrons tend to  stay  in  Depots  or  are  out  on
training missions.  Cruiser squadrons are broken up into pairs of
Cruisers plus  support  ships  and  escorts  ...  called  CruDivs
(Cruiser Division), that patrol  Imperial  space.  Scoutrons  are
disolved and deployed  as  individual  vessels.  Assaultrons  and
Tankrons stay  in  Depots  and  at  strategic  points  throughout
Imperial space.

The  capital  class  ships  in  Imperial  regular  squadrons  are
primarily  TL15,  with  some  TL14  ships  awaiting   retirement.
(Retirement means either mothballing or transfer to the  colonial
forces.)  The capital class ships in Imperial colonial  squadrons
are either transfered ex-regular ships or localy  produced  ships
at inferior TL (13 or 14).

To summarise:  The Imperial Navy term "squadron"  (when  used  as
Batron, Cruron, etc) does not just mean  a  number  of  identical
ships, it refers to a mini fleet.  During the  5FW  the  Imperium
Navy had 404  regular  capital  class  ships  plus  178  colonial
capital class ships in the theater of operations  (plus  all  the
lesser ships).  582 capital class ships would be  almost  60%  of
the quoted 1000 ships ... a far higher percentage  than  I  would
have expected.  IMTU the total size of the Imperial fleet is  not
really relevant (just the size in theater) but I would  place  it
between 2000 and 3000.

My *evil* mind just came up with a lovely "technobabble" weapon.  It
fires a beam tuned to the molecular resonant frequency of the explosive
used in enemy shells. 

Which means that for much less power than a typical laser/maser
requires, you\'d have something that\'d set off unshielded explosives. 

Of course, the casings of most shells ought to be enough shielding. But
what happens when you take off the end cap to fuze the shell? <eg>

I\'ve gotten conflicting answers regarding this. I\'ve heard that

We have x-ray mirrors *now*. The trick is that they only work at
shallow angles of incidence. At those angles the layers of atoms in the
mirrors are effectively solid, even at x-ray wavelengths.

Has anyone read the F.M Busby series Star Rebel?  I believe there are 2 Bran
Tregare novels, 3 Rissa Kerguelin books and one w/ both (Alien Debt).  This
series postulates a tyrannical corporation on Earth who holds the monopoly on
interstellar (STL in this universe, but making use of the time-dialation
effects).  The corporation uses these ships to maintain contact w/ there
colonies, and many ships have mutinied against the company (crew members,
usually the 1st Officer and others, replacing the captains)  

Granted this is hardly Traveller, but the idea could work very well under
certain circumstances w/in a Trav campaign.

Remember that those deep meson sites need targeting data, and those pretty

H2 freezes at *20* K. And you are missing the primary point. With a gas
thruster, the exhaust velocity is determined by the
temperature/pressure of the gas. To get hydrogen to exit a thruster at
100 m/s, it\'s going to have to be *very* warm. I don\'t have the
formulas handy, but I\'m willing to bet that it\'d be *above* 200k.
Likely above 300 K.

No. The exhaust velocity depends *entirely* on the nozzle design and
the temp/pressure upstream of the nozzle.

To put it a different way....

For an *ideal* nozzle the exhaust velocity is equal to the average
velocity of the molecules in the exhaust. That is determined by the
temp in the reaction (or expansion for a cold gas rocket) chamber. 
For a cold gas rocket, you have the pressure in the chamber determined
*solely* by the temperature of the liquid/gas.

So for a given temp of input gas (or liquid) the exhaust velocity is
*fixed*. 

You could try pressurizing the feed to the expansion chamber, or
heating it, but either way, the higher exhaust velocity means that the
exhaust will be *hotter*. And thus more visible.

Actually, it *is* practical for smaller craft. For larger craft, you
use more ammon or heavier weapons.

Sorry, but thermoelectric converters convert heat *differences* into
power. That is, you have a heat source and a heat *sink*. And *by
definition* "waste heat" is heat at the temperature of your *sink*.

The 3K background is the *eventual* sink. But as far as the *ship* is
concerned, the "sink" is the temperature of the radiating surfaces on
the hull. 

And you have to realize that temperature is *directly* related to
"watts radiated per square meter". The higher the W/m^2 the higher the
temp. 

Your thermoelectric converters would merely act as extra insulation,
which, by *slowing* the rate at which heat moves from inside the ship
to the outside *raises* the internal temperature. This is an
unavoidable consequence of the laws of thermodynamics.

I certainly think that such is a \'possibility\', but without some

If I use the 14 cubic meters rule, this works out to about 464 tons instead

Because they were TSR, the same company that tried to trademark the term
"Nazi", because it was used in their "Indiana Jones" RPG.  After all,
TSR stands for They Sue Regularly.  ;-)

That could work, too... or perhaps a combination.  I wouldn\'t like to tow a
bouy, it could give away my position, depending.
I could see taking out surface sensors as an important mission for Imperial
Marines.

I did, when I first subscribed, because I was using a spam-foiling

A PBM diplomacy game got a _lot_ of attention when one player sent a 
postcard with "attack on Liverpool agreed" to another, mind you it was at the 
height of the IRA bombings on the mainland.

Obtrav: how closely does the Imperium scan the X-mail?

FSotSI pg 6
"The primary activity a reserve fleet undertakes is training."
"Colonial squadrons are equipped with obsolescent (but still servicable,
rather than obsolete) ships and with personnel with somewhat less
training and experiance."
RS pg 27
"Reserve fleets are equipped with obsolescent - but still useful -
starships which have been retired from front-line Imperial service; they
are staffed by personnel serving in the Reserves (technically in the
service of the Imperium, but without the status of strict Imperial Navy
duty)."

I believe this implies that reserve and colonial units are not as well
equipped or trained as Regular fleets.

the 50-200 ship numbers do not specify if this is combatant only or
non-combatants and combatants.  I would say this is both combatants and
non-combatants, thus the average 31.25 combatants per fleet would be a
good number.

the larger numbers for ships in a squadron could be a hypathecical
maximum, i.e. that is what the Navy wants these squadrons to be equiped
to but the lower numbers are what is actually bought and payed for.  Or
a second posibility is that the CT era fleets also had escort and
destroyer squadrons and a reorganization eliminated these squadrons
(divided up and placed in the units they were to escort)

The navy has huge reserves at the depots, but Norris did not have access
to a depot.  also the Corridor depot has been depleted in the many
frontier wars.

Don\'t know if I\'ve posted this before; apologies to the list if so.  From a
long-unfinished Contact! article:


Contact! Romany

Location:  Anywhere in human space, but probably the bad section of a
run-down Class C or D starport.

Situation:  You are the purser of a merchant ship down on her luck. You are
desperately trying to find paying passengers to fill up her staterooms
before liftoff, when a shabbily but colorfully dressed man approaches you
and offers to make a deal. His son, he says, has married a beautiful girl
and they are very happy together.  Her family, however, has moved to a
neighboring system, and the girl is almost dead from missing them. Being
poor, he himself cannot afford two high passage tickets, or even two middle
passage tickets at standard rates. Low passage is out of the question:  it
is against their religion.  Besides -- what if only one of the young lovers
should survive? What he proposes is to pay for one middle passage ticket,
and then you let the couple both ride on it, double occupancy.

Action:  If you agree, a dozen or so of these brightly clad individuals
appear on your gangway, out of equally bright but shabby vans. These people
range in age from babies in arms to one great old grandmother, who presides
over the whole circus in a language you\'ve never heard before. You soon
lose count of the number of bags, boxes, children, animals ("pets", you are
told), and miscellania that are loaded into and out of the cabin, saying
goodbye, or going along as a last-minute gift. Finally, the hatch is closed
on those tearfully remaining behind with the vans.

Conflict:  Once in jumpspace, you have a moment to check on your two odd
passengers, who have not left their cabin since the voyage began.  They do
not wish to be disturbed, says the young man. Maybe it was the unusual
drain on the life support system, or maybe it was just a funny smell coming
from the cabin, but something leads you to get the captain and override the
lock in his presence. Inside are not two but seven of these people,
together with a number of their livestock. The women start a wailing that
sets your teeth on edge; the men come forward, both to offer some later
recompense (work, perhaps?) and to forestall any move on your part to
collect right now.  Any attempt at threats, physical force, or coersion
will be met with indifference, misdirection, counterthreats, or promises --
anything to keep you from acting until you reach your next port. By then,
it will probably be quite enough to simply be rid of them. Such is your
first encounter with Romany -- the Gypsies.

He didn\'t get to talk to him IIRC.  His meeting w/ the Emperor was in front of
everyone.  He comes down from the Sargon straight to the Assassination.  Yes.
In fact, Dulinor had scheduled a formal audience, which indicated there was a
very important and formal matter to be discussed.   Maybe he did that
specifically to make sure the real Strephon would be there (as well as giving
him the photo-op).  Strephon greets him, Dulinor bows and then plugs the
Imperial family.

The imposter was only supposed to be ceremonial.  A big bruhaha like Dulinor
arranged pretty much ensured the real Strephon would be there (if there hadn\'t
been a little event that required the Emperor\'s personal attention).  Besides,
the assassination had to be public and grandiose.

I get it as on the order of 2160 cubic meters, or 154.2 tons, considering it\'s only showing 1 deck.    The masurements I\'m using are 30 meters wide, 24 meters long, & 3 meters high, by direct measurement.  Remember, each square is about half a ton.

"A numbered fleet, depending on its mission, may have between two and 10
squadrons amounting to between 50 and 200 ships."  We\'re previously told a
squadron is 3-10 ships. Then the minimum 2 squadron fleet (of even the max of
10 ships/squadron) would only be 20 ships.  Only combatants are seemingly in
consideration for the purposes of this discussion.  The typical line squadron
has 4 or 5 ships.  If we put in the non-combatants, a 31.25 combatant ship
fleet will easily have 50 ships total.

Of course, Hans. : )  Just don\'t worship the numbers so much, and try to read
things in context.

It\'s clear that regular fleets are being alluded to.  Of the fleets, mentioned
as belonging to the Corridor Fleet, three of these are Fornast (A ,B, and E).
The 41st is in Zarushagar/A.  It seems to be an error.  Besides Corridor Fleet
has 16 numbered fleets (in 9 subsectors), not 4.  My bet is someone goofed.

It would be easy for me to assume this is one more error of which MT was
replete.  It\'s fortunate there might be another explanation (and/or excuse
<g>).  We know that the Imperial fleets were reorgnized after the Fifth
Frontier War.  I\'m assuming this is mentioned in original Traveller somewhere
(SMC/FFW?)... (It\'s mentioned in Regency Sourcebook).  The 1st Fleet which
fought in the Fifth Frontier War, defending the intersection of Jewell (B),
Regina (C), Villis (F), and Lanth (G) subsectors was redesignated the 315th
fleet after the war (and the 1st Fleet designation tranfered to fleet at
Core/G).

Your set of information isn\'t invalidated by FSotSI.  Squadrons *can* be that
large, they\'re just not typical.  Don\'t worry Hans, there\'s nothing wrong w/
being atypical. (Or even "Alternate" <g>).  : )

Not according to FSotSI.  The changes caused by the Rebellion are discussed,
but are limited to how the squadrons/fleets are designated.  Much of the info
is recycled from Rebellion.

Don\'t jump to conclusions.  I didn\'t like what *your* number-crunching put
out.  Fortunately for me, your system is uncanonical. : )

About you using your uncanonical assumptions and calculations to prove your
uncanonical points, ignoring the quite a bit of canon you\'ve taken far out of
context (possibly deliberately).

My view is that if the Imperium claims the space between the worlds, then
it had damn well better prove an ability to protect that space. Otherwise,
worlds will either question the neccessity of being part of the Imperium,
start arming themselves to protect their commercial interests, start
allying with each other to do the above, or think about signing up with a
state that will protect them. 

I also believe, but others disagree, that the IN will see routine
patrolling and anti-piracy sweeps as being excellent training for wartime. 

It also strikes me as sensible for the local commercial and financial
interests to ahhhh make sure the local Naval authorities understand the
neccessity of keeping a strong anti-piracy presence.

Even with no Imperial fleet whatsoever involved, a small amount of cash
(MCr 200 or so) can make life uncomfortable for the 99% of pirates who do
not have high-tech milSpec gear (OK, so bikies in Denmark have got hold of
LAWs, and a bloke in Sydney did borrow a M113 a while ago ... you *might*
get a naval frigate or destroyer stolen. And I like the idea of the navy of
some world continuing to fight the Counter-Revolution, and slowly drifting
into brigandage. But 99% of pirates are going to be using modified standard
ships, or Frontier Traders of one sort or another).

The rough breakdown is six MCr 20 fighters, six MCr 3 customs cutters, MCr
50 worth of sensor arrays and one heavily armoured nil maneuver asteroid as
a base.

The customs cutters are unarmed except for a couple of missiles or a fixed
one-shot combustion laser, and use TL13 Fusion plants running Heplar to
keep the cost down. Should be about MCr 3.

The idea is to push the \'minimum threshold\' for piracy above that which
most pirates can achieve. It is one thing to get hold of a Far Trader and
soup it up with a 2G Heplar rig taking up half the cargo bay, but it\'s
quite another to get a ship with MilSpec stealthing and MilSpec
counter-missile armament.

If you make pirates have MilSpec gear to challenge the mainworld\'s space,
then they will stick to chicken stealing among the belters and similar scum
in the Outsystem. 

As long as the brigands stick to the hills, and dont make a nuisance of
themselves to anyone important, then it isnt worth chasing them. If they
start sticking up stagecoaches outside the city gates, then we do something
about it.

I\'m not sure how to answer this, except to say that most people who want to

If you are in it for reasons of ideology, different story.

From my work on the Luriani:

"It was the possession of this maritime capacity which preserved the 
remarkable homogeneity of Luriani culture, despite being separated by 
thousands of kilometres of water, each Luriani settlement was connected by a 
web of voyaging ships. Indeed some Luriani lived out their entire lives at sea, 
only setting foot on land to gather supplies or build new ships"

"When Vilani influenced traders contacted the Luriani in -7500 they had 
advanced to a solid TL3. The Luriani were to prove to be extremely adept in 
absorbing Advanced technology; and by -7200 they had achieved TL9 and were 
launching their first "voyaging" ships to the stars. By -6000 they had 
established a vigorous interstellar culture encompassing most worlds within 10 
parsecs of their homeworld. However the Luriani never developed the idea of an 
interstellar state (much like they have never truly developed a worldspaning 
government) and their worlds remained a loose grouping closely bound only by 
their voyaging culture."

Does this fit?

2 TLs down sounds about right for \'obsolescent\'. Call it 80% skill-1 crew
and 20% skill-2.

Now, personally, I cant think of a better method of training than sending
the ship full of reservists and trainees (plus some people who know what
they are doing) to some backwater world to show the flag. Give em some
shore leave while they\'re there ... they joined the Navy Reserve to see the
subsector.

Something fairly simple while they are there, such as a sensor scanning
excersise and maybe a little pursuit and target plotting on any ships in
system sounds in order (\'This is IN Ship Cyss ... we are going active with
our fire control in ten ... please do not be alarmed ... this is only a
drill ... this is IN Ship Cyss ... we are going to match courses with you
.. please do not be alarmed, this is only a drill\').

I cant imagine a lot more effective ways of having an anti-piracy patrol
than by having a 20 kton cruiser, even an obsolescent one crewed by
reservists, in the system. Even if it is trying to find rocks at 100 000km
on two tries out of three.

You do realize that while in low berths your children will not age. 
Therefore you will not be able to get rid of them for a longer period of
time.  [Unless of course in YTU the Imperium defines age soley by
calender age & you are a heartless SOB & then you can take your newborn,
stick them in a low birth for 18 years & then abandon them on the next
planet with no fear of child abuse charges because they are legally an
adult.]

NP.  I figured as much.

Supp 6 only shows 1 deck of the shuttle.  I\'d assume the remainder of the 
volume is in tankage above & below the deck for the jump.  And figuring 14m3 
volume, divide 14 by 3, the answer by 1.5 (a ton is 1.5 x 3 meters in the 
plans), you get 3.1111 meters in height.  If you take a ton to be 13.5 m3, it 
works out to *exactly* 3 meters.  <grin>  Go figger.

At the risk of restarting the great encryption debate, I\'ve always assumed that 
the Imperium required all manufacturers of encryption software to put in a 
backdoor so that they can read it. Theoretically it requires a warrant signed by 
a Count or better to read private mail; but Imperial Intelligence has been known 
to play fast and loose on more than one occassion. Of course there\'s a thriving 
market in black market encryption, but use of an illegal encryption utility is an 
Imperial crime (punishable by 5-10 years imprisonment) and just to make sure 
the IISS random selects mail and runs the decryption key to check. Of course 
the IISS comms office doesn\'t read these randomly decrypted messages...

  Good point, but it seems to be an approach more suited to long range
(sector or two, exploratory or no) trade. So far it looks like the risks/
costs to an operating pirate ship still occur on an on-going basis (monthly/
quarterly/ whatever) with no obvious improvements in long-term profitability
(not counting upgrading/establishing a spy network as that would entail non-
trivial risks; attracting real attention would be a negative, of course).

  Potemkin probably had 300 or so crew, but was a somewhat confused
affair with a broader political element; mutinies in the English & 
Royal navies mostly had to do with pay. The High Seas Fleet could be
considered to have mutinied in refusing a suicidal engagement.

  OTOH, none of these really involved fully rejecting their homeland
and most mutinies didn\'t go very far at all. As a completely off the
wall rule of thumb keep it to a few score (believable in humans with
poor conditions/grievances and a few capable activists amongst the mob).
Social backgrounds will matter tremendously - IN ships may not worry
much because the crew has nothing but their oaths of service in common,
while a planetary SDB force relying on long-service professionals can
rely on people with deep roots in the community to keep things OK.

  Confiscation would seem very unlikely. A reliance on negotiable currency

Figure 600 tons.  That gives you 8400 m3.

I agree with Ian here. How can you claim to rule the space between worlds
if you make local forces deal with piracy by jump ships?

It is canon that the 3I uses a feudal form of government. I suggest that
those who think that members will provide their own security and still be
loyal tax paying members of the 3I have a look at early medival France. In
a fedual system if your overlord doesn\'t provide the security he\'s supposed
to you get yourself one who will (one way or another).

>I also believe, but others disagree, that the IN will see routine

It would certainly be good for keeping sensor operators sharp, and give
good practice for chasing commerce raiders. That\'s a point how good were
the 3I\'s anti-commerce efforts in the Frontier Wars - if they were poor
that could indicate a lack of anti-piracy effort, and conversely if they
were effective it could show that the IN spends time on anti-piracy duties
in peacetime.

Not only would a formal audience ensure that the real Strephon would be
there, but it would also mean that various dignataries, bodyguards and
guard units would be in predicable places, thus making planning the
assassination and take-over a whole lot easier. Of course things went off
the rails and he didn\'t get Varian or Lucan, etc, etc.

Trademark violation outright and Trademark Dilution.  Specifically, whats
called "sponsorship confusion."

TSR gave JG a license to market "AD&D" products.
JG owns the copyright in everything it makes, but uses the license only
according to the contract with TSR.
The copyright pass to Mayfair.
If Mayfair markets the original JG materials, its interfering with
TSR\'s trademark, _unless_ the original license gave JG\'s successors
a license (which would be very unusual).
Since licenses are contracts between two specific parties,
change the parties and the contract is dead (unless both parties
agree to keep the previous contract in place merely substituing
the parties - though its really a new contract).

Since TSR and Mayfair compete in the same market, if Mayfair
sold JG products with both the Mayfair and AD&D name on them,
it could appear to the consumer that AD&D were in business together,
i.e., that AD&D was sponsoring and/or supporting Mayfair\'s marketing
of AD&D products.

If this were the actual breakdown of events, Mayfair would have the
copyrights, but they would be unable to market them, so long as
AD&D is a going concern, and for some period of time after that.
This kind of tying up of rights isn\'t altogether uncommon.

AD&D was doing a good job of protecting its trademark.
If you don\'t police the market to prevent people from using
your marks without permission, you could lose your mark
altogether.  You either abandon it, acquiese to its use by others,
or it becomes generic.  Xerox fights tooth and nail to prevent
anyone from using "xerox" to mean "photocopy" in advertising.
Kleenex pretty much lost out, IIRC.  Coca-cola has full-time
agents that go into restaurants and bars, all over the world
and ask for "Coke."  If they get anything other than "Coca-Cola,"
ths stuff hits the fan and distributors and bottlers catch all hell.

Its the price of doing business.

  Confiscation would seem very unlikely. A reliance on negotiable currency
to the exclusion of more secure arrangements looks like yet another effort
to stack the deck so that pirates don\'t have to face harder facts.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
It\'s my thinking that the slow speed of communication between
financial institutions will create a need for negotiable currency, at
least to some extent. My original analysis did not include passengers
carrying bundles of MCr notes with them, though - while I believe that
no one will want to leave their homeworld without a reserve of ready cash
on hand, you shouldn\'t see anyone but a mad eccentric carrying
luggage full of KiloCredit notes. (Thurston Howell III in space!!!)

I\'ve been wondering, though, if Imperium-wide banking systems are
possible. Is there enough bandwidth on the X-Boat system, for example,
to support one? I mean one where I deposit my KCr in a branch office
of Hortalez et Cie on Core, and with the speed of X-Boat every branch
office knows that I made the deposit?

Take all my deposits and all my withdrawals, multiply that amount of
data by all the other banking sentients in the Imperium. Continually
update it, even though if the person is moving you\'ll have out-of-date
data moving through the system behind it\'s newer version - not a
version problem, but unneeded data that clogs the system. Eventually
get to the point where every single X-Boat is carrying several financial
data messages about every banking sentient in the Imperium. Will
there be any bandwidth left over for me to send a letter to my Aunt
Petunia?

Perhaps directed fund transfers are sent - "send MCr100 from account 
GHY675 on Core to account UYTR674 on Regina" - while general
broadcast messages are not - "Fred Soybun has Cr38 left in his
checking account." If this were the case, you\'d have a reason for
carrying more negotiable currency, especially dilettante nobles and
others who don\'t necessarily know (or want it known) where they
are going.

Uh-oh - are we resurrecting the Great Traveller Interstellar Credit Card

  Then they\'ve got to be trying fairly hard to design useless stuff. More
likely this is evidence that equilibrium piracy is not considered to be a
significant threat. However, in aid of ensuring that, let\'s design (using HG,
of course) the "Hippo" class tramp freighter ("Provincial Merchant" in ads).

                MP-B4212C2-090000-64003-0       MCr 856        2000 tons
        batteries bearing   1     11  1                            TL=12
                batteries   1     11  1                          Crew=20 
        Cargo=1227. Fuel=440. EP=40. Agility=1.

  The crew total ignores the +50% ratings for command staff (7 total!) as
this isn\'t a warship. The four section heads get full staterooms and the
others get halves. The overbuilding in the loadout runs an explicit ~50 MCr,
which is probably not too bad for the peace of mind, especially in the SM
where the dirty Zhos are wont to conduct drive by shootings en masse.

  Note that it comes in at almost half the cost of the "Rabid Poodle" class
1000 Dt SDB.

  I guess it\'s not worth suggesting that adding planetary bombardment
to a pirates standard bag of tricks might make them a higher priority
to exterminate?

  I guess only ships can mount lasers, too.

  If budget constraints aren\'t an issue; if debates are going to revolve
about security/control vessels always being in too limited availability
then omni-purpose SDB\'s are a gift to pirates. Just for fun then we can
consider some ways of completing the fitting out of a "Rabid Poodle" class
1000 Dt SDB:

  160 tons unused goes to +40 fuel (for lack of anything else to do with it),
20 ton magazine (250+ m^3 of missiles for three turrets!, 78 tons for internal
bays for a half-dozen 10 ton inspection boats or fighters*, 12 tons for a bay
for six troops (why? - fold up the bunks and it\'s a rec-room/pool hall!).

  * - intended for warfighting only to allow fighters to piggyback away from
the world if an enemy fleet takes control of the mainworld zone.

  FWIW, a couple of boat bays should provide a sufficient Volume to play
Grav-Ball in. IIRC, there\'s still 10 tons unused, too - perhaps there\'s
a basis for the Mk. Ib "Leaping Chihuahua" variant?

  OK, but if you\'re not using the ports, then your ship is really only
capable of generating revenue from piracy - no practical alternatives
exist (i.e., casual piracy combined with cargo haulage).

  Avoiding contact with security ships is _not_ always going to be at
the pirates option - unless he\'s over-equipped to a fairly ridiculous
degree, or the locals are too backward/poor/stupid to realize that they
have a problem.

  If a customs cutter or warship taps you for an inspection then what?
Whether you enter the 100-D limit and join the traffic stream is somewhat
irrelevant, as the authorities just might decide that ships losing money
waiting out past the line are worth observing more closely.

  I assume that no system will have enough ships to "stop(/board) everyone
immediately", nor do I believe that it would be necessary or desirable.
According to your economic case for piracy this a TU in which starships are
so well documented that stealing them is undesirable, but the authorities
will never have a useful current list of extant shipping?

  In any case, let\'s say that the authorities only want to search 2-5%
of ships in space, and will search the others at the starport (if at all);
this still represents up to a 4 or 5% chance of being terminated with
each visit to a major system - which is attrition with a vengeance, and
discounts the authorities noticing that you never land even if not
challenged.

  You do realize that all of this is occurring, by definition (inside

(depending on which Trav edition/rules, anyway) of some elements?

  Neat fiction, but it seems unlikely that only the IN produces competent
personnel (OC, where do passed over officers drop out to?). Again, the
use of _very_ expensive (the boat I posted last week was MCr 1400+!) 
warships for routine and possibly unnecessary inspections (when a MCr 14
luanch from S:7 would do) looks like a deliberate step to make piracy
seem more practical.

That\'s how I do it IMTU.  Somebody needing cash on the other end can send money either by Xboat or by mail on a subbie to be placed in a draw account.  The transfer is bundled up with a copy of the owner\'s ID, the key code of a smart card, and the answers to some random questions designed to help prove their identity.   All they have to do is show up at the bank\'s branch with their ID, the smart card, and answer some random questions to prove their identity and the draw account is converted to a regular checking/debit account.

If there isn\'t a branch of their bank on the destination world, their bank sets up the draw account with a bank of the player\'s choosing.

  I think (I\'ll try to work it out eventually) that you\'re really over-
estimating the utility of a cold gas thruster. In any case, you\'re
assuming that you can go in close enough for gravity braking to do
lots of good - and in fact drift right past the planet - and no one

and if so under what rules?

  Unless the crews are pirates, I suspect. One guy watching the boards

the pong level?

  Time to contact? Defenses? Fifty missile launch tubes! Needless to

and SDB armour should stop chem-lasers, unless I\'m mistaken. Or are
lots of them nukes?

  Pirate bases can build starships? Doesn\'t that make them equivalent
to A starports, which cost "20 years of planetary income"? Wouldn\'t
an Imperial shipyard make notes on building a purpose-built pirate or
small warship (or heck, the 3I could require such papers). Wouldn\'t
a foreign state tend to be wary of building hornets to release into
others habitations (the Alabama (?) comes to mind).

  Oh, and who paid for them, and why?

  With a Jump unit it a week; with spares in magazines (or dumps) it
probably is do-able, especially as w/o thruster cut-offs it\'s not that
long a cruise; and apparently pirates don\'t require maintenance to any
real degree, according to some of the posts in the last month.

Put a bigger powerplant in it and the biggest computer you can find, then 
mount dual fusion guns in half the turrets.  Crank up fuel to match, drop down 
to 2 40 ton pinnaces and double the \'stateroom\' space for long range crews.  
And remember, these boats are gonna be out there for six months at a time, so

  I guess it\'s not worth suggesting that adding planetary bombardment
to a pirates standard bag of tricks might make them a higher priority
to exterminate?

I don\'t see pirates planning on large-scale terrorist attacks, but
it\'s not always predictable what a pirate captain will do when
everything is going wrong. Running with a major price on your
head maybe better than dying by the rules.

Interesting tightrope one must walk to be a pirate. Scary enough
to cow a merchant captain, but not scary enough to send the
governor calling for the IN. Effective enough to make a profit,
minor enough not to be worth the while of a light cruiser. Bold
enough to take a prize, patient enough to wait for that sliver of
perfect time when a prize can be taken without too much chance
of loss..

Well the lack of a clear line of succession (caused by Lucan\'s suspected
involvement w/ his brothers death) gave the excuses for there to be multiple
claims.  Also read the quote from Norris\' book in the titlepage of the MT
Ref\'s Manual titled "The Last Days of the Imperium."  Pretty much sums up my
argument. ; )  How could I ever be more eloquent than the First Regent? lol

Hmm... sounds reasonable.  Though, where have two of these been present at one

That\'s Strephon\'s take in the beginning of Survival Margin.  Course, in the
same place he indentifies a severe local myopia that is just wanting to spin
the Imperium off into sector sized areas. (SM pg 6).

I\'m referring to the Empress Wave and Longbow.  Avery.  The Zho Core
Expeditions.  The Ithklur and their struggle for freedom against the Hivers
and their manipulations.  All of these were tied together under large story
arcs in a Babylon 5 type fashion.   Polities rising and falling from power
instead of the stable and steady state enviornment we see in original
Traveller.  The Imperium, 1100 years old.  The Hive Federation... thousands of
years old.  The Two Thousand Worlds... thousands of years old.  The Aslan
Hierate, the new boys on the block... thousands of years old.  What\'s the
oldest continuously running government today,on Earth?  A couple of hundred
years old?

They might well be possible in G:T, I just don\'t expect it.  I\'m aware of no
game company that has really done it.  Maybe Star Wars and their New Republic
setting, but that was driven more by the novels and their authors...  GDW was
*going* to do it w/ TNE,but died before we got anything but prologue.  DGP
*might* have been trying to do it, but it\'s not clear beyond their continually
running story in TD and MTJ.

SJG has had a tendency towards not leaving loose ends in essentially one
product support.  I know there\'s In Nomine, etc, and that G:T is obviously
going to be more than one product, but I believe it\'s been confirmed there
will be no overall plotline for the background of G:T\'s alternate universe...
Course, i\'d be happy to learn i\'m wrong.

Maybe you mean the Reformation Coalition rather than TNE in general.  The
Regency (and the Hubworlds) certainly had different views on the Imperium than
the Reformation Coalition, as did the Covenant of Sufren.  The Regency
certainly glorifies and looks fondly to the Third Imperium.  All of Charted
Space would have a certain reaction to the Collapse, seeing how it resulted in
Virus and the Collapse.

No one necessarily thought that, that I can see.  It was teh opinion of many
in the RC that there was a creepy morality to the pragmatism of the Third
Imperium that had many facets.  The hands-off attitude towards the governments
of Imperial member-worlds w/ quite repugnant governments.  The attitudes
towards cloning and clones.  Especially if M:0 portrays the early Imperium,
it\'s crass and hideous desire for the credit at the expense of more important
things.  Especially in the way that the Imperium destroyed itself, killing
billions of its own citizens even before Virus.

> together is the "example" of the Imperium and the fact
> that the wilds are howling around them on all sides.

Doubtful.  Especially if M:0 portrayed things as they really went.  The RC has
a cause to reclaim the Wilds to the extent of the former imperial boundaries
and w/ a philsophy quite unlike that of the Imperium and far closer to what
Dulinor (more accurately probably the Reform Solomani) would have wanted.

Exactly!  There are a number of issues within the Coalition (Centrist vs
Federalist, Schalli and the Humanist Right, Feudal Technocracies vs the more
democratic philosophies, amongst others) that were going to have to be
resolved if the Coalition was to survive.  They were tabled and put aside
while the initial expansion proceeded.  It makes the Coalition vibrant and
alive and not black/white like critics of the RC like the paint it.  Derek
Stanley (?) has an excellent CINET article in his Coalinfonet project on
remnants and the "Garvey Society" that intended to leave the coalition for a
world in Alpha Leonis.  There was a larger association of Coalition remnants
that opposed the move.  The Coalition was essentially the Solomani
Confederation, minus the totalitarian government and the racist tone (though
that was present from the Humanist Right).

mmm... i read "has thus far deployed the ships in over-sized squadrons of ten
to twenty vessels, and has committed them to operations only with the Navy\'s
major battle fleets."
The spread is important IMO.  One, it gives flexibility and two, the enemy
doens\'t know exactly how many ships you\'ll putting on him (and would have to
gamble on the max).  This would result in alot of strategic shuffling, etc.
The Imperium and it\'s fleets do not have the ships to put all of it\'s
squadrons at max size, but they have enough to optimize x number of squadrons
and keep their enemies on their toes (even assuming all sides equal).

> CE (Gazelle)  "Hundreds"

Supplement 5 is clear that 92 FI\'s were constructed out of an order of 100.  8
hull numbers were canceled.  There were only 28 CF\'s.  Only 15 survived to
1107.  I see nothing about the number of Lightings in Supp 9.

I don\'t know... First Survey  would be pretty hard to beat.  : )
As Rupert has pointed out, the errors are confined to the ship designs
themselves, rather than the theory and discussion of the Imperial Navy.

Mmm...  this is a nit, but both those ships have BB as their designation
inside Fighting Ships, Dreadnaught simply referring to the mainline BBs.

This would ignore the explicit word in Fighting Ships, pg 9 that says CruRons
are 4-8 ships.  BBs would, if anything, average similar or smaller, not
larger.  The examples we have are hardly representative.  The mentions of
those two ships being in squadrons of 8 would fit the optimum (read: maximum)
number, doing all their propaganda justice.  ; )

Sounds pretty good, though i\'d add spreads in there (and put your numbers at
the top end, too).  Even if just for some flexibility.

BatRons are going to be enormously unnecessary in the Imperial core.  Only on
the fringes would they be necessary at all, though maybe in numbers out of
proportion than the imperial core *would* have.

What would be the purpose of a DesRon for the IN?  Destroyers (the Midu
explicitly) are supposed to be ecorts for cruisers and battleships.  Maybe for
small-time flag waving missions to impress inferior TL worlds.  Power
projection, but not actual presence.

  The fusers didn\'t fit the EP profile real well, plus I didn\'t want
to munchkinize the thing too much - the sand wouldn\'t be much use in
a shooting war but it should limit repair bills in anti-piracy ops.
To really finesse the HG rules there\'d be another weapon class to soak
up weapon-1 (which requires nukes to inflict in HG!) hits.

  Fuel is already 8-12 months at stand-by (TCS); the magazine is more
stores than anything else, really - not that six months supplies for
20 solitaire experts is going to be more than a ton. FWIW, not that
humans can\'t take long cruises (historically many _much_ longer than
the ones that concern the TML) but both the empty ship bays and troop
bay might be very popular spaces.

  Hmm, Grav-Ball: 3rd SDB Wing vs High Port Marine Detachment?

My economic analysis didn\'t include any revenues from trade. If your

Finding a system that has enough cargo to hunt, that is also backward,

way for long. They either lose the trade (nothing to hunt anymore),
get enough trade revenues to arm themselves, or get smart enough
to call for help real quick.

I\'m postulating some time between entering the system and
encountering the patrol forces, this is the window the pirate has
to act (to attack or flee) within.

According to your economic case for piracy this a TU in which starships are

will never have a useful current list of extant shipping?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I\'m postulating that you can give them a transponder that will take some
time to check, and that such a transponder will not be too unusual.
This comes from the earlier transponder debates - the idea that if the
authorities encounter a transponder code they haven\'t heard of before,
they\'ll record it and watch for verification to show up (days or weeks
later) rather than seize the ship immediately - tracking ships by
keeping records and distributing seize-under-suspicion lists, rather
than hold every ship with a transponder code you haven\'t been
informed of yet. The pirate in this case isn\'t ever going to use this
particular code again, so isn\'t really concerned about it being on
a seize list.

Steven again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  In any case, let\'s say that the authorities only want to search 2-5%
of ships in space, and will search the others at the starport (if at all);
this still represents up to a 4 or 5% chance of being terminated with
each visit to a major system - which is attrition with a vengeance, and
discounts the authorities noticing that you never land even if not
challenged.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
You weren\'t planning on hanging around. If a patrol ship starts vectoring
towards you, you run for it - even jumping out at under 100-D if you
have to (owch). Long sensor ranges don\'t have to help only the good
guys, you should know that the customs vessel is coming your
way quite a while before he can shoot at you effectively.

Steven again:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  Neat fiction, but it seems unlikely that only the IN produces competent
personnel (OC, where do passed over officers drop out to?). Again, the
use of _very_ expensive (the boat I posted last week was MCr 1400+!) 
warships for routine and possibly unnecessary inspections (when a MCr 14
luanch from S:7 would do) looks like a deliberate step to make piracy
seem more practical.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I always figured that if they were good at their jobs, they wouldn\'t
be stuck on customs inspection duty. ;)

I don\'t see MC1400+ SDB\'s assigned to customs inspections. I was
more thinking 400tn dragons and such...if you are planning on using
a MCr14 Launch for inspection work, you\'d best have some heavier
units on hand because that Launch will do nothing to stop a Corsair
except die noisily enough to get the attention of the rest of your
defense flotilla.

If the pirate is playing footsie with more than one or two patrol craft,
he ought not be there in the first place. The success of the pirate is
going to depend on finding systems where patrol assets cannot handle
incoming traffic properly, for whatever reason - finances, incompetence,
units pulled out-system for wartime duty, whatever.

You can easily equip a system to the point where the pirate will
not succeed. No U-Boat during WWII could possibly have penetrated
Scapa Flow either. <G>

I did figure that a pirate could probably take only one or two ships
in an entire year\'s cruise and make a profit, thus a long transit from
a law level zero class A or B starport to a chosen hunting area was
doable. More ships taken on that cruise would simply equal more
profits, or a faster amortization of the value of the corsair ship.

OK. Here goes. Missile first, then we demonstrate how to modify it into a
customs launch (\'Get one auditor. Dice finely. Jam into warhead space\').

*********************************************************************

Famile Spofulam TL13 Standard Anti-Shipping Missile

1.633 m3 Adv Comp Lam (17.963t, KCr 13)

500 kkm TL12 Laser Commo (0.028 m3, 0.056t, KCr 56)

3 MW Fusion Plant (1m3, 3t, KCr 400)

3 MW TL 13 batteries (1.5 m3, 3.55t, KCr 12 - 56 mins output)

1200 kN HEPLAR engine (0.6 m3, 0.6 t, KCr 6)

4 hrs Heplar Fuel (3.6 m3, 0.3t)

400 MJ X-ray Laser (0.472 m3, 0.472t, KCr 48)

TL12 50 kkm Beam Pointer (2.667 m3, 2.667t, KCr 267)

1 shot/min evacuator (0.092 m3, 0.092t, KCr 46)

300 kg one-shot cartridge (0.3 m3, 0.3t, KCr 15) (assumes laser cartriges
cost Cr 25/MJ)

The whole thing costs KCr 688, masses 30 ton, and turns into a nice 11.2 m3
sphere (0.7 dtons, 2.78 m diameter) and pulls 4.0 gees for 2 hours. It has
Armour Factor 87, and is completely reliant on targeting from the mother
ship, having no integral sensors.

**********************************************************

OK. So we need to turn this into a Customs Launch. We have, IMO, up to 30
tons of mass to play with, and plenty of armour.

Inflate the beach ball shape to be 6 dtons (84 m3). The armour falls from
AF 87 to AF 22 (dont get shot at) (*Cue Ditzie Stage Left with massive air
pump*). 72 m3 to play with, to go with the 30t.

Add a TL12 Sens 12.5 PEMS (0.1 m3, 0.1t, KCr 500) (*Sounds of hammering*).

Add 2 TL12 CM 0.8/CP 1.25 Computers (0.04 m3, 0.008t, KCr 2) (*Sounds of
high-pitched whining about not being able to doooooooo anything*)

2 Workstations (14m3, 0.4t, KCr 5)

2 Bunks (28 m3, 1 t, KCr 2) <Mass includes 1 auditor and 1 beefy Marine
type *Can Iiiiiiii take the Marine-weeeeeeeny home wiiiith me ????*>

4 G Compensation (0.5 m3,0.25 t, KCr 25) <*But the mariiiiiine doesnt want
to play graaaav pong*>

Type III LS (0.4 m3, 0.4 t, KCr 30)

Extra 16 hours HFuel (14 m3, 1.0 t)

Standard airlock (3 m3, 0.2 t, KCr 5)

Sanitary Facility (3.5 m3, 0.2, KCr 1)

Extra 1.5 MW power (0.5 m3, 1.5t, KCr 100)

Total mass is therefore 34.3 t, total cost is KCr 758 - call it a round KCr
760 including some nice chairs and fuzzy dice. It is capable of 3.5 gees
for 20 hours.

Under normal operations, the Cutter will pull 2 Gees, as the full 3.5 gees
requires use of battery power.

Note that the small size of fusion plants at TL13 allows the use of cheaper
Heplar, rather than expensive T-plates.

Whilst technically capable of up to 2 weeks life support, most trips will
be a lot shorter. The pilot and gunner usually share one bunk, with the
marine and auditor sharing the other.

You could build a cargo version by eliminating the 2 bunks, and having 28
m3 of cargo space.

It\'s a lot cheaper than ships boats under previous Traveller design rules ...
taking the laser out cuts the cost by KCr 350, if you are really cheap.
