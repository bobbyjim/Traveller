So? Admiral Doenitz tried defending himself against charges based on
his use of unrestricted submarine warfare by pointing out that the US
had done the same thing in the Pacific.

If he couldn\'t get away with that, do you think the Soviets would have
let a detail like yours get in the way?

For various *good* reasons, the only time that you take a *vote* in the
military is during a courts martial. Commanders have been relieved of
command when headquarters found out that they had let their menm vote
on something rather than deciding for them. 

Among other things, voting takes *time*.

Then you get the orders in writing and put your objections in writing.
That will cover you when the military court starts looking for blood.

I suggest you discuss the above with the Carthaginians.

I have no idea which side was "right" in the Punic Wars. But one side
*no longer exists*. 

So in *that* sense, if no other, violence *can* "solve" a problem.

You also assume that "your" family, friends, etc *will* want revenge
and that others *will* take up your cause. Possibly. But history is
full of examples of people deciding "they got what they deserved". 

*Counting* on your being considered a martyr is foolish.

I agree on that. But that has little to do with the *conduct* of the
war. It has a lot to do with a desire for revenge.

*After* the war. During the war, and even *before* it, "retaliation"
and the *threat* of force are quite useful.

Compare the methods and results in two historical incidents:

1. Hitler "annexing" the Sudentenland.
2. Saddam Hussein "annexing" Kuwait.

In the former, rather than use force, the annexation was accepted. In
the latter, the annexation was *forcibly* reversed. Alas, the follow
thru was insufficient, as Saddam *still* doesn\'t "get" the idea that he
is *not* allowed to prepare to attack his neighbors. Nor does he seem
to recall that he got a ceasefire (*not* "peace") by agreeing to the
terms he now refuses to honor. :-(

1MT = 4.14 * 10^15 MJ I\'ve also seen 4.2)

The problem here is that you can\'t just accelerate the rock, you have to
change its orbital velocity.  I haven\'t done these calc.  The navy\'s
PostGrad school did, so I can\'t really speak with any more authority on
the matter.    BTW, deadeye is my twin brother.

I guess the real problem is that we cannot accerate much of anything
today, and it really wasn\'t a cananonical tactic for the employment of
starships in either CT or MT.

Ek=0.5*m*v*v  You forgot to divide by two, this also gives energy in
Joules, not kN.

IIRC 1 Kg of TNT gives 4.186*10^6 J

I get a Ek of 2.592*10^16, which when divided by 4.186*10^9 (energy per ton
on TNT) gives 6192068 tons of TNT, or about 6 Megatons.

The maths worked out the same for me :) If you put the numbers into TNE you
get a Dam of 1D6-1, the same as a .22 Long Rifle. Now the .22LR has been
used to kill an elephant with one shot, but I don\'t think you could do that
with one rock of that size. 

I suspect that rocks are dangerous for their energy because of their
relatively high momentum. This same high momentum/low energy compared to a
.22LR is why I don\'t think a rock would work on an elephant (poor
penetration).

I dunno.  I remember reading a good number of articles in mainstream American
magazines (TIME being one I remember pretty clearly) within the last two years
that lead me to believe that Christianity is growing by leaps and bounds in
the U.S.  The Catholic Church is losing ground in a big way, but the more
liberal churches of other sects are gaining quite a number of followers.  And
the fundamentalists grow alarmingly each year (and have been for quite a few
years).

This is my last statement on this, because I don\'t have the magazines in
question.

Obviously they have a concept of Jump...  They use it from day to day.  The
impression I\'ve always got is that nobody really understands what J-Space
itself is, why it causes insanity, why some people have jump intolerance...
Etc...  They know how to punch in and punch out of J-Space, but have very
little understanding of J-Space itself.

I wouldn\'t imagine a state religion of the 3I, nor did I say that there was.
I also don\'t believe that there is an officially endorsed religion in the 3I
(kind of redundant).

But, religion is probably on a much larger scale then you seem to think.  The
most populous planet in the subsector that I rolled up randomly has something
like 50+ billion people.  The highest population in the entire subsector, and
the highest percentage of the population in the subsector (I think all of the
other planets added up equal less then a quarter of that population).  And, it
turned out to be a religious dictatorship.  That\'s a common thing.  The higher
the population, the better the chances of a religious dictatorship, at least
according to the current rules.

**History**
The Luriani are a Human minor race transported to their new home by the
mysterious Ancients some 300,000 years ago. Whilst the Luriani are
unmistakably Human they have several unique and distinct characteristics
which are a result of both natural evolution and genetic tampering by the
Ancinets. The Luriani are often referred to as "aquatic" Humans. This is
not strictly true, for although they are far more at home in a water
environment than most Humans these adaptations do not go as far as the
Solomani geenered Scanians. Luriani have distinctively webbed hands and
feet (and the Luriani toes take up a far greater proportion of the feet);
certain fat cells have the ability to store oxygen which allows the Luriani
to remain submerged for up to 15 minutes and reach depths of up to 500
metres without any artificial assistance; they possess a clear second eyelid
under the first which greatly enchances their vision underwater. However
perhaps their most striking modification is not readily apparent at all.
Unlike virtually all other Human races, the Luriani are overwhelmingly right
brain dominant and their language abiity is located in the centre of the
brain which normally deals with singing rather than the classic speach
centres. It would appear that these modifications were introduced to enable
the Luriani to function better in a three dimensional environment, this has
lead to further speculation that the Ancients intended to make the Luriani
fully aquatic but the Final War intervined, leaving the Luriani "unfinished".
As a result of these modifications the Luriani are overwhelmingly (at least
93%) lefthanded, intensily creative and artistic, and have a strong tendancy
towards music.

Derri (the Luriani homeworld) is officially classified as a waterworld, with
only 5% of its surface being land. However this is still 19.7 million km2.
Derri is a fairly normal world with eleven continental plates, but these are
mostly below sea level. Thus Derri is covered by a large number of continental
sized island archipelagos surrounded by shallow (250m to 400m) seas. These
"continents" are surrounded by deep (2000m to 5000m) oceans. It would appear
that the Ancients initially deposited the Luriani on several islands in one
of these archipelagos.

The semi-aquatic nature of the Luriani enabled them to utilise the shallow
seas around their island homes for hunting and gathering, thus allowing for
far greater populations and development than might have otherwise been
expected. However eventually the restricted nature of their island homes
started to limit their development. It was these growing pressures that lead
to the development of seafaring on Derri far before the Luriani had even
developed anything even remotely like civilisation (it is theorised that the
creative nature of the Luriani brain played a crutial role in this). Thus
in approximately -250,000 the Luriani developed seagoing vessels whilst they
were still a primitive hunter gatherer society. By -150,000 the Luriani
had developed oceangoing vessels capable of circumnavigating their entire
world despite still possessing only a TL0 culture. It was the possestion of
this maritime capacity which preserved the remarkable homogenity of Luriani
culture, despite being seperated by thousands of kilometres of water, each
Luriani settlement was connected by a web of voyaging ships. Indeed some
Luriani lived out thier entire lives at sea, only setting foot on land to
gather supplies or build new ships.

Given this voyaging culture it was only natural that the Luriani should
quickly come to the concept of trade and commerce, thus giving rise to the
first signs of Luriani civilisation. By -100,000 the Luriani had developed
a thriving world spanning barter economy, with the huge nomadic voyaging
ships travelling between islands, trading for goods and services. However
with the rise of trade came the rise of piracy and warfare. Both the
seagoing nomads and the island dwelling settlements found a need for
fighters to defend against the depredations of raiders, which would
eventually evolve into the Luriani warrior class. Thus by -30,000 the
Luriani had established a world spanning trading civilisation complete with
orgainised warfare, despite the fact that they were still a TL0 hunter
gatherer culture without any domesticated animals or form of agriculture.

Over the next 23,000 years the Luriani gradually improved their technology
and culture. In around -28,000 the first signs of agriculture appeared on
a number of islands, animals were domesticated around -25,000, metalworking
was achieved around -15,000. When Vilani influenced traders contacted the
Luriani in -7500 they had advanced to a solid TL3. The Luriani were to
prove to be extremely adept in absorbing Vilani technology; and by -7200
they had achieved TL9 and were launching their first "voyaging" ships to the
stars. By -6000 they had established a vigourous interstellar culture
encompassing most worlds within 10 parsecs of Derri. However the Luriani
never developed the idea of an interstellar state (much like they have never
truely developed a worldspaning government) and their worlds remained a
loose grouping closely bound only by their voyaging culture. However this
situation was not to remain.

In -5400 the Vilani began the Consolidation Wars. Intially the Vilani
ignored the Luriani, regarding their independent worlds as a lesser threat
than the many organised interstellar states that they faced. This was to
prove to be a miscalculation on the Vilani\'s part. When in -4900 the Vilani
attempted to conquer the Luriani worlds they found themselves opposed by a
coalition of all the Luriani worlds. The initial Vilani offensive was turned
back with heavy losses. However the Vilani returned in greater strength and
thus began the Luriani Campaigns. The Luriani were to prove to be formidable
opponents for the Vilani. The nature of their brains made three dimensional
combat second nature to the Luriani and their warrior class were very efficent
fighters. however eventually the superior economic weight of the Vilani
began to tell and one by one the Luriani worlds fell to the advancing
Vilani fleets; and in -4500 Derri fell and the Luriani were defeated and 
despite several revolts were to remain under Vilani rule until the comming
of the Solomani in -2200

In Germany, we were told in basic just to say "No!". Some orders may not

Actually, you can wind up needing 3D if there are only *three* ships.
While three points define a plane, the *vectors* may not be coplanar.
With two ships, you *can* define a plane that\'ll hold both ships, by
"defining" one of them as being "at rest". Then the manuevers work out
ok. 

But if the local star or planets are of any interest than you need 3d
when you have *two* ships, as they can have course relative to the
planet/star that are skew lines.

Quick example of "skew" lines. Set up a line running north to south. A
foot *above* a point on this line, have a line running east-west (or
even at any angle other than 0 or 180 to the nort-south line). These
lines are *not* co-planar, nor do they ever meet. Mathematicians call
this being "skew" or skewed.

If you pick a frame where one ship is at rest, you\'ve reduced that line
segment (vector) to a *point*. And a line and a point not on thaty line
define a plane. 

Add in a third ship, and unless it\'s course is restricted to this plane
you\'ve defined, you are back to needing three dimensions.

3-D combat definitely calls for the *square* XY and XZ grids, plus a
lot of D^2 = X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 type calcs.

That last should be Ek = .5*m*v*v.

Assuming your mass figure is correct I get about 27 EJ (27e15 Joules).
I think you forgot to convert tonnes to kg, and km/sec to m/sec.

4.2e9 Joules = 1 ton of TNT

So that asteroid is roughly equivalent to a 6 megaton bomb.

Hmm. Yes. But my original problem - the hypothetical \'you\' remains solved. 

The others are new problems which may or may not appear. I can alos solve
those problems by applying Massive Violence (tm)

Ask Napoleon about this - most of his campaigns were attempts to shove
present problems back into the future and no, violence did not work for him
in the long run. But the Allies removed him BY VIOLENCE, and the problem
stayed solved. 

I didn\'t say violence was the perfect or desirable solution, merely that it
sometimes does solve problems. 

But we\'re wandering around non-topic land here. Can we wrap up with me
saying that I more or less agree - violence often breeds more problems than
it solves. 

But sometimes it\'s the only solution available in this stupid world of
ours.

You may be thinking of denatured alcohol, which is that way for the sole
purpose that it\'s toxic to drink.

Making anhydrous ethanol is simple and cheap (the taxes are actually a
major portion of the cost...we used to get it in pint bottles with little
tax stamps like any other kind of liquor) Keeping it that way is only
a little harder. It\'s is also no more toxic that Everclear (or less toxic
for that matter) One lab in our department has an annual christmas party
called the Purple Jesus party with a wicked punch made from the stuff .
The name derives from an apocryphal tale of one post doc who after
consuming a generous quantity wandered on off home, and allegedly had a
rather hallucinatory encounter with a large purple plastic dashboard icon.

Actually, all it takes to keep it anhydrous is dumping some molecular
sieve into it, and keeping it scrupulously closed in an airtight
container, flushed with dry nitrogen when opened. 

Calcium chloride will work almost as well as molecular sieve. I don\'t know
what the composition of molecular sieve is..it\'s some very hygroscopic
material bound up in small beads that absorbs a goodly chunk of it\'s
weight in water. It is a drying agent similar to calcium chloride with the
advantages that it doesn\'t clump up and form solid masses when it gets
wet. Also it can be regenerated by putting it in an oven. 

Aldrich sells it, we used to use it all the time to keep reagents free
of water.

There\'s another material called Dri-Rite, sold by a number of companies
that does the same thing.

AFAIK, there are none. There is sector information available, such as that
at ftp.mpgn.com, but it is data for the Rebellion, ca. 1116, not post
Virus.

You\'ll have to \'collapse\' your own. I have a BASIC program on my web site
that does it according to the rules in TNE. it\'s at

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~bjohnson/tprogs.html

I know it runs under qbasic from DOS 6.02. Translations to other
platforms/languages would be relatively simple.

agreement between (major) combatants. It maps well to cold war
conflicts this century.  The idea is to stay just shy of the cutoff
that will escalate the war as a whole to the point where all the
worlds on the front are totally destroyed.

There is also the goal of the conflict to consider. What good is it 
to lay waste to a planet that you want (with population) intact? 

Just thought that we could focus this energy on traveller.

Hey, thinking about Iraq brought this to mind (combined with the
whole nuking Japan issue).

If bombing population centers is wrong by any agreed upon rules of
war (in traveller) then is it equally abhorent to put *any* military
facility or any military related industry in a civilian area? I
would say yes. You can\'t have it both ways.

If you want to keep you cities from getting bombed, you have a 
responsibility to not force the enemy to regard your cities as 
targets. I\'d define "civilian area" as an area well outside the CEP 
of any weapon pointed at the military target. Anything else is a
target if for no reason other than probability.

You\'d have to have all factories, etc. a few miles from town, more
or less.

Something to think about. The Japanese, for example, had a large
amount of military work being done in homes. Gun receivers, for
example. Parts were brought home, and returned to the factory
as sub-assemblies.  No doubt the best place to look for CBN
facilities in Iraq will be right in the city since they might feel
we\'ll pull punces to avoid collateral damage. That is asking for it,
IMO.

While I agree with your comment that a lot of T4 stuff is good, I\'m a little

Erm, I don\'t think nuking Baghdad was ever seriously considered, except as 
a possible response to an NBC attack. The reason the attack stopped was 
because the job was over - liberating Kuwait was the *only* objective 
authorised by the UN.

First of all, the average TL is *not* 12, it\'s 7-8 (ie Earth today). A 
hostile atmosphere gives you a +1, but even then you\'re only looking at 
8-9, which isn\'t much against a TL12 ship.

Yes, against a well-defended world a DD wouldn\'t last 5 minutes, but the 
sort of worlds I\'m talking about won\'t *be* well-defended.

	The Geneva convention explicitly recognizes this. It defines unlawful
targets, such as schools, hospitals, religious centers and cultural places.
But if you use *any* unlawful target for military purposes, you forfeit its
status as a protected item, and it becomes a lawful and appropriate target
for military action. Use an ambulance to transport troops to the front, and
all ambulances are now fair game. Station your troops in a church, and
expect to get it bombed. Fire on enemy troops from a hospital window, and
expect retaliation.

	The whole idea behind the Laws of Armed Conflict was to agree on what
would be permissible, so you can rely on your enemy to do the same. You
treat POWs right, and hope the enemy does the same.

US prices very easily ... how would that suit TMLers in

can hardly wait.

THat is true, and the 4000 dead we were supposed to get taking out the
remaining 8-14 Republican Guard divisions around Bahgdad.  That were
fortified and had no place to run to.

It was a gamble that shithead would be ousted and we lost.  So what? 
Were not going to invade now anyway.

True.  We get breifed on and are expected to enforce these laws as
officers.  The idea is that you start the war with all the "laws" in
force and as one side or the other decides to violate you reciprocate.

Easy to do when you have the upper hand in a conflict, but what happens
if you cant spare resources to maintain prisoners and you know they will
rearm and try to kill you as soon as you release/stop watching them?

The problem is that he who wins...wins.  Don\'t be unfortunate enough to
lose.

Errr, would you care to expand on the lethality of a .22LR vs. an elephant?
I\'m sorry but the ballistics behind the .22LR make it difficult enough to
even penetrate the elephant\'s thick skin, let alone a one shot kill (hell,
a .357 magnum will "bounce" off an elephant\'s skull).

I meant more broadly. If you put an ammo dump *next* to a school,
for example. The letter of the convention is not broken, but there
has to be (IMO) some thought to the reality of conflict.

If you put an installation in a city (anyplace) and defend it (AAA,
SAMs, whatever) then you increase the chances that the enemy who is
honestly just trying to wreak the military target, will hit buildings
around it.

Yeah. I\'d think that in a world where 1 ton bombs are typical
weapons the rules should be written to include their use. In other
words don\'t make laws that don\'t make sense.

So you\'d say that it is unlawful within the convention to put a
military installation, or a military factory in an area with a
population density greater than X people/km^2.  The law then states
that "all military targets and factories are viable targets."

If you want to put a AAA battery on the roof of a hospital, go
ahaead, but bombing it is just fine.

I think that was the second or third grenade he\'d thrown back. After losing his 
right hand, he was forced to fire his rifle with his left, which he continued 
doing until reinforcements arrived 3 hours later. He won a VC for that, and 
AFAIK he\'s still alive today.

Well I certainly wouldn\'t want them as my enemy!

Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Protocol I:

Article 51, paragraph 4

Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are:

a) those which are not aimed at a specific military objective;
b) those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed
at a specific military objective; or
c) those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which
cannot be limited as required by this Protocol;

and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military
objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.

Article 51, paragraph 5

Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as
indiscriminate:

a) an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a
single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct
military objectives located in [a populated civilian area].
b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian
life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination
thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct
military advantage anticipated.

Article 51, paragraph 6

Attacks against the civilian population by way of reprisals are prohibited.

Protocol I was negotiated between 1974 and 1977; I don\'t believe that the
United States has ratified it, though it abides by these restrictions--and
in fact does more than it needs to. All the Protocols actually require is
that the military not purposely target civilians or define its targets in
such a way that civilians are included. Notice that it\'s perfectly OK to
kill civilians as long as civilian casualties are not "excessive in
relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated."

So blowing up that bunker during the Gulf War was perfectly legal; no one
"expected" that it was full of civilians. The military is more constrained
by public opinion than it is by actual international law.

Slow and lumbering, the Bagrii is none-the-less fast enough to keep up
with an infantry advance; unlike most seige engines, which must be
dismantled and reassembled each time they are moved. While this mobility
is of little use in conventional seiges, it is very useful against heavy
infantry units who lack cavalry screens. 

Extra ammunition is carried in a separate cart.

It did happen, and was verified by doing it again. 

IIRC it was in (then) Rhodesia, quite some time back. The first time some
landowner\'s son was shooting birds and thought he\'d scare off an elephant
he saw, and to his surpirse killed it. Needless to say his father was not
amused. When said father was telling the District Commisioner (or whatever
his title was) he expressed disbelief, so it was agreed that the landowner
would try to repeat the performance, using the Commisioner\'s elephant quota
(they had a certain quota of elephants per farm , for the landowners to
feed their native workers with). The landowner successfully repeated the feat.

What happened in both cases was that the shot was fired into the left side
of the elephant just as it extended its left leg forward to take a step.
The .22 bullets were solids, and they were aimed at the side of the heart.
With the skin streched taut the bullets could penetrate it, even though if
it had been loose and elastic they would\'ve bounced off. The bullets went
into the heart of the elephants, who then simply twitched as if stung and
walked off, showing little or no distress, and dropped dead after wlking a
few hundred yards.

One of the reasons (the main one is lack of repect) that .22s kill so many
people accidentally is that if they hit someone at a mile plus they do so
little immediate damage that the vistim assumes that it was just a scratch
or insect bite. Hoever the bullet penetrates deeply, and if it was in the
torso the vistim suddenly dies, or gets very sick and by the time they are
taken to hospital it\'s often too late.

It sems to me that this might provide an intermediate step from the

You could try contacting Leisure Games in London (details reposted below).
Their February Catalogue shows all the 101 books, but not Tim Collinsons\'

If you\'re still talking about elephants, then there\'s more than just bone
in the skull, but also a large number of air and fluid filled sinuses.
These act somewhat like spaced or composite armour, and have been known to
deflect .458 Winchester Magnum bullets. That\'s why flank shots into the
heart, or the brain from behind are the prefered shots on elephants.

Note though that the little .22 is one of the most energy efficient killers
around, and because of its small cross section, along with a velocity low
enough that solid bullets don\'t deform much, has a penetration all out of
proportion to its sive or muzzle energy. A .22LR solid will penetrate
nearly 12" of solid pine, though it takes little steel to stop it dead (I
guess penetration of steel is more closely related to ME).

Iraq shows the problem of what happens when one side plays by the rules 
and the other doesn\'t. There is no "legal" way I can see of solving it. 
Saddam doesn\'t care about sanctions - *he* isn\'t suffering - and his 
army/secret police are enough to keep the people under control. Saddam 
probably isn\'t stupid enough to start a proper war. The UN can\'t - and 
wouldn\'t - authorise an invasion, occupation, or assassination, and no 
individual country is willing to do it alone, partly because it\'s a major 
job, partly because it\'s "against the rules", but mostly because it sets 
a bad precedent (if the US sends a hit squad to take out Saddam, why 
shouldn\'t Iran do the same to Clinton?).

The Imperium, of course, wouldn\'t give a **** - they\'d just send in the 
Marines!

Pardon my French-- but I don\'t bloody think so!  Are we talking about the
same cartridge here?  The 100+ year-old .22 Long Rifle, rimfire cartridge?

Perhaps you are confusing the .22LR with the .22 Hornet, .220 Swift, .222
Remington/Remington Magnum, or .223 Remington?  And even those cartridges
would have difficulty with 6+ inches of solid bone...

The .470 Nitro Express "elephant gun" didn\'t even necessarily kill an
elephant out right.  The old .470\'s 500g, 2,150 fps, 5,130 ft/lb bullet
would often simply knock the elephant unconscious during headshots.

I see that here is a need to clarify my statement.

IIRC this was explicitly stated in a reloading manual I own.  Note that
small cross section slugs are more efficient penetrators.  If you would
like, I\'ll try to find the paragraph, but its really not that important
to me.  A 22 has a much better changce of penetrating ballistic cloth
armor than does a .30 cal.  In any case, I am making a caliber
comparison and not speaking about any specific round.

I haven\'t studied terminal ballistics for years, and I petty much accept
the arguments posited in FF&S1 concerning total impact energy.

Yes.  Visit http://www.otakuworld.com/kiss/ to get started with
KISS (KIsekae Set System - \'kisekae ningyou\' is Japanese, and means
something like \'playing dress-up with dolls).  You\'ll need a program (they 
have links to software for Windows 3.1, 95, and NT; Mac, UNIX, Amiga and 
Acorn computers) and lots of dolls (data files).  Some particularly nice
files to start out with are Nikki Silk, the Two Ranmas, Yu-ki Shinomiya,
and Playgirl (no, not _that_ playgirl).

Some of the dolls have pretty extensive wardrobe options!

Ah, ok.  Yes, calibre isn\'t everything.  When comparing *only* projectile
calibre, the smaller bullet will *always* out penetrate larger bullets.
This is part of the basis of flechette and discarding sabot technology.

Nothing in the SM-Supplement, nothing in the TA, no other source of

maybe a mistake by imperial mappers ;-)

In NZ the ruling is when faced with what you believe to be an illegal
order, you refuse stating your reasons and if the order is repeated you
must follow it. So you get the order in writting and log your objections
and then bring the matter to the attention of higher authorities at the
earliest opportunity (this last bit is vital, you can object all you like,
but if you don\'t inform higher command your stuffed).

IMTU the CO can be removed by the 2iC at any time, but the 2iC must be
prepared to justify their actions to a review board. The MO may require
the 2iC remove the CO, but must present medical evidence that the CO is
medically unfit.

The reported percentage of those identifying themselves as christians in the US
has been strongly increasing in the last 15 years, especially as the children of
the baby boomers reach adulthood.  Also dramatic increase in those regularly
attending services.

With all due respect, Volker, I think we both asked you for canon on the subject.
If there is no canon, we can agree to disagree and live happily ever after.  :-)

Ok, as long as we\'re clear that this is _your_ 3I and not my 3I, since canon is
silent (and wisely so) on the subject.

So, seeing no canon on the subject, I\'m going to implement my ideas.  Almost done
btw, will soon have up on webbage for your reading pleasure.

Humm, a .22LR through the eye and directly into the brain, would do it. 
It\'d be one lucky shot, though.  I\'ve got my doubts about a rock and a
grizzly, I *sure* wouldn\'t want to put it to a test.

So, 55 gal. of "stuff", roughly 9% of it C2H5OH.  I get 18 proof
from that; IIRC, wine is typically 12% or 24 proof.  This isn\'t
very potent; "damp" sites in my medievalist organization wouldn\'t
have any problem with something like this. (A "damp" site allows
beer, wine, and mead, but nothing stronger).

I wouldn\'t have more than one of these if I were driving within
about 24hrs (personal policy), but otherwise, I\'d have no problem
with it - since I always do alcohol in moderation anyway
(personal policy).

than (small) tactical nukes (the "Coronation"\'s spinal mount has a

big explosion; damage caused by nukes generally goes as yield to the
2/3 or 1/2 (I can\'t remember precisely which) - so 100 pulses by the
Coronation\'s gun are equivalent to 25 kilotonnes, or one Hiroshima-
sized bomb. If I read the Coronation correctly it\'s ROF 800/30 min (which,
I think, is actually illegal under FFS2...); so it produces the
equivalent of a Hiroshima every 4 minutes or so. It could replicate
the effect of the ten thousand-odd warheads in the US arsenal in
about a month - and that\'s a single battleship. Its 9 auxilliary
meson guns produce the equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT - a 2000-pound-bomb -
every two seconds or so. The spinal mount or meson bay on a destroyer
would be in the latter class - which should still do pretty well
at devastating a city or a "typical" population-5 or -6 world.
And, as others have noted, standard 6g12 missiles strike with an
energy of about 4x10^13 joules (200,000m/s)^2 * 1000 kg = 10 kT,
and a destroyer can carry about a hundred of them. All this is only
really effective against an undefended world, of course.

was discovered by a scout. The scout was on his way to a see a game out in
the county and got lost.  When he saw a young man far out in a grain field
he stopped to ask directions, calling the boy over.  When the young man got
near the scout noticed that he was carrying a sack in each hand.  The scout
asked the man what was in the sacks.

"Well, sir, this one has dead rabbits for my supper." said the lad holding
up one sack.

"And this one has my rocks." he said holding up the other.

Bob Feller had been "stoning" rabbits in the field, one rock, one throw,
one dead rabbit...or so the story goes. ;->

A friend of mine, one Jim Babcock, was on our high school track & field 
team. He would borrow the team\'s 20lb shotput and take it home to practice 
with. No one wanted to use it afterwards...it seems "Babo" would practice 
by hunting woodchucks with it.  <squish>

  For "defense of" they can be useful (we assume) - it\'s merely crucial
to use them _somewhere else_ in fulfilling that role.

  Possibly the Pluton system. You can\'t really accuse the French of

	I have been having some difficulty in locating items to help enhance my
collection as well as my reffing.  I cannot seem to even find someone who
owns any of the following items, let alone be able to
trade/purchase/steal/what-have-you to even get a photocopy.  Does anyone
actually own a copy of these items, and if so, what will it cost me to get
a copy (original or photocopied) for myself?

	DGP Items
	----
	Grand Census
	Grand Survey
	101 Robots


	I have included a list of items that I am willing to trade/sell for a copy
of one of the other items above:
	The numbers after the items list their \'wear\' on a scale of 1-5 with one
being the best condition possible for a used item.

	Shadows/Mission on Mithril Deluxe boxed set adventure (8+1/2"x11"
version)(2.5)
	Spinward Marches Campaign (minus Marches poster map) (2)
	Rebellion Sourcebook (1)
	Imperial Encyclopedia (1)
	Referee\'s Companion (1)
	Player\'s Manual (1)

	Book 6 Scouts (4)
	Traveller Digest #8 (1)
	JTAS #24 (2.5)
	JTAS #23 (2)
	JTAS #22 (1)
	BOJTAS #3 (2)
	BOJTAS #2 (3)
	Supplement #13 Veterans (2)
	Supplement #2 Animal Encounters (1.5)
	Double Adventure #6 Divine Intervention/Night of Conquest (1)
	Double Adventure #4 Marooned/Marooned Alone (1.5)
	Double Adventure #3 Argon Gambit/Death Station (2.5)
	Double Adventure #2 Mission on Mithril/Across the bright face (2.5)
	Double Adventure #1 Shadows/Annic Nova (3)
	Adventure #11 Murder on Arcturus Station (1)
	Adventure #10 Safari Ship (2.5)
	Adventure #9 Nomads of the world ocean (2)
	Adventure #7 Broadsword (2)
	Adventure #6 Expedition to Zhodane (2.5)
	Adventure #4 Leviathan (2.5)
	(2x) Adventure #1 The Kinunir (Both 3)
	

	I also have several other \'single\' items that I would not be opposed of
trading/selling.  Those items are as follows:
	High Passage #3 (FASA, 82)
	Sapies (Group One, 81)
	Starships and Space craft (JG)
	(2x) Ghostring (JG)
	Simba Safari (JG)
	Darthanon Queen (JG)
	The traveller logbook (JG)
	Waspwinter (JG)
	Amycus Probe (JG)
	Nystalux (GO)
	Geptorem (GO)
	Wabor-parn (GO)

	I also have an extensive collection of Traveller Digest magazines and
Challenge magazines.  I am not willing to part with the originals of these
items, but I am willing to make photocopies if the deal is good.  This
photocopies concept extends to any other items that I own (which there is a
great deal not listed here) which can and should be taken into
consideration when looking for other items.

Please reply to: scspieker@ncweb.com

In my campaign, Roller Ball is a very popular sport in Lunion Subsector.
On Lunion itself, one of the ongoing powers has been the Stevenson City
Dreadnaughts (named for the numerous Navy support and construction
facilities around and above the city)

    'body' => 'When the Vilani conquerored the Luriani in -4500 they attempted to impose
their culture on the Luriani; Vilani governors were placed in control of
Luriani worlds and the Luriani were expected to conform to Vilani cultural
norms. These efforts were less than successful, though the Luriani did
remain firmly under the control of the Vilani, their culture remained
largely intact, the Vilani were never able to stamp out the emotional and
independent nature of the Luriani. Thus when the Solomani arrived in the
Fornast sector in -2223 they were greeted as liberators by the Luriani and
a number of Luriani units served in the Terran forces during their final
drive on Vland, proving that they had lost none of their fighting abilities.

With the final defeat of the Vilani in -2219 the Luriani expected that the
Solomani would restore their independence. However they were to be sadly
disappointed. Unlike the Geonee or Suerrat, the Luriani were not granted
autonomy under the Rule of Man. Naturally this bred resentment with in the
Luriani and in -2186 the Luriani rebelled against the Rule of Man. What
followed was a tragedy for the Luriani. Isolated with only a limited
production base, the Luriani faced an alliance of both Terran and Vilani
forces. The Luriani hoped that the other minor races would come to their
aid, these hopes proved futile and the Luriani were gradually worn down and
in -2180 their final stronghold fell and in a cruel turn of fate, the Luriani
again came under Vilani occupation. However under the Rule of Man, Luriani
art and music found a wide audience amongst the Solomani; and this lead to
widespread sympathy for the fate of the Luriani. Finally in -1932 Empress
Juliana established the Luriani Cultural Region. With this the each
individual Luriani world was granted internal self rule, answering to a
Solomani planetary governor, with the entire region under the control of
a military governor general.

With the collapse of the Rule of Man in -1776, the Solomani governor general
of the Luriani Cultural Region found herself isolated and vulnerable. Admiral
Martinez solved her problems by reaching an agreement with the Luriani. She
transformed the Luriani Cultural Region into the Luriani Protectorate. Under
this compromise her fleet provided protection for the Luriani in return for
support, while the Luriani worlds were allowed to retain thier independence.
The Protectorate continued to exist into the Long Night; the Protectorate
gradually evolved into a unique government. The Solomani provided the much
needed skills to administer a large scale interstellar government, whilst the
Luriani provided the neccessary support facilities and their warrior class
came to dominate the Protectorate fleet. Eventually however the Long Night
claimed the Protectorate, by -1200 the Protectorate fleet had dwindled to
just a handful of vessels and contact between the worlds had all but ceased.
In -1183, Protector De Valine acknowledged that the Protectorate could no
longer defend the Luriani worlds. The Solomani settled on the Luriani worlds
and the Luriani Protectorate succumbed to the Long Night.

The situation remained unchanged until the coming of the Syleans. The Sylean
Federation Scout Service reached the Luriani in -19. The arrival of the SFSS
reawakened the Luriani\'s desires for the stars, Derri had been able to retain
TL7 throughout the Long Night and the Solomani still remained a distinct
racial grouping. Given the prod of the Syleans arrival, the Luriani applied
themselves to regaining the stars. It took the Luriani just 30 years to
recover to TL9 and began to reestablish the Protectorate. By 32, the Luriani
Protectorate was a thriving interstellar community once more, encompassing
most worlds within 5 parsecs of Derri. The Protectorate was a curious state,
one which the new Imperium found hard to understand or deal with. Eventually
the Imperium was forced to do something about the Luriani. Intially they
tried to incorporate the Luriani through diplomatic means and intially this
appeared to be a making progress, but negotiations dragged on and Emperor
Artemsus became frustrated and in 89 an offensive was launched aimed at
settling the matter once and for all. Once again the Luriani proved to be
masters of three dimensional warfare, in 94 the Imperial fleet suffered a
sharp defeat at the Battle of Gusashka and were forced to withdraw. It was
now clear that it would be a formidable task to incorporate the Luriani
through military means. In 95 a peace settlement was negotiated and the
Imperium returned to more indirect methods. Since that time relations between
the Protectorate and the Imperium have remained strained.

Why not just tag the rock with a beacon and let a company mass driver ship

As you will have seen from the relevant bits posted by someone else,
targetting cities is not OK. Targetting indivdual military goals
located in a city is OK, but not treating a number of distinct
military sites interspersed with civilian buildings (which is just
what an industrial city is). Mind you, I\'m not basing my own beliefs
on this (since I wasn\'t even sure that it was the case); it just
happens to coincide with my beliefs.

>Otherwise every nation in WWII would guilty of war crimes.

Bingo! Give the man a cigar! Though I guess that some of them gets away
on the technicatity that these rules weren\'t formulated until 1970 ;-)
Just like a lot of other wrongdoers throughout history must be let off
on the same technicality without making their particular bits of
wrongdoing right.

I\'m not trying to single out anybody. The question of whether the use of
nuclear bombs against Japan was morally correct arose, and I answered.
If you had asked me about the German terror-bombing of London my answer
would have been similar.

>The bombing of cities was accepted by all sides.

I repeat: If something is wrong then the fact that everybody else is
doing it dosen\'t make it right. If it is right, it is irrelevant who
else is doing it.

So who\'s inconsistent?

According the the issue of JTAS where the original writeup of the Dynchia
were published, the author had placed them somewhere where they conflicted
with some previously published material (I never checked out just what)
and they were therefor not official. I don\'t know if that changed later.

About _Azhanti High Lightning_. There were nine Lightning Class cruisers
named _"Something" High Lightning_. Since four of them were indisputably
human races of the Imperium, it seems to permissible assumption that the
other five were too. Not unassailable, but quite plausible, IMO.

I doubt it, Eris.  I\'m pretty sure that there is enough bone behind the eye
socket to stop or deflect a .22LR.  Thanks for playing, though ;)

As for the rock and the grizzly, nobody mentioned how big that rock was (or
if it was one of those damn .1c rocks).  Now if we\'re talking about taking
out a Vancouver Grizzlies basketball player, your chances have increased
dramatically :P

Yep, been reading it nightly and enjoying it immensely except for the

an entirely different one to that which was meant.  Suggests use of a spell
checker and no human brain to follow and check it properly.  (First rule of
spell checking - never trust the machine alone.)

Funnily enough, your scenario is the next one to read!  Hoping to get to it

Ling Standard Products gave Lanax on Aramanxs/Aramis fission powered
submarines in their WWII style squabble (Challenge Wet Navy merc
adventure). In 1119 IMTU they\'ve going full tilt on bombmaking in a small
research station in the icy cold southern Lanax (remarkably similar to the
heavy water plant in Norway during WWII).

They\'ll nuke their heads off as the Imperium is busy fighting the Vargr to
bother with pesky nuke wars. My team of PCs are one jump from arriving
there offering "their" nukes to the highest bidder (they\'ve joined the
looting of Depot earlier and carted away with a few nuclear warheads).

jumpcapable ship rule, he IHTU (In His Traveller Universe) has imposed an

Look at a flashlight pointed at you - bright yes, look at it pointing
sligthly to your right - not as bright etc. Basically even a missed shot
will illuminate the target somewhat and that pulse will be detectable with
a telescope.

You could say that as well.

Sorry, there has been a debate on the lsit as to what this gravfocus
handwave really is. If it was a gravitational field powerful enough to bend
the light back into focus on the target then, it was argued, the gravfocus
device would be a much more powerful weapon than the laser itself. Sort of
like a beam that could crush ships remotely and as that would lead to
problems another solution was put forth: A wave that travelled with the
laserpulse and kept it in focus but with much less energy. People more well
read in wave mechanics than I put forth that a "soliton" had just the right
parameters to do the job. A side note about this soliton is that a missed
shot could conceivably also be detected from its gravpulse.

With good enough range a repulsor or strong gravfocius device could shurely
mess with sensor arrays etc but I\'m not shure if the feedback mechanisms in
them wouldn\'t revert it as soon as the pulse has passed. For repulsers I\'m
not shure as I have no idea about how these are supposed to work. In the
Digest detailing the emperors palace it was said that the palace was held
up by repulsors on the ground and that this was supposed to be more safe
than using gravplates on the palace. This to me sounds like strong forces
at work but...

>Explain it to me like I\'m stupid (\'cuz I am).

Me too. I\'ll offer proof to the fact that I am at least as stupid as the
other person by this little anecdote:

Once upon a time I was awoken by my phone ringing by my bed. I was really
tired/hung over and it was early morning but I picked it up and put it to
my ear. Right then I realised that I had compleately forgotten what one was
supposed to say when answering the phone. I just held it there for perhaps
a minute without coming up with a single halfwit utterance. The other end
finally hang up and I still don\'t know who called (probably somebody who
wanted to give me gazillions for being so smart).

So you think "yes, I knew we were committing war crimes, but I was only 
following orders" is an acceptable defence? Sorry, but I don\'t.

The captain gives the order to, say, shoot a civilian ship. Which is unarmed, 
and committing no crime. And is full of orphans, nuns, and cute little kittens. 
You\'re the XO, and all you\'re going to do is say, "I don\'t think that\'s a very 
good idea, sir"? You could argue a bit more, but all that\'ll do is get you 
thrown in the brig, because the regulations don\'t allow you to do anything 
more.

And you might remember:   You have to be ALIVE to wrestle with your

     I was faced with a situation once at work where a person started fighting
w/ my security guard.  I had an opportunity to inflict a fight-ending, but
potientially fatal blow to the agressor.  I chose not to, because I felt the
situation, while serious, did not warrant it.  I was wrong.  The man ran over
my security guard with his car and seriuosly injured him.  Is this my fault?
Maybe yes, maybe no.  But I FEEL responsible.  I will never second-guess
myself again.

I hope there really is some connection to what is being discussed here...it
seemed very clear at the beginning...

Well, there is an alternative.  If you can confine the crap and burn it
at very high temps you could destroy it.  Hit the factory with a
penetrator/incendiary and incinerate the stuff along with the indises of
the factory.  Unfortunately, I doubt that theis is a "refined"
technique.  Meaning I bet no one has ever done it before, even
experimentally.

The United States is developing a specialized bomb to do just that.  Extremely
good at penetrating bunkers, and it burns _extremely_ hot.  IIRC, they can\'t
get it quite hot enough to ensure the complete destruction of all biological
agents.

    'body' => 'After scratching my head with a pencil for several hours, I
finally figured out what the real odds on Dhe are.

To recap, for those who don\'t preserve TMLs in an
easily-accessible format, Anders Backman described this game as a
sort of roulette - the gambler bets on a single number, 1 to 6,
and two standard, fair, six-sided dice are rolled.  If the throw
reveals exactly one occurrence of the wagered number, the wager
is lost; if exactly two occurrences of the wagered number are
revealed, the player wins a 9-to-1 payoff, and if none are
revealed, the standard game has all bets ride for another throw
("no-result").

In determining the odds, it turns out that the "no-result" throws
are null in the calculations.  The important question is the
number of "terminal states", i.e., throws which result in either
a win or a loss.  In Dhe, there are eleven terminal states (to
verify, "throw" all the combinations of one red die and one green
die, and count the number of combinations where any single given
number appears.  There will be five where each die is the only
one showing the selected number (for a total of ten), plus one
combination where both will show it (total eleven)).  Of these
terminal states, only one is a win for the gambler.  "Fair" odds
are therefore eleven-and-decimal-to-one; typically, the "house"
would round this to 11-to-1, and pay for the bright lights and
scantily-clad waitresses (or local cultural equivalent) with the
remaining difference.  Of course, one percent isn\'t really a lot,
so the house will generally pay somewhat lower.  At ten-to-one,
the house advantage is ten percent; at the stated nine-to-one,
the house keeps nineteen percent.

For comparison, the house advantage in roulette is roughly five
percent on the American wheel (with two zeros), and
two-and-one-half percent on European wheels (with only one zero).

that to all sites, then there goes the "inducement" to manufacture it in
the future.

  The real kicker in the pants though...

1) the people who likely would tell their own government "no!  Don\'t
produce biologicals" are the same ones who would be better off shooting
themselves so that their government doesn\'t torture them or their families
for having protested.

2) this only works for the biologicals that don\'t threaten the full
Biosphere...

  But aside from that - US american warmongerers who hate all of the earth,
and would rather die that be rational - would LOVE to see this kind of
suffering visited upon the earth...

Hey Stephen,

Saw a report on the same thing on CNN channel on my desktop.  According to
the report, it\'s a small globular galaxy believed to have a large amount of
dark matter.

Do you want I should clip it and send it to you?

The military has designed bunker busting weapons that do just what you
described, to burn up chemical and biological agents before they
spread. 

Unfortunately, it is impossible to locate bioweapon facilities from
the air. They don\'t take a lot of space and they don\'t use a lot of
energy. I believe a USAF general described the expertise needed to
brew biological agents as just above what was needed to make beer in a
micro brewery.

This is  similar to the issue of a geurilla groups deliberately
blurring the distinction between civilians and combatants.  Under
international law, if you put military targets among civilians
you are responsible for the casualties.  However, then the
pictures get splashed over TV screens the side the usually
gets blames is the side the fired the munitions (witness
Isreal in Beruit).  What this means is that outrage over
civilian casualties ends up rewarding people who sought
to bring them about.

	He was exagerating ... any homebrewer or cook with the right information

This was a change in MegaTraveller, if I recall correctly, from Classic
Traveller\'s placement of the Suerrat at straightforward Ilelish/Ilelish.
ISTR that Volomil\'s UPP makes it an unlikely homeworld.  Ilelish proper
seems a far better choice, since it provides obvious explanations for the
Ilelish Pacification Campaigns, Ilelish Revolt, and the continuing
presence of an Ilelish cultural region: they all stem from the presence of
a well-entrenched minor race, the Suerrat.

Right, but ISTR that CT Adventure 6 ("Expedition to Zhodane") clearly
states that even that assimilation was a challenge for the Zhodani.  The
cost and effort of trying to seize another two or three sectors, hold
them, and absorb them fully into the Zhodani social fabric would have been
abhorrent.

The races used for naming AHL cruisers are:

Azhanti, Syleans, Vilani, Fiorin, Geonee, Acheron, Suerrat, Ilurians, and
Luriani. 

Carlos Alos-Ferrer has done some superb work on the short-and-technical
Geonee, which hopefully will be web-accessible again soon.  John Snead and
I have done some independent work on the Suerrat: I\'m spending part of
today readying some of my own write-up of these arborean-chimplike
homonids for web publication.  And I applaud the splendid write-up, just
appeared on TML, for the aquatic Luriani.  Did I see on the list which I
snipped mention of someone\'s take on the Azhanti?

I have some notes I need to spruce up on the Acheron as a troglodytic
species (inspired in part by my never-finished entry to the "Feast of the
Voyagers" web adventure contest -- anyone remember that?).

Fiorin and Ilurians, anyone?  (What interesting eco-niches remain to be
filled?  A furred, cold-adapted species?  Free-fall adaptees a la Niven\'s
*The Smoke Ring*?  Radical takes on sexual dimorphism?)

I\'m a tad disappointed by M:0\'s decision to "back-burner" the Syleans as a
miniscule and primitive culture now all-but-assimilated by Vilani and
Solomani immigrants: it seems to me a lazy decision (though well in
keeping with IG\'s rush-it-out-the-doors philosophy) that missed some
exciting opportunities, and which doesn\'t fit well with the admittedly
limited evidence (the regard for the race shown by the AHL series, Lucan\'s
eventual insistence on High Sylean, etc.).  Anybody have some heretical-
canon ideas on who the Syleans are?

Being the other \'MJD\' and being talked about, while having personal problems
with my beloved (my PC, not my girlfriend), I thought I would clarify things
for everyone.
In addition to the initials MJD , I have another one, which makes me MJAD, but
since the old arcade machines only accepted three initials, I use MJD (more
preferable than MAD).
As for Marc, its my parents, not me that may be trying to confuse.  Accept no
liability!  Would Martin like to be the ONE, I will accept the subservient
position of being the other.

On a more personal note, Martin.  You sent me your phone number, but because of
the problems with my PC (namely I have spent the past day and a half
reinstalling all my software) I have lost your number, could you resend it
please.



There are fools everywhere I look, especially when I have a shave in the
morning.

As I recall, there\'s an MT-era Travellers\' News Service wire which also
identifies Ilelish as the Suerrat homeworld.  IMHO, this would make the
punishment that Martin doles out to Ilelish at the end of the Ilelish
Revolt even more nasty; Ilelish had its lush tropical region evacuated
and then blasted flat from orbit (as related in Rebellion Sourcebook).  
For the apparently arboreal Suerrat, this would be brutal.

I\'m not sure Volomil/Miitan is even referenced anywhere.  Alien Module 8
is Darrians, I think, and might just mention the Suerrat as another minor
race with a past.  My suspicion is that this is a HIWG-ism that never saw
print; if someone knows otherwise, they should speak up!  Personally, I
also think Ilelish/Ilelish makes more sense.

Worse, the facilities to do so aren\'t much more complex. The problem is in
delivering the agents. scarily, that isn\'t much of a problem either.

IIRC, Judaism has no hell.

Interestingly, (and this is based solely on my memory of one documentary or
another) the term Tartarus for Hell comes from the name of the cesspools/sewage
areas near Jerusalem that held much of that cities waste.  Apparently, it was
always burning to some extent and vary noxious.  The author of the documentary
was saying thats where the Fire and Brimstone images of Hell come from.

Yep. Even though the fact that MacMurray\'s character is the baddie is pointed
out by Jose Ferrer at the end of the movie, Bogart\'s performance as Queeg is
so riveting that most people forget anybody else is in the movie.

Great flick. Watch it if you have never been in the service, and you\'ll get a
pretty good idea how things work. Book is better, but great flick.

After reviewing all ot the last THUDDD\'s entrants I went back to the drawing
boards and came up with this little ditty. It a nice Adventure type ship,
with a small crew, plenty of cargo and passenger space (for it\'s 450 sdt
size) and a little sting. It comes as drawn with a singel heavy laser
turret, but has the space (not the power!) to mount a second. The stats
speak for themselves, one thing I did note was that it was much more
economical to mount enough fuel for 2 jumps with a 1 jump drive, also a
single larger Sandcaster is more space concervitive than multiple lower
factor sandcaster, and you save on crew costs. As written this ship reflects
a crew with a Steward/Gunner and a Medic/Sandcaster operator, which makes
since from an economical point of view, this can be changed at the loss of 2
Middle passage cabins. I\'ve included the economics data from Andrew\'s
spreadsheet, both non-subsidized and subsidized, suprisingly the ship is
barely profitable on it\'s own. I can\'s see any other way of shaving costs,
other than to drop the 20 sdt boat, but I LIKE having some type of lifeboat.

Look it over folks and let me know what you think.

... the Sayat.  _Obviously_.  After escaping from Napoleonic France, a
large task force of time-travelling Sayat agents found themselves stranded
on some rathole of a planet in the late First Empire, and set about
"improving" the local population.  They disguised themselves from the
authorities by dropping all the vowels out of their ethnonym (Sayat > Syt),
and due to orthographic sloppiness, the cross-bar on the "t" dropped after
several centuries and was read as "l".  The rest of the name "Sylea"
derives from the "eeek!" normally uttered by Vilani merchants approaching
the world as the manipulation progressed.  By the time of the Terran
conquest, everyone was convinced that the Syleans were another separate
minor race, rather than messed-up Vilani.  Even the Templars were fooled...
at first.

Ever wonder just _why_ the Syleans were "back-burnered" all of a sudden?
Eh?  Think about it!

Michael and I have exchanged email, and it sounds as though he had far
more detail in mind for this human subspecies than managed to make it into
the IG product.  I never wanted the Syleans to be as _physically_ variant
as, say, the Suerrat or Luriani.  But some differing preconceptions of
Sylean history meant that I expected a greater _cultural_ difference than
Michael\'s limited description was able to provide. 

I will look forward to any further write-ups of "his" Syleans that Michael
can provide -- I think we\'re far more in agreement than I had first suspected.

I\'m here (wherever here is - I assume that the sysadmin hasn\'t changed the
domain names again, but I wouldn\'t bet more than a stale muffin on it).

David, I also replied to you personally, but I\'ve been getting bounces
from all sorts of addresses that used to work. (Including Dom Mooney. Dom,
I\'m really not ignoring you.)  The only reply I get to my messages is
"Your email has been noted." which doesn\'t actually say that they are

time I pointed out email problems, I\'m not pushing this one, because I
don\'t want my internal email to be screwed up as well as my external feed.

IIRC the office remained but not the divinity, so it appears there was a

It was in digest 168 and it\'s archived on my web site. However I now have
a spell checked version and I keep getting requests to repost it. So in
response:

     ***The Ine Givar***

Overview: The Ine Givar are the main anti-Imperial terrorist group operating
in the Domain of Deneb during the final years of the 3rd Imperium. They are
an early expression of the tensions that were building in the latter years of
the 3rd Imperium (which would ultimately lead to Dulinor\'s assassination of
Strephon, the Rebellion, and then to Norris\'s democratic reforms in the
regency). However they were before their time and got frustrated at attempts
at peaceful reform and turned to violence.

History: Ine Givar was born on Rhylanor in 948. His parents were minor noble
"placekeepers" of the type which became increasingly common in the latter
Imperium. As he grew up, he travelled with his parents on many of the "fact
finding" make work missions that were the lot of a minor noble. During these
missions he became aware of the many oppressive and corrupt regimes that the
Imperium turned a blind eye to. These early travels were to have a profound
influence on him, leaving him deeply disillusioned with the Imperium.

He enrolled in the University of Rhylanor in 966, studying political science.
A very talented student, at first he excelled at his studies, gaining his
bachelors degree with first class honours in 970. However he had increasingly
become involved in politics during this time, gradually building up a group
of dedicated followers. He gained his Masters with honours in 968 and his
doctorate in 974. However rather than move into a comfortable job in the
bureaucracy, he choose to devote his life to agitating for peaceful democratic
changes to the "corrupt Imperial system". This rapidly gained him much
official disfavour, but did not prevent him from building up a subsector wide
following. With the coming of the Third Frontier War he was detained as a
"threat to security" in 980 and died in custody in 984. Normally, other than
a few minor protests, this would have been the end of the matter. However,
the authorities had not taken his lover, Kisla Famia, into account. Born into
the lower classes of Rhylanor, her great-grandparents and grandparents had
been executed during the psionic suppressions and she bore an almost
fanatical hatred of the Imperium. She also had an enormous talent for media
manipulation. With the end of the war and her own release in 987 she launched
a massive media campaign to "uncover the truth about Ine Givar\'s death".
Eventually this bore fruit and in 990 an official inquiry was convened. Over
the course of the inquiry, the evidence mounted that Givar had been subjected
to systematic brutalisation and torture. Naturally his supported expected
that those responsible would be brought to justice. However when the inquiry
finally delivered its finding in 992, it reported that Givar\'s death was a
"regrettable accident caused by his failure to cooperate fully with his
jailers".

In late 992, his supporters organised a mass rally outside the Rhylanor Naval
base (where Givar had been imprisoned) to demand those responsible be called
to task. It is uncertain just what happened, but during the demonstration a
detachment of Imperial Marines opened fire on the crowd. In the resulting
chaos and panic at least 700 demonstrators were killed.

From Kisla Famia\'s declaration after the Rhylanor massacre:
"The Empire speaks of honour; where was their honour when they murdered
Ine, where was their honour when they let his killers go free to ply their
vile trade, where was their honour when they slaughtered these innocents?
Where is their honour when they allow despots and tyrants kill and torture
and maim their citizens? They have no honour!"
"Ine believed in democracy, Ine also believed that democracy could be
achieved by peace and negotiation. They do not want peace, they do not want
democracy, they want only power and blood. If they want blood, I say let them
have blood! They tell us that the path to democracy is through patience and
negotiation; they tell us now is not the right moment. I say the time for
negotiation is over, the moment for democracy is now!"

From this point on, the Ine Givar movement abandoned peaceful change and
moved to terrorism to achieve their aims. Their first action was the dramatic
bombing of the Imperial Naval Intelligence headquarters on Rhylanor. Typical
of the bold audacious actions that became their trademark under Famia\'s
leadership. Within five years there were Ine Givar cells on most worlds
within the Domain of Deneb, within sixteen they had become the dominant
anti-Imperial movement in the Domain, and had cells extending as far as
Capital itself. The movements early highwater mark came in 1020 when Famia
masterminded an assassination attempt on the entire Imperial family. The
attempt failed, but it did leave Emperor Paulo\'s younger brother Elmor dead.

Around 1035, a shift occurred in the movement\'s leadership. Famia was by now
96 years old and her health was failing. She stepped down and Ine Givar\'s
son Natise took over the movements leadership. Natise Givar had both his
father\'s charisma and his mother\'s tactical and administrative abilities. He
also nursed a lasting hatred over his father\'s death. Under his leadership,
the movement grew in both strength and efficiency. Natise planned for the
long term, contacts were made with the Zhodani and Sword Worlds; and their
support was gained. Other terrorist groups were absorbed or eliminated and
the organisations targets came to include the megacorporations which
supported the Imperium.

In 1067 a leadership coup replaced Natise with Votan Gamiilash, one of the
movements "young Turks". Under Gamiilash the movement abandoned most of its
activities beyond Corridor sector, concentrating almost exclusively on the
domain of Deneb. Gamiilash also changed the movements focus; under her
leadership it became far more tied and dependent on Zhodani and Sword Worlds
support. It was under Gamiilash that the movement struck its first purely
civilian target. In 1075, Ine Givar operatives smuggled a fusion warhead
into the city of Kashar on Zivije. The resulting blast caused over 5,000,000
casualties (including 2,800,000 dead). It was as a result of this atrocity
that the Zhodani instigated an bloody coup in the movement and replaced
Gamiilash with a committee headed by Wardn Sortin in 1077.

This committee structure was to dominate the movement\'s leadership for the
next 40 years. Under the committee, the Ine Givar became little more than
an extension of the Zhodani and Sword Worlds intelligence services. The
Ine Givar were a major factor in the Fourth Frontier War. Ine Givar guerillas
tied up many Imperial troops which could have been better employed at the
front and provided invaluable intelligence to the Outworld Coalition. It was
Ine Givar agents who discovered that Imperial Naval Intelligence had
compromised the Zhodani\'s deep space base between Yres and Menorb and lead
to the Battle of Two Suns (however it did not prevent the Coalition from
loosing the battle).

After the Fourth Frontier War, the Ine Givar curtailed their activities
and rebuilt their strength for the next war. They continued to strike at
Imperial targets and fostered unrest on a number of worlds. As the Fifth
Frontier War drew nearer, their activities increased. Guerilla cadres were
established and on Efate and Ruie they moved to almost open warfare. With
the outbreak of the Fifth Frontier War in 1107, the Ine Givar sprung into
action. The carefully groomed Guerilla cadres tied down many Imperial troops
in the opening stages and provided bridgeheads on a number of worlds.
However the war was to prove to be a major setback for the movement. As the
Coalition campaign faltered, the Ine Givar cadres were left stranded and
destroyed. Much of the movement\'s strength was lost in the latter stages
of the war. The movement felt deeply betrayed by the Zhodani; and in 1114
Rojel Nuguma seized control of the movement. He greatly reduced the movement\'s
ties to the Zhodani and Sword Worlds and set about rebuilding and replacing
the lost cells. However, the movement had nearly been destroyed in the
Fifth Frontier War and it took a long time to recover. It was not until the
mid 1120\'s that the movement began to resume activities.

Organisation: The Ine Givar was originally an outgrowth of a political
movement and that heritage shows in its organisation. The movement is
directed by Central Committee, a group of thirteen individuals headed
by a President. In theory the Central Committee is the supreme body and
the President merely chairs the Central Committee and all decisions are
made collectively. However, in reality, the Ine Givar have never actually
conformed to this theoretical pattern. For the greater bulk of its
history, the real seat of power was the President, with the Central
Committee acting as a debating forum for the more powerful factions within
the organisation. Even during the so called "Committee Period" (1077 to
1114) the real power did not actually reside with the Central Committee
(at that time the Ine Givar were effectively controlled by the Zhodani
and Sword World\'s intelligence services).

Below the Central Committee are the Quadrants. Each Quadrant consists
roughly of four Imperial Subsectors and these are the basic organisational
unit of the Ine Givar. Each Quadrant is run by a Committee of seven
individuals. These are charged with carrying out the overall directions of
the Central Committee. Each Quadrant divides itself into a military and a
political arm, both completely independent of the other but answering to
the Quadrant Committee. For reasons of security, no person in the political
arm is supposed to have any knowledge of the personnel of the military arm
and vis versa, however, as might be expected this is not always possible.
Both the military and political arms then divide themselves into a number
of Districts (the actually size of an individual District is dependent on
a number of factors, but most cover between four and six worlds), though
the military and political districts do not necessarily correspond.

The political arm is responsible for organising all forms of political
agitation, from student demonstrations to workers strikes; and is the most
"visible" face of Ine Givar. The military arm is divided into four distinct
types: Main force units (Guerilla Cadres), Direct action units (the classic
terrorist), Intelligence units (deep agents planted for intelligence
gathering), and Special operations groups (Agent Provectures). In order to
minimise the security risks, both the military and political arms are
organised along the classic "Cell structure". Under this organisation, each
"cell" is a completely independent unit with only the cell leader knowing
any outside contacts, and even then only one contact up (ie the cell leader
will know how to contact one cell in the organisation above them and any
cells subordinate to them). Thus if a cell leader is captured, whilst all
the cells below may be compromised, the cells above and across are far less
likely to be compromised. This "cell structure" has remained relatively
constant throughout the Ine Givar\'s existence (indeed it is the most common
organisational structure of such groups).

Aims and Philosophy: The driving aim of the Ine Givar has always been to
reform the Imperium into a democratic society. This philosophy unlies all of
the organisation\'s aims and demands. Its manifesto can be summed up quite
simply they demand: an end to the nobility, that the Imperium remove all
corrupt and oppressive local governments, that the Imperium restrains the
predatory economic activities of Imperial corporations, and that the Imperial
security apparatus be replaced with a system not riddled with corruption and
brutality.


If I\'ve missed out anything, or anyone can come up with more ideas, please
let me know.

  A heck of a good point. In an urban environment guerrilla attacks
will be indistinguishable from terrorism; this can be a wonderful
way to complicate the lives of over-armed merc PC\'s. While they may
be expecting tough hostage situations, they may be challenged by a
_literal_ no-win situation, or even less subtle ambiguities like
simply killing suspected terrorists without evidence (stop them
before they can strike again - but what if I\'m wrong?).

  There may be some basis for insights into real internal wars here.

BTW Dark matter is the pro astronomers name for handwave. Whenever
something like galactic spin rates, galactic group sizes, galactic
formation doesn\'t fit physics astronomers put a ltlle dark matter here and
there to make it fit. As there generally is more dark matter than normal
one in a typical astronomer conjured galaxy I\'d say large scale astronomy
is one of the weakest sciences around.

Don\'t worry - when an expanding TL12? RC meets an expanding TL17 Regency, I
know who my money\'s on. Where do you think that most of the retrospective
comments on the Star Vikings come from? ;-)

The M0 attitude is so much more believable to me - hints at the nastyness
that drove an Empire outwards at more than a parsec a year. Personally
(IMTU) the avoidance of the Rim is because the Sylean Scouts know that the
Rim is at TL13 but not expansionist.

I must say thank you for the positive feedback I\'ve had on the Luriani.

Might I suggest we "ringfence" at least one of these races. That way
individual referees could develop the race for their own campaigns without
worring about it being invalidated later. Mignt I suggest we ringfence the
Illurians.

Depending on your interpretation of how nuclear dampers work and how much
"collateral damage" making nuclear material non-radioactive does, I imagine
that it is a fairly small task for a IN ship with a nuke damper to hire a
Belter ship, tell him to "Find the high-grade radioactives" on the planet,
and then switch on the damper.

Then tell the locals that you can keep this up as long as neccessary.

What turns tragedy into farce is that this is precisely the deal that, in
the end, went down - the trial and execution of the War Cabinet, but the
safety of the person of the Emperor was guaranteed.

It should also be noted that following this, Truman was re-elected.

I believe that had this offer been made through an intermediary, then it
would have been accepted at any time following the breach of the Japanese
inner defensive perimeter.

Yes, I know, but Americans have shown weird opinions in other polls as
well:
I once heard that a sizeable portion of US-High Schoolers believe that
Hitler (or the Nazi´s) are still in power in Germany....
When we tried to make this study in our school (an international school
in the Netherlands, a country nextdoor to Germany) 25% of the American
Section´s High School Students professed the same opinion, and that
living no farther than 20 km´s from the border... Somehow figures.
Somehow also explains why my Father and I, when we were in the States,
once were greeted with "Heil Hitler" as soon as the waitress figured out
we were speaking German.... Sometimes on is just left speechless.
Nuff said!....

I\'m used to you stogy Europeans and your "he\'s different, let\'s burn
him" approach. Why do you think my ancesters came to America in the
first place? ;->

IMTU, the upper (and lower for that matter) limit to ship volume is
driven indirectly by the volume, power and cost of related technologies,
and those technologies vary by TL. 
The volume, power required and cost/unit-volume of maneuver drives, CG
units, and jump drives all vary by TL, and power plants, themselves,
vary in volume and cost by TL.  These factors place functional bounds on
both the lower and upper practical/economical volumes for ships.

Please remember, I *am* a heretic who uses a lot of alter-tech IMTU, ex.
stutterwarp for STL and jump drives for FTL, so my way isn\'t for
everybody.

No, that\'s about right in the US. It doesn\'t mean all 86% are very
religious. You\'ll also notice it doesn\'t specify *which* God they

Apparently, quite a few people think so.  I run into people all the time
that believe in life after death, but don\'t believe in hell, so it
doesn\'t surprise me that more believe in heaven than believe in hell.

No, that\'s encouraging! I\'m surprised the majority polled accept
evolution, in some form, that\'s a *good* sign. At the public college
where I teach we had a some trouble just 2 years ago over the teaching
of *human* evolution in biology classes. It was Ok for the textbooks to
teach non-human evolution, but we actually opposition in the curriculum
committee over keeping the teaching of human evolution in biology.

As for the creation of the world in 7 days, quite a few religious
Christians believe that *and* the scientific record. One rationalization
is that the days refer to "God\'s days" and we humans have no clear
understanding as to what God might consider a day. The 7 days can be
seen as alogorical, not literal, and that\'s also a common preception.
And then may of us follow the dictum of "render unto Ceaser what is
Ceaser\'s and to God what is God\'s", and seperate what we *believe*
religiously and what we *think* scientifically into mental
compartments....who was it that said "consistancy is the hobgoblin of
simple minds", Wilde? Shaw?

Ob Trav: Religion seems to be an almost universal human meme. I\'ve
noticed that even most self-proclaimed atheists are "religiously"
anti-religious. ;->  That being the case, I think it is likely that most
of humanitii will believe in a Supreme Being(s) and practice some form
of religion. The religions of Earth will have been spread widely by
Solomani colonists and missionaries, so you\'ll find Christians, Muslims,
Bhuddists, Hindus, Taoists, etc all over the Known Universe. I think the
other races of man will contribute their own religious beliefs and
practices as well.  

Foex, IMTU, ships still practice "Light Dimming" prior to entering jump,
and it *never* was to conserve energy. It started as a traditional
*religious* practice from one of the main Vilani religious sects. In
that sect you always dimmed (or put out) lights before offering a prayer
of protection, and that practice was carried over into space. Now the
practice has been taken up across all of Known Space, even while the
religious meaning behind it hasn\'t. Aboard ship, dimming the lights
provides a warning that jump is about to take place, the religious can
take a moment to pray, and the religious and non-religious, alike, can
brace themselves for the wrenching twist of entering jumpspace.

The important question is "how many of these \'converts\' weren\'t at
least *nominally* \'Christian\' beforehand?". The folks being lost by the
Catholics are going to other *Christian* churches for the most part.
And the same goes for the folks joining the "fundamentalists".

These are folks who were *alrerady* christian. Wha may be changing is
the number of people who are actively practicing their religion.

I still like the other "version" of TDX we came up with. Instead of
exploding at right angles to the gravity vector (giving a "horizontal
disk") it explodes *along* the vector. That is, you get a vertical
"spike" effect. It\'s great from cracking bunkers and for anti-tank
mines.

Please note that "two inch diameter rock" and "quarter pound" are both
*way* off. Typical "track ballast" is more like 3 to 4 inches. And it
weighs a lot more than a quarter pound. 

I just dug into the bucket I toos the "odd" chunks of rock I pick up
into. I have here a rock that fits comfortably into my hand, and is of
typical track ballast size. It weighs 15 ounces. It\'s roughly 2.5" x
3.5" x 2.5". And for attack purposes, you\'d want something more in the
"fist sized" range. Which means it\'ll *easily* weigh one kilo.

>>  J = 108 x (36)^2 / 2011 = 70

J = 1000 * 36^2 / 2011 = 645

>>  DV = (70 x .735 / 5 )^.5 = 3

I\'ve got no idea what the ".735" in this is, so I can\'t complete the
calc. 

But I can tell you from personal experience that a fist sized rock
*tossed casually* gave me several stitches and almost gave me a
concussion.

Conside the skull as armor, and use the "blunt trauma damage" rules if
the rock can\'t penetrate.

ps. the two inch  rock is just about the right size for a sling. And a
trainer slinger with a rock that size *will* kill you. :-)

Ooo! La, la! ;->

Now, returning the subject to "null development in key areas" of Traveller
technology...who, besides me, has worked/is working out development
sequences to take increasing TL\'s into account?

Here\'s what I\'ve done with StutterWarp (yes I know it\'s altertech, but it\'s
what *I* use), just the first pass:

 E = Desired warp Efficiency in 30,000 km hexes/minute.
  
 MW = Vol_Ship * (E/TL)^3 (estimated)
 
 Warp_Vol = 20 + (60/TL) * (MW)^.5 
 
 Surface Area = Warp_Vol/2  
 
 Mass = 2 * Warp_Vol
 
 Cost = Warp_Vol * (3.6/TL)
 
 Final efficiency...
 
 Unloaded E = TL * (MW/unloaded_Mass)^.5
 
 Loaded E = TL * (MW/loaded_Mass)^.5

With these formula you have to look at trade-offs between cost and
performance, and the the trade-offs change at different TL\'s.  Larger ships
can actually get higher pseudo-velocities for the same volume, but costs
and power needed *rapidly* go through the roof...especially for large
ships.

I\'m looking to do the same sort of thing with all the technologies.

Slight problem. A picosend is 10^-12 seconds. So that 10^15 W beam is
only delivering 1 kilojoule. Or about the energy of a firecracker...

design of a 300,000 T passenger liner. Bear in mind that there are several
possible sources for errors: The figures for the hull was arrived at by
taking a 3000 T hull and multiply all figures by 100. This certainly can\'t
be exactly right, but I hope it is good enough to get close. Also, crew
requirements are bound to be distorted. 

The figures I came up with was: Price of ship (without discount): MCr78,400;
crew: 2000; passengers: 58,000 (Mid passengers only).

To calculate the price of a starship ticket, figure out the yearly operating
expenses of a ship (including a fair profit to provide a return for the money
invested in the ship) and divide it by the number of passengers carried over
the year.

Expenses:

Crew salaries: For this I\'ve ssumed four different categories of crew:
Command, Crew, Medic, and steward. I\'ve assumed the following average
monthly salaries: Command: Cr7,500, Crew: Cr5,000, Medic: Cr2,500,
Steward: Cr1,250 (This corresponds roughly to an average skill of 2.5).
Yearly payroll: Mcr 66.315000
Crew life support: 2201*2000*35 = 154,070,000
Passenger life support: 3,654,000,000
Maintenance: 78,400,000.

Operating expenses (Based on 35 jumps/year and 90% utilization):
                      
Crew salaries:           66,315,000	(0.7%)
Crew life support:      154,070,000	(1.7%)
Passenger life supp.: 3,654,000,000  	(39.9%)
Maintenance:             78,400,000	(0.9%)
Fuel (At Cr300/T):      315,000,000	(3.4%)
Payments & profit:    4,900,000,000	(53.4%)
- ----    
                      9,167,785,000	(100%)  


Assuming the ship makes 35 jumps per year and is 90% full on the average,
it will carry 1,827,000 passengers each year. Dividing that up into the
yearly expenses will give you a cost of a Mid Passage of Cr 5,018.

Note that passenger life support is far too expensive IMO. If you reduce
them to something reasonable you can easily shave another Cr1000 off the
price. Also, maintenance, bank payments and profit is based on a ship
price that assumes the ship is a one off. If it is part of a class of
ship and gets, say, 20% discount, you can reduce the price of a ticket
by another Cr500.

What if most of the matter in the universe is not stars but weak

Conjecture is never weak, it is just conjecture.  Until we getter better

Hmm, I was working with the Data Marc sent around some time ago (still
available on Joe Hecks page). In this data some of the names have been
changed again, along them Santry and Cordova (as they are not in the
list anymore...). If you know where they *should* be (as this is still a

According to M:0, Santry is located at 1736, and Cordova at 1836...but
some say this is not right... Any comments anyone?

OK, astronomers come up with atheory for galaxy formation. Then they test
it versus known physical laws such and find that their galaxies should blow
apart.
They could:

1) Think that perhaps their galaxy formation, estimate of galactic mass etc
is in err

2) Invent a new kind of mass that doesn\'t interact trough light and doesn\'t
correspond to anything detected that will save their theories. They dub
this new type of mass as dark matter (no, dark matter isn\'t brown dwarfs,
interstellar hydrogen etc - it doesn\'t interact with light at all, neither
for observation nor heating/heat transfer.

Number 2 is IMO not allowed when doing science, you\'re not allowed to
invent unobservable phenomena to save an experimantally unsound theory.

What if someone wanted his neat theories of a flat earth remain despite
observational data of suns angle at different locations etc. He could then
postulate a lightbending property to the earth such that all curvature
effects derived from it. He then postulates that this bending field is
impossible to detect by any other means. Why should this scientific trick
be less correct than the one done by cosmologists?

This is off-topic so I\'ll shut my mouth about this unless someone want to
continue this on e-mail.

   It would be, except that the truth is even more bizarre.  The Army for
years had fixed wing aircraft (and still might, my info is a little dated).
They were strictly used for observation and were unarmed.  At various points
the Army tried to get armed, fixed wing aircraft but the projects
were--sorry for the pun--shot down by the Air Force.  A few years back the
Air Force finally offered up its fleet of aging A-10s to the Army, which
said thanks but no thanks (sort of like the way you turn down the offer of a
1985 Jaguar with 500,000 km, noticeable rust, and an unexplained fluid leak).

In the October 1997 issue of Scientific American, in the "Science and the
Citizen" section there is an interesting article about other reasons for the
disbelief in evolution.  The guy who studied this was looking for specific
non-religious rationales, and he came across a number of beliefs that tended
to repeat themselves:

* That mutations are always harmful, never beneficial.
* That methods used in dating things are incorrect.
* That, as a result of the above two things, evolution is a statistical
impossibility.

I can see where the author\'s coming from here, because I\'ve had a number of
discussions on evolution with people who are apparently "educated" who have
seriously skewed beliefs about evolution.

The convention forbids the use of "human shield." I think this includes
stationing an ammo dump next to unlawful targets - so it is forbidden.

<sarcasm>
But, in the era of smart  bombs, the question is irrevelant. The almighty
U.S.A.F. can put the bomb through the ventilation shafts of the ammo dump,
the building next to it doesn\'t get a scratch.

Like in Iraq, with B-52s...

On the subject of the 40 days of Big Rain...

    There was a show on Discovery recently about the biblical flood myth. It
came to the conclusion that the deluge was actually the flooding of the
Black Sea. Apparently the Bosphorus was a dam holding back the
mediterranean. It eroded, or was fractured by a quake and a huge wall of
water flowed into the black sea region. There was a much smaller sea there
beforehand with a level well below mean sea level.

    I\'ve no other evidence other than that reported on the tube. Thought it
might help settle the issue.

BTW. Would it be possible to create a Saturn type ring of water/ice at very
low earth orbit. I\'m "at sea" on this but is there not a point just above
the high atmostphere where the temperature rises above freezing and liquid
water would be possible? Something to do with solor wind, I think?

On the subject of the pan-galactic church... (all opinion)

    The long night was a period of isolation for many systems where
pan-galatic political systems were absent. In this arena, old beliefs would
resurge. If there was a corresponding failing of technology/sciences, then
more basic human needs for salvation, hope and succour would arise. Religion
would almost certainly become the more dominant social gel. After the long
night passed, the newfound faith would decline somewhat in the face of
advance of tech and extraplanetary exposure, but would be, by that time,
entrenched.
    The indigenous religions that existed on worlds before the Long Night,
however minor or however subdued, would soon grow to be world encompassing.
While not the case for all worlds, it would certainly be a not insignificant
fraction of all worlds that would emerge from the long night with theocratic
elements in their social, if not political make-up. It would be like Europe
emerging from the Dark ages. There were many kingdoms, with differing
political make-ups, but all under the watchful eye of Mother Church.
    It may even be possible that this diverse collections of worldly
churches, through an enligthened ecumenical movement emerging at "dawn",
could develop into a single larger unified church with pan-Imperium
influence.

    Like I said at the top, this is based on opinion (I got a D+ in Canon
101). If anyone likes the idea and they have a good grasp of Canon, I\'d
appreciate any details they could supply to flesh out the "Unified Church of
the Celestial Sphere" (GUCCS)

Actually, YES.  War is a gentleman\'s aggreement to blown the shit out of
each other to the max extent possible. 

And if they bio NYC Bahghad fries.

Contrary to idealism, _might_ does make right because there is no other
arbiter or enforcer.  To ignore that simple fact is to ignore history
and endage your populace.  Governments know this, and it is why most
behave the way they do.

This is a gross misunderstanding on your part. Dark matter is just a name
for some form of matter (ie. mass) that has to be in galaksies to explain
their movement and interaction. What it is is not known, but it could be
brown dwarfs, black holes, interstellar gas, planets, neutrinos with mass,
other exotic partikles yet to be discovered, or something totally
different. Why do you say that it dosen\'t interact with light at all? Do
you have any references to this?

Totally agree, but that is not what has happened here. The astronomers has
just plainly postulated that there has to be more matter present in
galaxies than what we so far has observed, this matter is not yet
observable and is therefor dim/dark, hence dark matter.

Yep.  This is the same way that the neutrino was discovered.  
IIRC it was basically conceived to fill the hole in spin (?) for beta
decay.  Sometimes handwaving works.

Galactic formation simulations treat it as totally transperant to all
radiation and without temperature, to me that rules out all of "brown
dwarfs, black holes, interstellar gas, planets, neutrinos with mass,other
exotic partikles yet to be discovered" but "neutrinos with mass or other
exotic partikles yet to be discovered".
As the last two are just fancy namnes for nondetectable stuff at least in
the case of galaxy simulation astronomers what I originally said holds,
maybe other astronomers have a different meaning to the tem which is just
as bad science: undefined terms.

And I suggest that you make your own decision long before you ever get 
to the point of having to make the decision as to obey or disobey an 
order.  I had that firmly established in my mind and heart before even 
taking my oath of office as an Officer of Marines.  I was ready to 
disobey per my conscience/beliefs regardless of the consecquences so 
that I would not have to try to make that decision under duress.

Is anyone aware of how the city-bombing campaigns actually got started?

In 1940, when the Luftwaffe started the Battle of Britain, they concentrated
on purely military targets...in this case the RAF airfields and radar
stations.  Most of these installations were in very sparsely-settled areas or
in areas with low population densities.  Then after one raid, a damaged German
bomber (who\'s pilot was unsure of his exact position) had to jettison his load
to stay in the air.  Since he was lost, and blackout was in effect, he didn\'t
realize he was violating Goerring\'s express orders....he was over London at
the time.  The very next night, RAF Bomber Command launched it\'s first raid on
Berlin.  Hitler, of course, was furious and immediately ordered the Luftwaffe
to begin bombing cities in England to the detriment of all other targets.

This saved England actually...the RAF was very nearly destroyed at that time
and probably would have ceased organized resistance w/in 2 weeks.  The change
in targeting gave them time to rebuild and reorganize.

A curious thing though...if the bomber had not dropped it\'s load and simply
crashed, the damage would have been greater...but no one would have bombed
cities over it.

I am the originator of the textual references to Santry and Cordova in M0.
My text indicates that Santry and Cordova are a few jumps apart. However in
FS someone put them (a) right next to each other, and (b) within the
Chestine Kingdom (?). As the M0 book predates the FS book I consider FS to
be in error. (Although some could argue that it is later, therefore
corrects M0.)
     I had no specific location in mind when I wrote the bit for M0. Just
some simple astrography. Since then, at someone\'s request, I\'ve been look
at Core sector with the idea of finding a more appropriate place for them
in agreement with the published text. Currently I\'m favouring the Jump-1
main in the bottom of the Cemplas and Chant subsectors. With Santry at 1328
(currently Sar), and Cordova at 1730 (currently Laik Girkki). More or less
all of the main in Cemplas is Santrian (except 1630), and in Chant is
Cordovian.
     This fits the texts where the worlds are a few jumps apart. It has
Cordova on the end nearest the Imperium. The Pop digits from FS make for a
hopeless cluster, though. To gel with a Pocket Empire that is any use at
all they either have to be changed, or assumed that these are after heavy
"pacification". [The additional unpublished material I have on
Santry/Cordova indicates there was at least one planetary wipeout
bombardment (for you relativistic rock fans) which, of course, each side
blames the other for.]
     One alternative I am considering is Santry as 1531 (currently Emsha
I), but that this is no longer the capital of the Santrian Empire. A number
of other worlds and some more detailed astrography are mentioned in the
unpublished material. I keep meaning to devote some time into editing the
FS data into something that fits with this material. If there is a general
degree of interest, I might be able to move some things forward.

I disagree...there is a large amount of convincing evidence that Hitler truly
wanted a negotiated settlement w/ England...there was also a large faction of
English nobility who apparently wanted an alliance w/ the Nazis (Prince
Edward??)  In my view, indiscrimate bombing of civilian targets would have
made that impossible. Also, a point I forgot to bring up is that most likely
at the time Hitler issued the targeting order, he probably didn\'t know London
had been bombed, even accidently, or else it was simply Allied propaganda
justifying the RAF raids...thats how he\'d have done it (remember the radio
station at Gliewicz??)

Easily possible for the Solomani (medical TL16, C.1110).

One of the plots in my campaign (which I borrowed slightly from a scenario in 
Challenge) involved a plan by high-ranking, and slightly over-zealous, Solomani 
officers to release a geneered virus on the liberated worlds to cleanse them of 
any impure contamination...

They used two different viri, tailored to only affect non-Solomani. Infection 
by either one produces flu-like symptoms, infection by both kills within 48 
hours. The viri were to be released on different worlds, near A starports. That 
way, they would rapidly spread from world to world, and by the time people 
started dying millions would be infected by one or the other.

That\'s one of those methods that *might* work, *if you\'re lucky.* 
Unfortunately, it must work *100%*. As others have said, nuking would do 
it, but it wouldn\'t be the most popular decision ever made...

   Try comparisons between things that can be compared to each other next

by the Iraqis on the US just doesn\'t work on *multiple* levels.

   War has no rules, save perhaps being worried what your neighbors will

   Mostly likely scenario?  Sadaam is hunted down like a dog and executed,
along with the entire leadership of Iraq.  Iraq is then partioned into
several other countries (the Kurds finally get that homeland they wanted,
along with the Assyrians, Shiites, etc.), and if the Iraqi people are lucky,
the US will stop just short destorying every city in the country with a
population over 10,000...and the laser guided muntions would be put in
storage for this occasion.

   Harold\'s personal preference for additional punishment: all of the former
Iraq\'s oil receipts for the next century go to the survivors of NYC and
their families.

Okay, so this is based on surface-to-surface, Jump-1 travel, correct? What
is the profit margin you are figuring (just curious)?

[Three snips]

Okay, this is where things start to get tricky. The thing that generated
this post (besides the nearly hysterical desire to talk about something
Traveller as opposed to CE/BCE/AD/BC/AM/PM/PMS/QED/blah blah blah religion
blah blah blah) was your post on passenger traffic levels. Would most
routes have enough traffic on them to actually warrant one of these
passenger liners? At least in Regina\'s case, this doesn\'t seem to be so.
With the nubers you posited, I don\'t think you could get a 90% occupancy on
one of these liners in the Regina region -- the traffic levels simply don\'t
allow it. Of course, all of the numbers are squishy, but I thought they
were pretty good estimates.

So passenger liners in the 300,000+ ton range are restricted to routes
between really high pop (9+) worlds within jump-1 of each other? Assuming
the Regina hub is relatively average in the Imperium (is it? I haven\'t
looked at the Imperium in that closely), that would make big liners pretty
rare, even given the economy of scale. Would you agree?

So the really big ones would be rare -- I suppose there is an intermediate
range between the Type R and the really big ships that would be the best
option. Hmm.

[A dollar!]

Okay, so let\'s be optimistic and say a mid passage costs Cr 3,500. Round
trip that\'s 7,000 Cr -- still a huge chunk of change for the average person
(at $3=1Cr, it\'s a trip *I* certainly couldn\'t afford without saving for
several years). Does anyone know what it costs to get round-trip tickets on
the QE2? Or any modern trans-Atlantic passenger liner, for that matter? I\'m
just trying to get a feel for how big a deal jump travel is for the average
person in the Imperium.

I am getting the impression that it is big deal. :-)

This is a "last call" for bug fixes and enhancement requests - I\'m going to
be unable to work on the spreadsheet for a while, so I\'d like to try and get
everything working to most everyone\'s satisfaction.

The following bugs/features have been fixed/added:
    EXCEL ONLY: Added the SaveDesign and LoadDesign macros, to save the ship
in a "lighter" text format, to conserve disk space. SaveDesign is called by
ctrl+s, LoadDesign is called by ctrl+l.
    Fixed PA and Meson damage values based on FFS2 errata.
    Fixed backup fuel purification plants.
    Fixed fuel cost on economics page.
    Fixed Screen crew count - wasn\'t including damper turrets.
    Fixed crew totals - wasn\'t including screens.
    Fixed drive and magzine problems on missile sheet 2.
    Fixed atmospheric speeds.
    Changed hull pricing again (at Bruce Macintosh\'s request). Hull paint
credits are based on percentages, as beforebut the costs for military black
and ultrablack are back to the original method - based on hull area and a
fixed cost.
    Changed the TLSet macro code to be more efficient. Thanks to "Simon" for
sending me the new code.
    Split code into Excel and Quattro Pro versions for better macro support.

If anyone is aware of more bugs, or has a feature request - please email
them to me at igor@ames.net so that I can work on it in the next day or two
and then put it to rest for a while.

As soon as 2.1 is ready, I\'ll notify the list.

   It is fairly easy to get the total number of passengers, all you do is
have the Imperial Military forces muster out 304,500 people per year who
are at least 6 jump ones away from their homeworld.  If they all had TAS
they would be able to afford the six trips within a year.  Mind you a lot
of them might choose to arrange accidents for the crew, in order to get
a working passage. :-)

You\'re reminding me of the \'Yes Minister\' sketch when the UK Civil Service

 I would want darn good stewards on a ship of this class.  This mid passage
thing seems like a means to get the ship more profitable.  If it were not
mid passengers then you would need to find 29,000 passengers paying the 
usual rate 10,000 and still be better off than 5018cr per ticket.  The only
problem comes with filling the ship - 3625 Stewards level 8 would probably
do this, gaining a minimum of 8 passengers per steward, but I do not know if
this old rule was cumulative.

    'body' => 'Someone was mentioning the QE2 and other ships, I wanted to relate a campaign construction idea I had heard:

Space Travel, and how it affects your campaign, can be easily related (at least for example purposes) to eras in Earth history - in particular, how hard it was to cross the Atlantic in that era. This will tell you something about why people travel, how common travel is, etc.

Prehistory: Perhaps a handful of people have made the crossing, their exploits lost in myth and legend. No one would know how to deliberately begin such an undertaking, and it is generally believed to be impossible.

16th century and before: Very dangerous, expect to lose entire ships with regularity, it will be a rare vessel that makes the crossing without fatalities. Say your farewells, even if things go perfectly it will be a long time before you see your loved ones again. Terrible conditions during the voyage. Expect, if successful, that your voyage will be newsworthy throughout your civilization. Result: Generally only governments take the risk of the voyage. Few will agree to do it twice, or even once, and those who make the journey may well be inclined not to come back.

17th to 18th Century: Hazards still exist, travel is not to be taken lightly but is safe enough that people do it for profit. Still, it is an uncommon and somewhat special person who makes the trip regularly, for the most part due to the conditions during the voyage - conditions that wealth will have little effect upon. Result: Still it will be governments in charge of or at least involved with most voyages. A class of people who make a living at making the crossing emerges as an elite group.

19th Century (especially later) to early 20th Century: The trip is safe, but long. Improvements in the way travel is done make wealth a useful thing for improving conditions, therefore wealthy travellers become some of the prime passengers on these voyages. While making the crossing may still be a once in a lifetime adventure for most, it has ceased to be a noteworthy event. Results: Big businesses take over the ships that make the voyage, though there will be private craft (and even personal craft) that make the trip. Governments will start to codify regulations for the safety of those making the voyage.

Mid-Twentieth Century to Late Twentieth Century: The hazard factor of the voyage has dropped to nearly zero. Common people make the trip in comfort, and many are so accustomed to the trip that they do not consider it a disruption to undertake it. Procedures are so well established that the trip can be made with little or no planning (presenting oneself at a transport terminal and buying a ticket). Results: Plans (financial, military, or clandestine) with elements occuring at either end of the voyage are commonplace. Businesses cease to consider themselves as being primarily focused at one end of the voyage or the other. The occaisional disaster, though statistically insignificant, is given elevated notice by the media and the populace.


Use for Traveller? Decide which era your universe\'s star flight compares to for ease, safety, etc. Is travelling from one world to another like hopping Pan Am, boarding the liner Olympia, or like signing the crew roster of the Santa Maria? This willl also give you a feel for how likely the "average" citizen is to have travelled in space, and how final a decision like joining a new colony would be.


Just some thoughts...

FS data definitely gives the wrong place for them! This puts them right on
the border of the Chanestin Kingdom, which would have absorbed them. Not to
mention that the Imperium rolls over Keshi in Y2, and by Y0 the Imperium
was involved in using Cordova to annexe Santry. The description in the text
on p24 suggests that S and C are at least three J2\'s apart. I would suggest
moving them to Cluster around 1322 or maybe 1233.

I talked to Jo Grant (who wrote the stuff on the Cluster), who said that FS
placed them wrong and he would have to look for a new location for them.

1912 US dollars) were; 1st class: about $4000 round trip!, 2nd; about 1/3 to a
1/4 of that, and steerage was maybe a hundred or two tops. Granted this ship
was MUCH more expensive than usual, but in Traveller terms, what about
lowering middle passage costs , and introducing a 2000 Cr steerage class? It
is safer than cold sleep, and I bet for a one jump (1 week) journey, one could
design smaller accomodations than the double compartment (maybe a quad, with
bunk beds?). I also think that steerage would need less stewards. This would
make large liners more profitable for short one jump runs, and from what I
remember the immmigrant steerage tickets were the shipping lines "bread and
butter". The more "traditional" Traveller designs appear to be better suited
to long multijump runs where the passengers would more likely to be wealthy,
and want high passage luxuries and more space (and these NPC\'s would usually
make more interesting characters than the steerage class proles). A good
adventure nugget could be a ship violating Imperial board of Trade regulations
by exceeding maximum passenger levels (ie., selling steerage tickets on
multijump voyages).

issue.  The price of anything is independant of the cost.  The
price depends on the market.  Prices will vary depending on how
many people want to go to the destination and how many ships make
the trip.  Prices along a Jump 1 main will probably be lower while
prices for tickets to a world at the end of a J-4 leg may be
much higher.  If the J-4 world is a highly desirable destination,
though, enough ships may make the trip that the price may come
down.  The only real effect price has is it sets a minimum.  In
a highly efficient market where ships can quickly change routes
to meet demand, the price will generally be equal to the cost
plus some reasonable return on investment (whatever the general
return on investment is).  This ignores the effects of any
mnoopolies or non-market trade restrictrions.  It would be
useful to know the costs involved with the various passages as
well as the next most profitable use of the space (cargo, mail,
etc...) for comparison.  It would also be useful to discuss the
various passenger lines and where they typically go.  Prices
for passage where big commercial lines run will be lower than
prices to other systems.

Well, what level of staffing is there on the QE2 or the average cruise
ship? That, I think, would be the most valid model to use here. IMHO the 8
High passage/steward is for relatively small ships.

I know I\'m chiming in late, but I thought I\'d present my own picture of
mining in Glisten asteroid belt;

There are several medium sized (2000-5000 ton) processing stations in orbit
just inside the outer asteroid belt (this is the ground for smaller belters
to make money.  the larger corporations use the inner belt - where the main
starport and "mainworld" is - in a larger scale mining method).

Being in a slightly smaller orbit, the stations are a bit faster than the
asteroids in their revolutions.  This allows miners along the belt to store
up ore and deliver it to the closest station when it gets relatively close.

The station itself is mostly a fusion smelting facility.  Ore is processed
in the central section - also the location of a "company store" to resupply
the miners - at a premium of course.  The refined "ingots" are then
packaged for delivery by the 1/2 kilometer mass driver.  Note that the mass
driver can use gravitic technology rather than electromagnetic, to allow
nonferrous materials being \'shot\'.

The Mass driver is paired with an identical device pointed in the opposite
direction.  IF the station propelled a 50 ton ingot in one direction the
corresponding force would change it\'s desirable orbit significantly.  Each
ingot is equipped with a beacon to enable its capture at the other end and
the ballistic trajectory is carefully designed to take advantage or orbital
braking as it nears Glisten Habitat - the marketplace to which these goods
are being delivered.

The ingot is fired at as high a velocity as possible.  There is no need to
limit acceleration with no passengers.  Simultaneously an ingot of "slag"
material is launched outwards, withits own beacon to aid in navigation.
These waste ingots are rarely heard from again.

Travel time is generally measured in months - 18 - 24 in general.

To answer the question, yes, this can result in a serious danger to the
fragile outer space habitats in the Glisten system.  Many safety checks are
made by experienced professionals and complex computers before every shot,
and Glisten Mining assures the public that no mishaps could possibly occur
;).

[Gee, doesn\'t that sound like an adventure hook?]

Belters mine the asteroids, extracting raw ore and delivering it in low
acceleration "buggys" of 200 to 1000 tons.  These craft are mostly cargo
hold, with a small pressurized living area.  Belters spend most of their
time outside in their vacc suits running mining equipment.  Explosives
would be rarely used since it would put an unwanted vector on the asteroid
in question.  Mostly the techniques are strictly drilling and melting the
materials into movable chuncks.  One very useful invention is the
"minithruster" which allows a miner to move a cargo-bay sized chunck of
rock to his or her ship at a tiny fraction of a gee.  Many mishaps have
been the result of a piece of rock\'s mass being underestimated by a
careless miner.

Another technique is to simply collect the dust and debris found in any
belt.  This is usually done by specialized craft and can be quite
profitable.

Note that minig using a seeker is really just prospecting.  Seekers have
jump drives and are completely unable to compete with local vessels under
the same circumstances.  Although seekers will bring back samples, the
cargo bay is usually filled with instruments and equipment for collecting
and marking finds.  An independent may then rent space in a large cargo
ship to transport a portable minig setup similar to the above so that he is
eventually transporting nothing but completely refined minerals to the
nearest market.  More likely the prospector will sell his or her claim to
one of the large or medium sized mining companies for a share in the
profits.

Enough!

So, can we then assume that Syleans have a traditional inclination against
bathing and hygiene (which keeps their medical TL from advancing too quickly)?
What about fondness for cheese, snails and wine?  And not letting allies fly

Doesn\'t  this mean that "Sylea" should be pronounced "Silly?"  And thus, this

The same reason they did so in the 18th century and before (and after for
that matter); Business & Leisure.

Economic opportunity, consultation, scientific conferences, curiosity,
visiting family, emigration to new job markets, etc. etc.  The number of
people desiring and capable of affording travel should be dependent on the
population of the source planet.

Dr. Landen

Introduction

   I subscribed to the Traveller Mailing List (TML) to observe the behavior
of a group of typical science-fiction role-playing game enthusiasts.  I
conducted observations over a three week period and kept detailed notes on
what I saw.

Summary

   These people are nuts.

Detailed Report

   I mean it, these people should be locked up.  They are loco, looney, and
certifiable in every sense of the word.  It\'s amazing that mental health
authorities haven\'t seized the name and address information of the whole lot
from their Internet service providers and had them all put away for their
own protection.  You have paranoia, delusional behavior, schizophrenia, and
manic depression being exhibited, and that was just the first digest of
messages I received.  It truly worries me that these people may have access
to bell towers and firearms, or worse yet, members of the opposite sex
willing to breed with them.  This group represents the single most
convincing argument for sterlizing the mentally ill that I have ever seen.

Conclusion

   Be afraid, be very afraid, so long as these people are allowed to roam free.

From what I remember, memory plastics were hard plastics that could be
shaped into a form, then blased with something like microwaves to fix them
in their shape. But, when boiled in water, they would become pliable again
and could be mashed into another shape. This latter action, though, just
twisted the molecues (or whatever) and didn\'t reform them, so there was
still the "memory" of the original shape. When subjected to physical shocks
(like rapping on a table) the molecules would reshift, and move pack toward
their original configuration.
     In the supplement, I think there were knives that were made of this.
Once boiled they could be mashed into abstract jewelry. Later they could be
brought back to their more lethal form.
     I wouldn\'t imagine they are that high a tech level. Say 10. The cost,
as with most plastics, should not be high where complex hydrocarbons are
readily available and an industrial base exists.

     In my own game, I\'ve extended this idea slightly for the body pistol.
This weapon is made from memory plastic. It also has the characteristic of
having the same profile as flesh on most standard imperial scanners. So it
can be boiled, squashed, and concealed about one\'s person in a variety of
locations. When restored to its original form, it is capable of firing two
shots. However the first sets off a chain reaction within the material such
that within 60 seconds the entire gun has completely evaporated and, after
5 minutes, not even traces of the vapour are left that can be detected
forensically.
     Needless to say they are HIGHLY illegal.

     Plenty of ideas for budding materials scientists there...

Well, I\'m not a "real Brain, but I have (as ussual) an opinion, hopefully
based on scientifically correct facts.

It would be smooth and comfortable.

A Jupiter sized planet has gravitational pull of (let\'s say) 3 times that
of the Earth.  this means that if you are at the same distance from the
center of the Earth as the Earth\'s crust is and are standing on a surface
you will feel like you have your two twin brothers on your back.

This fact is not pertinent to passengers in a spaceship orbiting the
planet.  Ships and other objects in orbit are in "free fall" and the force
of gravity is acting on the whole ship and its contents equally as the ship
"falls" "around" the planet in question.  If the ship chooses to use it\'s
manuver drive then the force from that drive *will* be acting apon the
passengers.

Now, let\'s talk about scooping fuel.  There are several possibilities that
I can see, but I\'ll give you my own opinion of the process.

The atmosphere of any planet (that has an atmosphere) is thicker as you go
deeper into it and thinner as you increase your distance from the surface.
At a certain point the atmosphere will be only a few thousand molecules per
cubic meter (quite thin, in other words) and it is at this level that a
starship will refuel.

My theory is this; a refueling ship needs to retain as much of its kinetic
energy as possible, after all, energy is time, and we all know what time
is.  The least-time method I can think of is keeping in the thinner reaches
of the atmosphere and at a high speed so that the ship effectively "rams"
the sparse molecules of Hydrogen into the fuel scoops\' openings (which may
be augmented by magnetic fields since the upper atmosphere\'s hydrogen is
bound to be ionized and therefore subject to magnetic forces).  Since the
atmosphere through which the ship is passing is relatively thin, turbulence
is at a minimum.

Now, if our space shuttle tried to do this at the speeds I am imagining, it
would probably be burned up, the heat buildup is well resisted by TL 11+
materials in the hull (which, hopefully, outperform the Molybdenum of the
Shuttle\'s tiles significantly).

Once the tanks are full and busy refining the Hydrogen (and Deuterium,
Helium, Nitrogen, etc.), the ship thrust itself to a higher orbit, and
begins the long \'burn\' (an old term probably still used) to take it to
escape velocity (hopefully), probably planning to use the planet to
\'slingshot\' out to jump point in the process.

My only quesiton for the bigger heads is this; Is there a problem getting a
1G merchant to Jupiter\'s escape velocity?  Or is it just a matter of time
and thrust?

Well, he actually believed that conquering \'Russia would get him a

On the other hand, attacking Russia was part of his master-plan from the

	Material so far included, 99% of the TML and Xboat lists. Software for IBM
and Atari (there\'s supposed to be some MAC material on the way to), these are
various character generators, sectors generators/viewers, some demo games, the
Traveller Navigator software including Travelcomp. Plus other minor utilities.
	Sector maps, including ones for 1120 and 1200.
	Four chats with DGP and GDW.
	Some old playtest works.
	A couple of utility programs for the IBM (grep and a unix-to-dos and dos-to-
unix file convertors). I found an indexing program that looked good to but was
unable to download it (it was on ZDnet).
	Ship and vehicle designs galore, mostly MT though. TNE, classic and T4 would
need to be pulled from the various digests.
	Deckplans, world maps.
	Old HIWG working documents.
	One set of library data.

it.

No, but if you hum a few bars I can fake it...

Not that one, but a similar case is mentioned in the biography of premier
forensic pathologist Dr Milton Hepburn, "Where Death Delights..."

Seems a man shot his wife in back of the skull, the roud skimmed around inside
and exited the entry hole (she was killed), hitting the guy in the shoulder
and wounding him badly enough the cops found them both lying on the floor.

I have a 2 year old daughter. One of her favorite games is to sit down with

	I believe the idea was to restrict the "combat rifleman" skill, which
gives skill with ALL kinds of longarms, to military. Others (non-military)
don\'t get the intense, general training but just learn on a specific style
of weapon. However, it *should* be available to most Army or Marine
characters.

	I believe God created the universe. I also believe that the intelligence
with which he gifted us reveals evidence the universe predates 4004 BC by
quite a bit. So *if* God created the universe in 4004 BC, he put in
evidence that it was much older, and hence perhaps might want us to believe
it\'s much older ... I also note that the book of Genesis has two
contradictory creation myths--if it\'s the literal truth, one of them MUST
be wrong, and hence it cannot be the literal truth ...

 I suppose this makes me an accomplice to unsubscription?  Is that an Imperial
crime, or does it fall under planetary jurisdiction?

	REALLY????? Where can I find such a member of the opposite sex? I like
them tall, well educated, intelligent, non-anorexic figure, and preferably
not too ditzy. I\'m single, employed, somewhat old-fashioned and liberal
simultaneously, quite undernourished, and have a slightly off-the-wall

	When I moved back to the U.S. from Germany, one of redneck\'s in my class
decided my nickname should be "Hitler" ... but then I went to Redneck High,
so it was par for the course. Needless to say, he never earned any
attention from me.

There are increasing numbers of direct evidence for dark matter on
various scales. The LLNL MACHO microlensing project found dark objects
in our galaxie\'s halo, with overall density basically consistent with 
the amount of dark matter predicted by "galactic spin rates" (big error
bars, but clearly inconsistent with zero - there\'s definitely quite a 
bit of dark junk in the halo. We have no good idea what it is, though.

On large scales, the canonical number for the amount of dark matter
in galaxy clusters at least roughly agrees with the predictions of
how much "conventional" matter there should be based on Big Bang
nucleosynthesis.

So it\'s not quite as bad as Anders implies...

the basis of galactic rotation it\'s pretty clear that 90% of the mass of our
galaxy has to be dark (somehow, unless the law of gravity isn\'t what we think
of); this could easily be compact objects (brown dwarfs/MACHOs.) On the basis
of the motions of galaxies inclusters it\'s also clear that 99% of the mass of
clusters is dark - which could, again, be MACHOs, or something more exotic.
Possibly coincidently this is the same number you get if you ask "how much
conventional matter was present (just after) the big bang"?

The kind of dark matter you seem to be objecting to most is the kind that 
gets put into galaxy formation scenarios - it\'s true that it\'s hard to
make the kind of galaxies and clusters we see, given what we know (from COBE)
about post-big-bang conditions, using the known matter in the form of gas.
One thing that helps is "cold dark matter", which doesn\'t interact with ordinary
matter except gravitationally. This could still be "conventional" matter; on
astronomical scales, rocks don\'t interact except gravitationally, for example
(though it\'s hard to form rocks right after the big bang.) Or it could be
neutrinos - there are lots of neutrinoes left over from the big bang, and if
they have even a tiny mass they make great cold dark matter. Given that we
had the gravitational evidence (see paragraph 1) about dark matter in galaxies and
clusters, positing Yet More dark matter didn\'t actually seem that unreasonable.

Geeze! Not around here.  I was down on the tracks just the other day and

Heck, if I know either, do you know what the 2011 is? IAC, this is the

 g = 900   vel = 36m/s  diameter = 10cm

 J = 900 x (36)^2 / 2011 = 580

 DV = (580 x .735 / 10 )^.5 = 7

BTW, I\'m not arguing with you that a fist sized rock will hurt you badly,
kill you if you\'re unlucky. What I\'m saying is the the formula for the dv
see *too* low. This might be a problem with scaling at the low end.

Yeah, but with a sling you get a longer lever, so much higher velocity. I\'d
guess it is at least doubled, and that makes the smaller rock as damaging
as the larger one (7dv).

For those kinds of numbers inter-stellar travel would have to be as common
as inter-continental travel is today. For travel to be *that* common, the
price of a ticket needs to come down into the upper hundreds of
dollars..say 1/20th the 5000Cr price tag Hans quoted. Isn\'t a Concorde
ticket about $3000 (or 1000Cr)? 

I\'m not promoting those numbers, just suggesting they seem appropriate.

That\'s what I did. I allowed the "military" careers to have access to

Interesting question. I\'d suggest reactive cooling might have to be
employed.

Here\'s where there might be a problem. The full tanks contain a mixture of
elements, a percentage of which won\'t be useful as jump fuel (be it actual
fuel or reaction mass), so the ship will have to expell the gases it can\'t
use and skim more for refining, refine it, expell, skim, refine...until the
desired quantity of hydrogen, pure enough to qualify as refined fuel, is
obtained.  Either that or take on a good deal more gas to refine than it
will eventually need.

It doesn\'t sound so dumb to me Hal.  The universe does seem pretty curdled

The version I heard was that the Air Force decided they wern\'t going to
replace the old A-10s, and the Army sid that if the Air Force wouldn\'d
provide the support they needed (i.e. the A-10s), then they\'d do it
themselves. In order to prevent a precedent being set the Air Force then
decided that they would keep the A-10s in service after all.

I don\'t either, but a 1kg rock would do 2D6 in TNE, which is not that
different from the damage it gives - 1D6+STR

I know what you mean - I was hit by a practice granade, and if I hadn\'t
seen it coming and flinched I would\'ve lost teeth (as it was it hit in the
shoulder, and I couldn\'t use my left arm for two days).

IIRC the favoured projectile for a sling was a lead slug, about a inch in
diameter, which would weigh about a hundred grams. These sling bullets
killed a lot of people, even when they wore helmets.

My method with the Grand Unified Traveller Trade Theory was that a
starport\'s throughput was, by definition, related to the amount of
interstellar trade created by a world.

The amount of trade created depended on the profitibility of trading with
that world, with a fudge factor for "luxury exports", which were determined
essentially at random (eg worlds who export dustspice, natural gemstones,
\'48 Lafite and all that other high-value low-bulk stuff).

Starport quality had a positive effect on trade, because high-grade
starports make trade more profitable for both buyers and sellers, by
reducing the cost of bought goods and increasing the selling price of goods
via better broker availability.

The other way to go is to fix a kilo-per-person limit with starports - I
dunno, maybe 10 kilos per person on planet per week for an E port, and
going up by a factor of five per grade increase.

Sure, they can do as they wish. We would turn their country to
glass, but they\'re welcome to give it a go.

Frankly, we shouldn\'t bomb Iraq. We should let them know that they
are targeted with nukes, and that if they *use* CBN weapons on
anybody (even in Iraq) it will be treated as a CBN attack on us, and
they\'ll get nuked.

It worked for 50 years, it could work with Iraq (and would end this
stupid rhetoric-fest Saddam and Bill have been having).

I think this is what drives (ObTraveller :-) the fact that weapons
of mass destruction aren\'t used even in external wars in traveller.
It\'s a slope no one wants to start down.

No actually all this means is that 86% of those surveyed (and if the
survey was accurate & valid there is a 95% chance that the number is 86
+/- 3%) _said_ that they believed in a God or a Supreme Being.

People lie in surveys.  The more personal the question the more they
lie.  Peoples religious beliefs are personal.  It is quite possible that
people lie about their religious beliefs a lot.

These numbers cannot necessarily be considered valid.  They probably
have some vailidity.

No this survey said 51% _don\'t_ believe that humans evolved from lower
lifeforms.  This means that (subject to margins of error) no more than
49% can believe that humans did evolve from lower lifeforms.  Some
percentage of the surveyed population will not even know what
_evolution_ is and therefore any answers they give to this question,
either way, would be problematic at best.

Ob (Conspiratorial) Traveller: Obviously 9in the Traveller Universe) we
did _not_ evolve from lower animals unaided.  The Ancients took hominid
populations and messed with them.  Can we really be sure that this did
not include the hominid population left on Earth ?  After all we know
that Ancient sites have been found elsewhere in the solar system.  Maybe
the Imperium never found these Ancient sites because a conspiracy (or
conspiracies) existing prior to the founding of the Imperium was
covering up these sites...

At this time I would like to apologize to the Traveller mailing list for
introducing numerology (in the form of the Darmine faith) into our
Traveller discussions.  Kenji seems to have taken to it _too_ well,
possibly his writing about the Sayat is just a cover for his true
Darmine beliefs.

Besides using a simple numerological analysis we can clearly see that by
using the following system (A=1, B=2, C=3 . . . Z=26) 

Destroyer = 4 + 5 + 19 + 20 +18 +15 +25 + 5 + 18 = 129
	 	1 + 2 + 9 = 12
		1 + 2 = 3

Which is not significant

while

Templar = 20 + 5 + 13 + 16 + 12 + 1 + 18 = 85
		8 + 5 = 13
		1 + 3 + 4

Which, obviously, is significant	

To discover what the Templars control we will have too look at a
slightly bigger picture.

I note that

Imperium = 9 + 13 + 16 + 15 + 5 + 18 + 9 + 21 + 13 = 103
		1 + 0 + 3 = 4

I believe we have uncovered true extent of the Templar sphere of
influence.

	a starport has to handle freigth and passengers.

	for passengers, take the GNP multiply it with 1d6/1000, and you
	have the money of people who can afford a ticket. modify the %%
	at will to reflect government (e.g +2%% for democracies, -1%%
	for captative governments) you can make a table about.

	for freight we have maintenance and luxus.

	if techlevel>poplevel calculate capital and reinvestments.
	(10^techlevel) divided by (10^poplevel)*(2^maintmod) minus 1
	could be used for the minimum import necessary to sustain the
	techlevel.  if techlevel<=poplevel or the above formular gives a
	result less than 0, used 3d6%% as maintenance import. Luxus
	import is within the same range, or double range if its a rich
	system. Add military spending to the luxus import if the system
	feals low tech.

	Now we have one side only. Most systems will generate the same
	amount of exports as they have imports in Credits. For displacement
	tons traffic dont forget the "terms of trade" as in Merchant Prince.
	As the systems have not the same size, a large highpop system
	can produce a large amount of traffic distributed over other
	systems. If the area of distribution is larger than the techlevel
	of the subsector -10 (highest techlevel is allways military, next
	is advanced civilian, next is backwater) you also need to upgrade

Let me be a little less obtuse. Look at a normal (say fighter\'s) USD. It
doesn\'t have it\'s mass (just it\'s displacement). This means you have to
assume a typical mass if you want to calculate the number of support crew
for a predesigned carried craft. (Well, you could redesign it but that kind

Well skipping the physical stats I would say that the TML\'s UWP is

	A ???270-Z

Starport - People here build starships every week so obviously we have
an A port.

Population - Records show 100 + people on the list & 400 + on the
Digest, for a total of 500 +.  This is population level 2.

Government - No one government controls the TMl so obviously we are
government type 7 , Balkanized.  (Unless of course our secret Templar
puppet masters count as a government in which case we would be
government type 6.

Law Level - From the lack of control here I don\'t think I have to much
trouble justifying this one.

Tech Level - People here have knowledge & understanding of Ancient
Technology so our Tech Level is clearly at least Z :)

Sorry, but you are confusing two *different* uses of the term "dark
matter". What you are referring to is the way the term is used in
*cosmology*. In regulat astronomy, the term simply means "any matter in
a galaxy that isn\'t a star or bright nebula". 

> Number 2 is IMO not allowed when doing science, you\'re not allowed to
> invent unobservable phenomena to save an experimantally unsound theory.

Galactic mass *can* be measured. You just measure the velocity of other
galaxies orbiting it.

Where dark matter comes in with *galaxies* is that the stars that are
visible don\'t add up to the *measured* mass. And the velocities that
they move at inside the galaxy (again, a *measured* quantity) also
indicate that there\'s more mass in the galaxy than just the stars. 

This "missing mass" isn\'t unreasonably large, and we already know of
(or at least have good reasons to believe in) various things like brown
dwarfs that *can* explain it. And if it doesn\'t exist then you have to
come up with an explanation for why the law of gravity works
differently at some scales than at others. That\'s a *lot* messier than
just "assuming" that there\'s stuff we can\'t see.

This *is* relevant to Traveller, as it makes a difference in how much
"stuff" is likely to be between stars.

The "dark matter" the *cosmologists* talk about amounts to something
like 90% of the mass of the universe. *That* is a "handwave" that even
*they* aren\'t comfortable with. They are only willing to consider it
because if the "observable" mass (which includes the "dark matter" in
galaxies!) isn\'t that high, certain details regarding the big bang get
*truly* bizarre.

There\'s apparently been some recent research that measures the relative
motiuon of galactic clusters or some other "large scale" phenomenom
that seems to indicate that the "cosmological dark matter" *doesn\'t*
exist. In which case it *will* be thrown out the window, and they\'ll
have to try to explain how we got the current universe from a much less
massive big bang.

It also means that the universe would be open, which means that it\'s
gonna last for a *long* time. No cycling back to a "Big Crunch".

The bang *cannot* have been 100% uniform or we wouldn\'t *have*
galaxies. Once you allow enough uneeveness to form large scale

A little known fact is that they actually tried bringing *back* the
sling for use in throwing grenades back around ther turn of the
century.

I suspect that a *favorite* weapon of troops on world with a TL such
that they still had well trained slingers, would be grenades (when they
could get them). Traders could make a lot of money that way.

I know that Roman slingers went for a "spin once and release" rather
than the more standard 3-5 spins. So they could get by with even
"short" delays on the grenades. Even if they get the grenade off a bit
late, they\'ll at least have a nice "airburst" over the enemy troops.

Heck, now that I think about it, this sounds effective enough to
explain *why* the Imperal Army would be interested in "low TL" units. 

How would *you* like attacking a position defended by a few dozen
slingers with an ample stock of grenades? They ought to be able to drop
a grenade at your feet at a hundred yards or more. 

Other "low tech" fighters combined with the "right" high tech supplies
will be dangerous. Heck, a company of trained longbowmen would be
dangerous to 20th century troops. (Note: the Army actually has
crossbows available for snipers!)

Yep. 

Here\'s one for refs to use as justification for a *really*
lucky/unlucky character.

A guy sruck a .45 auto into his mouth and pulled the trigger. The
resulting muscle spasms resulted in the whole clip being fired. 

Believe it or not, he *survived*! The bullets went *between* the
hemispheres of the brain. They chewed the edges of of the hemispheres
up a bit, and removed most of the back of his skull. But no *serious*
brain damage occurred,. So he wound up with a metal plate in his head,
some reconstructive work on the inside of his mouth, and being a
failure at committing suicide.

6.25% pa. This is what the bank gets so for simplicity I made the owner\'s
profit the same. Although this will give the owner a slightly higher
effective return than the bank, the owner is running a greater risk
(since in the event of bankruptcy, the bank gets the ship), so I don\'t
think it is unreasonable. And it sure is simpler than different rates
of return for the two parties.

Propably not. Which is why I didn\'t give the ship a class discount.

So we can conclude that such ships won\'t be seen in the Regina region. I
don\'t see a problem with this. You might find one on the Rhylanor-Porozlo
run.

You could also have them on higher-jump routes. The crucial factor is
the number of passengers. Also, one ship will only allow departures
every 20 days. Even if you have that many passengers, it may be that
you\'d have 20 ships one 20th the size instead. The tickets would be
slightly more expensive, but only a few percent.

Yes.

Actually, I wouldn\'t propose such a ship for a Traveller module. Most
passenger liners would have a combination of large and small staterooms,
some of them capable of being combined into suites or fitted for double
occupancy, with enough cargo space to accomodate some High passengers.
They might also have some low berths and some bunks for Fast passengers
and Steerage passengers. The reason why I designed the ship for Mid
passengers only is that it makes it a lot easier to calculate the true
cost of a ticket. I\'ve done a whole set of 600 T ship designs for each
jump distance from 1 to 6, each dedicated to one kind of passengers (ie.
a ship with 1 T of cargo space per passenger and 1 steward per 8 passengers
for High Passengers, another ship with negligible cargo space and 1 steward
per 50 passengers for Mid Passengers, a ship with small staterooms for
what I call "Economy" Passengers, a ship with Low Berths and 1 medic per 20
berths for Low Passengers, and a ship with bunks only for what I call
"Steerage" Passengers) and used them to calculate reasonable ticket prices
(I posted them not so long ago). But for a true "Gigantic Class Passenger
Liner" I\'d use a combination of berths.

>If it were not mid passengers then you would need to find 29,000 passengers
>paying the usual rate 10,000 and still be better off than 5018cr per ticket.

The point is that unless you have some way of keeping off unwelcome
competition (like a cartel or government interference), jump-1 High
Passages would not _stay_ at Cr10,000. If it\'s possible to provide
the same service at a lower cost and still make a living, sooner or
later someone will provide that service. Any measures to prevent such
competition from operating would be part of a specific political
setup and should therefor be visible to the referee, so that he can
use the rules even if he changes the political setup for his own
campaign.

The old rule applies to Free Traders coming into starport and trying to
scrounge up a few passengers, not to regularily scheduled passengers
liners.

Sethkimmel@aol.com writes:

>strange.

So have I, but I came up with an explanation for the imperium. IMTU
High/Middle/Low passages don\'t exist outside the Imperium and the system
is strained in the Classic Era:

- ----
HIGH, MID, AND LOW PASSAGE
High, Mid, and Low passages are not tickets. They are travel vouchers issued
by various Imperial institutions and a number of licenced private institutions
(mostly megacorporations). By Imperial law any High Passage voucher must be
accepted by any ship licenced to carry passengers as full payment for a High 
Passage ticket, regardless of the length of the jump. Likewise the Mid and
Low Passage must be accepted as payment for Mid and Low Passage tickets. The 
ship captain can then exchange the voucher for the price of the ticket at any 
Class A or B starport. For starships with a flexible attitude to ticket 
prices (ie. tramp ships) the law imposes a maximum reimbursement of 
Crimp10,000 for a High Passage, Crimp8,000 for a Mid Passage, and Crimp2000 
for a Low Passage, unless they can document expenses that warrants a higher
price.

Often a passenger who is about to use a ticket to take a jump-1 or jump-2
trip will try to sell his High or Mid Passage to someone who plans to take a
jump-3 trip. Such trades are technically illegal, but the Imperium usually
ignore it. The going rate is around Crimp9,000 for a High Passage and 
Crimp7,200 for a Mid Passage.
- ----

You might as well see another idea of mine while I\'m at it:

- ----
HOT PASSAGE
Hot Passage is slang for a type of passage that unscrupulous starship
captains sometimes offer. It consists of two passengers sharing the same
berth turn and turn about ("hot bunking"). This is illegal because it means
exceeding the ship\'s life support rating and the ship\'s number of emergency 
low berths. The way it usually works, a passenger whose trip is paid for by 
his employers will pay in full and get a reciept for the full amount. The 
captain then sells the spot to another traveller for 50-60% of the usual 
cost. He pays half the amount to the first passenger and shares the rest with 
the purser.
- ----

I haven\'t done the calculations for Fast Passage (travelling while under the
influence of Fast Drug), but I will when I get around to it.

Bolie Williams IV writes:

>All of this talk of prices of passage ignores one fundamental issue.

Exactly. I ignore it because it is impossible to give any meaningful
rules for it.

>The price of anything is independant of the cost.

Not independent. _Someone_ has to pay the cost. Violating that law is
no more possible than violating a physical law (in fact, in a way you
can say that it is a manifestation of the laws of thermodynamics ;-).

   Then there was the case, supposedly true, of the soldier that had one of
the testicles shot off during a battle during the American Civil War.  The
round continued on and struck a young woman, who was part of a group of
civilians who were observing the fight, in the lower abdomen.

   That\'s right--she got pregnant, and nine months later gave birth.  It is
said the woman and the soldier were later married.

   Gives a whole new meaning to artifical insemination, eh?

I wonder how creationists \'justify\' it.  No, forget I asked that.  Might

Thanks, this was the kind of thing I was looking for.

This makes sense.  I have to admit I\'d kind of imagined supersaturated air.

Or how about outside the atmosphere altogether.  But you go on to neatly
demolish these...

Thanks again, this is the kind of thing I was assuming TML would know
about!


But I guess no water canopy...

Any chance we can create a pseudo-science that would manage it?  We can do
it for jump drives...

Thanks for the input everyone, however.

All right you guys.  Here it is.  My first real attempt at getting the TML
to critique some of my work.  Just remember these factsIm over forty,
overweight and balding and I still love the heck out of playing Traveller.
So you just better be nice.  Constructive criticism is always appreciated.
Flames will be looked at and then ignored.  Anyway,  here goes.

NOTE:  Some of this information may be already published in a post 1983

seen comments that the SDB Matrix may be outdated.  Please correct as
appropriate and supply me with corrections. If the SDB Matrix is to be
considered incorrect, the remainder of the information can be used as is.

Fifth Frontier War Starship Production System
(5FW-SPS)



The Flow

1.  Determine the number of system Defense Boat Squadrons
2.  Determine the number of Capital Starship Squadrons
3.  Determine Base Combat Factors and Modify
4.  Determine Jump Drive Number and Modify
5.  Determine Streamlining and Modify
6.  Determine Troop Capacity
7.  5 FW Counter Format 



1.0  System Defense Boat Squadron Production

Before a world can develop capital ships, it must develop and build its 
planetary defense force (PDF) or its system defense boat  (SDB) squadrons.
The SDB or SB squadron becomes the backbone of the PDF.  The number of
squadrons available at any given time are determined by the Tech Level and
the Population of the home world with some modification based upon its Trade
Rating and other information.  The numbers of squadrons is then used to
determine the number of capital ship squadrons that may be built by the home
world.  A squadron of SDBs is usually ten to twenty boats.  A capital ship
squadron is between four and ten ships.

NOTE:  Imperial Interdicted Planets (Red Zones) may have SDB Squadrons in
place due to Imperial Policy.

There will always be a minimum of one SDB squadron for worlds with TL 7+ and
Pop 7+,  TL A+ and Pop 5+, and TL D+ and Pop 2+, population being the
determining factor.  SDB Squadrons may only be built at A, B or C Starports.
This does not preclude a lesser starport from having SDB squadrons based
upon the ability to transport SDBs via Jump Shuttles and  SDB Riders.



2.0  Capital Starship Squadron Production

Once the number of SDB Squadrons are determined, the process for building
capital ship squadrons begins.  The total number of SDB squadrons determines
the total number of ship squadrons.  Starships can only be produced at A or
B starports.  Cruiser-rons will always be the first type of squadron built,
followed by battle-rons.  The building of a battle-ron does not take into
account that the squadron could be a battle rider squadron.  Each capital
ship squadron has a production value associated with it.  These values may
be used to exchange for other squadron types.  Production of starship
squadrons starts at TL 9.  Monitors may be built at TL 7 or better, using
the numbers based upon the TL 9 Column.

REMEMBER:  The first squadron built will always be a cruiser-ron.

Squadron Type		Production Value	Notes

Cruiser-ron  (CR)	1

Battle-ron  (BR)	1

Assault-ron  (AR)	2

Tanker-ron  (TR)*	3

Monitor-ron  (PR)*	2/3

Scout-ron  (SR)*	1/2			Scout base reqd

Mercenary-ron  (MR)*	1/2


*While monitors are considered planetary defense ships,  they are considered
capital ships due to their size and thus are considered part of the
production schedule.  As described in CT Books 2 and 5,  CT Supplements 7
and 9, and The Traveller Book, starship production takes between 36 and 60
months, modified by similar class production.  While this is beyond the
purview of the game "Fifth Frontier War,"  this system can be used to
simulate the spending of credits for starship production and the development
of current and new starship classes over a period of years of campaigning.*

3.0  Determine Combat Factors



3.1.  Defense Factor  (DF)

The Defense Factor is used to start building the squadron.  This is
determined by the world population code minus two plus any listed modifiers.
This is the basic factor and according to a 1983 letter from Marc Miller,
represents the number of capital ships available to the squadron.  Comments
on this later.

DF  =  Pop Code  -  2  +  Modifiers

DFs may be used to create attack factors and or bombardment factors.

By Substitution    2 DF   <  --  >   1 AF

		   2 DF   <  --  >   1 BF



3.2  Attack Factor  (AF)

The next combat factor developed is the Attack Factor (AF).  Fractional
remainders will be dropped.  The AF for battle-rons and monitor-rons is 2/3
the DF plus trade modifiers.  The AF for cruiser-rons is ½ the DF plus trade
modifiers.  All fractional remainders are dropped.

BR and PRs:	AF  =  2/3DF  +  Trade Modifiers

CRs:    	AF  =  1\\2DF  +  Trade Modifiers

Capitol         +1
Naval Base      +1

AFs may be used to create bombardment factors and/or defense factors.

By substitution:    1 AF  <  --  >  1 BF

		    1 AF  <  --  >  2 DFs

*Comments:  I have always regarded the AF as the number of auxiliary and
escort squadrons associated with the capital ship squadron.  These starships
would be ships of 5000 dT or less.  The number represents a number of
squadrons to a factor of ten.  Thus  an AF of 2 would represent 100
squadrons or between 400 and 1000 additional starships involved with the
squadron.  I realize that this is a huge range but would say four fleet
cruisers operate entirely by themselves?  I think not.  I see destroyers,
escorts, fast couriers, jump cutters, maintenance ships, etc, etc. involved
with a capital ship squadron.*



3.3  Bombardment Factor  (BF)

The bombardment factor is the last combat factor to be developed.  A
battle-ron, mercenary-ron, monitor-ron and scout-ron BF is 1\\2 the DF plus
trade modifiers.  A cruiser-ron BF is 1/3 the DF plus trade modifiers.  All
fractional remainders are dropped.

BR, MR, PR and SRs:	BF  =  1\\2DF   +  Trade Modifiers

CRs:			BF  =  1\\3DF  +  Trade Modifiers

Modifiers*

AS           +1
Capitol      +1
Navy Base    +1
Scout Base   +1 
Depot        +4

BFs may be used to create attack factors and/or defense factors.

By substitution:    1 BF  <  --  >  1 AF

		    1 BF  <  --  >  2 DFs

*Comments:  I have always seen the bombardment factor to represent those
starships and non-starships that are capable of attacking the surface of a
planet.  For the most part, I view these as the ubiquitous "fighters" of the
squadron or fleet.  (I dont want to restart the Fighter Vs Capital
Ship/Battleship/BattleRider, etc. thread.)  Fighters and other assault craft
would have to be streamlined/airframe type craft to support the landing of
troops on the surface of a planet.  If I recall the tenant of strategy I
learned while in the service, it takes the infantry to hold territory where
fire power takes it from the enemy.  Nuff said.  Hats off to the infantry.
You guys have and had the toughest job of all services.  You had an
opportunity to take and keep, as well as bleed and weep.*


Please note:   Through this whole process, the Scout squadrons do not get an
attack factor, while the Assault and the Tanker squadrons do not get an
attack or a bombardment factor.  Time to consider fleet make-up when playing
5FW.



4.0  Jump Drive Installation

Jump drives are installed based upon the maximum TL of the home world.  The
TL also determines what Jump Drive number that each squadron may "start out" at.

TL             Max Jump Drive	Starting Point

9		J1		J1
A		J1		J1
B		J2		J1
C		J3		J1
D		J4		J2   AR,TR    	    J1 All others
E		J5		J2   AR,CR,TR	    J1 All others
F		J6		J3   AR,CR,MR,SR,TR J1 BR
G*		*		*J4  AR,TR          J3 CR, etc  J2  BR
H*		*		*J4  AR,CR,TR       J3 MR,SR    J2  BR

All Mercenary and Scout-rons start at J2  and are maximized at TL 9 or
greater.  *At TL C or greater they start at J2 and may attain the listed
maximum Jump number.  At TL F or greater, follow the listed instructions.*

As an explanation,  at TL D(13), starships have a maximum jump drive
capability of J4.  The AR and TR squadrons will be initially planned with a
J2 capability while all others start out with J1.

The jump number of a particular squadron is increased up to its maximum by
substitution, using the following formulas:

By Substitution:	2 AF   < -- >  1 jump #

			2 BF   < -- >  1 jump #

			4 DF  < -- >   1 jump #

Monitor squadrons do not have jump capability.  Maneuver drives are not
considered in this format.



5.0  Streamlining

5FW Starships are considered streamlined, partially streamlined or
non-streamlined.  Streamlining has a value and a multiplier based upon the
squadron type which is then used to reduce the defense factor of the
squadron.  Streamlining has its costs.

Streamline Value  x  Squadron Value  =  DF reduction

Streamline	Squadron
Value		Value

non      0  	BR	2
part     1	TR	2
stream   2	AR	1
		CR	1
		PR*	2\\3
		SR	1\\2
		MR*	1\\2



6.0  Troop Capacity  (Battalions Carried)

Type	Full Strength	Half Strength

AR	6c		3c
BR	20		10
CR	DF		1\\2DF
MR*	1\\2DF		1\\4DF

All other ship squadrons are not capable of carrying troops.



7.0  Determining Squadron Counter Formats

The standard 5FW  counter format for a squadron shows the squadron type and
jump number (TJ) in the upper left corner, its refueling code (RF) in the
upper right corner, the ship outline in the center, and the combat values
along the bottom of the counter.  The combat values are listed as Attack
Factor (AF), Bombardment Factor (BF) and Defense Factor (DF).  The reverse
of the counter has the half strength values.

Like this:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
|  TJ                       RF |
|                              |
|           $ $ $              |
|                              |
|                              |
|        AF - BF - DF          |

Aye, these early traders ranged far and wide - but I was making the comparison between interstellar travel and the crossing of the Atlantic (which I, being incredibly Euro-America Centric, didn\'t spell out). The Phoenicians and the Indian Ocean traders were almost entirely coastal traders, able to put in to shore on a daily basis if necessary. Not to say their voyages weren\'t remarkable - the traders who would take a five year voyage as a matter of course, with a wife and family at each end of the trip. 

Relate my previous post to a culture with a land-based point of view, such as the Europeans, and the comparison is more accurate - seafaring cultures like the Polynesians and Norse Explorers would be far different (perhaps even serving as analog-examples for how non-human aliens or minor human alien races would think of space travel).

Note how the English, Russians, French, etc. once saw the Norsemen - frightening creatures that could come out of the unknown depths of the sea to ravage your home and then vanish over the unreachable horizon. A very different mind-set than that held by Columbus, Magellan or the other famous explorers from later on.

   That\'s right--she got pregnant, and nine months later gave birth.  It is
said the woman and the soldier were later married.

I think it\'s more likely the "civilians observing the fight" were camp followers (i.e. prostitutes & mistresses) and the lady in question got pregnant the old-fashioned way.

"Doctor, I just _couldn\'t_ be pregnant. I\'m a decent woman, I\'d _never_ do such a thing."
Doctor: "Right, right...OK, we\'ll say the bullet did it..."

Union General Hooker, while in charge of New Orleans, always had some mistresses around his office. When a visitor would ask, "Who are they?", the aides would respond "They\'re Hooker\'s". And so the slang term was born....

combat system, I have been trying to shoehorn it into
Traveller combat.  Here\'s what I have so far:

1) The target: I photocopied the picture of the battle-
   dressed marine in MT\'s _Imperial Encyclopedia_ (or
   is that _Ref\'s Companion_?), and enlarged it.

2) The sight: I created a 12-ring target pattern in an
   8"x8" area, with a 0.5"-diameter bullseye in the center.
   The rings I subdivided into 12 sections.  The outer
   ring numbers the sections, clockwise from 12 o\'clock:

	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c

   The next ring is numbered, clockwise from 12 o\'clock:

	2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c 1

   Next from 12: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c 1 2

   Et cetera, until the innermost ring is labelled:

	c 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b

   The bullseye is not sectioned.

3) Aim.  Center the bullseye over the spot aimed for.

4) Roll to hit as usual.  If the roll is a miss, then
   the amount by which the shot missed is the ring
   position out from the center, while the roll itself
   is the section of the ring which the shot went through.
   A miss may still hit.

   It seems to make it easier to hit people.  Perhaps there
   needs to be a -DM to the roll.

5) Damage.  I haven\'t thought a lot about it, but how about

	Arms, Legs	  : STR
	Hands, Feet, Head : DEX
	Middle		  : END
	Weapon		  : weapon hit, possibly damaged.

Opinions?

LAPD officer was struggling with a suspect who was armed with a .22 pistol.
 The gun went off, hitting the officer in the foot.  Withing ten minutes he
was dead from shock.

At Khe Sanh in 1968, a NVA sapper was hit with atleast three rounds from a
.50cal macine gun at close range.  The man stood up, and walked away.

One of my police friends told me about a SFPD officer who was accused of
shooting a suspect in the back.  After an investigation, it turned out that
the officer\'s shot had entered the subject\'s open mouth and penetrated the
back of his neck cleanly.

Things like this make me wonder why I\'m trying to design a combat system.

MT campaigns fell short in creating appropriate sectors for earlier
Milieux. Especially the TL and Starport values created annoyed me. So
now I propose for your approval, the........

Milieu World Generation Modification Table, V. 0.1

Milieu		Starport 	Naval Base 	Scout Base	  Tech
		Modifyer	 Modifyer    	 Modifyer	DM/Cutoff

Interstellar Wars					        -2 /  C
Rule of Man							-2 /  D
Long Night	   +2 		    -2		    -2		-3 /  D
Milieu 0	   +1 		    -1		    -1		-1 /  D
				
				
				
				
Starport DM modifies rolled result, so during the Long Night a 2 becomes
a 4.
	(Extensive Starports become a rarity in the Long Night, as interstellar
trade ceases)

The Tech DM modifies the result of the TL Calculation: During the
Interstellar Wars, TL B becomes a TL 9

Cutoff means the highest possible general TL of the Era. During the
Interstellar Wars, the Terrans just reached TL C, while the Vilani still
were at TL B. Higher TL Worlds are reduced to that value during
creation.

Any suggestions, comments

   Given the nature of the culture here and its overall instability (not to

   Nope TL 21--none of the rule books allow us to design anything of a
higher technology.

   My take on stats therefore:

   A470270-K   B   Lo Po De    R614  Tr  M2III

   Starport (A) - starships constructed on a regular basis using non-relic
components.

   Size (4) - In case no one else has figured it out, the Traveller is not
as big as most other major RPGs these days.

   Atmosphere (7) - The atmosphere is standard for fan mailing lists.  Taint
is the result of non-topic conversations, and occasional flame wars.

   Hydrosphere (0) - Ever tried to get a drink of water around here?

   Population (2) - Hundreds of subscribers.

   Government (7) - Various factions struggling for the dominace of their
version of the game.

   Law Level (0) - This is a unmoderated list.

   Tech Level (K) - Described above.

   Trade Class (Lo Po De) - Described elsewhere, save for the fact that many
of us are broke from buying sourcebooks.

   Traveller\'s Aid Society Designation (R) - Described above.

   Pop Mod (5) - I believe someone said the list had between 500 and 600
members.

   Planetoid Belts (1) - The result of shattered hopes and dashed dreams.

   Gas Giants (4) - The result of bloated egos and grandiose schemes.  No, I
will not list their names!

   Allegiance Code (Tr) - We owe our allegiance to Traveller.

   Stellar Data (M2III) - The future is not as bright as it once was....

Harold

Fabulous!  Are your images in .jpg or some other digital format?

I would want some other somatotypes to play with too; a Kate moss figure, a
Danny Devito figure, an \'average\' human male sans armor, etc.

Rather than giving a negative DM, I would say increase difficulty one level
and playtest it that way.

How are you going to handle auto-fire (why do my campaigns seem to always
involve a lot of autofire?) and shotguns? (Those too).  How about armor?
Withthis system a torso/abdomen flak jacket seems to potentially be
properly applicable; if the hit is where there is armor, apply the armor;
otherwise don\'t.

Get those images/targets digitized!  Or send em to me and I\'ll scan em in!

Price is correlated with cost, as if the difference between the cost to
provide a service and the price charged for the service reaches the point
where someone else can enter the market, provide the services, and undercut
the present players, then it tends to happen.  The primary bars to this
happening are large startup costs or regulations.  They cannot be
independent, as any sane financier will ask about the potential return on
the investment in question.

Your arguments do hit some of the major issues which show why a fixed price
ticket to all destinations almost certainly bespeaks government regulation,
or price fixing.  In my universe, prices on major liners are fixed by law,
and small operators can charge what the market will bear.  Once a small
operator gets large enough to matter, they are brought into the family.

For reference, basing the GDT = 100 ft^3 = 2.83 m^3, then the Nimitz,

It\'s not a dumb question, but it\'s a complicated one. The short answer
is that gravity, plus various random differences in the mass of galaxies
(or, more precisely, local fluctuations in the density of the post-big-bang
gas that condensed to form the galaxies) adds small random velocities to
individual galaxies on top of the overall motion from the big bang. (For 
example, you can use your legs to add a small random motion towards your
desk, in spite of the overall motion.) [1] 

The long answer adds in the fact that there isn\'t a common center, and 
the big bang shouldn\'t be visualized as an explosion in Euclidean space out from
a common point. Take a look at

  A stray thought...

  One of a kind ships should have more expensive Maintenance costs - after
all, the parts need to be manufactured special for that particular ship.
Granted, the ship could have been built on off the shelf components, but
then again, how the ship is put together would be different wouldn\'t it?
Spare parts would have to be shipped in since I doubt that many starports
will bother to stock parts of a ship that may or may not pull into port
there...

  On that topic, would it not be better to just assign a discount on
maintenance for ships that fill a certain class requirement?   Just stray
thoughts...

A completely apocryphal legend, but a good one none-the-less.  Apparently some
fact checking was done on the story a while back, and it turned out to be
nothing more then a legend...

It is still taught as truth in some colleges however.

An excellent retelling is in the trade paperback: "The Big Book of Urban
Legends", which retells some 200 or so legends, some urban and some not so
urban, in one page comic strip form.  The pictures that go with this
particular story are hysterical.

I believe it\'s your imagination. I looked through LBB#7 and MT Player\'s

This seems to be the case.  The problem is that I have seen one
reference
(a dictionary) and heard a direct quote from another about the 100 ft^3 
per GRT conversion.  The dictionary seemed to indicate that it was, in
fact
a definition.  The other indicated that it was an approximation.  Go
figure.

It so happens that I KNOW the exact interior volume of one class of US
ship and one class of French ship from an issue of Naval Engineer\'s
Journal.


The LSD 41 Class (US) displaces 11367 metric tonnes light loaded and 
has an interior volume of 72,180 m^3.  This equates to a Traveller
displacement of 5347 Dt.  The density is 6.35 m^3/tonne.

Full loaded it displaces 16,151 metric tonnes for a density of 4.47
m^3/tonne.


The French Le Foudre displaces 8230 metric tonnes light loaded with an
interior volume of 56,020 m^3.  This equates to Traveller displacement
of 4150 Dt. The density is 6.81 m^3/tonne.

Full loaded it displaces 12,013 metric tonnes for a density of 4.66
m^3/tonne.

Obviously, the volume to mass ratio (and therefore the gross register
tonnage to mass ratio) varies with hullform and interior construction.

For example, I did a VERY CRUDE experiment to measure interior hull
volume
of the IOWA class BB\'s with a result of approximately 4770 Dt.  Not as
much
as I expected, but then again, the BB\'s displaced so much (46,000 -
62,000
tons) because they had so much solid steel on them.  Guns, armor, etc.

Carriers and Amphibs are essentially specialized cargo ships and are
therefore comprised of much larger open spaces.  Thererefore their
density is smaller.

BTW, I did my BB displacement experiment using a Revell model which
was flat bottomed.  I suspect that the model was laregly inaccurate.
Anybody possessing further info on this matter, please let me know!

I don\'t think the starport capacity is over-discussed.  Admittedly, 
I\'ve only been on the TML for 12 months, but I only recall two starport 
threads.

One was about number of berths.

The other is the current one about trading levels.

Maybe when we get the TML CD we can use the yet-to-be-designed indexing 
tool to search for all those old discussion threads.

One of my favourite topics again!

For a high-trade universe I recommend the highest of:
(a) TL^2 metric tonnes per person per year
(b) Gov =1..9: 2^TL * POP digit tonnes per year

For a starport-only driven trade system I recommend:
A = 14 million m3 per week (1 M ton)
B = 1.4 million m3 per week (100 k ton)
C = 0.14 million m3 per week (10 k ton)
D = 14 thousand m3 per week (1 k ton)
E = 1.4 thousand m3 per week (100 ton)

For a more complex system:
hope that Andy lily includes trade levels in his oft-rumoured "101 
starports" book from CORE.

Justification for high trade universe
=====================================
A hi pop world that is importing multi-mega tonnes of raw materials 
must be getting them from a (very busy) world nearby, so there can be 
orders of magnitude extra for lo pop mining worlds - this is reflected 
in the TL of that world (high tech mining gear or rich populace who can 
buy what they want).

Interstellar trade will be driven by many things, but we can draw 
comparisons with current world trade and historical trade (which was 
often higher), but the two main flows of trade will probably be:

(1) trade between two worlds of similar TL and pop 7+ each

(2) Imports of raw materials (possibly including food) to Pop 7+ , TL 
4+ worlds.  Low tech (TL 0 to 2 and probably 3) do not have the 
industrial infrastructure to generate imports, but may get them as 
payemnts for the raw materials removed from their world by megacorp 
ships.

If pop 7+ worlds are near each other, then there is no real problem 
with them keeping their mutual starports busy, but this does not allow 
us to cope with hi pop worlds close to low pop mining worlds (including 
asteroid belts).

Other notes
===========
It would be possible to come up with a mix of pop and starport rules 
for determining trade volume.  I play, does it really matter?  Most of 
the trade will be carried by the big boys in their 5,000 - 300,000 T 
ships.  The free traders fill in "the gaps", taking odd assortments of 
freight and speculative cargo that are available for any number of odd 
reasons. There would be a boring "sameness" for the main trade goods, 
but a huge diversity for the odds and ends left to the free traders.

Small worlds, or ones with poor starports, rely on the free traders for 
all freight and cargo to and from the world ... somewhere with only 100 
T total exports per week will not expect (or even support) 10 free 
traders each week!  As I mentioned in my posting on starport berths, 
IMTU these low-traffic systems are good adventure fodder:

"Nope, \'fraid we ain\'t got none cargo this week.  You might want to 
visit Joe Windlake\'s place, as I hear he is harvesting real soon.

"No, you don\'t need a special bit of paper to fly your space wagon 
there ... just be careful where you land.  I reckon you\'d be better 
taking a ride, t\'aint mor\'n five days by horse and I\'m sure fancy chaps 
like you will have one of them floating contraptions to do it in no 
time.  Joe\'ll be happy to set aside a place to set down once he knows 
you\'re coming.

Well, require players to make an aimed action, i.e., no movement.  They
take the risk of becoming stationary, thus easier for opponents to hit.

I think Dex should apply to all of arm (at least the lower arm - elbow
down) and hand (with extra damage if a right handed person\'s hand is
hit), since Dex is primarily used for firing weapons, etc.  Legs/Upper
Arm - Shoulder/Upper Torso/Back should effect STR.  Center Torso/Abdomen
as well as damage when penetrates armor to END (as blows in these areas

as opposed to busting your hand up, etc.

This is the part that I\'m very unsure of, and one of the reasons that I
asked the original question. Concidering the refining time vs the scooping
time as proposed in this technique is just too great, 6, 8 12 hours to
refine and purify the fuel means, filling the tanks, waiting that long then
refilling the tanks, etc. Also, unless you have 2 or more tanks, one for the
unrefined fuel "in front" of the refining equipment, and one after, you will
probably have to run the fuel you refined previously through again.

I pictured a less violent form of refueling, dependant on CG. Basically the
ship enters atmoshere and trolls for fuel at a rate equal to it\'s refining
capacity. On reflection this is NOT supported by FFS2 (not sure about FFS1),
since only hypersonic streamlined hulls can skim for fuel. However, with CG
and thrusters this process makes more sense to me. Think of the veiw (which
I was when I pictured a tourist cruise) something like the Hindenburg gently
gliding through the upper atmoshere of the Gas Giant, (or like a whale
feeding if you have no poetry in your soul). Anyway I digress, and as i said
the rules do not support this anyway, and it was such a good gimick to set
up a "Titanic" scenario! Oh, well, back to the drawing board!

Like I could actual break through their ennui and apathy.  ;-)In fact I have a copy
of one branch of my family tree that starts in 1700:  Bartholomew Dupuy and his
wife Susanna Lavillan fled France because of Louis XIV.  So I\'m part, very small
part, French.

BTW, any one ever develop any interstellar geneological agencies?

with a max height of	209\'8" keel to mast top (63.9 m)

In terms of fuel, they carried 2.5 million gallons (9.5 million liters)
of fuel poil, 30,000 gallons (114,000 l) of aviation fuel, and 
239,000 gallons (905,000 l) of water.  I also have armor data and

    'body' => 'Dress Me Up

Wherever there are children, there will be toys.  The Third Imperium is no
different.  On all of the thousands of worlds that humaniti has settled on,
dress up dolls have always been popular items.  The "Dress Me Up" system from
Delgado is a high-tech holographic version popular in mainstream Imperial
culture.  The "Dress Me Up" system is not the only version of the toy in
Imperial space, but it is by far the most popular.

Delgado\'s "Dress Me Up" system is a return to the basics of toymaking.  It is
basically the same as such toys as Barbie and Kisyakae dolls on Terra, the
Admii doll on Vland, as well as countless others that have existed throughout
the hundreds of thousands of years of human history.  You have a doll, and you
can dress up that doll in any combination of a large variety of different
outfits.  In this case, however, the doll and the outfits are holographic and
are stored on data cartridges that are read by a specialized computerized
unit.  The system has a long history, and variations on the same unit have
been in use since 824.  Modern units are compatible with older data
cartridges, which has created a thriving collector\'s market.

The actual specifications are as follows:  The system is a disk with sloping
sides.  The diameter is 34.5 cm at the base, and 32 cm at the top.  It stands
12.5 cm high.  The unit masses .4 kg.  The edges are rounded and there are no
sharp protrusions.  A viewscreen is set on the side of the unit, and it is
touch sensitive, eliminating the need for buttons.  The screen covers just a
little under half of the side.  The hardware that projects the holographic
images is set in the top underneath clear, scratch-resistant plastic.  There
are sockets for data cartridges built into the back of the unit, two large
ones for doll data cartridges, and six smaller ones for clothing data
cartridges.  Next to these sockets are two jacks, one for a power cord, and
one to hook the unit to a computer system so clothing combinations can be
saved and viewed on the computer at a later date.  Both jacks are Imperial
standard and the connecting cords are readily available on any world with an
Imperial presence.  The unit is extremely durable, and on the off chance that
any part should break, the components inside are extremely user friendly.  A
fixed rechargeable battery allows the unit to be operated for up to thirty
hours from a full charge.  There is no power switch on the unit, the unit is
switched on when a doll cartridge is inserted, and switched off when the
cartridge is removed.  If the unit is left alone for ten minutes, it will shut
off automatically, and can be turned on again by re-inserting a doll data
cartridge.  Two dolls can be displayed at any given time, and the fully re-
configurable viewscreen allows the dolls position and the clothes to be
changed.

The data cartridges are also very durable.  They are rectangular with rounded
edges, and are set within a sheath that retracts when inserted.  The doll data
cartridges are 4.5 cm wide, 6 cm long, and 1.8 cm high.  The clothing data
cartridges are smaller, 2.5 cm wide, 4 cm long, and 1 high.  The labels on the
cartridges will vary in size depending on local tastes, but older cartridges
tend to have a smaller space covered with label.  Modern cartridges are often
completely covered with a brightly colored label, pinks, blues and yellows are
popular colors.

The doll information on the cartridges varies from location to location within
the Imperium.  Third party companies purchase licenses to produce dolls, so
the variety is almost endless.  Doll clothing cartridges are extremely common,
and can be used with most dolls, since scaling algorithms in the unit \'tailor\'
the outfit to fit the current doll.  However, some clothing data is
\'protected\' and will only work with certain dolls.  The Imperial family have
always been hot sellers, "Dress Me Up: Ciencia Iphegenia" recently broke the
previous sales records set by the "Dress Me Up: Liisha Memorial" doll set
licensed by the late Vilani fashion model turned actress and singer\'s estate.

Usually, the dolls are not anatomically correct.  In some locations, however,
making the dolls anatomically incorrect is viewed unfavorably, or even as an
insult.  As a result, the anatomically correct data is stored on the
cartridges and is decoded by a special chip that comes in the units sold in
those areas.  Pirated decoding chips have been made, and are hot sellers in
all areas of the Imperium.  Apparently, there are enough people interested in
undressing the dolls and posing them in lewd positions to make to make the
trade in these chips profitable.

As has been said previously, the durability of the cartridges, and the long
history that the system has had, have created a thriving collectors market in
the Imperium.  Older cartridges can sell at conventions and auctions for
hundreds of thousands of credits.  Currently, the system is at a peak in
popularity, so such conventions are common in all the corners of the Imperium.

Delgado keeps a tight leash on this product, as it is a constant source of
income, and the megacorporation will vigorously pursue all legal means to keep
unlicensed products off of the shelves.  However, for reasons known only to
Delgado, they do not seem to pursue the market in the pirated chips, although
they denounce them publicly in their own "Dress Me Up" magazine, and
statements to the press.  More cynical types note that Delgado obviously knows
that the pirated chips open up a new market for the system, and units sold are
still units sold, allowing them to keep a leg up on the competition.

The unit has found its way into a number of other niches as well.  They are
used in classes at universities and colleges to display outfits and uniforms
of bygone eras.  Specialized units are also used at art schools for fashion
design.  These units have an additional connector to allow input from an
Imperial standard computer so outfits can be made and tailored to fit specific
"dolls".  Delgado keeps a close eye on these units, making sure that ulicensed
outfit cartridges aren\'t produced.  "Dress Me Up" units are highly sought
after on worlds with low levels of technology, as they\'re educational use is
almost invaluable.  Delgado is currently market testing a new spin on the toy
called "Dress Me Up: Snapshot".  Consumers can go into a specially licensed
boutique or toy store and have themselves "encoded" into the "Dress Me Up"
standard.  Then this encoded image can be written onto a data cartridge and
used as any other doll would be.  In some places where "Dress Me Up: Snapshot"
has been tested, the cartridge is \'time-limited\' and must be renewed every
month.  Delgado hasn\'t completed its full analysis yet, but it is expected
that some form of "Dress Me Up: Snapshot" will be available in the Imperium
within two to ten years.

Current Delgado "Dress Me Up" systems are TL13, although the earliest units
would be considered TL11.  These units can be purchased at any world with an
Imperial presence, regardless of the planetary tech level.  The units are
extremely technician friendly, and can be repaired or modified at any world
with a tech level of 8+ by any technician with access to the proper repair
parts.  Of course, having the unit repaired by a non-licensed technician is
not advised, as the Delgado warranty will be null and void.  The cartridges
are available in all corners of the Imperium, and, much like the systems, can
be bought at any world with an Imperial presence regardless of the level of
technology that can be produced on the planet.  The pirated decoding chips can
be purchased on the black market throughout the imperium, and can be
manufactured at any world with a tech level of 10+.

starship that I know of, the BI-15 from FSotSI.

I divided the drawing into 6 geometrical solids and analyzed the
component volumes to get the total.  I also assumed that the ship
as depicted was at 45 degrees to the line of view on page 19
of FSotSI.

Here\'s what I arrived at:

	L = 20n = 681.4 m ~ 682 m length
	B = 8.5n= 289.6 m ~ 290 m beam
	D = 1n  = 34.07 m ~ 34  m draught

It displaces 700,000 Td or 9,450,000 m^3 and mounts a Type "T"
spinal meson gun (which we can determine from the Tigress design
must be less than 235 m in length, since one fits inside a Tigress
along a diameter axis.)

Tigresses, BTW, are PUNY.  (500,000 Td = 6,750,000 m^3)

This implies that the radius of the Tigress is 117.25 m =>
That the Tigress\' diameter is a measly, puny, insignificant
235 m).  Hardly the DEATH STAR, eh...

So, THAT\'s how BIG Traveller starships are!

Ah, yes, but what *kind* of tons?

There are 
 2,000 lb tons
 2,200 lb long tons
 1,000 kg metric tons
 100 cu ft Ship Registery tons
 14 cu m  Traveller Displacement tons

...and any number of other measures all called ton. Then there is the
problem of what the ton is measuring, is it mass, weight (not the same
thing), or displacement (displacement of what? water or hydrogen).

I worked out, one time, that you can get a close approximation between
earth ship Registery tons (most US and British ships seem to be rated
that way) and Traveller DTons on a 5 to 1 ratio.  If that\'s so, then a
46,000 ton Titanic would approximate a 9,200 DTon Traveller ship. 

However, with all the different *kinds* of tons, who can really tell for
sure.

There\'s a book by one Norman Freidman (sp?) on battleship design and
contruction that goes into some detail on hull volumes, etc (though not
superstructure volume). IIRC the Iowa\'s had very fine hulls, so your
estimate may not be off by that much. BTW there is an analysis in his book
that shows that the US Navy misrepresented the level of protection the
Iowa\'s had for many years.

You are correct. This is what it should read:

Free Trader Business
1 Engineering
2 Navigation
3 Steward
4 Legal
5 Pilot
6 Broker

Roll 5 Steward is replaced with Pilot.

This is what it stated in MT.

Dat\'s BIIIIIIIIG.  :)

Does anybody know the name of this class, BTW?  (Or other classes in
FSotSI?)  I know that the ED-15 is the Rapier, and a few others (BR-14) 
were named in Battle Rider, IIRC.  BI-15 might be the Sylea.  I know that
the CT supplement Fighting Ships gave names for some of them, but I don\'t
have that one.  If anyone has this info, can you please post a list (or a
URL)?  Thanks!

How much canonical information is there on Zhodani capital ship classes?

I concur, but sugqest that "FusionPlus" would probably be the marketing
name for the technology.  We would just note in TTA that it is
generically 
the first application of nascent Nuclear Damper technologies to the
problem 
of fusion, much like antimatter spiking or muon catalzation.

IMTU, although they appear at TL12, ND technologies (Hadronics) don\'t
reach maturity until TL13.  They then continue to develop normally from
this point on.  Note that this is wehn the Fusion Rx\'s jump from 2 to 3
MWe/m^3.

One methodology is to simply assume that the nuclear field manipulation
reduces the required containment energy.   This reduces the volume of
the containment apparatus.

Another method is to assume that the development of mesonic technology,
an 
application of the growing electroweak force engineering field 
(which leads to meson guns and meson screens at TL\'s 11-12) allows
more powerfulk containment field for a given volume, or more powerful 
ignition lasers for inertial schemes.

In any case, after TL 13, the actual fusion reaction used in Rx\'s
changes 
as it becomes possible to reduce the threshold energy for 
fusion considerably by weakening the proton-proton repulsion in
joining nuclei and to strengthen the strong nuclear force (with similar 
effect) both in range and amplitude.  I\'ve even figured out which
reactions
are likely candidates!

the back from the drawing. When you also consider the "pac-man"
mouth on it then the length for the spinal weapon gets pretty short.

This doesn\'t matter in CT since the meson gun is only 1% of the hull

No problem. My favourite character was a Merchant Prince. Started with a
small tramp trader, ended up as Imperial Governor. Which was ironic, as he
was opposed to annexation and was striving to establish a small federation
(in District 268).  The stress of balancing Imperial duties, managerial
responsibilities, and political subversion eventually gave him a heart
attack, which he survived but then his doctor (another player) made him
give up day-to-day management of the merchant company.

Those were the days. We would have killed for Pocket Empires. Can you
imagine calculating the economy of a world using the trade tables as a
basis?  Without a computer?  We had more time for games in those days

Good question! 

Yep.  The 5:1 ratio DOES work if you\'re equating gross register tonnage
to Traveller displacement.  It doesn\'t work if you\'re equating
displacement tons
(of water) to Trav Disp.  That\'s because Titanic displaced 46,000 tons
of water,
that is 46,000 cubic  meters while afloat.  But since mouch of her hull
volume
was above the waterline, she carried an even larger internal volume.

Displacement Tonnage (Water):

I believe these are effectively long tons, i.e. 2200 lbs.  The
Treaty which established the tonnage convention back earlier this
century 
(London, Washinton Naval Arms Treaties?) may have had
more specific language.  perhaps the standard even predates those.

I admit, I\'m not sure.

In any case 2200 lbs = 1000 kg (approximately) = 1 Metric Ton. So I
believe
the answer is "both."

Displacements are always weights of water displaced by the ship, so
this just tells us how much Titanic weighed.  Unfortunately, the
volume to weight ratio (the reciprocal of the overall density) does
not equate well between ships, and is highly dependent upon hullform
and ship employment.  Ocean liners are basicaly big air filled boxes
with minimal machinery and no heavy equipment.

Imperial Squadrons copies a lot of its material from Fifth Frontier War
and supplemental JTAS articles. One of the first things I\'ve noticed.

I too suspect that this is the Sylea class.  The old art gave Sylea as
100,000 tons.  But that falls into the cruiser class.  The design is
in some ways similar.

Anyway, compare this size with the size of a Star Wars vessel:

	Star Destroyer			1600 m
	Super Star Destroyer		7500 m (?)
	Super Duper Star Destroyer	17,500 m

or one of the vessels from the Honor Harrington series:

	Nike (?)			1600 m (?)

This supports my argument that Traveller ships need to be BIGGGERR.

I own a Roman sling pellet (recovered from a 1st century BC siege site, and
now, I hope, in storage from my move), and it is about an ounce in wt,
although more of an oblate shperoid, rather like an American football about 2
inches long and 3/4 in in the middle. The Romans had special forceps for
removing them from wounds, so they had to have been able to penetrate skin.
Even with armor, something like that could really mess you up.

No, this is a case of mistaken identity. The French do not believe that Jerry

Yup. I tend to get wierd looks when I answer pollsters questions honestly.
But then, they are set up for simple one-word answers to complex issues,
so what do you expect?

Q. Do you believe in God?

A. On good days. And if I\'m lucky on bad days too, but the really bad days
make it hard to believe in anything but random chance. I mean, could you
look one of your kids in the eye and tell her that God wanted her brother
to be murdered? How could an all-powerful God let that happen?

Q. Um. The next question is: Do you believe in heaven and hell?

A. In what sense? I\'ve paddled with dolphins, watched eagles soar in a
cobalt-blue sky, rested awhile with a 2000-year-old cedar, hugged a child
while we watched a butterfly dry its wings and fly, fed wild songbirds
perched on my fingers, sang with friends, talked with the wise.... I know
of My Lai, Dachau, East Timor, the Gaza Strip, Burma, Wounded Knee-
tragedies too numerous to mention, too painful to forget. I\'ve lived in
heaven; I\'ve read of hell.  The memory of one comfort the knowledge of the
other.

Uh I think they mean heaven and hell as places.

The Karen Range is a place. Dachau is a place.

Q. I\'ll put undecided. Do you believe in angels?

A. Doesn\'t everyone with children?

AnotherundecidedThankyouforyourtimegoodbye.


For what it\'s worth, I\'m warden of an Anglican church. Our last priest had
a Confucian heritage, our current one is a converted Jew, and I was raised
on stories of Raven and Coyote.  I find ritual comforting, church politics
frustrating, and consider human dignity a damn sight more important than
washing the alter linen or wearing a suit to church (which seems to put me
and the clergy at loggerheads with the parish \'elders\').


Traveller? I guess this is pretty off-topic. Just remember not to
stereotype every practicing member of a faith. Torquemande and St Francis
were both Catholics. Rolf ???(forget name) was a Nazi who saved thousands
of Chinese in Nanking.  There\'s a lot of variation.

IIRC, for a time (the 70s?) NATO stated they would use tac-nukes to 
respond to any Warsaw Pact invasion because of the perceived 
weaknesses of NATO\'s conventional forces.

DGP gave the Vilani this aspect in the Vilani&Vargr sourcebook:
long conventional wars are expensive - its much more efficient to 
nuke your enemy back into a proper appreciation of the order of 
things.  Of course, this is fine if you are in a position of strength 
as the 1st Imperium was; it get\'s awfully messy when your opponents 
can return the favour.

You can use this to set up some discord between the Solomani and 
Vilani (and any other) influences in the Imperium.

In CT 100ktons was pretty much a CA, true. The art in Library Data
makes it look a lot more like a Star Destroyer from Star Wars,
though.

I never really liked many of the ships in that book (FSotSI). The
cruisers and the BI-15--oh, and the EDs--were the only ones I liked.
The tenders were dumb as hell, too.

Try one ship. Vectors can change in time, and a single ship can have a
delta vee that changes in three dimensions. Try to plot a single ship

I rather like the Fusion+.  It has more commercial potential if you make the
\'+\' in striking contrast with the word fusion.

I\'m thinking of a very futuristic techno-inspired font (that is, mechanical,
slanted letters with larger tops than bases), bottom half of the letters dark
blue, top half light blue with a large, striking violet \'+\' at the end, half
covering the \'n\' in fusion...

Now all it needs is a catchy slogan...

"This ain\'t grandpa\'s power plant!" (no connection to _the_ grandpa)

"Just like fusion, only smaller."

"Lightweight, Low Maintenance, Hi-POWERED!"

Then I\'m imagining, in the lower right corner of the advertisement, a dark
blue "Z", its design suggesting a pyramid, and below it the blurb: 

"Zhunastu Industries: We make the things that work...  for you."

and below that contact information.

   Keep in mind the impact speed will be based the difference in 
orbital velocities between the planet and the rock (which could vary 
from 0 to 10s of km/s), plus the acceleration the planet adds to the 
rock on its way in (which could add several km/s).  In the case of 
Earth, drop a rock straight in in the direction of Sol, and it\'ll hit 
Earth at 30-40 km/s.  You do have to remove the rock\'s normal orbital 
velocity (on the order of 10 km/s at the asteroid belt, IICC).

The crew of the far trader \'Trebixim Nolo\' is back, and badder than ever in
the Tom Jetland vid that you just have to see to believe!  Gal Konriv, Liisha,
and Ugkfoung Akuedharrgh head the cast of this edge-of-your seat thriller from
the producers of "Tom Jetland: Killer Cargo"!

Jetland (Konriv) buys an illegal cargo of bexrin furs and tries to unload them
at a trading post on the other side of the Solomani border.  He gets more than
he bargained for as a high passenger on his ship turns out to be a member of
the underhanded Solomani authorities!  His ship is impounded, and he ends up
on a world in the grips of a brutal civil war.  While there he meets a
beautiful and mysterious freedom fighter (the acting debut of the Vilani
fashion model Liisha) who needs his help to save her world from the iron fist
of Solomani rule.  As he molds her ragtag guerillas into an unstoppable
fighting force, he finds love and lust with the mysterious rebel.  The action
reaches the boiling-point as Jetland leads commando raids against enemy
targets in order to smash the oppressors and liberate the freedom-loving
people of the planet...

The ending is so pulse-pounding and heart-stopping, we could never think of
ruining it for you here!  You have to watch for yourself and see why the Tom
Jetland series is your first choice for action and adventure!

Cast:

Gal Konriv as Tom Jetland
Ugkfoung Akuedharrgh as his fearless, wisecracking sidekick Lucky
Liisha as Clarissa Hart
Brice Manil as Engineer Kindahi
Ellyana Harman as Morgana \'Corkscrew\' McTavish
Girur Duliirumar as Comm Officer Karshugaa 
Sir Malcolm Kuahnir as Party Member Biloski
and introducing Stephon Malkinne as Jake

Review:

Okay, you saw the first Tom Jetland vid and you loved it.  I don\'t blame you,
it was fantastic, a classic among actionvids.  You saw the second one, and
when it was over, you felt a warm glow as Jetland saved the emperor from an
assassination plot.  If you were like me, by the time you got to the third the
formula was tired, the stereotypes were stale, and even the comic stylings of
vargr comedian Ugkfoung Akuedharrgh ceased to be funny.  Then, you watched
four, five, six, and by the time you got to seven, you wondered why you even
liked the first.  "Tom Jetland: High Passage" is basically a really terrible
vid, even by the standards of most fans of the genre.  If the characters were
stale by the third vid, they are positively rotten now.

Konriv (recently voted "Sexiest Human Male of the Year" by Eternity Magazine)
does what he does best: smiles, poses, and does acrobatic stunts while
peppering the bad guys with his patented double-pistol barrage.  Konriv
recently complained that he was sick of being typecast, and he wanted to move
on to more serious roles...  Sorry Gal, this ain\'t the way to go about it!
Ugkfoung Akuedharrgh returns as Jetland\'s furry and lovable sidekick Lucky,
but he seems bored and uninspired throughout the vid.  One of the fluffy plush
Lucky dolls that all the kids wanted for Holiday a few years back could have
done a better job.  Brice Manil reprises the role of the gruff, laconic
Engineer Kindahi, and Girur Duliirumar once again plays the tired stereotype
of the annoyingly by-the-numbers Vilani Comm Officer.  I shudder to think of
what each of these actors will do when this series runs its course!  Ellyana
Harman replaces Jake Hollister in the role of astrogator.  With the exception
of a new name and the fact that the character is female, it is the exact same
role that Hollister \'prefected\', the trash-talking and ultra-cool war veteran
with mirrored shades and a nihilistic air.  Give me a break.  Please!
Newcomer Stephon Malkinne is a complete nuisance as the sickeningly cute 9
year old guerilla Jake who vows revenge on the Solomani marines who killed his
parents.  Why they needed \'kid appeal\' for such a violent movie is beyond me. 

The action sequences are what you come to expect of this series, only with
better special effects and a much bigger scale.  After all, Jetland and his
crew are at war here!  The military hardware looks expensive and deadly.
Despite all of the bad points of this movie, the action does move on at a good
clip.  The battle sequences are really high-octane and faster-than-light.  The
script and dialogue, however, are completely atrocious.  I mean, so bad that
the movie is almost unwatchable.  The viscious anti-Solomani slant of this
movie is completely disgusting.  I really thought we moved past such caustic
stereotypes years ago.  Why the honorable Sir Malcolm Kuahnir would accept
such a role as the Party Leader is really beyond me.  He had been the idol of
my youth with such classic vid\'s as "Dresden\'s Decision" and "Lady Jaenshi\'s
Holiday", and to see him now is almost embarassing.  I guess some people can
be lured to any depths in pursuit of the almighty credit.

If this was all there was to this vid, I\'d give it one star, or two stars
based on the special effects and action sequences alone.  Many of you will
have noted by now that I gave it three and a half stars.  Many of you are
probably wondering why I\'ve even given it that many, since I\'ve panned it
pretty badly so far.  After you see this movie, you\'ll understand.  The Vilani
fashion model Liisha makes a stunning vid debut.  She is amazing as the sexy
and enigmatic Clarissa Hart.  All of the hype surrounding this release was
dead-on, at least about her.  She is able to take the most terrible, cliched
lines and perform them with such ability and grace that she alone makes the
movie.  The off-Solomani accent she puts on for this vid is very impressive,
especially since (according to her publicity corps) she has never taken an
acting lesson in her life.  Her facial expressions and body language show
clearly that she is that rare find, an actress with a raw, natural talent.  If
you watch this vid for no other reason, watch it to see her in action.  It
will take your breath away, and you\'ll love every minute of the movie while
she is on screen.  It makes you wonder what could be if she ever gets a good
role to work with.

And yes, as the closing credits roll that is Namidu Sharudkariin singing
"Kirugili Mashi Linuru (Love Under Glass)".  It amazes me that someone with
her credentials would agree to cut an original single for such a terrible
production.  Although I\'m no music critic, I\'d be willing to bet that this is
one cube that\'ll go lanthanum.

Please be as shocked as you want.  I also say that the next time a few AF

  I believe the EM-15 is the P.F.Sloan, though the hull config is wrong
(I would consider the Sloan a config 3 cylinder, not a cone). Check the
first issue of Challenge (#25?) and Fighting Ships (Supp #9).
  With capital ships going through a serious growth spurt between CT
and MT, you wouold be hard pressed to find other matches. Only the
Provincial Carrier has a near match, and there are (different) pictures
provided for the two designs...

>Where is the Tigress design from?  What is it?


 It\'s the largest design in Supplement 9: Fighting Ships (for CT).
At 500ktons disp it brooks no disagreements. One squadron of these
monsters is stationed at Rhylanor, and several more hold the blockade
at Andory and Candor (all circa 1110). It appears to have no parallel
within the pages of FSotSI.

>How much canonical information is there on Zhodani capital ship classes?


 Nothing concrete that I\'m aware of.
 The largest Zhodani designs to see print are 2000tons (the Vlezhdatl
by FASA and the Council Cruiser in the Zhodani Alien Module; both CT).
A couple of our local TML-gearheads have designed capital ships for the
Zhodani, but the names and URLs escape me at the moment.

Obviously they were both using TNE rules.  The LAPD Officer was an NPC
so he only had a few hit points.  The NVA sniper on the other hand was a

Entry #1:  Concert review from Magnum Magazine 141-1100

Concert Review:  Naamidu Sharudkariin Live on Vland

If you\'re a music fan in the Imperium, then you\'ve undoubtedly heard the
legendary Naamidu Sharudkariin, and if you haven\'t heard her, you\'ve at least
heard of her.  I happened to be the lucky reviewer that Magnum picked to catch
her highly touted concert on Vland.  Let me tell you, it was one of the most
amazing experiences I have had the pleasure to be involved with.

Naamidu got her start a decade ago after she graduated from the Akeshuna
School on Cameron in the Daibei sector.  According to her biography, her
parents shipped her to this school (a subsector and a half away) because they
were Vilani traditionalists, and they wanted to send her to a school that
taught the history, language, and culture of the "old ways".  She became
quickly fascinated with the beauty and splendor of Vilani folk music and
learned to play several antiquated instruments (even going so far as building
her own irkhamarzali when she couldn\'t find one for sale).  Her natural
musical talents and charming personality quickly gained her a devout group of
admirers on Cameron, many of whom she now employs as her ashushukshikhu or
"inner circle" on her tour.

Soon, her fame spread to even the non-Vilani on Cameron, and she became a huge
sensation.  Her self-produced demo album was beginning to get airplay on
nearby mainworlds, and she became an overnight sensation.  She was offered
several major cube deals, but held out until she was offered a lucrative
contract on the Muulamamku label, a subsidiary of the megacorporation
Makhidkarun.  Her cubes shot to the top of the charts, which was a surprise to
everybody, since she performed traditional Vilani arrangements in the original
language using the original instruments.  Her selfless determination to her
work is now almost legendary to anyone who watches the vids or reads the
trades.  She went out of her way to keep as much of the original sound intact
as possible, using none of the modern tricks of the trade.  Her musicvids were
low key, devoid of the flash and hype that most performers rely on these days.
She was a rare case, she managed to make it to the top on her music alone.
Her impact as a performer is felt in every corner of the Imperium, and quite
possibly even beyond.

She became a sex symbol for boys, earthy yet paradoxically ethereal, there was
something for every red-blooded Imperial male to latch onto.  She became a
wholesome idol for girls.  For the first time in memory, a performer came
along that kids could dig, and not be embarassed that their parents listened
to her too.

But, you probably already know all of this, unless you\'ve spent the past
decade in a cave.

Her live show on Vland was one of those rare instances when a concert is no
longer a concert, but instead becomes something more sublime, an event.  This
was all with good reason, since the concert had been five years in the
planning.  It was designed to be a celebration of the many facets of Vilani
culture, old and new, for Vilani and Vilanilekane (or "non-Vilani") alike.
Here, one could find many different traditional vilani dishes prepared by some
of the finest shugili, while they watched khigikha (short silent plays) on a
second stage.  Around the grounds, one could purchase all manner of Vilani
artifacts, ranging from adushirga (cheap plastic good luck charms, popular
among young girls today) to intricately crafted works of giingiinke art.  The
smells were mouth watering, the plays were wonderful, and the sampling of
Vilani culture was amazing.  With all honesty, not all of the food tasted as
good as it smelled, but it wasn\'t to hard to find something delicious.  Huge
vidscreens flanked the stage, and before the bands played, images were
supplied by the Dagaga artists collective.  It was hard not to fall into a
trance while watching the hypnotic images flash and dance on the screens.  The
whole place was wired for <InterAct vid> (known to many as InterActVid), which
explains why the scenes pulsed with the life of the crowd.

As the 72,000+ people that turned out for the concert soon found out when
Zadageseskhaarii took the stage at sunset, the place was wired for kaadmukim
(InterAct music) as well.  I had never had the pleasure of seeing this
underground group heat up the beat live before, and let me say it was one of
the most amazing experiences I\'ve ever had.  This group of asha kaadmukim
slapped the cubes like you would not believe.  The feeling of interacting with
over 72,000 bodies creating a unique, unrepeatable twisting, maddening,
intensely tribal show is just awe-inspiring.  I didn\'t see one person of any
persuasion that wasn\'t shaking their hips to the spiralling beats.  The beats
would speed up as the audience danced faster and faster, then, at the point of
exhaustion, the tempo would slow drastically, and the crowd would seem to die,
and after a brief respite, the beats would speed up again.  The experience of
oneness with the crowd was mind-altering.  I would venture to say you\'ve never
lived until you were a part of the Zadageseskhaarii hive (as they call their
fans).  As the crowd seemed to become more and more exhausted, the music
became more and more ambient, and over the course of almost an hour faded
away.  I was completely spent, the audience was completely spent.  Now I know
why no one ever chants for Zadageseskhaarii encore.

I would have thought that this band was a showstopper, if they stopped the
concert and told everyone to go home, I think they would have without any
trouble.  That all changed after teeny-bopper sensation Ugama took the stage!
The deliciously silly vidpop aura of this feel-good band brought the crowd
back to life in short order.  As they bopped and pogoed across the stage to
their zany beats and goofy lyrics, it was impossible not to bop, pogo and sing
along with them.  They played such wonderfully poppy tunes as "Khemka Igag
Enaka (Heartache Is Like Jumpsickness)", and "Amukir Shii (Happy Flower)".
They closed with their lanthanum hit single "Shepurgakhi (Hypertiny)", the big
surprise was that Naamidu herself came out and sang it duet-style with Ugama\'s
lead singer Uda Ugama!  I think every jaw on that field must have dropped!  I
would have never expected such a that strange situation would have unfolded
before my eyes.  After it was all over, she made a point of asking for Uda\'s
autograph, and said she was one of their biggest fans.  The crowd roared for
an encore, and they played three of the new songs from their upcoming album
including the title track, "Aarbekhisaku (Lollipop King)", but Miss
Sharudkariin did not come back out.

I did not care too much for the next band, Khakunasum (Cinderblock), as I\'m
not a fan of this whole genre of gushiimukim (chaos-noise/music).  They seemed
to be a hit among many of the older teens, however, and they did put on a
rather...  frightening show.  Their vidwork was custom, and displayed scenes
of graphic violence that was cut from Xboat newsfeeds of wars across the
Imperium, as well as grav car crashes, and scenes from ultraviolent horror
vids.  The crowd reacted in a violent, yet surprisingly controlled fashion, as
they moved with the rage of the music.  Their lyrics, bellowed, whispered,
spoken, screeched and distorted were mostly pointed attacks on Imperial
policy, especially towards member worlds, and they closed with
"Irdiriibisundun Mukidi (Rape of the Protected)" which was about the massacre
of a droyne reservation at the hands of a religious dictatorship while the
Imperial authorities looked on.  Even as I was not a fan, it was hard not feel
pain as these things were exposed in the night air.  As an interesting note,
all of the proceeds that Khakunasam received from this performance were
donated to "The Brotherhood of the Rorani", a watchdog group dedicated to
documenting and exposing the crimes against humaniti that some worlds are
known for.

Then came a lengthy intermission.  I looked at my watch, and an amazing five
hours had passed since Zadageseskhaarii came on stage!  Most of the crowd had
been there for at least eight hours, and none looked the least bit tired!  In
fact, they all seemed hyped up to see Naamidu\'s set.  Halfway through the
intermission, Naamidu came out onto the stage and informed the audience that a
there were several booths throughout the grounds that were selling special t-
shirts to commemorate the concert, and that the proceeds would be split
equally between "The Brotherhood of the Rorani" and Ipushashangaa (the
Heritage Foundation; a group dedicated to preserving the art and culture of
old Vland and the First Imperium).  Within a few moments, the supply of shirts
was completely exhausted (as it turns out, the shirts and independent
donations raised almost Cr750,000 for charity).

As the crowd wound down, Naamidu came out on stage in a regal, flowing gown,
her hair done up in the style of a musician of old Vland.  She cradled her
handmade irkhamarzali in her arms.  She introduced herself with her full
Vilani name, dipped into a small curtsy, and began to play.  The vidscreens
showed a close-up view of her upper body as she sang the very first song she
learned to play, a children\'s counting song called "Agi Shugili (the Proud
Food Preparer)".  At the end of this song, the crowd went wild with cheers,
and young children were raised up onto the shoulders of their parents and
older siblings.  She curtsied again, politely thanked the crowd for their
applause, and began playing her recent lanthanum single "Shiggikhigaagum (The
Joining of Hands)".  As she did so, the crowd joined hands and sang along, and
I saw tears in the eyes of many in the audience.  A chill went up my spine as
I realized once again what an event this was, and how lucky I was to be
watching, and tears welled up in my eyes as well as I sang along.  After she
finished that song, the crowd clapped, but there were no cheers and no hoots.
There was a mystic energy to the crowd, a collective release that was even
more wonderful and profound than when the whole crowd interacted as a hive
during the first band\'s set.  She went through the rest of her set in a
business-like fashion that is purely and uniquely Vilani.  Towards the end of
the set a nakashim was wheeled out, and she sat on the bench and played the
final grouping of her songs, finishing with her first single, "Ulusishamiska
Eragu (Song of the Veterans)".  After she left the stage, the applause was
thunderous and went on for at least fifteen minutes, swelling and dying and
swelling again.  Out of respect for Naamidu, they didn\'t chant for an encore
(it was her policy not to give them, as she sees no point in holding out on
her fans for the sake of applause).  But, she proved she was full of surprises
by coming out on the stage again.  She said quietly (in Vilani), "As you, my
fans, know, I give you everything I have to give to you when I come out on
stage.  As I walked off the stage tonight, I had a great and painful debate
with myself, and felt ashamed.  I have recently composed an original piece,
not my first, but the only one that I have felt is of a high enough quality to
give to an audience.  As I entered my dressing room, I noted with considerable
shame that I have not given you all I have to give.  I did keep something to

My only wish as I left the grounds of concert, content and blissfully aware of

Some minor errata and clarifications, Naamidu Sharudkariin\'s name is not
spelled correctly at the end of my "Tom Jetland" review.  If it seems strange
that Naamidu doesn\'t seem like to type to have a song on the "Tom Jetland"
soundtrack after you read the concert review, don\'t lose any sleep over it.
The situation will be explained in future postings.

Other than that, I am very proud of Naamidu.  She\'s probably one of the
coolest NPCs that I have ever created.  I have cut her out of the same cloth
as Tori Amos, so that may help you imagine what she\'s like.

Thanks for pointing out my error in mixing the two very different terms
dark matter and dark matter. As my regard for observational astronomers and
astrophysicist are very high and my regard for cosmologists is on par with
psychoanalysts/macro-economists I will for my own personal use adopt the
term "dark matter" for whatever stuff that doesn\'t shine such as dust,
brown dwarfs, beer cans and misjumped ships and for the cosmologists
version I\'ll simply call "handwave matter".

Back on topic: Someone (Bruce?) noted in passing a rule for getting rid of
all those White Dwarfs in already generated sectors. Something like M5 or
dimmer size VII should change to VI. Anybody have a reason for this, why
jsut there etc? I\'ll just need a rule that I haven\'t entirely plucked from
vacuum to rule my system generation from now on.

Is this a "fact" ie written down somewhere. Stuff like this is great to
collect and drop during lunch breaks. I\'ll give you one for free:
The terms sabotage supposedly comes from french female weavers (is that a
word, machine operators producing clothing fabrics). At some point the got
irritated of low wages/working conditions and used their wooden shoes to
damage the machines. These shoes are called "sabot" in french (yes the same
root for the military sabot term). So they "sabotaged" the factory.

Jeff Zeitlin calculated the number of berths sometime back (he noted in

No can do. The Vargr NEVER allow the players themselves throwing dice as
they\'re sooo good at cheating (swapping dice, Mercury filled cavities,
magnetic dot inks etc). If the Croupier rolls only he can cheat which is
how it is done in the Vargr extents.

OK, I\'ll put forth some criticism. Please note that I found your posts very
interesting and the critique below is only there to tell you what I found
qestionable from a standpoint of my Traveller universe.

>Her self-produced demo album was beginning to get airplay on
>nearby mainworlds, and she became an overnight sensation.

Call the music pieces something other than "albums". The term seem very
20th century earth centric and actually a bit oldfashioned in the 1990s as
well. Call them cubes, song-group, fiche, file, block etc or something in
Vilani. ALso I found the term "airplay" questionable on the same grounds.
Use feedtime, hitcounts, use, loads or something.

Refrain from using today terms:
"...something for every red-blooded Imperial male..."
"But, you probably already know all of this, unless you\'ve spent the past
decade in a cave."
Perhaps:
"But, you probably already know all of this, unless you\'ve spent the past
decade in hyperspace/low passage."
"That all changed after teeny-bopper sensation Ugama took the stage!
The deliciously silly vidpop aura of this feel-good band brought the crowd
back to life in short order.  As they bopped and pogoed across the stage to
their zany beats and goofy lyrics, it was impossible not to bop, pogo and sing
along with them."

However they also give the mass of big freighters and Super Dreadnaughts as
about 7,000,000 tons, which at standard densitys would be around the 500kT
displacement mark.

Sorry I can\'t even flog the book for you - the only copy I ever saw was in
our local library, and it went missing years ago. He also wrote a couple of
books on submarine and modern warship design, I think. I never got to read
tham, blast it. They would\'ve been even more relevant to Traveller starship
design, because both types of vessel are volume more than mass limited,
unlike BB design.

Recently a friend got me excited about playing Traveler. I had played it a
few years back so I was familiar with the system and the always enjoyable
character generation. However once me and another friend made our
characters, the GM was at a loss of what to do with us. What do you think?

My character\'s first two terms were with the Scouts as were my friend
John\'s. Unfortunately I was wounded so I had to carry on in another career
while John went on as a scout. In my two terms I had rolled performance
twice and chose music as the cascade skill. The lonely scout out rimward
keeping himself company with his guitar-equivalent. I couldn\'t go into
another military service so I thought I would try out the enetertainment
field.

Let\'s just say we got a little excited rolling dice and after John got out
of the scouts he joined me in the band. After ... um, a few more terms ...
we had reached the safe / obligatory age to carry on an adventuring career.
I had carried on in the band for several terms and John for a few as well.
Rather a healthy music career since when we rolled up our muster benefits we
had four yachts between us and several thousand credits.

Now I\'ll admit it sounds absurd but imagine rolling up a character that
becomes as legendary as the Stones, or Pink Floyd, etc. We just had to play
them. Especially since we traded in two of the yachts for a lab ship which
is the space-going tour bus / chemical factory / casino. The Traveller
equivalent of the Grateful Dead.

And the GM, an excellent GM in most games, had just gotten so involved that
he was just as excited as us. He wanted to start in the beginning of the
Imperium, in the Holiday year. So my character, having Carousing and Music
at 5 and a social score of 12, felt it only appropriate that I plan the
Coronation and play as well. Its only natural. He gave me an impossible
skill test, which I barely passed, and the whole party was quite memorable.
He had a hard time coming up with what to do with us so we\'ve became
basically self-styled emissaries and started the Rimward Tour to begin off
the new Imperium.

Is this ludicrous? Anyone have ideas for him? Can you play aging rockers and
survive?

Believe me its a lot of fun to say the least.

GGW

BTW - If anyone wants to see the right up of my character\'s history I\'ll
send it along.

Couldn\'t agree more.  I\'ve been working on fixing that problem.  You
should see what my brother did with the Midu Agashaam.  But I agree,
the BI-15 and (IMO) the Rift Cruiser looked good.  One of the cruisers
looked decent too.  The others are typical "Vilani" inspired designs
and could use some rethought to be made to look more interesting.

No arguing that canon says 500,000 - 1,000,000 Td.  I\'m just saying
that we should design ships to match the art.  If we want big ships
as the art indicates (IMO, the art shows ships with multikilometer
dimensions, having seen most ship typoes in the world today).  My
brother, who has flown past carriers at mach+, thinks they are actually
small.

Sadly, in spite of having been exposed to first aid training, many
people don\'t recognize the sysmptoms when *they* go into shock. 

I\'ve "gotten shocky" more times than I care to remember. I have this
unfortunate tendency to operate my body *way* too close to the limits. 

Luckily, one time fairly early on, a nurse friend realized what was
going on and made me lie down, get warm etc. After that I learned what
"shock" felt like. So I can do something about it before it does
something to me.

Shock can be *very* insidious.

Aside from "corscrewing" being difficult to carry out, it may still be
possible to treat that ship and a single *other* ship as a 2-d situation.
Especially when you relize that any manuevers involving the "third"
dimension in such a situation are a *waste* of delta-V.

After getting walked all over on r.a.s.s, I\'m not going to say that you
*can\'t* use 2D for such a situation. Remember, nothing states that the
"reference plane" has to be "stationary" as viewd by an outside observer.

That\'s a *prolate* spheroid. An oblate spheroid is a lof of
pumpernickel or the the like. More technically, you get a prolate
spheroid ny rotating an ellipse about its major axis. It looks like a
ball that has been stretched.

You get an oblate spheroid by rotating the ellipse about the minor
axis. It looks like a ball that has been *squashed*.

Actually, now that you\'ve jogged my memory, the mere act of
"bombarding" hydrogen with low energy mesons (muons, as I recall) 
makes fusion possible at *very* low temperatures and pressures. 

What happens is that negative muons replace the electrons in the atoms.
But due to various quantum considerations, this reults in the muon\'s
"orbit" being almost "inside" the nucleus!

That means that the atoms can come close enough for a greatly increased
chance of fusion *without* the need for high temperatures (to ionize
the atoms). You\'d still want a fair amount of pressure as that pushes
the atoms closer together.

Then only reason "muonic" fusion isn\'t being worked on is that it is
very hard to produce the muons, and they decay too quickly to be of use.

But give a source of muons that can produce larger numbers of them at
low energy costs, you\'ve got your fusion technology.

Also, "muonic" atoms of heavier elements are likely to be part of the
process of creating superdense. Given a "muon projector" you could
"collapse" ordinary matter rather easily. It\'s *stabilizing* it that\'s
a pain.

I was nodding along with you until that last line. Anyplace that gets
visited regularly by ships *will* have radios or satellite phone
equivalents. *Especially* when folks are several days travel apart.
Take a good look at northern Canada and Alaska, or any number of third
world countries. 

The people (or at least the *villiages* get radios or phones as soon as
they can scrape the cash together, if the government doesn\'t supply one
first. Governments like them, because it lets them get by with fewer
troops and fewer "medical officers". People like them because they mean
that they can call for a doctor, or give or receive warnings about
bandits and troops from neighboring countries. And they can call into
the "big" towns for advice on crops, planting, and medicine. And for
isolated farms, cabins, etc not only do they provide contact with other
people, but if you miss checking in a couple days in a row, folks will
be headed out the fastest way then can, because you must be in trouble!

What you *will* run into (assuming a model more like the Yukon than
the third world) is:

"Joe\'s on channel 237. But there\'s no point calling him until the
afternoon. Mornings he\'s pretty busy with chores, and he goes to bed
pretty early. But late afternoon, or early evening, he\'ll be swapping
news with the other farmers."

"What? Oh yeah, you *could get hold of him with an emergency signal
most any time. But folks get *real* unhappy with anybody what uses an E
signal when it ain\'t a real emergency."

Likewise, I bet there\'s *some* sort of faster transport around the
port, but again, it\'s likely reserved for "Doc" to use in emergencies,
and is probably a *very* old air raft or even some sort of aircraft.

Just because the place is "low TL" and higher TL stuff is expensivbe,
people *will* find a way to get high tech stuff that *works* for them.
Try finding a place on earth where there aren\'t transistor radios, for
instance. 

And as I\'ve noted elsewhere, any planet that didn\'t *develop* a wired
comm net on its own will likely never have one. Once contacted, its
*much* cheaper to put up a low level satellite telephone net like the
ones just coming into service here on earth. The satellites are
*cheap*, and you need less than 100. The units the folks on the ground
use aren\'t that much different from a cell phone. For a low tech world
you\'make the ground units tabletop-sized, so as to make swapping boards
easier, and likely use larger rechargable batteries and solar cells.

They\'d still be less than 100 credits each. And even in a place where
that was a months wages, or even a *years* wages, you\'d find them.
Villages go together to buy that sort of thing now. And the richer
farmers/landholders would want their own.

I think this is part of the fun of Traveller. Having the players learn
that "low tech" *doesn\'t* necessarily mean "stupid" *or* "ignorant".

It is quite possible that the molecules being skimmed are in a more complex
form than straight Hydrogen (or Deuterium which is H(subscript)2.

I had a discussion in this forum about scooping water awhile back.  It
seems (according to the other person in the discussion) that one cubic
meter of water refines to much more than one cubic meter of Liquid
Hydrogen.  Now, don\'t ask me to argue for this position, I\'m not a chemist
or physicist and don\'t play one on TV.  If this is true, however, you can
scoop your 40 tons of water (and presumably some other compounds) and
refine 50 tons of Liquid Hydrogen out of it.

I hope that person can come on nd explain better than I.

Definately!!!

Do you have the latest version of the demo? The one with a US price of $26.

It should be available at my software site:

I\'ll check myself tonight.

The PC version won\'t be available in time for this CD - unless a miracle

   My copy of the MT:PM has the error (same as in Book 7), and I 
either noticed the problem or read some errata, because I crossed 
out (too many moons ago) one of the Steward results and written in 
Pilot on the Free Trader Business table.

while, unless a huge bug is discovered.

Features in this version:
  Simon Early added to the contributers list, for his excellent work on the
Excel macro code.
  EXCEL ONLY: Added the SaveDesign and LoadDesign macros, to save the ship
in a "lighter" text format, to conserve disk space. SaveDesign is called by
ctrl+s, LoadDesign is called by ctrl+l.
  Fixed external cargo pods mass and volume - volume was too high, mass was
too low.
  Fixed PA and Meson damage values based on FFS2 errata.
  Fixed backup fuel purification plants.
  Fixed fuel cost on economics page.
  Fixed Screen crew count - wasn\'t including damper turrets.
  Fixed crew totals - wasn\'t including screens.
  Fixed drive and magazine problems on missile sheet 2.
  Fixed atmospheric speeds.
  Changed hull pricing again (at Bruce Macintosh\'s request). Hull paint
credits are based on percentages, as beforebut the costs for military black
and ultrablack are back to the original method - based on hull area and a
fixed cost.
  Changed the TLSet macro code to be more efficient.
  Split code into Excel and Quattro Pro versions for macro support.

The code has been split into Excel and Quattro versions solely for the
macros - VBA isn\'t supported in Quattro. So why Quattro and not 1-2-3, or
Claris Works? Simple - Quattro is what I own and use. I\'ve been publishing
this spreadsheet in Excel format becuase I figured it was the most common
product - but the sheet was written in Quattro and converted (and macros
added) at my box at my job, which has Excel.

Thus, there are no immediate plans for a 1-2-3 (or other product)
version...but if anyone converts the sheet to another version, let me know,
and I\'ll put your version up along with the Excel and Quattro versions.

As usual, the sheet is freely available at my traveller web site:

www.ames.net/igor/trav/trav.htm

Just go to the drydock page.

The spreadsheet will also be on the soon-to-be released Traveller CD
project - I just have to send the newest file and text description to the
gentleman burning the CD.

Really?  I had always thought that the name had the same root, but the action
was attributed to Dutch partisans in a factory during the Nazi occupation.
I\'ve always wondered about the age of the term though...

There was an anarchist bookstore in my area called the Wooden Shoe, and they
had a poster on the wall explaining the story.  Then later, a friend of mine
watched a WWII documentary and relayed the ol\', "you know where the term
sabotage came from?" line.  I\'d always been interested to know how old the
term was, in case it predated the 1940s.

The density of liquid hydrogen is something like 0.07 ton/m3 while water is
1 ton per m3. This means that for every liter(kg) of water you\'ll get 0.07
kg of LH2 or double that of Deuterium.
The amount of hydrogen in water is 2 per 18 or slightly less than 10% which
means that for every ton of water youll get slightly less than 100 kg of
LH2 which occupies quite a bit more than 1 m3.
It may seem strange but it\'s a fact. A weirder thing though is that if
instead of empty fuel tanks you were to store your LH2 inside SOLID metal
you could pack more than 10x the amount!!! Yes, a solid block of titanium
can hold 10x more hydrogen than an empty container of the same dimensions.

Airplay I did think about before I put it in.  It was a tough choice, but I
finally settled on airtime just as a standard word that would get across the
point.  Album I didn\'t give a second choice for, although the term is now
archaic, it is still used commonly in the US to refer to...  um...  an album\'s
release, whether it be on CD or cassette, or even those minidiscs.

Hey, there are still caves in the Traveller universe! :^)  But nonetheless,
your point still taken.  As it were, I used 20th century slang mostly because
I didn\'t want to pull a Clockwork Orange and make the slang too strange.  I
was going to use more 3I \'flavor slang\', but I didn\'t want to have to go and
put a glossary at the end of the posting, besides, you know how hard it is to
come up with believable slang?  Multi-million dollar advertising firms try to
foist new slang on us all the time, but they rarely, if ever, succeed!  :^).

 Sorry I can\'t even flog the book for you - the only copy I ever saw was in
 our local library, and it went missing years ago. He also wrote a couple of
 books on submarine and modern warship design, I think. I never got to read

 design, because both types of vessel are volume more than mass limited,

Try the book " Battleships and Battlecruisers, 1905-1970"  It is a very well
written reference book on every class of BB or BC produced in that period
(includinig the final resting places of most!  :-)  )  The author escapes me
at the moment, but it should be available thru Military Book Club if nothing
else.

I love it!  Snoop around until you find the issue of JTAS that has "Road
Show" by John Ford in it.  All sorts of fun thing sto do to a musical party.

Until then, read Pamela DeBarr\'s autobiography "I\'m With The Band" for some
fun ideas on the trouble a touring group can have.  Also, rent "This is
Spinal Tap."

A revolution starts while you are playing.  A crooked manager tries to
embezzle the receipts from a concert.  A Duke\'s daughter runs off to follow
you, and he blames you for it.  You mis-jump into a religious theocrasy
that has declared your music blasphmous.  All sorts of fun.

If you are having fun playing, and the Referee is having fun running it, go
for it!  I know of no rule stating that Traveller games have to revolve
around mercenaries or merchants getting in gun battles every five minutes.

>Believe me its a lot of fun to say the least.

Sounds like it.

My bad.  I meant Dean, but Don came out.  Although, I would not mind seeing
Don Martin & Jerry Lewis do a film sometime.

Sort of, and this is an excellent example of how urban legends change.
Actually these \'saboteurs\' date from even earlier in the Industrial
revolution. They were cottage weavers protesting against the
mechanization of their industry; the group and term \'Luddites\' date from
this time as well, and are the English counterparts of the French
\'Saboteurs\'.

Number 4 I\'d really like to buy - yes, buy. You should charge cash for your
shareware project, at least as much as 1 to 3 books from IG. If the payment
hassle bothers you take a look at Kagi shareware that handles shareware
payments via creditcard, seerialnumbers etc for you.

In a campaign a while ago, when characters were part of a privateer/corsair group.  There was a tradition of a beating being given to the first crewmenber aboard a new starship.  This was later by popular demand made to be the first crew member returning from shore leave or a mission.  The good thing about the Vargr is that
they can cringe and get away from the beating lightly, but at a loss of Charisma.

Does this custom start from a Traveller canon concept ?


Gangs

Does anyone have details of Vargr corsair gangs

In the same campaign there were a couple of strange groups of corsairs.

The most notorious was the Travolta gang, who had an amazing crew a virtually incredible starship and a very unstable commander.  The Vargr commander modeled himself on John Travolta from Grease, and had his hair done in a teddy boy style.  Sometimes they would just zing by a merchantman and subject them to a lot of music from various 50s and 60s groups, any comments on the choice of music however would be treated as a personal insult against the commander of the ship.  Needless to say, they were a menace to the space lanes and to many sane Naval Captains.


The other gang was a group of French Poodle Vargr in various primary colours who talked with a very strange French accent.  These might even resort to giving outrageous haircuts to captives, especially if they were
the typical stock of Vargr.

- ----

Since its first edition, Traveller character generation always favored
military and business careers. I agree that Trade is the blood of the
Empire, Army, Navy and Scouts could represent muscles and nerves,
Nobility is the brain, but what about the skeleton?

The Technician career represents the people who serve the Imperium in
roles requiring both high levels of technical competence and a certain
level of guts.
Despite the general lack of combat skills, I consider this career to be
eminently viable for PCs. Just like in the case of Agent and Artist, you
should remember that this "lifepath" could represent many different
things, depending on your EDU, homeworld TL and the final mix of skill.

You could also use this career for Army Engineering Corps (Sappers). In
this case, you should proceed as for the Army career (i.e. use Army
tables for commission, promotion, re-enlistment, injury, mustering out
and automatic skills) but use the Technician tables whenever you need to
roll for a skill gain. You will end with a PC which has Rifle-1 (and
perhaps SMG-1 if s/he is an officer), a military rank, army retirement
pay (if applicable), weapons and a load of technical skills.

The following are some suggestion for giving "flavor" to PC careers.
All offer some element of danger and exposure to different environments
and TLs and could form a good starting point for a Traveller character.
Remember that depending mostly on factors like EDU and SOC, this career
could represent both the high (top-salary consultants, architects) and
the low (stellar junk yard mechanic, belter) end of the scale.

- - Crisis Intervention Specialist (Fireman, Bomb Disposal squad, control
  of natural or man-made disasters like floods or car wrecks).
- - Hostile Environment WorkForce (Building, mining or salvage crews in
  deepspace, underwater or other hostile environments).
- - Prospecting, bootstrap Missions on low TL worlds.
- - Infrastructure (Building roads or other communication networks. Dams,
  space stations and other large scale projects).
- - Ecological damage assessment/reduction.
- - Technical consulting/workforce on archaeological sites.


The Technician career is presented in a format compatible with the
current edition of Traveller (T4), plus some additional notes and skills
derived from older editions of the Traveller system.

                            Technician

Troubleshooting is what keeps the Imperium alive. When troubles are
caused by sophonts, you usually call for Agents, or even the Army. In
all other cases, a Technician will probably serve you much better. From
the depth of space to the depth of oceans, from the Board of Directors
of a MegaCorporation to the seediest parts of the Starport, you should
always secure the advice of a veteran Tech before launching yourself in
a new adventure.
Routine tasks: Building, assessing or repairing devices, vehicles or
buildings. Acting as a consultant to governments or corporate
executives. Directing crew of workmen and coordinating large scale tasks
and projects.

Rank & Service Skills:
All: _Technical_ 1

Notes:
The _Equipment_ result represents the Tools of the Trade which your
technician will have accumulated during his/her career. 
The best way to treat this is to give the player 5000 cr. for each
Equipment result. The money can be used only to buy tools, protective
gear like VaccSuits (no military armor) and other reasonably portable
equipment (i.e., grav belts would be reasonable if a tad extreme, while a
submarine is not).
Multiple _Equipment_ results can be cumulated to buy a costly item,
but any residual "credit" after buying the stuff will be lost and
cannot be converted in regular money (but if they really want a Grav
Belt, you may allow them to pool the _Equipment_ results with normal
cash to reach the desired amount).

New Skills for Technicians.
- ----
Engineering:Civil [Technical Cluster]
Represents the character expertise in designing, building and
maintaining large structures like houses, mining stations, bridges,
space habitats and other similar projects.
The skill my be used to operate specialized construction equipment,
(including cargo loaders) and as a favorable DM to Perception rolls
when inspecting blueprints, maps, geological data or the buildings
themselves.

Engineering:Combat [Technical Cluster]
Combat Engineering involves the rapid construction of field
fortifications, their camouflage, the assessment of their ability to
withstand enemy fire, mine placement and clearance and placement of
untended ground sensors. Main stat is usually EDU, but INT may be used
when dealing with new, unfamiliar situations or equipment.
Engineering:Combat skill levels may be used as positive DM to rolls when
trying to detect booby traps, mine fields and camouflaged installation,
either with visual inspection (Perception roll) or using specialized
technology (Sensors).
Use the skill level as negative DM when others try to detect the
character\'s emplacements.
This skill should be available to members of the Military
Forces only.

Sonic Knife [Adapted from Larry Niven\'s Ringworld RPG - Chaosium]
...........

TL: 14
LL: 9+
Cost: 300 cr.
To use: Easy Dex+Mechanics Task.

This device is similar to an slightly oversized pen, with a thin cable
connecting one of the extremities to a small power battery, usually worn
on the belt or strapped to a limb of the user.
The unit must be held pressed against the surface you want to cut. It
can be used in vacuum, under water or in exotic atmospheres and
generates an amazingly low heating effect in the cut material. It is
also fairly quiet, generating only an almost inaudible buzz.
The power pack weights 1 kg and allows 30 min. (360 rounds) of
continuous operation.
The knife can cut through most materials commonly used in the industry.
The cutting speed varies according the user\'s strength and the material
toughness, as shown in the table below.

Starting at TL14 you can easily obtain special plastics which, besides
being easily cut by the sonic knife, can be seamlessly weld together
using the same tool. They are available in various forms (panels,
cables, rug-like rolls, fabrics, boxes and assorted containers) and are
extensively used in different industries.

The tool acts as a sort of combination drill/saw/shears and works best
along previous welds and joints. Thanks to his shape, you can use a
ruler or any other straight object to guide the knife action. It\'s
mainly designed for precision work, lacking the power to cut stronger
stuff. It is less dangerous than a laser cutter, but it can be used to
cut trough doors, for example, so high law level worlds (especially low
TL ones) would prefer to restrict ownership of this devices.

The following values for material strengths are CSV-based. If you prefer
FF&S2 you will have to adjust numbers a little :

Notes on the table:

Material and TL.
Name of the material and TL at which is introduced. For plastics use
either Wood or Stone.
Thickness.
For the various materials the three given thickness represent a Rigid
Armor value of 1, 2 and 3, except for Crystalliron, which has AV 3 at the
listed thickness.
The Sonic Knife can\'t be used with stronger stuff.
Time.
Time required to make a STR cm. cut in a slab of the given thickness,
given in 5-sec turns. For example, an A STR individual can cut 10 cm of
a .12 soft steel panel in 12 turns (1 minute).

Lighter objects (fabric, thin cables and any stuff with no appreciable
armor value) can be cut at 100xSTR cm/turn.

Players being players, they will try to use the sonic knife as a weapon.
The tool contains microsensors which cut off power when pressed against
something which it recognizes as flesh or other organic compounds (you
can use it to cut leather, for example, but not for beef).
Most models can be set to switch off when pressed against Vacc suits,
too.
Players being players, they will soon ask to deactivate the safety
circuits [Difficult Electronics+Int task. Failure will break the tool].
The vibrating effect is not really designed for soft, living tissue,
though. The sonic knife will damage tissues (resulting in bruising
first, then a bloody pulp) at a rate of 1D6/Round.


Memory Coils [Adapted from Larry Niven\'s Ringworld RPG - Chaosium]
............

TL: 14
LL:
Cost: Varies. See below for details.
To use: Average (Engineering, Mechanics or Demolition)+Int Task. The
        appropriate skill must be chosen according to the situation.

A broad family of specially constructed memory plastic bands, they can
act as ties, clamps, connectors and other similar applications.
Most coils are 1 cm. wide and packaged in flat, concentric loops. They
act as cheap throw away substitutes for heavy-duty pulleys, straps and
mechanical saws. All have a maximum expansion (see table below) and
contract to 1/100th of their length.
Memory coils can cut down trees, pull jail cell together, hoist
vehicles, crack walnuts, open cans hold gear to the hull of a vehicle,
act as an emergency tourniquet and much more.
The contraction is usually triggered by a chemical agent or a
pre-specified electrical current. The tightening effect takes 1 min x
meter of length. Any coil can be used only once, and must then be cut
away (Sonic Knifes are good for it, requiring no more than 1 round to do
so) or dissolved by a specially designed catalyst (cost: 10 Cr./dose).

Microfoil (Original idea and text by SemoFetus <SemoFetus@aol.com>)
.........

TL: 9+
LL: unrestricted
Cost: a standard "block" (30cm x 30cm x 100 sheets) will cost 2500 cr.
      (See below for additional notes on cost.)
To use: Average (Engineering, Mechanics or Demolition)+Dex Task. The
        appropriate skill must be chosen according to the situation.


Starship crews, surface teams, military and mercenary units, and those
in the civilian sector all have a need to join metals at one time or
another.  Tanks of fuel and oxygen require a good deal of volume and can
be quite heavy.

Microfoil is the solution to this problem.  Microfoil is made up of a
number of extremely thin layers consisting of boron, carbon, silica or
aluminum combined with a transition metal.  The different components are
selected carefully to ensure a self-propagating, high temperature
exothermic reaction when exposed to a small amount of heat (such as the
spark from a battery, or a match or lighter, for example).  The
temperature is high enough to melt a filler to make a weld.  The thinner
the layer, the less time the reaction takes, and the less time oxygen
has to mix with the metals, so the joints are stronger then those welded
with more traditional welding equipment.  The layers of foil are
generally between 20 atoms and 2,000 nanometers across.

The technology is introduced at TL9, but it is prohibitively expensive
due to the exacting specifications the foils must be made to.  At TL10,
the production process is refined, but still rather expensive.  By TL12,
microfoil can be made cheaply and easily.
Microfoil welding kits will vary in mass and price, due mostly to the
availability of the filler metals and the strength of the joints
required. Most members of a starship engineering crew, as well as combat
engineers and many mechanics will have thick pen-sized electrical
"sparkers" to perform on the spot welds when required.  The foils
themselves mass very little (the average packet weighs about as much as
a small notepad, and contains several hundred applications).

TL9     Cr2,000 per application.  (About 25-50% more for starship hull grade)
TL10    Cr500 per application.  (About 10-25% more for starship hull grade)
TL11    Cr25 per application.  (No extra change for starship hull grade)


Water Tools  [Adapted from Larry Niven\'s Ringworld RPG - Chaosium]
...........

TL: 14
LL: unrestricted
Cost: 
To use: Easy Mechanics+Int Task to correctly prepare a batch of tools.
Another application of memory plastics. A small (12 x 19 cm, 0.1 mm
thick, 5 gm) page of memory plastic is imprinted with the specifications
of the tool (an hammer, for example). By placing the page in a container
holding a specified quantity of distilled water, the molecules of the
page realign themselves and the water according to a specified design,
resulting in a complete, graspable tool.
The resulting piece will last 1 hour and then dissolve back in an
unrecoverable goo.
The life of the tool may be prolonged to 24 hours by applying a
pre-set electrical current to the object, and a special spray coating
will help stalling decay for a week. After this period, the object will
quickly dissolve.
Memory tools are usually produced in "books" of simple mechanical
devices, special containers and so on. The final mass of the tool is
equal to the mass of the ingredients minus 1%

Sample Memory Tools

Item                      Price
hammer (book of 10)        25 cr.
coveralls (adjust size     40 cr.

gloves (book of 100)       15 cr.
filter mask                50 cr.
wrench set (100 assorted)  35 cr.
rivets and expansion bands 25 cr. x 10
maintenance spray          60 cr. (10 applications)




Broomstick [from _2010 the second Odissey_ by A.C.Clark ]
..........

TL: 9
LL: unrestricted
Cost: Cr.100
To use: When used in the appropriate situation (see below) Zero-g,this
        tool gives a bonus to the relevant skill. The bonus is equal to
        user\'s skill or +3, whichever is lower. (i.e. if you have
        EnvCmbt[Zero-g] 1, the broomstick gives you an additional +1, if
        you have 4+ in EnvCmbt[Zero-g], it gives you no more than +3)

The broomstick (originally a Solomani designation, carrying obscure
cultural references) is a simple but amazingly versatile device used by
people which operate in Zero-g environments for protracted periods of
time. In cases where reaction-based (which need to be periodically
recharged) or gravitical modules (which are still too costly to issue to
a large workforce) would prove impractical, a simple broomstick will
often prove more than adequate.
The broomstick is usually carried around as a 1 meter stick with a metal
cable noodle at an end and a foothold (which can double as a hook or
handle) at the other.
The device can telescopically extend to five or six times the original
length by mechanical switches which trigger internal coils.
A broomstick is usually built to broadly fit its user\'s mass, and can be
used both to propel the user for short distances (by releasing the coil
after positioning one of the ends against a surface) and to stop
movement in zero-g (by positioning it against a surface an letting the
coil absorb the inertial movement of the user).
The relevant skill in T4 is Env.Combat[Zero-g], which represents the
ability of maneuvering in Zero-g. Older Traveller edition had specific
skills (like Zero-G combat) which can be used as well.
Vacc-Suit alone does not confer any proficiency with the broomstick.

I know that we can design ships this large using the existing rules (if we
apply some fix to the surface area problem), but the question is, how well
do the existing combat systems scale to them?

Battle Rider provides a nice up-scale combat system, although it doesn\'t
scale down so well.  I don\'t recall if it scales up past a million tons.
I haven\'t seen a version of the T4 tech arch that scales up that far...
did they ever give the equations that were used to derive the USP factor
table?  (No, I don\'t have FFS2 yet, shame on me. :)

Fascinating!  Perhaps this synergy of mesonics and nuclear damper
technology forms teh basis ofnot only higher TL fusion plants, but
allows the metastable states that comprise superdense materials
as well as bonded &coherent SD.  Hmm. 

Mesonics at TL11
Hadronics at TL12
Greatly enhanced fusion at TL13

Sounds like a clear technological progression to me.

Thanks Leonard!

Andy Akins spreadsheet actually does FFS2 ship design very nicely - I would

Does anybody out there have stats on this?  What Anders is saying
is true, at least qualitatively.  I\'m interested in investigating
this as a method of fuel storage, that is, inside the hull armor
matrix of the ship.  Fuel tanks would be soli instead of voids,
and could thus store 10 times as much furl, while enhamcing ship
integrity (given that the right materials were selected).  Does
anyone know the physical principles at work here?

Statement for attack:

	A J-6 ship requires 60% hull volume to tank its fuel.

	Application of this technology would allow a J-6 ship 
	to store its jump fuel in one tenth of that volume, i.e.
	6% of the hull.  Granted, 6% hull of titanium or similar
	hydrogen absorbing material would be massive, but could
	be constructed to enhance the ships structural integrity.

	Yes, I am aware of hydrogen embrittlement in certain materials.
	This is just a topic for thought and exploration.  BTW, there 	was an
article on thisin a recent DISCOVER magazine.

That surface area problem is a phantom.  Just calculate the real
surface area from solids that represent the ship.

By this I mean that you must select the compoenent solids from
which the ship is constrcted and carefully meantally piece them
together, calculating the resulting surface areas and volumes.

This is how I work.  Its tough, but without a CAD program, its
the only way.  And it works!

Very fine work.  This just got added to the official documents for my game.

Most of the technicians also carry around large quantities of two other tools:

MagicSeal: a special substance that bonds to most materials, but not flesh
or a special fabric, and produces a bond as string as a good weld.  (Not
surprisingly, this is marketed under the name GreyTape, even though it is a
gel.)

Lamprey: a generic data sucker, designed to interface with all sorts of
equipment from simple cables, optics, and holo data channels.  It has a
fast, dedictaed computer programmed with darn near every protocal the
designers could find.  Using this, a tech can start to get useful
information on virtually any device, given time.

Sure, and with a couple or three technological breakthroughs would work
like a charm. The first problem is the rate of infusion into the solid,
right now that takes a *long* time. The second problem is the extraction
of the hydrogen from the soild, right now that\'s much too slow for any
of the Jump Drive theories that require the hydrogen in massive
quantites over a period of minutes. Third you have the effect of the
hydrogen on the soild, right now the best candidates get brittle pretty
quickly so you couldn\'t use them as structural support.

Another idea you might want to consider is storing the hydrogen as
slush.  This was proposed a few years ago for rocket design. You get
improved storage density and a *little* additional structural support
over storing the H2 as a liquid.  IIRC, the slush was "melted" by
cycling hydrogen through the nozzle walls to preheat it and back through
the storage tanks using some of the waste heat to liquify the hydrogen
slush.

My second group of players decided to go the \'master criminal\' route. They
formed a rock band to tour the Spinward Marches, cleverly disguising their
burglary gear as stage props. (We\'ve just seen Thief. We were inspired.)
Other then what was needed to run the "Crime of the Century Tour" (we were
also into Supertramp) they donate the results to charity, on the
assumption that when they were eventually caught there would be a
groundswell of popular support.

Wild, crazy, and the most fun you can have in public. While the Band
serenades the Marquis with "Crime of the Century", the Ramp Rats steal his
jewels.

There I go not reading all before responding.  Sorry Eris.  Note to do
this we need to figure out how much pressure/grav/nuc damping we need to
do to compact this stuff.

Anybody know the properties LM Hyd can be created under, other than
Jupiter?  If only Jupitr, what is the pressure at the core.  IIRC
Jupiter is 3.0 g at the "surface," but that drops off as you get
deeper.  Pressure increases, though.

I\'ll bet that the Spinward Marches is filled with all kinds of fashion don\'ts
then :^)

Imagine the horrified look that a trendy Core noble would have as he ventured
to the Spinward Marches on business and saw all of the out-of-date fashions...

Then imagine the horrified looks on all of his friend\'s faces when he got back

As I think of this I am reminded of the line in Tombstone (concerning the town
itself):  "...where the latest Parish fashions are sold from the backs of

One of my favorite novels is Queen of Angels by Greg Bear. Partially 
this was precisely because the reader is dropped right into the 
center of the story, complete with the \'modern\' slang/slant. It took 
me a chapter or two to get the rhythm of it and stop struggling to

The way I see it sort of is that each individual world is going to have its
own culture and its own feel.  The problem with that, for me at least, is when
I run my campaign, I run it from week to week, and its difficult to tell where
the PCs might stop, let alone where they\'ll stay for a long time.  I can (and
do) put different goals in adventures on different planets, and it generally
keeps them to a straight line, but it is very difficult to come up with
interesting stuff each week for each world.  There are only so many different
customs and leaders and mainworlds you can deal with from week to week...

    Well...  IMTU I see the Syleans having been reduced to something like the
American Indians were by the mid-Twentieth Century by the Vilani.  Stubbornly
clinging to the fragments of their culture and language and having been
shuffled off onto near worthless territories and persecuted for not
assimilating themselves into Vilani society.  Then when the Terrans show up
they revolt!
    Since there was only ONE Terran on Sylea at the time, Lt. Johnathan
Winterhawke, he negotiated a settlement which gave the Syleans ever increasing
autonomy and made them allies to the increasing Solomani presence into the Rule
of Man.  By the time of the Long Night the distinct and seperate minority
Sylean culture was allied to the Solomani on Sylea and they both controlled the
world in the face of the Vilani majority.
    In Mileau 0 the Syleans maintain a distinct culture on their homeworld
which is rather much admired by the native nobility.  IMTU Cleon actually has
made Imperial Decrees setting aside territory and priviledges for the native
Syleans.  OC IMTU Cleon has a favorite Grandmother who was full blooded Sylean
and the Syleans have a tradition of being safe servants to the Nobility and
Imperial Palace.  But that\'s my take on them, more as a footnote then anything
else.

Yes, this is something that I have thought of.  But, its tough to implement.
My own bet would be that most revivals that would take place would be more or
less Vilani in nature, since they are the most numerous of the starfaring
human races.

Its easy for the Terrans to come along and say, "Now you have to speak our
language", but traditions and entertainments tend to stick around even
further.

That\'s a good point.  But of course, when you have such a melting pot of races
and cultures floating around, the highest form of drama could be something
that was never even popular here...

Yes.  Its difficult to postulate what will happen between now and the far
future.  There\'s a lot of time and different cultures that are in that span.
Technology is easy.  Its tough to try and imagine the entertainment of the far
future.  Its tough enough to imagine the entertainment of the near future...

Who would have thought that a relatively unknown Austrian body-builder would
become an actor and sear "I\'ll be back!" in the American consciousness?

Who could have predicted the Tamagotchi/Virtual Pet explosion in Japan and the
U.S.?

Who could have predicted any one of the many hyper-bizarre Japanese game
shows?

Who would have predicted that designer blue jeans would be so damn popular in
Soviet bloc countries?

	The Air Force promised it would provide the same support with F16s, and
trotted out statistics showing that, on the range, an F16 at 300kts had the
same accuracy as an A10 at 300kts.  What they ignored was the fact that as
soon as somebody started shooting at said F16 pilot (lacking the titanium
crew compartment of the A10), he\'d crank it up to about 600kts, and
accuracy would go all to hell....

Certification:  the easy way to deal with it is to say that any character
who reaches a certain skill level is certified.  If the Imperium has a
professional society that confers significant benefits (on a magnitude
like the TAS) then membership might be more exclusive and difficult to
obtain (like the TAS).  High skill level be a prerequisite to this.  I
make this suggestion because the table lacks benefits approaching the
value of starship ownership and TAS membership.

Benefits might include easy access to Society resources, including massive
volumes of technical data that is restricted from general distribution,
perhaps through the AAB or the Society\'s own branch libraries.  Better
access to University personnel and resources than the general public.  An
easier time getting military clearance for technical areas (already know
it all anyway, and you\'re obviously vested).  Easier access to Ancient
sites, maybe (can\'t forget that one!).  A generally easier time getting
published in Society publications, which probably comprise the majority of
all academic technical publications in the Imperium.  Ability to sponsor a
non-member.

Any ideas on a name for this Society?  Kind of like a modern engineering
society with a much larger mandate, teeth, and a dose of elitism.

Any other ideas for Society benefits?  No hostels.  It should cost a lot
and suffer from the blackball problem, too.  Maybe gives a bonus against
the TAS blackball (and vice versa). 

Other ideas?

Thanks again for the new career, Paolo!

Naw, no reason to really model the hull unless I want an accurate visual
image of it.  The net effect of modeling the hull is to increase surface
area without changing the interior volume, which I can do to any extent I
like simply by adding material (a scalar quantity) to the hull on my
spreadsheet.  The scalar results are identical (all formulas in FFS are
based on scalars, IIRC) to the scalar results of modeling.  It\'s just that
linear relationship between volume and surface area requirements that does
it in.  Since surface area is logarithmic, the surface area requirements
for various components should be logarithmic, too, even if modern science
says not.  Else we can\'t even build a 500kdt battleship; and forget about
the Sylea or stuff from movies.

(Honestly, I\'m still using MT.)

There just seems to be some disagreement on the list over this.  I think I
said this all before, though.  Got ignored.  Oh well.  Such is the life of
a lurker.  :)

Yep, it was for NASP, on which I had a friend working.  It failed and
is now a dead project.  That technology doesn\'t yet exist (meaning
engines, slushtech, aeroframe, etc...)  Its at least a TL away from
us.

I\'m sure you can guess how I\'m voting. Rob, Metator is bloody great even as
it stands - if only I could save all the outputs to text files, at present
implemented only for the System Data. Without this ability, I can\'t really
use it - not the way I\'d like to, anyway.

I\'m in one of my local game stores the other day, and I notice that 
they are not carrying much in the way of T4 stuff.

I haven\'t played my campaign in a while (having putting it on hold 
for my film), so I haven\'t been to the game store since last October. 
 It\'s been a good while, and I just wanted to get a taste of what\'s 
come out since then.

So, I see that the T4 stuff is pretty thin, and I\'m thinking, "Well, 
just like when I left it, T4 sales are pretty slow.  The game store 
is not stocking T4 items."

But (and this is a big BUT), I talk with the store clerk before I 
leave, and I ask him about Traveller.

How\'s it doing?

"Well,"  he says, "it\'s one of our most rapidily growing games.  It\'s 
really picking up, and the reason we don\'t have any right now is 
because we\'ve sold most of it.  We\'ve got some more coming in next 
week."

Damn!

Did you hear that?

I think that\'s great.  It\'s the first time since T4 has come out that 
I\'ve received a good report on the game from a game store clerk.

I guess it just needed some time to catch on...

I\'m really looking forward to seeing Marc\'s T4.1.  That will probably 
be the thing that breaks down all the barriers and gets me back into 
my campaign again.

(Actually, I\'m going to get my script written first, then I plan on 
picking up my campaign--but, I\'d like to pick up with Marc\'s new 
rules.)

I haven\'t posted to the TML in who knows how long, but upon receiving 
this news from my local store, I just had to report to the list.

It\'s exciting.

I\'m glad.

I ran across a bunch of TL 12 and 13 Marines. I know that projects
about Marine history and TO&E\'s are out there, and I was wondering
if any ideas had been formed about how this fit IM or IN doctrine,
or what had changed since 1002.

  As all other units seem to be limited to TL 14, presumably all
~max. TL Marines were serving with fleet elements continuing the
offensive beyond Sol system. So it would appear that at least
until then that the IM had independent Marine regiments (from the
counters) of lower (12/13) TL for occupation or follow-up duties.

  This assumes that the white Imperial counters with a star for ID

I don\'t think you have to worry about Mickey-D\'s. It\'ll take more than the
French to knock them off.

  Not in those words, as such, but I\'m sure that a bunch of people
on the list are familiar with them. The problem is similar to the
occasional burst of Army-ese "death by acronym", or science-speak,
or, well, German, for example.

  Besides, the Trav universe is scary enough just thinking of all
the different models of TL 6 firearms out there somewhere, without
worrying about the genuine accuracy of the economic models. Self-
consistency takes enough work as it is.

  I\'m pretty sure that the USAAF was involved too. As far as being at
the Sov request (quite aside from their East German satellite later
making a great deal of noise about the inhumanity of it all), I would
like to see a source for that, as the Americans at least would\'ve been
really disinterested in co-operating after the appalling lack of Soviet
help with respect to the Warsaw Rising. Forgetting the Poles, US aviators
were running greater risks because of Soviet refusal to materially aid
bombing runs.

  ObTrav - the Imperium probably never seriously considered punitive
attacks on Terran civ targets in 1001-2. Was this due to the political
objectives they had in mind, or because the 3I didn\'t really have the
culturally Vilani mind-set wrt warfare that DGP attributed.

Well, if you\'re doing high speed runs through a GG atmosphere you\'d want to
have a tank to process the unrefined stuff you\'re taking in before pumping
it into the fuel tanks. OTOH, I\'d prefer a less violent form of
refueling...;->

That\'s pretty much the way it should work, I would think.

Actually, I don\'t see where the rules don\'t support a slower refueling
approach (not that rules bother me much ;-).  Sure FFS2 "requires"
hypersonic streamlining, but I\'ve decided you only need that kind of
streamlining if you *don\'t* have CG on your ship.  If you do have CG, you
can float along like your whale or stately Zepplin, and that\'s the method
I\'d prefer.

I did a little browsing and found that Sabotage was listed in the 1910
Webster\'s Dictionary so it predates the second *and* first world war.  I
remember reading the story about the French luddites using their wooden
sabots to block the gears of mechanical looms, but those could have been as
mythical as our "pregnate with a bullet" camp follower.  The story sounds
good though. ;->

IMO a lot of low TL cultures equipment and knowledge will be more like cold
war Soviet stuff than modern western equipment. It\'ll be bigger and need
more maintenence than higher TL gear, but it won\'t always be much less
effective. Try an AK-47 - not very advanced materials, sights, etc, but it
does the trick. Likewise Soviet SAMs.

Not after they beat the stew out of a few of the "majors". ;->

The major vs minor thing is mainly propaganda anyway, IMO. Quite a few of
us suspect none of the "major" races independently invented the jump drive.
I know what the canon *says*, but what\'s the truth behind the truth? Are
the major races just better at hiding the fact they found JD\'s and copied
them? Were they so good at hiding the fact that they *now* believe their
own propaganda?  Do the Templars know the truth? ;-p

No, no! What I\'m remembering was earlier than that. There was a concept
piece in AW&ST back in the early 80\'s, pre NASP, it was for an advance
rocket design that went no further than concept. In fact, it might have
been a letter to the editor rather than an article. 

>It failed and is now a dead project.  

It meaning NASP? I wouldn\'t say it failed, just that the funding wasn\'t
continued. There have been a number of projects that have had their funding
cut that could have succeeded. 

Based on experiments around the world, I\'d say the technologies *exist* to
build spaceplanes. The business and political will isn\'t there to do
it...at the moment. 

All IMO, of course,

It\'s actually a lot worse than that.

In the real world, "supply" and "demand" arent really curves either. Often,
they are points, or backward bending or weird stuff like that. You also
have the problem of goods that people buy *because* they are expensive (or
people using price as a proxy for quality). You also have advertising and
similar techniques that are used to move the "demand curve" itself.

Then you have the screaming insane mess that happens to micro-economic
theory when you drop the assumption of costless information (how much is
your dog worth ? Answer : How much will someone pay me for it ? Second
question : How much would it cost me to find out how much someone will pay
you for your dog. Second answer : We can\'t know, we can only guess).

So we deal with the problem by using some numbers as proxies (ie
infrastructure, culture etc) and look the other way when people point out
things like the non-fungibility of different types of capital, or the
possibilities of capital reswitching, or where does this number of 3% for
the Imperial Rate of Interest come from, anyway ?

I figure is useful mostly for second jump fuel storage. Say you have a J-1
ship with an extra J-1 fuel stored inside the armour etc. It is a very good
thing this requirement that j-fuel has to be gobbled-up-able in a short
time as this leaves out the much more problematic (from a canon standpoint
if you can grasp such a concept ;-) idea of using water as hydrogen
storage.

Either go hogwild and perhaps lose some of the audience or just borrow
slang, phrases from today and Travellerify them. The only thing important
is to THINK about what you write. Look at the stuff from DGP, the interview

Of course.  I\'m sorry Froggie, but well our Whole Atlantic fleet had a

A discarding sabot round has a smaller calibre round inside a sleeve
that drops away when fired. This increased the velocity of the smaller
projectile, increasing the penetration and range of it.

I guess that\'s for the sleeve when it drops away after leaving the
muzzle.

	Well, I am a mathematician, but I\'ve been working in Economics 
Faculties (as Assistant Prof.) for some years now, and my advice will 
be... do not pay any attention. We do not really have any idea 
whether the demand an supply functions exist at all, let alone 
whether they are curves, lines or fractal boundaries of some 
non-measurable set. And, besides, there is strong evidence that all 
of them are very sensitive to specification details: in other words, 
even if we had a complete theory (which we do not have) specifying an 
isoleastic demand function for the whole Earth, this would not need 
to be the case in other worlds, and, of course, this would not 
necessarily have any meaning in the framework of an interstellar 
economy. So... use whatever you thing sound reasonable in your 
universe, and forget Economic Theory. Besides, if you think 
contemporary terran Economic Theory would be fun in your universe, 
try (as introduction) Burda-Wyploscz, Macroeconomics: A European 
Text, by Oxford University Press. It treats international open 
economies, which could arguably be thought to be analogous to 
interstellar economics.

As far as I know, it ghoes back to the *early* days of the industrial
revolution. The workers sabotaged the machines as part of a ""machinery
is evil" campaign. So it probably dates back to the 1700s.

If I\'ve been "exposed" to the info, I usually retain the gist of it.
Hand on tests, and for driving the person(s) on the other side of the
ref screen *nuts*.

But it\'s hardly frightening. The contents of my "toy bag" and my
"armory" now *that* is frightening. 

Seriously,  happen to have been exposed to entirely too much Dean
Martin because my mother liked his TV show. I\'ve seen some of the
Martin and Lewis movies when I was younger and I wasn\'t impressed. 

I find "Matt helm" (Dean Martin trying to be a secret agent) somewhat
watchable because it is *so* silly. But I much prefer Coburn\'s "Flint"
movies.

And yes, I do like MAD magazine. :-)

You are mistaken about Occams razor. If you cannot prove wether God exists
or not you apply the Occams razor and choose the theory that postulates the
least amount of unmeasureable data.
Bye bye god-theory no matter how comforting it may seem. We can take this
to e-mail if you like but I know it is meaningless. Religious people aren\'t
religious because that\'s the best theory for the given data but rather they
have FAITH. All I said was that atheists should not be constructed as
having a faith as they could be using scientific methods in everyday life.
I\'m not saying that you should use scientific methods all the time just
that if you do, you\'re forced to choose the non-god theory unless you have
been subject to measureable, repeatable miracles unexplainable by science.

I use the random cultural quirks tables in WBH a lot when my group go
someplace unexpected. Then I just invent some details regarding this quirk
during play and afterwards I try to come up with a rational justification
which, surprisingly, generally goes more or less automatically.

I think that Imperial culture is important, esp subculture, because those
things the players can learn and use and this makes them more embedded in
the Imperium. The hardest part for me as a ref is making the players feel
they\'re Imperials too. Most NPCs knows more about the goings of the
industry, economy, philosophy, fashion etc than the players so sometime
they feel like tourists in a foreign country despite them being just as
Imperial as the NPCs.

My current campaign has been going on for 6 years realtime and my major
player still feels alienated from time to time. How do the other refs
handle this?

Have you checked with Marc regarding the copyright/trademark issues?  I
think there are a lot of legal loopholes that will have to be navigated
here.  You might also have to clear it with MPG-Net, though I suspect that
they will just want come credit for running the list as well as a pointer

Stealth Suit;  This one piece footed garment comes with a facemask and air
filter.  Together, every part of the human body is covered.  The fabric has
the following qualities.  It is fiber encapsulated so that no clothing
fibers will \'fall off\' the garment.  this also keeps skin, sweat, and hair
from the wearer from being left behind.  With mask and respirator this
applies to the face as well.

The fabric is manufactured to prevent unwanted noise - it is smooth to
preven "rubbing noise", and cushioned to supress other noises.  The fabric
is generally flat black, and is non-reflective.  At high tech levels
(TL14+) a chameleon option is possible.  At TL14 it merely matches the
general pattern of the background, at TL15 it will exactly replicate the
pattern and appearance of the nearest surface (this can be quite fun at
parties).

Hood, mask and respirator are intended to prevent physical evidence from
being left at the scene of any activity the user may wish to undertake
which could then be DNA matched.  It also allows communication without any
outside noises occuring.  Sounds of excessive respiration will also be
supressed.

The feet have a thin non-skid pad on the bottom.  Footwear can be worn over
this, and in fact feet are not very well shod in the garment.

If stealth skill is used, a bonus of +1 per tech level above 8 against
unaugmented humans can be applied to all associated task rolls (adjust per
the situation).  If used against electronic surveillance, use the
difference in TL as the modifier; If the TL of the surveillence equipment
is higher than the suit\'s tech level there is a good (50%?) chance that the
equipment is specifically designed to be able to detect this sort of
intrusion.

Those without stealth skill or its equivalent must roll less than INT on 2D
to properly handle and don the outfit.  Failure will merely invalidate the
DNA-trace related capabilities.

This item is illegal on many worlds.

Stealth Suit, Cost Cr. 45,000 (+2500 x TL over 9), Wt. 1Kg, TL 9 to 15


Mem-X Drug;  Human and Human-like brains hold memories in chemical storage
for about 1 to 4 minutes before transferring them to long term memory.  A
drug has been developed to disrupt that short term storage scheme,
fragmenting and thereby erasing the memories encoded in the chemical matrix.

This drug is generally illegal, its effects and side effects are somewhat
unpredictable, but in most people it will erase 1 to 4 minutes of memory
(use 2d4 times 30 seconds if available, giving a bias to the 2 1/2 minute
point) and cause and equal amount of unconciousness.

Note that the affected person will awake, disoriented, and will wonder why
they were asleep.  No posthypnotic or other sorts of suggestions are
possible with this drug, nor can long term memory be affected, since this
uses a completely different storage scheme.

When available, the drug is in standard Dermospray capsules (dermospray
injections do not break the skin.  A doctor can find a dermospray injection
point with minor instruments, but its not a routine exam).  One capsule is
one adult dose.  When applied, a difficult roll against medical skill is
made; on catastrophic failure the person is allergic and goes into
anaphylectic (sp?) shock.  If the opportunity is available to examine a
person\'s (TL9+) medical record this sensitivity can be determined
beforehand (I gotta think of these things when I\'m playing with Jo Grant!).

Mem-X Drug, Cost Cr. 1000/dose (+500 per Law Level over 5), Wt. Neg., TL 11


Whisperer;  An electronic device, the size of a fountain pen, which allows
the passing of verbal messages to an unaugmented person.  Range is about 25
meters, and is line-of-sight only.  The device uses a low power laser to
keep sound waves within a certain tight dispersion pattern.  The beam is
undetectable, except when in a direct path in front of or behind the target
(it will set off laser sensors within this path).  At 25m the terminal end
of the beam is about 1m across; at that range getting someone else (an
unintended recipient) in the "pickup" range is more likely.

When using the device, the bearer must make a "to hit" roll as though they
were trying to shoot the intended recipient with a pistol (treat unskilled
users as having zero-level skill if they had any chance to practice at
all).  Failure indicates the recipient didn\'t hear the message and another
attempt must be made (one combat round per attempt), a catastrophic failure
indicates that someone else has heard the message (someone adjacent to the
intended recipient or who walked into the beam between the transmitter and
te recipient).  The intended recipient may still have gotten the message,
roll d6 and on a 1-3 the message got through.

Frequently, this device is used in combination with a heads-up display
which can automatically show the device\'s area of effect as a red shading,
if so, give the  "shooter" a DM of +4 (make the roll 4 pips easier).  As
always, a maximum roll is a catastrophic failure.

Note that the device is one-way only.  A seperate device would be needed
for the user to receive any message back from the recipient.  The device
has a built in microphone, but with a compatible multiplexing communicator
the user can transmit via commdots, mastoid-implant, or forward a
communication she/he receives.

This device is not generally illegal; it is often used by important people
who need to be kept up to date, but are expected to undertake social
activities like mixing at parties or other events, and is sometimes used by
security and enforcement authorities to quietly evacuate a room.  The
effects of the device are distinctive, and anyone receiving a message of
this sort can tell its not a person next to them, and will know the method
of transmission if they\'ve ever heard it before (or go to spy flicks).  The
recipient cannot tell where the message is coming from if the user takes
steps to conceal his or her location.

Whisperer, Cr. 500, Wt. Neg., TL 10

When the bladder is full, you can then initiate jump with the <handwave

the H2 is used, so you can jump based on your normal displacement size.

The extra storage density would need to be a significant benefit (I 
don\'t think the +50% associated with water or ammonia storage would

Mind you, I\'m not sure what kind of bladder material will remain 
flexible at 4 Kelvin - any of you NASA space techs know?

I have not seen any recent articles, but the older hydrogen absorbtion 
methods proposed for H2-gas powered cars only claimed that you could 
store more H2 in your cars fuel tank using activated carbon / titanium 
/ zeolite than you could in the empty tank alone ... but that is 
because of the relatively modest pressure used to store the H2 gas in 
the fuel tank.

I\'m not sure this is  right.  Travellers  to  the  frontier  from
Paris/London/Washington would have been basically out of  contact
while  travelling.   Ditto  on  the  return  journey  leading  to
cultural "jet-lag".  In  TRAVELLER  a  journey  to  the  Spinward
Marches from Core would not be done in isolation (there are  many
stops along the way).  So  you  would  get  a  sort  of  cultural
"doppler effect" ... fashions appearing to hardly change  at  all
on the outward journey, resuming normal  speed  of  change  while
staying over, and appearing  to  change  rapidly  on  the  return
journey.  Thus your trendy Core noble would be saved a fate worse
than death.

Of course this assumes that the frontier regions try to ape  Core
fashions ... I think there are enough  cultural  centres  \'behind
the claw\' that Deneb and  the  Spinward  Marches  would  tend  to
develop their own galactic cultural  styles.  Perhaps  a  problem
for the Imperium is that this cultural fragmentation can lead  to
political break-away tendencies.  Hmmm ... I see a new branch  of
the Imperial beaucracy: the Fashion Police!  :-^

It\'s too bad the Marines didn\'t say the same thing about the A-6. When

    'body' => 'Someone recently wrote to me concerning an essay I had started speculating
on the religion of the Kif race in C.J. Cherryh\'s compact novels. Although
technically off topic, given the recent discussion here in the use of
Religion
in role-playing games I thought it might be of interest to people...

[From the Cherryhlist:]

Someone\'s comment about sending missionaries to the Kif got my mind
turning.
Do the Kif have religion? What would it be like. Anyway, having thought and
discussed it I\'m presented my ideas in the form of a letter from a mythical
missionary to our favourite Kif from Chanur\'s Legacy. Part I covers Kiffish
religion and Part II (Wednsday?) is the apostolic bit, i.e. trying to make
Christianity appealing to a kiffish mindset. Comments encouraged and
welcomed...

Honor to you Vikktakkht an Nikkatu, Hakkikt Hakkiktun, Ambassador to the
Compact. Two years ago I came to you to be your skkukuk and you have shown
me
great honour in that time. You have directed your skku to answer my
questions
and listened carefully to what I have said about the human compact. This
time I
write to you of what I have learned of the kiffish religion and to say more
 on
the human religion and how, if the hakkikt considers it wise enough, the
hakkit
may prosper through it.
  In the early time of Kiffish society, when they were still worldbound,
the Kif
were, similar as they are now, a scoeity lead by strong hakts gathering
skku and
skkukuk beneath them. Gaining sfik through eating their enemies hearts and
becoming hakkikts. A hakkits sfik was measured by his power to destroy.
Sfik was
gained through destroying a powerful enemy. Sfik was gained by sacrificing
a
treasured item or valuable ally, thus showing the hakkikt has enough sfik
to
stand on his own without the sfik gained from these.
  Yet these hakkikts were not all powerful. Plagues, floods, and other
natural
disasters could wipe out vast amounts that no hakkikt could ever aspire to.
 Thus
they reasoned the hakkikts that had the ability to use these for their own
purposes must be great indeed. They considered them supernatural to the
world
and named them mekt-hakkikt.
  A hakkikt who was vassal to a mekt-hakkikt share in the sfik of that
mekt-hakkikt. If a natural disaster struk an enemy then it was the
mekt-hakkikt
showing its power against the rival. If a natural disaster struck at a
vassal of
a mekt-hakkikt then the deity was showing that it had enough sfik to stand
alone
without the aid of that vassal.
  Before this time the largest unit of social organisation was a hakkikt
and
what they could control through threat of destruction. As there was only so
 much
a Kif of the time could do with the weapons available the maximum area of
transient stability was small, leaving little time to improve their
weapons.
With the advent of mekt-hakkikts, hakkikts who were vassal to the same
mekt-hakkikt had a social convention whereby they could cooperate with
another
hakkikt without losing sfik. Now, of course, this was not always the case
and
frequently one hakkikt might disagree with another as to just what the
mekt-hakkikt intended. In this instance one groups split off from the other
proclaiming their mekt-hakkikt supreme and starting a war between rival
mekt-hakkikts through their hakkikts. Thus the deities of the Kif rise and
fall
according to their sfik the same as their vassals. However, in the interrum
times the areas under control of a single mekt-hakkikt were larger and
lasted
longer than under just hakkikts. The greater the transient stability the
more
free time there is for the hakkikts to develop their weapons and other
advances.
  Eventually their weapons developed to the point where they rivaled the
power
of natrual disasters at devestation. Hakkikts arose proclaiming that they
had
killed their mekt-hakkikts and now wielded powers greater than that.
Indeed, as
the Kif moved out into space they moved into an environment where there
were no
natural disasters, only Kif-made ones. In space a hakkikt could only fall
through the actions of another kif. The mekt-hakkikts all died or were
supplanted. It is only in recent times that there have arisen Kif powerful
enough to claim the title of Mekt-hakkikt.

[More recent mail:]
  Sorry, I never actually got around to this. I still have the ideas. It
may get done someday. The basic idea was introducing the idea of gaining
sfik
through personal self-sacrifice. Basically by denying worldly pleasures
(for
example) showed your strength and thus gained sfik. Or through doing
charitable
acts, ie expending energies where, stictly speaking, you wouldn\'t have to,
also
shows your stature and gains you sfik.
  Jesus (and I had Kif-ised the name as well, something like Kikus) gained
the
ultimate sfik by, first of all, by leading the perfect life. He defied
superiors,
and slapped the face of traditional spiritual authority. He gained a
following
and, although possessed of ultimate divine power, let himself be captured
and
killed by his enemies. However, this was not the final failing of an
otherwise
successful kif, but rather the crowning sfik-gaining act (there must be a
kif
noun for that!) of his career. For his followers did not knuckle under to
the
authorities, or split up, or fall to infighting, they recognised that he
had
ascended and gained great spirtual sfik and continued to worship and
proclaim
him (whatever the kif verb is for follow-the-leader). Even the one who
backstabbed him saw his failing and killed himself (to a kiffish mindset
this
is perhaps the ultimate argument of Jesus\'s post-life sfik).
  So, the missionaries slant is that kif who want to follow a really great
leader, should follow Kikus, since he is above challange and passes on sfik
 to
those who serve him well.
  An adaption of the parable of the coin (Render unto Ceaser that which is
Caeser\'s. Render unto God, that which is God\'s) allows for a split between
earthly devotion and spiritual devotion. You might follow a great temporal
leader with your body, to gain earthly sfik, but should follow a great
spiritual leader with your soul to gain divine sfik and thus gain a high
place
in his followers when you die.

     Given the recent discussion of entertainers, I thought I\'d dump on the
list the introduction for a Milieu-0 adventure I started writing (in Memory
of Metlay, who left the TML to become a rock-star :-). It isn\'t complete,
and given the arse-wise policy of IG in not paying its writiers I doubt it
will ever see professional publication. I may finish it as an amateur
supplement for CORE. But don\'t hold your breath...

                          Concert of the Century




                             Jo & Lesley Grant
                               December 1997
  This  booklet is an extended Milieu-0 adventure which pits the characters
as  veteran  combatants  on the leading edge of the Cultural Imperialism of
Cleon?s Empire.


Introduction

  Milieu-0  is  a  time  of  chance  and  excitement. The Zhanasusitu trade
consortium  had developed the key to constructive uplifting of the Outback.
Through  their  success  Sylea had prospered to the point where Cleon could
justifiably take the throne.
  The  first  wave beyond the fringe are the Scouts. They chart and map and
work  out  what  cultures are suitable for uplift into trading partners and
where the resources are.
  The second wave into the fringe are the developers. These take the worlds
through  contact,  engineer  their  governments  and lay the groundwork for
industry.
  Then  it  is  the  turn  of the merchants. They set up workhouses and get
their  economy  going.  Industry,  manufacturing  and  goods production are
brought  up  to  the  level  where  they can then begin to afford to import
Imperial goods.
  Now  they  are  almost  ready  to  be  welcomed into the Imperium. Having
learned  to  work  like  good Imperial citizens, it is now time for them to
think  and  desire  goods  like  good Imperial citizens. It is time for the
cultural Imperialists.
  Advertisers,  promoters,  tour  agencies, snake-oil sales reps, etc. Line
them  up  and  send  them in. Bombard the bastards with rotating billboards
advertising  mood  rings  to enchant them. Trashy romance novels set in the
days  of  the  Rule  of  Man  to  give  them  that feeling of being part of
something  larger.  And  fashion,  hairstyles,  ornament, and cosmetics far
superior  to  the  animal  skins,  tin  trinkets,  and soot they had, until
recently donned.
  But all this is just skirmishing. Small exchange of fire a bigger war. On
the  tip  of  trendy,  at the height of hysteria, it is time to unleash the
Valkiries  of  Vogue,  let loose the Dogs of More, a Panzerblitz of Popular
Culture.
  It is time for Plutonium Rock.

    My campaign has never had an elemnt of starship combat. This all changed
last night and the results were very poor. I feel there is something wrong.
I\'m using MT and the fight took place between a far trader and an armed
ships boat. These two ships are as presented in the MT Imperial
Encyclopaedia. The only change is that both ships have grade 1 beam lasers
and the far trader has a grade 1 sand caster. The sensor tasks were
reasonable, once we checked the errata sheet. The weapon hit task almost
always failed and when it didn\'t, the sandcaster almost always prevents
effective penetration. The far trader could never hit the ships boat under
any circumstance, there was no dice roll that could possibly have landed a
hit. With a task difficulty of Dif, all that was needed was a DM result on
the confrontation task of >+2 to make the opponent invincible. The ships
boat vs. the far trader had a DM result of +5. The far trader could never
land a hit. Seems to me that the pirates of the spinward marches must prey
on far traders with nothing more than a ship\'s boat. This has to be wrong.
    I need to fix this, or MT starship combat is an utter waste of time and
this, I beleive, is not the case with the other members of the TML.

    Thanks in advance.

I did a search on the web for this, and what I turned up was really rather

shoes through the ages, and in a passing comment, the woman who organized the
show stated that there were a number of things about shoes that most people
didn\'t know, including the origins of the word sabotage.  According to her, it
had come from the practice of stomping on crops to ruin them...

Well, there are the Aslan, who canon says did not discover jump on their own.
Then there\'s the Vilani, who I\'ve always suspected since their interstellar
culture came so quickly after the war robots ran down.
The Solomani as far as I know, discovered it on their own (unless, of course,
that was a Vilani scout craft that crashed at Roswell!)  ;^)
The Hivers probably did discover jump on their own, since they had a wildly
imperfect version at first.
The Vargr...  Well, one never knows with the Vargr.
I\'m not sure about the K\'Kree, but I looked at a unified timeline last night,
and their race is extremely old, so they had plenty of time to do it on their
own if they did.

I\'m new to the list but I\'ve got some questions regarding trade
classifications in TNE (MT too).

In the sale price of cargo table, the column for Ice Capped (Ic) worlds
seems to be missing. The text describing Ice Capped worlds indicates
that they are poor markets.  Does that mean that they universally have a
- -1?

In a slightly related note... Since Barren (Ba) worlds have 0 population
wouldn\'t they all be Low Population (Lo) worlds (pop 4-). And if this is
true, should the Lo classification be ignored as the Va classification
is ignored on As worlds?

Thanks in advance

Ooops forgot again to mention that I REALLY liked your stuff.
Especially as you have written it without ref notes etc inside the text.
Great to prop up in Quark and give the players as handout. Too much talk of
penetration values, jumpdrive tech and too little about stuff like "What
colours to choose when buying this years Rashush", "Are Vargr really better
as cosmetists than humans", "How old can you be and still wear a Starman
Jones T-shirt in public" etc. Culture.

Well, in the real American west, there was still a big trade in fashion,
especially out in California.  I would think that Spinward Marches Imperials
would undoubtedly try to ape their Core counterparts, especially nobles.  The
way I see the nobles in Traveller is as a very cutthroat group that are _very_
status oriented.

That\'s not to say that everybody in the Spinward Marches attempts to be a Core
fashion-plate, just as most western folk didn\'t dress up in the latest Paris
and New York fashions...

But the desire was still there among those who could afford them.  Eventually
the American west created its own fashions, using its own materials, and
eventually the non-fashionable pratical outfits became a fashionable style in
and of themselves (much later).

My vote is for Metator, big time.  Andy Akin\'s FFS spreadsheet is great for
ship building, and I don\'t see the point in duplicating his effort, really.
A solar system and world builder that allows customization and tinkering

NASP probably should be considered a failure, but not because of slush
hydrogen but because of the engines - scramjets with useful performance
regimes turn out to be much harder than anyone thought. Slush hydrogen is
still being pursued, although the advantages are pretty marginal (about 10%
higher density, I think) and the difficulties severe (getting the fuel out of
the tanks at the right rate is hard.)

Spaceplanes with airbreathing engines seem unlikely (to me, though some
would disagree.) Fully-resuable single-stage-to-orbit vehicles seem 
fairly likely, though - NASA is pretty serious about X-33, LockMart is 
interested in VentureStar (it\'s successor) and there are a lot of 
neat, weird concepts for small SSTOs being pursued by small companies
(ranging in weirdness from aerially-refuelled peroxide-burning spaceplanes,
to towed-launch spaceplanes, to orbital helicopters...)

No.  Not.  The only way I would accept this is a world where the local

Actually, one of the players in my last campaign did a pretty extensive
write up on the circumstances of his childhood, added a great deal of depth
to his character.

For those truly interested in the life path style, I recommend Paul
Jayquay\'s Central Casting books.  Some of the beackrounds are a little odd,
bt they make for interesting characters.  Be warned, in the first editions
Paul\'s personel religious beliefs are all over the place (homosexuality is
an evil trait) so look for the second editions.

To get an idea on how a resource handling starports should look like, I\'d
recommend Star Wars\' "Platt\'s Starport Guide"-- but only if you can pick it
up for cheap.

I like the idea of this one (somebody\'s been watching _Men In Black_:), but
I have a problem with the handwaved explanation. The exact process behind
memory encoding is not yet known, but it almost certainly isn\'t in the form
of a "chemical matrix". This seems to be a hold-over from a now-disproven
late-Sixties notion of RNA memory storage. Larry Niven popularized the
concept in SF, where it still crops up all too often, but it is definitely
not true. Certainly, there are lots of chemicals involved in neural
impulses, but this does not mean memories are encoded chemically.

Current theory is that short-term memories are encoded in impulses cycling
through neural pathways. The memory circuits for fact memories and skill
memories are different. In one possible circuit for fact memory,
"information received by the sensory regions of the cerebral cortex is
relayed by the amygdala and hippocampus to the diencephalon (thalamus and
hypothalamus), which in turn transmits impulses to forebrain regions called
the prefrontal cortex and basal forebrain. Using multiple neural
connections with the sensory cortex, the basal forebrain completes the
memory circuit by transmitting impulses to the same sensory region that
first perceived the sensory input." (Biology, 2nd ed, Neil A. Campbell,
1990, page 1006.)

The theory goes that, with each cycle, the cortical neurons are \'trained\',
altered in some manner which enhances their tendencies to repeat the same
pattern of firing in the future. The actual mechanism of memory
consolidation is still under investigation - I\'d be interested if anyone on
the list has more recent information on this.

Anyway, Mem-X drug can still be made to work, with a different handwave. It
would be a molecule designed to interfere with the chemical changes in the
dendrites which cause memory consolidation. According to one theory, neural
input causes a postsynaptic cell to take up calcium; the calcium activates
enzymes that alter the cytoskeleton, changing the structure of the dendrite
in such a way that future transmission across that synapse is enhanced. If
this theory is true, I think Mem-X would have to bind with these
memory-consolidation enzymes, to prevent their activation by calcium.
Messing with the uptake of calcium would probably be a Bad Idea, as it
would have an effect on lots more than just memory in the brain, but the
whole nervous system as well.

It wouldn\'t even need to cause unconsciousness. There\'s a neurological
disorder called "Korsakov\'s Syndrome" in which a person has no long-term
memory consolidation. They can remember new things for perhaps ten or
fifteen minutes, but then forget completely. This can happen while they\'re
wide awake and talking to you; they seem perfectly normal until they ask
you, for the third time, who you are. In effect, Mem-X would induce a form
of short-term Korsakov\'s. (William Gibson had a character in _Mona Lisa
Overdrive_ who had been given a permanent case of Induced Korsakov\'s,
IIRC.)

Hmmm. I should go to the library and track down more current information on
memory consolidation. I suspect there could well be lots of drugs already
known to have the same effect as Mem-X. Alcohol, for instance...

Indeed!  The Sayat believe that the only way to cure spandex infestations
is by brisk application of extremely high electrical voltages.  Usually
fatal, but anything is preferable to slowly being "absorbed" by this
hideous bioweapon, obviously left behind by the evil, cunning Ancients and
still propagated by the Droyne and various spineless puppet minions (e.g.,
the Templars, the Zhodani Consulate, the Travellers\' Aid Society, Mothers
Against Grav Cycle Carnage, etc.).

Spofulam-designed and manufactured spandex treatment facilities will be
brought to every planet in the (former) Imperium by approximately 1210 T.I.

Yup.  There\'s a REASON why Sayat distrust slug-firing small arms.
(Besides, some of their best friends are slugs.)

Walking past a yuppie kitchen supply boutique a week or two ago, I spotted
a Sayat "baby blaster" cleverly disguised as a very snazzy black-trimmed
chrome turkey baster.  I\'m still not sure whether to snicker, ogle, or

 I find the standard Traveller world generation system essentially unusable
for my games.

Mac version - this could be handy, though we should likely talk about just
how to do it, as this covers a lot of ground, not all of which passes the
smoke test in standard Traveller rules.  Further, many of the same issues
about how to generate uwps get in here.  Rate this one below Metator updates.

This one would be very useful to me, as I have not yet gotten Andrew\'s

The players just finished a scenario where they got to meet one of the many
Darrians scattered about Core in early M0 by a catastrohpic misjump.  Said
Darrian was running primarily TL 17-18 equipment, and playing God.

Psionics are pretty easy to turn into this.  I make Psionics the core of
the TL 20-22 band of technology.  Teleportation and antimatter were the
keys to 17-19.  15-16 were ruled by disintegrators, black globes, and
massive increases in fusion power, while 12-14 were the domain of meson
weapons.  9-11 were ruled by cheap antigrav, fusion, and jump drive, while
6-8 were ruled by computers, mass production, and the dramatic rise of the
leisure class.

Yeah.  All the major powers also "just happen" to be major races...
I suspect that if this was seriously challenged the definition
would be changed so it still included all the major powers
or it would fade into a minor bragging point.  ("We devoloped

Valid points, I also had problems with the MT space combat section,

MT, and this one part let it down for me. Hence, in steps the solution...
IMAGINATION!. I allowed Gunnery Combat as a DM on the to hit rolls,
and made other modifications as they came along. Then I found the 
absolutely excellent Role Playing Space Combat System (all praise
be to it!). I was liberated from the drudgery of a complicated system
where player characters were forgotten and wargaming methods arose.
Now I Role Play ship to ship combat, forget all the rules, and have FUN.

My players know now, that if it\'s good for the plot, they get hit or score
a critical hit on the enemy just in the \'nick of time\' and we enjoy every
minute of it.

I don\'t know if people really appreciate who fragile short term memory is.
I\'ve recently started having seizures again, and one of the joyful side
effects is the total destrcution of short term memory.

How bad is it?  I can forget that I\'ve eaten, or started the shower, or put
the phone down in the space of seconds.

Anything that modifies human memory needs to be handled carefully.

I pretty much like to stick to canon, as it is interpreted, but this is an
application of reasonably available technology of the time, not an
invention of (much) new technology.

The attempt was to stop well short of an "invisibility suit".  A sucessful
stealth roll (or dex roll, if no stealth skill), in my opinion, results in
finding a good hiding place, or running between the searchlights, or making
your way down a poorly lit corridor with people at the far end who aren\'t
looking, etc.  It does not mean crossing the middle of a parade ground in
front of the Imperial Palace at Noon.

The TL15 chameleon option is the same technology as is used on high tech
battledress.  If seen from a distance and not moving, a person can lie flat
against a wall without being seen, provided the observer is pretty much
"straight out" from the wall and there are no other observers around with a
better angle.

There is also an (intentional) lack of IR masking.  In my opinion, it takes
a closed loop refrigeration system which, while possible in powered armor
with the energy and space it has available, is *not* possible in a couple
of layers of spandex.

Although I don\'t know how it\'s used for MT ships; probably isn\'t hard.

It may be a "waste", but you still have to keep track of it because vectors
in the third dimension will have a component in the other dimensions
(unless they are colinear, which is pretty unlikely).

I suppose you may be able to \'factor out\' the extra dimension, but that
would mean refiguring the acceleration based on the ships\' orientations and
angle between their acceleration vectors. You couldn\'t say a ship
"accelerates ta 2 G" because some of it would have to be factored out. Too
complicated for me.

True, but it\'ll be a pain refiguring every vector in the new reference
plane when you do that. Good point, \'tho.

But with regard to ranks, I would think that some standardized system
would be desirable and would also be a shorthand way to signify a
technician\'s level of expertise, and perhaps reflect certification,
etc.  I guess I\'m thinking of some kind of expansion upon the medievel
system of Apprentice X, Journeyman X, Master X (Where X is Smith,
Wheelwright, Mason, Wainwright, Printer, Joiner, Teamster, Cooper,
Cobbler, etc.).  Perhaps drop the craft specific appellation and throw
in other grades.

Perhaps something like this, with no officer/enlisted-type division.

Apprentice
Hand
Able Hand
Journeyman
Craftsman
Engineer
Master Engineer


BTW, how about have them be nicknamed "Tinkers"  as in the phrase "A

who travelled from place to places, fixing things, because they couldn\'t
afford to build a shop.

IIRC, the danger space is due to automatic fire effects.

Thanks for the reply.  As expected, this scrubs my scenario with TL 15

(We don\'t need to run across the Palace lawn, but we do have to penetrate

form of intrusion that I can think of.)

Just now stumbled onto this thread.  This is the only thing I will say on
TML about this subject.

1)    I am an aetheist.
2)    I have been since age 9-10.
3)    I apply Occam\'s Razor, but came to aetheism before I was aware of
it.
4)    I became an aetheist primarily due to the inability of any faith
(primarily Christianity, but Judaism, too, to adeqautely explain itself as
a plausible system, especially, that "no other gods but me" stuff - Zeus
and Thor and such always made much more sense and behaved like regular
people).
5)    This all happened at Catholic School (wonder if we need a traveller
parallel to Parochial Education ;-)
6)    You can\'t really lump aetheists together because each comes to his
belief independently, without any support from others, and usually against
the norm for their environment.
7)    Atheism to me is no God, god or gods.  There ain\'t no nothing.
Death = decomposition.  (hmm, what would standard burial rights be for
Traveller Imperium?  Burial (archaic even today), cremation, ritual
decomposition (like in an acid bath or something?), "Soylent Green is
People!"?).
8)    IMHO, Agnosticism means theres something out there, but dogmatic
systems of belief/faith/whatever are unnecessary.
9)    As far as how this aetheist gets through life:  I call it
"Enlightened Hedonism."  Start off with simple pain avoidance/pleasure
attainment, add in John Donne\'s Meditation 17 ("No man is an island"),
broaden your conception of pleasure beyond the narrow one of the flesh to
include all of humaniti, mix well with the realization of the pleasures of
delayed gratification and the happiness that comes after a hard days work,
season to taste with good-natured sarcasm, bake until golden brown.


Have fun.

  I like what I see <Grin>.  I somehow suspect T4.1 is gonna kick
posteriors <chuckle>.

  While we are on the topic of world generation...

  Maybe someone out there is conversant with what I am about to propose...

  In a few roleplaying games, there is a formula that permits a GM to
calculate the "period" of a planet as it orbits a sun.  Off hand, I don\'t
recall the formula used in TRAVELLER SCOUTS, but it will give a period
value.

  Is it possible, given the Mass of the target sun, plus the "period" of
the planet, to calculate what the mass of the planet should be?

  Also, is it possible, based on the information above, to calculate what
the density of the planet must be in order to accomodate the mass with a
specified "diameter"?

  And yet one final "question"...

  Supposedly, when using the "acretion" method of star generation, there
is a density gradient such that planets closer to a sun have a higher
density, while planets further from the sun have a lessor density.  Can
anyone come up with a reasonable "system" to simulate this?  Also, it
would seem that most of the "dust" is concentrated by volume closer
towards the sun, while further out, the "dust" would be sparser.  Dust by
the definition, is any of the more solid materials that are not gasses.

  Currently, I am using Mass of sun times 6 AU\'s as a dividing point from
where planetary "densities" start to drop rapidly from 5.5 g/cc to about
3 g/cc to plain ice balls at .9 g/cc.  This in turn will also help to
determine what the radius of planets should be based on their "mass" for
their assigned distance, etc...

 If anyone would be interested in answering my questions, I would
appreciate it greatly.

Well, I will consider now saying I\'m sorry, but well our Whole US Fleet has

Mainly in the employment and legal arenas, I think. 

For example, on a high-law-level world you would have to be a certified
mechanic to work on a vehicle; on a low-law-level world you would be
handed a wrench and told "try this one" and if you succeeded you\'d be
hired.

On a low-law-level world, if you had medical skill you could fix people.
With higher law levels you\'d need certification to try (or risk penalties).


Why do I think there should be a difference between having the skill and
certification?

Example: one of my colleagues teaches English. While in Africa he learned
how to do simple surgery. If he tries it in Canada he\'ll be in a _lot_ of
trouble (unless the situation requires immediate action and there is no
alternative - thank God for the Good Samaritan laws).

Another example: the dentist I visited while a child missed a lot of
things that would have been simpler to correct back then. he had the
certificate, but my present dentist is _lots_ more skilled.

All good.

What about predictability?  If I do X then the Battle Drone does Y.

What about messing with programing?

What about say the computer gets scrambled & attacks a civilian target?

Neither did Pascal himself. Strange that those who use Pascal\'s Wager only

What if you slewed the meson beam a little so, instead of the decay
happening on a line segment, it gets spread out over a volume. This would
make it more difficult to track backwards to the source. Also, the
\'explosion\' would occupy a spherical region in space and tend to cause more
collateral damage.

Thanks for reviving the thread.

I was convinced by the half-life argument that we should leave the meson
gun handwave alone (okay, brand me for a lazy brain :).  If we really want
to figure it out, we have to go and give TL 11 a better way to quantify
the lifetimes of particles, and that\'s a Pandora\'s Box if I ever saw one.
Undoubtedly it\'s been hacked beyond recognition by the PhDs on the TML
already. ;-)

We can make it hard or easy to locate a meson emitter by making it hard or
easy to get readings on decaying mesons.  That is, I think it\'s really a
sensor question, not a meson accelerator / decelerator question.  I think
that existing canonical information on sensors in Traveller is open enough
to let it go either way, except that it has already been specified that a
deep site is really hard to find.

Opinions?

The short answer: no.

   Normally, the masses of both objects are used to calculate the 
period.  However, because the planet\'s mass is so small compared to 
the star\'s, you can get away with using only the star\'s mass in the 
period equation.  

   To figure out the planet\'s mass from the period, you\'d have to 
have the planet\'s period and the star\'s mass (and the masses of other 
bodies in the system) measured to a high degree of accuracy.

Neither the diameter or density of the planet is not used in the 
period calculations above, so you can use whatever method you prefer 
to determine the density or diameter.  

Or is the question how to determine the density if you know the 
diameter (or radius) and mass?  If so, it would be:

   m / (4/3 * pi * r^3)

where m is the planet\'s mass and r the radius.  I\'m going by memory 
for the volume of a sphere (4/3 * pi *r^3) so double-check that.

Yeah.  I always thought the Tigress was designed by an idiot. The

Hi Clark.

Actaully, for a given solid surface area is proportional to the
square of the linear dimension and volume is proportional to the
cube.

i.e. for a sphere

	surface area = 4*(pi)*r^2

	volume = 1.33*(pi)*r^3

for a cube

	surface area = 6 * l^2

	volume = l^3

for a rectangular prism (letting b & c be constant multiples of a)

	surface area = 2(ab+bc+ac) = 2*(constant1)*a^2

	volume = abc = (constant2)*a^3

These are the actual scalings

I think that the agrument for meson beam origin point location
is avlid.  Meson decays should be fairly traceable along their
beam axis.  Even with the best nuclear level tinkering, statistically,
some mesons will decay early and some will decay late.

In general, quite positive.  A couple of comments, though, after running
them through my calculator.

1.  The choice for population multiplier leads to some interesting results,
which may need some tweaking.  The standard population digit is determined
by a 2D-2, and the above gives the multipler.

The following charts list the chance in 36 of seeing a given digit
	pop	pop mult
0	1	0
1	2	1
2	3	2
3	4	3
4	5	4
5	6	21
6	5	4
7	4	3
8	3	2
9	2	1
A	1

To see how many worlds in 36*36, or 1296, worlds are expected to have a
given pop digit and multiplier, multiply the two numbers above.  In other
words, out of 1296, we expect to see 6*21 or 126 worlds with 50,000 people.
 We expect to see only 24 worlds with a population of 40,000, and 24 with
populations of 60,000.  Perhaps more disturbing, we would expect to have
105 worlds with 5,000 and with 500,000 people, so we are far more likely to
have a world with ten times as many people, as one which has only 20% more.

Note: there is no way to get an uninhabited world.  Since I drop all worlds
with populations below a ten thousand to zero, or come up with a reason,
this is not a problem for me.

In my game, very few worlds have less than a million people.  (This is, in
my mind, well below that needed to support a technological population, and
thus the scouts may well ignore them.

I also have decided that the peak of the curve is at roughly 250 million
people.  It decays off of that quickly for low population, and more slowly
for high population.

As an easy proposal, how about having pop A worlds have a different chart
than other worlds, as follows:
2D	pop 	PM for pop A
2	1	1
3	2	1
4	3	1
5	4	1
6	5	1
7	6	1
8	7	1
9	7	2
A	8	3
B	9	4
C	A	5

Non pop A worlds have the multiplier is determined as before - ~11 percent
chance for each possibility between 1 and 9.

Note: for my own universe, I have a more detailed system:

1/3 of all worlds are uninhabited.  1/6 have populations less than 6.  1/6
have populations of 6 and 7, with heavy weighting towards high sevens.  1/6
have populations between 9 and 10, with heavy weighting on the low nines.
The remaining 1/6 have a population of 8, with the largest likelihood being
around 300,000,000, and a slow decay as it goes up.  There are more worlds
with population 9 than 10, and most of the worlds with population 10 have a
population of ten billion.

These can be fiddled, and when I have finished the stats, I will let anyone
know who cares, but I am assuming this is because those worlds that
actually grew during the Long Night tended to be good worlds.

2.  Is it really correct that 21/36 of all worlds do not have an asteroid
belt?  This seems OK to me, but my impression was that such belts were
common in Traveller, as opposed to only existing on 7 worlds in 7/12.  If
we do this, belt mining becomes more reasonable, in those relatively few
systems that have such belts.

3.  I like the larger number of gas giants.  This seems to match the solar
system a tad batter, with its 4 gas giants, than the old systems I saw
which would put this at the top of the scale.  This does mean that only one
world in six will be lacking a gas giant - do we want to make fuel skimming
that much more likely?  (I do, but this may not be the norms.)

4.  The port rules imply that 1 world in 12 has a class A, and 1 world in
12 has a class E.  Ship construction would likely become more important,
then, on those worlds that could do it.  Further, an additional 3/12 come
from worlds that can build non starships, so approximately 1/3 of all
worlds can have significant SDB capability easily.  (SBDs will require
maintenance, which would require a class A or B facility, unless I have
misunderstood the rules.)

Damn good question.  PE gives some decent answers, but I am being somewhat
heretical on this one.

The way I did it was to calculate the total GDP.  I then have a tax of 5%
for the imperial military, and 2% for all support services provided by the
Imperium, including nobles estates, research projects, starport
maintenance, and so on.  This 7% tax, in general, either produced things
that went off world, or went off world directly, and so represented star
port activity.  This gave me a direct amount of money, which could then map
to goods, which form a major part of off world traffic.  Given the
infrastructure to support these needed activities, further cargo shipment
is likely of the same order.

I have also done a different take, in which I assumed that ocean travel
today is roughly equivalent, more or less, to stellar travel in the 3I, and
so similar numbers of people travel.  If this is roughly the same, then the
system is more consistent.  Goods, over the long haul, can be more value
dense than people, but if the two numbers are similar, then I can get a
rough idea of the value of a ton of cargo space.

My final check was to see that the cost per ton of cargo of a merchant
vessel made some sense.  I am assuming in my universe that merchant ships
tend to be far less valuable than the goods they carry, thus a pirate will
want to take the stuff, without being too motivated to take the ship in
question.  Further, a large insurance policy for the crew will make the
pirates consider ransom, instead of murder.  If this number fit, then I
would be happy that my measures were consistent.

Input numbers:
Per million people at TL 12:
PCGDP: 10000MCr
fleet:  500MCr

Average cost per ton of a merchant vessel:
	0.016-0.1 depending on luxury
Average cost, per ton of cargo, of a paramilitary vessel:
	0.25 MCr
Average cost, per ton of cargo, of a military vessel:

Passengers/ton:

Ticket costs:
	Frozen: 100
	Steerage: 300
	Low: 600
	Mid: 1200
	High: 2500

The average goods shipped should be value dense, or they are not worth
paying for the shipping costs.  Judging by today\'s goods, my ballpark
estimate for containerized cargo says that a ton of value dense goods is
probably worth 10KCr, or twenty times the shipment cost for one "average"
jump.

Therefore, to determine traffic for such a world, per million people.

Measure one - taxes:
700MCr becomes about 70,000 tons of value dense traffic for this
population.  For this, merchants will get 35MCr.  Assuming that a similar
amount to that paid out in taxes is imported/exported another 70kt is
needed.  This gives us 0.07 tons of high value goods per person.  If an air
car is a one ton unit, then an imported air car could be bought by up to
one person in 14 in a given year, by these rules.

Thus, merchants have made 70MCr moving 140Kt of goods for this planet.
This will require 47 typical containerized cargo vessels to stop on this
world once in the year.  A typical cargo vessel makes 25 stops a year, and
thus 2 ships could handle this level of traffic.  Those two ships would run
on the order 90MCr to purchase, which means that roughly 18MCr a year will
recover the base construction costs, leaving 52 to cover expenses not
assumed in standard maintenance.

In addition, value-light cargo of similar cost, but up to ten times as much
volume will likely arrive on a typical world.  This implies roughly 0.7
displacement tons of cheap goods, such as organics, raw materials,
foodstuffs, or other goodies per citizen, giving another 350MCR for moving
700Kt of goods.  This would take 233 stops, which can be done by ten more
ships.

So, we have a total traffic, per million people, of 12 merchant ships.
These are 3Kt bulk carriers.

Now, if people generate a lot more off world trade than they do military or
Imperial money, then we need correspondingly more ships.  For example, if
we have 15% of the economy going off world, then we need to have an
additional (roughly) 24 ships.  This is the equivalent of virtually
everyone buying a new foreign air car each year, plus 8 cubic meters of
imported goodies a MONTH.  This seems like an acceptable upper bound.

Since these ships only have a few crew spaces, most likely, then we do not
have a lot of spacers - possibly just a few hundred per million.

I will leave passenger traffic for a later time, but note that it is likely
to be a smaller economic impact, since cargo does not complain, and does
not need to be fed, while passengers do, thus merchants will be able to cut
closer to the margin with freight.

One way is to stress the uniqueness of the Imperial culture.  IMTU most
worlds are REALLY Vilani, much like India crossed with Japan.  The
occasional Solomani dominatant world stands out!  In my universe
Imperial culture is heavily influenced by Vland but is still rather
Solomani.

To me the solution IS to isolate them-make your PC\'s feel like aliens in
a strange culture.  The Imperium rules the starlanes, not the worlds. 
So the Imperial Culture is a culture of space and spacefarers-their
buddies and other Imperials.

That is not to say many worlds don\'t have have a strong lean in this
direction(Imperial,) but the PC\'s should be drawn to each other not the
local populace. Additionally, the PC\'s should find a great deal of
common ground in the military and the nobility circles that form the
core of the "Imperial culture."  These folks should be very much like
the PC\'s and unlike the generally closed minded worlds the group
visits-open but conservative, "western" with some Vilani influences. 
And strong commitment to the government that brings them identity and
binds them to each other in the vast reaches of the Third Imperium.

Having problems with an individual player?  Here you have to detail a
stong background riddled with history, NPC\'s and contacts of interest to
yourself and the PC.  These NPC\'s and events should each elaborate on a
section or tidbit of the Imperial culture, drawing him in and co-opting
him as he explores the options.  ie make him the center of attention for
awhile, but to be so he must explore that background.  Make him red up
and be the expert instead of telling him everything.  Eventually he will
"go critical" and run on his own.  One or two exceptionally cool events
directly contrasting/highlighting the character\'s Imperial heritage will
light the fire if the player is good.

An example of a flavour tidbit from my campaign of no great import, but
still important to the feel of the game I run:

As the Captain and entourage approach the hatch, Lt Prainden, the pilot,
comes aft and apologizes.  Interneviss pops the iris valve and soon
Hollandhaise and his accompanyment are aboard Battleship Razor.  There
they are rung aboard by the Bosons Mate on the Quarterdeck, a lavish
affair decorated by elegant and splendid  paintings and military decor
from the navies of several patron worlds.  Particularly noticable is a
Dancini painitng of Nelsons apocryphal appearance at the Battle of 
Kuril.   the painting depicts the spirit of Admiral Nelson, replete with
ancient British dress and cap, urging on the gallant but outnumbered
Terrans at Kuril.  Of course the Terrans went on to defeat the Vilani in
that battle, and no one really knows the true origin of the story.)

Just a bit of color. Who cares about a stinking painting BUT is is
there.  Now say that the PC\'s great great great grandmother was
Dancini\'s lover and knew the true story of that painting.  And perhaps
someone desired to have that old relic and sell it to some high paying
Vilani who maybe didn\'t like the "legend."  And maybe it was up to the
PC to protect his families legacy and honor.  And honor is the Imperial
culture, the one thing IMHO that makes it really different from ours.

Lots of little incidents like this grab players.  Make Imperial culture
unusual but close enough that they can be alienated by everything else.
Make them step up and edumacate the npc\'s.  Then they will know what it
feels like to be Imperial.

On the lighter side of things (or not,

"Most Wanted List", an in-house publication

It\'s a "People"-style celebrity gossip

Actually I was thinking of replicating their culture. However in doing
that I came up with another idea: just how superstitious are the citizens
of the 3rd Imp? (don\'t ask me how I made that connection)

Think of starship crews, they spend about half their lives in Jumpspace
(a very weird place); they must be some of the most superstitious people
around. So just what myths and legends do spacers have? What monsters are
rumoured to inhabit Jumpspace?

This was just my idle wonderings if the Traveller game mechanics could be
adapted to other genres. I think it could (well I think it would be
interesting to try).

Thanks for the reply and the formulas.  I understand the progression; my
use of the term "logarithmic" was imprecise.  I should have said that the
ratios are closer to being logarithmic than linear.

When modeling a hull as a set of several geometric solids, one must remove
the portions of the surfaces which are up against another solid.  That is
difficult and requires CAD, IMHO.


Thanks,

I agree, it should only require a simple triangulation of several shots to
give a targeting solution on a deep site.  That\'s not how they did it,
though, so I guess that those little buggers are a bit harder to track.

Yep.  Doing it by hand is the most difficult part of ship design for me.
But I sure am proud when I finish a hullform.

Traveller is remarkably ignorant of potential synergies in its many
technologies.  They seem to almost be "compartented," with little
apparent cross-pollination.  IMO, meson countertargetting might not
be easy, but it would be possible.  So would counterargetting vs.
grav focues lasers.

It works quite well.  I once ran a campign were all the characters were
from a Low Tech World with no interaction with the 3I.  Great fun, based it
on Sharpe\'s Rifles.

It has sensors that analyze the alien craft and depending on its

Thats why we have back-ups. Perhaps it sends an ID-marker signal to the
opposing craft and with no/wrong response signal it attacks. 

Or maybe an advanced image recognition system. We know all the targets from
sensor data, feed it into the drones and theres little chance of mistakes
unless another identical ship bounces into the game. 

Then i guess the drone chooses the most likely target. Even two identical
ships must differ somewhat.

As for damage on the computer: wrap it into hard armour and put it safely
in the middle of the ship. Its very similar to a black box in planes, only
this is an an active one.

OK, but, I get the same kind of results when I try to do a GET.  The

I would think that IR masking would *definitely* be included.  Combat
Environment Suits (TL 10) have basic IR masking using a chemical chill can
which makes them IR invisible for 45 minutes and at TL 12 the suits can
have a chameleon option which "selectively bleeds heat to match the
background IR level, effectively rendering the solider invisible to IR
sensors."  From Mercenary (CT Book 4) page 41.  The CE suit is in CT, MT,
and TNE, and in CT & MT it weighs 2 kg, so this IR masking doesn\'t weigh
very much.  I always assumed it was a network of thermally conducting
wires and micor-thin metal strips and solid-state cooling and heating
circuits woven into the suit.  I see no reason why the stealth suits could
not also have a similar IR chameleon option.  This IR chameleon option
looks to be considerably easier than actual visible-light color changing. 

Anyway, for the visible chameleon effect, I thought about this a bit, and
based on chameleon painting of ships and such I\'d introduce the following: 

TL 11 or 12:  Color changing fabric: Combat gear can change to up to a
dozen pre-set patterns such as desert cammo, arctic cammo, jungle cammo,
jet black, and international orange (for easy rescue)... 

TL 12 or 13: Basic Chameleon clothing:  Clothing can match its basic color
with the general environment.  Instead of having to rely on a pre-set
jungle cammo suit this cloth will change so that it contains the same
basic colors and patterns of its surroundings.  The detail and resolution
of this color changing is fairly rough, so it works well as night, in
cover, and at long distances, but is quite obvious close up, even if the
target is stationary. 

TL 14 or 15:  Full Chameleon Clothing: Clothing can do a detailed match of
its surroundings, the resolution is even better than the color-changing
flounders which are capable of (roughly) imitating plaid.  Someone
standing against a brick wall will have a detailed version of the pattern
of the brick wall upon their clothing. Seen from straight on at more than
10 meters away this camouflage works extremely well even in broad
daylight, as long as the subject is stationary or moves slowly.  Running
causes the pattern to blur noticeably. 

TL 15 or 16:  Same as above, but no blur when running.

I used to work with a guy who suffered brain damage from a car
accicdent.  His problem
was he would only remember something for about 10 minutes and then
forget it.
However, he could remember everything that happened if it was about 24
hours or more
in the past.

The problem with fighters isnt that they blow up with depressing
regularity. The problem is that they do not have the length or volume to
mount big enough weapons to hurt most warships (range is a functon of
length for meson guns and particle accelerators).

Therefore, they tend to be relegated to police and customs work (which they
do well IMO).

Taking out the pilot also saves mostly volume - pilots and their
crestations dont weigh much, and with non-jump ships it is mass not volume
that is your main limit.

A police cutter needs a lot more human decision making than a combat ship
does.

BTW, if any of you would care to send some more idea for tools, please
do so.

And now some comments/answers to the various points people debated after
the original message.

Clark Crawford and others discussed the possibility of introducing some
mechanics about Certification/Exam, Professional Orders and so on.

Personally I\'d prefer not to define any mechanics for it. Consider that
in T4 (and the same holds for the older editions, IIRC), you are
considered a certified doctor when you reach Medical-3. The same would
do for any technical branch, I think. I understand that the career
doesn\'t offer high benefits like TAS or a ship.
Should we add TAS/Ship to any career in the name of play balance? I
don\'t think so. Army offers very little in material benefits, for
example.

Steve Daniels suggested both a new name for the career and a rank
structure for it.
Believe it or not, I had already considered both ideas and decided to
discard them. I ruminated on alternate names (Artificer, Architect,
Gearhead, Builder, Engineer) and then, having looked at Scholar, Artist,
Merchant, Noble and Agent decided that Technician would do just nicely.

About the rank: I accept the rank structure for the official careers,
even when they don\'t make a lot of sense to me (why should Merchants
have ranks?) but I\'d prefer to restrict them to military or tightly
organized structures. The proposed career try to covers a lot of
different professions. "Level Names" or ranks don\'t seem right to me.

    'body' => 'I\'ve been thinking about Meson Guns, deep meson sites and the "flavour" 
I want in my Traveller Universe.  I\'m still thinking about options:

(1) mesons are travelling close to the speed of light and some (a half, 
a quarter?) will decay by the time the mesons reach their target.  
Fired a split second behind the mesons is a less powerful electroweak 
wave (as described in the Unified Hand Wave Theory) that catches up 
with the mesons as they reach the target.  The electroweak wave 
encourages the mesons to decay almost immediately ... mostly inside the 
ship if the targetting worked correctly.

(2) Meson screens interfere with the electroweak wave, preventing the 
"premature" deacy so that the mesons carry on through the target with 
no damage.  The trick is to get your screens to be active for the right 
period of time (as these things would need too much power to run 
continuously) and in the right region of the ship, which allows you to 
have a chance of meson guns penetrating screens.

(3) deep meson guns could have the electroweak projector coming from a 
different site (or several sites) and can be much more powerful - say 
10x the size of the meson gun itself.  Because the electroweak wave is 
so much stronger you can:
(a) have mesons of higher energy (higher speed) so that decay losses 
before the target are much lower (making tracking back to the meson gun 
site much harder)
(b) much more likely to pentrate meson screens 

(4) some of us like the old Imperium board game, and think that 
planetary defense in Traveller should be more like that ... just big 
spinal mounts that can be located by the enemy and destroyed, albeit at 
potentially huge losses to your ships if you do not have big screens! 

(5) During the 5th Frontier War, how dificult would it have been to 
find out where the Imeperial meson sites are (c.f. modern day nuclear 
missile sites).  You can talk to construction workers, off-duty 
personnel, caterers, etc (carousing skill), find no-fly zones from 
commercial air traffic ("hmm, is that an open cast copper mine they 
won\'t let us fly over?  I\'ll bet it is for a meson site").  During the 
peace before a big war, meson sites would be compromised and of 
relatively easy to destroy (they can\'t dodge).

For worlds that are on military alert and deperately trying to keep to 
enemy scouts (say, in a pocket Empires / Imperial Squadrons campaign), 
the location of the meson sites will not be well known.  Similarly, if 
you have only just contacted a world you will not know of any meson 
sites - this would surely have been the case for Sabquimys (sp?) and 
the poor lone scout vessel.


Simon
PS For those contemplating using Greg Porter\'s Slag! system for space 
combat, meson guns and meson screens can be relatively easily added:

MG = Meson Gun: Each hit does 2 points less damage than a equivalent PA 
but is not reduced by the targets Damage Modifier, armour or Force 
Screens.  Initial hit location is always determined randomly** and 
works its way through the ship the same way a PA hit would (so that a 
hit could end up doing less damage than a PA that works its way 
inwards).  Armour is a valid hit location, but is not destroyed by the 
meson hit.  Aux power units increase the rating in the normal manner 
for spinal mounts.

MS = Meson Screens: Add (or subtract for shots from the rear) Size to 
the initial hit location.  Each extra functioning MS box adds (or 
subtracts) 1 more from the hit location.

** random hit loaction: use a dice of the appropriate size (d20 for a 
20 system ship) or use a diceless equivalent (example for 15-system 
ship): firing player writes down a number 1-15, the target player 
states a number 1-15.  The firing players number is revealed and the 
two are added.  If the total is over 15, subtract 15 to find the 
initial location.

Well, i believe there is a solution for everything and if normal methods
aint enough then lets try an unconventional approach.

Think of this scenario:

20 drone fighters close in on a destroyer of a cruiser with high speed and
agility. Because of the no-crew option it can have whatever G possible to
its design. They are equipped with masking tech and slim in design to make
them hard to pick with guns. They have missile-jamming technology and
decoys to elude missile, its speed eludes the most of the guns. While the
most of em wastes the turrets and bays with missiles and guns, a second
wave with belly mounted mines approach. They sweep down and drop the
magnetic mines in strategic positions so that when they are detonated, they
waste or badly cripple the cap ship. This would be possible when there\'s no
protecting screens or shields on them. They may loose up to 20% in drones
but killed of a rather large opponent.

There is no thing as impregnable armour.

Well...I\'ve got one for you.  I\'m about one third the way through 
this book, and it\'s about the most Traveller sci-fi book I\'ve read in 
a long time.

Which book?

The Voyage, by David Drake, pub. \'94.

What\'s the story like?

Well, there\'s this noblewoman, and she\'s trying to regain some power 
within her House.  

So, she thinks she can do this by locating this high tech device that 
is rumored to exist on a planet on the edge of known space and bring 
the device back to her House.  She\'s jutting for political leverage 
as the Noble House in question is an interstellar trading firm (hmmm, 
Traveller doesn\'t have many of those, does it?) and the device is 
supposed to be a matter transporter (which is extremely high tech in 
both the book\'s and Traveller\'s universe).

How\'s she going to get this thing?  

Well, she builds a ship, of course.  Then she sends out invitations 
to known mercenaries from the sector.  She gathers them all together, 
and off they go, in search of this device.

Now....that doesn\'t sound like an M0 adventure module, now does it?

You\'ve got a noblewoman leading the way...army/marine characters 
rolled up for the muscle...planets to go to that nobody knows much 
about...and you\'re in search of high technology.

I\'m playing my campaign in the 1100\'s era, so I don\'t view it as a M0 
adventure.  I see it more as something that would take place in the 
Spinward Marches--as the ship head out for non-Imperial space in the 
adjacent Foreven or Far Frontiers sectors.

If that\'s not enough Traveller correlation for you, take a look at 
this, from page 16.

++++++++++++++++++++++

He looked sharply at Ned.  "I gather from the curriculum in your ID 
you know something about ships yourself?"

Ned shrugged.  "I\'ve had a course in basic navigation, " he agreed.  
"In a pinch, I\'d be better than punching in coordinates blind, I 
suppose.  And fusion bottles are pretty much the same, tanks or 
spaceships."

++++++++++++++++++++++++

This could be in a book (like it is), or it could be an excerpt from 
a Traveller role-play session.  The GM is running the NPC, and he\'s 
asking the player\'s character, Ned, what his skills are.

It sounds like, to me, that Ned has got Navigation-0.  Since Nav is 
not a default skill, the GM has allowed the player to use some bit of 
knowledge the character has picked up--the Navigation class--as a 
basis for using Nav at 0 level.

Ned sounds competent at engineering.  I\'d give him Engineering-2.

And...was that a Universal ID they were talking about?

Check this out, from page 18.

+++++++++++++++++++

The adjutant paused at the base of the boarding bridge and looked out 
across the dockyard.  A mobile crane squealed as its boom lowered a 
drive motor into place.  A dirigible carried a slingload of hull 
plates slowly across the sky to a freighter being constructed at the 
opposite end of the complex.  The thrum of nacell-mounted props 
provided a bass line to the yard\'s higher pitched activities.

+++++++++++++++++++

So, what have we got here?

It\'s definitely a Class A or B starport.  From what I\'ve read, I\'d 
say it\'s a Class A.  The ship building facilities seem to be pretty 
well equipped.

But a dirigible?

Yep.  Just like in Traveller, you\'ll have a low tech planet with 
higher tech starport.  There\'s always an integration of technology 
when you have a situation like this--at least that\'s how I play it in 
my games.  

On Pysadi, for instance, in the Aramis subsector of the Spinward 
Marches, you\'ve got a Class C starport on a TL 4 world.  Class C 
starports are minimum TL 8 (see your World Builder\'s Handbook), yet 
the infrastructure of the planet is TL 4.

When my players landed there, I noted how this Class C starport was 
run.  They could have some minor damage to the ship repaired, and 
these large, mobile, self contained (definitely from 
off-planet) repair facilities were driven up beside the ship.  
Workers got out of the trucks and repaired the ship.  

My players noted how everything high-tech in the star port was 
accomplished with some sort of mobile, self contained unit that was 
probably imported from off world--it\'s like a high tech facility here 
on Earth located in a poor, third world country.  Everything has to 
be shipped in.

But, my players really got a surprise when they went to see about 
obtaining a cargo for their next jump.  The Pysadians have a big 
chalk board!  And, they keep track of cargoes with a pencil and 
index-card system!

The TL 4 of the planet was showing through, and it\'s the same in this 
book.  There\'s this high class starport, yet dirigibles are being 
used to ferry bulk parts around--no grav units here.

The planet\'s infrastructure just doesn\'t support it.

What else is Traveller about the book?

Answer:  many things.  The technology in this universe is similar to 
that in Traveller.  It\'s not exact, but close enough--so close you 
can take most instances from the book and use them directly in your 
Traveller campaign, whether you\'re running M0 or M1100.

The starport mentioned above is in Landfall City on the planet 
Telaria.  That sounds like Startown or Pysadian Downport, doesn\'t it?

And, the records they use to track their course to this planet on the 
frontier--it\'s called pilotry data.  Hmmm, very similar to Library 
data, right?

And, you can see them talk about the character\'s skills, if you look 
between the lines.  This, from page 19.

+++++++++++++++++++

"Oh, she\'s got guts, all right," Tadziki said.  "Brains, too.  
Lissea\'s foster father had her trained as an electronics engineer, 
and she\'s a good one.  I doubt there was ever anything Lissea really 
cared about besides booting her uncle out of the presidency, but 
she\'s an asset to the expedition as an engineer, believe me."

++++++++++++++++++

Competent professional in electronics?  Yep, I\'d say Electronics-3.  
And that guy--Tadziki.  Isn\'t that a Vilani name?

Lissea\'s definitely Solomani, and she\'s definitely a noble, playing 
the political game within her own House.

This is so similiar to my own game.  I\'ve got a Noble, who owns the 
ship, who has had a lot of trouble with his House.  The problem is 
that it is decimated by two rival Houses that got together on his 
homeworld and ganged up on him.  So, now, he\'s leading a small 
merchant vessel around, vying for time while he tries to come up with 
a plan to put his House back together.

In this book, we\'ve got a noblewoman, with a mercenary crew, jumping 
from planet to planet, in search of this bit of high technology.  
And, if she brings it back, she\'ll be in a position of power within 
her own house.

This book is set up like a Traveller adventure.  There\'s plenty of 
action (at least in the one third I\'ve read), and it is so much like 
Traveller, I forget sometimes that it doesn\'t have Traveller on the 
cover.

It\'s definitley not an earth-shaking book--one that will make you 
contemplate the whys and why-fors of the universe, but if you are in 
the mood for a good Traveller read, it will certainly hit the spot.

For that reason, I\'m recommending it to the list.

Kenneth.

Paolo,

I just wanted to drop a note about your new career, unfortunately I haven\'t
taken the time to study it in detail, at a breif overview it looked very
well done. In the same vein if I am rehashing old ground then please ignore
these idle ramblings.

First let me say that I agree with the above paragraph whole heartedly. In
fact I have found that the proliferation of ships as a mustering out benefit
to be a problem, and have restricted them among my own groups, going back to
the early CT days. I\'ve had too many multiple ship groups splinter. At any
rate this is not really a career area where a ship is an appropriate reward,
most in this profession will either travel under a company or corperate
reason, and be given passage as the occation warrents, or be working passage
off.

On the subject of ranks, I would prefer to see you keep them non-official,
or similar to the doctor skill, as you imply, a certain level of skill
confers First class or Master\'s status. The way I am currently picturing it
a Task will be appropriate for a ranking within a society or union but as a
seperate roll playing aspect AFTER the chargen.

In other word a technician lands on a planet and looks for work, he/she is
told that he/she must belong to this union or this guild or whatever. At
that time the character rolls a task against his/her skill level to see
where IN THAT PLANET\'S EXPERTISE  he/she falls. In some cases this will
confer a "rank".

Likewise if an engineer applies to the Imperial Society of Mechanical
Engineers (for example) and passes the appropriate tests (tasks) they can
add the title "Professional Engineer (PE)" to their name and resume. This is
simulair to how this happens today.

Just some thought. At any rate a very nicely done peice of work that will be
added to my books. Thank you.

Hauntings don\'t strike me as a Traveller staple, but they should be.  This
is the subject of Terrorspace (hopefully to be an RPGA event at DragonCon
this year; we had to cancel at GenCon last year *pout*).  More on this

Very superstitious.  Everyone has their "bizarre" customs.  One example is
the Vilani practice of dimming the ship\'s lights prior to jump (they may
call it tradition from the days of yore when they had to so in order to have
enough power to jump, but we know the truth - calling a superstition
anything else doesn\'t change it\'s nature, regardless of whether it had its
basis in fact: there were darn good reasons not to let women sail the seas,
but that didn\'t change the fact that it developed into a superstition).

You wouldn\'t have to change much... rename the psionic powers, add some new
ones, and some special effects to existing powers, and voila!  You have
magic.  One thing to make it more palatable to fantasy players might be to
require meditation to regain "power points" instead of allowing them to
"magically" regenerate through the psionist\'s own innate ability to draw
power from some unnamed source.  (I do this already for dedicated psionists;
the reluctant psionists - those that aren\'t sure if they are or not, heh! -
don\'t know where they get their power, or even if they have any available at
any given time.)

CANON CHECK
I\'ve always believed that canon stated that a PC\'s Psi score could NEVER
rise after age 18, however there are bonuses to Psi to be found in the
Psionist profession!  Does this indicate that Psi can rise through
development?  Or that the game mechanics needed to find a way for a player
to sacrifice other things in exchange for a high Psi score?  I\'ve been
meaning to ask Ken... but I don\'t want to disturb his work on Dark
Conspiracy 2ed.  Anybody know?


Terrorspace
[025-051iii]  The central villain of Terrorspace is the Vilani pirate Tyme
(of the M:0 era) who haunts the Zhunalines superliner ISS Diapason after his
abortive attempt to capture her (the last in n-space anyway), until she
leaves j-space, but sightings of Tyme aboard other ships in j-space continue
to this day.

As the story begins, the young Duchess Aan Nina Karrin is taking the first
\'Imperial Cruise\' in years, sponsored by her favorite (aging) uncle, Cleon I
in the hopes that the taste of "adventure" will inhibit her wild tendencies
(she is an orphan and a degreed psionicologist, potentially embarrassing to
the dynasty) thus making her easier to marry off - at which point she
becomes someone else\'s problem.  It is the PCs\' responsibility to \'safely\'
expose her to the perils of "adventure" as opposed to the benefits and
security of the life of a respectable member of the Imperial family.
Diapason is taken, per Tyme\'s style, through a combination of sabotage and
boarding - possible only through incompetence and distrust between the crew
of Diapason and the arrogant Marine security team commander.  The ship\'s
maneuver drives are disabled and the bridge taken/destroyed.  After Tyme\'s
corvette closes with the superliner and boarding begins, the chief engineer
engages the jump drive just as Tyme begins to cross the boarding tube to
Diapason to join his boarding party.  [And the adventure begins...]  Caught
in the fringe of the "jump bubble," Tyme\'s physical being is rent asunder.
He is now neither an n-space being nor a j-space being - there is no theory
to explain his being at all.  Only the sheer will to live of an exceptional
man holds his existence together... and all he can remember is the woman he
sought to hold for ransom.

	Discarding Sabot. The actual round is much smaller than the barrel diameter, so spacers are placed around it while in the cartridge. The spacers keep the round moving straight down the barrel, and then fall off as soon as it leaves the muzzle. The result is you get a round with very high velocity and very small cross-section. The energy is therefore concentrated onto a smaller area at impact.

>b) Should a DS round have a danger space  and if so why?

	No.

Most security systems IMTU use ultrasonic motion detectors, similar to a
bat\'s sonar. Another advantage for high-tech stealth suits would be a sonic
dampening module which listens for ultrasonic frequencies and transmits a
phase-inverted frequency. This could also be used with audible sounds; so
the wearer could talk into a throat mike and not be heard by someone
standing next to her.


This would be effective against motion detectors of the same tech level but
less so at higher tech levels, for the same reason as visual detection.
More advanced motion detectors could monitor background objects and detect
the sonic \'dead zone\' created by the suit. More advanced suits could mimic
the effects of background objects, while more advanced detectors could use
encoded or directional pulses, and so on.

I suggest sonic dampening be introduced at TL 13 and only be effective
against sensors at the TL of manufacture or before.

Anyone ever read "Nightflyers" by George R.R. Martin?  Excellent story
about a mysterious frieghter.  I modified it for a M:0 game.  The
characters come across a 2I derelict drifting near a gas giant.  The ship
appears to be a luxury yacht, worth a fortune.  As the palyers explore,
they start seeing things, then the ship starts trying to kill them...

The story is that two powerful psionicists had died abord the ship, and
transferred their "souls" to a specialy prepared matrix to await rescue.
During the 1500 year wait, one had gone insane, and was psychotic, while
the other, weaker entity was trying to warn the players off.  Made for some
spooky role play, with the ship lit by dim lighting and creaking
mysteriously...

The episode of B5 with the technomages has given me several ideas for
"magical" encounters in Traveller.  Psionocists with high (Ancient?) tech
aides could make Clarke\'s law a daily reality.

I\'m actually gathering material for a short compendium of Sayat
"technositition" which ought to be borrowable for the 3I proper as well.
Besides feeling there\'s a "special connection" between nuclear fusion and
pregnancy, and feeling it prudent to slaughter livestock before their jump
drives, and being big believers in hanging "lucky charms" from their
rear-view mirrors, they\'re going to have a lot of other so-called
superstitions, too, before I\'m done.

Traveller\'s got heaps of gee-whiz technological/scientific handw^H^H^H
groundwork, and plenty of religious fervor in the background.  But there\'s
no mention of that middle ground of pragmatically-oriented semirational
behaviour and belief which doesn\'t fit into an organized system of faith or
body of formal doctrine.

How about "101 Superstitions", folks?

In the "also of use" for running ports category, there\'s the article "R&R" in
the "Best of the Journal" volume 2.  I\'m not sure what issue it appeared in
originally though.  It details not the Starport itself, but instead the
"startown" around it, and the various trouble that could find PCs there.

Thanks, much appreciated.  Some of my favorite gaming supplements were the
"Uncle Al\'s" series of catalogs for Car Wars (where every item had just a
little personality, and there were free gifts if you ordered now), and the
Aurora\'s Whole Realms catalog (for AD&D), which a lot of thought went into
writing...

I hope a little of that shows through at the very least...

My "background flavor" posts will be slowing over the next two weeks, as I\'m
pushing ahead full steam on dull background info for the campaign I\'m running,
and at some point before the end of the month, I will be switching to a
different service provider.

Food Extruders is more fast food. The franchisee get this big honking machine
that extrudes the food like toothpaste out of a tube (or playdoh out of a fun
factory. Lotsa different stuff. Hot dog, bun, and condiments, all at once.
hero/po-boy/hoagie/whathaveyou, bread, meat, tomatolets, lettuceoid, sauce,
all at once. Hardboiled eggs, yellow centers, white outsides -- the franchisee
(or his surly, pimply-faced hirlings) operate a guilotine-like device, and cut
off the alleged food when the customer asks (Hence the other trademarked motto
of FE(tm): "Say When!"). It was one of those running gags we incorporated into
the background. I thought it was a joke until I say the Nova titled "The
Making of a Snack Food" and saw some British snack food company _extruding_
stuff a mile a minute. Bread tube with a meat filling, baking as it came out
of the machine, and a blade cutting it into snack-sized chunks.

Remind me sometime to tell you (and your Sayat friends) about the Zhodani
Secret Gelding Grip(tm)...you might find it entertaining.

In CT and Mayday that had a "laser return fire phase".  Fire in this phase
was subject to a penalty.  IIRC, it was only possible by ships which had
just been fired upon, against the ships which had just fired at them.  If
not, well, that\'s how I always took it.  After all, laser fire is a dead

OK, so say it will not attack a Type A Free Trader.  So I could attack &

This is a great idea, but one problem.  How would you maintain this

Fine, if that the way you feel about it, I will have a nuclear party in

Btw, IMTU the !st IW starts when a Val. Scout Ship with a 150 MT warhead

    Might I suggest that these are more properly put together?  With QSDS being
something of a subset of FF&S2.  Thus people could simply design a ship with
QSDS and then use FF&S2 to create the detailed portion to be "pluged into" the

everything into the appropriate types of files, and make the data freely
exchangable between Cartos and Metator that would be Great!
    Are you going to expand Metator to handle Pocket Empires econ extensions

excites the player.  The starport illustrations are probably a good example.
While the Champa layout in JTAS #7 was interesting enough, those in White
Dwarf #43 were exciting, although not official.  (I hope Rob does the
illustrations because he has the attention to detail that can capture this.)

2)  Useful material. Detailed administrative hierachies, starport
infrastructure, and the like are amusing.  But these can probably be replaced
with material of more use to players and referees.  Startown Liberty is an
example of something that is very useful.  I probably got more use out of
those expanded encounter tables than any other publication related to
starports.

  To move in the direction of specifics, I had the following in mind:

1)  Discussion - Details of each port class.  Rescue facilities/shelters.  Who
builds/maintains the ports.  Tech variations.  Costs.  Capacities. 
Bases/outposts. Planetary interdiction.

2)  Port Authority - Inbound/outbound procedures.  Ship encounters and ships
in port. Communication.  Security.  Regulations.  Customs and smuggling.
Violation resolution. Alien and passenger services.

3)  Vehicles - Space tug, rescue vessel, customs/patrol craft, small orbital
dock, ship tender, interdiction satellite.  (A shuttle and interplanetary
vehicles were included in Imperial Encyclopedia.)

4)  Startown - Use in adventures.  Extrality.  R&R.  Alien quarter.  And most
especially the expanded encounter tables from Startown Liberty.  These should
compliment those in Cities.

5)  Character generation - Primarily, this includes an MT revision of the SPA
generator in JTAS #19.  But it can also include the Repo (ship repossessor;
see JTAS #16) and others.

6)  Adventures.
The above encompasses some of the things you mentioned, but isn\'t intended as
a formalized outline.  Following the SOpM format, a different arrangement will
be needed.

  Just as something for thought, the formal title for the book might be Port
Authority Handbook, after Andy Keith\'s column in Far Traveller.  Starports is
certainly a good enough working title for now.                  MIKE MIKESH

Bryan -
That\'s a VERY good question, "how much ship traffic does a given world or
system generate."  There may be some disagreement between Joe and Marc about
this.  One says there\'s a lot of interstellar traffic.  The other says there\'s
very little compared to planetside commerce.  (Off hand, I don\'t remember
which said which, other than the fact I was getting two different messages.)
But its possible they were saying the same thing, but from two different
perspectives.

Bryan, I think it will be very useful to nail down how much tonnage really is
flying around the Imperium.  Get Marc and Joe to agree, then it will be easy
to figure out how much of that a given world sees.

Did I say easy?  It\'d probably require a computer model of the sector
incorporating the trade and commerce rules.  Given the UWPs and trading
vessels within the sector, and balancing the traffic for greatest economic
advantage, you\'ll have the answer.  Perhaps by studying the worlds of the
inner subsectors, you can arrive at a way of estimating for game purposes
without requiring the players to go to the same extents.

OR you can work up a commercial atlas of the Spinward Marches.  No guesswork;
here are the numbers.  But this is drifting off Starports.

About beanstalks, its a shame, but they probably don\'t have a place in
Traveller. Fusion plants make energy too readily available.  Beanstalks,
rotors, and related devices just don\'t offer a savings worth considering.

This isn\'t true in 2300AD, though.  There are two beanstalks in that universe,
and for good reason.  I\'ll bet Challenge would welcome an article on further
details about beanstalks and alternatives engineers of 2300AD may be
considering.

Countertargeting vs any kind of laser is pretty easy (since even the best
laser beam has sidelobes) - this is in the most recent DSR (ships firing
weapons count as "going active".) I\'m not sure why grav focus would make it

21 Feb 98 Issue:

Reeling in satellites - A return ticket for satellites that have reached
the end of the line

A CHEAP way of bringing failed satellites down to Earth is being developed
by an Americancompany. The company,Tethers Unlimited, which is based in
Clinton, Washington, has booked a launch on a Russian rocket in late 1998
or early 1999 to test its special tether.

In theory, satellites should be able to generate electricity from a long
tether. But when NASA launched a satellite to test the idea in 1996, the
tether was severed after just six hours, probably by a small piece of space
junk. The new tether has a web-like structure to enable it to withstand
damage from space junk and the company plans to use it to brake an ailing
satellite, causing it to lose height and fall to Earth.

Over the next few years, hundreds of satellites will be injected into
low-Earth orbit for mobile phone communications. "Iridium, one of the
consortia involved, has already had two failures in the 33 satellites it
has launched," says Robert Forward of Tethers Unlimited. "There is an
urgent need to remove failed satellites from orbit to make way for
replacements." Using a rocket to take a satellite out of orbit would mean
carrying extra fuel into space equivalent to between 5 and 15 per cent of
the satellite\'s mass. The fuel needed to launch this extra mass would add
several million dollars to the launch costs. The tether, which would be up
to 10 kilometres long, will generate electric currents of up to 1 amp as it
cuts through the Earth\'s magnetic field. It is the interaction between the
current in the tether and the Earth\'s magnetic field that would brake a
satellite. Forward says that a tether would only account for 2 per cent of
the satellite\'s mass and would be able to replace a rocket for about a
tenth the price.

The company\'s Terminator Tether is a  multiline cable with a ballast mass
of a few kilograms on one end. The tether would be unwound like a bobbin in
a cotton factory. It would be pulled taut by the differences in gravity at
different altitudes.

According to Forward, once a tether had been unwound it would take a
satellite out, of a 780-kilometre high orbit in less than a : year. It
would take a century for the satellite to come down naturally. The design
of the tether, patented by Forward\'s partner, Robert Hoyt, consists of
three parallel lines with crossed wires zig-zagging between. Unlike a
single strand, which is vulnerable to being severed by just one projectile,
this webbing can resist the bombardment of meteorites and space junk.
Tethers Unlimited, which has a $600 000 . contract from NASA to explore the
concept of a tether, has hired a Scottish knitwear firm Fleming\'s Textile
of Kilmarnock to develop the design. We won\'t have our testing done in time
for Iridium," says Forward. However, he says the company will be ready for
the next generation of low orbit satellites. Marcus Chown NQC

Easy to do.  If they can nuke Paris, they can nuke London, England;
Phoenix, AZ, USA; Moscow, Russia; or Toronto, Canada just as easily.  Mosty
they did it as a warning shot.  "We can nuke any of your cities that we
want to any time we want to." type deal.

*sob* my chance for fame gone ... my original "Trade Stations and Red
Crew/Blue Crew" isnt mentioned.

I\'d also have a look at the Amerigo Vespucci (?) class Frontier Trader -
the one with multiple sub-ships, with the concept being a ship able to drop
off a "portable starport" on a mostly-uncontacted world, which reduces the
time pressure on your trade and contact specialists - you can leave em in
orbit with a couple of grav cars, then check back in 2 months to pick them up.

Sure. It\'s just that not all solutions are cost-effective.

Stealth technology isnt particularily effective in Traveller in a
deep-space context.

It is also difficult to jam missiles at 15 000 km, which is the usual range
of a military nuclear det laser missile.

Losing the g-limits on pilots is an advantage, however the thruster plates
you well need to pull these sorts of gees will cost a lot, making their
loss painful and expensive.

The mines you are talking about would be trivially easy to detect with
LIDAR or other sensors, and thus difficult to use effectivly.

>There is no thing as impregnable armour.

True, but there is armour impregnable to certain weapons. Lasers are the
most effective weapon for small craft at combat ranges (30 000km and up),
and lasers are limited in output by TL. It isnt particularily difficult to
build a warship that will take only surface damage against lasers.

It\'s an interesting concept. See if you can make it work using FFS2.

construction capacity (based on pop) was total and that typical 
military budgets (based on the same pop) only gave a space navy that 
could use around 1/10th of the capacity in normal (peace) times 
.. which also means that the tonnage of the merchant fleet is 10x the 
Navy.  Not all TMLers accepted this argument, which does not surprise 
me :-)

Using a 50-year life, the total construction capacity x 0.9 x 50 = 
merchant fleet size, which gave me an estimate of total displacement 
tons out there.  As POP A worlds (1 in 36) effectively determine the 
size of the merchant fleet, I estimated / guessed the average size and 
frequency with which ships were in port at their POP A home world, 
rather than at one of the other 36 lower POP worlds.  Then with a 
"hand-is-quicker-than-the-eye" move I equated starpot A (actually 1 in 
6 of all worlds in the noraml tables) with this level of traffic and 
got: 

A port = 60 square miles, 1200 berths, 5 billion Cr
..
E port = 0.5 square miles, 6 berths, 15 million Cr

When I was pointed to the article in White Dwarf, I eagerly identified 
areas of similarity to show how clever I had been :-)

        White Dwarf		Me
A	3 runways (5 km x 1 km) 
	600 berths		1200 berths
	40 sq miles		60 sq miles
	60 Naval berths

B	2 runways (5 km x 1 km)
        200 berths
	20 sq miles
	10 scout berths

C	1 runway (5 km x 1 km)
        75 berths
	10 sq miles
	10 scout berths

D	1 runway (5 km x 1 km) 
        20 berths
	8 sq miles
	19 scout berths

E	1 runway (5 km x 1 km)
	No berths		6 berths
	3 sq miles		0.5 sq miles
	10 scout berths


Fortunately, no-one commented on my POP A = starport A sleight of hand, 
so my reputation is safe.

Consider where we might be if von Braun and Co had not been *forbidden*
to do work on satellites and space travel. They had their satellite
ready to launch before the "civilian" one, and *almost* managed to
sneak a launch of it. They got caught and wound up having to sit there
watching the "civilian" satellites keep failing until it became such an
embarassment that the president *had* to let them launch it. 

While I agree with *some* of Eisenhower\'s distrust of the "military
industrial complex", he went overboard and did a lot of *harm* by
cancelling and hampering military space efforts and insisting that NASA
"re-invent the wheel" over and over again.

The Air Force DynaSoar program and the Manned Orbiting Laboratory
planned as a follow on would have given us a space station in the
*60s*. And at least *partially* re-usable vehicles.

And it\'s a crime that the DC-X program didn\'t get chosen as the X-30.
Though I think I\'ve heard mutterings that it may *still* manage to keep
going.

Don\'t forget the *sub*-orbital ideas, like the SpaceCub. If that makes
it into production, once it\'s been proven by enough flights, expect to
see Fed-Ex and UPS buying them. They give 30 minute "hop" times with
about 1000 km cross-range. Which means you can have one *hour* package
delivery between many cities on both coasts, and some in the midwest.

Scale them up some more and you have Heinlein\'s "antipodal shuttles".
And at that point they are also good for some SSTO work.

Most of us *want* to ignore this, because it\'s an artifact of Traveller
focusing on *volume* rather than *mass* as the limits on a spacecraft.

Now, now, Kenji. 

There\'s nothing wrong with wearing spandex. It\'s just that 90%
(minimum) of the people who do are committing a crimee against Humanity
(to say nothing of Good Taste) by doing so. 5 foot tall, 250 lb women
should *not* wear *anything* "form fitting", much less spandex.

	"There are Some Things Man Was not Meant to Know."

And what that sort of body type looks like in spandex is high on the
list! (And I speak as someone who has the equivalent male body type!)

To start with, posting to a *mailing list* is a *lot* different than
posting to a newsgroup.

Second, until therte\'s an actual case, all *anybody* can do is guess,
but according to current copyright law, you can only make a work public
domain by *expliciting* including a statement to that effect *from the
copyright holder*, or by waiting until 50 or 75 years (I forget which)
after the author dies.

In the US, you\'d have to register the copyright before you can sue, and
you can only collect "actual damges" for any infringement that took
place beforte you registered the copyright. Given that both the list
and archives are free, the *best* you\'d likely be able to do is get a
judgement requiring that your postings be removed from future
"editions" of the CD-ROM. And even that would cost a small fortune in
legal fees.

Sorry, but atheism is *not* a "theory". It is based on stating that
something *dos not exist*. Since it is impossible to *prove* a
negative, that makes in "unfalsifiable" and thus *not* a proper theory.

Theories *must* be capable of being tested, and, more importantly, of
being proven *wrong*. Atheism fails tese criteria in *exactly* the same
manner as any other "religious belief".

Sorry, but atheism *is* a statement of *belief*. One that is
incompatible with the scientific method. An atheist is stating that he
*knows* the answer to a question about which we have no usable data and
no prospect of getting any. *That* is what puts it beyond the pale.

No, you have to state that there is no evidence for or against the
existence of a "god" and that thus, the question remains open. 

"no god" is *not* a theory. It\'s a *conclusion*. And one that isn\'t
allowed under the rules. 

Tachyons don\'t seem to exist, not does there seems to be a reason for
them to exist. Yet there\'s a *world* of difference between the
*correct* scientific statement "There is no evidence that tachyons
exist" and the *improper*, *non*-scientific statement "Tachyons don\'t
exist."

God must remain as an *unproven* hypothesis until we can adequately
explain *everything* without him. The universe, from the Big Bang
onward, seems *likely* to follow from the laws of physics. But there\'s
*no* explanation for the laws of physics, especially not of how they
interrelate to produce this universe. Closest we have is the Anthropic
Principle, which is felt to be dodging the question.

So there\'s still room for the *possibility* of God. So the correct
stance according to the rules of science is "no conclusive evidence for
or against". Which just so happemns to be the agnostic position.

You appear to have "faith" that there *isn\'t* a God. Fine. But there\'s
no more evidence for that position than for the opposite.

Would those SpaceCub and other suborbitol shuttles get extremely hot.
So would not there be a waiting period before they cool down.

Does not the SpaceShuttle need to cool down after landing, in order 
for a safe exit by the crew to be made.

BIG problem. The person *has* to be able to sweat. Or else you\'ll need
a cooling unit the size of the ones Shuttle astronauts use when going
EVA. That gives you trouble when it comes to preventing variousd
chemicals from being passed into the surrounding atmosphere.

I haven\'t read anything about it since the 60s, but even then they were
working on detectors to pick up the microgram amounts of the *enormous*
number of volatiles a huan (or other animal/plant) body gives off and
using it to detect intruders. 

Heck, just the CO2 given off is enough to attract mosquitoes (really!)
and thus to make it possible for advanced sensors to spot you. The
various aldehydes and ketones will help.

So at a *minimum* the suit has to include a *very* selectively
permeable membrane. One that will pass water (for sweat and temperature
control), and possibly pass O2 and CO2, but *not* pass anything else. 

On the plus side, this will make it an excellent CBN garment, as the
molecules involved in chemical and biological warfare wiull be too big
to get thru to the wearer. And it\'d also stop most radioactivfallout
and the like from getting thru. It won\'t help against actual radiation
though.

You\'ll have to make the suit act like a counter current heat exchanger
for gases going in and out, as well as allowing out excess heat (which
is apt to be a *real* problem). So respiration will take place over the
entire surface of the suit.

So even given "magic" technology, you have several ways the wearer can
be detected:

1. oxygen consumption (difficult, even at high tech levels)
2. CO2 emmissions (easier)
3. thermal signature. Sorry, but the human body generates a *lot* of
   heat, and there is *no* way to keep the wearer alive without either
   carrying a *huge* unit containing something to "dump" excess heat
   into or radiating as much heat as the wearer produces. If you don\'t
   radiate the heat, the wearer will be *dead* in as little as 10
   minutes.  He\'ll be suffering massive heatstroke in under 5. Carrying
   a supply of "cold" material to dump the heat into runs into trouble
   due to the sheer *amount* of heat you have to get rid of. You\'ll
   have used up the capacity of any portable unit in a very short time.
4. EM signature, mostly light. At a bare minimum. you have to let in
   light at the eyes so the wearer can see where he is going. Hard,m
   but not impossible to detect at higher tech levels.
5. mass. The intruder *has* mass. And as such, he\'s *inherently*
   detectable. We *now* have detectors that can detect the mass of your
   fist at a couple of meters. Detecting a 100 kilo intruder at 10
   meters is quite doable. 

#1 &2 can be *somwhat* counteracted by using a regenerative breathing
system. Agian, this adds mass, but I recall seeing pictures of a WWII
re-breather setup that was good for multiple *hours*. Just pray it
doesn\'t break. :-)

Thermal and mass are your big problems. Anti grav *isn\'t* (by all
accounts) neutralizing mass. It\'s generating some sort of counter
force. So it\'d likely make you *more* detectable.

Frankly, if you are trying to spy, rather than break in to steal some
object, you\'d be much better off with micro-drones. Essentially, tiny
computer controlled fake insects. They fly or crawl in, acting like
normal insects. Only that thread of spider silk the spider is laying
down as it travels (quite normal!) is actually a fiber optic cable. 

Given a variety of drones and a few hours, you may be able to
infiltrate them into much of the desired area, and have the microscopic
fiber cables carrying data undetectably out to some point where they
can safely beam it to you.

Of course these drones are just as vulnerable as normal insects to many
anti-insect measures, and every time someone dusts, it\'ll wipe out any
surface fibers. 

Still this ought to be quite common in a couple of tech levels.

Look up "date rape". There are several drugs that are popular because
they not only knock people out, but they also tend to wipe memory for
as much as several *hours* beforehand. And at least one definitely
interferes with forming long term memory for a while after the victim
regains conciousness.

Bzzt! Sorry, wrong answer. You don\'t get to decide what the word means.
What it is *defined* as is believing that there\'s no proof one way or
the other. Which makes it theanswer returned by applying the scirntific
method.

What you\'ve defined is essentially Deism or Theism (different sources
give different spellings). The belief that there *is* a "God", but that
beyond that, you aren\'t willing to go. Pretty much my position.

It\'s a rather common viewpoint, but most folks confuse it with agnosticism.

Agnostics (A=no, gnosis=knowledge thus "we don\'t know") aren\'t sure.
Theists are. So are Atheists.

Well, let\'s whip out the OED.  Maybe it\'ll do better than when I 
tried to look up sabotage.


> The english call them brollies and gamps.

My OED does not not have an entry for brollie, but I\'ve heard it used 
for umbrella.  There are a number of entries for gamp, which support 
the umbrella notion:

 - an umbrella, especially one tied up in a loose, untidy fashion.

The meaning comes from a character in a Dickens novel, a disreputable 
nurse (which is the first entry), who carried such an umbrella.


> What is a busby?

 - a tall fur cap, with or without a plume, having a bag (generally 
of cloth, and of the colour of the facings of the regiment) hanging 
out of the top, on the right side; worn by hussars, artillerymen, and 
engineers; hence, one who wears a busby.


> If you were born within the sound of Bowbells you\'d be a:?

 - Bowbells are the bells of Bow Church (St. Mary-le-Bow), in 
Cheapside, London (so-called from the \'bows\' or arches that supported 
its steeple).  This church having long had a celebrated peal of 
bells, and being nearly in the centre of the City, the phrase \'within 
the sound of Bow-bells\' has come to be synonomous with \'within the 
City bounds\'.  [by \'City\' they mean the City of London - edjs]

On a low-law level world there are going to be *severe* penalties if
your skill isn\'t up to the job. I\'d say that some sort of
"certification" would give you a bonus on the roll to see if your

Actually, if you stop and think about it, what you wind up with is a
plane containing the *line* that connects both ships. Movements
*normal* to that line define the plane. movements such as your
"corkscrewing" become *rotations* of the plane, which can in essence be
ignored. 

To rephrase that last bit, motions that move the ship neaerer of
farther are "along the line" (X-axis). Movements towards/away from the
line in one direction become the Y axis. And movements along the
"z-axis" merely *rotate* the X-y plane.

Maybe not. It may actually be *easier* figuring stuff in the "rotating
plane" than in true 3-d. My math ain\'t up to it.

Well, Ba seems to me to be a special case. *Who* do you plan on trading
*with*? With a population *that* low, you are essentially going to be
negotiating with an NPC, whih means that the trade tables go right out
the airlock.

You mean like the time some students at Sylea Tech (Or was it their
arch-rivals at Vland Institute of Technology [think MIT vs CalTech])
disassembled a small cruiser while the crew was on leave and
re-assembled it inside the domed sports stadium?

Or the time VIT students reprogrammed the AI proctors for midterms at
Sylea Tech to give all the tests in Old High Vilani?

Trust me, reading up on some of the things the students at CalTech and
MIT have done will give you *more* than enough materials for your games
(and, possibly, for your nightmares).

Another interesting field for speculation would be the exploits of the
Imperial Agressor Corps. These are the folks who keep the Imperial
forces on their toes by doing everything fro being the OpFor (Opposing
Force) in wargame scenarios to doing unannounced tests of base security
and unit preparedness.

The US has several groups like this. One of the ones in the Army used
to refer to themselves as "32nd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment" which for
those of you not up on such things, is a *Soviet* style unit
designation. 

I\'m informed that back in the "bad old days", both the Air Force *and*
Navy got nailed in a combined op. The Aggressor corps "borrowed" some
B52s, painted red stars on them and *wave hopped* them into San Diego.
It\'s been a long time since the Navy guy who\'d been there told me about
this, but I seem to recall something about flourbombing headquarters...

You can *imagine* what the Imperial equivalent would be like. I expect
that a lot of them woud be Army/Navy/ or Marine folks who\'d later
transferred to the Scouts. It takes that kind of crazy outlook to come
up with the right sort tactics, and to pin-point the things that the
"by-the book" types may have overlooked in their security.

DS stands for "discarding sabot". Basicly, you have a thin "dart" in
the middle of a lightweight casing or "sabot" (french for "shoe").
Think of a normal rifle cartridge having the bullet replaced by a
plastic (or alumin) bullet. Now split that bullet lengthwise into 2 or
three segments, and have a small hollow in the middle were a finned
"dart" sits. The segements are the sabot, and hold the dart centered in
the bore. They also allow the expanding gases from the poweder to push
evenly on the dart (sort of like the wad in a shotgun shell).

When you fire the riound, the powder creates gases which push on the
sabot, accelerating it down the barrel. Because the sabot+dart weighs
less than a normal bullet it goes faster. As it leaves the barrel, they
sabot is free to seperate from the dart, and does so. That leaves you
with a faster *thinner* projectile heading for the enemy.

Thinner means both that it pentrates better and that it loses less
speed top air resistance.

The "danger zone" is from the sabot segmenbts which don\'t go too far,
but do tend to spread out a fair bit from the barrel. It\'s dangerous
being in in a conical area extending from the barrel, because while the
*dart* may miss you, the sabot may well hit you.

In order:
Predictability: Add a fuzzy-logic program so the drone will do some version 
of Y, rather than Y itself. Have top-flight programmers rewrite the battle 
code frequently on the carrier so the enemy has trouble linking X and Y.

Messing with the Programming: A dangerous problem. Use good cryptography, 
possibly hardware based. Put big thermite charges hooked to anti-tamper 
booby traps on every computer on the Drone, it would be bad if the enemy 
got their hands on one. Also hook these anti-tamper charges to a radio 
switch - send it the right code (a single-use throwaway cipher, very hard 
to break) and it goes boom. This radio switch would\'nt be hooked to the 
onboard computers, so a hacker who got into the programming couldn\'t stop 
you from knocking out a wayward Drone.

Computer gets Scrambled and Attacks a Civilian Target: Recall the earlier 
thread about IFF problems - would friendly-fire or fire against neutral 
targets be more of a problem with Battle Drones than with manned Fighters?

The biggest expense in today\'s military aviation isn\'t the plane, it\'s the 
pilot. It takes a lot of black-box hardware to replace a pilot, but you 
have a lot of money to spend on black boxes if you aren\'t paying for the 
flyboy. If the tech level can handle it, you\'ll see computers flying combat 
missions.

Imagine the political backlash the first time a Battle Drone suffers a 
computer or control error and kills a free trader with full passenger 
load...I can imagine cultures that wouldn\'t allow their militaries to use 
Battle Drones after a single such incident, or even after realizing such an 
incident could occur.

Think of it - two cultures in conflict, one only uses manned craft, the 
other uses Battle Drones. The advantages the manned craft have will, of 
course, start to fade with ultra-high tech levels...

Manned Craft: better command control, less predictable, much better able to 
adapt to unusual circumstances. Much higher chance of having a player 
character piloting a ship. :)  Lower G tolerance, fewer units available.

Battle Drones: Higher G tolerance, faster reaction time in simple 
situations. More of them (due to the lower expense per unit). Support 
facilities more complex, more vulnerable to jammed communications. 
Predictable.

I see a band of heroic PC\'s and NPC\'s in star fighters facing a horde of 
bot-brained Battle Drones, and making like Colonial Viper pilots against 
the Cylon Armada. They might need bigger ships just to fit all the kill 
markings on their hulls - but the baddies will always have more Drones to 
send into the fray, allowing the GM to keep the fight going as long as it\'s 
fun.

Hmmm....come to think of it, command/control link limitations in the Battle 
Drone fleet could keep the baddies from putting all their Drones in flight 
at once. The GM could therefore keep sending wave after wave of Drones, no 
single wave enough to overwhelm the PC\'s - kind of like the way bad guys in 
a Kung-Fu movie come at the hero one at a time....

It isn\'t a matter of trading TO a barren world, there isn\'t anybody to sell
to. Its a matter of selling goods FROM a  barren world. The reason I\'m asking
is for a spreadsheet I\'m working on that calculates profit margins between
worlds.

Most of that can be done with a little extra weight at the same tech level.  The
problem with the "invisible man" suit is that its uni-vectored optical camo.  The
man standing in front of the wall will disappear if you look at him from one
direction.  But if you look at him from 90 degrees, he sticks out like a sore
thumb. In those cases, its better to go with good general (or reprogramable) camo
rather  than "perfect" copying.

I don\'t know about T4, but TNE clearly states that no stat may be increased

Well, don\'t the decays follow a bell curve?

If so, there\'ll be a definite concentration. The trick is if they have
a means *besides* relativity of controlling the half-life  of the
particles. Then by combining relativistic effects *and* a "chosen"
half-life, you can get however many sigmas you want of the bell curve
*inside* the target!

Damn! I just realized that it won\'t work. Unless I\'ve made a mistake,
the closer to C you get the *wider* the peak gets. I need it to get
*narrower*.

Then it happens in a *cone*, with the apex at the meson gun. And the

No. Unless the mass of the planet is a *significant* fraction of that

how far out the planet is.

If you have the diameter of a planet, the volume is:

	V=(4*pi*r^3)/3

Where V is volume, R is the radius of the planet (both in the same kind
of units, ie if R is in km, then v will be in km^3) and pi is 3.1415926...

The density is simply the mass divided by the volume . To be able to
get a *useful* density figure you want tyo use meters for the radius
and metric tonnes for the mass. With that scale water =1, iron =7.8, etc.

That\'s why I said that the "typical" radio/phone is likely to be a
table-top set, not a pocket one. With electronics, size and ruggedness
aren\'t directly linked. A pocket sized unit is apt to be as rugged as a
desk sized one. But the larger unit lets you use discrete
sub-assemblies, which make it possible to *repair* the larger unit
rather than *replace* it. Sure, it ups assembly costs some (and in fct,
can be shown to lower reliability! That\'s why you see surface mount
stuff instead of socketed. The sockets were failure points!). But in
return, you can get a half-trained tech to repair it by swapping
modules until he finds the bad one. 

Mechanical stuff will follow a more definitely "Russian" design. 

Ther satellites in orbit will require folks with spacecraft to service
anyway, so they\'ll just be standard. In fact, I expect that they\'ll be
*so* standard, that it\'s easier to just make sets based on *major*
population breaks, as you need so many to get minimal service, that
the extra capacity isn\'t a problem. That is whether the local pop is
ten or a billion, you\'ll need 50-80 satellites. Past that, you start
looking at more advanced satellites so that you don\'t need more of
them. 

At around 100k credits for all 80 satellites (at TL9 costs!) it\'s not
worth the trouble of simplifying them for the lower population.
Especially since by TL-11 or 12 it may cost more to *deploy* the
satellites than to *build* them.

Hi Leonard.  It will work.  

Sure, I\'ve always envisioned the decay pattern as a bell curve.  some
mesons decay at the m-screens, lots decay inside the target, and some
decay on the far side of the target.  The end result would look like
a pulse of light passing through the target, with its intensity
peaking at target center.  Bang.

For MGs, the SOM established that nuclear level tinkering does occur
with mesons.  The only real reason you need them near c is for simple
sped of delivery.  Of course you may need to reach some level of
time delay relativistically so the meson decay "clock" will be
effective.

Maybe you don\'t need such enormous energies.  In any case, this seems
like an engineering problem not a physical one.

Doesn\'t seem to apply to T4 however, as it is very common to end up with 
characters maxed out on EDU (as a previous discussion/flame fest pointed
out.) 

Also, is the highest starting SOC in TNE an 11? It can go up to 12 in T4
(2d6).

Oops! Just happen to notice on page p 15 of T4 that character stats can range
from 1 to 15. Funny how these little things slide right on by you even after 
repeated readings....  :)

I would hazard a guess that either the rule has been missed or was cut out during

All of the stats are 2d6-1  in TNE.  Hmm... now that I look that up specifically,
additional rules allow a SOC of 15 (F)... of course it also points out that the
SOC tells you what your parents or guardian\'s social standing is.  And as I\'ve
pointed out in my games, A hard vacuum cares little who your father was.

Well, I guess thats it then... Check again for that 2 point increase rule. And
look for that -1 on starting rolls. I wouldn\'t think they\'d change that from
system to system. Probably a typo.

However TNE doesn\'t count SOC as an attribute, and clearly says that it can
change dramatically, the only limits being 1 and 15.

Adushirga (Vilani Good Luck Charms)

These small good luck charms originated on Vland, although adornments of a
similar nature were (and in many cases are) common in a number of eras on many
different worlds.  Two things set them apart from the rest, however.  They
have a very specific traditional meaning, and are common in all corners of the
Imperium.

The origins of the Adushirga are lost, although they most probably date back
long before the Ziru Sirka.  Adushirga are small charms, usually made of
plastic, each with a small ring at the top that is made to be strung on a thin
bracelet or necklace.  They are collected and worn (or sometimes carried in a
pocket, especially among older teenagers and adults).  The practice is
believed to stem from an ancient Vilani belief that you should pass along a
little good luck to someone who has done something nice for you.  Somewhere
during the history of the Vilani people, this belief manifested itself in the
practice of actually giving a small charm to an individual who has done
something nice.  The charms come in a variety of shapes and colors, and as the
practice became more widespread in the Imperium, the good luck symbols of
other cultures were appropriated as well.  The original symbols are Vilani in
nature, and are still quite common.  The average person doesn\'t know where
those symbols (or many of the other symbols) had originated.

There are many purely Vilani symbols, the following is a sampling of the most
common:

- - a coiled worm (popularly believed to be the adushiruu worm which is common
on Vland)
- - an old Vilani symbol for "happiness" (appearing something like a Solomani
"pi" sign with the addition of a shorter middle leg)
- - the smaller offset circle within a circle symbol of the Vland and the Ziru
Sirka

A large variety of symbols have Solomani roots, here is a short list of them:

- - an upside-down \'U\' shape with knobs on each terminating stroke (a Solomani
symbol, either originating from their horseshoe design or an ancient character
known as "omega")
- - a leaf with four parts (an extremely uncommon mutation of a Terran plant
none as a "clover")
- - the stylized Solomani heart-shape.
- - a serpent-like shape with small legs, based on a mythical "dragon"

The Imperial Starburst is a symbol that is pretty commonly seen as an
adushirga, as are the good luck symbols of local cultures.

Cool, but I think that a reasourceful player could get around this.

I would have to say so.  Just think the SW use some Battle Drones & they
get scrambled & attack a 3I free trader.  Would this not start a war?

I would have to say that with most humans anti-robot bias, I can see while

I can see a war.  Think a Zho BD attacks 3I shipping inside 3I Space.  What
do you think would happen?  A war.  Heck this could be the start of a great
game.  The Zho & 3I intelligance working together to stop a war that a
fringe group wants to start.  A great way to show players that either the
3I or Zho are human too.

Interesting stuff, but it doesn\'t give an indication of what occupation 
fits into what class.  Where do soldiers fit, for instance, or 
mercenaries?  Are pilots more highly thought of than teachers, or doctors?

I really think you\'re going to see 2 stage sub-orbital "vans" in the next
few years.  Use an airplane for the first stage to boost the piggy-backed
"van" up to a few kilometers.  Then the Van separates and uses rockets to
boost above the atmosphere.  The van lands at an airport halfway around the
world using small jet engines.  I\'ve seen proposals that give
intercontinental ranges.

I think the piggy-back approach will be the first *commercial* step,
followed by SSTO.  Hasn\'t FedEx had an outstanding RFP for a
intercontinental vehicle that can fly within some cost range for several
years now, or is that another urban myth?

Yeah, I agree.  If DynaSoar and MOL had been followed up on, the space race
would have continued in LEO even after the Russians bowed out of the Moon
Race.  IMO, the only thing that has kept us from *really* "bustin" out into
space has been a lack of perceived competition.  After all, the Moon Race
was more for National Prestige (and how it affect national security) than
anything else...at least to the politicos.

I hope so.  I *think* so, but I don\'t think NASA/government is going to
make the breakthrough.  It\'s time for commercial interest to come into
play.

You know the saying, "When it\'s time for trains, somebody will build
trains.", right?  ;-> IMO, it\'s getting close to "time for trains" in
regards to inexpensive ground to leo technology.  Heck, the concept has
been on ABC/NBC/CBS nightly news in the last few months, in one form or
another; businessmen are talking about commercial ventures that will
require low-cost G/LEO in business articles in the Wall Street Journal; and
the concept of the need to protect ourselves from earth crossing
asteroids/comets is beginning to penetrate the national (even world)
psyche.  I\'m being optimistic today, must be in my manic cycle ;->, but I
think the "next big thing" is going to be the commercialization of low
earth orbit.

The commercial interests might not start out with that in mind.  They will
be looking to put up hundreds of *really* cheap satellites for
international cell-phone, video, data communications, and will have to have
low-cost G/LEO service.  They will be looking to offer same business day
continental and next day intercontinental package delivery service, and
will have to buy into low-cost G/LEO systems.  On the heels of this
ventures will come tourism, with first sub-orbital flights, then Orbital
tours that will require a Space Hotel. 

Within ten years, unless there is an economic depression, within twenty if
there is...IMO.  At least, I hope so!

That\'s all highly dependent on culture.  To borrow from Battletech, clans think very
highly of their mech pilots.  Of course lawyers could universally be classed at no
better than 2 :)

Their skins would get quite hot, that\'s for sure, but I don\'t think there
would be a long waiting period before they cool down, and besides we\'re
talking about a turnaround of several hours, maybe a day, not thirty
minutes.

>Does not the SpaceShuttle need to cool down after landing, in order  for a

Could be, but I thought that was due to possible hydrozine in the
atmosphere around the shuttle. IAC, the Shuttle is 1970\'s technology and I
suspect we could do considerably better today.

THe ZSGG is a running gag in some of the campaigns I participated in over the
years, originating in the old Star Trek TV show where Spock says" I
instinctively used the Vulcan Death Grip." 

I would get in some tight spot in D&D or Cthulhu or SHadowrun or whatever, and
announce that I was using the Something Something grip, tailored to the
individual situation. Gradually it came to be accompanied by an impromptu
explanation ("Well, you let your thumbnail grow real real long, and..." "Well,
it involves a rubber band the size and shape of a Cheerio, which is placed..."
"You take a linoleum knife and..." "Teeth and claws are used to..." 

The actual details were never revealed, sad to say...they are best left to the
imagination anyway.

Given some of the background information we have, this
compartmentalization isn\'t totally surprising: the Vilani
discourage innovation and independent exploration, and encourage
rote learning and doing things in a specified way because "it\'s
always been done that way".

This led me to consider the world view of these xenophonts. I wanted to 
give them something in common with humanity, a basis for communication - I 
was surprised when the answer came to me so easily. More on this at the

These creatures communicate and reason in a completely analog fashion - 
their color-whorl presents a complete concept all at once, all the levels 
of the concept a coherent whole. When two or more communicate, their 
changing whorls interact quickly and at complex levels - what looks like a 
band of aliens standing like statues is an intense conversation, argument 
or debate.

Since one of these xenophonts is so aware of the world-view of others, they 
do not see themselves as being complete individuals - they are 
self-directed, but their awareness makes it relatively easy to understand 
another, know what another will do.

As they only fuzzily see themselves as discrete individuals, so is their 
concept of One somewhat limited - quite simply, the idea of things being 
all one thing or another, one or zero, on or off, is very difficult for 
them. Some of them can handle and work with the idea, as some humans can 
handle differential equations, but the average member of this race will 
neither understand nor see a need for the concept - even though (as with 
differential equations) the benefits of such understanding could be 
extreme.

So, here we have an alien race that thinks almost entirely in analog terms. 
I\'m trying to understand them, develop them for a complete write-up...and 
I\'d love some input. How would this worldview affect their scientific 
development? Their dealings with humanity? I\'ve got some ideas, but I\'d 
like to bounce this idea around a little before I set it down.

Oh, yes, the common ground with humanity...it struck me that these 
creatures would be astounded by something we do every day. All their 
communication is presented as whole concepts, you know where someone is 
going as soon as they "speak". But when a human talks, she can present a 
series of words that go in an unexpected direction - this amazes them. I 
think we call it "telling a joke".

Ideas welcome...I haven\'t even named these critters yet...

Lumbering and impractical, this is one of the strangest creations to grace
a battlefield. Born in the fevered imagination of an early inventor,
possibly inspired by stories of high-tech warfare, this early tank pushes
past the limits of practical technology. 

A wheeled large box, armoured in stout ironwood and driven by
muscle-power, the Davincii serves as a mobile artillery platform. Although
it is impervious to small-arms fire, it cannot avoid even heavy infantry
and so must be guarded at all times.

mix of passengers and cargo for short distances in relatively sheltered
waters. 

Virtually the entire cost of the skiff is its sail. In an emergency, the
woner will rescue the sail and let the hull sink.

Low tech worlds still depend on technology, and the people who keep it
functioning. A housewife who\'s pot has sprung a leak cannot repair it on
her own; a farmer with a broken plowshare needs a blacksmith to weld the
pieces together. Small settlements cannot support dedicated workers, and
so rely on travelling technicians.

The tinker\'s cart is simply an enclosed box containing a small workshop
and space for personal effects. The driver\'s seat is outside, sheltered
from the elements by a small awning. The cart isn\'t fast, but neither is
the pace of life.

did I disable saving and printing? Well, aside from causing a few of the

version, and I discovered with CSC/Infini-V that people expect to be able
to import older data. 


Today I started work on the rewrite, which will clean up the code, make it
easier to introduce PC-compatibility, and all T4-specific features. i will
upload progressive demo version for comments


Information I need (so far) to make this version T4.1-compatible:

1) the finalized milieu-specific mods for world generation

2) the errata for T4 animal encounter table generation



PS. You folks owe Dom and Bruce a vote of thanks. CSC/Infini-V wouldn\'t
have shipped without their dedicated playtesting. Also, without the
concrete financial support of Kenji and Andrew I couldn\'t have considered
upgrading Metator.  Thanks guys.

Vision would be key in the biological makeup of these creatures. I would
venture to say their range of vision extends beyond our visual spectrum.  It
would also be interesting if they displayed what they thought.  This makes it
impossible for them to lie... or at least VERY difficult.

If their range of vision went into the UV spectrum (like bees) this would be
much easier as they have a wider bandwidth for communications. They would be
really good with visual data.

Or put it aboard a ginormous, aging liner...20 years ago there was a
terrible accident in the engine room, radiation spill, hull breach, 2nd
Engineer presume blown into space...but no, though hideously disfigured
and driven mad by pain and disorientation, he crawled into the ship\'s
little-used maintenance shafts and hull spaces, and survived...

:) Setup here could be a graduate of Sylea Tech, in town for the big
gravball game against crosstown arch-rivals Zhunastu College.  School
officials quietly approach him (and his friends) with a job offer, based
on his knowledge of the school and, ah, security issues.  Seems a war of
pranks is escalating between the two schools as the game approaches, and
the characters are asked to figure out what Sylea\'s game-day coup de grace
will be, and prevent it.  The Sylea grad\'s loyalties would be torn between
the desire to stop a bunch of kids from doing something criminally stupid,
and the desire to see his alma mater really score prank points against ZC.

__________________________________

Spaceship Combat in Megatraveller

(This system takes what I believe are the best elements of the SSCS, RPSSCS
and the Mega-traveller system in the Referees Manual.  Therefore some
credit goes to the designers of those systems for ideas.)

The Tactics Pools.

Tactics Pools are roving DM\'s which can be used on any task (by either
side) during any round of combat.  There are two tactics pools - the fleet
pool and the ship pool.  The fleet pool can be used for DM\'s on any combat
task.  The ship pool can be used on any combat task by or against that
ship.  If there is only one ship on a side these will be the same thing.
The fleet pool is equal to the total of one sides participants fleet
tactics.  The ship pool of a ship is the total of that ship\'s crew\'s ship
tactics (RB tactics = ship tactics minus 1) plus the current computer model
number of that ship.  A DM on any one task can never exceed +/- 8.

Ranges

There are five ranges in this system and they determine hit difficulty
profiles.  The ranges are:

Boarding (Very long or below)
Short (planetary or below)
Long (far orbit)
Out of Weapons range (Extreme Orbit but still in sensor range)
Out of Sensor Range (beyond Extreme Orbit)

A ship may not be at boarding range to another ship unless one of the ships
is disabled (unable to move).

1) Surprise.

Surprise is determined by the attacking side as a task:

To determine if the attacking side has surprise:
Difficulty, Leader, Sensor Ops (confrontation)
Referee: The task difficulty will depend on the exact situation involved
but is assumed by default to be Difficult.  On a failure both sides detect
each other.  On a fumble the defending side has surprise instead.

The benefit of surprise is that the side with surprise can have a round of
combat in which the surprised side may not react.  If surprise is not lost
then this may continue.  Surprise is lost by hitting a unit without
rendering it inoperative, activating active sensors or failing the
following task:

To determine if surprise is retained:
Difficult, Leader, Sensor Ops (confrontation)
Referee: Retaining surprise can represent the fact that an attack was not
detected or that the surprising ship has not been detected yet.  Play as
best fits the situation.

2) Combat Round.

a) Determine Initiative

Initiative is determined by rolling the following task for the PCs.

To determine if the PC\'s have initiative:
Routine, Leader, Fleet tactics (or ship tactics if only one ship)
(confrontation)
Referee: A marginal success (exactly 7 rolled after DM\'s) gives intiative
to the side with the highest fleet tactics (or ship tactics if only one
ship) skill.  If this is equal roll again.

b) Movement

Each ship on the side without initiative decides if it will close, maintain
or increase the range.  Each ship on the side with initiative then decides
the same.  Any ship without maneuver drives cannot move and fails all
movement tasks.  If the two choices are compatible then movement occurs.
e.g. if both sides decide to close the range then the range closes.
If the choices are incompatible then roll this task for the side with
initiative:

To determine the outcome of movement:
Routine, Pilot or Ship\'s Boat (as appropriate), Maneuver Drive Rating
(confrontation)
Referee: Success at this task allows the side with initiative to determine
movement for that round.  Failure allows the side without initiative to
determine movement for the round.

Multiple Ships: If there are multiple ships per side decide movement for
each ship seperately.  This will necessitate keeping records of the range
of each ship to every other ship.  Ships may operate as a squadron taking
the best pilot and worst maneuver drive rating in the squadron and only one
ships tactics pool.

c) Sensor Lock

Ships which lost initiative declare their sensor status (active or
passive).  Ships which gained intiative declare their sensor status.

A Sensor lock is automatically gained by any ship with a passive array on
any ship using active sensors.  Active sensors effectively light the ship
up like a lightbulb but make getting a lock to another ship easier and
retaining one automatic.

To gain a lock on to a ship which is not using active sensors is a two step
process:

To scan a ship which is not using active sensors:
Difficulty, Sensor Ops
Referee: The difficulty is the most favourable sensor scan difficulty level
from the unit\'s UCP.  There is a DM of -2 at long range.

To pinpoint a ship which is not using active sensors:
Difficulty, Sensor Ops
Referee: The difficulty is the most favorable sensor pinpoint difficulty
level from the units UCP.  There is a DM of -2 at long range.

General Notes on Sensor Tasks:
i) An EMS jammer prevents active sensors (including RADAR and LADAR) of
equal or lesser range being used for any task but allows an automatic scan
success for a passive array.
ii) EMM raises the difficulty one level for all passive array tasks
(neutrino sensors and densitometers work normally).

If a scan is obtained but not a pinpoint weapons may be fired at one higher
difficulty level.  If a pinpoint or scan is obtained with active sensors
the lock or scan is retained into future combat rounds provided active
sensors are used and the target remains inside weapons range.  If a scan is
obtained with passive sensors it remains unless the target leaves sensor
range.  If a pinpoint is obtained with passive sensors it is lost at the
end of the combat round.

d) Fire

One ship on the side with initiative fires first, then firing alternates
between sides until all ships have fired.  Firing ships may leave weapon
batteries in reserve for defensive firing at missiles (lasers only) or for
return fire (step e).  If a weapon has been used in defense it may not be
used in attack.

To determine if a firing battery hits:
Difficulty, Off: Weapon UCP, Gunnery, Range DM Def: Agility, Pilot or
Ship\'s Boat as appropriate
Referee: Range DM is:
	+1 for missiles at long range
	-1 for lasers at long range
	+1 for energy weapons at short range (cannot hit at long range)
	-1 for meson weapons at long range

The Difficulty of this task is Difficult at long range and Routine at short
range.

To determine if a hitting battery penetrates defenses:
Routine, Off: Weapon UCP, Gunnery, Def: Defense UCP, Gunnery
Referee: Missiles have an offensive DM of +1 vs Sandcasters.  Energy
Weapons have an offensive DM of +2.  The only possible defenses are:
	Sandcasters vs Missiles or Beams (energy or laser)
	Lasers vs Missiles
Each defense can only be used against one attack.

Damage is equal to the UCP of the weapon, minus 1 for every 3 full armour
factors above 40 (it is possible to score 0 points of damage) minus 1 if
hitting a target at long range.  Meson weapons ignore armour but damage is
reduced by 1 for every UCP of meson screen present.  Nuclear missile damage
is reduced by 1 for every UCP of nuclear damper present.  For every damage
point which penetrates armour scored above (disp/100) the weapon scores one
critical hit (Megatraveller Referee\'s Manual) and reduces armour by 1 for
each point (a VERY good time to use those Tactical pools...).  Damage is
rolled on the standard Megatraveller damage tables, with the change that
Weapon-n reduces the UCP of one weapon by n rather than destroying the
whole weapon.  Spinal mounts roll at +6 on the table, nuclear missiles at
+6 on the surface explosions table, pulse lasers at +2.

(NB: I use the damage descriptions from the RPSSCS to allow the PC\'s to
repair damage, cope with fuel leaks etc.  I have also changed die roll 6 on
the Surface Explosions table to \'Sensor-1\' which destroys one of the ships
sensors (active, passive, neutrino or densitometer).)

e) Return Fire

Return fire is conducted as step d) but allows any ship which was fired on
to automatically fire with a lock on to any ship which fired on it.  Only
weapons not fired during step d) may fire during this step.

I\'m giving them some vibration-sensing capabilites, but not a true auditory 
sense. To communicate with auditory/verbal creatures, these xenos will have 
to use a translator setup - I envisioned an artificial "eye" the critter 
wears around it\'s abdomen (where it can see it), a translator converts 
sounds into very, very basic color whorls. The xeno would probably speak 
through a vodor box of some sort.

True, but there is armour impregnable to certain weapons. Lasers are the
most effective weapon for small craft at combat ranges (30 000km and up),
and lasers are limited in output by TL. It isnt particularily difficult to
build a warship that will take only surface damage against lasers.

It\'s an interesting concept. See if you can make it work using FFS2.

Ian Whitchurch
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I was recalling how a bunch of ground troops with portable lasers took out 
some attacking spacecraft in Heinlein\'s _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ - As 
the spacecraft was on final approach, they washed the whole hull with laser 
weapons. Every sensor array on the ship was blinded, then burnt out - I 
guess the idea was that if it was sensitive enough to provide information 
to the ship, it was sensitive enough to be vulnerable to a laser beam. This 
gave the attacking spacecraft a choice, either surrender and have Luna 
Control guide it to a landing or fly blind and smack into something at a 
tiny, but still way too big fraction of C. I guess rolling down the window 
and sticking your head out to look around was unwise.

Made me wonder how easy it is to kill the sensors on a warship - force it 
to retire by blinding it. How vulnerable are radar, ladar, neutrino 
detectors, gravitometers and whatnot? Would the chance of inflicting such 
catastrophic blindness on a battleship be the best thing a fighter squadron 
could hope for, even be the mission they trained for?  Or are there so many 
backups (every turret with it\'s own emitter, for example) that completely 
blinding the ship is unlikely in a span of one combat? I recall The T4 
Naval Architecht\'s Handbook mentioning turret gunner positions located on 
the outer hull of the ship, to allow for visual targeting in extreme 
situations.

"Tango Leader, there\'s no way our laser cannon will crack that 
battlewagon!"

They could have a monocle arangement instead of an earpiece.  The spoken
language would be so imprecise.  The monocle could then receive vibrations and
translate them into images for the xenophonts to read.  The small area and
shorter bandwidth of the monocle works fine for the more imprecise spoken
language.  The big problem comes when the xenophont talks back.  Volumes and
volumes of their speach would come out with mere blinking.  This would give
them the reputation of being blowhards or eloquent speech makers, which depends
on your social standing :-)

I would imagine that the first contact with this species was difficult.  They
might be able to learn written language first and then rely on voice to text
data translators.

Regarding their world view, I think alot depends on whether or not there is a
hive mind. If they have a balkanized hive mind, then war would be rampant, just
like ant colonies.  If there is a unified world hive mind then war and combat
would be completely alien to them. They all understand everyone\'s point of view
so they can\'t get so much of a difference of opinion to fight.  That\'s not to
say they can\'t be violent.  If they are the predators of their world they might
be quite decent hunters and killers.  However military wise, weaponry would be
designed around hunting not mass destruction.

Their "shades of gray" mentality would make tech advancements very slow.
Focusing on one thing would be anathema.

I think they\'re doing that sort of laser blinding now.  But as far as disabling
sensors here\'s a "hand wave" defense measure.  You surround your ship with a
plasma field.  When a targeting ladar hits the ship, the plasma field
discharges down the laser, disabling the ladar.  I\'m sure there\'s all sorts of
problems with implementing this, but it does throw a little fear into gunners.

I don\'t picture them as much a "Hive Mind" as a race that understands each 
other very, very well - I imagined two of them looking at each other and 
exchanging information similar to what we\'d exchange with a good friend 
during an hour conversation, except that they could do it in a few seconds 
to any other xenophont.  I imagine their race\'s idea of consensus would 
make our Amish look like bar-room brawlers...and I wonder what kind of 
conformity standards would be common to these creatures.

As to tech advancements, this is the touchy one. Ever hear of the sci-fi 
story where Earth was invaded by musket-toting aliens? The idea was that 
our world view led to chemistry, metallurgy, physics, etc, while a slightly 
different world view produced a technology that was crippled in these 
fields but developed hyperdrive at around TL 3...are there fields where the 
analog views of these xenophonts would give them advantages?

I see them as possible diplomats - they start out intuitively accepting a 
connection between themselves and the sentient they are meeting with, no 
matter how alien.

I think that killing sensors is a legitimate "tactic" in most
iterations of traveller. I quoted out tactic because that level of
aimed shots usually doesn\'t apply, but the end result does.

In HG/MT, scrubbing surface features off the hull to soften a target
up for spinal fire was normal. I\'d say that had sensors been in the
mix, they\'d be toast, too. Any decent combat system should allow for
this, even if they aren\'t aimed shots (PCs are a special case,
though, they can aim where they want :-)

There will be numerous back up sensors on large military ships, but
these systems are extremely fragile and will end up getting knocked
out.

Fighters trying this would fire missiles, perhaps "shotgun" KKMs
that spread many (millions?) bearing balls at the target. Sure, the
dame will be small, but it could be effective. Don\'t drive your
torpedo boat (aka fighter) too close though, that\'s very dangerous
work.

No, I\'ve scoured the section on chargen word for word this time, and no
mention
either of a -1 on starting rolls or a 2 point increase rule. CT didn\'t have
such a
rule, and I would suppose that with T4 being described as an improved CT
that it makes sense that it wouldn\'t have it either.

Thanks for your assist! I never played and haven\'t seen *any* of the TNE 
stuff, so that\'s very interesting info for me!

Thanks, Marc! So PCs can go up to 15 in their stats still...good, saves a
little
bit of recoding there  :)

Non-Trav question: Would you happen to know who owns the rights to
the GDW game _Belter_? I have a project where I am converting the map
and counters to bitmaps to be used with the V_Map program, and would
like to get permission to post them on the V_Map web site. You and Frank
Chadwick are listed as the designers, did one of you get the rights when GDW
splashed, or did someone else assume them?

Thanks!

But don\'t fall into the cliche of near-perfect understanding leading to near-
perfect harmony. I imagine that two opposed xenophonts could exchange
vitriol and hatred for one another and each other\'s ideas in seconds that
might take us hours of impassioned argument. Can you imagine what kind of 
insults you can get across to the other person when an thought-whirl not only
carries your opinions on their ideas, but also where they can stick them, what
you think of their parentage, their country, their race, their breath, what
sort of
bizarre sexual peccadillos you believe they have, the fact that they eat corn,
etc., all in one message. Makes the Hollywood Drill Instructor look like a 
wussy!

I\'ve never read that story, but have heard the idea discussed on the TML
before and really do like the concept of alternative technology trees if you
will, where our discovery of electromagnetism and concept of it led to a
certain technology path, whereas a race that never discovered EM but in-
stead followed through on the concept of the Ether has an entirely different
technology available to them, and neither can really use the other\'s tech-
nology because discovering one precludes the other. It really fits the 
quantum idea of the results gained being dependent on the expectations
of the viewer into a cosmological view.

Sounds fine, I just am wary of the descriptions of other sophonts as 
fitting a type. Traveller tends to be as guilty of this as any other sci-fi
setting, Aslan are samurai with fur, Solomani are war-mongering 
xenophobic racists, etc. Just smacks to much of the "All Jews are...", 
"All Blacks are...", "Whitey always..." type of arguments you hear 
now, just blown up to a planetary scale. I prefer to *try* (though I\'m 
often guilty of it as well) and not group my aliens into homogenous
stereotypes.

Except the French and Vargr, of course, we ALL know what they\'re
like  :-)

But then this same tactic would make missiles literally obsolete, since
their sensors would have to be exposed to laserfire as well.  Hmmmm...

Visual sensors would be the only ones that would be particularly
susceptible to lasers, since they share a common medium (ie: light).
Perhaps some sort of fast acting, liquid-crystal shutters could be used to
protect the sensors long enough for a more robust defense to be activated?
Or maybe not :)

Things like densitometers and gravity detectors could be buried behind
protective armour, since I do not believe their proximity to the surface of
a ship is necessary for them to function.

The back-up sensors could easily exist inside armoured bays and only expose
themselves when needed.  Likewise, since lasers will probably use fixed
frequencies to deliver damage, "filters" may exist by TL12+ that can act as
"armour" against a particular frequency while allowing others to pass
through unhindered.  Such filters would have to be easily replaceable,
since one hit would do enough damage to make seeing through one impossible
anyways (but the sensors themselves would survive).

    To be honest, the B-52s, while capable of launching cruise missles,
were not dropping smart bombs.  They were carpet bombing military targets.  

    If the building next to the ammo dump doesn\'t get a scratch, then it
wasn\'t much of an ammo dump.

     You aren\'t helping.  Paula used to (and may still have) as part of her
act, her explaination that she just doesn\'t understand all the hoopla about
this sex thing.  It just doesn\'t do it for her.

ob-trav:  The goals of the typical Traveller adventurer don\'t match up with
the average imperial citizen.   They commonly echo the feelings of one
Bilbo Baggins when approached for an adventure.

So if Sayat have red skin, use reindeer, and are Communists, does this
mean that Santa Claus is actually a Sayat agent trying to undermine
capatilism by flooding our economy with free Christmas presents ?

> Could you run Ine Givar and SolSec past the Telorans, too?

Ine  = 9 + 14 +5 = 28
	2 + 8 = 1

Givar = 7 + 9 + 22 + 1 + 18 = 57
	5 + 7 = 12
	1 + 2 = 3

	1 + 3 = 4

So they are obviously significant.

SolSec = 19 + 15 + 12 + 19 + 5 + 3 = 73
	7 + 3 = 10
	1 + 0 = 1

Thus we can see that while the Templars may control the Ine Givar they
do not control SolSec.  it seems likely to me that the Templar
controlled Ine Givar are using the Ine Givar to stir up trouble & commit
acts of terrorism to increase popular Imperial support for high levels
of Imperial military presence in the Spinward Marches.  The Spinward
Marches contain Five Sisters Subsector which is, as we all know, the
mystical center of the known universe.  No doubt the Templars want lots
of ships present to control this area.  The question we need to be
asking ourselves is are the Templars trying to protect us from the
unspeakable Lovecraftian horrors which will soom break free into this
dimension or are they merely trying to be the dominant power in the
region so that _they_ can decide who to sacrifice, in hideous ways, to
these monsters ?

Don\'t ever let anyone tell you that it is just a lucky astrographic
coincidence, combinded with hard work on Norris part, that The Regency
was able to avoid Virus.  Obviously something within the Regency is so
horrible that even Virus dared not go there.  

"Since we have proven that SolSec, and thus the Solomani government that
it is the puppet master of, is not controlled by the Templars we have to
wonder which branch of The Conspiracy is controlling the Solomani. 
Obviously it is the Bavarian Illuminati.  Did you ever wonder _why_ the
Solomani rebelled ?  Canonical sources claim that it was due to
"cultural differences".  I will now reveal the extent of these "cultural
differences".  The Solomani wanted to print their own money with the
traditional design of their secret masters, the Eye in the Pyramid, on
it.  The Templar controlled Imperium could not allow this because this
would mean that every cash commercial transaction would rip a little
power from the beings conducting it and transfer it to The Bavarian
Illuminati.

 (Did you ever wonder why the ZHodani have strong psychic powers and
the  Hivers have noe (or so they say) obviously the design of Zhodani
money creates a positive feedback loop for psychic powers while the
design of Hiver money creates a negative feedback loop for it.  More
proof of the fact that Zhodani psychic powers are caused by the mystical
nature of their money system can be seen in the fact that it is the
Zhodani upper classes, who have and handle more money, who have the
psychic powers)

Therefore the Solomani rebelled.  After rebelling the Solomani Sphere
created its own money with, naturally enough, the Eye in the Pyramid on
the back.  The Imperial government was busy at this time fighting off
other mystical attacks and could not respond until The Solomani Rim
War.  In 1014 shortly after the conclusion of this war thee Imperial
government redesigned the credit.  Ostensibly this was done to reduce
the possibility of counterfitting the them TL 14 credit with the
superior technology of the emerging TL 15 worlds but I think we know
better than that."

     It was also a case of the Army lacking the infrastructure.  The Army\'s
helicopters and light aircraft don\'t require long runways.  Not only would
they have to maintain the aging aircraft, they would have to build new
runways, and maintain them.

Don\'t know if you got all the answers yet (I think I saw the first two
correctly answered), but these are they in case they\'ve been missed:

1) A brolly is an umbrella and fairly common usage; my dictionary gives
\'gamp\' as an umbrella too but I\'ve *never* heard this used.  Nor have I
read Dickens\' _Martin Chuzzlewit_ from where it\'s supposed to come.  (Mrs
Sarah Gamp)

2) A busby is tall fur hat that you might be familiar with from the guards
at Buckingham Palace.  (I confess to not knowing that it had a bag hanging
on it\'s right side, nor that the word\'s possibly from the Hungarian).

3) If you\'re born within sound of Bow bells you\'d be a Cockney.  (And in
theory then have a \'peculiar\' English accent and a rhyming slang all your
own!)

Hope this helps, hope you win.

The croosrange is limited by the need to keep the skin temp down. As I
recall, they wanted to avoid really exotic materials, so the max hull
temp is under 1000 degrees. The hull titanium. It\'ll cool pretty fast
on the way down from airflow.

Also, *being* sub-orbital, they reach orbital *altitudes, but not
orbital *velocities*. So they won\'t get as hot to begin with.

Nope. Instead, what they need to do is pump a lot of cool air into the
Shuttle *or* get the crew out fast. The outer hull isn\'t very hot, but
the shuttle itself has no means on *internal* cooling after it lands
(nor any power!)

Same problem. You are either obtaining the trade item *yourself* or you
are cutting a deal for it with what amounts to an NPC.

To put it in perspective, name me a "trade item" from a land mass on
earth that qualifies as "barren".

Reminds me of the quite common scene where a "bad guy" goes into a room
where a captive is being interrogated, carrying a teaspoon. Horrible
screams are heard, and he emerges with the info.

I finally ran into a book where the author explained the use of the
teaspoon. It was pretty obvious in retrospect, but still good for a
shudder. And no, you\'ll have to figure it out on your own!

As I recall, the goal for turnaround time is an hour. They have
modified the designs somewhat to go after a prize that requires
re-flying the ship the same day (possible within a fixed *small* number

Imperial, but the government has done a bang up job of making most people

It\'s handy when you have to recruit in hurry.

But the sheer volumes of communication this race performs on a daily basis indicates a consensus culture to me - not to say that they don\'t argue like cats and dogs, but when (or if) time comes to take action they know how everyone stands on the issue - they wouldn\'t proceed unless they were confident that no one in the group was dead-set against the project, and they\'d know that just by looking.

Doesn\'t need to, as it generates a field that can cover minor extensions
such as turrets and aerials.

That\'s a possible explanation.

Personally though, I\'ve always liked the idea of freighters that could
increase their tonnage by dragging non-volatile cargo\'s in huge "jump-nets"
behind them.

Also useful for salvaging ships with inoperative jump systems

Nice story effects.  Might be worth it for that alone.

I suggest you guys look up the term "Personal Area Network" or "PAN"
at MIT or on the IBM Systems Journal site.

This is _real_ technology that exists today, that uses the body\'s
bio-electric field as a network media to communicate between various
computers on the body, and to other people\'s PANs.

Systems are powered by a piezo-electric generator mounted in the heel
of the shoe.

The demo application has two people exchanging electronic "business cards"
by shaking hands. 

Not "Production Strength" yet, but certainly "on it\'s way"

That really drove home the third dimension element, especially
to a boardgamer used to being able to form impemnatrable lines
of battle as in most WW]{ boardgames and Diplomacy.

You just _couldn\'t_ form lines. You could only defend your
star-gates as best as possible, and hope the enmemy attacked
them. If you split your forces to defend individual systems,
you would be defeated.

Ok, generally I will reiterate, the stealth suit is not suitable for
Imperial assassinations, Robbing the Imperial Bank of Glisten, or, more
generally, evading high tech detection equipment.  It is suitable for
low-key grey operations like breaking in to offices, home, forest compunds,
all at night in relatively low security situations.

The Suit I was describing is also a relatively simple spandex unitard, not
an armored suit with backpack power supply and helmet.  If you want that,
make your own, and be sure to discriminate it in name from this item.

The problem with equipment in Traveller is that game balance must be
retained.  If, in actual use, I gave the people I play with the
capabilities some responders have mentioned the Galaxy wouldn\'t be safe
anymore and all my adventures would be walkovers.

Wave cancellation is a proposed sonar defeating technology, but in that
mode would require enormous amounts of equipment and energy.  There are
also engineering problems associated with the very first second or so of
transmitted signal; it is "impossible" to get a cancelling signal back to
the source within the first few moments.  This problem would be multiplied
with a detector that was frequency agile.

More likely is a sound absorbing material, similar to the radar absorbing
material on stealth aircraft, which simply tends not to reflect the sound
waves.

The throat mike issue can be solved a number of ways, including a mike
designed to transmit (and clear up) subvocal noises, which would be easy to
dampen.

[snip]

I knew of this tech, but thought the suit was significantly heavier/bulkier
than what I was envisioning.  Just the implications of a "Chill Can"
contradicts my picture of a device which is mostly passive in its
effectiveness.

It does seem a reasonable variation on the theme though, based on the 2 kg
weight.

[snip John\'s TL/Camo option description.]

I like your descriptions, but would tend to move them up a TL (TL16 for
blurproofing, TL 13 for variable camo settings, TL 14 for automatic camo
settings, TL 15 for Chameleon Coating).  The item described is relatively
available on the civilian market (assuming a low law level or special
contacts).  The Military only version is one TL ahead.

Remember that for every detector there will be a counter.  That\'s exactly
the point of this item.  Also, the item is pretty much limited to
non-military and/or routine levels of security rather than being
invulnerable to all sensors at any tech level.

Since the outfit is optimized for a completely different purpose, I would
not allow this interpretation by my players.

I\'m not sure what you are saying here, respiration occurs through a simple,
noise suppressed, mask.  Heat exchange is via the air-permeability of the
fabric.

the suit.

In answer to your list.  Yes, all of these methods can detect this item, as
well as psionics, air pressure/movement, odor, sensitive sound detectors,
The suit is not *that* capable.  Against the mark 1 eyeball, and mark 1
ear, it is excellent.  Against a chemical or biological sniffer when the
scene is being investigated, it does pretty well.

Against electronic detection equipment the suit is only better if the suit
is a higher tech level than the equipment.  This is, perhaps, overstated.
Perhaps a situational example would be in order.

Harley Quinn in her jester-style stealth suit is trying to creep through a
warehouse attic ("Sneak, sneak, sneak."), without attracting the attention
of the roomful of gangsters just below.  She has stealth-1 and a 12
Dexterity, giving her a 13 or less target on three dice (based on the
difficulty, whose names I never remember).  With her TL 12 stealth suit she
gets a +4 bonus (+1 for each TL over 8), bring the target number down to 9;
that\'s pretty easy.  A failure and the gang downstairs hears something, but
might even ignore it or laugh it off.  A catastrophic failure nad she steps
on a loose panel and drops into the room below, with an embarrassed look on
her face.

Now put a TL10 ultrasonic burglary alarm in the attic.  The bonus is now
only +2 (diff between TLs) and the difficulty is one level higher (3.5 d6
rolled).  Target number is now 11, but on more dice.  A somewhat more
difficult task.

Change the detector to a TL 14 IR detector and she\'s in real trouble.  I\'d
use the same difficulty, but if I rolled the 50% chance and find the
detector is specifically designed against the suit\'s defenses, only a
spectacular success would keep Harley from setting the thing off.  Even if
the other 50% is rolled, the suit gets a -2 on stealth rolls since its two
TLs lower than the detector; mind you, without the suit the person wouldn\'t
get a roll at all (or a critical success only roll), so this is still an
advantage.

>Frankly, if you are trying to spy, rather than break in to steal some
>object, you\'d be much better off with micro-drones.

There are times when there is no substitute for human eyes and ears, and
some times when there is a need to enter and remove something.
Surveillance equipment has its (very important) role, but its not always a
substitute for an operative on the scene.

Always remember folks, I plan to let *players* have this thing.  I gotta
leave a few sensors around that can detect them.

I never understood that.  Surely the most effective tactic is  to
send in covert special ops teams to  neutralise  planetaty  meson
guns prior to invading?  (Similar idea to Han Solo taking out the
planet-based shield generator in Return Of The Jedi.)

Hmm.. just trailing of Five Sisters is District 268.

I don\'t think that there would strict classes for each occupatuion.  Since
we have the Cr. 250/month per point of SOC rule back, if you get a high
paying job, your SOC will rise as you maintain a higher lifestyle.  For
example, a doctor who was born dirt poor (SOC 3) but makes enough money to
maintain SOC 10 will be SOC 10 after a time.  In a similar vein, a SOC 9
businessman who loses everything won\'t be able to maintain appearences and
his SOC will fall.

They are ;-) That is why missiles are so easy to kill. Regardless of
how much you might want to armor a missile, its sensors can\'t be,
and need to be pointed right at the target.  That is why det-lasers
make sense since they try to detonate at a range far enough out that
they haven\'t been hit yet.

KKMs will have a lot of trouble for this reason. Basically if your
laser can wreak a sensor, it can kill a missile. This is why it is
so hard to do a roll back attack in traveller--lasers can kill
missiles faster than a moidern warship can with missiles.

I don\'t mean to somehow overpower the detector, I mean to pysically
destroy it. The same laser will punch a hole right throught a
person, it just won\'t be able to drill through a few cm of BSD.

The gains in service are related to being introduced and peer pressured

My new character - Dr Martin Gigglesborn - Grand Admiral Retired has a

he has a certain circle of influence. A few other Admirals may owe him a

An old character - Jim Staines Sector Admiral has a social of B, this
relates to his knighthood.  During play his social increased from 2 to 4

The way I solved it in my universe was that the Meson is actually named
after Robert T. Meson, discoverer of a fundamental particle which decays
after an exact proper time interval.  This decay is not because of the
usual QM energy uncertainty, rather, it is because of an internal clock
that causes it to switch states.  It has three important states -
interacting, non interacting, and decaying.  The name similarity to the
presently known particle, which decays according to QM principles is an
unfortunate accident of history, and can be blamed on his aggressive patent
enforcement team.

When it is in the interacting state, it can be easily generated, unlike,
for example, collimated neutrino beams.  These have been suggested as
useful for similar purposes as Meson beams, yet the difficulty of
interacting with them via the weak nuclear force has thus far made them
more a laboratory curiosity, while Meson beams are used for all sorts of
purposes once they become well understood at TL 12.  The state change
requires a significant amount of energy, though nothing like the
mass-energy of such a particle, and requires information about the
particles quantum state which is near to the theoretical limits, which is
why it is so difficult to harness them before nuclear damper technology is
well understood.

Meson screens work by causing them to prematurely switch states to the
decay state, where they turn into a flood of gammas and other particles,
and by causing them to switch to interacting state, which allows you to use
redirect them easily without harm to your vessel.  As tech level advances,
Meson screens become much less power hungry, as they need a far shorter
range.  Low tech meson screens produce the same explosion and flood of
gammas that the gun was trying to produce, just outside rather than inside
the target.  Higher tech screens allow redirection without an explosion.

Being on the outside of a meson screen equipped facility is not very
pleasant at TL 12.

damage for each round, or for the burst as a whole?  How do you
determine where each individual round goes?

2.  What are the effects of being hit by HEAP rounds?  Are there

HEAP rather than having a pierced set of armour?

Either way would be the basis for a longer campaign. How does it all

Problem with 2D-2, in addition to the 11-point range, is that it yields a
bell curve distribution.  Realistically, we want a 10-point range with
equal chances of each result.  To avoid the heretical ten-sided-die, we
need that old double roll:

Throw 1D.  On a 1-3, the multiplier is 1D-1 (reroll 6).  On a 4-6, the
multiplier is 1D+4 (reroll 6).  I don\'t remember if they had that in Book
6, but I\'m sure it was in MT.  This is the D6 equivalent of a D10.

Actually, we need a 1 to 9, zeros don\'t work...So using 2 six sided dice we can use
this formula
Die 1:
1-2: Add 0
3-4: Add 3
5-6: Add 6

Die 2:
1-2: 1
3-4: 2
5-6: 3

Pop Mod = 3 x (ceiling(Die1 / 2) - 1) + ceiling(Die2 / 2)

of course, if you\'re going to use that fomula, you may as well roll a virtual 9
sided die.

Then  there is a population density question.  A billion people on a size A desert
world is going to be alot more sparse than a billion people on a size 1 water
world.

Oops!  That\'s right.  The tenth point is accounted for by the population
digit itself.  No wonder there was a problem.  :)

If we introduce grav focusing technology, it would be applicable to
any particles that couple via gravitons, so I feel that this might work.

Also, considering the idea of grav focusing.  If you can generate a 
soliton that encompasses and accompanies the laser photon packet to
its target all the way, I\', not sure it would have to have a very large
strength to counteract beam divergence.

After all, light, light everything else, falls at 9.8 meters per second
squared in a 1g field.  It just doesn\'t stick around too long.

Thoughts anyone?  All my physicist buddies?

My rule is that it takes several months of spending to raise the social

If you believe in the concept of "game balance". Personally I don\'t. Any
dynamic system has a point of balance. It is up to a referee to work out
what that is, and put the setting near that point. If it isn\'t near that
point of balance, then the universe will move toward that point. For
example, if it were possible to build suits that made people virtually
undetectable, then the balance point would be a sort of universe where
everyone knows what everyone is doing. Subterfuge is achieved through
either information overload, or else misdirection. If a referee doesn\'t
portray a setting like that the characters will work it out, and use it.
Then the NPCs will catch on and the world will slowly move towards the
point of stability.
It isn\'t that the Galaxy wouldn\'t be safe, just different.

This comes down to tech-versus-tech. Higher tech ultrasonics will just
modulate it with increasingly complex functions that take longer for a
countermeasure to mimic. Higher tech conutermeasures will just get faster
and mimicing the modulation, etc, etc.

>Wave cancellation is a proposed sonar defeating technology, but in that
>mode would require enormous amounts of equipment and energy.
There is no reasons it should (at higher tech levels than us) if you can
just modulate the reflection. I think the problem with current systems is
they have to sync out the whole signal which  means you need something as
powerful as the transmitter. (And I really can\'t see how it works if you
have more than one detector.) If you have a "smart-surface" you can do it
just by changing the reflectivity of that surface with no needed boost to
transmit. Of course, you have to ask yourself if just adsorbing the damn
signal is easier to begin with.

Another point that doesn\'t seem to have been taken up (or I just haven\'t
seen) is that we don\'t have to shoot for 100% here. Like anything that
_helps_ fudge detectors is better than pole vaulting in singing the star
spangled banner. You are not necessarily trying to defeat the sensors.
Maybe just the imagine recognition software behind it. If the sound of your
footsteps can\'t be completely silenced, maybe it can be made more like the
wind in the trees outside. At least to the background noise screening
software.
[Which is why I agree with Pete when he says "There are times when there is
no substitute for human eyes and ears."]

>More likely is a sound absorbing material,
There is another alternative [which I originally used to explain
invisibility in D&D!]. Imagine that you had a suit where each point on the
surface was, actually, a small fiber optic wire connected to the
diametrically opposed point on your other side. If you stood infront of
something the light from behind you would "shine through you" out the other
side. Some inevitable distortion, of course.
Of course, you need something a little more clever than fiber optics (which
would only work for light hitting at right angles), but with polarised
filters and clever re-routing it should be possible at a slightly higher
tech level.
Nor is this technique limited to visual. You could also pass through low
level sound or ultra-sound (see recent developments in solid-state
speakers), IR, or whatever. This might also form a clever way to dump your
excess heat. You analyse the IR that is passing through you and add your
own IR (or a portion thereof) in with an appropriate dispersion so as to
fool most detection software.

>I knew of this tech, (IR adsorbtion) but thought the suit was
significantly

>in its effectiveness.
I wouldn\'t have thought so. It is just a dump for the heat. Imagine you
have a web of superconducting threads woven into the suit (but "insulated"
so as only internally radiated heat was channeled) terminating in an
ice-cube (or lump of liquid nitrogen) you have stuck into your heel. It is
still essentially passive, you are just re-routing your heat elsewhere.
When you get out of the danger zone you can vent the excess heat (eg, the
boiled off liquied Nitrogen).

>BIG problem. The person *has* to be able to sweat.
Why? If they are cool enough, which they would have to be if it is IR
proof, why should there be excess sweat? (Other than the nature of any
inherant danger in the task!) In any event, if the suit is air-tight,
that\'s going to hold in any excess DNA traces. The residual sweat can just
be pooled in adsorbant material. (Ever work out how much a sanitary towel
holds?)

>working on detectors to pick up the microgram amounts of the *enormous*
>number of volatiles a huan (or other animal/plant) body gives off
Again, it is tech versus tech. Making it air tight gets rid of most, except
expelled oxygen (the design does not call for your own air supply). For
that you just have filters that, the higher the tech, remove more and more
trace remains. Of course, in step, detectors can detect higher and higher
traces. Now once you get good enough to be submerged in the background
level, it becomes more having more "image recognition" like software to
work out when it is being fooled.

>I\'m not sure what you are saying here, respiration occurs through a
simple,
>noise suppressed, mask.
What, I beleive, he is saying is that instead of having a single outlet for
the air, it is dispersed through the entire surface of the suit. Think of
the suit like a baloon. Instead of letting all the air out through one
orifice (no wisecracks please), imagine instead you had little holes all
over it. That way you don\'t get any strong air currents or so forth. It
shouldn\'t be that difficult to do if the surface is permiable to it at that
level. You just work it so the whole suit in permiable at a low level and
also filters out unwanted.
Of course it will need some dry cleaning job at the end of it all!


  Heat exchange is via the air-permeability of the
fabric.

>you have several ways the wearer can be detected:
>1. oxygen consumption (difficult, even at high tech levels)
Just stick a LOX ice-cube in your cheek (metaphorically). How big a cube
would you need for a 15 minute supply? Double it up with the heat
supressor.

>2. CO2 emmissions (easier)
Just need a high-tech catalyst that bonds readily with CO2.

>3. thermal signature.
See above.

>4. EM signature, mostly light.
See pass-though system above. But, if you don\'t like that, how many
detectors have you seen that operate via light? Other than the rather
obvious spy-beam alarms, or the camera-monitored-by-security-guard, what is
there?

>5. mass. The intruder *has* mass.
A densiometer with the modulator put in backwards? :-)

Which is all you need 90% of the time. I\'m sold.

I have a character in a high-tech (non-Traveller) campaign like that. She
has a bevy of "flies" which usually fly about her sending back telementry
so she can "see" 360 degress for a hundred meters or so around her. Too
much of a headache to pay attention to most time but once her attention is
drawn, she has the recon she needs.
But, much as my character in Pete\'s campaign is one to sit on the ship and
do _everything_ via the computer, remote sensors, and heads up displays,
there really are times when it is best to actually _go_ somewhere. It _is_
the only way you can be sure that you are getting real data and they don\'t
just have a wonderful countermeasure.

>Always remember folks, I plan to let *players* have this thing.  I gotta

Don\'t worry Pete, that\'s what the ferro-crete grenades are for. Didn\'t I
mention those?

Well, a truncated cone, but considering the ranges meson guns operate at,
the volume swept out be as close to a cylinder as makes no difference.
Assuming the decay happens along something like a normal distribution, we
can offset the beam from the center at a normal distribution to get maximum
intensity at a single point and decreasing effect further from that
point... Close enough to spherical to a first approximation.

I started thinking of real-world gelding techniques, and remembered that
the Saami use their teeth.  Since they\'re reindeer pastoralists too, I
think it only appropriate the Sayat should do the same.  All low-budget

Strange... there was a SolSec hatchetman NPC in the last Traveller campaign
I was in who, in his menacingly swishy way, would do _exactly the same
thing_ with a lace antimaccassar his grandmother had made.

Milieu 0 tells of a booby-trapped security robot that killed a foreign
delegation before the founding of the Third Imperium. IIRC, the Shudusham
Concord prohibits automated lethal weaponry precisely because of this and
"Battle Drones" would only be used by enemies of the Imperium during its
early era.

Hey, hey, hey!  Siberia and Mongolia hardly qualify as "barren"!  There\'s a
good 50+ million inhabitants of the first, and 2+ of the second, with an
assortment of light and heavy manufacture as well as agriculture, animal
husbandry, and resource extraction, all of which are export-oriented

**History**
The Luriani are a Human minor race transported to their new home by the
mysterious Ancients some 300,000 years ago. Whilst the Luriani are
unmistakably Human they have several unique and distinct characteristics
which are a result of both natural evolution and genetic tampering by the
Ancients. The Luriani are often referred to as "aquatic" Humans. This is not
strictly true, for although they are far more at home in a water environment
than most Humans these adaptations do not go as far as the Solomani geenered
Scanians. Luriani have distinctively webbed hands and feet (and the Luriani
toes take up a far greater proportion of the feet); certain fat cells have
the ability to store oxygen which allows the Luriani to remain submerged for
up to 30 minutes and reach depths of up to 500 metres without any artificial
assistance; they possess a clear second eyelid under the first which greatly
enhances their vision underwater. However perhaps their most striking
modification is not readily apparent at all. Unlike virtually all other
Human races, the Luriani are overwhelmingly right brain dominant and their
language ability is located in the centre of the brain which normally deals
with singing rather than the classic speech centres. It would appear that
these modifications were introduced to enable the Luriani to function better
in a three dimensional environment, this has lead to further speculation
that the Ancients intended to make the Luriani fully aquatic but the Final
War intervened, leaving the Luriani "unfinished". As a result of these
modifications the Luriani are overwhelmingly (at least 93%) lefthanded,
intensely creative and artistic, and have a strong tendency towards music
and other performance arts.

Derri (the Luriani homeworld) is officially classified as a waterworld, with
only 5% of its surface being land. However this is still 19.7 million km2.
Derri is a fairly normal world with eleven continental plates, but these are
mostly below sea level. Thus Derri is covered by a large number of
continental sized island archipelagos surrounded by shallow (150m to 300m)
seas. These "continents" are surrounded by deep (2000m to 5000m) oceans. It
would appear that the Ancients initially deposited the Luriani on several
islands in one of these archipelagos.

The semi-aquatic nature of the Luriani enabled them to utilise the shallow
seas around their island homes for hunting and gathering, thus allowing for
far greater populations and development than might have otherwise been
expected. However eventually the restricted nature of their island homes
started to limit their development. It was these growing pressures that lead
to the development of seafaring on Derri far before the Luriani had even
developed anything even remotely like civilisation (it is theorised that the
creative nature of the Luriani brain played a crucial role in this). Thus in
approximately -250,000 the Luriani developed seagoing vessels whilst they
were still a primitive hunter gatherer society. By -150,000 the Luriani had
developed oceangoing vessels capable of circumnavigating their entire world
despite still possessing only a TL0 culture. It was the possession of this
maritime capacity which preserved the remarkable homogeneity of Luriani
culture, despite being separated by thousands of kilometres of water, each
Luriani settlement was connected by a web of voyaging ships. Indeed some
Luriani lived out their entire lives at sea, only setting foot on land to
gather supplies or build new ships.

Given this voyaging culture it was only natural that the Luriani should
quickly come to the concept of trade and commerce, thus giving rise to the
first signs of Luriani civilisation. By -100,000 the Luriani had developed a
thriving world spanning barter economy, with the huge nomadic voyaging ships
travelling between islands, trading for goods and services. However with the
rise of trade came the rise of piracy and warfare. Both the seagoing nomads
and the island dwelling settlements found a need for fighters to defend
against the depredation\'s of raiders, which would eventually evolve into the
Luriani warrior class. Thus by -30,000 the Luriani had established a world
spanning trading civilisation complete with organised warfare, despite the
fact that they were still a TL0 hunter gatherer culture without any
domesticated animals or form of agriculture.

Over the next 23,000 years the Luriani gradually improved their technology
and culture. In around -28,000 the first signs of agriculture appeared on a
number of islands, animals were domesticated around -25,000, metalworking
was achieved around -15,000. When Vilani influenced traders contacted the
Luriani in -7500 they had advanced to a solid TL3. The Luriani were to prove
to be extremely adept in absorbing Vilani technology; and by -7200 they had
achieved TL9 and were launching their first "voyaging" ships to the stars.
By -6000 they had established a vigorous interstellar culture encompassing
most worlds within 10 parsecs of Derri. However the Luriani never developed
the idea of an interstellar state (much like they have never truly developed
a worldspaning government) and their worlds remained a loose grouping
closely bound only by their voyaging culture. However this situation was not
to remain.

In -5400 the Vilani began the Consolidation Wars. Initially the Vilani
ignored the Luriani, regarding their independent worlds as a lesser threat
than the many organised interstellar states that they faced. This was to
prove to be a miscalculation on the Vilani\'s part. When in -4900 the Vilani
attempted to conquer the Luriani worlds they found themselves opposed by a
coalition of all the Luriani worlds. The initial Vilani offensive was turned
back with heavy losses. However the Vilani returned in greater strength and
thus began the Luriani Campaigns. The Luriani were to prove to be formidable
opponents for the Vilani. The nature of their brains made three dimensional
combat second nature to the Luriani and their warrior class were very
efficient fighters. however eventually the superior economic weight of the
Vilani began to tell and one by one the Luriani worlds fell to the advancing
Vilani fleets; and in -4500 Derri fell and the Luriani were defeated and
despite several revolts were to remain under Vilani rule until the coming of
the Solomani in -2200

When the Vilani conquered the Luriani in -4500 they attempted to impose
their culture on the Luriani; Vilani governors were placed in control of
Luriani worlds and the Luriani were expected to conform to Vilani cultural
norms. These efforts were less than successful, though the Luriani did
remain firmly under the control of the Vilani, their culture remained
largely intact, the Vilani were never able to stamp out the emotional and
independent nature of the Luriani. Thus when the Solomani arrived in the
Fornast sector in -2223 they were greeted as liberators by the Luriani and a
number of Luriani units served in the Terran forces during their final drive
on Vland, proving that they had lost none of their fighting abilities. With
the final defeat of the Vilani in -2219 the Luriani expected that the
Solomani would restore their independence. However they were to be sadly
disappointed. Unlike the Geonee or Suerrat, the Luriani were not granted
autonomy under the Rule of Man. Naturally this bred resentment with in the
Luriani and in -2186 the Luriani rebelled against the Rule of Man. What
followed was a tragedy for the Luriani. Isolated with only a limited
production base, the Luriani faced an alliance of both Terran and Vilani
forces. The Luriani hoped that the other minor races would come to their
aid, these hopes proved futile and the Luriani were gradually worn down and
in -2180 their final stronghold fell and in a cruel turn of fate, the
Luriani again came under Vilani occupation. However under the Rule of Man,
Luriani art and music found a wide audience amongst the Solomani; and this
lead to widespread sympathy for the fate of the Luriani. Finally in -1932
Empress Juliana established the Luriani Cultural Region. With this the each
individual Luriani world was granted internal self rule, answering to a
Solomani planetary governor, with the entire region under the control of a
military governor general.

With the collapse of the Rule of Man in -1776, the Solomani governor general
of the Luriani Cultural Region found herself isolated and vulnerable.
Admiral Martinez solved her problems by reaching an agreement with the
Luriani. She transformed the Luriani Cultural Region into the Luriani
Protectorate. Under this compromise her fleet provided protection for the
Luriani in return for support, while the Luriani worlds were allowed to
retain their independence. The Protectorate continued to exist into the Long
Night; the Protectorate gradually evolved into a unique government. The
Solomani provided the much needed skills to administer a large scale
interstellar government, whilst the Luriani provided the necessary support
facilities and their warrior class came to dominate the Protectorate fleet.
Eventually however the Long Night claimed the Protectorate, by -1200 the
Protectorate fleet had dwindled to just a handful of vessels and contact
between the worlds had all but ceased. In -1183, Protector De Valine
acknowledged that the Protectorate could no longer defend the Luriani
worlds. The Solomani settled on the Luriani worlds and the Luriani
Protectorate succumbed to the Long Night.

The situation remained unchanged until the coming of the Syleans. The Sylean
Federation Scout Service reached the Luriani in -19. The arrival of the SFSS
reawakened the Luriani\'s desires for the stars, Derri had been able to
retain TL7 throughout the Long Night and the Solomani still remained a
distinct cultural grouping. Given the prod of the Syleans arrival, the
Luriani applied themselves to regaining the stars. It took the Luriani just
30 years to recover to TL9 and begin to reestablish the Protectorate. By 32,
the Luriani Protectorate was a thriving interstellar community once more,
encompassing most worlds within 5 parsecs of Derri. The Protectorate was a
curious state, one which the new Imperium found hard to understand or deal
with. The bulk of the population were Luriani by culture, but virtually all
the higher levels of administration were provided by the Solomani
"Protectors". Eventually the Imperium was forced to do something about the
Luriani. Initially they tried to incorporate the Luriani through diplomatic
means and initially this appeared to be a making progress, but negotiations
stumbled on the Protectorate demand to be allowed to retain its identity
within the Empire. In 79 Emperor Artemsus launched an offensive aimed at
incorporating the Protectorate. Once again the Luriani proved to be masters
of three dimensional warfare, in 84 the Imperial fleet suffered a sharp
defeat at the Battle of Gusashka and was forced to withdraw. It was now
clear that it would be a formidable task to incorporate the Luriani through
military means. In 85 a peace settlement was negotiated and the Imperium
returned to more indirect methods. From that time on relations between the
Protectorate and the Imperium remained strained, with many minor clashes
between Protectorate and Imperial forces.

**Physiology**
Unlike most known Human races, the Luriani are a discrete species (Homo
luriani) and are not interfertile with other Humans. However significant
portions of the Luriani genome were utilised by Rule of Man geneticists in
the "construction" of the Scanians, thus the Luriani are interfertile with
this branch of Humaniti.

Physiologically the Luriani are unmistakably Human, but they do possess a
number of unique identifying physical characteristics, however these
characteristics are only apparent on a close physical inspection. The
Luriani posses a transparent second eyelid which protects their eyes from
pressure and irritants, as well as acting to improve their vision under
water. They possess muscles which can seal the inner ear, protecting it at
extreme depths. They naturally produce a number of body oils which protect
them from cold and irritants. Both their feet and hands are webbed. However
their most notable adaptations are the fat cells they posses which store
oxygen. This allows them to collapse their lungs and reach far greater
depths (around 500m) than other Humans, as well as permitting them to remain
in an oxygen free environment for up to thirty minutes.

However, distinctive as all of these characteristics are, the most
remarkable modifications to the Luriani. The most remarkable and influential
adaptations in the Luriani are found in their brains. At least 93% of all
Luriani are right brain dominant and their language centres are located in
the regions of the brain more usually associated with music and singing.
These modifications, coupled with their close ties with the aquatic
environment have produced the distinctive features of the Luriani culture.

**Culture**
Luriani culture is strongly influenced by the right hemisphere dominant
nature of their brain. The Luriani are a creative, passionate and artistic
people. The usual Imperial stereotype of the hotblooded Luriani artist does
in fact have some basis in truth. Luriani music and art frequently reflects
the emotional tension that lies beneath the surface of their society, few
Humans can fail to be at least slightly affected by the pulsating up tempo
bass rhythms of Luriani music, even more so when coupled with the sensual
nature of Luriani dance. However, as with all stereotypes, this ignores the
vast sweep of Luriani culture.

Many outside observers characterise Luriani society as being communal; in
fact the Luriani are very strongly individualistic, but they utilise a form
of group marriage in which a number of adults will form a distinct family
grouping. Any children born into the family are regarded as brothers and
sisters and all the adults will regard them as their children. As a result
of the this, the universal Human incest taboo is slightly altered amongst
the Luriani. It is accepted that some "siblings" will form relationships
with their "brothers and sisters" during pubity. Such relationships are
discouraged, but they are accepted as long as the children do not share a
biological parent. However the relationships between the adults within the
family are in a constant state of flux.

The Luriani believe strongly in individual and family honour. The Luriani
code of honour evolved as a mechanism to limit the negative effects of the
Luriani\'s emotional nature. Luriani honour holds that effort and intent are
far more important than actual results; Luriani mythology is replete with
stories and examples of heroic failure. The three basic tenets of Luriani
honour are: protect your family; offer hospitality to all who seek it; and
treat your foes fairly. Unlike many other honour codes, the Luriani code
does not feature a physical duelling element, rather matters of personal
honour are settled by "contests". In a contest, the two parties will attempt
to complete some task or demonstrate mastery of a skill, usually artistic.
As long as both parties have made given their best, their is no stain on
one\'s honour for loosing such a contest. When it comes to warfare, the
Luriani hold that this is a matter for nations and tribes, not individuals;
thus war does not remove a Luriani\'s obligations on a personal level, even
when serving in the military.

**Art**
Art is one of the most important elements of Luriani culture, outside of the
Protectorate art is the most widely recognised aspect of their culture.
Luriani art reflects the turbulent and restless nature of their society,
very little Luriani art can be classified as static, the essence of their
art is the movement and energy found in their culture. The most prominent
Luriani art form is of course music, but they are also drawn to most other
performance arts (dance is almost as widely practiced as music). Other art
forms such as painting and sculpture are less common, but none the less are
still considered to be noble and honourable professions.

Luriani music is distinctive and unique, the most obvious defining
characteristic is its 10/8 time signature. However it also possesses a
number of other very distinctive characteristics. Virtually all Luriani
music makes extensive use of the voice as an instrument; and slight
differences in Luriani physiology has resulted their vocal cords being
longer than the Human norm, contributing to the strong base tendencies in
their music. Luriani singing also features a secondary voiced note when
inhaling in addition to the usual note when exhaling, leading to a
distinctive "breathy" sound (this effect is remarkably difficult for
non-Luriani to reproduce, lacking the Luriani\'s internal independent oxygen
source).

**Fashion**
Traditional Luriani clothing and appearance is almost as distinctive and
powerful as their music. Many have likened their fashions to those of the
Vargr. Traditional Luriani clothing is light weight and lose fitting;
intended to simultaneously functional and sensual. Luriani fashions are
intended to be provocative and revealing, whilst maintaining a sense of
mystery. The concept of utilitarian clothing which does not serve this
purpose appears to be entirely alien to the Luriani, thus all Luriani
clothing has to be serve this dual purpose (the Luriani were scandalised by
the Solomani and their "sack-like ship suits"). Luriani fashions do not use
muted or subdued colours, their clothing features many irregular blocks of
strong discordant colours with sharp dividing lines between them. These
blocks swirl and interlock, giving a sense of movement and energy. The
intention of the designer is to draw attention to certain parts of the body
and away from others.

Generally I approve of your desire to stick to six-sided dice only, but
there are exceptions. The population multiplier is one such. Far better
to just say: "Generate a number between 1 and 9 with an equal chance of
each". Or if you insist on sticking to six-siders, have a "white die,
red die" table like the ones in the word generation tables and put each
of the 9 digits in 4 of the cells, yhus:


White	Red die
 die	1	2	3	4	5	6

  1	1	1	1	1	2	2

Edmund Blackadder III: "Baldric, an eternity with Satan and all of his demons
will be more enjoyable to you than five minutes with _me_ and this pencil!"

Two of my favorite "we have ways of making you talk" scenes both come from
Raiders of the Lost Ark:

Scene A) Marian, threatened by sadistic Nazi with red-hot poker: "I\'ll tell
you everything you want to know!"

SNw/RHP (continuing to advance towards her, whispering, barely able to contain
his excitement): "Yes -- I know you will."


Scene B: Marian captive again (that happens a lot in this movie) Sadistic Nazi
shows up again, removes his trenchcoat, hands it to an aide, and then takes
out a horrible-looking device with chaines and hooks and Nasty Bits(tm) all
over it. SN makes three quick motions with his hands, and turns the device
into a travel coat hanger, which the aide uses to hang up the SN\'s trenchcoat.

Great stuff, one spine-chilling, one funny as all get out, and they use the
first to set you up for the second. Kasdan was a genius.

are you going to put in the rules how long it takes to raise SOC by

Hardly. A captive government is one that is imposed from outside. It need
not be a repressive government. If it is one imposed by a (comparatively)
benevolent society on a previously repressive society it could have all
aspects of a liberal society except for free elections.

First Empire.  Enjoyed  a revival among the Solomani of the Easter
Concord from -800 to -400.
    Glas rod pictures are made by stacking very thin glass rods of
varying  colours to create patterns.  The rods are tightly clamped
in  a frame to prevent shifting and displayed in front of a clear,
white light.

The  most common form of glass rod pictures are the loose pictures
described above. Once an artist has created a picture,  a computer
can  analyse  the  pattern  and direct the creation of duplicates,
each in one sense as genuine as the original.
    Another form is the FUSED picture.  Once the rods are in place
the  artist apply strong heat in measured amounts to fuse them to-
gether.  Part of the effect comes from the merging of the rods and
these  pictures  are  very difficult to copy.  A third form is the
FUSED  IRREGULAR  picture.  Although  glass rods are produced in a
large number of colours, some artists achieve even subtler nuances
by  using  rods of irregular lengths.  Such a picture is virtually
impossible to copy.

I had in mind to use a famous glass rod picture as a clue in a tresure hunt,
but I never got around to writing the adventure. Here is the entry about the
goal of the hunt:

"PRIDE OF THE RIM":  Legendary  treasure ship which disappeared in
- -1690  and has since become the object of numerous fruitless trea-
sure hunts.
    When the bankrupt Rim Province went into voluntary liquidation
in -1690,  the planetary governor of Gashurzid (Solomani Rim 2602)
organized a coup.  He commandeered a 1.000.000 T ore transport and
renamed  it  PRIDE OF THE RIM.  He  thereupon  through a number of
manouvres of spurious legality contrived to have it\'s holds filled
with  precious  metal ingots,  state-of-the-art electronics,  rare
pharmaceuticals,  precious stones and other valuables, topping off
with  the  cream  of more than 2000 years worth of accumulated art
treasures looted from the top museums of the world.
    Escorted  by  a  squadron  of 2nd Empire cruisers he then left
Gashurzid en route for Terra.  But on the second jump PRIDE OF THE
RIM  failed  to  appear  at the other end.  The escort immidiately
organized  a search of the surrounding star systems,  but no trace
of the PRIDE was ever found.
    As  none of the identifiable parts of the cargo have ever been
seen again either, it is generally believed that the PRIDE suffer-
ed  a misjump,  and that it and its vast fortune is still drifting
around  somewhere  in  interstellar space.  PRIDE OF THE RIM is to
this  day  a  popular  bait  amongst  confidence tricksters of the
Solomani Rim.

A question and two comments:

What would SL 1 equate to?

I don\'t know if it is any use repeating this -- I guess it depends on
whether you\'ve seen my previous postings on the subject  --  but there
is IMO something wrong with a system that distinguishes between 10
different levels of non-nobles and then lumps all non-imperial nobles
from the equivalent of a European baron to the equivalent of Napoleon
into one social class. I realize that such is more or less inevitable
if you only have 15 social classes to play with and want to use 5 of
them for Imperial nobility and 10 for non-nobles, but what I don\'t
understand is why it is necessary to stick to 15 classes. You\'ve already
broken the principle that all stats must be reducible to a single
hexadecimal digit with several other stats (planetary governments and
ship sizes to name but two). Indeed, it\'s _already_ broken WRT social
levels by the Archdukes and the Emperor, although that will not affect
PCs much. I\'ve previously proposed extending the system to 33 classes
with the Imperial nobles occupying the levels from 24 to 33 and the
levels from 12 to 22 used for the the minor, planetary nobility. This
could be done without changing the Character Generation system at all;
you\'d merely change the interpretation. No longer would PCs have an
excellent chance of winding up as Imperial nobles, but IMO that is an
added bonus; while it is possible to device adventures for characters
with more clout than Napoleon or to come up with a handwave to explain
why an Imperial duke dosen\'t have much clout at all, it is damn difficult.

This rule has the advantage of simplicity, but that is IMO the only
advantage it has. It is both broken in itself (Think about it: the
difference in cost of living between the two lowest levels of society
is 100% while the difference between two adjacent high levels is 10%
or less; if that had been reversed it would make a lot more sense) and
not compatible with the costs of food and lodging given in CT (and T4).
Starvation level is Cr150 per month and subsistence level is Cr450 per
month. But average, ordinary living can be had for Cr600 per month (This
is based on the assumption that roughly the same amount of money is used
on food, lodging, and basic necessities). You\'re having a Middle Class
person using Cr1750 per month. Average food is Cr200 and average lodging
is Cr200. That means he is using Cr1350 (the equivalent of somewhere
between US$2700 and US$4000, right?) on clothes and basic necessities
and entertainment. Does that sound right?

A much better approximation is that it is just possible to keep up a
lifestyle appropiate to one\'s SL for SL+2 time 50 credits per month,
with people usually spending SL times 10% more if they can afford it
(a small table would be sufficient to make it clear).

There are a few new titles that requires explanation: Freeholder was a
leftover from the days of the Sylean Federation. It was never awarded by
the 3rd Imperium and by the time of the Collapse there were only four
remaining freeholders. Consequently most people had never heard of the
title. Scion was a title given to the children of Imperial princes and
princesses who didn\'t have another title of their own. The children of
scions were not automatically Imperial nobles. If, for example, Paulo III
had not given his brother Asan a dukedom, Asan would still have been a
prince, but his daughter Cassir would have been a scion and her daughter
Margaret would not have been a noble (Though in practice both Cassir and
Margaret would almost certainly had marrired high nobles). As it is, they
were both duchesses. Since most Imperial princes and princesses did
recieved fiefs of their own or married nobles, the title was never used
much.

I put in freeholders, scions and senior dukes so that even if a referee
didn\'t want to abandon the official 17 classes of Social Standing, he could
still use the ideas by simply halving the numbers (rounding up). That would
cause Imperial nobles to have the correct Social Standing according to the
official system. (It would be necessary to device some new way to roll
Social Standing for PCs and NPCs, since the minor nobles would occupy the
levels from 7 to 11, so if SS was rolled with two dice, you\'d have a society
with more than half of the population nobles.)

I would agree with that as well. Word would get around, and the PC may
get invited to higher class party\'s, but his social will not rise unless
he wins approval. Likewise the business person may be able to sustain
his perceived station for some time after going down, but only as long
as he can keep up the front. Yes or no ??

Right.  I will, however, take the position that it is significantly easier
on the GM to keep the capabilities of any device \'down\' to a \'reasonable\'
level to prevent the chronic problem of not being able to think through all
the implications of a particular device with the same diligence of a
player.  Within that realm there is still a lot of capability and
imagination allowed, but the tendancy to rely on \'super-tech\' rather than
brains and ingenuity (and I admit the line is blurry there in places) can
be reduced to an extent.

I also get bored/tired of continual \'tech versus tech\' battles that Jo
mentioned.  It makes no sense for a small private Import/Export company on
a TL9 world to have advanced TL14 anti-burglary sensors (unless of course
they are a Zhodani Secret Safe House), hence any such company office is
\'wide open\' to PCs with a stealth suit of the \'over the top\' type.  In the
game balance scenario where the suit is super-capable, I need to come up
with a rationale for that small company to have advanced anti-burglary
equipment, any such rationale seems far-fetched at a certain point, since I
also don\'t want every criminal walking the street to have one of these
things.

Other problems arise when you admit that the same technology can be applied
to cars, guns, spacecraft, etc.  Hey! why not make a bag out of the stuff
to put guns in to smuggle through customs?  Or how about an invisible
grav-maserati zipping around the city?  The potential implications can
be...a strain on the imagination beyond the usual ones.

Hmm, How is this different (aside from being a more complete explanation of
the how) from the chameleon option?  It seems to  me that the chameleon
covering at its highest TLs is measuring light from all directions and
\'changing its spots\' in the diametrically opposed direction to match.  Of
course, the chameleon coating would lose out in certain situations, like if
it were directly between the observer and a very bright source like the
setting sun/star.  Perhaps you fiber-optic like idea would be more up to
that.

I know you\'re going to tell me its all EM energy, but I would think it
would take something different to handle the visual vs audible spectrum of
EM energy.  Hence I feel the ultrasonic defeating strategy and the visible
light defeating strategy would need to be different.  strategies for light
and UV, IR and other nearby bands could be the same though.

Current Traveller examples of this technology are mounted on battle dress.
We have no closer example to draw from, so I would suggest that it takes a
more substantial layer of material to accomodate such a network (of
superconducting heat absorption fibers), and a \'real\' quantity of volume
for any effective heat sink (a 1/4 liter or so at TL14) and its associated
stuff.

At least up until TL15.

Not a bad idea, but I think the detector that would pick up such currents
is obscure.  Perhaps more aof a point-heat source dissipater, but then
you\'d make the whole person a heat source.

no less!).

However, in "Guns From  Navarone",  "Return  Of  The  Jedi",  and
"Battlestar Galactica" these are special cases.  But  _if_  meson
gun emplacements are commonly used  for  planetary  defense  then
this sort of covert mission would also  be  common.  In  the  5FW
game you could perhaps say that such installations  are  included
in a world\'s SDB rating ... but in that case wouldn\'t  the  Zho\'s
have an advantage: once a small teleporting Zho commando team  is
on the planet\'s surface they would find it easier to  locate  and
penetrate a PD installation  than  their  Imperial  counterparts.
Also, in the long-term prepartions for war (either  as  aggressor
or  defender)  both  sides  would  be   heavily   involved   with
intelligence missions to locate these installations and penetrate
them with sleeper  agents  ...  you  can  imagine  the  level  of
paranoia that the defenders of a  PD  installation  would  suffer
even in peace time.

Just thinking out loud, but should the Zho\'s have a  minor  bonus
to their anti-SDB rolls? ... and shouldn\'t  there  be  some  step
during 5FW set-up to determin (secretly) which \'SDB\'s  have  been
compromised by pre-war intelligence missions? ... and even  while
\'covert\' wouldn\'t the Ine Givar still be able  to  contribute  to
this phase of warfare?

I suppose ideally you want to integrate the  En Guard  rules  for
Social Level change into Traveller.  (Being seen with the \'right\'
people, contributing to worthy causes, patronising the  Arts  ...
in _addition_ to conspicous spending.)  Also, there should  be  a
difference between Social Level and Noble Title, even if the  two
factors are related (spending like a Duke  will  not  get  you  a
Duchy).

:-) Yeah. Practicalities always seem to win out, yes? I\'ve only known one
DM who has used the dynamic balance concept...

>I also get bored/tired of continual \'tech versus tech\' battles that Jo
>mentioned.
Ah, but, the other side of the coin is that once you separate but too many
tech levels, you can get bitten the other way. I usually assume a 2-3 tech
level blind spot. For example:

Say Sgt. Superdude has his top-of-the-line TL15 stealth suit and feels it
should be a doddle to break into a TL4 compound. He para-sails in, switches
on super-invisible mode, and strolls about.
Then he steps on a caltrop. The super respiration adsorption filter stifles
his scream as the rusty point penetrates his plastic, non shedding sole,
and he limps bravely on. It isn\'t long, though, before Woofer, their
security dog, catches the sound of the gravel rubbing on the gravel as he
moves through the courtyard. He  barks and gives chase (as he does several
times a night, anyway) once he catches the whiff of blood on the discarded
caltrop.
Sgt. Superdude, irrationally fearing the dog, having forgotten his suit\'s
built in DNA filters, runs toward a disused corner hoping to hide behind
some brush (having forgotten his suits chameleon option). Unfortunately he
steps on the cover to a pit trap and plummets 3 meters down onto spikes.
To his relief his anti-puncture layer works against blunt wooden spikes,
whereas it failed against the sharper caltrop although the bruises are
going to smart. Bells attached to the cover attract the world\'s attention,
though, and the pit is quickly surrounded by SMG wielding guards and dogs
who are going mad (for no particular reason, they\'re just excited).
Fortunately, again, the super shade option of his suit blends him in to the
flashlight pierced gloom of the pit as he lies still and waits for them to
go away.
Eventually the guards go, as they assume the dogs are just excited. Sgt.
Superdude eventually levers himself to his feet and finds a convenient tree
root to pull himself up to the surface. Unfortunately the tree root is
false and merely opens up a septic tank drain which drenches him and fills
the pit, ringing more bells. The guards return, with even more excited
dogs, see that _something_ is sloshing around the sewage and empty a few
clips from their SMGs for good measure.
Lying bruised, battered, half-submerged in sewage with a few flesh wounds
from the low penetration bullets, Sgt. Superdude contemplates his fate as
the guards finish their cigarettes, toss the buts down the pit. He signals
for extraction.

Now exceptionally clever (anal) players might keep a variety of stealth
suits for each tech level so they are always one, and just one, step ahead.
I\'m a firm believer in Achilles heels, in both directions. A group of
low-ish tech PCs took out a TL15 scout ship with a cannon mounted on their
spacecraft. (No IR trace, too low mass for densiometer readings, too slow
for doppler shifts. Bang!)

>grav-maserati zipping around the city?
Erk, the traffic hazards. Personally I\'d like Grav-Busses to be able to see
me!

None, I guess. Just an implementation detail.

No, you are right. Audio is not EM. It is quite different from Visual. To
do audio what you need is for the top layer of your suit to be able to
vibrate. (Someone has recently patented a solid-state speaker that works
like this.) That\'s why I said _low intensity_ sound. Otherwise you would
have to walk around with the equivalent of a Ghetto Blaster covering your
skin :-).

    'body' => 'I finally remembered my third question! (regarding T4 Combat)

In the case of Spectacular success, the book states that the minimum
possible roll to achieve success, equals a spectacular success.

This almost always comes out to rolling all ones on a task.  So that
would be a single 1 one a 1D test, two 1\'s on a 2D test, etc...

In the case of a Spectacular failure, the book states two 6\'s on ANY roll
indicate spectacular failure.

I have two questions:

1.  For a Spec Success, how are the rolls handled for the half dice?  My
assumption is that in the case of a Difficult task (2.5D), Spec Success is
achieved on a roll of 3 (two dice rolling 1\'s and the half die rolling a 1 or
2)

2.  Does the number of sixes rolled increase for a Spec Failure, as the
difficulty increases too?  For example, on an Difficult test (2.5D), Spec
Failure is achieved ona roll of 9( two dice rolling 6\'s and the half die
rolling a 6).

Or does the rule of 6 apply only with full and not half dice?  For
example, Spec Failure is achieved for an Average AND Difficult test
when two 2 dice roll 6\'s; for a Formidible and Staggering test when 3
dice roll 6\'s; etc.

Or is it ALWAYS when 2 dice roll 6\'s, regardless of difficulty?

If it is ALWAYS when 2 dice roll 6\'s, could someone explain the
rationale for me?  It doesn\'t seem logical.

Thanks for your help!

have the Technician character added to it courtesy of Paolo Marino\'s fine

Stay tuned to the TML for that announcement.

NEW TO BEGINNINGS v0.96beta:

v0.96:  Released February 23, 1998.

        1) I think I\'ve finally tracked down the rank bug in Navy careers
        (begins dodging fruit and catcalls <g>). The program was finally
        keeping track of the correct ranks, it just wasn\'t telling the printer
        or the save file what the correct rank *was*.
        
        2) Fixed the Diplomat bug where it would give you a normal chance of
        enlisting on the first attempt and then an astronomical chance on the
        subsequent attempts due to an undefined variable value. This also (I
        think) fixes the ability to re-enlist as a Diplomat an infinite number
        of times.
    
        3)Fixed bug in Navy career that allowed Social Standing to go above 15
        with promotions.

        4) Skills are now complete up to Camoflage; a few interface and color
        changes made; more will be input as I have time to work on it.

That\'s it for this time, as before I want to release a program that does the
actual process of chargen *correctly* before I pretty it up. Let me know 
what you find, what corrections need to be made, any bugs still crawling
about, and what you\'d like to see, and hopefully in a week or two the 
mythical "Version 1.0" will be ready for the light of day.

It makes perfect sense for a import/export company on a TL9 world to have TL14
anti-burglary sensors.  It doesn\'t even require any handwaving if there\'s a
TL14 planet within a jump or two away.

Free traders and commercial trading companies don\'t exist to trade only
novelties, natural resources and animal specimens across the Imperium.  They
exist to trade all kinds of goods, TL14 security systems included.

I agree with the second part.  I\'ve always held that a high Social Standing
didn\'t automatically mean a noble title.  The Regional director of GSbAG
might be SOC 13, and still be a coomoner, but a very rich and powerful
commoner.  As for the being seen and doing good works, that\'s part of the
expenditure of credits.  I tend to see SOC as a indication of how people
view you, so a upper-class person who ends up on skid row isn\'t going to
automatically have the advantages of his birth.  The only exception uis for
actual nobles.  I keep track of their true SOC along with their apparent
level.  This allows some fun when the scruffy ship\'s engineer steps forward
and reveals himself as the heir to the Duchy of Glisten.

If hamsters have  guns,  and  some  at  least  are  organised  as
hamster-troopers, then it follows that you need hamster APCs  (or
AHCs).  My God, I\'ve got it: that\'s  what  those  shoe-box  sized

Actually, the trouble with KKMs is that at the required speeds, they
don\'t steer worth a damn. So terminal guidance is pretty much a bad

Depends. They may be useful for detecting ships at "close" ranges. At
least enough to give other sensors an idea of where to look.

Actually, most "hypertech" type stuff tends to be self correcting. The
players learn fairly quickly that if *they* can get it, not only can
their enemies get it, but the more "well funded" of them can get
*better*. <evil grin>

Trouble is that when that becomes practical, the *home* level detectors
will upgrade to "imaging" detectors. That is, they\'ll be able to note
that they are no longer getting a return from part of the wall that the
intruder is standing in front of. Some *current* systems are almost at
this level (I\'m talking "high-end" home security, not "industrial"!)

Also, I have *great* difficulty believing in a 2kg "can" that can
absorb the required number of kilocalories of heat. That implies an
*unreal* heat capacity.

Odor/chemical sensors will be down to "home use" well before TL15.
Probably before TL12. But an activated characoal liner (disposable)

I was giving that as a "natural" ability for a suit that *didin\'t*

Again, that was assuming the suit that can chemical and IR mask.

>>1. oxygen consumption (difficult, even at high tech levels)

I just realized an *easy* way to do this. Not suitable for "home" use,
but quite possible for industrial and government security. 

Fill the area with dry nitrogen gas. This has the added bonus of
prolonging the life of things like paper records. Use a slight
overpressure (ie the "air" pressure inside is a bit higher than
outside, so "air" tends to flow *out*). 

First attempt:
1. Character in suit opens door/window/access panel.
2. Character goes thru opening in the face of a very slight breeze.
3. Character closes /door/window/etc behind self.
4. Character starts into area.
5. Character passes out from lack of oxygen.
6. Character dies if loud *thump* from falling doesn\'t set off alarm.
   Else character is grabbed by security team.

Second attempt, using oxygen bottle and mask:
1. Character in suit opens door/window/access panel.
2. Character goes thru opening in the face of a very slight breeze.
3. Character closes /door/window/etc behind self.
4. Character starts into area.
5. Since O2 must be at slight overpresuure to prevent excess nitrogen
   from seeping into mask, some oxygen is lost to environment. More is
   lost with each exhalation, along with C02 and water vapor. Sensors
   detect anomalous gases and trigger alarm.

Third attempt, using rebreather and "sealed" suit. Might just work, but
it\'s a royal pain. :-)

>>2. CO2 emmissions (easier)

See above for a way to make detecting them *much* easier. :-)

Actually, unless you go with the activated charcoal liner trick, it
won\'t work against a TL9(?) "mechanical sniffer" that merely catalogs
"trace molecules". And a few TLs later, that won\'t work.

The "drones" are basicly remote controlled cameras and microphones. So
you *have* human eyes and ears.

Sounds like there will be plenty. And as I said beforeif they can get
it, so can the other side. Maybe even *better*.

How about 2d6 rolled in the "11 to 66" manner? That gives 36 evenly
distributed results, which means that you can "assign" 4 results to
each of the digits 1-9, with equal probability. Here\'s a table, using
the crudest method of assigning the values:

    1 2 3 4 5 6
  +----
1 | 1 1 1 1 2 2
2 | 2 2 3 3 3 3
3 | 4 4 4 4 5 5
4 | 5 5 6 6 6 6
5 | 7 7 7 7 8 8
6 | 8 8 9 9 9 9

And here\'s version that eliminates the dependence on which die is
rolled first. 

    1 2 3 4 5 6
  +----
1 | 1 1 2 3 4 4
2 | 1 1 2 3 5 6
3 | 2 2 6 5 7 7
4 | 3 3 5 6 8 8
5 | 4 5 7 8 9 9
6 | 4 6 7 8 9 9

There you are 1-9 multiplier, even distribution.

Trouble is, that\'s like trying to send in "special ops" teams to take
out Cheyenne mountain, or to take out our ballistic missile subs or
the ICBM control bunkers. *First* you have to find them, *then* you
have to get to them. 

In the case of Cheyenne mountain, the location is known. In the case of
the contol bunkers, the location is unknown, but fixed. And the subs
are at unknown *mobile* locations. 

Cheyenne mountain and the bunkers are specifically designed to
withstand *multiple* direct hits by nuclear warheads. The subs are
harder to find, but easier to destroy once found.

And security makes sneaking in to *any* of these effectively
impossible. You *might* manage to get a *very* deep cover "mole"
selected as part of the crewing.

Deep meson sites will have similar protection and security. And there
may even be sites analogous to submarines, "swimming" through the molten
rock inside the planet.

Once you separate Title from SOC then you have to decide what SOC
actually  represents.  I  use  it  to  represent  the  degree  of
influence a character weilds apart  from  his  rank,  title,  and
wealth.  To impress those of lower SOC than  you,  you  associate
(or be seen to associate) with those people whom  the  lower  SOC
types look up to (usually higher SOC than you).  Then  the  lower
SOC people think you must be even higher SOC than you are ... and
their thinking this makes it so.  (I\'m not sure I said that  very
well!)  Doing good deeds also impresses people.  It is true  that
all this can cost money, but you  can  spend  lots  on  money  on
\'lifestyle\' without raising SOC.  Also, when  there  is  a  large
difference in SOC there can _sometimes_ be a reverse effect as  a
result of resentment of the lower classes to the upper.

So if Title and SOC are different then SOC must work a bit like a
Vargr\'s Charisma.

Depends. They may be useful for detecting ships at "close" ranges. At

One of my (US) Navy friends has used the phrase "as useful as a metal detector on board a submarine." - I think that would apply to a densitometer or grav detector that was inside a starship. If you have a contra-grav field running, can you detect any gravity sources? Isn\'t your field countering all outside grav influences?

Hmmm...or are you not detecting grav influences from a dedicated gravitometer? Are you just analyzing stresses on the contra-grav generators? And just how much gravitic disturbance does a ship with a 1G internal artificial gravity field make, anyway?

That\'s correct - the major advantage of the soliton model of grav focussing
is that it requires very weak field strengths, because it\'s only "bending"
the beam very slightly. Back-of-the-envelope I got field strengths ~1G,
which is certainly within reach of imperial tech.

How do you intent to protect the mobile site from the pressure and temperature at those depths? I don\'t think even TL 12 engineering can withstand conditions inside a planet\'s mantle. Of course, if you could pull it off then power wouldn\'t be a problem...

While I can see some devices mounted in large submersibles, I think the average heavy planetary meson site will be deep underground, but still in solid rock. Here\'s an idea - a high population world that\'s mostly urbanized. It would probably have underground transit tubes, some designed to carry heavy freight modules. Build a couple of hundred (or thousand) meson gun modules, have them cycling around the transportation system so the baddies won\'t know where they are.

I wasn\'t questioning the availability, only the perceived necessity vs.
cost and therefore the actual presence of such devices.

Culturally, Different planets and cities differ in their need for security.
Even Boston vs. a relatively wealthy suburb - like Burlington (MA) - have
vastly different security needs.  My point above is that there will be
plenty of homes and businesses that will not got to the time and expense
(and in some cases hazard and inconvenience - like filling your shop with
nitrogen every night) of buying security equivalent to a bank or military
installation.

That said, it makes perfect sense for an import/export company on a TL 9
world to import TL 14 security equipment...if there is a criminal culture
on their world which regularly breaks in, defeating TL9 to TL13 security
systems routinely.

My Vision of The Future(tm) does not include super-security systems in
every home and business.  Therefore I am not going to offer my players the
technology to enter these places in a guaranteed undetectable manner, only
in a mildly undetectable manner.

Actually that last bit should read "...not being able to think through all
the implications of a particular device with the same diligence as _n_
players, where _n_ is a variable composed of the player, the other players
in the group, their friends, and their smart-ass thirteen-year-old

Defines the problems facing the average GM much more accurately!

Fine, that\'ll be a nasty suprise.  As I state in another thread, however,
this level of technology, while available, will not necessarily be present
in every home/office due to price/cultural considerations.

Perhaps there will be home odor detectors by TL12, perhaps not.  Perhaps
they will be present in a given situation, perhaps not.  In either case I
did not prepare the design to counter this particular technology.

Permeability to the moisture of sweat and breath in one direction seems to
me to imply permeability in the other direction too.  Since the equipment
is optimized nad designed to prevent particulate and chemical matter from
getting out, all the filters are "pointed" the wrong way.  Perhaps another
item could be designed with this feature, but I do not think this item
would be.  Its just a matter of designed purpose and the complication of
protecting against CBN materials.

Use whatever handwave you wish, I\'m sure there are many ways to approach
the problem at TL8, never mind TL14.  Also, detecting molecules of odor is
not the same as being able to identify someone, which was my point.

Come now, you know what I mean.  As you say below.

Cameras and drones can\'t (usually) open drawers and cabinets, remove or
insert storage crystals, hotwire locked door entry systems, or be player
characters (all these things should say "usually").

Not a bad idea, with a couple of changes:

1) Explicitly note that this will not get you a title!  True, titles have
been purchased, but this should be a matter of role-playing.

2) Explicitly note that low spending doesn\'t lose your title. You may not
get the respect it should command, but you still hold the title.

3) Adjust the spending requirements for characters in active service, or
on a starship, to reflect the subsidy that meals/quarters etc provides.
(Although I suppose that a really high-status character might be expected
to maintain a permanent residence somewhere.)

4) Limit the speed of SS gain from conspicuous consumption, and put a
limit on total shift. This would be culture-dependent. Eg. in Victorian
England it would take several generations for the \'wealth\' to become
respectable; it was faster in America. 

Note that this speed limit would be reduced for characters recovering
their fortunes (they already have the connections/manners/whatnot).

Nope. I\'m not trying to integrate any rules changes to anything. I\'m
only commenting on what others have written, and trying to imagine their
considered reasoning. On his points, I can both see where he is coming
from and I agree that that is probably what would happen or have to
happen before any change would come about. Do you feel that the change,
as he has decribed it, would come about faster in another way? If so, in
what way?

I like to treat SOC more like a charisma characteristic, tempered by
using the TNE NPC Motivation Tables and JG\'s Traveller Logbook Personal
and Family Background generation. This also creates some very
interesting character creations. But, I like your approach to keeping
both true and apparent levels. Makes sense, especially for the scenario
I presented before.

A very interesting and well done development. I do think you may have

I would think that such an inventive and resourceful culture would have
developed some method of domesticating forms of undersea animals and
agricultural development, even if it was only in the organization of say
an artistically beautiful coral reef display inviting tourism from other
islands (much like the area on the northern coast of Australia). This
might also have led to the piracy and warfare that developed, despite
what seems should be a fun loving, creative and carefree society. I
can\'t imagine what they had to fight about.

I like the idea of large subs with meson spinal mounts crawling around
under a few kilometers of water, receiving their targeting data with a
meson communicator (doesn\'t work for low tech or low water worlds,
though).  The sub can easily reorient itself in three dimensions, and
exploit gravitic propulsion.

All the technology would be tried and true by TL 15.  Lower TLs could
solve the communication problem by some other means, perhaps a commo
network on the ocean bottom.  Why go crazy spending TCr to put stuff in
the mantle of the planet?

How would they aim the meson guns?  The tubes would have to be really
short for it to work.

a clear demand for these books.

I\'ve heard that someone is planning to put a lot of the CT stuff on CD-Rom.  While
any access to the material would be desirable from my CT-barren library, hardcopy is
preferable.

My hope:  that Marc or someone with the legal authority to do so, would make this
holy, ancient, and canonical works available in hardcopy form.  For me, I don\'t need
them to be reprinted on quality paper with the slick covers, etc.  Just need / want /
crave the information.  I\'ll take photocopies.  Of course, I\'d pay more for better
quality, but given the capabilities of the ubiquitous photocopy place, they could
probably even staple bind such works very cheaply.

Think about it, if an original copy of High Guard can get a $15 bid, how much could
be made on 20 cheaply made copies?  $3?  Thats $60.  Take it a step farther and make
it worth the effort.  Bundle \'em.  That way, you get a cheaper price on the copies
from the photoplace and makes shipping costs better to.  So make it Books 0-5 in for
$20 + $4 shipping.  I\'d do it in a heartbeat.   Question is, would enough others be
interested to make it worth Marc or whoevers time?

Of course, there is another alternative:  Deluxe Collector\'s CT Compendium   - The
Original Books 0-5 and maybe some supplements reformatted into one nice hardcover
book (kind of on the order of the current Mileu 0 hardcover) with a sleek black
slipcase with the red line and "Traveller" on it?  Yummy.

I like this one too (especially the one without order to the dice), but
the 1D3 algorithm takes less printed space.  We could also express it as a
formula: 

Population Multiplier = 1D3 + [ 3 x (1D3 - 1) ]

Where "1D3" is simply a shorthand for "floor(1D6/2)".  I think that\'s
basically the same as your first table, but I really like that second one.


Thanks,

My party took a far trader and, more or less, replaced its cargo bay with a
50t meson bay and a power supply for it. I wouldn\'t let them fire it while
in flight (that would be just a _little_ violation of the hardpoint rule!),
but I did allow them to "emplace" it on a planetary surface, or, more
often, underwater.
Basically emplacing meant securing its position and nailing it to the crust
or whatever is needed to make it a fixed instalation rather than a ship.

I applied to Marc Miller for a lisence to electronically publish CT books

the CT base books electronically, then, maybe, in paper. Each would have to

There are rules for grav sensors (based on the assumption that they can
pick up gravitic "wakes" from thruster plates) and neutrino sensors 
in the FFS2 errata (on various web pages near you.) They\'re fairly
short ranged and not directional enough for fire control. It\'s assumed that
they\'re at least partially shielded from the ship\'s own gravity...

Our group liked to defeat security systems the old-fashioned way. The best sensor is, eventually, controlled by a Mk I human with a Mk I brain. Whether we\'re talking the security guard at the monitors, the tech whiz who built the system, or the Imperial Governor with authority over the installation, at some level there is a person involved.

And if you\'re good enough, and can identify him, this person can be overcome. Bribed, conned, cajoled, replaced, whatever. The highest tech security system in the world is useless if the owner hands you the keys.

How would they aim the meson guns?  The tubes would have to be really
short for it to work.

Have sidings designed for the purpose, several dozen (or more) per weapon. The siding would have a communications repeater linked to planetary sensor arrays, and would be wide enough and tall enough for the articulated meson mount on the transport module to swing freely. The meson tube could be as long as the largest freight module, and could even (with telescoping segments) be longer - it would just take extra time to deploy after moving to a new site.

P.S. Game balance is a simple matter of making sure the bad guys have
weapons and equipment equal to the players, if not a little better
(afterall, there\'s more of them than there is of you around the table).
Your players want suits that allow them to travel undetected?  Fine,
introduce them to their next opponent: Predator.  They want to be Superman?
Introduce them to their new opponent: Lex Luther (and his brand new
Kryponite laser).  In all cases however make sure that you don\'t break the
system.  Traveller in all its forms is a very flexible game, but there are
always limits (the stats for a 100 megaton hydrogen bomb should not be a
regular concern of the PCs, even if it\'s neat to know information).

Mr. Potato Head is _obviously_ Zhodani in inspiration -- intended to be
anti-Imperial propaganda for their own kids, but it caught on among the
clueless Impies.

Rubik\'s Cube is just as obviously a Droyne "scrying" focus, like the

Good Vibrations is clearly a front business for techno/new-age Darrian

Barney is clearly a Hiver manipulation attempt to "sell" the Ithlkur to the

Pretty neat idea, but what if the enemy targets all the transit lines with
their meson guns?  Disable the transit lines, and the PDMGs can\'t move.  I
think this idea works better with CT/MT than with TNE/T4, because in the
old tech arch you can build a reasonable MG that fits in a boxcar.  In the
new tech arch, you need the thing to be 100 meters long to hurt anything
beyond low orbit.  Fortunately, I like the old "tech arch".

For high tech, high population worlds without a lot of water for hiding
submarines, I think this idea has some merit, but they will probably also
want some spinal mount sized weapons to hit the big stuff with.

Ouch.  Throw away that hardpoint rule, and CT rules can produce some
really *nasty* ships!  Imagine a 400 ton ship with a 50 ton bay!  Ouch!

The best part about this is: Since a sub doesn\'t use a jump drive, it doesn\'t
need refined fuel.  Thus you could just pump the sea water right into your fusion
plant.  And since the water is ever present, you wouldn\'t need fuel storage space
aboard the sub either.

Cool!  You\'d have to pump the water into a fuel purification plant, but
that\'s not a big deal.

Perhaps I will fudge-design just a beast.  A factor-T meson gun sounds
nice, throw in some bays for good measure.  :)

You don\'t even need the purification plant.  As best as I can tell, the only
thing refined fuel is needed for is Jump fuel.  That seems to be the only place
where using unrefined fuel causes a problem.  Its still probably adviable to use
the purification plant, but by the book, I don\'t think its necessary.

  I just wanted to add refitting existing ICBM launchers in existing subs.  I
imagine those tubes are pretty long and dropping a whole bank of Mesons on an
invading ship would be pretty ugly.  Rather than upgrading the Sub\'s power plant,
they could use Explosive Power Generators.  Insert cartridge, detonate, fire, eject
spent cartridge.  It might be cheaper, especially if you can design your meson gun
to the same dimensions of a Polaris missile.  You\'ll still need external sensors and
a meson communicator for targeting.

Btw, what range is appropriate for planetary defense?

I ran the math thru my number cruncher...this means a starport E on a world
of Pop 1 billion generates enough cargo per week to fill 446 of the LARGE
armed freighters in the Starships guide, or over 3500 Subsidized
Freighters(same book) my math as follows
cargo capacity Large Armed Frieghter:1600 std I figure an std of cargo is
about 14 tonnes of mass( I believe that the official answer is about 11 on
average, but I calculated it high)
1billion X 10 kilos = 10billion kilos = 10 million tonnes=714286 (rounded)
std at 14 tonnes per STD
714286/1600=446
Calculating the mass of 1 std as 11 changes the number of ships to around
568.
I am not expressing an opinion with these numbers, just informing you of
them. For a planet of 1 million people, the transport would be handled by 4
subsidized freighters (at 1std=14 metric tons)

Call me slow, but I realized today that the concept of unlimited cargo
makes little sense to me. In CT, the amount of cargo available was
determined by rolling dice. Different dice were rolled depending upon
the nature of the cargo. One roll per week was allowed on the cargo
determination chart. In MT, the procedure was similar.

In both systems, there was a definite limit to how much cargo a crew
would "find" in a week. This forced them to make decisions about what to
buy. The decisions were based on cargo capacity, expected profit, and
other factors.

Perhaps I\'m misinterpreting Marc\'s comments. To me, cargo isn\'t the
primary product of a world, it\'s whatever the group manages to make a
deal on. The cargo may not even have been manufactured on the local
world; the group may have bought it off of an incoming spaceship.

If, as Marc says, cargo is the primary product of a world, and if it\'s
available in unlimited quantities, then the whole concept of speculative
trade in Traveller has changed. For one thing, if a product is available
in unlimited quantities, the laws of supply and demand say that I will
be buying that product at _extremely_ low prices, much lower than what
the charts indicate.

It also means that there\'s no point hunting for a good deal or for
interesting things to buy: there\'s only one thing to buy and it\'s really
cheap.

Am I confused?

I wondered about that! I haven\'t seen a post from IG on TML, did I miss
their post somehow? Was it a press release? It wasn\'t on their website, I
checked. Could someone post a copy of whatever IG released?

Yes, I\'m sure we *all* hope that\'s the case.

Ah, Phil! Whatever do you mean? ;-p

Frankly, I\'m not surprised about the "breath catching." IG has pretty much
completed the collection of M0 books, and until Marc has T4.1 ready it
doesn\'t make much sense to push a lot of new material out the door. The
existing books seem to be selling pretty well, regardless of what some
people think of them, so conserving resources until they are ready to start
back up with the new T4.1 line and/or they see how the GURPS line does
makes good business sense.

As many of you know, I\'ve argued against the use of the d3 in T4 and Marc\'s

Yes, undoubtedly different places will have different security needs.
However, real need and perceived need are two entirely different things.  And
with the proliferation of technology in the Traveller universe, and the low
cost of high technology on high tech worlds skews the cost factor severely.

Sure, these places won\'t have the heavy bank sensors of modern day labs and
banks, but, even the simplest systems on a high tech world will be very
powerful, smaller, less expensive, and require less maintenance.

Whoops, sent my message before I actually finished it.  This logic only works
if the business on a TL9 world goes about it linearly.  "Okay, our TL9 system

Every single Mom and Pop operation in the Imperium isn\'t going to have a TL14

through the trouble of using a TL13/14 stealth suit or what not might possibly
have one.

The conversion rules in 3G3 for T4 use something like this:

Rnds/Turn   Damage   RoF DM   Weapon Type
   <30       1.5x      -1
  30-60       2x       -0
  61-120     2.5x      +1
 121-300      3x       +2     RF
   >300       4x       +4     VRF

Damage is modified *after* armour penetration.

Notice the negative DM for firing a weapon with a calculated ROF of less
than 5 rounds per second.  It actually makes sense, and the attack still
does cause more damage than normal.  Also note that the "Rnds/Turn" figure
does not allow you to reload and continue firing in the same combat turn.
If a weapon has an ROF of 10 rounds per second, but only has a 28 round
clip, it uses the "<30" row.

Hopefully Marc is reading this and will include such a rule in T4.1.

Oops!  I just thought of something (after re-reading my previous post).
This would only apply to self-seeking missiles.  Missiles steered via the
mothership would communicate via a laser and a sensor mounted in the tail
of said missile (thereby putting the sensor out of range of enemy fire).
Of course, with the delay in communication over the beam, the target may
not be where you think it is by the time the missile receives the "turn
left 0.2 degrees" command...

Yes, but if all you need to do is damage the delicate components of a
sensor system, you could get away firing far more laser pulses of less
power.  Instead of ROFs of 800, try 80,000!  Now how do you hide a sensor
from *that*? :)

Rules for HEAP weapons like AV mines and missiles can be "extracted" from
the damage codes in Emperor\'s Arsenal.  A "LAAW-8" has a damage code of "23
(16 expl.)".  A total of 23 dice are used to attempt to breach the armour
(the "AP" part), while only 16 are used to determine blast effects to those
standing nearby (the "HE" part).

BTW, the "Fragment" listing for such weapons as the "Grenade-8" is covered
under Explosives on p. 59 of the T4 rulebook.  "Directed Fragmentation" and
additional "Explosives" rules are also included on p. 9 of Emperor\'s
Arsenal.

No sir, I don\'t like it. I\'m roughly middle class and spend less than twice
the amount on monthly support than a relative who, I will charitably say,
is near the bottom of the social scale. At the same time, my monthly
support is only an infinitesimal fraction of that of celebrities like Elton
John or Ivana Trump, who apparently are not able to live in the manner they
are accustomed to when only taking in mere tens of millions of dollars per
year.

Yet the proposed monthly support cost would make me spend roughly quadruple
that of a low-status person, and less than half that of a planetary ruler.
Moreover, such a distribution would suggest there are roughly equal numbers
of people at each social rank.

I don\'t think so.

If cost of living is to be related to social standing, it should use some
kind of exponential scale, where low scores only increase costs slightly,
while high scores require vastly greater expenditures.

I envisioned them refining their hunting and gathering techniques into
a form of ranching. So although the animals were not "domesticated" they
were exploited a lot more efficently than might be expected. But I wanted
to convey a dichotomy of culture that was both extremly primitive and
extremely sophisticated at the same time. However I do like your idea of
art via domesticated animals; that would appeal to the Luriani.

As to warfare, well have you ever seen artists together :*>. The Luriani
are a *very* emotional people; they take jealousy, greed, anger and
passion to whole new levels. A critical debate as to the merits of the
Impressionists as against the pre-Raphaelites amongst the Luriani could
easily lead to bloodshead and full scale mobilisations.

IIRC that was part of DGPs plans for the Rebellions\' endgame. However, I

There\'s nothing in CT (Bk5, 2nd Ed) to stop you doing that apart from the
power demands. 1 bay per 1000 dT is the rule. MT\'s COACC had orbital
satellites with bays in the sub-1000dt range. So it appears to be
interpreted as *1 bay per 1000dT or part there of*.

Customs *will* have the best tech they can afford for the cases where
nothing else will do. But that stealth bag is likely to be defeated by
something as simple as a "pat down" search, or a trained "sniffer"
animal.

As for an invisible grav-maserati, you will have problems because the
*other* traffic doesn\'t see. you. And because you can\'t see out very
well.

The chameleon coating changes the *surface color* of the suit to match
the "background", and, like a chameleon, this loses out where you are
up against a wall and someone looks *along* the wall. You are only
"invisible" in certain directions.

The fiber idea is to "carry" the *lihght* that hits one spot to a spot
on the opposite side of the suit, and release it going in the original
direction. In effect, "bending" the light around you. So for *any*
direction you are "invisible"

But because it is doing this with surface coloring, you have the
inherent problem that a given spot on the surface can only be *one*
color, but the color of the relevant bit of background depends on which
direction you are looking at the suit from.

If this isn\'t clear place a object (say a glass) on a table. place the
point of a pencil against the surface. Look at whatever is *behind* the
glass and figure out what color that part of the glass would have to be
to "blend in". Now, without taking the point of the pencil off that
spot, move around the glass until the background is a different color. 

See, for one direction the spot has to be (say) the color of the wall),
for the other, it has to be the color of the couch. But it can only be
*one* color. So for some directions the suit will make you *more*
noticable. Oops!

Acoustic energy is *not* EM! Sound is waves of differences in *air
pressure*. So you are correct in thinking that two vaery different
methods pof handling things are needed.

You detect air current via the ultrasonic "radar", differences in aire
density cause frequency and phase shifts in the returned signal.
Differences in air *velocity* cause doppler shifting. This is stuff
that we can do *now*. It\'s just that brezes through the window, drafts,
and the heating system all make it something that actually has to be
filtered *out*. 

Given a more controlled environment, or more computer power in the
sensor, it could be a real problem. (ie, it\'d be able to figure out the
"shape", "size" and temp" of any air disturbance, and sound an alarm in
it was essentially humanlike.

Compare the *size* of the molecules involved, water, O2 and CO2 are all
*small* molecules. The various trace chemicals useful for detecting
intruders are *much* large (like a beachball versus a golf ball). Ditto
for the various chemical warfare agents. And viruses are *incrediblly
large (if a water molecule is a cm across a small virus is quite a few
*meters* across). Ditto for the dust particles that constitute "fallout".
Radiation will still get thru.

On the down side, membranes with regular pores that small are hard to
make. And currently, they tend to be fragile. And have limited
thoughput.

Nope. Mass detectors detect exactly that. They are inherently 3d. Just
like using a compass on a steel ship, you "calbrate" the sensor after
installation so as to compensate for the "fixed" mass of the ship. 

Cargo and supplies will be added to the database as they are loaded.
And this is where many a smuggler/stoaway gets caught. The manifest
entry says the module is one thing, but the detector says that the mass
or density (mass distribution) is wrong. At which point the module gets
checked out *very* carefully. 

Crew moving around requires active compensation but is still doable.

Even ignoring the fact that the effects of contragrav have to be
*different* from those of gravity, given the way it is described as
working, the detector *will* need a tie in with the inertial
compensators/internal gravity. But again, that\'s going to be a known
signal, and thus something you can ignore.

Remember, mass detectors *exist*. And they work on the earths surface,
which is a lot stronger signal source than anything on board ship will
be! 

Essentially they measure *changes* in the field strength, and to locate
things they rotate, so that *they* generate* a change in the field even
if the "target" isn\'t moving.

So a ship will have multiple, widely seperated units, as well as one
near the ship\'s "center". 

These detect "mass" or "density boundaries". They are *not* gravity
wave detectors. Those are a quite different item and work quite
differently.

No, if the network is extensive enough, you just move a gun to a
section of the network where it\'ll be pointing in the right direction.
This does somewhat constrain your firing solutions, but with even
current computers, it\'s not going to be *that* big a handicap.

Temp is a problem, but enough refrigeration gear will let you keep
cool, at the cost of creating a *very* hot spot next to you. Luckiliy,
by the time enough heat leaks through the crust, you\'ll be somewhere
else. IR detectors *won\'t* work.

Pressure is a problem, but I suspect that with things like superdense,
you can make something stronger than mere rock. But i agree that you
aren\'t going to be going *too* deep.

You\'ve just re-invented the "ICBM disguised as a freight car". :-)

Note that the more urbanized the planet the harder it\'ll be to knock
out the sensors for the meson sites. There will be a planet wide web of
"fiber optic" (or similar) data links. And it\'s quite possible that the
sensors for the deep meson sites will be cheap simple sensor packages
that are part of every buildings data link. So the deep sites tap into
the data stream and have the equivalent of a million to *billion*
element interferometer covering the planet. Chopping enough holes in
the web to seriously degrade the capability of such a setup would look
a lot like "indisciminate carpet bommbing of civilian areas" :-)

So unless you are trying to *destroy* the culture, rather than conquer
it, you have to just accept the fact that you can\'t knock out their
"spotters". And you may not be able to knock out the deep meson sites.

Actually, I\'m coming at this from  another  direction:  it  _can_
work as originally posted, but not always.

Consider the group of dirt poor belters  who  strike  the  mother
lode.  They decide to retire and enjoy the good life ... they buy
a mansion ... have installed a 10 meter  high  statue  of  Albert
Eienstein urinating expensive mineral water into a pond  (on  the
front lawn) ...  always  feed  dinner  guests  burger  and  fries
(served by white gloved staff) ... keep the  ketchup  in  crystal
decanters ("cos its class, init?") ... join the local  golf  club
and always take a large keg of beer with them while they  try  to
play (and yelling and laughing at the other patrons).  Somehow  I
feel that even after a year of high spending they may  still  not
get their quota of invites to the local Duke\'s social evenings.

Something else needs to happen in _addition_ to  spending  before
social class will rise.  Its that \'something else\'  that  I  feel
has been missing from the rules.  Hense my original comment about
En Guard.

I gather from your remark that someone has invented something similar, or
even identical to, the glass rod pictures I made up. I didn\'t know that,
but now that I do, all I can say is "So what? What does a mostly unknown
toy on one planet have to do with a major sector-spanning artform else-
where, even if they use the same medium?" However, if you give me the
names of a few famous Lite Brite artists and tell me what museums they
are displayed at, I\'ll amend the Library Data entry to mention that the
art form was also known on pre-starflight Terra.

You already did that when you dispersed meson site sensors all over the planet.

Another way to think of it, though - now no one can attack your planet without turning it into a radioactive slag heap. You are thereby protected from anyone who wants to capture your planet - what\'s the point of shattering your starfleet and bleeding your drop troops to capture a wasteland? If the enemy doesn\'t have to take you, this kind of defense could make them leave you alone.

People who want to deny your planet to someone else, or destroy your base of operations are still a problem. If you\'re an important planet in a frontier sector of an empire, or your system is home to a naval or other force-projection base, then you\'re a good candidate for radioactive wasteland if you defend the planet at all (or not at all - someone could nuke you dead simply because they couldn\'t defend you if they took you).

I guess it depends, as always, on the nature of the foe and the nature of the expected conflict.

It isn\'t all that difficult to be a good GM and be careful about giving out
heaps of SOC for no reason.  In addition to this, there is actually an
experience system in T4 (and T4.1).  I doubt that Marc instituted the
"spending rule" so that every character could make big money and become dukes
and such.

A GM shouldn\'t have to have detailed rules for _everything_.  That\'s why we
call it _role_ playing, not roll playing.  SOC is a measure of ones social
clout in Imperial society.  A great work of art (which there are rules for in
Trav), and the networking involved to raise your SOC (the money spent on the
right clothes, the right people, the right parties) could raise it, if you had
the experience points to spend to do so.

And so on...  Besides, a statue of a urinating Einstein is class in my book!

Nope. Mass detectors detect exactly that. They are inherently 3d. Just
like using a compass on a steel ship, you "calbrate" the sensor after
installation so as to compensate for the "fixed" mass of the ship. 

Cargo and supplies will be added to the database as they are loaded.
And this is where many a smuggler/stoaway gets caught. The manifest
entry says the module is one thing, but the detector says that the mass

This gives every ship with mass detectors 100% accurate internal sensors...something to keep in mind when writing "Intruder on Board" style scenarios.

I\'m imagining a warship straining with every passive sensor to detect a hostile craft. The crew doesn\'t move, doesn\'t dare breathe, so the mass detectors can use all their computing power looking for the bad guy instead of compensating for the crew movements...would kind of give you the tense feeling like those old WWII movies, with the submarine crew holding their breath as the enemy destroyer comes closer...

Many moons ago there was a "Thieves\' World" boxed set put out that covered
many game systems, including Traveller (CT).

The magic aspect of the setting was handled by either Psionics or the Niven
Rule.  

Under the Niven rule, this lead to interesting plot devices.  How did the
wizards get the high tech items?  Are there current traders landing and
trading high tech items?  What items of value are the local wizards trading
for high tech items?  What lengths will the traders and wizards go to
maintain their trade?

A friend picked up FF&S2 and opened to a particular page.  He saw a formula
that involved multiple level parentheses over (i.e. divided by) some other
formulaic construct and immediately putit down.

Now, I\'m not saying there should not be gearhead supplements.  But the
basic rulebook should go to great lengths to *oversimplify* die rolling
conventions used.  For this reason, I would advocate a simple 2d-2 which,
of course, bell curves toward the \'5\' level.  So what?  This simply means
that there are more worlds in the 10000s of people than any other single
distribution.  It also means \'0\' pop worlds and \'A\' pop worlds are unlikely
(all other aspects being equal).  If you remove this aspect you have as
many worlds with Billions as you do with none and that is just as bad a
problem.

Simplify!  You\'re not making a gearhead book your making a basic ruleset.
One thing that we are forgetting is that CT worked because it was simple.
We don\'t have ot use CT in its original form, but let\'s capture some of its
more attractive featires.

Other possibilities;

1). Artifacts leftover from an earlier civilization

2). Wizards are a group of elite technicians who hoard technical knowledge
and portray it as "Magic" (this falls apart quickly, unfortunately due to
the need for \'base\' technologies to support the kinds of advanced tech we
want).

3). As (2) but the source of parts and knowledge is offplanet, as you refer
to above.

>  What items of value are the local wizards trading
>for high tech items?

Good Question.  I would guess power.  Wizards under this scenario would
rule swaths of territory and occassionally be "from afar" (which means they
are immigrants from other planets who want to wield their power directly).
Others collect a lot of taxes in the form of, perhaps, gems and gold, which
have some value, or finished handmade goods, which at least would be worth
transporting.

The traders are basically selling "trinkets" so value doesn\'t have to be
tremendous.

>What lengths will the traders and wizards go to
>maintain their trade?

The traders?  Who cares, there\'s another planet down the line if this one
has too many problems.  The Wizards? The trade is their lifeblood, but if
they have enough toys for now they can get along (depending on where they
get their power and how durable their devices are wrt spares).

Interesting scenarios do tend to pop up though.

    Actually, I\'ve always taken the TL issues differently, especially
considering the Collapse.  In a TL15 (borderline 16) Imperium, is that TL9
world actually ignorant of where to go?  I don\'t think the TL system really
makes sense, considering that the lack of "direction" on "where to go" is a
big problem w/ r&d.  Alot of times it\'s just  that *hint* or nudge that can
push u over the edge to a new discovery.  
    I\'ve always taken it to mean that the world in question just wasn\'t
capable of sustaining that TL industry in meaningful quantities but that some
very small amount of production was possible, and indeed going on, but at
vastly enhanced costs and construction times.  What I mean is that there might
be a batman type guy out on that TL9 world using all sorts of higher tech
gadgets supported by his corporation (and not necessarily imported) and that
the Secret Service of said world can probably produce their own TL12 or 13
gear but probably just enough to equip maybe a couple hundred people.  
    As pertaining to the Collapse... I\'ve always thought that some knowledge
would never be lost.  Like the nuclear bomb... even if every nation on Earth
got rid of em, Saddam Hussein would still research them.  Once it\'s known
something is possible, everyone interested in that item would research it
until it\'s done.  A specialized factory and industry would be needed but it
wouldn\'t be needed on a planetary scale to produce a few items.  I think that
the RC would probably be able to produce amounts of technology items that
starts broad at tl12, narrows until it reaches very few TL 15 items (primarily
those that are incremental in TL advance) and most likely none of the Tl16 and
17 (experimental) items being researched by the 3I.
     In fact, I think that planets would probably fairly quickly rise to the
Imperiums TL if their population and industry (resources and infrastructure)
could support it.

Yes, I guess there is precedent for that; I forgot about COACC.  Also, the
fact that a sub-100 dt small craft can mount any turret is another example
of this.

That makes for a gruesome variant of the Valor class.  8-)

So that brings us back to the question:  how hard is it to locate a deep
meson site, and why?  (I.e. what is the "official" handwave?)  Once
located, it\'s a sitting duck for an enemy meson attack, even if equipped
with a meson screen.

Unless it\'s a really powerful meson screen.  Hmmmmm... I wonder how easy
it is for ships to do coordinated simultaneous attacks against a fixed
point inside a planetary body?  Would such attacks would confer any
benefit against a meson screen?

Agreed.  I was just jumping into the existing thread.  I\'m still a fan of
CT too.  The basic rulebook doesn\'t need a population multiplier, just a
population digit.  The referee filled in the blanks.

For more advanced rules, Leonard\'s second table is probably best.

One such plot: the "wizards" are unaware of the technological nature of
said "magics".

Consdier this, say you have an advanced civilisation. For convienence they
build machines and a world-net that is, effectively "all seeing".
Satelites, microcameras, whatever. (Who was going on about nanites?) All
capable of self-repair. Rather than being burdened with carrying anything,
they interpret voice or gesture commands. Like IBM\'s Via Voice, only higher
tech. Whatever someone needs something from it they indicate so and it
produces the stuff via underground (self-repairing) factories, or calls up
the information and displays it locally via micro-projectors.
[Sort of like the planet in the Classic Trek episode "Shore Leave".]
Well, odds are that these people aren\'t going to keep their technology for
very long. At least their knowledge of their technology. If they can all
self-repair, you don\'t need to know how they are build. Education would
move to focus on other things like philosophy, entertaint, etc, etc.
Over time, they may even get to the point where they forget the actual
reason why it exists.
Now say some calatamous event creates a situation that disturbs this
harmony. An asteroid, plague spread by dirty telephones, or whatever. If
the machines can\'t deal with it the continuity of their culture will be
lost. Some might remember how to call up the commands, but keep the
knowledge to themselves. To others, as the language changes, it appears
cryptic, archaic.
Magic in other words.

A slightly different twist would be that the civilisation who built it was
non-human. A human colony came and tried to oust them since they were
obviously primitive, having no machines. They succeeded in wiping them out
but at the expense of maintaining their own industry. In their degenerate
culture, some may have learned to communicate with the few remaining
aliens, and learned from them some of the alien commands to work the
miracles...

Plenty of opportunities for those with active imaginations...

Whats the Cr to US$ rate nowadays?1-1?  Egad!  I\'m Soc 4!
2-1?  Ack!  I\'m Soc 2!
And I\'m in law school, thats surely a negative modifier.

Hi.  My name is Bloo.  < Hi, Bloo!> And I\'m Soc sub-0.

Where\'s the 12 step program for low Soc?

But hold on a sec!  I was accepted to the US Naval Academy (turned it down
though).  That\'s SOC 8 minimum I think. And I sure didn\'t make it in on waivers.

Maybe this all means I need to spend a minimum of Cr2000 on food, clothes,
lodging,  basic entertainment, etc., to live in the manner deserving of those with
Soc 8.

Oh, Jeeves . . .

Yes, Master Bloo (hey, that sounds cool!).

Would you bring the bicycle to the front, I believe I\'ll take a tour of the
railway tracks in Brighton, Mass.  The rust glistens so lovely in the cold winter
light.

Certainly, Master Bloo.  May I ask what the Master would like for his evening

Yes, Jeeves.  Something special tonight, I should think.  Lets splurge!  You know
what I like.

Yes, Master Bloo.  Macaroni and Cheese it is, sir.

I have been known to rely on a deck of cards when the cat has made off with the
d6s.
BTW, shouldn\'t these different dice be deserving of names other than the simple
dx?  And not the geometrical terms like dodecahedron or whatever.  For example, a
six-sided die, known in short as "d6" might be called "Dixie."  D3  - either
"Half-Dixie,"  "Short Dixie" or the more unique "Dierdre" (from "dee-three").
D10?  "Dieter."  (now is the time on Sprockets with when Dance").

Depending upon the TL, my suits use either method. The first starts off
with rough spot colours, upgrades to very accurate emulation of background
(but with the disadvantage noted by Leonard above), then (hand wave) starts
using the sort of rounded emitters/screens that are being used for 3D TV
concepts, etc. to give a wider field of view over which the suit is
\'invisible\'. Eventually you get the fibre-sort of direct transfer approach
mentioned above which (hand wave hand wave) makes things better. However,
whatever the technology, such suits are far more effective in dim lighting
conditions when the user is immobile. I don\'t let \'invisible\' characters
wander freely through high security areas... :-)

Let me into this little debate....I would like to simply point one thing in
the whole 
world generation issue...use the tables to spur your creativity. Once the
world is
generated, play with the stats until you like them. You\'re the GM for
crying out loud.
(or else you wouldn\'t be rolling these things up in the first place)

If you decide that the other stats on a planet make more sense for a planet
of a billion
pop, then its a billion. If you decide that it does not make sense for a
planet with an A
starport to have a TL of 8 when there are two other planets within 2
parsecs with TL 10 or
higher, then go ahead and change the stats. My rule of thumb when GMing any
system
is that 90% of everything should not require a far reaching explanation.

I had the same question a few weeks ago and got the same vague
answers...then I found it:
Central Supply Catalog, Vehicle construction section (in the back)
pg 73 "Autofire" - summarized
- -  a Rapid fire (RF) weapon gets a +2 DM to autofire attacks, which mainly
helps offset range mods, and this classification corresponds to a ROF of
approximately 100 shots/turn
- - a VRF weapon gets a +4 Dm and figures in at about 200 shots/turn

FF&S2 mentions qualifying for these, it just doesn\'t explain what they do.
Now if we can just find a relevant explanation for the recoil number you
come up with...

This section of this supplement is one of the most useful sections in any of
the books so far. Notice in the main T4 rules that the combat section
referes to structural damage. Notice also that nowhere in that book (even in
the "vehicles" section) is there a stat for stucture, nor a
definition/formula on how to figure it. Guess where it is? Same section,
"Advanced Damage Chart" (and somewhere else too, I believe). Structure is
double the armor rating or "4", whichever is higher.

Of course this is all ignored in the "Emperor\'s Vehicles" wreck of a
book...which fails to list Tech Levels for all of the vehicles, structure
ratings, or weapons details for those vehicles which are armed. There\'s not
even a place for these items on their "vehicle form". Hard to believe that
didn\'t come up. My moderately hardware-oriented guys went nuts.

Hope this helps

  Can\'t a subterranean emplacement still be eliminated by a larger

with an absurdly large trade volume, made me think about a
simple, unrelated-to-other-systems rule of thumb to determine
trade volume between two worlds.

This is what Jon Buller and I came up with.

Starport	Volume
A		5
B		4
C		3
D		2
E		1
X		0

Population	Volume
9+		+2
6-8		+1
0-5		+0

TL		Volume
A+		+2
5-9		+1
0-4		+0

Feature		Volume
Naval Base	+2
Scout Base	+1	(is this necessary?)
XBoat Route	+1
Gas Giant	+2	(is this high?)
Interdicted	-3

So, this produces a value V from 0 to 15 for a world.

To find the traffic between two worlds:

	1. Calculate world values, V1 and V2.

	2. Subtract the distance D (in parsecs) between the worlds from
	   V1 and V2:

		Va = V1 - D
		Vb = V2 - D

	   If either value is less than 1, then there is no regular trade
	   between the worlds.

 	3. Index into the following table, using Va and Vb as row and
	   column indices:


Per week total freight factor traffic
       1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15

 8:    2    2    3    3    4    4    4    5    5    5    5    5    6    6    6 
 9:    2    3    3    4    4    4    5    5    5    5    6    6    6    6    6 
10:    2    3    3    4    4    4    5    5    5    6    6    6    6    6    7 
11:    2    3    3    4    4    5    5    5    6    6    6    6    6    7    7 
12:    2    3    4    4    4    5    5    5    6    6    6    6    7    7    7 
13:    2    3    4    4    5    5    5    6    6    6    6    7    7    7    7 
14:    2    3    4    4    5    5    5    6    6    6    7    7    7    7    8 
15:    2    3    4    4    5    5    6    6    6    7    7    7    7    8    8 


The indexed digit is similar to a population digit:
Digit	Passengers
1	10s
2	100s
3	1000s
4	10,000s
5	100,000s
6	millions
7	tens of millions
8	hundreds of millions

Freight is in tons, and generally is 4 x passenger count, though I\'m
sure it can vary quite a bit.



To determine total weekly capacity for a starport, find all routes
within, say, 3 parsecs from the starport.  The strongest route will
pretty much be the determinant, though additional ones may adjust
the final numbers some.



Example 1:

Capacity for Treece, Spinward Marches:
								     * VOL *
Treece        2311 D232866-8    Na Po              610 Im M1 V		 4
Yori          2110 C360757-A    Ri De              713 Im F1 V		 6
Inthe         2410 B575776-9  A Ag                 423 Im F8 V		11
Keanou        2411 C792348-7  S Lo Ni              213 Im M3 III M2 D	 5
Echiste       2313 C53A313-A    Lo Ni Wa           720 Im G4 V		 4

All right, Inthe is only 1 parsec distant, so we automatically know that
the traffic is almost completely to and from there.  So I\'m just doing
the calculations between Treece and Inthe:

V1 = 4, V2 = 11
Va = 4 - 1 = 3, Vb = 11 - 1 = 10

Cross-indexing 3 and 10 yields a 3: perhaps 1000 passengers per week
and 4000 tons per week between Inthe and Treece.


Example 2:

Capacity for Jae Tellona, Spinward Marches:
								     * VOL *
Jae Tellona   2814 A560565-8  N Ni De              913 Im F9 IV		11
Porozlo       2715 A867A74-B    Hi                 201 Im M1 V M9 D	11
Rhylanor      2716 A434934-F  A Hi Cp              810 Im M2 VI		12
Celepina      2913 B434456-9  A Ni                 201 Im M2 VI		11

Big trafficking going on here.  Porozlo is only 1 parsec away, which
means its trade system will probably dominate.

Jae Tellona <--> Porozlo:	10 & 10 = millions of pass. & freight
Jae Tellona <--> Rhylanor:      9  & 10 = 100,000s of pass. & freight
Jae Tellona <--> Celepina:	9  &  9 = 100,000s of pass. & freight

So, many times the population of Jae Tellona\'s mainworld is passing
through Jae Tellona\'s starport each week!  Ouch!

Now, how would you divide cargo up between ships?  I guess I would
split it up from large lots down to small ones:

Liner/Freighter		Passenger Cap (low?)
...............         ....................
Massive			100,000
Huge			10,000		
Large			1000		
Medium (600t)		100	
Small (200t)		10	
Courier (100t)		1	

Method: assign the larger ships first, and when the remainder
	of the starport capacity soon will fall below capacity for 
	that class of ship, move to the next smaller ship size and
	work on the remainder, etc.

Example: the Rhylanor-Porozlo run, 1 parsec
								     * VOL *
Rhylanor      2716 A434934-F  A Hi Cp              810 Im M2 VI		12
Porozlo       2715 A867A74-B    Hi                 201 Im M1 V M9 D	11

Rhylanor <--> Porozlo = 11 & 10: millions of passengers & freight

Let\'s say 2,000,000 passengers and 8,000,000 tons of freight.

Transport	Pass	Freight
Massive x 18	1.8 M	7.2 M
Huge x 18	180,000 720,000
Large x 18	18,000	72,000
Medium x 18	1800	7200
Small x 18	180	720
Courier x 18	18	72

In such an even-distribution case, then, we have 100+ ships arriving
each week.

Class A groundports can handle 500+ ships 1000 tons or less, giving
us a weekly downport capacity of

500 ships x 60 passengers/ship = 30,000 passengers per week
500 ships x 240 t freight/ship = 120,000 tons freight per week

Class B groundports can handle 200+ ships 1000 tons or less, giving
us a weekly downport capacity of

200 ships x 60 passengers/ship = 12,000 passengers per week
200 ships x 240 t freight/ship = 48,000 tons freight per week

Now, suppose you just want to know what\'s available for your little
sub-1000t ship for a year\'s worth of trade?  Well, here\'s the table
to index for that:

Again, the indexed digit is the number of zeroes.  So if you were able
to trade for a year on the Porozlo-Rhylanor run, you would be able to
move between 10,000 and 99,000 passengers and run between 10,000 and
99,000 tons of cargo (maybe 15,000 passengers and 60,000 tons of goodies).


So send us your input, critique, questions, and improvements.
The primary consideration was ease of use (next to plausibility,
of course).  This is version 1.0.

Hans seeing as the Vilani are a figment of our imaginations and "Lite
Brite" is a reality, although a quite passe reality, it does make a
difference.  ;-> The Solomani, at least, deserve recognition as independent
creators of the medium. Actually, I suspect Hasbro might *insist* on
recognition. ;->

As for famous "Lite Brite" artists, I\'m sure we can make up a few names,
complete with titles of their works. ;->  In fact, a few children of the
70\'s that grew up with "Lite Brite" just might *eventually* produce a few
real works of art in the plastic (or glass) rod medium.  You never know.

  I tend to agree, but the background as written is the hand we\'ve
been dealt. Also, the TL system is a lot of use when listing worlds
and trying to figure out the backwaters - most cyberpunk games (or
the 2300 approach) would force a GM to invent their own scale or do
write-ups for each world. The Trav TL is a labour-saving shorthand.

  Depends on whether the 3I has development assistance programs, or
if it considers such its\' job or not. As for trade serving that same
purpose, we don\'t know. Economists have names for their schools of
thought, and not all of them believe (with some justification) that
trade will help economies that are too far behind their contemporaries.

The something else you speak of is, I believe, acceptance by the people
or class you are trying to impress. I also believe that was what was
intended by the author of the original post. If this is the case then we
all agree.

I wonder if everyone accepts that greatness is measured by how much one
spends. Again, I don\'t want to start a war here, but I wonder if, by
news reports anyway, the people of Iraq consider Sadam as a great person
and deserving of his SOCial status. He evidently is not *spending* any
of the money to to alleviate the suffering of the people, but I believe
he is *spending* on those who keep him in power. Princess Di was noted
for her humanitarian works, I believe, and not how much she spent,
although she probably contributed considerably to her causes.

Let\'s say I have been around a bunch of them when they were showing

Yep, that is a probable result from what you describe, but as a visitor

I should have put a smiley there. B-) I am just a bit angry at the media
fuss about "smart bombs" when most of the bombings were conducted using
B-52s and other dumb bombs.

I read an interesting article a few days ago, it said that about seven per
cent of bombs used in the Gulf War were smart... and about 95 per cent of
the news from the war adsvertised the samrt weapons..

This planet has a thin atmospere and a slow rotation.  Therefore it gets
_really_ hot at midday.  It was the custom on this planet for citizens
to go home at midday for a long lunch.  However the local criminal
element used this opportunity to commit lots of burgluaries of unguardrd
businesses.  The people of this world decided that they could not allow
their criminals to be wandering around loose unsuperviesd during the
midday period.  They decided that if all their convicted criminals were
home sleeping they could not be committing crimes & so this custom
developed. (I know that a siesta does not axiomatically require sleep,
but sleep ins the popular American conception of a siesta, so this is
what I suggest.)

Ah, so we see the truth behind the First Intersteller War: the Vilani 
tried to enforce their patent laws ("We don\'t care how you got it.  
Makhidkarun developed it 6000 years ago, and it belongs to them, plus

I parially agree with you.  As a GM  I  run  a  very  rules  lite
campaign and try to focus the players  as  much  as  possible  on
_role_ playing.  (Once, during a murder investigation, my players
verbally interrogated an NPC for 3 hours real time ...  remaining
in character the whole time.  Playing that NPC  was  one  of  the
most satisfying ... and most stressful  ...  tasks  I\'ve  had  to
perform as a GM.)  But between sessions I study up on the  rules.
Not so that I can use them  strictly  in  play,  but  so  that  I
understand how and why things work, the relationships, etc.  Then
(hopefully) I can improvise more plausably.

However ...

Not really.  I keep looking at En  Guarde  (and  an  expanded  En
Guarde PBM rule book) and thinking it would  be  neat  to  do  an
Imperial Court campaign at the time of Strephon\'s  assassination.
I would like to do it soon, but would like to see "Nobles" first.

Well, considering the controls on the press during the Gulf war, it\'s not
surprising that the news coverage turned out like it did.

However, much of the coverage of the bombing was also concentrated on the
effects of the bombing on the interior of Iraq, like Bagdhad where a much
higher percentage of the \'smart\' bombs were used. IIRC the B52\'s were used
to blow large holes in the sand where the Iraqi troops were. Since there
wasn\'t nifty gun camera footage of a scared trucker escaping off the
bridge, and no one in their right mind gets close enough to a heavy-duty
B52 carpet bombing using HE and FAE\'s to film it and live, and the press
wasn\'t allowed near the front anyway, there wasn\'t much _to_ cover.

Also, those  kinds of missions are perfectly well handled by \'dumb\' bombs.

Besides, much of that coverage was designed to reassure the taxpayers that
they were indeed getting their money\'s worth from the huge Reagan-era
defense budgets..."See...all the really expensive stuff worked!" 

Far more troublesome were the outright lies regaring the efficacy of many
of the weapons systems used in the war. To reiterate one of the more well
known ones, those amazing Patriots may not have actually shot down more
than one or two SCUDs, if any at all. Much of the evidence indicates that
the SCUDs were doing a pretty good job of falling apart all on their own
and that the patriots were simply a showier way of lighting up the sky
than all the ineffective flak over Bagdhad.

In retrospect, not surprising at all for a weapons system that was
designed to be an anti-aircraft weapon, not an anti-ballistic missile
defense. 

Also, remember, much of the press coverage of the war was manipulated to
the strategic and tactical ends of the Allied commanders.

obTrav: How much control will Imperial forces have over press coverage of
their battlefields? How often will \'news\' sources in the very 19th century
Imperialist 3I be mouthpieces for the powers that be? Look at the role of
newspapers in many events in the late 19th-early 20th Century. Take the
Spanish-American war...as much of the impetus for the war was stirred up
by Hearst\'s newspapers as by any politician

Yes Yes Yes!  All this stealth stuff is just intended to be background.  If
the place is for-real in terms of security it will take some role
playing/plot development to get into, not some fancy technology. Not that
fancy tech will hurt either (usually).

And if characters have the perfect defense against ultrasonic radar in
their aresenal of techno-tricks, they won\'t encounter another such radar
until their suit is in the shop anyway, right?

You make a good point, the stats/rolls are for guidance, not for 100%
definition.  However, you can bet that soon after there are new generation
rules out there, there will also be a computer program made to generate
hundreds of worlds using those rules.

Hmmm, that seems to advocate the opposite of what I was saying above.  With
a computer  program to do this stuff the tendancy should probably move
towards more complicated and more playable planetary stats than those in
CT.  Personally, I have never generated a single planet by hand rolling D6s
in 15 years of traveller.  I have generated my own planets, but using some
piece of software, not my poor tired fingers, and always a sector or
subsector at a time.

Regardless of these thoughts, we are going to get (If my Millermeter is
reading correctly) a CT-like system for world generation.  That means D6s
(maybe d3s), and I still advocate keeping complex formulas (anything more
complex than 2d6-2) out of the T4.1 basic rulebook.

As long as we are on the subject.  If there were a new version of "Scouts"
anytime in the future, it would be much more convenient if the system
produced planetary temperatures that weren\'t either frozen iceballs or
steaming hothouses.

    'body' => '>  I don\'t think the TL system really makes sense

I disagree, I think the traveller TL variation between worlds is 
belevable.  Just look at the TL variation on our own world - often 
within countries.

It is only 10 or so years ago that my Walkman and compact 35mm 
camera caused a stir in rural Portugal - I was visiting a friend who 
teaches English there.  The people in the big city were used to 
tourists, and many owned similar high-tech toys, but 2 hours away by 
bus and the world was 50 years younger :-)

Look at the TL drop in Iran (IMO) since trade with the high TL west 
dropped of following the revolution.

Look at the TL in the foothills of Mount Everest - these people see 
more film crews, helicopters and high-tech climbing gear than almost 
anyone else, yet they use traditional (TL 3? TL 4?) methods for their 
farming, shoe repair, climbing and so on.


Where the traveller TL system does not fit my view is the relationship 
between capabilities and inventions.  In the Third Imperium, 
particularly 1100, there will be low-tech worlds that have cellular 
radios - as Leonard Erickson pointed out while correcting me:

> Anyplace that gets visited regularly by ships *will* have radios or 
> satellite phone equivalents. *Especially* when folks are several 
> days travel apart.

The official TL progression moves through the years very quickly in the 
middle (and this is also reflected in Pocket Empires in the time taken 
to move up a TL) - but this reflects (IMO) a period of great 
inventiveness as the number of scientists grew, as R&D was able to / 
forced to investigate new areas, as people got better overall 
education.  As others have mentioned on several occasions, the 
traveller TL tree can be seen more as "invention" driven, rather than 
"capability" driven.

When Traveller was first written, before any background informtion was 
published, it seemed reasonable to have an "invention" based TL tree - 
each world would develop in relative isolation, and someone had to 
invent the wheel on each world.  In the 3I, where inventions are more 
often a matter of historical knowledge, the TL can be used to measure 
how technologically capable a society is - but the TL tables do not 
reflect this.

An example: Greg Porter (of 3G3 fame) has argued that Imerial Rome had 
the science to build sub-machine guns - if someone went and explained 
the correct metals to use, mercury percussion caps to ignite cordite to 
set off gunpower in brass bullet casings and so on ... their chemistry 
was good enough to make all the individual items in the cartidge, 
their metalworking was good enough for the bullet and (probably) the 
gun, with just a few new techniques for making gun metal.  So, what TL 
should a machine gun be?

As you move up the TL tree, the required infrastructure gets greater to 
make things (modern micro-chips and their billion-dollar fabs), and TL 
could therefore be a measure of how much of this infrastructure you 
have on a given world.  Unfortunately, that simple model fails when you 
look at small high tech communities (belters, colonies, research 
station gamma, etc).

All of this boils down to the fact that TL means different things to 
different worlds (and to different referees).  Some of us like to have 
big differences between the major races (genetics for the Rule of Man, 
Imperial missile tech vs terran beam weapons, hiver computers, and so 
on).  Many people seem to argue that after a few 1000 years of space 
faring everyone will have "agreed" that only meson guns and particle 
beams make sense as spinal weapons and that fighters are useless 
against capital ships.  World history makes me doubt this.  I think 
that racial pride, the inertia of tradition and many other factors will 
add greater diversity to the tech used by the major races and by 
individual planets within each empire.

I\'ll stop for now, as i\'ll soon start ranting about IMTU.

I have not had time yet to analyse the earlier suggestions (including

the trade volumes between any pair of worlds ... a nice "background

In pocket empires, the quality of trading partners has no effect on the

Great job on the Starport Economics.  Some comments.

1)  I think the values used for the volume of trade and passengers should
represent an annual capacity rather than a weekly capacity.  As an Aviation
Safety Engineer and a member of AAAE, we view the capacity of an airport as
annual capacity, and use this value to determine economic value etc. in the
community.  Yes, as you have calculated, the "population" of a community can
transit through a starport (airport) several times over in a year.

2)  I think you should use the values you index as "passenger values" rather
than freight and divide your total passengers by a factor of fifty to get
your cargo carried in annual tonnes, rather than cargo being 4x the
passenger value.  Economic cargo capacity is usually a lot lower number when
compared to passenger capacity.  I am not taking into account the handling
of baggage or mail in that cargo.

3)  I would delete the "Gas Giant" modifier and increase the "XBoat"
modifier to  "+2".  I would also add in a TL modifier for "TL D+  @  +3".  I
don\'t see a gas giant as having great impact on trade, yet higher TL would
be more of a reason to trade with a world.

Thanks for a good read.

Metabolism of all known races relies on electromagnetic interchanges
(aka chemical reactions). Manipulation of strong or weak forces will
have no effect on these. The manipulations *may* cause energy releases
or particle radiation due to forced decay of isotopes, or transmutation
of elements. Those will adversely effect life forms.

Stong and weak force only apply *inside* the nucleues. So they aren\'t
going to affect any kind of decay except radiactive.

The filters don\'t "point". They merely screen out *large molecules (see

It\'s already used on a small scale. They fill cables and conduits, and
if you cut the outer casing to get at the wires, the pressure drop sets
off alarms.

And as I noted, it\'s more appropriate for a *storage* facilitiy.
Strangely, players seem to want to steall from such facilities. Funyy
how that works out. :-)

Well, it\'s like fingerprints or hair samples or any of a dozen of other
things. detecting the presence of a given molecule won\'t id you. But
get several types IDed along with the ratios between them, and you\'ve
got the equivalent of a multi-point fingerprint match.

Sometimes they don\'t *need to do those things. Why pick they lock on
the file cabinet if you are small enough to walk through the crack

I dunno. I don\'t think that the presence of forward observers in a city
necessarily make the city a target. Anybody know for sure if unarmed
spotters, especially civilian ones, convert their surroundings into a
legit target?

It gets even messier when you realize that the sensors may have
perfectly legit *civilian* uses, things like traffic control. So if
they merely "broadcast" their reading over the data grid, are they
actually acting as spotters?

Sorry, but holograms *don\'t* work that way. And the "chameleon suits"
were explicitly described as changing the color of the surface. 

With holograms, you wind up with a different, but similar type of
problem. A hologram is essentially a *window* into a scene. Thus it too
is directionally limited. Also, holograms *don\'t* give true 3-d. Sure,
if you move to the left, you can now see something that was behind a
"closer" object. Try doing that by moving *up* to look *over* the
object. You may get a surprise.

Which is why you just tell the missile your best data on the course,
speed, and likely future maneuvers so that it can figure the course
change on it\'s own.

Heck, you can do that by encrypted "broadcast" and ;let the missiles
decide what the best target is. This lets you use cheap *radio*.

Sure, but if I\'m sitting in solid rock, I\'d want the meson screen a few
hundred meters *out* from the installation. That way I still have to
deal with shock waves, but any radiation has to get thru more than a
hundred meters of rock (not gonna happen!).

The rock surrounding the installation might melt. That\'s why I figure
that subterrenes will be built. Being built to operate in molten rock
*already*, all the extra energy will do is make the rock easier to move
through. :-)

Not 100%. People are rather low density, thus not the strongest signal
around. On the other hand, it *does* mean that they\'ll notice that
*somebody* is moving around in the cargo hold when no one is expected
to be there. It\'s not much worse than having motion sensors all over,
just more accurate and harder to spoof.

Yeah. Since the inverse square law *does* apply, that means that a
crewman at 1 meter gives off a signal as strong as a million ton object
considerably farther away. Luckily, since they\'ll be *between* the
elements of the detector, it\'s a lot more practical to screen out the
crew. :-)

Tracking stuff inboard is probably enough of a pain that they\'d pretty
much use it just for cargo checks, and as an alarm to indicate when
there are people where *no one* is supposed to be. Noticing that there
are 7 people in engineering and there should only be 6 is not going to
happen unless they start *looking* for anomalies.

Nathler took a speeder to the starport.  He was early for the
arrival of his third 600t liner (purchased with cash, not
financed), and he was excited.  His business had found the most
unlikely but lucrative niche in the huge trade business between
Rhylanor and Porozlo, and he was now richer than the ancient 
Solomani god-man Byll Gaites.

This groundport covered 100+ square kilometers, and was busy
night and day.  There were 48 public parkbays, serving over
500 ships per week.  In addition, there was the shuttle service
parkbay, which every hour brought thousands of people down to
the surface and took another batch up to the orbital base.

The groundport bustled with activity, even at this time of the
morning.  Nathler\'s speeder cab took him though the outer gates
into Startown, past the inner gates into the shipyards, where
warehouses, construction yards and repair docks were stacked
in efficient (if messy) sections, like piles of toy blocks.
The speeder stopped inside the inner gates, and security checked
him and sent the speeder away.  Nathler showed his GravPass
to the parkbay passenger magrail system datanet, and took a seat 
in the closest car.

Nathler\'s last liner was constructed on Porozlo, due to trade
agreements, contracts, and administrative red tape.  He wanted
to be there when it set down in Rhylanor after its shakedown.
As of late, Nathler hadn\'t spent much time on the business,
leaving it in the capable hands of his well-educated staff.
However, this was a big occasion, and he went out of his way
on big occasions.

After a short wait, there she was.  The clean, new 600t liner
sailed down on never-before-used glide wings onto the northern
landing strip, a 5-kilometer long stretch of paved, packed, 
reinforced road.  At the end of the strip, she was turned by
a surface grav tug and lifted onto the parkbay ship magrail 
system, where she would be pigeonholed in a berth somewhere in the
parkbay system -- hopefully on one of the northern bays.

Nathler gave the datanet his ship identification, and in a moment
the car swung about the magrail, stopping occasionally to let
others on or off.  Soon he would see his ship eye to eye.

- ----

Large shuttles are needed on high capacity ground starports...
Groundports which see 1,000,000 passegners per week (perhaps half
of the orbital port\'s traffic) must handle 143,000 passenger 
arrival+departures per day, 70,000 passengers each way -- about 
3000 passengers per trip per hour.  

If one assumes a peak time of 5000 passengers, and if one also 
assumes the fleet should have a total capacity of ~10,000  
passengers, one needs, say:

	10 700-passenger shuttles	7000 passengers 
	36 70-passenger shuttles	2520 passengers
	11 7-passenger shuttles		  77 passengers

So one has a fleet of 57 shuttles, capable of a glide landing, and 
having their own set of 6 parkbays (for a total of 66 ground berths).

The relationships between the nobles and such is one thing, but I for one, am
very much against the whole \'spending money to gain SOC\' thing.  It\'s alot
more than that in our world.

A number of different things could raise (or lower) one\'s SOC, and then to
further hypothesize that SOC is a measure of one\'s standing in Imperial
society, and realizing that the Imperial ethic is based on responsibility and
honor...  It doesn\'t seem like money alone should cut it.

Things that could raise SOC:
- - coming up with a breakthrough in a discipline
- - creating a great work of art (or funding and \'producing\' that work of art)
- - creating a hit or great piece of music (or funding it)
- - making a lot of money in a certain field

These things are just a small sampling of some of the \'SOC-raisers\' other than
money.  There are others too, being a crime boss is one example, marrying into
a family and becoming accepted into a higher SOC is another.  (The character
with the highest SOC in my campaign is a criminal, born and bred.)

I\'d rather not complicate the SOC system (at least in my campaign) by adding a
thousand new elements to it.  I think that, when all is said and done, if the
characters want to attempt a hike in SOC, that the GM should have the final
say, and not the rule book.

"What do you mean I can\'t raise my SOC by spending Cr250*SOC to gain a level?
It says so right here in the book!"

These are quite a few berths, but will seem less when they are scattered all
over the planet. Tourist resorts, commercial centers, commuter transit network
hubs - in short, the places that generate this traffic flow in the first
place - will have subsidiary starport facilities.

CT Traveller Book 6?: Scouts mentions Spaceports as well as Starports, and CT
Traders & Gunboats mentions that the launch on the Sub Merchant often call for
passengers on hotel landing pads, bypassing the Starport all together.

While Columbia may get by with only one International Airport, the United
States needs a couple dozen - I think Starports will be the same way.

The guy whose head you\'re calling arty onto will definitely class you as a target...and depending on the circumstances, you could even be executed as a spy (military activities of a covert nature while passing oneself off as a civilian).

A FO post is a legit target, whether or not they are armed is irrelevant.

To be fair, smart bombs are a lot more interesting and the military was
being a bit deceptive about the effectiveness and use of smart bombs.
Personally, I don\'t have a problem with that... the enemy was watching
the news, too...

I don\'t have my book with me, but I think this is listed in the Referee\'s
Guide in the Starship Combat section, under the subheading Black Globes. I
do recall that one CT energy point is 250 Mw, though, and that the values
from the MT vehicle construction system are derived from the CT percentages
pretty directly. For example, a j6 drive is something like 7 percent a
ship\'s displacement in CT. In MT, a jump unit requires 13.5 kl in MT (which
happens to be 1 percent a 100 ton ship\'s 1350 kl volume) and it takes 7
jump units to get j6 -- thus, 7 percent, as in CT.

>FYI ... [chop]

I thought you *could* power systems off of absorbed energy, according to
the rules.

I started converting En Garde when I was writing the political stuff for
the M:0 book but I put it aside because I didn\'t have time to do it and
eveything else I was writing justice - of course, if I\'d known they
wouldn\'t want the Vargr stuff, I could have finished it.

I have to go visit the outlaws (er... in-laws) this weekend, but I\'ll
dig through my notes next week and see if I still have it.

There was also an article in an early Challenge (around issue 33 or so,
I think) where the characters were students in a military academy, which
had rules for this sort of thing. It might be easier to convert that, as
it already uses Traveller rules.

I\'m new to Traveller, and the mailing list, and my first question is
about Traveller Fusion Powerplants.

Why would they ever need refuelling?

Presumptions:
1.  D = deuterium
2.  Deuterium will be stored as water, D2O.
3.  Fusion: 2D -> 1He, mass deficiency ~ 0.306 AMU.
4.  E=mc^2
5.  0.306g -> 2.75 x 10^16 joules.
6.  1 joule = 1 watt-second
7.  A 1000 Mw powerplant will need 22.9g of D2O per year at 100% efficiency.
8.  If the 1000 Mw powerplant is 0.1% efficient in its use of
deuterium, it will need 22,900g of D2O per year - or 22.9 liters, this
works out to 2290 Kg of D2O per century per 1000 Mw of powerplant
output.
9.  It\'s late, I\'m tired, and I have probably made mistakes in my
calculations.  Feel free to correct any you find. :)

I don\'t see why fusion powerplants should need to be refueled more
than once a decade, or even less often.  Enough fuel can be built into
the powerplant to power it for decades, or even centuries.

Not a bad suggestion, IMO.

I\'m always like the *idea* of JOT, but never how it was implemented. It
seems to either end up being too powerful or too whimpy as a skill. 
Maybe having a "Generalist" (or Jack of all trades) career *is* the way
to go.

The Generalist, perhaps, gets few skills per term, but can freely choose
which skills he picks up from *any* table.  Because the JOT is "master
of none), he has an upper limit on the number of level he can earn in
any skill.  This would allow the creation of a PC with a very broad, but
shallow, range of skills...and that *is* how I see the JOT.

What say, you all?

                  Rapid Cold Start for TL16 Fusion Power Plants

                              by Stuart Machin

      At tech level 16, the understanding of fusion technology becomes complete and
it reaches the true physical limits. As part of this, a full comprehension of the
start up procedures becomes apparent. 

      It can be seen at this tech level than cold starts can take place much
quicker. This can be done through a sophisticated process involving the containment
of semi-fusion Hydrogen within a magnetic/gravitic bottle. This bottle is stable as
long as power is supplied, and holds within it sufficient charge to engage a
normally cold power plant as if it was warm. 

      This semi-fusion supply acts as a pre-warm up catalyst that speeds up the
cold start process to that of the warm process. This increase in speed is partially
due the fact that a fusion state does not have to be set within the power plant as
it is already present from the stored bottle. Also, with the semi-fusionized
Hydrogen present, the power plant gets a considerable head start in its climb to
standard operating temperature.

      What is the effect on the design of the vessel?

This concept can only be fitted to vessels at TL16+ with fusion power plants.
All volumes etc. are per  one kilolitre of power plant. 

                  Volume  Weight Power(Mw)# Price(MCr)
Fast Cold Start    0.03   0.06    0.21       0.06
 
#From some other power source

      The energy bottle is not very stable, and all TL16+ starports will require
the discharging of all fast cold start bottles before docking/landing. This
potential instability will occur occasionally (12 on 2D), and on these occasions a
task must be made:

         Routine,Engineer,Edu,10 secs(Fateful,Hazardous)

      If the roll is made, the start will occur in the normal cold start time. If a
mishap other than destroyed occurs, start up will take twice  the normal cold start
up time. If a destroyed result occurs, the power plant melts to slag, and on a 8+
on 2D, the resulting heat shock will disintegrate the ship. Worsen the difficulty
by one level for every month the bottle is not discharged and cleared for at least
24 hours. If this cleaning process is carried out every week, the task becomes
simple. If a vehicle is still using fusion power at tech level 18+, this
instability problem is cured.Traveller-digest     Thursday, February 26 1998     Volume 1998 : Number 223

I suspect 5G is excessive - turnaround time will be dominated by loading/
unloading, traffic, etc. (After all, it takes 2G only ~10 minutes to 
reach orbit and orbital velocity.) Since the T-plates dominate the cost,
this could save a bucket of money.

Alternative designs (without wings) that take off/land vertically would
be useful for some situations, as they don\'t need runways.

nothing that says you can\'t do the following:

1) assume that all powerplant fuel lasts for 10 years or so.

2) assume that all jump fuel expenditures are kept as they are

    'body' => '>The value of an escort would be altered by several factors;
I agree that these are things that should be taken into account, I think
they are really only "modifiers" to the base value.
The base value is determined by the cost of an escort. Look at it this way.
An escort has to pay for itself to stay in business. They have monthly
payments (usually) just like any other. At a minimum, they have to meet
their payments. If there is a segment where ships can\'t afford to pay
enough to enable them to meet those payments, then the escorts won\'t serve
it. (If they do, they will go out of business quickly enough.) Therefore,
the ships must either conduct their business unescorted, or else pay what
they need to pay to keep the escorts in business.

So this works into something like as follows.
You might as well take the Imperial baseline escort tonnage to merchant
tonnage to be 1:10. Work in
>2). Amount of hostile activity in the area
as a modifier. If the piracy level is above the Imperial norm, make it 1:6
or 1:8. Or if it is quite peaceful amke it 1:12 or 1:14. Additionally I
would add
*Naval presence in the area.
If there is more of a naval presence here, move it down to 1:12 or 1:14. Or
just work the Naval tonnage into the amount required.

Take, say, the cost of a bog-standard Escort out of the books, and derive a
figure representing their bi-weekly costs (the basic unit of escorting?).
Divide this by the proportion above to get a cost per ton of merchant.
This can be modified by
>3). Reputation of the Escort
An escort with a good reputation might get up to, say twice the figure. One
who is unknown might get 80%. An Escort with over-the-top machinery, or
ex-Navy officers with distinguished active service records might be able to
get more.

>1). Profitability of one run to the intended destination
This should only be a factor with regards to whether there are merchants
available to escort, or not. This should not affect the price. If there is
no one willing to pay the minimum an escort needs to stay in business,
there will be no escorts there. It makes no sense to pick up a contract for
less than your sustenence cost.

>4). Armament of the ship to be escorted
This can be worked easiest as a modifier to the "size" of the merchant
ship. Say a 400t merchant ship with really good armaments, might only pay
as if it was a 300t merchant. Similarly, a merchant with _no_ armament
(like it is under repair) might pay as if it were twice the size it is.

>The number of ships signed on to be escorted (i.e. the size of the convoy)
>can be as large as the escort captain is willing to risk,
I\'d stick to the derived proportion above. These figure can be upgraded
from a game mechanic to a "travel advisory rating" by the local Merchant
Marine and thus be accessible to the players as a negotiating poitn. If you
are over-escorting, (Ie. less escort tonnage than the local advisorary)
then the ships have an excuse to pay you less. If you are under escorting
(a bigger escort tonnage than would otherwise be required) the escort has
an excuse to charge more for being taken out of its way.


Lets look at a worked example. Lets assume that we have a ship, The Brusied
Petunia, running an escort service in District 268 in the Spinward Marches.
This is not an official Imperial area, but it is on the Spinward Main.
There are a fair few pirates but as the fifth frontier war has just ended
there are also Naval ships up and about the place. So lets say that overall
local travel advisories reccomend a 8:1 escort ratio.
Now, the only figures I have to hand are for some optimised Megatraveller
designs. A close escort is 255MCr, and clocks in at 336t. That\'s a monthly
payment of 1.05MCr, or 531KCr biweekly. Divide by its size to get a cost of
1.58KCr per ton of escort, or, dividing again and rounding, 200Cr per ton
of merchanter.
So the Bruised Petunia isn\'t really known here and has a silly name, so the
merchants it talks to are only prepared to offer it 150Cr per ton. It is
400t and can, in theory, escort 3200t of ships. So it talks to a 200t far
trader and a 3000t liner. The 200t trader is normal and is prepared, after
negotiations to pay 30KCr for the service. The liner has a PA turret or two
so is fairly comfortable (DM rules that it counts as being 2800t), and will
only pay 420K.
The Bruised Petunia only cost 127MCr, which is 264K biweekly, so is getting
off well. In fact, I\'m using the Corsair stats for the Bruised Petunia!

Well, the Master of None can be implemented by making it VERY difficult to pick
up the next term. Or maybe difficult to get promoted or something along those
lines.  That keeps the JOT career standard compared to the other careers, i.e.
no special rules.

Since starship powerplants use the same fuel for jump drives and HEPlaR
reaction mass, I never really thought it mattered.  In essence, everytime
you refueled your jump fuel, you refueled you powerplant.

    IF a standardized container system does exist in the Imperium then ships
will be designed to take advantage of it.  Even down to the glorified pickup

It does say ...

- - Each kiloliter of energy sink will hold 650 "megawatts" of raw,
  low level energy.

- - A ship without additional energy  sinks  installed  has  energy
  sinks (for the jump drive) equal to:
      Volume of the Ship in Kiloliters x Jump Number x 0.005

This seems to match with CT.  CT also said  that  1  displacement
ton costs MCr4, which works out to Cr296296 per kiloliter  (About
Mcr0.3?) but what is the weight per kiloliter?

    'body' => 'Speculative cargo for small ships
=================================

I\'ve now had some time to analyse your message, and I think the main 
trade levels are about right (see my next message on the TML).  
The freight levels for small ships (i.e you are paid Cr1000/T 
to carry goods owned by someone else) are OK, but I think they 
give too little cargo on low-trade routes.

I think that both speculative cargo (that the ship\'s captain buys) and 
freight will have all sorts of strange variations - nicely simulated by 
the trade rules in CT (or rules set of your choice).  

Example 1 - the ship may be in port in time to buy the surplus from a 
good harvest on farmer Jim\'s place - he filled his regular commitment 
to Tukera and wants to sell the surplus so that he can invest in a new 
combine harvester / put money aside for penalty payments during lean 
years / send his daughter to Naval Acadamy / buy a new R2 unit to 
maintain the \'vaporators / whatever.

Example 2 - the Tukera lines ship has suffered a problem and will be 
delayed for a few days.  Several passengers are insisting that they 
must leave today.  The Tukera captain will approach the ship and offer 
to pay the passage fees for these passengers - and even loan a steward 
if the ship does not have one.

Example 3 - Free trader Jake has just got a sweet deal on selling his 
combine harvesters, but the payment was in tons of grain - more than he 
can fit on his ship.  He needs to find another trader to take the grain 
(either as freight or cargo).

These examples of small-lot goods will happen on all worlds - on worlds 
with a high trade level there will be more opportunities but also more 
competition from other free traders.  therefore, i suggest you scrap 
the "per year freight factors" table and go back to the old ways.

    'month' => '02',
    'body' => 'While analysing the trade levels in PE (to comment on Rob Eaglestones\'s 
starport economics), I also took the opportunity to look at the cost 
and size of fleets for use in PE/IS games.

I looked at Olny (in IS) and Khuir (in PE) for comparisons and made 
some estimates on Olny\'s fleet for PE.  Here are the results:

Discretionary Budget = Gov budget - Civilian Expenses - 300
(the 300 RU is more than enough to pay your normal level of 
improvements toward TL, colony expansion, infrastructure improvement 
and so on).

Khuir has a Discretionary Budget (DB) of 1250 RU.
Total forces (TL 9) - PE page 81
AF 56
DF 66
jump 41
transport 24
Cost = 57,190 RU (those TL 9 attack factors cost a lot)
This would take 46 years to buy using the DB and has a maintenace 
budget of 561 RU (about half the DB)

The jump-capable fleet is size 82 (246 RU maintenace budget)
SDB fleet is same Attack + Defense strength as the jump fleet.

Now, I think that the total forces are a reasonable size, based on the 
maintenance budget, and presumably were built in les than 45 years by 
the use of additional taxes for this war-mongering world.

Olny has a DB of 2150 RU
If we build a total force of
AF 100
DF 100
jump 100
transport 50
Cost = 25,500 RU (TL D has cheaper attack factors)
Maintenance = 1050 RU (about half the DB)
This force takes 11 years to build based on the DB.

The maintenace cost of 1050 RU (around 5 Trillion cr) is not 
unreasonable if we look at Trillion Credit Squadron economics:
1 x 10^10 people x cr 500 = 5 trillion Credits.  As the Olny space 
fleet would only be around size 160 in my analysis, the fleet can 
actually be based away from home for part of the time (it costs extra 
RU to support units away from base - see PE page 84).

So for a 30/30/100 fleet (cost 11,000 RU = 55 trillion credits) we have 
a maintenace cost of around 5 trillion credits assuming that not all 
ships are based at Olny ... roughly in-line with TCS fleet sizes.


When we look at Olny\'s squadrons in Imperial Squadrons, we see that 
Olny has a trivial 5 squadrons (only 4 as one is a BatRon) ... implying 
that a CruRon costs around 10 trillion Cr and a BatRon aound 20 
trillion credits.  This makes the squadrons much bigger than anything 
in previous publications (Rebellion, Spinward Marches Campaign, 
Fighting Ships, where I calculate that a BatRon is around 1 to 3 
trillion credits and a CruRon is about half this).

One more observation before I move to my conclusions.  Olny has a SBD 
fleet of 1500, which would defeat it\'s own space fleet in 1 combat turn 
and suffer no losses.  You would need around 25 squadrons to take on a 
SDB force of 1500 - I do not know if this was the case in 5th Frontier 
War (I sold my copy 4 years ago), but it makes home worlds in an 
Imperial squadrons game virtually impregnable - you can take out the 
colonies, but the economic powerhouse of the hi-tech hi-pop capital is 
unassailable.


My conclusions
==============
For a war-mongering world (Khuir) SDB and jump fleet are similar in 
size.
For a peaceful world (Olny???) the jump fleet is 5 to 10x weaker than 
the SDB fleet.

I suspect that Imperial Squadrons is based on 5th Frontier War 
algorithms, which is fine for the Imperium in 1100, but far too boring 
for the threatening stance of a pocket Empires campaign.

For an Imperial Squadrons game set using Pocket Empires backdrop I 
would use a different table for determining number of squadrons:
SDB       Squadrons
1500      25
 150       5
  15       1     

or, for those who like equations:
Squadrons = 0.15 x SDB^0.699

This allows me to carry on using 1 BatRon = 2 trillion Cr and 1 CruRon 
= 1 trillion credits (at least for Squadrons from a POP A worlds), 
which always gave me the feeling of large (trillion-credit) fleets 
busily blowing each other up.

When we are talking about this level of money, it is difficult to bring 
out the subtle advantages and disadvantages of a FFS ship design 
(mesons guns vs armour, particle accelerators vs structure, heretical 
spinal lasers against sand casters), so I\'m quite happy for people to 
design their FFS "death star" and put them into trillion credit 
squadrons (60% cost = big ships, 25% = escorts, 15% = auxiliaries like 
hospital ships, missile reloads) and rate them using Imperial 
Squadrons.  Maybe I\'ll let DeathRons cost 4 trillion Cr and give them 
+2 DF, BF = AF = DF compared to BatRons :-)  Just imagine the terror a 
999 J3 DeathRon counter will add to a game.

==========================================

My flatmate thinks I\'m mad, but it was a very pleasant way to spend my 
time.  Here goes:

PE gives a GWP of around 100 to 2000 Cr per person (as only 1 tenth of 
the POP is in the "wealth creation" labour pool) and this is multiplied 
by trade - based on Starport quality and number of trade worlds.  This 
gives a rough spread of 1 to 1200 Cr per person for the annual value of 
trade goods (actually, it is their GWP effect, which may be 
considerably different to the value, but I\'ll ignore that).

Take average trade goods as Cr 8000 per T.

PE: POP A, port A world => 120 million T per week
Rob: POP A, port A, TL A+, Xboat route, GG, 2 parsec => Va=10
Va=10 gives 4 million T per week

PE: POP 8, Port E => 2000 T per week
Rob: 400 T per week

These are both, IMO, close enough for role-playing use, and if I 
increase the value of goods to 16,000 Cr/T I halve the difference.  I 
can easily argue that the GWP of 1 T of goods is 5x the actual value at 
POP 8, 30x at POP A and so on ... it depends on your economic model and 
how you see the relationship between trade and GWP (multipliers or 
dividers, depending on all sorts of issues). 

In short, I think Rob & Jon have come up with a good system to use as 
background for a RPG.

In CT there was the Jump Ship (from Supplement 9: Fighting Ships)
which has a picture of a vessel towing rocks in a  net.  But  the
text talks of Jump Pods of different designs.  The cargo  pod  is
listed as:  "A  bulk  cargo  carrier  displacing  1000  tons  and
carrying approximately 950 tons of cargo.  Several varieties  are
available, including special liquid tankers, bulk food  or  grain
carriers, and compartmented transport containers."

In MT the Rebellion  Sourcebook  gives  us  the  Common  Imperial
Transport which, although has no text, has a picture suggesting a
similar concept.

Regardless of how they are loaded internally, you can almost  see
how a cargo pod operation might  be  run  not  unlike  the  xboat
system.

Also check out the SF comedy film Space Truckers for more ideas.

Actually, they\'ve already got that... there are 3x3x6 meter standardized
containers.  That\'s roughly 10\'x10\'x20\' (about the size of a semi trailer).  It
holds 54 kl about 4 dTons. If you assume a little extra volume for the container
itself, the container will occupy 4 dtons while holding 54 kl.  These modules can
then be loaded onto semis once planetside.  Likewise, they\'re easily stacked for
better storage.  Specialty modules could include micro contragrav lifters,
electronic locks, life support, etc.

Actually, I\'m working on a ship that takes advantage of it.  The primary feature
is the isolated cargo bays.  Each bay is a 15 meter long cylinder that rotates.  A
quarter of the surface is open.  As it rotates, the opening starts as the loading
port.  Then it rolls up into the ceiling, sealing off the cargo bay.  Finally it
opens into an interior corridor of the ship.  Each bay thus operates as its own
airlock and can be isolated from the ship if needed.  Likewise, the bay is just
the right size for a 10 ton launch, making it a handy launch bay. The bay can hold
two of the standardized cargo containers with 2 spare dtons for "loose" cargo.
This isn\'t a very efficient design as far as storage goes, but what it loses in
efficiency, it makes up for in ease of use and safety.

The major consumer of fuel is not the main power plant, it is the jump
drive. A 100 ton ship consumes 140 m^3 of fuel per parsec. That\'s 140000
liters(by your figure for the ratio . Also, did your calcs on mass to
energy take into consideration the fact that 16/20 of the mass of D2O is
the O atom?(Atomic wt O (16) + 2 * Atomic Wt D( 2) I presume that the O
molecules are waste in the Fusion plant (or do we have a really funky
reaction where we get He(D+D), Flourine(O+D) and Sulfur(O+O) as O and D
atoms fuse at random? I know very little about the real dynamics of
fusion.)

Alrighty then, before people accuse me of starting Rob and Jon off on the
huge system that they came up with, first let me point out that I was only
doing the math. My post was in no way a yeah or nay for the figure. 
It all comes back to what level of shipping is your Trav universe at?
Another thing to take into consideration is the
self-sufficiency/specialization of the planet. Rob\'s original figure of
10kg per person per week would not be totally absurd for a planet which
produced next to no food (like a vacuum/dangerous atm mining colony) 
If there was a nearby ag world, you could bet dollars to donuts that there
would be HEAVY freight traffic between the two ( in proportion of course) I
haven\'t done the math on profit margins, but I\'m sure that by just
mentioning it, some one else will. 
On  a side note, two pts which I\'m sure have been discussed before, but
let\'s beat them up again...
1) From what I know of real world space(read rocket) design, the bigger it
is, the more the mass of the engines drops proportionally. This is why
1960\'s NASA relied on mega rockets like the Saturn. Almost everything in
the Traveller design tables follows a linear progression with the exception
of the volume factor of the hull ( maybe a couple others). I\'m sure I\'ll be
bombed with examples of this being wrong, but just look at the fusion plant
tables and the thruster tables. Both are straight progressions (which does
make it easier to make a spreadsheet to do the calcs tho) in every category
except personnel. Questions, Comments?
2) Lemme see.....Oh yeah. How many of you out there place refueling
stations in parsecs without inhabited planets, but with Gasgiants? IMTU,
when such a system is placed along a trade route, a station is orbited
around the GG and ships from the station (which is a modular type and
therefore capable of being moved outsystem piecemeal) dive the atmosphere
to get fuel. They load the station up on fuel and incoming ships merely
have to hook up, not risk their cargo/passengers/skins on an atm dive. I
haven\'t done any design (but feel the urge to do so, look for them in the
next few days) on  a related note, are there any rules for the hazards of
doing a skim?

Why 5G TPlates?  Shouldn\'t 2 or 3G TPlates do the trick, saving a huge
amount of space in your shuttle (smaller power plant) allowing you to carry
several more passengers.  Big cost savings too.

I tried with ClarisWorks 5, using the dataviz translators that came with
MacOS 8 (v9 IIRC) and it hangs about 90% of the way across the progress

When I talked to Rob about the QSDS program he was talking about I found

Apologies for bothering you on the same subject again so quickly, but I
thought this was worth mentioning.

Website News:
- ----
Following a discussion with Rob Prior, the BITS support site for Infini-V
is now the official support site for the program. Why? Because Rob isn\'t
certain if his website will remain there long term.

So if you want to try out Rob\'s superb MacOS software that implements the
Central Supply Catalog\'s Vehicle Design System just point your browser at:

http://www.cybergoths.u-net.com/

and follow the Traveller Page links

News on the PC version:
- ----
We\'re still hoping for an April release of this one. The PC version is
being ported by one of Rob\'s Students, and a substantial amount of the
shareware fee for the full version will be going to him for his university
fees. So, aside from the fact that the Infini-V software is superb, you
will be helping a student fund his way with your shareware fee.

Metator:
- ----
The website above also has the old (no save or print) demo of Metator
installed if you want to try it out (MacOS only at the moment, I\'m afraid).
Metator is Rob\'s World Generation program that produces all manner of
useful information based on the WBH, and the various expanded system rolls
in Traveller.

Also at the Website:
- ----
On the Campaign page are copies of acrobat files which have been generated
to support Traveller (4th Edition).

- - The Combat Crib Sheet amalgamates the rules from EA and T4 on a table
with footnotes (and has T4.1 task difficulties) on a single page.

- - The Introduction to Traveller sheet is a single page file which was
written at EuroGenCon 97 to help explain about the game and its background
to all the people who came up and said "Hi, I\'ve only played Vampire/AD&D.
What\'s Traveller about? How does the level system work...".

Feel free to use either sheet...

- ----
I\'ll stop bothering you all now...

Bear in mind that there is a problem with NE / VE in that it has two
official settings.... the Regency approaching TL17, and RCES struggling to
reach TL12... So which mods do you use (not to mention what about the bits
out of those areas..)

Yeah, isn\'t this in the FAQ yet? I\'ve seen this discussion two or three

informtion from someone working with modern container ships. Check out the

In my universe containers are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 tons. Easier to fill gaps

High-Traffic Surface-Orbit Cargolifter (TL12)

This is the 1000t shuttle modified to carry cargo.  Without
the steward and passenger requirement (and removing the
breakroom), cargo capacity is set at 825 tons.  If desired, 
this cargolifter *may* be able to carry additional cargo modules
for a corresponding decrease in thrust.  If so, then cargo
capacity increases to a max of 2825 tons.

Moderate-Traffic Surface-Orbit Cargolifter (TL12)

This is the 100t shuttle modified to carry cargo, using the
same philosophy as the 1000t shuttle above.  Its carrying 
capacity is 80t.  If desired, this cargolifter *may* be able to 
carry additional cargo modules for a corresponding decrease in 
thrust.  If so, then cargo capacity increases to a max of 280 
tons.


VIP Surface-Orbit Shuttle (TL12)

This is the 100t shuttle modified to carry up to 15 passengers
in staterooms, for those who simply *cannot* travel unless it
is first class all the way.  The ship is modified to carry 5
large staterooms, 10 small staterooms, a lounge, and 20 tons 
of cargo.

Ahh, it ain\'t so bad. By all accounts, Office 98 for the Mac OS is actually
good and Mac-like....

Although it *is* kinda scary -- like invasion of the body snatchers, or a

That would explain all the arcane driver names, incompatibilities, and, of

BTW, did anyone else catch the piece on NPR about astronomers at UC Berkley
postulating anti gravity from new observational data? Do any of the pros on
the list have some more in-depth info about this? On a related note, did
anyone hear about the fusion process discussed on NPR a few weeks back and
it\'s feasability? IIRC, it postulated allowing fusion at much lower temps.

ObTrav: Umm. Let\'s see. I was trying to reverse engineer the length from
volume table the other day from FF&S1 (I am waiting for a second, corrected
printing befor buying FF&S2 -- I don\'t need strange symbols to confuse me
more than I already am). The formula I come up with for the basic spherical
hull is:

(cube root of (volume/4)) X 2

And the formula for surface area I come up with is:

((cube root of volume) squared) X 6

I know I am not a real gearhead, just a poor imitation of one, so I am
quite certain this is incorrect. So please, someone correct me.

someone asks for a gadget I feel the need to communicate its cpabilities on
paper in a non-ambigous fashion (so I can point out the shortcomings later
on).

These devices are, again, not "supertech", only the logical application of
easily postulated technology.

All these devices tend to be illegal, and will be difficult to obtain,
especially without Streetwise skill.

Audio Listening Devices

At TL12, these tiny devices are a self contained transmitter, receiver,
microprocessor and audio pickup.  The receiver is one frequency, and
capable of receiving only simple codes.  The transmitter is a frequency
agile, low power 5 km radio transmitter.  The microprocessor can store
about 1 hour of data and compress it for transmission.  Data is always
kept, oldest to newest, until the buffer is full at which point the oldest
data is overwritten first.

The item is tiny, but not microscopic.  It is manufactured in several
forms, one looks like a stray clothing fiber (in several colors), another a
small wood twig, another comes with several patches made to look like
painted wall and is essentially flat.  All are designed to be hidden in
various places.  Customers are encouraged to specify custom shapes for
their own use.  If discovered, their function is obvious to anyone with
electronics or streetwise.

The bug has several modes, and can be remotely set to change modes.
Frequently, due to the small range of the transmitter, a relay
communications unit is set up outside the "danger zone" where detection is
likely to piick up and retransmit the signal with a higher power and range.

The different modes include;

Delayed Feed; The bug will store audio data (in digital form) and compress
it at about a 100:1 ratio.  After 1/2 the buffer is full the bug will
\'squirt\' the compressed data on a predetermined frequency (different every
time).  A 1/2 hour of data can be transmitted in 90 seconds.  A command
override can signal the processor to hold the data for another 10 minutes
in the event that the frequency is being monitored.  This can be repeated
and even may result in the loss of the oldest data whent he buffer capacity
is reached.

Constant Feed; This mode will feed all audio data in real time as it is
received.  The frequency used will change every ten seconds.  This mode is
not considered very safe from detection.

Intermittent Feed; Data is compressed and transmitted once every 15
seconds.  Transmission time is about .15 seconds.  A different frequency is
used each time a burst is sent.

The signal transmitted is broadcast.  Anyone capable of picking up radio
transmissions over a variety of frequencies will be able to intercept the
signal, if within range.  The compression algorithm is usually not a code
system, just a simple data compression scheme which will take any
reasonable computer no time to decode.  Coding the compression is not
difficult, but requires an extra fee or Electronics-4 and a reasonable
electronics lab.

Audio Bug, Cost Cr. 40,000 for kit with 12 bugs, relay transmitter (50km
range) and compression decoding software. Weight; Bugs: Negligable, Relay
transmitter: 1kg, TL12.

Video/Audio Surveillance Device

At TL12, this device is the size of a golfball, and contains a video pickup
with a "fisheye" lens, an audio pickup, and a receiver/transmitter with
10km range.  The function is identical in many ways to the audio device,
including a buffer size of one hour.  Data is always kept, oldest to
newest, until the buffer is full at which point the oldest data is
overwritten first.  It is important to note that the fisheye lens allows
the video pickup to record events in a hemisphere around the device, but at
the expense of some distortion.  A special decoder is used to \'fix\' the
image for normal viewing.  Software to do this may be added to any
computer, and is sold seperately by the manufacturer.

The three feed modes available for the audio bug are identical in this
device.  Video is high resolution, and a particular area can be "blown up"
to amazing levels if needed.

The device can be made in several configurations.  One is a false
environment controller that will behave as though it were malfunctioning if
anyone tries to use it.  Another example appears to be a standard fire
suppressant outlet that can be attached to the ceiling in most buildings.
A third example appears to be an empty beverage container of the type
dispensed by vending machines all over the Imperium.  The device can also
be placed behind any transparent panel and any distortion or coloration
will be filtered by the software.

Note that in permanent installations this device can be built as part of an
actual functioning device, and signals processed through the other cable
based data systems so that the device is virtually undetectable by any
means short of a detailed visual search.

Teleoperated Surveillance Drone

This complex robotic device carries three seperate video cameras, two audio
pickups; one general and one directional, is self-mobile, and is operated
remotely.  It is quite small (about softball sized, plus legs and
appendages) and is designed to enter buildings from the outside.

Mobility is provided by six legs and a deployable inflated helium
dirigible.  This small dirigible can be \'packed up\' on the back of the
device when not in use,  Two directional fans mounted on either side of the
main body provide a modicum of thrust, but this method of transport is not
very effective in any but the lightest of weather due to the device\'s lack
of weight and power.  When airborne, the dirigible-mode device travels at
about 5 mph/6 kph.

Legs are small robotic legs.  All power is provided by a battery pack, and
if the device can find a standard wall outlet it can draw power from it to
recharge or run its electronics.  Without recharge the battery can last up
to 2 hours if the device is moving around constantly, or up to 5 days if
the device is in its lowest power consumption mode.  In most situations
there is opportunity for the device to "sneak out" of its hiding place in
the middle of the night and recharge at a standard wall outlet.

A small computer is provided which can carry out some simple tasks
independently (like inserting its power probe into a power outlet, or
retracing its steps).  It is not a robot, however, and most tasks must be
performed by a teleoperator in a remote location.  Some tasks can be
programmed in and stored for later activation.

Various sensors may be added to the basic device, but generally it is comes
with one "fisheye" camera of the type described above, and two independent
video cameras with telephoto lenses for tracking specific subjects.  These
cameras are capable of resolving faces at 2km, and printed text at 500
meters.  One audio pickup is similar to the one above, the other is a
deployable parabolic dish which can pick up discrete conversation as much
as 500 meters away in line of sight.  This item can only be deployed when
in dirigible mode or when the device is not moving.  There are also
sensitive vibration sensors on the ends of the front two legs.  These can
(withthe help of the base computer) classify vibration as footsteps or
vehicle sounds, complete with direction and whether they are approaching or
receding, or they can touch the surface of a window and tap the
conversation on the other side (this can also be done with an optional low
power laser).

The front legs also have a \'pincer\', a robotic \'very light arm\' that can
manipulate small latches or fasteners.  The device has little power.  This
means that it cannot \'break\' a lock or latch except by leverage, and door
latches require a bit too much strength, in general, for it to open.

Another common probe present is a computer communications port connector.
Most standard desktop computers have this type of port, and specialized
software for extracting data throught this port from an unprepared computer
is provided.  A lot of data can be stored on a computer and it may take
some time to transmit it al through the relatively narrow bandwidth of the
radio frequncies used, more likely is that the operator will control the
computer, whichhe or she can do as though they were at the keyboard, and
look through the files on the computer to find what they want.

Thanks to its larger size, this device can hold about 4 hours of video and
audio data in its onboard buffer.  Data is always kept, oldest to newest,
until the buffer is full at which point the oldest data is overwritten
first.

Radio communication up to 10km away is by means of a frequency agile low
power radio communicator.  Signals are compressed and coded and frequency
changes every 5-10 seconds randomly.  The device can enter delayed feed and
intermttent feed modes identical to the bugs above, but it obviously cannot
be controlled in this mode, so must be \'in place\' and inactive (except for
data collection of course).

Bug Detector/Jammer

This handheld device will detect radio organized transmissions of any power
or frequency and attempt to jam those transmissions with "white noise" to
prevent signals from leaving the area of one room.

In additon to the radio frequency jamming, the device can generate an audio
\'spoofing noise\' so that a standard audio pickup will not be able to record
the voices of anyone talking quietly within the room.  This will also add
to the vibration of any windows in the room such that those vibrations will
be useless for tapping conversations.

This device will not detect devices which are not transmitting.  It is no
defense against video surveillance.  It will read a room as "clean" in the
presence of non-transmitting listening devices.

Pete

P.S. There needs to be a bit more in the way of spoofing or jamming
equipment.  I can\'t seem to come up with a way to detect something that\'s
just \'listenning\'.  Any ideas?

Well, greatness and SOC are two different things entirely.  There are plenty
of people who have a high SOC here on earth who aren\'t \'great\' or in the
limelight.  Although fame is a part of SOC, it isn\'t the deciding factor.
What SOC is, at least in my campaign, is the network of friends and people you
know, and how powerful they are, and the effects will be different depending
on which career the player chooses.  It also has a bit to do with how one
appears to other people, including etiquette and similar skills.

The higher SOC, the better the chances that one has contacts and people to
help out when the need arises, the lower, the reverse is true.  Low SOC
doesn\'t just focus on little money.  Indeed, the character could be part of a
rich and powerful family, but has decided to throw off her considerable assets
and powerful friends and family to make a name and life for herself (I had an
ex-girlfriend whose father was the CEO of a very powerful company, although
many people who met her would never guess this from her...  well...  SOC
level.  Lived in a tiny apartment in a pretty nice neighborhood, ate take-out
all the time, held a horrible job, hung out with "the wrong people", etc.).  A
low SOC could mean that the person is shy, or obnoxious, and has trouble
moving in certain crowds, or, it could mean that the person is involved with a
large network of people, but ones that are only able to help out in very
limited ways (again, another friend of mine comes from a rich household where
his mother worked her way up from poverty to become a much-sought after
\'industrial\' chemist.  The network of people he knows, however, are basically
people that can do \'very little\' for him from a Trav point of view, squatters,
noise-musicians, etc.)

The level of abstraction that the SOC attribute has at the moment is a good
thing.  It allows considerable freedom for the GM and the players to build a
character around, without chaining them to a stringent set of rules.

With the wide and impressive scale of TLs here on our planet, I think it has
alot to do with industrial infrastructure and availability of raw materials.
For example, in Central and South America the TLs (classic Trav TLs) are
between 4 and 7 or so.  In North America, they stand around 7-9, and that\'s
just one continent.  

South America can get its hands on plenty of \'nudges\' in the right direction
for research, but just doesn\'t have the infrastructure built up for a number
of different reasons.

There\'ll be plenty of worlds in the Imperium that just can\'t get enough steam
to have a high TL, for whatever reason.

If you have something which is just listening and is
electronics-based (as opposed to an optical computer), it emits
electronic noise as it operates.  A very small amount, which would
normally get swamped in background, but it\'s there.

I would expect at a higher tech level than the bug you could construct
a device which emits patterns of sounds and "listens" for electronic
devices which operate in the same pattern (in the same way Tempest, in
theory, pays attention to the electronic emissions of your computer to
tell what you are typing at range).

It might be easier to detect the bug if you already have a sample of
the background without it - if you use your detector on a room, tell
it the room\'s clean, and then someone adds a bug it\'ll find it
sooner.  Or you could make the "sweep the empty room first" version a
tech level lower than the "just find the bugs" version.

As more of the bug becomes optical and less remains electronic, this
technique will be harder.  Anyone know if an optical device has
similar emission characteristics?  Perhaps Mr. Robert Meson would help
us there (ref - non-canon thread where "meson guns" fire particles
which aren\'t what we think of as mesons...).

absolutely. I was perusing Traders and Gunboats the other day and one of
the ship deckplans has \'standard cargo containers\' shown.

However, I suspect there\'d be fewer sizes than you\'re envisioning. Look at
modern containers...there\'s only a few different sizes, but they\'re
designed to stack. I suspect there would be \'container containers\'
preloaded modules containing 1000 or 100 displacement tons, but those will
be for modular cargo ships.

Things that didn\'t fit in these containers would be palletized and
shipped as is.

Can I nominate this for the "best TML .sig/quote of 1998" award?  It\'s
early in the year, I know, but this is great.

Hmm. There is a cover story on USA Today featuring a "Nanny cam" for $400
made by "Eye On You" (http://www.carecamera.com, I think). I wouldn\'t call
the US particularly high law level. There are many circumstances where such
equipment may very legitimately be aquired. Several of my colleagues have
them stuck on their computers. I wouldn\'t consider them that difficult to
obtain, it is just players are more likely to use them for illegal
activities!

>Audio Listening Devices
>The microprocessor can store about 1 hour of data and compress
>it for transmission.  Data is always kept, oldest to newest,
A better method would be for it to use a variety of compression
algorithyms. You know that JPGs are about 10% the size of GIFs which are
about 10% the size of BMPs. That is because BMPs use no compression. GIFs
use "perfect" compression (i.e. you can uncompress it to exactly the same
as the BMP). JPGs use "lossy" compression (ie you can uncompress it to
something almost exactly the same as the BMP). You can set your JPG writer
to go to even smaller files but at increasing rates of lossyness.
So a cleaner design is that the older the data, the lossier the algorithym
is used. You can test this yourself by reading a WAV file into Media Player
in Windows. When you save you have a number of options which reduce the
quality from CD, to tape, to radio, to telephone. And that isn\'t even using
compression (WAVs aren\'t compressed, are they?).
  Also, as audio tends to have a lot of silent bits or repeated background
noise it tends to compress _very_ well.
So, the upshot is, I think you want to revise upward the amount of data
that can be stored and the conditions of it.

>It is manufactured in several forms, one looks like a stray clothing fiber
How about one that is made almost completely of transparent material
of low refractive index? That\'s sort of a catch-all!

>The bug has several modes, and can be remotely set to change modes.
May I suggest a different method of transmission: that it must be pinged to
do an upload. Ie, it doesn\'t broadcast until it receives a signal. The send
signal can be disguised as any number of things from public radio
broadcasts to normal electrical powerline noise. This allows for complete
control of it via the base unit and reduces the chances of it burping at
inopportune moments.
Of course bug detectors can exploit this by blasting off several million
commonly used interrogation codes to see if any respond.

>Coding the compression is not

Coding a transmission is _very_ simple. I wouldn\'t rate it this difficult.
In general, at these tech levels, encryption is just a time-delay, not
foolproof. Bad people with Big Computers will always be able to decript
normal level stuff rather quickly.

>At TL12, this device is the size of a golfball,
The Nanny-Cam is already this size at our tech level. I think we can go
smaller than this at TL12.

Or you can just use Paint Shop Pro if you are stuck on a TL8 planet like
ours
or are too cheap to pay for glam add-ons :-).

>Video is high resolution,
Again, applying the staged compression, if you players have missed a few
data pickups, their images might get progressively blurier. Great plot
device.

>a particular area can be "blown up" to amazing levels if needed.
Outside of the realm of monitoring devices, there are a variety of Image
Analysis strategies that can be employed. One of the most intriguing was
using fractals. A fractal is a repeated pattern. Most objects are made up
of reapeated patterns. Fractal analysis involves taking an image and
working out a set of fractals that would generate it. You don\'t get a
perfect image, but a close match (A commercial system to do this was
developed by Iterated Systems, www.iterated.com, as one of the contended
approaches for HiDef TV. They appear to have some cool demos on their site
but I\'m using a Network Computer to browse with at the moment and can\'t see
them). More interstingly, once you have a picture represented as a set of
equasions you can do wonderful things.
  Like infinate expansion. Any area can be expanded as much as you like. Of
course, if you go far enough, it ends up looking rather like a mandelbrot
set. However it can be good at picking up queues that would otherwise be
lost.
  Another thing is once you identify an object, you can isolate the
equasions representing it, and _remove_ them. The object disapears from the
scene and you just trace the edge equasions to get a view of what is behind
it. Of course, if it completely obscured something it isn\'t going to work
that out, but things like general terrain topography and building edges
will be drawn.
  Similarly, you can use the extension of edge equasion technique to look
past the edge of a picture to see what is there. I think geologicsts are
using this to "project" downward various rock strata to try to predict
various things.

>Teleoperated Surveillance Drone
Cockroaches have very simple biology. This is useful in two senses. One,
you can build an "electronic roach" without much difficulty which will be
just as agile as the normal critter. A great base for carrying around your
bugs. Two, you can attach a small electrical transmitter and wire it into
the roach\'s brain (5th Element?) and control its motion. As roaches are
cheap and disposable, it is a fairly cost effective solution. They aren\'t
as all singing and all dancing as your nifty device, and are subject to
being squashed by rolled up newspapers in places low enough tech to have
them.

>agile frequency
Lets discuss this term. I think what you mean by this is that it can change
what frequency it broadcasts and receives at. In reality this is rather
simplistic and a real system would be rather more complex.
Firstly, it is highly unlikely that anything is going to broadcast
straight. If nothing else a carrier wave of random or innocuous noise (like
electrical equipment hum) will be the main broadcast and the signal will be
encoded into this as fluctuations. Did you read about digital signatures in
GIF picures? Basically a watermark is inserted digially using variations
that are impossibile to detect by eye. This can be used for copy security
or for transmission. You average nudie gif, transmitted all over the know
world in the newsgroup can contain about a page of text. A very nice way to
send hidden messages. Even if someone is looking for such messages, a
simple scrambling algorithym makes it virtually impossible to find.
In the same sense a bug transmitter will encode its signal in whatever
broadcast it sends. Most likely it will monitor its environment to find the
loudest raido noisy object nearby and transmit in the same frequency. The
receiver will just receive all bands at once and look for the encoded
characteristics to work out which one it is broadcasting on. The broadcast
signal can also be spread over a number of different frequencies. If it is
a digital signal, you pump bits 1-4 over one line and 5-8 over another, or
a more random combination changing every few cycles via a pre-determined
flexible algorithym.
Line noise, phone crackle, transformer hum, lightning spikes, etc, are all
random noises occuring in our enviornment that can supply a suitably random
medium to mask a signal. Hell, I even read about one team that was using
the ionisation trails left by meteorites to bounce radio signals off of.

It is really rather a simple matter to choose a complex mathematical
function, apply it to the signal at one end, and apply the inverse at the
other end. There are millions and millions to choose from. As long as the
transmnitter and receiver are in sync you can switch your encoding every
second or two. This makes it very hard to try to decode these.
  Someone trying to foil these is going to be like surfing a breaker.
You\'ve got to grab the signal, follow it up and down the frequency chain,
try to predict where it is going, not get shaken off, all during the short
burst that it transmits on. A rough ride. But role-playable in an abstract
sense, like a jet fighter duel.
  One\'ve you\'ve sussed your enemny. Then you can try to start getting in on
the act and spoofing them by waiting for signals and sending false ones
back.

>Bug Detector/Jammer
>This handheld device will detect radio organized transmissions of any
power
>or frequency
Problem is that any electrical device, from hard disk, to fluorescent
light,  to
clock, generates organised radio tranmissions of a magnitude much higher
than
any bug might.

>jam those transmissions with "white noise"
You don\'t need to know what frequency something is operating at, though, to
jam it. You just scream along all wavelengths. The problem is that you
"white noise" has to be sufficiently complex so that software cannot
distinguish it and screen it out. Since any such complex signal is going to
have to end up being software generated, it becomes a tech-versus-tech
thing (Even if you hook up a brownian motion device, like a nice hot cup of
tea, to your transmitter you will just get natural chaos, which may be even
easier to interpret and filter than computer generated noise).

>to prevent signals from leaving the area of one room.
You can\'t prevent them, you can only try to overwhelm them. But, if they
are built to piggyback on top of other signals, you may just be creating
more of a problem.

>the device can generate an audio \'spoofing noise\'
One problem is that anything good enough to interfere with recording is
also likely to interfere with speaking!

>This device will not detect devices which are not transmitting.
Tech versus tech again. If you bug can detect the bug-detector, it will
just stop tranmitting till the bug detector goes away.

>There needs to be a bit more in the way of spoofing or jamming equipment.
Look at it like this. Mathematically it is impossible to come up with a
compression algorithym that garuntees that you will have a smaller file at
the end than when you start (because if there was, by recursive application
would reduce the size of anything to one bit!). So there are always some
data patterns that will generate a larger file than you started. A spoofer
can try to exploit this by broadcasting a signal (audio is easy, video may
be my means of a flashing light) that makes life really difficult for most
common compression algorithyms. So, your bug is dutifully trying to save
space by compressing its data but, instead of getting smaller, it is
getting bigger! Now, decent software will work this out and store it
uncompressed, but that\'s still going to adsorb its memory (ie cut down the
frame rate). The nice thing is that it doesn\'t even have to be at the same
frequency you are using. Just one that is being recorded. So you can talk
normally, which a either high pitched or low pitched noise warbles in the
background confusing listening devices.
   This isn\'t as good against lossy compression algorithyms, which are
harder to foil this way as they average things anyhow, but at least might
force them to be a bit blurry. Of course, tech versus tech, more advanced
algorithms can deal with wider conditions.
  So paranoid executive wear might be to have some sort of flashy wristband
or collar that sparkles and flashes in bizzard, hard to compress ways. A
collar unit might listen to what was said by the wearer and broadcast an
inversion signal which imperfectly masks it out (can\'t be perfect, the
voice would fade in and out). At the same time it tight-beams a laser spot
to the parallel unit on their companion\'s neck which reinverts the signal
in their filter earpiece and they hear normal, undistorted conversation.
Any monitors, or others in the room, won\'t hear much. (Of course
lip-reading software and a video will reveal all!)
  If you have reasonable holographic projection a distortion field can be
set up to fuzz someone\'s appearance. And, in a similar way, both units can
be in communication via uninterceptable tight beam such that the other\'s
glasses refilter it out.

  The other thing to keep in mind with many of these is tech-blindness.
Sometimes wonderfully high tech gets so self involved that it can be foiled
by simple things. The Janitor might throw away the paper cup you bugged,
the subject might accidentally step on your carpet weevel, the drug dealer
tosses her scarf into a corner on top of your video-cam, or dispite all
your precautions, the maid next store is standing on a chair with her ear
to a glass pressed to the wall.


  Personally, given the many different scientific explanations that we can
see now, and can only guess what the future holds, in my games I just
abandon the specifics and say "you have a TL12 bug" or "you can with your
TL14 scanner". Just leave it as tech-versus-tech.


  The "problem", as most DMs see it, is that if you are expecting to be
listened in on, you can generally prevent it, or make it difficult. However
you can\'t maintain such perfect secrecy all the time. The most useful
espionage is of and when people don\'t expect it. Many adventures focus on
"common people" or non-top of the line types. As an "average member of the
population"
 they are almost never going to have means of ensuring their privacy. They
either aren\'t going to have access to high tech foilers, won\'t have the
money for them, or won\'t perceive a need for them. PCs are almost always
going to be able to find out what they want about them.
  The other side of the coin is that PCs are almost always paranoid
bastards. With access, over the course of a campaign, to many different
worlds of different techs, they are going to gear up to the extent that the
DM has to pull out super-tech baddies, or just use fiat to get around their
defenses.
  This means things end up being heavily biased towards the PCs. But, given
the context, this is normal and expected. They are special types of people.
Adventurers. Over time, as their finances mount, they are unlikely to want
to bother on these sorts of jobs, since they don\'t pay well. It got to the
point in my campaign where the payers just plain weren\'t interested in
anything that paid in anything measured in less than MCrs. That\'s when they
start getting the tough jobs, or else things become political. Favours are
priceless from the right people...

As far as amusing real-world Traveller references, there\'s always the
Travellers Aid Society.  Which I used to work for.  Three years of
depressing, grim, futile social work.  About as far from the Traveller TAS
as you can POSSIBLY IMAGINE.  Though it\'ll be fun to run a Trav campaign
with TAS being a sort of homelessness intervention project for sleazy,

I think you would use this formula :

surface area = (squared(radius * 2))*3.1415926535897926

For approximate volume = (cubed(radius * 2))*0.5236

for volume of a segment of your spherical ship :

segvol=(0.5336((square root of Height of segment)+3*square root of
radius of base of segment)* height of segment)

Already done.

In MegaTraveller Journal #3 on page 28 we find the equipment sheet for
"Cargo Container (sealed)".
Displacement for all is 54kL, with TLs varying from 5 (soft steel) to 12
(superdense), and mass dropping from 11 tonnes to 2.3 tonnes. Cost is Cr
8700.


Quoting from the description section:

"Containerization is  a major revolution in freight handling. Instead of
loading a shipment directly into the hold aof a ship, all goods in a
particular shipment are placed in one or more standard-sized containers.

"Cargo handling becomes much easier, as only a few containers of standard
sizes must be moved, instead of many with widely varying dimensions. This
is particuylarly important at lower tech levels, when cargo handling
robots and equipment are less versatile.

"All tech 10+ units come with an integral control plate. This allows
merchants to enter the containers\' manifest, for easy reference, lock and
unlock the unit, activate and monitor the container\'s security seals, as
well as monitor internal conditions. Access to the containers is usually
restricted by use of card readers or key codes."


An excellent design (says the author, modestly).  Although DGP only
published the 54kL size, I designed many more. Easy to do, using the
design rules.

It is.  The solution may be simple. Allow a world to trade SDB factors for
squadron factors at some standard rate. Thus, a \'peaceful\' world could
keep it\'s SDBs, while a world bent on conquest would manufacture war
fleets instead of defenses.

We just need to set the \'exchange rate\' ...

This actually points up another problem - the frequency of social standing.

If it is indeed the case that the average person is Soc. 7, and that 1
person in 36 is soc. 12, then we have an awful lot of nobility - roughly
the upper 10% of society is running around as knights or better, and the
amount of income they have is pretty minimal.  This does not mesh with the
power these people represent in theory.

Assuming, instead that only player characters have that fraction of the
people at Imperial Knight rank, then things get easier - one person in 36
is merely the top 2.7% of standing and income, and noble ranks are
immeasurably above that.  FWIW, I get that England had on the order of one
person in a hundred anywhere near the noble ranks, which maps to Soc.
10-12, given that many of those people in that top 1% for much of its
history were mere intendants.  Presently, there are on the order of one
person in a thousand or one person in ten thousand, depending on which
almanac you read.

Further, it does not take that much wealth to be spending at the Soc. 15
level, which seems a bit out of whack - every Tom, Dick, and lawyer should
not be at the maximum spending level.  Spending is very, very nonlinear in
the tails in the real world.  A more realistic, but hard to model, system
would work like this:

1. Determine the fraction of society at a given SOC level
2. Determine the average spending of that fraction
3. Make a table in the rules that correspond.  I posted one built off of
last year\'s census figures a year ago, and can likely find it again if
anyone wants it.
4.  Nobles should be pretty far off any scale that includes a normal person.

Point 4 comes as Forbes could only find 300 people in the world with more
than 350 million in net assets, and corresponding returns on their wealth.
This is an easy thousand times the income of the average person, and is
likely similar to the income grades possessed by the average Baron and
above.  Baronets and knights are perhaps a fifth as much.

This is a topic that comes up from time to time around here.  As Joe Pettit
mentioned, cargo containers have shown up in Traveller; one of the earliest
books of ship deckplans (Traders and Gunboats) showed them with the Type R
Sub Trader design.  Those were three-meter wide by three-meter tall by six-
meter long containers holding just under four displacement tons of cargo.
That would make them roughly equivalent to the modern twenty-foot container.

If you\'ve seen my THUDDD entries, you\'ll notice references to six-meter
containers.  A number of us have also proposed a slightly larger five
displacement ton container.  We noticed that mail comes in five-ton lots
and that you *must* set aside five tons for it; the easiest assumption is
that someone loads a sealed five-ton container of mail aboard.  I call
these "seven seventy-sevens" because they\'re 3 x 3 x 7.77 meters, and
assume that they\'re also available for general use, if less common.

The other obvious size, at least in Solomani space, would be an equivalent
to the forty-foot container, a twelve-meter container that would hold just
under eight displacement tons of cargo.

About the same here, but not as much variety. 

  1 ton (2x3x2.33m) 
  2 ton (3x3x3.11m)
  5 ton (5x5x2.8m)

All containers designed to fit into, and through, standard 3.5m deck
heights and cargo hatchs, are stackable and have interlocks for use in
deeper cargo holds. The standard containers have CG float pads,
environmental controls, and are sealable during shipment. 

Larger and irregular cargos are palletized, wrapped in protective sheeting
and shipped as is.  CG float pallets are carried aboard ships for this
purpose.

Ships working on or beyond the frontier often have deal with non-standard
containers and even bagged and loose cargo. Ships carry "knock-down"
container bin components they can assemble to hold non-containerized cargo,
then break down for compact storage. This sort of cargo is often loaded and
unloaded the "old fashioned" way with stevedores and sweat.

But then the missile would need sensors mounted on its nose so that it can
calculate these course changes.  Now were back to square one (ie: the
sensors on the nose are extremely vulnerable to laserfire).

MULTIPLE DOWNPORT RATIONALE

A starport may have up to (say) 5 landing strips; this limits the number
of arrivals per hour.  If ships arrive 6 per hour per strip, then
5 airstrips puts the maximum at 30 shuttles per hour.  If ships
can land every 5 minutes, this number doubles to 60 shuttles per
hour.  Let\'s say, then, the ceiling is 9 shuttles per hour per strip.
5 airstrip starports can accept 45 shuttles per hour.

Large Surface-Orbit Cargolifter (TL12)

This is the 1000t shuttle modified to carry cargo.  Without
the steward and passenger requirement (and removing the
breakroom), cargo capacity is set at 825 tons.  If desired,
this cargolifter *may* be able to carry additional cargo modules
for a corresponding decrease in thrust.  If so, then cargo
capacity increases to a max of 2825 tons.

That\'s a point to consider.

If you *really* want to get specific, then represent classes 1 through 11
as lower and middle and lower-upper classes.  A SOC roll of 2 through 11
maps to classes 2 through 11.  During a career a PC can drop to 1 or 0, but
won\'t begin there.  A roll of 12 allows a 1d6 roll for the upper non-noble
classes 12 through 16 and nobility (beginning at 17).  If the player rolls
a 6 on the second roll, he rolls another 1d6 for his noble rank, 17 through
22.

 2      Lower Lower
 3      Lower
 4-5    Upper Lower
 6-7    Lower Middle

  20     Marquis/Marquise

  22     Duke/Duchess

 Imperial Classes
  23     Archduke/Archduchess
  24     Prince/Princess
  25     Emperor/Empress

The title, Knight would be an honorary rank conferred on an non-noble of
accomplishment and repute.  A non-noble raised to nobility would generally
be for just his/her lifetime and would be called a Baronet. To be a
Baron/Baroness the noble would have to hold an inherited title.

Mr. Meson might have one tool to help us: if Mesons are truly not affected
by normal matter, then they are likely not going to be a great tool to find
such bugs.  If, on the other hand, they are affected, if only in the same
way neutrinos are, then they might make a very nice deep radar or
densitometer.

As far as making such bugs, Traveller does not mention a new technology
beyond holographic, which comes in at TL 13 or so.  Meson storage might be
a good candidate, as circuitry made of it might not even be visible or
detectable until it phase changes the answer into a form we can see.

All machines are going to have some leakage.  Light waves are, after all,
quite small electric and magnetic fields propagating through space.  Good
luck detecting them, but they are there.  More promising, one of the most
common ways to generate the light which is trundling around your equipment
is going to be with accelerated charged particles, and this can usually be
detected by the spillover in other frequencies.

Given that the electronic emissions of standard electricity-run circuitry
is going to be dropping due to the wide use of superconductors, I suspect
these two will eventually reach some kind of minimum, and it feels to me
like that minimum is going to be set more by the physical properties of the
system and the total amount of power being used.

After all, you still need to send the data out some way, and it is probably
easier to detect the strong signal you are trying to send than the weak
signal the apparatus generates.  This will remain true, even if it uses
infrastructure already in place to send the signal, as then you can monitor
your own signal.

As a counter argument to the noise being noticeable, an article in
Scientific American this month pointed out some incredibly tiny lasers
being built.  These little monsters are of the "smaller than a hair" scale,
IIRC.  My oh my, we may see those optical computers sooner than I thought.

Were you aware that we (GDW) were once contacted by the terrestrial Traveler\'s

The phone call came three weeks after we got the papers back for the trademark

First, remember, I am just becoming acquainted with Traveller, so I
don\'t have a terribly complete grasp of all the rules and
regulations.  I would also refer you to my Presumption #9 (above), as
it still holds true. :)

Right, well, the mass given was for bi-deuteriated (or is it di- ?, I
forget . . .) water (D2O), of which 1 mole would mass 20g - 4g of this
is deuterium (2 deuterium atoms per water molecule).  These two
deuterium atoms are the "fuel" for the fusion reaction 2D ->fusion-> 1
He, with a mass deficiency of 0.306 AMU - the mass deficiency is the
amount of matter converted into energy.  When separated by
electrolysis, each mole of bi-deuteriated water would yield 0.5 moles
of O2, and 1 mole of D2.  The mole of D2 would presumably be separated
into 2 moles of free deuterium (just D all by itself).  These 2 moles
of D would then be used in the fusion reaction, and yes, the oxygen is
just a waste produce of the fuel preprocessing and would not be
introduced into the fusion chamber.  The two moles of D ->fusion-> 1
mole He, plus 0.306 AMU (the mass deficiency) x (6.02 x 10^23
particles per mole He) converted to energy.  

Water is a good storage medium for deuterium, as deuterium is
significantly easier to store attached to oxygen (as water, D2O) than
it would be as deuterium gas (D2).  The power requirements for
electrolytically seperating the D from the O would be insignificant
compared to the power output from the fusion reaction.

Now, the mass given, 22.9g per year for a 1000 Mw powerplant at 100%
efficiency - was for water (D2O, the storage medium), not for
deuterium needed (D, the fuel).  The deuterium would account for 20%
(4/20) of this mass, or 4.58g of deuterium per year, at 100%
efficiency.  The efficiency figure of 0.1% was used as an extremely
low efficiency estimate to underscore the fact that fusion powerplants
would not be likely to need refueling very often, even if they were
extremely inefficient in terms of power production (due to containment
field generation, or whatever type of power overhead they may carry).  

Primarily, I had a difficult time with the fuel volume requirements of
the Fusion and Fusion+ powerplants in the Central Supply Catalog. 
Fusion plants (TL12, 2.0 Mw) are listed as needing 0.003 cubic meters
of fuel per 100 hours of operation (or 3 liters) - if this is 0.013
moles of D2 gas or 0.052g - which would yield 0.013 moles of He,
0.0002g converted to energy (I think this is correct, double check) -
which would yield 5000 Mw hours at 100% efficiency.  Efficiency ->
100/5000 x 100 = 0.2% efficiency - or twice as efficient as my
presumption. Were this deuterium stored as bi-deuteriated water
(liquid) instead of as D2 gas, it would need about 0.026 ml of volume,
and mass about 0.26g - so to provide 10 years worth of fuel, you would
need 228g of D2O, and  roughly 228 ml of volume.  Basically, if the
volume listed is for D2 gas, then it is reasonable, but of it is for
bi-deuteriated water (the most likely storage medium), then is is an
unreasonably large volume.

The Fusion+ list the fuel needs as 150 liters of water per 100 hours
for a TL12 4.8 Mw plant.  If this is just normal water, and the
powerplant must separate the deuterium from the normal hydrogen then
this might be reasonable - but my point was that if the deuterium was
built in at the time of powerplant fabrication, refueling would be
unneeded - at least not very often. 

I have not gotten to the jump drive fuel requirements yet, so I can\'t
comment on them.

For the record, I am NOT a nuclear physicist (which is doubtlessly
quite obvious),

One of the things I distictly remember aboutthe early days of Trav was the
abundence of background, but not in the form of Worldbooks or suppliments.
GDW built the Traveller background more by publishing scenarios. By far the
majority of material published was the adventure, or double adventure. Of
course each of these items contained a sizable section that was made up of
background (i.e. Library Data, world discriptions, etc.) but it was wrapped
in an adventure. A lot of the suppliments published for Traveller back then
were compilations of the background data pulled from the adventures.

On the other hand IG seems intent on filling the shelves with suppliments.
Oh, I know they\'ve published adventures, but the majority of their published
works has been in the form of suppliments. While this is a welcomed addition
to the Trav universe, I , for one miss the adventures that were the mainstay
of the CT era.

I\'m not quite as much of a heretic as Eris, but my campaign is enough apart
from mainstream Canon that a lot of the info in the suppliments is only
partially useful. Adventures are ALWAYS usefull, especially when background
is included. You can pick or choose from the background and modify the
adventures to fit your own settings.

Oh, well, enough rambling! I appologise but I\'ve just been sitting here
racking my brain for an idea for tomarrow night and wising I had back all
this LBB adventures that I lost.

Loren, if your out there, please remind SJG that the adventures are as
important as the Worldbooks! It\'d be nice to see some of the GDW style of
"background as background to an adventure" style books published again.

accumulated over the past couple of years - Traveller, Harpoon, Tacops etc. And 
no, I didn\'t have a backup (that\'s why I feel so stupid - do as I say, not do 
as I do)

Anyway, I\'ve got my machine off it\'s back and onto (at least) it\'s knees, and 
I\'m starting to look around to try and find all the stuff that I lost. A couple 
of cases in point:-
1. I know that mpgn.com archives old TML digests, but is there a SEARCHABLE 
archive anywhere?
2. I had a set of sector files in Galactic format, with file names like 
\'asects.***\'. Can\'t find them on the web, does anyone know where I might find 
them again?
3. Beyond Galactic, can anyone recommend a good Sector mapping program? World 
mapping program?
4. I\'ve found Antti Lahtinnen\'s (sp?) starship spreadsheets, are there any 
other good ones around?

That should do for now. Hope there\'s some help out there.

	Depends on the local culture. It\'s nice to know that, according to the last survey I saw, military officers are held in higher esteem in US society than, for example, Congresscritters ... but I bet 30 years ago that wasn\'t true.

Plot hook for a scenario? I am not at liberty to disclose this because it is

Was Dulinor still planning the assassination? Was Dulinor himself

Dulinor even on the gig to begin with? How many angels can dance on the head

Not to be trite, but "that was then, this is now." The world is no longer the
same place it was when Traveller was young and dinosaurs weren\'t confined to
zoos. 
The feeling among marketing types in the game biz is that these days, you
can\'t give adventures away, whereas sourcebooks and world books sell like
hotcakes (well, relatively -- the RPG market is in a doldrums right this
minute). Unless that changes, the current plan is for a "sourcebook with
adventure material included, and encourage adventures in Pyramid" approach.

In the document \'Trav 4.1 Skill List", there is a line that says:

     Record Cluster skills with the cluster parent in parentheses (like
this) in order to note that the other skills within the cluster are
available at one level less.

However, in the document "Trav 4.1 Skill Text", the definition for
Cluster skills clearly states:

     Although the five skills are related (which is why they are
consolidated into a cluster), they are independent. Expertise in a skill
within such a cluster does not give a character any ability in any other
skills under that same heading. Each skill must be learned separately.

In that same document, the Cascade skill concept seems to fit what is
mentioned in the "Trav 4.1 Skill List" document. Which one is right?

My player also mentioned that there is no reference to Energy Weapons
skills, Laser Weapons, etc. What happened to those skills?

Finally, I\'ve noticed a discrepancy between the Brawling task as stated
in the definition for Brawling skill, and the task as stated in the
document "Trav 4.1 Tasks". In the former, the lowest roll wins. The
latter uses the highest roll for the winner. Which is right?

Another thought for a project is something I have started, that is a
Trade & Commerce Utility, works out all those numbing numbers/dice rolls
that usually only need attention during a game session.

I\'m not trying to steal your thunder Rob, but since the subject has been
broached, I would like to know what sort of interest there is in a
Trading utility, or has it already been done.

National Public Radio... sorta like the Beeb, only not.

It\'s one of the American public radio companies; they subsist on grants 
from corporations, interested parties, public contributions, and 
government subsidy.

Actually, Science Friday on Talk of The Nation is pretty good; I wish I 
was on the road  when it\'s on so I can listen to it more often. 

Of course, for hard science fact, it\'s a little light, but it at least 
provides some interesting pointers on things to look out for or go and 
research.

This isn\'t actually particularly true; mass of engines stays linear
with overall vehicle mass. The Saturn was  great honking behemoth
because it had to put a hell of a big payload - a fully-assembled lunar
package - into orbit. There are some scaling laws that favour big
vehicles - surface area to volume, mostly, whcih is already in
the FFS2 system. Granted, you can\'t scale down from a Saturn to a 
12" minirocket, but you can scale pretty well from a Saturn to an
Atlas. (Note that the current fasionable thinking in single-stage-to-orbit
vehicles includes several groups who think small is better.)
Fusion power plants in FFS2 do have some (clunky) scale efficiency
rules. Thrusters don\'t, but they do have a hefty minimum size.

Loren, I know you\'re using the TNS shorts as teasers to hype GURPS
Traveller\'s timeline, that\'s not a slam BTW..it\'s admiration for the use of
a promotional technique that targets the hearts/minds/and expectations of
your core market. These TNS artices are also valuable as adventure nuggets
and background material.  So, I hope that you, or whoever ends up managing
the GT website, archives the TNS articles and keeps them available like a
news database that GM\'s (and players) can access and search for material.

Semi-serious idea...

...wouldn\'t it be a kick to have players in a GT canonical game do a
library search for information...and have it be a *real* library search?
Access the GT website, change to the TNS database, and do a search by
keyword to find why TAS has declared the XYZ system an Amber Zone, the last
known location of Varian, reports of piracy in Fornast, or data on the
natives of Sayat.  

I think something like this might also be marketable on disk or CD,
particularly if you customized the search tool to have player and GM modes.
Heck, you could make the ease of access in player mode dependent on the
players Computer skill...nah that\'s probably going too far. ;->

Of course to make this idea work right somebody would have to enter all the
library data (not just time-consuming, but a copywrite issue), and a *mass*
of past TNS articles. The old library data would be good for a Trav
campaign in any of the standard timelines, but you\'d have to split the file
at the GT/MT break. Of course, if you could, I\'d say put both timelines in
and have three files for the user to search: pre-split CT, the GT branch
and the MT branch.  If you could get the manpower to enter the data (and
it\'s probably already have been done amongst us ;-), I think it would be
worth pursuing the copywrite permission for, at least, the CT data.

The following statement has been issued from Imperium Games
regarding outstanding freelance payments.

Wednesday, February 18, 1998

Dear Freelancers:

I regret to inform you that due to the low performance of Traveller
products in the marketplace, Imperium Games must undergo a reorganization
to address the debts owed to its various vendors. We have attempted to
operate the company with the hope that sales would begin to increase, but,
as this hasn\'t occurred, we must re-evaluate how IG will operate in the
future. 

As part of Imperium\'s restructuring, it has become necessary to discuss
alternative payment arrangements with IG\'s creditors. With specific
reference to our freelancers, we are offering a buyout arrangement of 50%
on the dollar for whatever IG owes for work completed on products which
have been published. Negotiated and agreed payoffs will be paid out over
time as funds are available to IG. We will also allow the freelancers to
retain the rights to the materials prepared by them, provided we may still
sell our backlist products as these revenues will be used to facilitate
the pay-off agreements we make. To this end, we would appreciate your
faxing us information regarding what you are owed, and we will get back to
you to finalize arrangements. You may fax your information to the
attention of Marlene Short at 310-275-9322. 

With regard to work completed on unpublished products which include
#2003 Aliens, #1760-Nobles, #3004-The Vilani Hypothesis, and
#9027-Journal #27, we can only offer 25% on the dollar for work done
on these books, which is 50% of the kill fee for unpublished material.
Of course, individuals may retain the rights to the material they created,
however, 25% is the best we can do in this regard.

We realize and greatly appreciate all of your efforts to help make
Traveller a success. It is unfortunate that the market did not respond
better to the products.

Thanking you in advance,

<signed> Corey Solomon
Imperium Games, Inc.

I read that all the time..about adventures not moving..and I guess it\'s
true, otherwise publishers *would* be publishing adventures. Rhetorically,
is it because gamers won\'t buy adventures, or is it because gamers stopped
buying the adventures the publishers were printing?  Now, gamers *used* to
buy adventure books, at least Traveller gamers used to...so did the gamers
change, or did something about the adventure\'s being printed change?

Oh well, let\'s say the publishers *are* right and there\'s no money in
printing adventure books.  Might it be possible to *electronically* publish
adventures and sell them over the net for $3 or $4?  At that price, I\'d buy
something as well done as one of the old GDW double adventures.  

In 25 to 30 digest sized pages you got an adventure or two, some NPC\'s, a
system writeup, some equipment, a few maps, maybe a deckplan...enough to
fill several game sessions.  You could fit all that into well under a meg
of space, so distributing on disk or by dl should work just fine.

Does anyone think something like this would sell?

Eris,

This is exactly the point I was trying to make in a bit too tipsy a state.
Not only did you receive a healthy dose of background information but an
adventure to boot. With the information just posted in John\'s message a web
based publishing system is a very good option. Something simalar to the
BTRC, 3G3 operation, maybe through a sales house like they use (the name
escapes me at the moment).

3-4 dollars for those type of advenutre/suppliments in an electronic format
sounds about right. Of course I don\'t know about copywrite stuff and
agreements with IG(?) or FFE, but I think they would go.

	1. Military personnel are legitimate military targets, most especially if
they are contributing to the fight.
	2. The presence of a legitimate military target within a protected area
strips the protected status.

HOWEVER! You can\'t use an H-bomb to take out an individual solder. In fact,
it\'s against the Geneva convention to use 50 cal machine guns on personnel.
That\'s why you shoot at equipment, such as belt buckles, canteens, ...

I like this idea!

In combat terms we know that 10 SDB = 1 Attack factor, but cost more 
due to jump drives ... let us use a further factor of two for this.  We 
can either do the conversion based on CruRon Attack factors, or just 
use a standard conversion for any world:

CruRon basis
============
1 squadron = (P-2+M) x 10 SDB\'s


"Standard" conversion
=====================
1 squadron = 70 SDB\'s

So, going back to the example of Olny, it could trade in 1440 of its 
1500 SDB\'s to "buy" 16 more squadrons (90 SDB per Sq) - a total of 
80 extra AF (if CruRons) or 56 AF (if BatRons) ... which is around half 
the "combat strength" the SDB force represented.  This seems about 
right to me.

Now Olny has 21 squadrons, rather than 5, which is within spitting 
distance of the 25 Sq I wanted to give to a war-mongering pocket empire 
like Olny.  Excellent!

I used this principle to design a rather large open structure ship that would
carry 4 large cargo pods.  The pods were medium boxes that fit into 4 large holes
in the ships open structure (see figure below x is the ship structure around the
pods, p is the pod).

The pods were exposed on top an bottom, and were about 80 tons or so.  I designed
a range of pods - cargo, weapons, troop transport, science labs, etc.  I was
thinking of Semi-Tractor Trailers (18 wheelers) and how (at least in the movies)
the military and the government can put a science lab or whatever, wherever they
need it.

Each of the pods was self-contained with its own life support, airlock, etc. They
were basically box-hull ships without jump drives or engines.  I also designed a
ship to take these pods from orbit to ground.

For the life of me I can\'t find the stats on them, but I might redesign them one
day (yeah, right).

Does this mean that we can look forward to the (I\'m sure) excellent work of
many of you freelance contributors anytime soon??  Please, please.

Or will there be an attempt to publish such works commercially in a different
manner (assuming that one can be created without infringing any trademark
rights of Marc or IG) - doh!  Just check the T4 Book1, FarFutures Enterprises
only licensed the Trademark.  He didn\'t transfer it.  Excellent move, Marc!
(And I\'m saying that a law student who has studied trademark and know how easy
it is to lose your rights).

I hope this doesn\'t hurt the progress of T4.1

As much as I would like something like to work, I just don\'t think it will.
They\'d have to be *top* quality.  Maybe that easier with Traveller stuff, due
to its traditional high quality benchmarks, but I\'m still going to want to
thumb through the pages, so web publishing would have to have that "show me
first" kind of appeal.

I think one reason that adventures for many RPGs don\'t sell so well is that,
generally, IMHO, they aren\'t worth a whole lot.  I think, without any basis in
knowledge or fact, that the RPG market as a whole has aged a bit.  You get
gamers fully capable of  creating their own adventures and their own
campaigns.  (Some of the best gaming sessions I was ever in were led by a
referee that made everything up on the spot.  Amazing guy, absolutely no
preparation. And it wasn\'t even Silly Era type adventuring, well, only
once.).   And many, at least among those I know, who would rather make their
own campaigns with a standard set of rules.  YMMV.

OTOH, web publishing an adventure may be an excellent way to keep interest in
the game as well as provide more and higher quality images, plans and the
like.  (Before I forget, Marc is probably going to have to give them the FFE
stamp of approval - which may be an excellent way to further maintain the
quality).

Blah, blah, I said,  . . . My Point:

Such a scheme needs a market test.  We need a developed adventure to put on the
web.  It should be free (just the first one).  FFE would need to give it the
stamp of approval.  And it should attempt to get some feedback from those who
use it (especially, would you pay US$3-4 for similar products of this
quality).  Such a test will tell right away if theres enough of a market to
support web publishing of adventures.

I\'d be willing to help, but I\'m probably best put to use as an editor than a
content creator.

What\'s the stuff that glows in those stick-on glow-in-the-dark stars?

Can anyone tell me why glow-in-the-dark materials - the kind that absorb
energy from bright light and then emit for several hours - are seemingly
available only in a pale greenish-white color? Why not other colors? 

(I know that there are pigments which fluoresce under UV light, but they
stop when the UV light is turned off. I\'m not talking about
chemofluorescents either, like in glow-sticks.)

Is there any reason why a future technology might not be able to produce a
wide range of glow-in-the-dark colors, and ones more intense and saturated
than the greenish-white stuff?

Hoping the collective wisdom of the TML can help out,

Actually you\'re pretty darn smart Marc, posting things to the list

nearly anything that\'s amiss in a document.  :)

Perhaps the easiest and fastest way to do this would be to webbify one of the old

I believe that glow in the dark paint is based in an element known as
"radium" which is mildly radioactive, hence the "glow" in the dark
effect.  If one were to paint one\'s house with such paint, I would
venture to say one would soon become sick from the radiation exposure. 
I am not sure and cannot quantify this.

I hope so.  It\'d be highly unorthodox, possibly diabolical in nature, but
fun.  I used to have lots of fun with glow-in-the-dark paint.  Great for
personal decoration too (put it on your 4" nose tusk, lips, fingernails and
eyebrows -- guaranteed to liven up any party once the lights go out).

Lest anyone think the march of progress has halted, we\'ve moved way beyond
the raw essence of interstellar civilization and entered into the
pulsating, throbbing richness of it:  another starship, two solar systems,
a writeup of their "homeworld" in WBH format, two nonhuman sapient species
affiliated with the Concourse, a new section for articles on the language
(currently holding an outdated trial translation of a 20th century Russian
Acmeist poem into Sayat, and the fairly final draft of Sayat phonology; I\'m
having tons of fun thinking of terrible double-entendres in describing
Sayat linguistic structures), and -- vital to any civilization -- a page of
windy, introspective self-justificatory b.s.!

Stay tuned for new vehicle designs (the "low-profile scientific specimen
acquisition platform" is due first, then a mobile home.  Yes, of _course_
the backwoods Sayat live in trailer parks!  Like, duh!!!), at least the
Galanglic portion of a Sayat tourist phrasebook ("Our room is too quiet;
don\'t you have anything noisier?"  "So, there really hasn\'t been any sort
of intellectual life on your planet since the Vilani left, has there?"),
another starship (hee hee hee), a fuller writeup on the ecology of their
homeworld, and details on the Sayat tongue as they become printable
(inversion! antipassivization!   cleft stacking! labial spreading!
participant binding! clitic pushing! hard movement!)... and more.  Like
shots of the Sayat Barbie, if I can get decent photos of hir.

Before I\'m forced to start up a PBEM with Sayat content (PCs are an
uncomfortable alliance of Concourse and K\'kree militarists, united only by
their fear and hatred of mysterious, malicious, neighboring high-tech Fungi
From Yuggoth/flesheating sky-monsters/Droyne), I\'ll have to just publish a
goddamn Compendium of the Sayat Concourse (CSC -- whoops, that\'s already
been used.  No can do.  Whew. I\'m off the hook.)

And like here on Earth, even in the "low tech" areas, you if you have
the money, you can get almost any high tech you want. 

Consider how many third world countries have some "showpiece" high tech
facility. And how many dictators tax their people to the limit to pay
for higher tech for their military (and secret police!).

That last is important. I can *easily* see a repressive lo tech world
where the local secret police (a function that is known to go back to
*at least* Roman times!) are using some pretty advanced technology to
keep an eye on the people.

Players might think the renaisance level locals are funny. Until they
get dragged up before the local inquisitor and he starts playing
holographic recordings of their "secret" meeting. Sure, that sort of
tech is "illegal" for the common people so as to protection them from
the devil\'s touch of this unholy technology. But (naturally) the
inquistors are "good" enough to resist the tempations involved. (Yeah,
and I have this swampland on Regina for sale)

But it *doesn\'t* need them. The missile "knows" where it is (good
inertial tracking system) and you are telling it (with some lag)
*where* the target is, and even where you saw it as being a while back.
For a typical guidance computer that ought to be more than adequate info.
