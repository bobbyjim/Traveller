  In my experiments with Traveller, I have also tried changing the 
  tech level with different mods for government than those 
  published by GDW.  The table I eventually settled on is as 
  follows:

              F                 -4

  Note: For balkanized worlds, generate the national governments of 
  interest, and use <my other table, which factors in espionage> to 
  generate gov\'t TL modifier.  (see Note to Note)

  Note to Note:  The other table mentioned here is essentially 
  identical, except that because of intelligence-gathering 
  activities, negative DMs are moved one notch closer to 0 (i.e. a 
  -1 becomes a 0, -2 becomes -1, and so on.)

  Rationale:  +0 modifiers - When there is no formal government
                 structure, any new technology developed is
                 unprotected, save by individual effort.  In this
                 event, even if the technology is developed, it
                 will be slow to be released, because of concerns
                 of the developer profiting from it (i.e. the
                 developer wants to; others may be more willing to
                 steal the technology than buy it).

                 In a benign oligarchy, or a charismatic 
                 dictatorship, it is less likely that those in 
                 power will hear about good ideas that are not 
                 developed within the governmental structure, thus 
                 reducing the chance of advancement.  Such a 
                 government, however, will not necessarily _reject_ 
                 an idea if it hears about it.

               + modifiers - A company has the utmost interest in 
                 development of technology that will allow them to 
                 achieve higher return on investment.  Ideas will 
                 be actively sought after, and explored for their 
                 profit-making potential.

                 Democracies have a high level of personal freedom 
                 and will tend to allow ideas to percolate around 
                 without interference.  Coupled with laws 
                 protecting intellectual property, and the fact 
                 that the government will generally be pretty busy 
                 trying to prostitute itself to the special 
                 interests acting in the name of "the people," 
                 there will probably be significant opportunity for 
                 ideas to be pursued despite theoretical 
                 restrictions on the use of government funds.  The 
                 less a government has to deal directly with the 
                 people, the more it will be able to direct 
                 research, thus the lower DM for a rep. democracy 
                 vs. a parcip. democracy.

               - modifiers - The fundamental obstacles to 
                 technological progress in these governments are 
                 multiple: insularity from people outside the 
                 government, doctrinaire educational policies, 
                 rewarding of conformity over individual 
                 initiative, personal paranoia (in the case of 
                 dictatorships), conservatism (including but not 
                 limited to religious orthodoxy and extremism)...  
                 All of these combine, to varying degrees, and 
                 result in an inability to develop ideas once they 
                 are presented, and a further reluctance for 
                 individuals to present their ideas for fear of 
                 being condemned or persecuted for them (recall 
                 Nazi Germany\'s attitude towards "Jewish Physics").

  Note that these are only guidelines; fiddle with them to suit 
  your needs.  Some of the factors cited for negative DMs might be 
  at work in governments that have positive DMs, and vice-versa.

Re: Life Stat

Two nights ago, Wildstar proposed adding a life stat to the UWP in order
to account for the extent of a planet\'s ecosystem (presumably to be
modified by colonization whether destructive or beneficial). However,
he suggested rolling under the stat on 2d6 to determine whether or not
native sentience has evolved. Mark Watson argued that this is probably
too liberal, and being conservative on this issue (my reasoning can be
read in yesterday\'s TML), I\'m offering the following table for criticisms.

0: Sterile
1: Amino Acids
2: Single-celled organisms
3: Multi-cellular bacteria
4: Simple vegetation
5: Complex vegetation
6: Microscopic insects & sea life
7: Macroscopic insects
8: Macroscopic sea life
9: Land/Air-based herbivores
A: Land/Air-based predators
B: Large/Complex predators
C: Tool use
D: Fire use
E: Agriculture
F: Symbology (full sentience, TL=0)

As you can see, my peculiar prejudice for cracking down hard on the
"minor" races has led me to confine even the most advanced of them
to TL=0. For my own campaign, this is perfect, but I imagine that for
most others, it won\'t do (just another example of how setting drives
planetary generation and vice-versa). For the more liberal-minded,
you may want to give C+ various higher degrees of technology than
what has been listed.

Re: Resources Stat

Wildstar also proposed a "resources" stat. Here is another table for
your consideration.

0: Barren
1-4: Poor
5-8: Moderate
9-C: Rich
D+ : Extreme

Poor: Basic chemical diversity necessary to support indigenous life.
   Otherwise, no claim to fame.
Moderate: One solid natural-resource industry. Roll on table 10a of
   the MT Ref\'s Manual. Re-roll 34-54 if life < 4 (see above). Re-roll
   65 if life < 5. Re-roll 55-56 if life < 8. Re-roll 61-64 if life < 9.
   Re-roll 66 if life < A.
Rich: Two natural-resources industries, one of which commands strong
   subsector-wide influence.
Extreme: Three natural-resource industries, one of which commands
   sector-wide influence.

Note: The GM should translate natural-resource industries into their
   manufacturing/processing (2nd stage) industries as seems appropriate.
   See MT Ref\'s Manual (pg52) for possibilities.

Another note: Under this system, the resource stat is rolled before
the life stat, and the life stat is rolled before the specific
industries are determined.

I admit, this is all very cut & dry, but it\'s easier to complicate
a simple system than to simplify a complex one.

I have another question about atmosphere type E. It assumes that
the world is ellipsoidal (egg-shaped?), and that therefore the
atmosphere pressures range from very high to very low depending
on where you are on the planet\'s surface (since the atmosphere is
still spherical) (see page 21 of ref\'s manual). 

Two questions: Is this realistic? Would is also apply to the
hydrosphere? (if so, we could have a world mostly submerged but
with two ends jutting like mammoth mountains out of the water,
seems strange to me).

The "Ice-Capped" trade classification means that most or all of a
planet\'s water is locked up in ice caps.  Thus the requirements are an
atmosphere that (in general) won\'t support liquid water, but with a
non-zero hydrographics code.

There are lots of TL-5 to TL-8 Industrial worlds in the Imperium; the
benefits of robotics and fusion reactors are not going to be felt here.
On a more general theme, power generation is not the only kind of
industrial pollutant; most chemical and manufacturing processes have
nasty by-products.  Although this is only one data point, most
industrial nations here on Earth currently have a problem with the
pollution of the environment with industrial wastes.

I can\'t really believe in entirely mechanised shipyards, nor can I
support the idea of a world populated by a couple of thousand humans and
several million robots all turning out goods at an enormous rate.  If
one assumes that interstellar trade is a fraction of the Imperial
economy, then the most important factor in setting up an industrial
world is the presence of a strong local market.  Which will require
millions of consumers, hence the population requirement.

No, a Rich world is one that is prosperous because it has reasonable
living conditions, is not over- or under- populated, and has a
government which is conducive to personal prosperity.  If a corporation
should take over a Rich world, it will cease being Rich, because the
corporate government would change the way the worlds\' inhabitants live
and work.

Since all of the other UWP stats reflect the condition of the world as
it is now, and changes are inferred; I\'d assume that the changes due to
colonization have already been applied (just like the effects of any
terraforming have already been applied).  Given this, and given that
upon reflection even I think that rolling 2d6 for Life or less is
probably too liberal, try the following:

Life Score
0 = Sterile (although "organic" compounds may be present).
1 = Pre-Life (sophisticated "organic" compounds, precursors to life).
2+  Some Life Present (at least single-"cell" simple organisms).
    As the Life score increases, the number and size of the ecosystems
    increase, as does the number and complexity of the organisms which
    can be found there.  Remember that this applies equally to 
    native life-forms as well as "imported" forms (due to activity of
    the Ancients, colonization, or simply by accident).  The minimums
    for native development of a given complexity can be figured out from
    the table below.

Whether or not you apply DMs to the Life score based on the stellar zone
the planet is in (inner, habitable, or outer) depends on your views on
really outrageous biochemistries.  If you believe that sentient life can
evolve in ecospheres in gas giants or on ultra-cold (or ultra-hot)
worlds, the zone DMs should be no more than -2 or -4.  In this case, I\'d
suggest using a -3 for Inner and Outer Zone worlds, and a DM of 0 for
worlds in the habitable zone.  This is probably compatible with the
Classic Traveller vision of the universe (which is heavily indebted to
Larry Niven and Edward E ("Doc") Smith) with intelligent gas-giant
dwellers and all sorts of exotic life-forms, and sentient life-forms are
all over the place, although many of them (from the Jgd to the Cymbiots
aren\'t really "life as we know it").

While the above pretty accurately describes the way I feel, I certainly
understand if this isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea.  For a lot less life in
general, and a lot less intelligent life, try the following DMs:
- -1 if not a Main Sequence (size V) star
- -1 if not a Spectral Class F or G star
- -6 if in Inner Zone
- -4 if in Outer Zone
This should cause the most Life to cluster around the habitable zone of
class F and G Main Sequence stars (in other words, stars like the Sun or
a little brighter).  Thus most life will be "life as we know it", and
will be much less prevalent than in the first method.

Now throw 2d6 and subtract the results from the Life Score:
0-  No significant native organisms (all "boring" or imported).
1 = "Interesting" native single-cell organisms.
2 = "Interesting" native microscopic (multi-cell) organisms.
3 = "Interesting" native plants (macroscopic).
4 = "Interesting" native animals (non-sentient).
5 = Complex native ecosystem (multiple "Interesting" organisms).
6+  Native Sentient or near-Sentient life (always interesting).

The second throw should probably be part of the "world building"
procedure, and not part of the basic generation.  Once the throw is
made, the referee will then have to decide (as part of the detailed
world description) what the "interesting" things about the planet are.

>From the above procedure, you .4% for all worlds (or a little less than one
in 18) with native sentient or near-sentient life.

> [table omitted in the interest of brevity]

I really wouldn\'t want to lock down that exactly what each level on the
scale means.  Comparing two ecosystems on Earth is rough enough;
extending this to encompass, for example, silicon based
methane-breathers will stretch it too far.  Not every world is going to
have a carbon and water based metabolism that arose from the oceans.

I really don\'t agree with this, particularly from C (Tool Use) on up;
these distinctions should really be made as part of the details for the
native sentient or semi-sentient race.  The exact stage of development
should probably be determined by the referee during the "world building"
stage of generating planetary details.  I should also point out that
while the use of tools and fire is pretty much a clincher for sentient
or semi-sentient creatures, by the time they are practicing agriculture
the society is pretty much at TL-0.

Using the tables above as a guide, the followings are minimums for
native life forms:

0 = Sterile
1 = Pre-Life
2 = Life (maybe even pre-cellular life)
3 = Single-Celled organisms
4 = Multi-cellular organisms
5 = "Plant" life
6 = Animal life
7 = Complex ecosystems
8 = MINIMUM for native sentient organisms.

But please note that it is possible for a world to have a Life score of
12, but not have any "interesting" native life.  One possibility is a
world that has been colonized, and the colonist\'s imported plants and
animals have out-competed the native ecosystem, which as become nearly
extinct.  This is a definite possibility, particularly on worlds that
have been civilized for thousands of years.  Another possibility is a
world that is covered with oceans, which are literally filled with an
amazing diversity of single-celled organisms.  Literally every square
centimeter of the worlds\' surface has something living on it.  Although
such a world might have a relatively high Life rating, it may only rate
as having "interesting" single-celled organisms.

> For the more liberal-minded,
> you may want to give C+ various higher degrees of technology than

I would think that it is better to have the Life score as independent of
the natives\' TL as possible.  The Life score can be used to determine
whether or not there *are* natives, but their TL is more properly the
province of the worlds\' TL score.  If the world hastion only
4-7 Major Source; important subsector-wide producer
8+  Principal Source; important sector-wide producer
The referee will then have to decide what commodity (or commodities) the
world\'s resources represent.  While this is relatively quick and dirty,
there are some potential problems.  These problems are the same as the
ones inherent in the scheme proposed by Jim: it is quite possible to
roll up two worlds, both major producers or better, and both with the
same resource, all in the same subsector.

Either Jim\'s method, or the method above (I don\'t think it\'s very
important either way; the two are nearly equivalent) are probably
suitable for most referees.  On re-consideration, Jim\'s system is
simpler, and therefore probably the better of the two.

A better method would be to select a resource type (perhaps using Table
10a, or from some other source), and roll 1d6.  This is the "amount" of
this resource, but not more than the resource score of the world.
Continue until the entire resource score is accounted for.  An example
is in order:

2d6 Roll 10 for the Resource score of the world.
1st Resource: #61, Livestock.  Amount: 5
2nd Resource: #42, Plants (wood).  Amount: 4
3rd Resource: #63, Livestock.  Amount: 1 (a 3 was rolled).

So, our hypothetical world produces Livestock at Level 6 (the two
livestock resources add, at the referees\' discretion), and Plants (wood)
at Level 4.

Comparing all of the scores and types within the subsector and within
the sector will reveal the primary producers of each type.

Agreed.  While I don\'t like your Life system, the resource system you
present is very simple and has the desired effect.  One suggestion,
though: prehaps we should come up with a resource type table which is
more appropriate than good \'ol Table 10a/b.  A better variety of
resources, and with the table organised so that we can use a DM based on
Life, Size and/or other planetary stats would be good.

One possibility would be to use a 1d6+1d6 table (like tables 10a) and
apply DMs to the first die based on the Life Score (Life 0=-2, 1-3=-1,
4-6=0, 7-9=+1, 10+=+2) and the second die based on the world size (Size
Asteroid/VerySmall/Small=-1, Large=+1).  What do y\'all think?

Since your center of gravity is going to be roughly at the center
of all three axes of the ellipsoid, yes, you will probably have
lower pressure at the ends of the ellipse than at the equator (I\'m
assuming that the planet is elongated from pole to pole; anyone 
who knows more about planetary evolution want to confirm or deny
that that\'s the most likely situation?). Just how significant
those differences would be would depend on the size of the planet.
And, yes, it would affect the hydrosphere, too. There probably
wouldn\'t be a whole lot in the way of equatorial landmasses.

If you\'re not adverse to going beyond the original six stats, there are
some additional variables which would be extremely useful to have.  As a
quick background, we have the three physical stats of the world, which
describe it in terms of:

Size (independent)
Atmosphere (dependent on size)
Hydroshpere (dependenty on size and atmosphere)

It would be nice to have two additional stats to use in later generation
of the world\'s characteristics:

Resources (independent) - an indicator of the available natural
  resources on the world.  A high value indicates extensive,
  high-quality, and/or readily exploitable resources (mineral, fossil, 
  vegetable, or animal - this is non-specific, except that it indicates
  the presence or abscence of resources which otherwise aren\'t shown
  in the UWP).  Throw 2d6-2 for Resources; DMs subject to Referee whim
  (for example, the Spinward Marches is known to be deficient in heavy
  elements; perhaps a DM of -1 to the whole Marches to reflect this?).
  Restrict the result to the range 0-F.

Life (dependent on atmosphere and hydrosphere) - A general index to the
  prevalance and variety of life on the world.  A low score would
  indicate a barren world (your average asteroid or iceball "there isn\'t
  enough life on this ice-cube to fill a space freighter!") while high
  numbers indicate a thriving and diverse biosystem ("There\'s something
  down there; massive life readings!").  Throw 2d6-2; DM-8 for Vacuum 
  Trace, or Insidious, -6 for Very Thin or Corrosive, -4 for Exotic, 
  -2 for Dense/High, Ellipsoid, or Thin/Low, No DM for Thin Tainted,
  Standard Tainted, or Dense Tainted, and +2 for Thin, Standard, or
  Dense.  Apply a Hydroshpere DM: -4 if 0, -2 if 1, No DM if 2 through
  5, +1 if 6-9, -1 if A.  Other DMs can be used too: a +1 for worlds 
  within the Ancients, First Imperium, or Rule of Man (old colonies or
  terraforming efforts).  If Stellar Types are being used, an additional
  DM for the suitability of the star might not be a bad idea.  Restrict
  to the range 0-F.

[Extra credit if you can identify the quotes]

The resources score can be used to justify settlements on otherwise
inhospitable worlds, and should server as a positive DM for population.
The ratinale is that there is *some* type of valuable resource present
(which doesn\'t otherwise show on the UWP), and therefore it is likeley
that someone has come (despite the hardship) to exploit it.

The Life score can be used to get a "feel" for the native biosphere, and
to gauge whether or not there is a native race to consider (throw Life
or less on 2d6 for a native sentient or semi-sentient race?).

For figuring out a world in the context of a long-standing interstellar
community, you can use Resources to represent the attractiveness of the
world to the "outside" starfaring cultures, while the Life score can be
used as a basis for determing if there is a "native" culture to interact
with.

> Pixie/Regina  A100103-D        Paya/Aramis  A655241-9

In the case of Pixie (I\'ve had to deal with this one, I have run quite a
few campaigns out of the Regina subsector), I\'ve taken the approach that
the world is essentually all naval base.  The only personnel ther (with
a handful of exceptions) are Navy personnel, their dependents, and
civillian contractors.  The shipyard facilities are all run by
transients ---- the entire population of the world is transient (and
therefore, there were0only a handful of "inharitants" when the world was
surveyed).  There are tens of thousands of people there, almost all of
whom will be gone in dwo to four years (to be replaces with a new
batch).  The civillian contractors there run shipyards, and aren\'t
adverse do doing work on non-navy contracts utilizing spare capacity
(thus the Class A rating).

I\'d say that the original system (which presumably generated both of
these) was prone to such problems.  Worlds like these *could* occurr,
but should be *much* more rare than the original system provides.  If I
had a choice, I\'d use your modified system and hand-modify the worlds
that I specifally wanted to be anomalous, rather than use the original
system and have to check each world for reasonableness.

  For a bare-bones set of mods, use the following:

  No Law or Moderate Law        +0
  Low Law                       +1
  High Law                      -1
  Extreme Law (A-C)             -2
  Extreme Law (D-E)             -3
  Extreme Law (F-G)             -4
  Extreme Law (H+)              -5

  Rationale:  At No Law, there is no way of ensuring that the 
  person who develops new technology will be able to profit from 
  it.  If something is good, it will be used by anyone who can get 
  their hands on it, and without paying.  This reduces the 
  incentive.  

  At Low Law, there may be some protection, so there will be some 
  innovation.  However, it only rates a +1 because the government 
  will normally not be powerful or influential enough to make large 
  investments in research.

  At Moderate Law, you will typically have a government that has 
  the power, influence, and revenue to invest in research, and 
  sufficient freedom of information exchange to make it profitable 
  (in terms of results).  However, at this stage, the government 
  will probably have a tendency to want to direct the research, 
  rather than dropping the cash on the table, sitting back, and 
  saying, "O.K.  folks, let\'s see what you can come up with."  

  This directive tendency will continue at higher law levels, and 
  with the continuing decrease in personal freedom and freedom of 
  information exchange, and increasing compartmentalization of 
  research, the return on investment will typically drop heavily.  
  At some point, the government will probably decide that research 
  is unproductive of results, and tech will stagnate (Look at the 
  USSR on Terra in -2531 - most of their technology was acquired 
  through intelligence gathering).

  These worked pretty well for me.  I\'ve also tried fooling with 
  the DMs for government type, with results that were not 
  unreasonable.  That info is posted in my next message.

For an excellent treatment of this question, look into ``Cyteen\'\', by
C.  J. Cherryh. It\'s one of her Union/Alliance novels. Here the limiting
factor is real live parenting - the clones (``azi\'\' in the book, which I
assume is a contraction of ``azygotic\'\', a zygote being the technical name
for the fusion of sperm and ovum before it starts dividing) are brought up
on ``tape\'\' (some form of learning and psychological conditioning in their
sleep), because real people choose not to take the time to be with the
child azi 24 hours a day. Thus they grow up rather insecure (generally
psychologically addicted to tape) and very focussed. There are definitely
shades of ``Brave New World\'\' in there too.

Also, it should be mentioned that the article in the Economist on solar
sailing was one of their leaders, which are somewhat whimsical at times.
The serious article in the Science and Technology section about solar
sailing was pretty good, though.

  Why exclude law level from the tech modifier?  The more
  oppressive a society is, the less likely it is that the geniuses
  will appear and create the new technology.  Earth history bears
  this view out; the cultures that made the largest advances in
  technology were the ones with high levels of personal freedom.
  Certainly, other, less free cultures may do a better job of
  exploiting some forms of technology, but they\'ll probably get it
  from a culture that is more free.  I\'d hardly expect a totally
  oppressive theocracy to be innovative...

First, I want to thank everybody for helping me out on that
allegiance code question. I guess I must have slept through the
5th frontier war or something.

Anyway, I\'m continuing to mull over the sunbane data on the
spinward marches despite my limited knowledge concerning the
region\'s recent history, and (at the risk of getting into a
really long discussion) I have to admit that I keep thinking the
same thing over and over: "There\'s something wrong here." What
I\'m talking about is UWP\'s (formerly UPP\'s) which don\'t make a
whole lot of sense to me. Sonthert/Lanth is a decent example of
what I mean.

Here we have a couple million folks making a living with their
19th century technology, and look what they have to breathe: a
very thin (and tainted) atmosphere. For all intents and purposes,
a vacuum. I know... I know... they can get by with combination
respirators/filtermasks, right? All couple million of them? With
technology which is over a century old? I can just see it now.
"Don\'t go outside, son. Yer might have to breathe or somethin\'."
Hey, at least TAS had the sense to classify it as a red zone
(don\'t go there if you\'re addicted to oxygen).

Okay, all kidding aside, the thing that gets me about planets
like this is that anybody decided to colonize them in the first
place. Agreed, with a bit of technology, people can survive just
about anywhere they want to survive, but why bother? I see a nice
dirtball only five parsecs trailing.

Now this is sweet. We\'re talking primo-atmosphere (none of that
chewable Los Angeles gunk). And lo and behold, who shows up to
catch the view? A whopping seventy people. We have more folks on
the TML than this. Yes... I know... the planet is corporate
owned, but who really cares? Why waste a virtual paradise (at
least compared to that other place) on seventy stinking corporate
losers (or maybe corporate winners in this case). Ah, yes... I
can see some cool scenarios... the corporate paradise. The wooing
ground for potential investors. Perhaps it\'s just one big golf
course. You tee-off from orbit.

But the fact is, this would never happen. When the place gets
colonized way back when, people are gonna zoom in on this little
speck of rock like nothing you\'ve ever seen, and any corporation
that wants it is gonna have to pay through the nose (and a few
other choice orifices) to get it.

My point: this situation shouldn\'t happen. It goes not only
against intuition and common sense, it goes against the principle
of greed, the fundamental root of human nature (yes, I\'m down on
humanity, but that\'s not the point here). The point is that this
rule system is... flawed, no other way to put it. (I can see
several people shaking their heads and saying "you mean you just
figured this out?") Hey, I\'ve always been a big believer in
classic traveller, and the spinward marches are about as classic
as you can get. But the point stands, there\'s something rotten in
the Lanth subsector, and it mostly likely extends from the whole
set of rules on UWP generation.

Let\'s take a closer look. What\'s going on in the rules to produce
these sort of unwelcome results? I think one of the problems is
real obvious. Just take a look at the order in which UWP stats
are being generated.

1. Starport       5. Population
2. World Size     6. Government
3. Atmosphere     7. Law Level
4. Hydrographics  8. Technology

The first thing wrong with this is actually the very first thing
we see. Why are we generating the starport first? Shouldn\'t starport
be determined by traffic, and shouldn\'t traffic be determined by
population? Hence, let\'s move starport after population (not in
the UWP listing, but in the order of stat generation).

Now (making this one change) let\'s start looking at cause and
effect in the rules.

The Stat        What modifies it
/----\\        /----\\
1. Size         (nil)
2. Atmosphere   (Size)
3. Hydro        (Size, Atmosphere)
4. Population   (nil)
5. Starport     (nil)
6. Government   (nil)
7. Law Level    (nil)
8. Technology   (everything but law level)

Now this is cute. Again, I always was a big believer in the
classic rules (maybe because I wanted to crawl in a hole when MT
came out), but let\'s take a look here. Specifically, let\'s look
at population. The rules would have us believe that you take any
given system, and regardless of its features, the primary world
or asteroid belt in one system is just as likely to have X amount
of people as the primary world or asteroid belt in the other
system. This, my friends, is way way out of line.

Think about it. You roll up some dinky little ice-ball as the
main world in your star system and then you try telling me that
the fact that this tiny speck of crud has no atmosphere, that it
has no liquid water, and that it hasn\'t even a modicum (I like
the word) of elbow room.... and then you try telling me it\'s just
as likely to have 50 billion people on board as that garden
terra-prime paradise just a couple of parsecs down the road. I
don\'t think so. Yes... you can explain it away. You can say, "Oh,
there\'s this wonderful lanthanum mine." Or you can say. "These
people live here... because it\'s their home" (and then smile
convincingly). But it doesn\'t work. This isn\'t a little
inconsistency. This is whopping big one. It\'s gigantic. It\'s
glaring. It\'s pesky and annoying (like me), but most of all, it\'s
just plain stupid.

Time for Jim\'s 1st Law on main-world generation (hey, if Newton
can do it, why not me?): Given that everything else is more or
less equal, people will tend to migrate to the place that is
"nicer". What I\'m saying is that worlds with a nice atmosphere,
some actual water, and so forth are gonna attract large
populations which will in turn build nice jumbo starports.
Planets that aren\'t so nice (you know the ones I\'m talking
about)... those planets will not attract people, and hence, they
aren\'t very likely to have lots of traffic or nice starports.
Jim\'s 2nd Law is likewise easy to grasp: People will attain the
resources (technology) that they need to survive such that those
resources are available. I.e., if you\'re really sure that you\'re
going to live on Sonthert, then you\'re gonna work damn hard to
acquire the technology you need to survive. TL3 doesn\'t cut it on
a near-vacuum planet. You need a little bit more (And I\'ve never
bought into the philosophy of high and low tech worlds living
side by side. For a short duration such as a few decades, I can
see it. Given special poltical or social circumstances, I can see
it. But in general, over the course of centuries, eventually
there will either be a leveling process or the low TL regions
will be brought up to snuff... and this is exactly what\'s
happening on our world).

Okay... now since I try not bitch about something unless I\'m
willing to work to fix it, here\'s my proposed modified-rules on
main world generation (if this begins to look like pseudo-code,
it\'s probably because it is).

1. World Size. Roll 2d6-2.

2. Atmosphere. Roll 2d6-7+Size.
   if size=0 then atmosphere=0.
   confine range to 0-F.

3. Hydrographics. Roll 2d6-7+Size.
   if atmosphere is 1 or less, then DM -4
   if size is 1 or less, then Hydro=0
   if atmosphere is A-C then DM -4
   if atmosphere is E then DM -2
   confine range to 0-A

4. Population. Roll 2d6-2.
   if size is 2 or less, DM -1
   if atmosphere is 3 or less, DM -3
   if atmosphere is A, DM -2
   if atmosphere is B, DM -3
   if atmosphere is C, DM -4
   if atmosphere if greater than C, DM -2
   if atmosphere is 6, DM +3
   if atmosphere is 5 or 8, DM +1
   if hydro=0 and atmos>3, DM -2
   confine range to 0-A

5. Starport. Roll 2d6 (use whichever table suits the locality
                       but remember that high rolls result in
                       a lower quality starport).
   if pop=0 then starport=X
   if pop=1, DM +2
   if pop=2, DM +1
   if pop is 6-9, then DM -1
   if pop is A, then DM -2
   confine range to A-X

6. Government. Roll 2d6-7+population.
   if pop=0 then gov=0
   confine range to 0-F

7. Law Level. Roll 2d6-7+government.
   if gov=0 then law=0
   confine lower bound of range to 0

8. Tech Level. Roll d6. Modify as per the standard chart.
   if pop=0 then tech=0
   otherwise, if hydro is 0 or A and pop is at least 6,
                 then tech must at least be 4.
              if atmos is 4, 7 or 9,
                 then tech must at least be 5.
              if atmos is 3 or less or A-C,
                 then tech must at least be 7.
              if atmos is D or E and hydro is A,
                 then tech must at least be 7.
   confine lower bound of range to 0

There, that wasn\'t so bad. I think you folks (at least those who
are interested) should be able to make sense of all of this. I\'m
throwing down some example UWP\'s to show you what sort of worlds
this modified system tends to create.

Note that there are some conspicuous differences between this
data and "normal" UWP listings. We get quite a few uninhabited or
very low-population star systems under the modified rules. Not so
under the original rules. I haven\'t checked yet, but I suspect
that this will probably bring down the average starport rating
for any given region (which is fine with me). Further, we don\'t
see lots of low-tech star systems. The lowest I see here is TL4,
and in both cases, we\'ve got a breathable atmosphere attached to
each planet (no assistance required, hence no technology required
in order to breathe). As we\'d expect, the yucky-foo worlds tend
to have lower populations and seedier starports. I\'m a bit
surprised that we have quite a few lush (atmos=6) worlds with
under ten million inhabitants. On other runs, I usually see very
high populations clustered on those worlds. Of course, when we
look at the highest population world in this run, we see that it
has a standard atmosphere, just as we\'d expect, so all in all,
it\'s not giving us really strange results on that count.

Now what I\'d like to do with this modified rule-set is get some
comments and criticism from you folks. Even though the TML
comprises a *very* small corner of the internet, it also has some
of the most devoted Traveller players I\'ve ever laid electronic
eyes on. So tell me... what do you think about the modified
rules? What problems do you see? What needs fixing?

I\'d like to "perfect" the program before distributing it, but if
you\'d like a copy for "experimental purposes", I can email the
QB45 source and/or the MS-DOS executable. What I\'m really looking
for here are suggestions. Do you like the modified system? Do ya
hate it? What about it needs improving? Probably a lot! From
reading this mailing-list in the past, I know that there is
*never* going to be a consensus on the TML regarding something
this broad-based and as fundamental to the rules of Traveller.
That\'s okay with me. I\'m not trying to please everyone (or even
the majority). I\'m just trying to get some ideas and a fair
critique (and what better place than the TML?).

Thanks for tuning in. Now back to the regularly scheduled
program.
