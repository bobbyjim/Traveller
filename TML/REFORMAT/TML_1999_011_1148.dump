The thing to consider is that the debris will follow a constant
velocity trajectory, while the ship is probably *still* accelerating. 

Also, the debris *does* spread out. And has many minutes to do so.

You *don\'t* point the laser. Not even with *current* weapons grade
lasers. Instead, you use an aiming mirror. the beam bounces off this
*very* precisely finished mirror and heads for the target. The lidar
for the laser (the "beam pointer" from some of the design systems) uses
the same mirror when determining the position of the target. 

And no, you can\'t give the missiles a similar coating. It\'d be
hideously expensive, and any imperfection would make it useless.
Including things like the scratches it\'d get being loaded and launched.

*Normal* mirror coating would just explode into vapor when the laser
pulse hit. After all, if a 50 MJ pulse hits a 99% reflective coating
(most mirrors are more like *80* %) that means that the coating absorbs
1% of the energy. That\'s 200 Kj. About the same as a fair sized bomb.
Which results in the coating exploding like said bomb. And strupping
the coating (and surface!) from large areas of the missile.

Note that the presence of a dust particle or the oils from a careless
fingerprint would do the same thing to the surface even if it was
*perfectly* reflecting. This is why the aiming mirrors get such special
treatment. :-)

Oh? At 150,000 km the lag is one second. At 15,000 km, it is .1
seconds. At 1500 km it\'s .01 seconds. All of these are, of course, in
addition to a fixed lag as the sensor system decides whether or not to
shoot. Personally, If my ship was *alone* and I knew missiles had been
fired, I\'d have the lidar pulse rate up fairly high, and upon receipt
of two returns from the "same" target, there\'d be a laser pulse on the
way back. And yes, it\'d switch to "smarter" aiming if there was some
huge number of returns. 

I figure that you\'d have active radar, and possibly active lidar, both
in "search" mode. If they detect something, they pass the co-ordinates
to the laser, which localizes the target using *its* integral ladar.
And once localized, the next pulse will be at *full* power, not
tracking power. :-)

You can add various optical and IR passive sensors to help determine
the location of incoming missiles. 

BTW, I think some folks here are operating under a *very* false
assumption. 

A missile trying to intercept your ship will *not* be "nose on" while
under power. The vectors just plain don\'t work that way. 

The only times this *could* be true would be if the missile had been
launched on a vector identical in orientation (or 180 degrees opposite
in orientation) from a ship *in line* with that vector. And as soo as
you changed your vector, it would *have* to turn to thrust in a
direction that would give it an intersecting vector, this will usually
result in it pointing at quite an angle to you. 

In fact, it\'s even possible for the missile to have to have it\'s
*exhaust* pointed at you due to the difference between your vectors.

Not bad. But you forgot the possibility that the S1A4/0098 *compliant*
board may be a Famile Spofulam 1202/zxyw. As such it\'s capable of
*wondrous* things... if your other gear could interface with those
functions. 

So it\'s *possible* that instead of replacing the FS board, you may find
it cheaper and/or more worthwhile to buy/build a protocol converter
that translates both ways between LS-1134/1107 and FS-1202/zxyw. 

Mind you, the "average" shipowner will prefer a "uniform" set of
boards/modules. On the other hand, the type of folks that are PCs or
notorious NPCs (like some guy named Solo?) will gladly use "mismatched"
parts if they can get some sort of advantage out of it. 

New Engineer: "Look at this mess! You\'ve got a *dozen* protocol
converters on the buss. And I don\'t even *recognize some of these
parts."
Skipper: "We\'ve got docs on all of them. Here\'s card with the specs.

places. But they don\'t tell you about all the protocol specific
features. Like the jump drive controller. Use standard Imperial
protocols and it\'s J-1. Use Bocchi protocols and it\'s J-2". 

After a quick double-take the engineer shares an evil grin with the
skipper as he pockets the data card. 

What PC *wouldn\'t* like to have the "official" specs on his ship be
somewhat different from the *real* specs?

Well some of us are of two minds about those. But given artifical grav,

It does. It\'s called the *exhaust*. A reaction drive works by throwing
stuff out the tail at high speed. And in a vacuum, it spreads out in
pretty much a cone. Also, you *can\'t* recess it too far. If you do, the
recess counts as part of the nozzle for the engine. With possibly
severe effects on thrust or on the material of the recess.

The "recess" also wastes both *space* and *mass*. Both are at a premium
in a missile. At least they don\'t have to be streamlined in space!

And you *can\'t* prevent the exhaust from radiating IR. In the IR
wavelengths, the missile will look like it\'s sitting on top of a coment
or something.

My point was that since you *can\'t* hide your position and velocity
*while* boosting, once you start coasting, your trajectory will be
known fairly well. The big problem is the exhaust, and the missiles own
IR emmisions. The IR emmissions are based on two and *only* two things.
First, the amount of energy produced inside the missile. Second, the
surface area. 

You can\'t do much about the first one. All the energy that is produced
*has* to leave in one way or another. And more than 99% of that energy
is the drive. Luckily, 90% of *that* leaves with the exhaust.
Unluckily, that 90% makes you very visible. And the other 10% heats up
the missile, which heat has to be radiated away from the surface of the
missile.

You can restrict the radiation to only some parts of the surface (with
a *lot* of creative engineering), but halving the area used to radiate
will increase the energy radiated per unit area by a factor of *4*. In
other words, that half of the ship is now *4 times* as bright.

Actually, it *won\'t* have some of the disadvantages of radar. Due to
the much shorter wavelngth, you *can\'t* create chaff. That\'s because
the foil strips in chaff are cut to *resonate* at various radar
frequencies, thus giving a *much* bigger return than a random length of
foil would. You can\'t do that with light. 

Also, again due to the higher frequencies involved, you can\'t generate
false returns as easily. 

BTW, ever work with "frequency agile" radar (that you can talk about)?
That kind of thing can *really* spoil your day. "Random" patterns of
pulses at "random" frequencies can be re-assembled it *very* good, and
non-spoofed, images if you know the pattern.

The problem is that such a missile has next to *no* chance of ever
hitting its target. It\'ll take *far* too long to get there. You see,
ships can keep boosting for *days*. That gives them velocities that a
missile just can\'t match. 

Being launched from a ship *helps*, but the missile has to make the
required velocity change to intercept the ship on its own. 

Unlike here on earth, the missiles *aren\'t* faster than their targets,
or at least not a lot. It might help to think of some of the old cruise
missile predecessors, such as the Bomarc trying to hit a B-52 or some
such. Both have similar speed and aceleration characteristics. But the
bomber has more *fuel*.

Actually those stories were in the 70s and 80s. Larry Niven\'s "Gil the

The problem is that mirroring is either not reflective enough, or both
hideously expensive and *way* too sensitive to damage. 

Consider that a mirror that reflects 99% of the incident light (a
*damn* good mirror, even by astronomical standards) is still going to
absorb 1% of it. 

If the light is a 50 MJ laser pulse, that means the mirror just got hit
by 200 kJ of energy. Which ought to ruin it thoroughly. 

The sort of 99.9999% coating you need can\'t survive the stresses of
getting loaded and fired. It\'s hard enough to keep the coating on the
(rather small) aiming mirrors for the lasers intact.

Just for fun:

That evil grin on the Engineer\'s face didn\'t mean what the skipper thought
it did. 

The Free Trader\'s next stop is a high law level planet, very corrupt.
The new engineer\'s brother-in-law is a starship inspector for that planet\'s
government. 

That data card is evidence for "deliberate, continuous safety violations,
posing an imminent risk to passengers, crew, and other vessels."
Specifically, the hotwiring of a jump governor only rated for Jump-1 so
that it\'s operating at 200% of safe rating.

(This of course assumes the drive wasn\'t originally designed to run with
the Bocci jump-2 controls, or that the modifications haven\'t been properly
approved by a starship safety inspector already.) 

The port inspectors were never supposed to know about this capability.
The skipper thought he could trust his engineer. Unless the skipper
thinks fast when the inspector "happens to have a copy of the protocols",
he may very well lose his ship* - and the treacherous engineer and his
brother-in-law will have a nice percentage of the seizure money (after
auction) to split.

The skipper and his loyal crew may wish to debate the point, possibly
by breaking into the impound yard and doing things that will wear out
their welcome in this system for some decades to come. ;-)

*Yes, *lose* it - not just get it impounded until repairs are made. The
inspector can make a case (at least, to the corrupt local officials)
that the captain has shown a pattern of deliberate and egregious safety 
violations. He\'ll be lucky to stay out of jail...or, alternately, springing him
from the local hoosegow can be part of the scenario.

When I first read about our (US) bills being redesigned, they were supposed
to have a bar-code.  The idea was to facilitate mechanical scanning of the

Why on earth (or any of the _other_ 13,000 worlds) would the Imperium
_care_ where and how you spend your money? Do you know the absurd mass
of useless information that would produce?

Some draconian law level worlds might do so, but it\'s highly unlikely
that the Imperium
would care...they get their power from the free flow of credits, not
tracking them.

Imperial taxes are low enough so as not to make them worth evading; more
than likely, many world\'s Imperial tax allotments are taken as part of
the berthing fees at the starports, and other such use fees rather than
direct taxation of commerce or the population at large.

As I said, the individual worlds may have taxes of their own, perhaps
quite high taxes, and may rigorously tax all such cash transactions.
More likely, though, cash will be
illegal on such worlds, amd trackable money cards will be used instead.

Not the board.  Just Ms. Rivlin and the language was just that

  Well actually in the game \'Mantis\', which is what I base a lot of my
reasoning on, You very rarely see your target. And if you do, it for a
brief few seconds as you fly by it at several thousands of Kilometers per
hour. Unless of course your able to match velocity and vectors, which is a
art under it\'s own. Like I said it uses real Newtonian physics. Lasers have
an extremely long range, but at those ranges it is hard to hit, because you
are the one targeting it, not some computer, which IMHO would make for a
very boring game.

I would think that both concepts would apply to a Web site of this
type.  The trademark information deals with such terms as "Traveller"
and "GURPS Traveller."  The copyright part would apply to the quotation
of material from various publications pertaining to Traveller, GURPS
Traveller, etc.

Of course, I\'m not a lawyer, but I\'ve gamed with one....

ObTrav:  How important was the Vilani concept of intellectual property
rights, as compared to Solomani concepts, in restricting technological
advancement and enforcing orthodoxy?

  Displacement is not (AFAIK) terribly significant here, it\'s the ability to

I\'d think on that one a bit.  There are mirrors for X-rays, they just don\'t
work for both x-rays and visible light, just as most windows are opaque to
IR but pass visible light.

Just to let everyone know that I\'ve rediscovered one of my favorite SF

The site has lists of miniatures produced by manufacturers, online rules
for games, and contact information. It is a slow site but worth the
wait.

This could be the enabler that permits me to blow tons of cash 8-D

The Superior Models Starfleet Wars line is exactly as I always
envisioned Trav battle fleets.

Hmm, how is the market doing today.

Apparently most counterfeit bills are detected by touch/feel.  You should
have seen the machine they have to mangle bills.  Things like the fancy
holograms and foil got thrown out early, the mangler showed that they
stopped being effective REAL fast.
Probably what happened to bar codes, even though the show didn\'t mention

Well, relative velocity isn\'t, by itself, relevant to a firing solution, it
is the distance from the observed point at the time the resulting lase
arrives that matters.  For this, d=at is the appropriat formula.  Ship X
sees missile Y, determines a solution (Instantaneously, no less!) and fires
a PDL.  By the time the laser reaches the point at which the missile was
observed .00999 seconds ago, the missile can be anywhere within an a circle
with a radius of (d=at, or .4895m=[49m/s/s][.00999s]) .4895m.  This will
ensure a clean miss the majority of the time against a small missile, even
at only 10% thrust.  If, like ships, the missile can use more of its thrust,
the solution becomes virtually impossible, barring luck or extremely close
range.  And again, all this assumes literally insantaneous tracking,
aquisition, solution and firing.  IMHO, you would have to wait to very close
range to have a good chance to stop an evading missile, or have a LOT of
PDLs.

According the Classic Era data in Galactic 2.4:

Jokotre:        1 belt          0 Gas Giant
Grille:         0 belt          1 Gas Giant

The problem is that according to the rules one can\'t have a thrusterplate in a
missile, right? If you can use thruster plates on missile the hole thing changes
and it becomes a question how much heat the power-plant in the missile produces
and how much it can radiate away. 

Also I can\'t see that cooling of an exhaust is a vaiable way to go, that is
going to cost more than you earn and the result is a very low thrust value and a
hot missile body. Heat is simply the limiting factor for low detectability for
missiles. If hotter the missile is the easier it is to detect. The problem is to
agree on a lower limit on hoe hot a missile is before it is automatically
detected. I\'ll check Bruce\'s sensor rules and see what they say. I think that
its going to be a fairly low value.

Yes, but you still need som type of radiator and this has to be pointing away
from the direction of travel of the missile. This gives you a very limited
amount of space as the missile also needs surfaces for electronics, like laser
comms, sensors and so on. How much space can you devote to radiators and are it
enouch to cool down the missile to below the detection value? Without having
done the number I would guess no, but as soon as I get home (I\'m currently on La
Palma doing recovery-observations of Kuiper-belt objects :-) I\'ll run the number
to see what I get.

I don\'t know about other design systems, but "standard" missiles in
T4/FF&S2 can\'t use thrusters, since:

1.  The "standard" missile size in T4/FF&S2 is 7 m^3 (7 metric tons
mass).

2.  The minimum volume of thrusters comes out to 10 m^3 (regardless of
thrust), which leaves exactly -3 m^3 for power plant, warhead, and
tracking mechanism.

While contragrav drives have no minimum size, they do not function well
outside a significant gravity well, and thus would be essentially
useless in space combat, which can easily take place outside a
significant gravity well. 

I assume that one could design larger missiles (and larger launchers to
fire them, but the larger the missile gets, the more easily tracked and
intercepted it becomes.

I\'m sorry for asking what may seem like a dumb question, but I missed the
first part of the thread. 

Instead of using PDLs, why can\'t the defending ship fire some sort of
flechette shotgun round into the probable path of the missile? Even if it
is a contact det-laser  missile, the warhead is unlikely to be pointed at
the ship if it goes off early.

For the same reason you can\'t realistically use ballistic weapons vs.
spaceships themselves- both the missile and the target are constantly
changing velocity.  Once fired, the flechette doesn\'t.  Result, after the
first evasive action, the flechettes are out of the picture.  While I
suppose at really, REALLY close range they might actually hit the missile,
they will in no way stop it- after all, the mass of the missile IS the
warhead.  No fuzes or whatever to disable, the mass will still hit.

I thought that we are talking about the HIWG Traveller CD here.  Oddly
enough, this is a compilation of material created by all Traveller players
who have been kind enough to allow it to be published free-of-charge. All
Traveller players, not just Windows users. In fact, it even contains data
created by people without computers.

I was planning on converting those MacDraw files to GIF format, so that
both formats could be included. Now I\'m wondering if I should bother. If
Dom, Bruce, Richard, Fred, myself, and the rest of the Traveller Macintosh
community have to burn our own CD anyway, why should we share with the rest
of you?

Does that sound petty and silly?  It does to me. So does telling 10-20% of
the Traveller community that they aren\'t wanted, when including them is so
easy. (I have at least three students who can burn hybrid CDs, and none of
them are computer \'whizzes\', so it can\'t be that difficult.)

This toleration business works both ways.

All right.  Are you assumimg missiles with _no_ explosive warhead at
all, relying on kinetic energy to penetrate the target?  If so, don\'t
forget to include the considerable mass of the kinetic penetrator
against your missile\'s net acceleration.  If not, then you have a
missile vulnerable to premature detonation from either a PD laser hit or
a single flechette from an expanding-cone flechette round.  Further, a
missile with an explosive warhead is _much_ less able to maintain its
shape upon impact than a hard-penetrator kinetic "warhead."  The _mass_
of the missile in such a case is about like throwing modeling clay
against a brick wall; the modeling clay will splatter _long_ before the
brick wall gives way.

I suspect that you are assuming missiles that can ignore the
(Traveller-modified) laws of physics, with the ability to maintain
incredible acceleration over a distance of 300,000 km, and able to jink
at will throughout that distance.

When I crunch the numbers, using FF&S2, I can\'t get anything _near_ the
50Gs acceleration you postulate, for enough time to cross 300,000 km.
(BTW, for those using High Guard, please note that sandcasters are as
effective as beam weapons in defending against missiles.  This indicates
that proximity warheads are vulnerable to the "cloud of BBs" effect that
sandcasters can achieve.)

Please keep in mind that, given a limit to total net acceleration, each
evasive maneuver performed by a missile subtracts from that missile\'s
ability to maneuver upon approaching the target area.  Of course, if one
decides to allow missiles (nearly) unlimited maneuverability, without
regard to size or thrust agency, then all bets are off....

Well then why not create a large bus vehicle to move the missiles within
range of extremely high-G short duration drives?  It would be more like the
old scatterpack shuttle from SFB, but if it is a few tons displacement, it
should be able to carry several missiles and perhaps targeting or self
protection equipment.

Depending on how the vehicle is designed, it could be either an expensive
one-way bus or could either be picked up or guided back to the launch ship
for re-use.

Actually, if I\'ve followed this thread correctly, your plan to convert
materials to cross-platform formats (GIF from MacDraw, etc.) is the best
way to work this project.  In fact [ObTrav], this seems to tie in nicely
with the Imperial Data Package (IDP) thread that is currently in
progress.  In the 3I, major computer projects would probably be targeted
at IDP-compliant formats, with regard neither to the peculiarities of
other formats, nor to the efficiencies possible by targeting data to a
specific format.  To use a late 20th Century Terran parallel, using JPEG
and GIF formats, which are supported (to some extent) by both Mac and
Windows OS, is preferable to using formats native only to one or the
other OS (assuming that one wishes to reach the widest possible
audience).

This, BTW, is why my Web site uses RTF as the text format for
downloading ship designs:  AFAIK, both Mac and Windows machines can read
RTF.

> This toleration business works both ways.

Yes, it does.  This is why I ask that you do as much as you can to make
the HIWG CD as cross-platform as possible. After all, _I_ didn\'t ask
Micro$oft to prevent me from producing hybrid CDs (a moot point, since I
don\'t have a CD burner...).

In return, when I post word-processing documents to my Web site, I will
use RTF, if I believe that the formatting is important, rather than
posting .doc files.  If the format is not important to me, then I will
post plain text files whenever possible.  (I currently can\'t do much
about the zipped Excel files I post in addition to the RTF ship
descriptions, unless someone can suggest a cross-platform compression
system, or unless there is a demand for the uncompressed Excel 5.0
spreadsheets.)

This may be feasible.  However, AuricTech Shipyards\' R&D budget does not
currently allow for development of such radical missile-launching
techniques.  Were we to receive an R&D contract, however.... ;-)

Your right, I just looked at the slackware partition on the ip-masq box

Funny you should ask.  There\'s a beta on their website (and mention of a
MAC beta as well--hmmm, this could run on quite a few platforms).  Since
it\'s
beta, there aren\'t any rpm\'s yet, and I\'m a bit hesitant to recomend it
just
yet.  I\'ll be building against the new libs once the I finish up a
couple of
features I\'ve been working on (probably this weekend).

FWIW, I\'m ftp\'ing the above page with screen/print shots as I write

Ding! Ding! Ding! Folks, we have a winner -- that is exactly the result we
were trying to achieve. The idea was to avoid a guaranteed "money machine",
without making it impossible for free traders (i.e., the player-characters)
to survive. This *is* a game, after all. (Or you can see it as a
theoretical justification for an empirical phenomenon in the Traveller
universe: the existance of free traders.) Moreover, as Jim points out in
considerable detail, if there is a guaranteed profit to be made, shippers
will simply undercut each other or oversell themselves until the profit is
just barely adequate again.

Three percent losses per year is the high end estimate, so the corps *can*
get their money out of shipping, they just won\'t make a killing (or the
current assumptions won\'t need adjusting, as the case might be).

>TL10, J2 freighters larger than 3000DT are a waste of money!

For average cargo, maybe. This is a nice result, actually, considering the
size of the canonical general cargo freighters we have (the Oberlindes and
Akerut designs from The Traveller Adventure/FT). 

If you\'re still not tired of it, however, run the numbers again using only
bulk cargo. I think you\'ll find the optimum size is considerably larger.
Hence the term, "bulk freighter."

>(will you allow me scaleable unloading rates now?)

Depends on what you mean by "scaleable": it\'s a non-trivial problem. 

In general, cargo loading and unloading rates depend on the number and
placement of cargo hatches, in relation to the configuration of the berth.
To first approximation, the contact area between the berth and the ship
goes up only as the 2/3 power of ship volume. Then you have to consider the
effect of different hull forms on generic highport hatch placement (most
cargo moves by unstreamlined freighter, from highport to highport). 

Unless the berth is specifically designed to fit the ship (which gets into
overhead costs for facilities at each port of call), you may well have to
move each hatch in front of a hatch on the highport, unload the
corresponding cargo bay, and then move to the next. Halfway through, you
have to turn the ship around and do the other side. This means
approximately the same loading/unloading rate as a ship with only one cargo
hold. (This is a realistic concern, by the way, and one that plagues
shippers and port engineers alike in the real world.)

Streamlined ships unloading onto a flat landing pad have an easier time
(can unload from both sides simultaneously, etc.) but have their own
problems, starting with the 20% volume penalty.

I\'m sure there are economies that can be achieved, and I\'m working on that
very problem right now for GT: Starports and GT: Starships both. In the
meantime, I\'ll be interested to see what solutions you come up with.

 Isn\'t a*t for velocity? For gunnery it\'s the rate of change of the future
position prediction, not merely the displacement represented by any current
vector; a non-manuevering target is an auto-hit to absurd ranges in space.

  IIRC the previous debate correctly, it\'s been demonstrated that at the

regardless of the missiles composition; silly putty or clay would have
problems with balancing the missile, though :)

At 100+km/s the wall is toast. No question.

Diving into water is no problem, try it from an airplane. Splat! :-)

At traveller ship/missile velocities there isn\'t time for the
splatter process to take place the way it does when you chuck it at
the wall. The exact model will differ based on projectile/target
interactions, but not nearly as much as with tank rounds (0.5-2
km/sec. maybe), and nothing like m/s stuff like throwing clay by
hand.

Modern smokeless powders carry their own oxydants.  Therefore, they don\'t 
*need* atmospheric oxygen to burn.  Yeah, guns *will* work in a vacuum.

they will have this sorted out, but at the moment it is a stumbelling block to
the .earth and .mars domains that NASA has in planning.

Almost correct. You use lots of Lasers in a frequency division multiplexing
mode accross the "beam" of the laser communcator, or lots of different
coloured lasers in one beam, but you only get one beam due to the spred. But,
if you can cause damage at light second distances with lasers, you should be
able to minimise the spread (focus the beam) to an extent where you can get
multiple communication beams to the same point, or a cupple of meters apart anyway.

You would also not only be using lasers to communicate, you would stream with
anything that would move segnificant amounts of data, menson and microwave.
For an analogy think about your computer sending data down it\'s ethernet card,
all serial and parallel ports, and it\'s infrared port all at the same time.

Ultimatly the Xboats will be set up to pump as much data accross it\'s lasers
and radio as posible for the TL. It might take an hour average (wild
uneducated gess) for the tender to hook up the xboat for a physical download,
and you can pump *vast* amounts of data in that time. We can do around 4000
Gigabits of real data in an hour, just with laser and microwave links, at
todays technology (streamed 622 Mb ATM maxed out, accounting for the 9.5% overhead).

> So instead the really *high* priority messages will get sent, then some

My thinking would be the stuff that needs to be on the next Xboat out-system
will be moved by laser/radio/menson, and the stuff that stays in system can
wait for the tender. This would probably give you the quickest data flow
between systems while you get a small delay when the data arrives at it\'s detination.

You would then get into communication logistics as to what gose where in what
priority, but then the Xboat has a week in jump to sort all that out, and it
gives the pilot something to do.

IMHO what this would mean is that changing the xboat system would be a lot
harder than just upgrading the Xboats themselves to Jump 6, but would involve
a massive rethink of the communication logistics involved in the current
system and how to adabt it to any new one.

I\'ll shut up now as I seem to be ramballing somewhat, and it\'s getting late.

I was under the impression that "black powder" is self-oxidizing as well -- 
that is, gunpowder should work fine.

Actually, I asked the same qeustion some years ago (1980, in fact) of the 
folks at GDW.  The point they suggested to keep in mind is that a weapon 
designed for use in atmosphere would be prone to vacuuum welding, and so be 
very likely to missfire or to jam permanently.

Shipboard lasers are more likely free-electron lasers. Chemical lasers
would require prohibitive amounts of fuel (the chemicals).

Slight problem. How are you managing to get a 5 ton missile that can
accelerate at 50g for multiple turns (several hours)?

That\'s one of the things people have trouble grasping. In Traveller,
the missiles *can\'t* out-accelerate the targets, except at ridiculously
short ranges. The intercept requires a marathon runner, not a sprinter.

To have a decent chance of hitting the target, it needs a velocity a
couple of orders of magnitude higher. 100 to 1000 km.sec.

And laser pulses don\'t "burn through" targets. The energy deposition is
so sudden that it acts *explosively*. Being liquid will make the slug
*easier* to disrupt.

Easy. Such things *may* be useful as a last line of defence, but
frankly, the speeds and distances involved are just too high. 

Consider that the ships and missiles are moving at relative velocities
of *hundreds* if not *thousands* of kilometers per second. And are
initiating combat at tens to hundreds of *thousands* of kilometers. 

If the missile is moving at 500 km/sec, and is 1000 km away, it\'ll hit
in 2 seconds. Your "shotgun" isn\'t likely to have a muzzle velocity of
more than 10 km/sec. Which means that if it was fired when the missile
was 1000 km away, it\'d intercept the missile at a distance of 19.6 km.
That\'s *way* too close for comfort. And the missile would have had 1.96
seconds to dodge.

On the other hand, a laser fired at the same time would intercept the
missile at 1000 km (minus a cm or two).

Excuse me? Are you *sure* the rules *allow* a fusion rocket engine that
small?

Chemical lasers require *huge* amounts of fuel. Said fuel tankage is
not in the rules. So that pretty much limits us to free electron
lasers. These use a magnetic field to "wiggle" a stream of electrons at
the desired lasing frequency.

Which rules say that? CT has the missiles having to "chase" the ships.
Missiles are explicitly stated to have the same vector as the ship they
are launched from. And then they finally released the errata that said
what acceleration and endurance the missiles had (turned out to be
measured in g-turns). 

Ditto for Mayday.

Flight time is the killer here. If the ship changes course, the
projectile misses. So it has to be able to move fast enough to get
there *before* the ship can change course significantly. And getting
that much energy into the missile is hard. Moreover, it\'d be better
used to drive the missile. 

The one exception was the "nuclear shotgun". Basicly a design that
manages to apply most of the energy of a nuke into kinetics energy of a
spray of pellets. The pellets move fast enough to do damage, and they
spread over enough area to have a decent chance of at least one
hitting the target in spite of evasive manuevers.

Try assuming that you have 1G for the first 300,000km, 10G for the
next 10,000km and 100G for the last 1,000km.

Of course you still can\'t avoid the PDL fire but it might be possible to

It\'s a pdf file. That means you need a copy of the Adobe Acrobat reader
to view and print it. PDF is a sort of "electronic publishing" format.
It lets you have text in various formats, hypertext links between
sections, and graphics. 

You\'ll need to be running at least Windows 3.1 if you are using a PC.
There\'s not a DOS reader for PDF. There are Win 3.1, Win 95/98, Mac,
Linux, and several other types.

These are hypervelocity impacts. The impactor *explodes* on impact, and
the KE of the projectile gets turned into explosive energy. At 3 km/sec
the impact energy is equal to the explosive energy of of an equal mass
of TNT. The impact energfy goes up linearly with mass, and goes up as
the *square* of the velocity. 

A 5 ton missile at 100 km/s has an impact energy of roughly 5.6
*kilotons*. At 1000 km/s the energy is over half a *megaton*.

At those energy levels it doesn\'t *matter* what the projectile is made of.

There\'s a lovely picture of the thumbnail sized *crater* in one of the
Space Shuttle\'s quartz windows. It was caused by a *paint chip*
weighing less than a gram, and traveling at a relative velocity of no
more than 10-15 km/s.

This is why *nobody* chasing a ship chases "straight up the tail". It\'s
too easy for the ship to dump the garbage and hope you hit a potato
peeling at a relevative velocity of a few hundred km/s. At 300 km/sec a
1 gram peeling will carry the energy of 10 kilos of TNT. That\'s a fair
sized satchel charge. 

So even on a straightforward "tail chase", you stay off to one side and
keep shifting around. The legendary "golden BB" is a bit to real in
that situation. :-)

A couple of ships accelerating in *opposite* directions for a few hours
and then making a "firing pass" are going to have a closing velocity
such that there\'s no *point* in even a nuclear warhead. It wouldn\'t add
significantly to the energy release!

Also Ladar cannot be used to search for targets, only to lock on to targets
already acquired with another sensor, Ladar or lidar is a point system, not
an area search system.

I suppose High Guard for one, although it doesn\'t have a movement
system as such and I would not like to use its "movement system"
as the basis for any "how things work" arguements.

Interesting thought:

If I engage missile cruisers at long range with laser cruisers,
shouldn\'t I be able to destroy the ships at long range on turn one
and then shoot their missiles on turn two?

I have been toying with an idea about the x-boat ships in my universe... 
Does anyone know what speed and bandwidth one can get from a laser. I was 
trying to design the X-Boat so that after it entered the system it would 
open up its conical shaped frame and present an extractable umbrella like 
dish with the ship being the center structure - I was hoping I could get 
a area radius of about 700 meters or more. Would this speed up 
communications and maybe allow a wider laser beam to the 
sending/recieving station on the world.

*All* xray mirrors are what is called "grazing incidence mirrors". They
can only reflect x-rays that hit them at a shallow angle. At steeper
angles, the x-rays go thru. So they aren\'t practical for a missile coating.

It\'s not the sort of thing that can stay secret. To be usable, it has
to be of a size that\'s *visible* otherwise it\'ll degrade too much from
handling (check out some of those fine details on the new bills).

I liked the test where they crammed the bill into a tube narrower than
a pencil and only an inch or two long. They had to use an arbor press
to force it all the way down. Then they had to pull out the muchly
wrinkled bill.

Nope. It\'s a *polymer* strip. Hold a new bill up to the light and
you\'ll be able to see the strip. It\'s got the denomination of the bill
on it. In fact, as I recall, they added the strip to the *old* 20s and
hundreds for a while before the switch to the new design.

Oxygen *is* the oxidant. The correct question is what is the *reducing
agent* (aka "fuel"). 

It could be the atmosphere. In the case of the Apollo I fire, it was
the *oxgen line*. That is, the line caught fire and the oxygen jetting
out let the tubing burn like mad while spraying a jet of superheated
oxygen. The various metals in the control panels and capsule structure
ignited from that...

Ever watch someone use a cutting torch? That bright white shower of
sparks is *steel* burning in a jet of oxygen.

Try "Make love" on various versions of make. You\'ll discover an *old*

I\'ve lost the original, so I\'ll piggyback here.  The DGP World Builder\'s

given world has.  

It\'s far too involved to post, even if that didn\'t bust copyright.  Sorry.

	[[REPLY from Steve Lieb]]  from my short experience with Mantis,
it does use physics in terms of movement, but there the reality ends.
	For a truly realistic system, you need to simulate the lag ANY
detection system would have at the tremendous ranges involved.  At
150,000km (not an uncommon range for space scales) you\'d have a full
second lag in the time it would take any active sensor to register the
ship (ping to craft, bounce, return).  Passive sensors, ironically would
be MORE accurate since the lag would effectively be halved.  And if the
ship is moving at 1000kph (creeping, in space terms) this moves it 300m
in that second - far enough to easily avoid any sort of beam fire.  Of
course, if a ship was moving on a set course, the targetting could be
plotted and would be accurate.  But I would imagine at the first sign of
any danger, the computer\'s first move is to add a random vector-altering
component to the thrust direction.

	Of course, this means that space combat using direct-fire
weapons is a matter more of ambushing the prey or combat of last resort
against a determined or helpless foe.  (It also suggests why ships are
vulnerable on their way to the jump point - if you\'re using you maximum
acceleration as adding to your singe forward vector, you have no
acceleration for erratic maneuvers.)

	Almost all forms of explosives (except fuel-air explosive)

	However, vacuum causes some other problems. Weapon components

	materials and surface finishes, and using suitable lubricants 
	which do not evaporate in vacuum.

	While most common projectile types (bullets) are spin- 
	stabilized, some modern projectiles require atmospheric drag for 
	stabilization (flechettes, air-rifled shotgun slugs). Therefore 
	air-stabilized projectiles may be more inaccurate when fired in

Well, I was accosted by a small, disc-shaped flying object full of
\'droyne\' who were obviously inebriated.  They handed me a disk and went
on their way.  I plugged this disk into my Hewlett-Packard 125 C/PM
machine and ran it.  On the disk was \'ancient\' BASIC.  Of particular
interest was the droyne version of \'ANSI\' which consisted of an arcane
bit of symbols and control codes.

For instance, replacing the CLS command was this :

print chr$(7)+"h"+chr$(7)+"J"

  Presumably High Guard is assumed to be based on a vector system, as
the detailed CT (& CT-era stuff like Triplanetary) space combat systems
are vector based (B:2, Mayday). The old Dragon article to that effect
is a bit limited by its shortness, but you could play it as the above but
using Agility (before mods for Pilot 3+) as maneuver-G\'s.

But not necessarily visible to the *human* eye...  ;)

Seriously though, it would be possible to barcode the bill in such a way
that the code is not visible under normal light and is only detectable by
a scanner of some type. Then the code could be nice and big, and repeated
several times, on the bill so that it never becomes too mangled to read.

IIRC, you can fire them, HOWEVER you\'ve the problem of recoil.  You might
want to see what information you can find on a \'GyroJet\' Pistol (I believe
that is the correct name), I\'m pretty sure it was designed in the 60\'s with
a limited number made.  Each bullet is actually a miniature rocket.

BTW, this is from a book on guns I read in the early 80\'s so I might be 
remembering some details wrong.

Throughout the WBH section on mapping the world, there are statements like
"Exact placement of \'X\' is left to the one drawing the map"

Mapping worlds is a labor intensive process, still.

There are rules in the book regarding city size and placement as it varies by
tech level, but the very best reference for mapping worlds is a good atlas.
Cities on Earth arose via pretty much natural selection...they flourished
where conditions allowed them to. They\'re built around transportation hubs, or
heavy concentrations of resources, such as good ports, natural transport
pathways, or good water supplies for irrigation and such. In fact the only
city I can think of otherwise, is the capital of Brazil, Sao Paolo, which is
an extensively \'planned\' city. 

It is also a city planned by people way back in the 60\'s with 60\'s utopian
visions and ideals, and as such, as a 90\'s city in Brazil, it doesn\'t work
very well. Everyone ended up living in a welter of suburbs around the city,
which grew helter skelter as cities do, rather than in the planned capital.
There are also serious problems such as that the original planners really,
REALLY liked the automobile, so Sao Paolo has extensive roadways, and little
provision for pedestrians, a design that automatically selects against people
actually living there. 

I could go on about the folly of planning a city around vehicle roadways, but
that\'ll turn into a major OT rant real quickly...we have city managers
simultaneously talking about the need for elevated roadways and freeways
cutting across the city and on out the 30 miles to the suburbs that people
spend 7-8 hours a day sleeping in when they\'re not working or commuting, and
bemoaning how impersonal and disconnected everyone in the city is. Grrrr...

In worlds settled at higher TL\'s city placement may be a little looser, but
they\'re still going to be someplace convenient...with our current tech level,
we could sustain a megalopolis in the Himalayas, but it would be prohibitively
expensive, and there is no earthly reason to do so...novelty is not a valid
reason to spend billions on a city and it\'s infrastructure. Remember cities
don\'t spring to life full blown...much like organisms, they grow.

obTRav:The invention of cheap, affordable antigrav: Boon or Bane? It allows
people hitherto unknown freedom of building and living where they please, thus
allowing them to be isolated even more from each other. What are the
sociological consequences of everyone wanting to have a fantasy home built on
unreachable, save for air-raft homes in the crags of the Rockies? Visualise
this: Antigrav SUV\'s (and the attitude that will come with _those_!)

the Meson Support Sled.  I was dissapointed to say the least, TL-15 and the

should be released from service, at the least, IMO.

But it did get me to thinking.

If a Meson gun needs to be physically pointed at the target, and using the
Meson sled or conventional spinal mount requires moving the entire vehicle,
 why not build a platform that uses a mount similar to a Deep Site?

It could be put in almost any size hull, providing the dimensions are
adequate.  Here is an outline of my thinking...

1.  Design the meson weapon.
2.  Develop it according to the Deep Site rules and find the weight and
requirements needed for everything *inside* the hollowed out sphere it
would operate in.
3.  Design the host platform, ship, boat, or vehicle to carry it.  
4.  Use the volume of the sphere (determined in step 2) as the volume of
the weapon.  Add a slush fund of maybe 10% for additional structural
support and bracing required.
5.  Treat the weapon "sphere" as a seperate mount and crew normally.

If you create self contained or booster power plants for these weapons you
could rebuild old SDBs or other craft into self contained Meson Gun
batteries for not only indirect fire (Ortillery), direct battlefield
support, or a harassment weapon in the event the world is overrun. 

The nice feature is that the craft could mount as many or as few of these
as necessary.

I believe that in G:T missiles do indeed have thruster plates. So it again
comes down to which system are you using?
I believe in GURPS Traveller the game is balanced so that against typical PC
craft 100, 200 and 400 Ton Free Traders that missiles are ineffective. PD is
allowed using all Laser Turrets, even those fired during that turn, and
sandcasters can be used against missiles (the rules saw that the sand is
capable of damaging the missile enough to make it miss.) Targets can be
engaged upto 600 x ROF (which is 1/60 for standard lasers @ GTL12) That\'s 10
missiles. Since only one missile can be controlled by each missile rack a
400 Ton ship firing on a 400 ton ship will never be able to overload the PD.
On the other hand a missile by can control 50 missiles. So a major combatant
could easily overload a small ship\'s point defense, if they can get the
missile\'s close enough. On the gripping hand a large ship could just fire a
couple of dozen lasers at the small ship and frag it too.
I haven\'t played out all these various tactical presentations yet, but I
intend to do some serious simulations Real Soon Now.

Before someone asks:Free electron lasers use a beam of electrons to create
the laser. In present technology the electrons come from an electron gun and
are typically accelerated by a radio frequency cavity and then put through a
wiggler. Every time the direction of the electron beam is changed photons
are produced.  if you pick the right size of wiggler you can control the
frequency of the photon beam and so produce x-rays;so an x-ray laser.

I\'m not sure what prompts you to say this, Keven, but it\'s wrong.
No modern commercial powder (and virtually no military powders)
contain an oxidizer (not oxydant) as an integral part of their
composition.

Modern cased ammo works because (with some exceptions) the case is
not air-tight.  Even in situations where the case *is* air-tight
(i.e. lacquered S&B military-grade ammo), there is sufficient O2
inside the case to ignite the powder.  By the time the O2 in the
case is consumed, sufficient gas expansion has occurred to force
the slug from the case neck and expose the remaining (unconsumed)
powder to outside air.  This additional O2 supply completes the
job.

As a result, standard modern cartridges will either a) fail to fire
in vacuum, or b) behave like "squib" rounds if a small amount of air
has remained sealed inside the case.  The latter behavior may render
your firearm unusable, depending upon how far the slug travels into
the barrel before becoming lodged.

BTW, unlike black powder, modern "smokeless" gun powder does not
explode, it simply burns rapidly (and, yes, there *is* a difference.)

Cabal, Rob, I prefer Traveller Macintosh Cabal ;-) Seriously, the
burning of the hybrid CD only has to be done once, the CD duplication
cares not one tittle whether it\'s a ISO9660, Redrocks, Hybrid, Romeo or
Joliet CD, it only cares that it\'s a disk image. 

Unfortunately, what this does mean, given the lack of a hybrid HFS/ISO
program other than Toast on the Mac, is that the CD has to be built in
whole or part on a Mac. Worse, since the only ISO-9660 with redrocks
extension program I\'ve been able to find is mkisofs, which _doesn\'t_ do
hybrid, <sigh> the actual dream of a universal data disk is still
restricted, pretty much to the lowest common denominator: ISO9660-I,
which is 8+3 ALL CAPS filenames.

Seriously, I don\'t have a problem with the format of images, so long as
their utility is preserved. The problem with converting vector formats
like MacDraw, or Pict to GIF is that you\'re converting it to a bitmap,
which loses the primary advantage of a vector file, which is it\'s
scalability.

What the world seriously lacks is an easy to use, portable _vector_
image format. There are WMF and the various program files on the Windows
side (which many Mac programs can open), Pict and the various program
files on the Mac side (which Quicktime and many PC programs can open),
and Postscript everywhere. 

While postscript is definitely not a low-end thing, the Ghostscript
suite of programs exists on: Mac, Amiga, Atari, Baskin-Robbins 31
flavors of Unix, OS/2, Win 3.11, Win95/8, Win NT, VMS, and probably
others I didn\'t see right off.

Rhat awn, bruvver!

Though, in fairness, I must mention a neat-o little shareware program I
found, checking out Ghostscript:

Mayura Draw, which will output Postscript (though _any_ PS printer
driver will do that, just print to a file) it is a $15 drawing program
for Win95/NT, quite nice looking. At http://www.mayura.com

I\'ve been looking for a decent drawing program for my peecee at work for
quite a while, and it looks like this\'ll do.

For \'bus that delivers short range high G missile in range of victim\' read
\'TARGET\'.

You have just described a pilotless fighter which will die from lightspeed
lag on comms from the launch vehicle. Plus, it carries many of your weapons
in one big, expensive basket. If you take the missiles in range for a short
range attack you are almost certainly in range of missiles. Maybe a KKM
launch (loads of ballbearings) would be most effective, but I don\'t think
this is practicable.

I don\'t think this is off-topic at all.

Take a planet that has been continuously occupied from TL 0 to TL 10.
High population, with population somewhat (though not entirely)
concentrated in urban centers.

Assume that one or more of the urban centers was painstaking planned
by the original colony officers, based on centuries of Imperial experience
with city planning. When this urban center was built, population was
small and concentrated, and there were few personal vehicles. The
few personal vehicles that existed were grav vehicles, and there was 
a limited transportation network based on large land vehicles. 

This "First Landing" city will be made up of closely-packed buildings,
connected by pedestrian routes, with rooftop and ground-level open
areas for grav vehicle landings. There will be a few vehicular land routes,
associated with industry and mass transit - these land routes will be more
like train tracks than roads, even though the vehicles on them will more
likely be large ATV\'s than trains. Trains will come later.

As population grew, people settle around this "First Landing" urban
center, with urban planning falling by the wayside - the colony planners
were men of long vision, the guy laying out a farm just outside the
city is more concerned with his next crop than he is with where the
streets will go a century from now. Transport is still large ATV, and
grav vehicle transport is becoming less common. People start using
local beasts of burden for personal transport and even some cargo
transport. As population grows, average tech level drops - from interstellar
tech at the colony base, to what can be locally supported away from
the colony base. Transportation will be what the colonists brought with
them, the few grav vehicles and ATV\'s they can buy while the colony
is struggling, and, more and more, what they can produce locally.
Soon enough, the average method of transport will be beasts of burden,
or feet.

This hinterland around First Landing will have roads, laid out as they
have been in every agrarian society Earth has ever seen - they will 
wind serpentine up hillsides (so "horses" can haul a wagon up the slope),
they will follow ridgelines and watercourses, they will need bridges.
Instead of the ruler-straight streets of a planned city, these areas will
have roads that bend and squiggle. When towns spring up in this
hinterland, they will be based on roads with funny angles. Any satellite
cities that grow here (or elsewhere on the planet, for that matter) should
have remarkably Terran similarities for street layouts.

In addition to these roads, there will be the main transport routes.
ATV\'s will ply these routes, picking up cargos at transfer points
in the hinterlands, much like railroads served towns on Earth. At some
point, the colony may lay rails on these main transport routes and
start running real railroads, freeing the ATV\'s for opening up unsettled
areas of the planet.

Slowly, as the colony\'s infrastructure grows, average tech level rises.
As the colony passes through tech level stages, they build roads,
highways, railroads - and then they have grav vehicles again, as common
transportation devices. They\'ll stop building new roads, but may maintain
and use the ones they have for slow, inexpensive transport.

What would the cities of this colony look like by now? Were the secondary
cities planned? If so, planned for what? There\'s quite a difference between
a city planned for grav traffic, a city planned for wheeled traffic, and a
city planned for foot traffic. 

I imagine attempts at city planning, both successes and failures,
can give a Traveller ref ideas. We\'ve got a lot of cities on a lot of planets
to create, seeing how Terran cities did it (or failed to do it) can be useful.

This then, IMO, would also invalidate the entire concept of missiles.  If
the lag is so bad that a bus vehicle that travels at missile speeds can not
get the payload within decent range, and outside PD range, then the entire
missile concept is flawed.  

If you add rudimentry gunnery software that would go in a robot, you would
be able to lessen the impact the lag would have.

Where do I apply to join the TMC? What is the initiation rite?

Seriously, I\'ve been burning cross-platform CDs for a while now. I
believe we are better off with a Macbinary wrapper around the files with
resource forks. I would suggest that someone create html index files for
the content of the CD. That way everyone can see the files.

While creator types and custom icons are nice reasons to go hybrid, make
sure everything gets run though a name checker like 

http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/disk/hybrid-filenam
e-checker-111.hqx

or

http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/disk/name-cleaner-1
91.hqx

I always gussy up my CDs with custom icons, file types, window
placement...

I didn\'t do filename check once and ended up with a bunch of live music
mp3 CDs containing all those characters PCs hate <>?* because I wrote it
on a Mac using toast. It is common in setlists to show "song 1 > song 2
> song 1" to describe a tease within another song. Windows hated that.
It gave me some message like " You can\'t open the file because the file
cannot exist"

I don\'t know of a PC CD utility which can burn Toast image files. I
tried with the MKLINUX CD image and all of the PC tools ( even adaptec\'s
) failed.

The ideal situation would be to have a rewritable hybrid master which
could be customized and tested for each platform before duplication.

By that arguement Earth can\'t possibly have spacecraft, since no Class B
starport exists.  Someone should inform the crew of the Discovery that
they\'re not really in orbit!  The way I see it, a functional starship could
be produced as a special engineering project.  Cost and time would be
enormously increased, since all components would have to be special ordered
and assembled individually, but it could be done.  Rules are a guideline,
not a straitjacket.

Proximity isn\'t.

Hmmmm....

black powder= Potassium Nitrate + sulfur + carbon: full system there.
smokeless (original style at least, I\'m not sure about the composition)
= nitrocellulose plus inert binder, IIRC. again, a complete mixture,
(dunno if there\'s sulfur in the smokeless mixture)

In both cases the nitrate serves as the oxidizer, the carbon (either
charcoal, or cellulose) serves as the fuel.

The sulfur is necessary, but it\'s been quite a while since I dredged up
my memory the chemical reactions involved, so I can\'t remember right
now.

There is a distinct diffeence in the rules regarding _star_ships versus
_space_ships. Earth does not yet have _any_ starport, as we have yet to
see _any_ starships.

We have some experimental TL-7/8 _space_ports, yes, and rudimentary
quasi-commercial _space_ports (Ariane space, that Boeing sea-launch
platform) and the ability to make some spacecraft components. Unless
you\'re sitting on some discovery I don\'t know about yet, and are just
teasing us terrans on the TML ;-) we don\'t have the ability to build
starship compnents at all, simply because we don\'t know what goes _into_
one yet.

True, the rules are a guideline, not a straightjacket, but the point is,
a class C port that can build starships isn\'t a class C port, but an A
or B one. the Definition of a class A port is a starport capable of
building starships from scratch; a class B is one capable of doing all
but jump drives, but given a supply of components can assemble
starships, a class C can refuel and do some repairs. If you can build
one, you\'re not a class C.

Notice, NOWHERE do the rules state how fast, or how many such ships you
can build in a given starport.

Glisten\'s Ling shipyards, and Harry\'s Custom Starship Yards may both
classify as Class A starports, but the Ling facility can build systems
of unlimited size, and can make dozens in a year, while Harry\'s, though
an excellent yard, is a custom shop, they make maybe one or two a year,
up to 500 tons, probably highly customized yachts for a select group of
customers.

A couple of ways of looking at this:

1.  Currently, Earth does not possess a Class B starport.  After all,
Discovery
_isn\'t_ a non-starship in the Traveller sense.  It is "a spacecraft of
marginal performance characteristics", scarcely better (compared to
Traveller starships and non-starships) than King David\'s Spaceship, from
which that description was lifted.

2.  Currently, Earth _does_ possess a Class B starport, as demonstrated
by the construction and launch of the previously-mentioned Discovery and
her sisters.  However, the non-starships built at TL-8 are, shall we
say, less capable than those commonly found in Traveller.

This seems to describe the development of the first Terran jump ships.

However, none of this helps to answer the original question.  Let\'s
assume, instead, that the TL-10 starport asked about _is_ a Class A
starport.  One example would be Fosey, in the Mora subsector.  Fosey is
TL-10, with a Class A starport, and has a population of 6 million. 
Mora, on the other hand, is TL-15, also with a Class A starport, and has
a population of 10 billion (figures from Classic Era, Galactic 2.4). 
What would be the relative production capacity of the two starports?

Fine, I made a poor choice of ratings in asking my question.  Thanks for 
making my one delurk after years of not playing the game and wanting to get 
back into it so enjoyable.  But you didn\'t help to answer the underlying 
question.

If you have two class A starports, one at tech level 11 and one at tech level 
15, shouldn\'t the second be able to outperform the first in more than just 
"zippier" ships?  I realize the second could cram more into the same amount 
of tonnage based on later TL shrinkage of fueld requirements, etc.  But do 
both produce the same number of "tons" per unit of time?  What would that 
value be?

And shouldn\'t a TL 15 B starport still be able to outperform a TL 11 A 
starport in some pretty significant ways?  I realize smaller ships that can 
jump farther is impressive, but what about other \'production quantities\'?

Maybe it should be based more on some other "production capability" of the 
planet itself?  Then, how might these naval bases that orbit a pretty 
lifeless moon be counted?

If there\'s nothing canon, I\'d appreciate some rules of thumb that someone 
might have found workable.  I have no idea where to begin.

I\'ve never heard that.

(In GT, they do, in fact, use reactionless thrusters.  Thought GT
hasn\'t, and I don\'t think will, commit itself to specific design
of how they work).

There are a bunch of ways to do this.  One obvious way is to
have the front of the missile, a pod that sticks out, etc.
covered with sensors and the back covered with radiators.  After
all, if the radiators need to point away from the foe and the
sensors point toward the foe, there isn\'t much need to put them
on the same surface.

Damn hard to answer, generically or individually...Mora certainly
handles more shipping in a year, but if Fosey is built around that
starport and the main business on planet is the Fosey Golden Lotus Lucky
Starship Company Ltd., they might make a lot more starships than you
might think given the disparity of populations and tech levels.

Off the cuff, of course more ships are built at Mora than at Fosey, but
without any acillary economic data, you stuck with rather general
qualitative descriptions rather than quantitative.

Simple answer..."Sorry Charlie, there\'s insufficient data on that."

Unfortunately, I don\'t know how to estimate these numbers either (not
having Free Trader or Pocket Empires, the only supplements that I can
think of that might include ways of determining such figures. Sorry
Trillion Credit Squadron doesn\'t count, as that\'s exclusively
wartime-footing military production only)

You are right about the weapon but I don\'t know if the name you gave it is
completely correct.  I have a friend who is a cartridge collector and he had
a cartridge in his collection.  It was really strange as it was shaped in
cross section like a wankel.  That is to say like an equilateral triangle
with rounded corners.  He said that it was very inaccurate but would scare
the hell out of anyone who had one coming their way.  It was like some sort
of Congreves rocket in miniature.   The round was spin stabilized by the
rocket exhaust upon firing.  The pistol was used in one of the Bond books.
Didn\'t the original Traveller set have a similar "rocket gun"?  If I
remember correctly it was a shoulder fired long gun which launched the
projectile with very little recoil and then the rocket motor fired up.  The
tables as I recall indicated it to be rather inaccurate as well.

aliens that were brought up using the stuff in the Library snubbing
their noses (or whatever) at the wolfling Humans who insisted on using
some homegrown stuff in their exploration craft.

Supplement 5: Trillion Credit Squadron, under the Campaign rules.

Shipyard capacity in dtons is Population/1000*Government Modifier. The
Government Modifier measures (generally) how authoritarian and aggressive a
world is, based on government type; the average is about 1 in peacetime,
and 1.2 in war.  Output is capacity divided by build time, which was given
in High Guard.

Class C starports have *no* construction facilities. Class B starports can
only construct non-starships. Class A starports can build both starships
and non-starships. No port can build a ship at a tech level higher than its
own.

Seems to be a force screen (p. VE93), but it cost, weight, and power
requirement are less than 1/10 listed value, the screen only works against
mesons, and it does not overload.

If you\'re using the first printing of the second edition, the errata say:

http://www.sjgames.com/errata/gurps/vehicles_2e.html

"In Maximum Range, under 1/2D and Max Ranges in Vacuum move the entry for
neutral particle beam from the " 10 if..." listing to the " 50 if ..."

  I believe that they\'re referring to the fact that not all rounds come

It is really hard to tell. A simple difference in tech levels won\'t
affect the _number_ of ships you can build in a year nearly as much as
how big the yards are.

Well, mostly, the problem is that you\'ve hit one of the _hard_ problems
of Traveller, specifically econometric modelling of the Traveller
Universe.

There are some easy rules of thumb: A higher TL shipyard of a given size
will produce a ship faster than a comparably sized yard of a lower TL,
_when_ producing ships of their main production line, and not custom
jobbies: ie a TL-15 yard will produce a TL-15 Beowulf faster that a
TL-11 one will produce a TL-11 Beowulf. This is due to differences in
automation, mainly.

Off the top of my head, were I forced to estimate in a gaming situation,
I\'d say it would be a variable of 10-15% time gain per TL (or two). So
the Mora (TL-15 yard) will produce that one in 3 months, and the Fosey
(TL11) one will do it in 6-9 months. The Fosey yard will require more
people to build, and by a strict interpretation of the rules, the two
ships will cost the same (which is, of course, absurd).

Now, look at producing at a lower TL than the max you can produce, say
the Mora yards decide to make TL-13 ships for sale to the outlying
regions, or TL-11 ones for the absolute boonies. Well, they\'ll likely
NOT get more of an advantage in time savings, since they\'re not changing
their automation any, but the ships _will_ be, per the rules, cheaper. 

What this means, in the overall picture, is that unless the Fosey yards
are getting some gigunda subsidies from somewhere, they\'ll go broke
faster than MC Hammer.

This is why it\'s hard to figure this out. Generally a great deal of the
economic activity that is depicted in the OTU has no business existing.
(such as TL-11 starship yards on pop 6 planets in the same subsector as
TL15 ones on pop A planets...it\'s _so_ much cheaper to buy your TL11
starship in the TL15 system)

Comparing type B yards vs Type A, it gets a little more dicey. Those
yards on the Type B yards have to import their jump drives from
somewhere, which _has_ to be more expensive than making your own, in the
main. 

But they\'ll have the advantage of greater automation, so I would guess
they get about half the time advantage of a comparable Type A yard, so
our TL15 B yard will still make that beowulf faster than our TL11 Type A
yard, but I don\'t think they\'ll get nearly as much of a price break,
either. 

Again, forced to off the top of my head, I\'d allow about half the
pricing differential that a Type A yard gets making things at lower
TL\'s. All _big-time_ MHO, and should any of the _real_ TML economics
types wish to jump in now, please do!

Not really. What you do is have a future set of random maneuvers plotted,
and each of the computers has an updated list of the \'expected conditions\'
for the next 10 seconds or so.

You still dont get the range. You might add 10 km/sec to the missile\'s net
velocity. Either use a laser and plan on engaging at 1000 km plus, or
invest the mass you were planning to spend on the gun on a bigger maneuver
drive.

First of all, the missile will presumably be jinking and such, so it wont
be nose on most of the time, so it\'s effective radius will be larger than
the nose (me, I build missiles as armoured spheres - did you see the Famile
Spofulam TL13 Anti Ship Missile/Customs Cutter ?).

Secondly, Famile Spofulam builds it\'s point defense lasers as standard grav
focussed ROF 1 shot per 2.5 seconds and 200 MJ and up lasers, as
thruster-plate missiles are very big and can work - if the enemy doesnt
have enough crunch power to chew through several centimeters of superdense
(*points to the 49 MJ \'point defense\' lasers on Gridlore ships*). Yeah,
yeah, yeah, 650 MJ is stretching the definition of \'point defense\', but at
that size the accumulator is so big you might as well take the bigger
rapid-fire lasing mechanism.

The other issue to consider is nukes in a defensive role - we send out a
bunch of nuke armed countermissiles, blowing them off to scratch any nice
shiny coatings, fry any cheap electronics and most of all force the missile
wave to spread out so our PD lasers can engage them a few at a time.

At engagement ranges the missiles are presumably coming from a small arc of
space - probably less than one degree. I dont believe this would be too
much of a problem.

Please build us a 50G missile under any set of Trav design rules :) Ditzie
is filling out an order for a thousand ...

I certainly dont believe that you can make them with a 10 cm diameter,
especially with any sort of commo or sensor gear.

No they dont. If each shot has a 5% chance of a hit, then the odds are
enough PD batteries will get lucky early on to switch fire to help out the
unluckier batteries.

Completely agreed. If you are going to go for a contact missile, use the
Redneck Arms concept of the bucket full of Superdense ball bearings.

Have I said how much I like this concept for counter-missile missiles ?

Tax avoidance is the only reason to track money?  Governments could have all
sorts of reasons to track the flow of money, not to mention their secret
services own nefarious reasons.

The scenario in the "Big Brother" Doco (damn I wish I could remember which
country is/was using the barcoded notes -- anyone?) was a simple invasion of
privacy by the government.  Mr Average just wants to drop out (for whatever
reason it was), he takes money out of a bank in his home town, travels
somewhere, spends it and when the shop does it\'s end of day banking, the
cash from home, withdrawn from his account, identifies him as buying certain
goods (say it was a sports store?), then he goes further on and spends more
of the cash, and it repeats, etc., etc.

In Traveller, perhaps something illegal is afoot and an inordinate amount of
ICr\'s are turning up in System X from System K and there is no reason for
this to happen?  The powers that be would certainly like to know what\'s
going on, even if they only inform the local governments so they can check
it out... I don\'t know, why close your mind to ideas (for plot devices?),
use your imagination!

Outland is more "High Noon on Io" than anything else.  The lone lawman
making a stand for justice in a town gone bad.

The movie is good for stealing visuals and ideas from, but fairly
ridiculous.  It also suffers from the exploding people in vacuum syndrome.

You mean Brasilia, but otherwise your comments are dead on the money.
Brasilia is considered one of the worst capital cities in the world to live
in, because of its absurd over-reliance on the automobile, because the
planners had a pathetically poor understanding of urban social dynamics,
and because it wasn\'t designed to grow and evolve organically -- as all
cities do.

Australia uses polymer money that is supposedly counterfeit-proof (and I
haven\'t heard of anything on the news about it being done).  It is very
colourful to a degree, but even our paper money was coloured by
denomination.  However, it feels nothing like paper money, the early notes
($5.00 were the first plastics) could have the print rubbed off with your
fingers or washed off if left in your pocket in the wash!  These had been
fixed by the time they released the $10.00 notes.  What they never fixed
though, was that when folded, the newer the minting, the more "springy" the
notes are, and they sometimes have a tendency to "spring" out of the till or
from your hands!

ObTrav:  How "foldable" is Imperial credits?  Is the polymer they use as
plyable as paper or springy like plastics?  It\'s a pain when the notes
sometimes jumps out of your pocket by themselves!

From _High Guard_, 2d edition, page 33:

  _The Frozen Watch_:  ...Replacement personnel are kept available in
low berths for continuous replacement of casualties and battle losses;
between battles, the frozen watch can be revived and used to restore
lost crew.

The frozen watch is also discussed in Fire, Smurf^h^h^h^h^h Fusion, and
Steel, 2d edition, on page 77.

Note that these two sources have different formulae for calculating the
number of frozen crew required:

  HG2 - 50% of regular crew
  FF&S2 - total crew/total displacement/1000  [I suspect that this is an
error, and should actually read:  total crew/(total
displacement/1000).]  Otherwise, a 60,000 dton ST. LOUIS-class light
cruiser with 1627 crewbeings would require:

1627/60000/1000 =  2.71167 x 10^-5

Using my revised equation (which is employed in the spreadsheets on my
Web site, as a local bug fix), you get:

1627/(60000/1000) =  27.1167, rounded up to 28 crewsicles.

I usually employ at least five sets of frozen watch on my larger warship
designs.

Battle casualties, or casualties do to other reasons.  As such I\'d image
that the frozen watch would be found near the center of the vessel in one
of the more secure locations.

Now considering the hazards of low berths, this brings up the question of
how skilled at their jobs the Frozen Watch is.  One possibility could be
that every so often a different set of the crew becomes the Frozen Watch.
I would image that Senior Officers would be exempt from this.  I suspect
this is also mainly found on Warships (I don\'t remember if any large
civilian vessels carry a frozen watch).

If one uses the volume and mass of these devices to mount point-defense
lasers, the missiles are unlikely to get anywhere _near_ the engagement
envelope of such a system.  The effectiveness of PD fire is why, in T4
(and, AKAIK, TNE), missile systems generally employ
nuclear-detonation-pumped lasers (usually just referred to as
det-lasers).  (This has also, of course, been the subject of the current
resurgence of the missile thread.)

Generally no. It is GROTESQUELY inaccurate. RAM grenades are fired as per
normal and then receive a rocket boost midflight  at some point, so they are
definitely not recoilless

And there are no dumb questions.

All an explosion is, is just a *VERY* fast burn.

So, assuming from your .sig that you are the correct one, how do very

Do you have access to a copy of GT: Far Trader? I can give you a rule of
thumb for civilian shipyards, anyway.

From the draft of the upcoming GT: Starports:

"Shipyard Capacity

"Class IV and V starports have shipyards attached to them. The total
civilian shipyard capacity in dtons is equal to estimated annual trade
tonnage divided by 250. This is sufficient to cover annual maintenance
requirements, repairs, and replacement construction. In wartime (or other
emergencies), this capacity can be extended by 50% and used to accommodate
military vessels."

Annual trade tonnage depends on starport class, TL, trade classifications,
and proximity to suitable markets. Use GT: Far Trader (pp. 11-17) to
calculate the World Trade Number for the planet itself. Then use one of the
following methods to arrive at annual trade tonnage:

Method #1 (Most Accurate) -- Calculate the Bilateral Trade Number for every
world with which the planet trades, consult the table on p. FT16, and add
up all the tonnages. Don\'t forget to check for trade routes, and raise the
minimum traffic to the level specified on p. FT18; this represents
transient traffic passing through the system. The full analysis can take
quite a lot of time and effort, but if you\'re doing the work for some other
reason (naval budgets, commerce raiding, etc.) it might be worthwhile.

Method #2 (Quick and Dirty) -- Add 5 to the WTN and subtract the Distance
Modifier from the table on the top of p. FT15, using the distance to the
nearest star system, regardless of type. Again, if the world is on a trade
route (a pure GM call, in this case), raise the number to the minimum BTN
for the route (10 for a Main/Xboat Route, 9 for a Feeder Route, 8 for a
Minor Route/Jump-1 Main). Use this number and consult the table on p. FT16
to get total trade in dtons/year.

Ian Whitchurch has a different approximation he might be willing to share.

Naval shipyards are a separate issue, and one I haven\'t worked completely
out yet -- in part for the reasons you mention. CT says that naval bases
don\'t have their own shipyards: they contract with local firms (Supp 9:
Fighting Ships, p. 6). Hans Rancke-Madsen has pointed out that this doesn\'t
always make sense, and that the shipyard capacity addressed in TCS should
be separate from the ordinary civilian shipbuilding. But for now you can
take your military capacity from the civilian, plus 50% for running extra
shifts in wartime. Overtime (per TCS) is on top of this 50% increase.

Hope this helps -- write me offlist if you need help with the Far Trader bits.

[By the way, if anyone tries both methods, I could really use some feedback
on how closely they match. I\'ve tried a couple of data points, but not
enough to be really comfortable that the quick and dirty method is a good
approximation.]

Scotty :  "Computer?"
Mcoy sees mouse and hands it to him.  He brings it to his mouth like a

The business owner, miffed about this, then says, "Just use the keyboard".

 3.  Design the host platform, ship, boat, or vehicle to carry it.

Yeah, you believe that, and I\'ve got a Plankwell to sell you.

The Imperium doesn\'t get its power from the "free flow" of credits. It could
be argued that they get their power from the money they rake in. The money
they rake in comes from taxation. The taxes would largely come from the
gigantic megacorporations. It\'s a sweet deal on both sides.

It\'s in the Imperium\'s best interests to make sure that trade is as
efficient as possible. A simple method of tracking who buys what would be
*immensely* useful to, say, Ling-Standard and Delgado, among others.

Let\'s face it, there\'s no doubt that the study of psycho-history in the
Imperium actually *grew* from data that can only come from studying
amazingly huge populations and their trends. Which advertising campaigns are
most effective? Are certain campaigns more effective with younger folks?
Older folks? The bereaved and grief stricken?

This data can be gathered by surveys and the like, but ultimately there\'s a
margin of error. There is no margin of error if the naked statistics, and
not statistics about people from a small sample of a certain population, are
the ones that are gathered.

Possibly. Imperial tax evasion is not the only kind of tax evasion, however.
Evasion can occur on a planetary or even national scale.

It\'s possible, although if there\'s a system of quickly and effectively
tracking cash, than the anonymity angle is eliminated. At that point,
there\'s no reason to outlaw cash.

As described in GURPS Traveller certain technologies are available either

Vehicles 2nd ed. GT p107 gives a quick general rundown by technology.
Nuclear Dampers are GTL 12 devices in the Traveller setting, in conformance

In Traveller terms, your PDL laser needs to operate at short range minimum
which is 1 light second  (p75 Starships, T4), the next range bands are 2, 4
and 8 light seconds.

Light travels 300,000 km in a  second so your bus has to be beyond this to
be sure it is out of PDL fire. If you assume standard Traveller missiles,
they can burn 6G in a standard 20 min turn....

- ----
s=a (t^2) * 0.5

a = 6G = 60 ms-2
t = 20 * 60 = 1200 secs

Hence - distance covered in the first turn =

s1 = 60 (1200*1200) *0.5 = 43,200,000m = 43,200 km or 14.4% of the range band
- ----

Reversing the logic, we want the missile to hit in that single turn, so s
must be 300,000km

rearranging

s=a(t^2)*0.5

a = 2s / (t^2)

s = 300,000 km = 300,000,000 m
t = 1200 secs

hence a = (2*300000000) / (1200 * 1200) = 416.7 ms-2 = 41.7 G

So your missile needs to achieve a 42G burn for twenty minutes to hit in a
game turn. Assuming a PDL optimised for rapid fire ie ROF 800, the laser
will shoot every 1.5 seconds.

That\'s a 3 second window to change your position - but, you need to push
the G available up to evade successfully and achieve a hit if you want to
evade as well.

- ----
Now, the launcher is at least 300,000 km away. Against a civilian ship you
are generally okay, but with a military target you\'re probably already
under fire. Hence I think a bus solution is flawed.

Missiles become effective against civilian, or crippled targets (in the way
torpedoes were used to sink crippled ships in WW2), or when combined with
another attack which can overwhelm the target. Arguably, the Simbad Sam BB
KKM attack, if launched as a number of waves has attractions, but when you
start adding evasion and relative velocities from both target, controller
and launcher things get harder. Missiles will end up being used like those
used to ambush the Kafer fleet in the rings/asteroids by Borodin in 2300AD.
Powered down, stealthed, they also have a role, but Traveller lasers
currently knock out CT style (and 2300 style) missiles.

True, but it doesn\'t resolve the distance / acceleration / ROF issues.

Missiles have to penetrate sand in CT, MT... T4 was never defined AFAIK.

And then he manages to type a complex chemical formula into a program
he has never seen before on an OS he has never seen before on a computer
he has never seen before! A tribute to the ease of use of the Mac, or a
serious lapse in believability?

On the other hand, TL8 worlds regularly do business with TL15 worlds, so
the while Scotty lives in an exclusively TL15? world, 3I has figured out
some way to make computers like ours compatible with ones that you can
chat with: "No, no, no, Aleeza! I wanted invisible steel! This has an
extra carbon molecule. Over here. No, not that one! Yes, that\'s it!

Noticing that in the Real World, Lockheed Martin just jumped several points
in the stock market because they are selling 12 F-15s for several million
dollars, I wonder what kind of boom it is to the local economy When someone
says, "I need a new Free Trader." Of course, more free traders exist than
F-15s.

Sounds like a wizard idea to me.  And the machine can just keep track of which books got printed in order to send the \'publisher\' their share of royalties to split with the author...

In the immortal words of my wife:  "was this the *only* problem you had
with the movie?"

My favorite was parking a large spaceship in Golden Gate Park, and not
having a single jogger, frisbee player, or homeless person run into it.  SF
is a wee bit crowded, and the park is always full.  That and the image of
the crew *walking* from the Polo Fields all the way to 5th and Market.

From the Delphi version 2 CD case: "This package contains a complete
version of 32-bit Delphi for Windows 95 and Windows NT and a complete
16-bit version of Delphi for Windows 3.1 that can be installed on your hard
disk."

It doesn\'t list memory requirements, and I\'m not familiar enough with PCs
to know from the chip number. Will a 386 run Windows 95? (As I assume most
people will want a Windows 95 application.)

C\'mon, we\'re talking about Micro$oft bloatware here.  For Win95, you
need at _least_ a fast 486; I would recommend at least a Pentium-class
processor.  [ObTrav: For _optimal_ performance, I would suggest a Model
6fib or better....]

OTOH, a quite serviceable Celeron 366 MHz or faster (with 128k of
integrated L2 cache) can be had for US $500 or so, with an extra
$250-$300 or so for a 17" monitor.  That\'s about half the price of an
iMac....

Where does it say that? My copy of CSC says a TL12 black box with Ship\'s
Boat 6 (the lowest that can be built at that tech level) costs about Cr10
(yes, ten credits) and weighs 100 grams. At higher tech levels the cost and
size is nil and they could be included as free prizes in cereal boxes.

Now, CSC also charges an exorbitant MCr0.1 per m^3 for an "autopilot" in
vehicles, but presumably this is for sensors, actuators, and control
systems. It\'s curious that cargo and passenger space require just as much
autopilot as engines and weaponry. In any case, FF&S doesn\'t require any
extra hardware for computer control of spacecraft; presumably they are
already run by computers and the crew is just there to operate the machines.

For comparison, a single crew station and half a stateroom costs over Cr100
000 and 2 dtons. Add salaries and the notorious Cr2000 per trip for live
crew and you\'d conclude only someone who wants to go broke in as unsafe a
ship as possible would use any human crew.

If you think the autopilot price is too high you could just replace the
crew with reprogramed "companion" robots. While the purchase cost of KCr250
and annual contract of KCr25 per year are greater than the fixed cost for
human crew, the operating costs are lower. You could probably reduce the
contract price by doing your own maintenance. Losing that pilot will save
you about KCr100 per year in salary and life support alone. If you can sell
the ex-pilot\'s cabin for middle passage you\'ll gain about KCr192 per year.
Replacing your crew with robots can save you millions. All this is at TL12;
robots get cheaper and better at higher TLs.

Why does a cargo ship need to *dock* at a berth?  Much better to do
it out in space where you have room to work.

The line cargo ship transports cargo on standard grav-pallets.  The
ship pulls into it\'s assigned "archorage" near the Highport where it
waits for the arrival of fuelers and tugs.  When they arrive (could
be waiting on the ship with proper planning) the ship opens all its
cargo hatches and "floats" the cargo pallets out to the waiting tugs
(lighters).  The tugs grab the pallets and tow them to the
Highport\'s storage areas.  Meanwhile the fuelers start pumping fuel
into the cargo ship.  Next, incoming cargo is towed over by tugs for
"roll in" to the ship, which closes its hatches, finishes refueling,
waits for clearance (both of the tugs and fuelers and the Highport\'s
tower) then boosts for the jump point.

Even better, design the ship with fore and aft "float on/float off"
in mind.  Cargo is floated on through the large fore hatch as cargo
is being floated out through the large aft hatch.  The cargo would
have to be organized into a queue, but that would work on routes
with regular cargo loadouts.

Of course, *none* of this works for ships doing spec trade or
dealing with spot cargo markets...like PC ships.  ;-> They have to
spend time in port selling merchandise, then and finding, buying,
and loading more.  They don\'t always have regular routes and will
almost never have regular cargo loadouts.  So, the PC ship sits in
port for several days...while the PC\'s get a chance to have an
adventure. ;->

Standard HG/CT lasers can be used in point defense against missiles
already. TNE and Briilliant Lances just offered a more detailed laser
design sequence where you could tailor a short range, high ROF weapon to
operate in a PD role.

So PDLs are just weapons with a USP rating slanted towards the short ranges
and high ROFs.

Even against visible-light lasers, mirrored armour probably won\'t be very
effective. The basic problem is (a) no mirror is perfect - so a mirrored
coating
will absorb (say) 1% of the heat incident on it, and (b) mirrors are fragile;
it takes very little absorbed energy to turn them into something blackened and
no longer reflective. So if a 100 Mj 1 milisecond laser pulse hits a surface,
in the first ten microseconds the square cm of mirror coating that is getting
hit
absorbs (100 Mj/milisecond)*(10 microseconds)*(1%)=10 kilojoules,
which is certainly enough to blacken the mirror; now that it\'s black, for the
remaining 990 microseconds it absorbs the full pulse.

High ROF lasers will probably be electrical, not chemical.

It\'s pretty easy to stabalize the beam; you don\'t have to hold the whole
laser assembly still, just one small steering mirror. Arrange things so that
your boresight sensor is looking along the same steering mirror and close a
control loop to hold the target still on the steering mirror; and hence
the laser is held still on the target. This is how modern astronomical
adaptive
optics work; a modern AO system can track targets to a fraction of a
microradian.

The distance a missile offsets from its predicted flight path goes as
1/2 * acceleration * timelag^2, where timelag = 2*range/c. At 1000 km, this is
0.011 m. (The time^2 really kills you at short ranges.) No
problem for the PDL.

You can make arguments about time to detect missiles (although if a missile
can hide at 1000km, starships will never see each other - sensor signatures
go up as (range^2), and a missile that\'s running its powerplant enough to
accelerate at 50G is much brighter per ton than a starship...) and about
crew reflexes, or slew rates (although a good laser should be able to slew
tens of degrees per second and acquire new targets in less than a second),
but in the end, what dominates is that Lasers Don\'t Miss at short ranges;
it\'s very hard to swamp a well-designed point defence system with a direct
impact missile. This is a Good Thing, because if you do the math, the kinetic
energy of these high-speed missiles is close to the yield of a nuke; direct
kinetic energy missile hits should completely trash small spacecraft, which
most
of us don\'t want.

d=at^2. (d=at doesn\'t even have the right units...)

The t^2 means that evasion gets worse as the square of the range, which
is why targes are incredibly easy to hit at 1000-km ranges but very hard
at real starship ranges of hundreds of thousands of km.

In FFS2, this is the sort of thing that advanced IR masking buys you.
It only works up to a point...eventually even IR emission from the body of
the missile is detectable. So you refrigerate the body of the missile...
but that gives you more heat to pump out. And you have to paint the
missile black (otheweise it\'s easy to detect from reflected starlight...)
And, in the end, the missile probably can\'t hide from active sensors.
Since active sensor detection goes as range^4, a radar that can
detect a 100-ton ship at 100,000km can detect a 0.1 ton missile
at 10,000km rather easily...

What always amuses me in these missile debates is that the people who
think they\'re defending Traveller canon by wanting ways to have impact
missiles end up wanting to have missiles that are undetectable and maneuver
at 50G...which gives it enough kinetic energy to destroy a warship in a
single hit. So you\'ve designed a weapon that can surprise and destroy
small combat ships with no defence whatsoever; not very Travellerish
to me...

It isn\'t so much that there are specific special rules, so much as that
various of us noticed that with FFS2 rules you can easily build a laser with
a ROF of several pulses per second, enough damage to kill a standard
missile, and a range of 10,000 km - and that with reasonable arguments about
physics, such a laser should hit missiles 100% of the time at ranges below a
few thousand km.

Similarly, FFS/BL\'s sensor rules are a little weak;since there\'s no range
band below "short" your big PEMS-8 sensor\'s chance of detecting things
doens\'t go up at ranges below 8. In "reality", a sensor should have a
signal hundreds of times higher at a range of a ten thousand km than at
240,000 km. The Definitive Sensor Rules (available various web sites) for
FFS2 do a better job of calulating detection probabilities.

One approach would be to take this discussion to the trav-tech list (assuming
it\'s still active - I haven\'t seen any messages in a while.) Or private email;
you give me your missile\'s performance data and I\'ll calculate the range at
which a sensor can see it and a laser can hit it.

(My qualifications? I\'m a professional astronomer at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, working on infrared instrumentation, adaptive optics,
and laser guide stars, which is why I know a little about sensor sensitivities
and laser and tracking capabilities...)

Not really.  The key term is "copying" and it is often confused.

If I take my oil paint set, sit down and in front of the Mona Lisa,
and paint a perfect replica, stroke for stroke, then I have \'copied\'
in common parlance, but NOT for copyright?

How can this be?

Copyright protects an author\'s right to reproduce his own
_original_ work of authorship.  (author/artist are interchangeable,
"author" is used in the US Copyright statutes).  So thats
one work with reproductions.

When I make a perfect replica, but its my hand that guides
the brush, its _my_ work.  I am the mover of the brush,
the author, the artist.  I have not \'reproduced\' the work
of the oringinal author in any mechanical fashion.  I pushed
the paint brush.  So whatever I produce is mine.  And I
own the copyright for it.

If I had taken a taken the Mona Lisa and photocopied it,
or photographed just the painting, and then produced copies
of DaVinci\'s work, then I would be \'copying\' in the terms of
copyright law.  And I would be infringing Da Vinci\'s right to
copy his own work.  That is the copying that is illegal.
If I do it myself, even though it may be a perfect match
for the original, it is NOT a "copy."

(Ignore for the moment the fact that his copyright in the Mona
Lisa has expired).

So, ob trav., if I create (and I am) my own Spinward Marches
map, as long as I do the drawing myself, I am not infringing the
copyright of whoever may have published a previous map.
Particularly fatal to the argument that I might be \'copying\'
is the fact that I can produce a map of my own from just
the raw statistcal information of the sectors and UWPs.
In fact, any map generated from the same data may appear
identical.

There is no copyright problem in anyone creating their own
map of the Spinward Marches.

BUT!

Trademark issues should not be ignored.  Trademark and
copyright are DIFFERENT!  People, lawyers and judges
confuse them all the time, but they are Separate schemes
that protect intellectual property.

Trademark serves to protect the goodwill that the creator/purveyor
of a good/service creates in his product/service.  It direct purpose
is to prevent confusion in the mind of the consumer as to the
source of the good/servive.  When you the consumer by a
Tukera ship, you expect a ship produced by Tukera, not by
Oberlindes.

When trademark issues are most often discussed, the subject
is the "mark."  This is usually a word or image unique (within the
particular market). [Aside: The first trademark was for Bass beer and
consists of the red triangle.  If you try to market a beer with a
red triangle on the label, or otherwise incorporated into the good,
you would be violating Bass\' trademark.  No question about it.]

However, the concept of "trade dress" may also serve as a source
identifier for consumers.  This can apply to particular aspects of
any good (usually not applicable to services) such as the shape
of a bottle, the smell, the color, etc.  If you created a new RPG
and published in in small LBB-size books, with black backgrounds,
and colored borders at top and bottom with a thin colored line in
the middle, calling it "Layabout", while its clear that you\'re not
calling it Traveller, or using a Traveller official (i.e, registered) trademark,
there is a very good case that you would be violating Traveller\'s
_trade dress_, because the appearane of the good is likely to cause
confusion to the consumer.  Even though it says lay about, it looks
like a Traveller LBB.

Back to map issue:
"Spinward Marches" _could_ be protected trade dress of Far Future\'s
Enterprises.  (IMHO, its a tough case, but its one not to be fought).
The actual of the image, well, I\'d bet the house that it wouldn\'t
qualify for trade dress protection.  You\'d have to prove that the
visual pattern of dots within hexes that represents the Spinward Marches
is so unique and well-defined within the RPG market, that anyone
seeing the same arrangement of dots and hexes would automatically
conclude that it was an officially sponsored "Traveller" product.
(If I was being paid to argue the other side, I could generate a lot
of arguments to support the position that the map itself would
qualify for trade dress protection, but it would be mostly hot air
and incredibly difficult and expensive to prove because survey
data would need to be taken - and trust me, you don\'t want to
have to pay for that.).

The more aspects, such as size, font, color, etc., that you mimic,
the more likely to get into a trade dress issue you are.  I could make
a map that looks exactly like the SM map in Darrians AM, or
in GT: BtC.  There is a plausible arguement that if I did so, even if
I placed every pixel myself, that the totality of what I was doing
was violating the trade dress of either FFE or SJG respectively.
Why?  The "look and feel" of everything together may be so similar
that it would confuse consumers.  (What you may have heard about
"look and feel" in Windows vs. Apple law cases were copyright fights,
not trademark, IIRC.  Different context here anyway).  I would certainly
make this argument if I represented either company and <ego> I\'m
damned sure I would win the issue, if not at trial, then on appeal </ego>.

So, if you\'re still with me, what does all that mean?

GET PERMISSION for anything you distribute in the Traveller/GT field.

Though "Its better to get forgiveness than permission" may be reasonable
advice in some aspects of life, use this principle in the intellectual
property field, and you will pay.  Often, not just the damages you cause,
but TRIPLE the damages, because the government wants that kind of
behavior punished severely!

When I finish my Spinward Marches map, Marc Miller and Loren Wiseman
will be the first to know.  Until its finished, its not worth bothering them (in
case
they\'re reading).  Anything that happens after that will be will permission, or
it will be carefully redesigned not to infringe any trademark (copyrights not
being
an issue).

I hope this helps anyone\'s understanding of Copyright and Trademark issues.

The Frozen Watch has always been an interesting idea.
Who gets this duty?  I suspect volunteers, though a regular
rotational cycle might also exist.  Surely, there will be variations
in how different fleets use the FW, but here\'s the FW I want:

The ideal FW person is simulataneously the most highly skilled,
combat-tested veteran and the worst officer or NCO in the Navy.
These people are great at accomplishing the mission, no matter
what it is.  But they make their own rules.  Sort of like Fire and
Forget missiles.  Thaw \'em out, tell \'em whats up, and get the hell
out of the way!

They may have severe emotional problems.  Probably, in fact.
They may be hard-core headstrong bigots who only like to fight.
They may have lost everything in their life that was valuable to them.
They may have given up all hope of ever being ordinary.
They may be your only hope of survival.
They may well want to be frozen and woken for the thrill and
adrenalin rush of crises.
They may make the rest of the crew pee themselves.

Thats the frozen watch I want on my ship.

I have copies of notes using base codes G, H & N from HWIG dated 1994. G &

Assumign that my kids aren\'t leading me up the garden path, a hybrid CD can
be read by both Mac and PC. I was advocating putting the data in both the
original format, and a cross-platform format. (The original format to allow
easier changing, if that\'s what the user wanted, and assuming that the
author didn\'t mind.)

In the case of those MacDraw files, a 300 DPI GIF takes up a lot more space
than the MacDraw file, and wouldn\'t allow the user to do things like change
colours for objects, fill backgrounds, and so forth.

Ditto, but even more so, for my Shadows plans, which take up over 10 times
the space at 300 dpi GIF as they do in the original SuperPaint, and still
don\'t look as good.

A hybrid CD would allow the inclusion of both PC and Mac software, too.

Wrong Albany.  To shoot with Mark Cook, you\'d have to participate in a
Pacific Northwest-TMLer roadtrip (which, IIRC, has been discussed).

(1) Safety and convenience (which really mean: money). Away from the port,
all the work would have to be done in vacuum and zero-g. The skill of the
stevedores is therefore limited by the lower of their Freight Handling,
Vacc Suit, or Free Fall skill, which will either slow down the process,
cost more money for expertise, or increase the number of accidents (or all
three).

(2) Time (which really means: money). In order to operate such a system,
you\'d have to cross-load every cargo twice: once from the ship to the
lighter, and once from the lighter to the port (or vice versa). This takes
either time or an considerable number of lighters and crews, either of
which costs money. This, by the way, is why all modern ports are designed
to load to and from berths: lighters take too long. They are normally
restricted to situations where the ship or the cargo (e.g. power plant
turbines) in question is too large for the port facilities, as sometimes
happens in the Third World.

(3) Money (which really means: money). The grav pallets you propose would
work, but their cost is not negligible, especially since you have to let
them sit almost all the time for no return on your investment. The logical
extension of this concept is the LASH freighter, where the cargo stays
aboard the lighter and the lighter itself is loaded as cargo. This *is* a
profitable alternative, but only just, because you have to balance the
economies of speed against some very specific flight profiles and the cost
of having 50% more lighters than you really need.

That is not to say that your method isn\'t the right answer above a certain
size ship. Thanks, Eris -- now I\'ll have to figure out where the tradeoff
is. The 2/3 power relationship still applies: no way around it without more
specifics on hull configuration than GT (at least) provides. Maybe
dispersed hulls? Hmmm...

I agree with this statement, but I would put it a little differently.
There is NO general ship contractor and NO assembly facilities.  That
means that if you want to build a ship on a world with a Class C or
lower starport then you will have to be the general contractor yourself
and go out and find and negotiate with ALL of the subcontractors.  The
subcontractors will not be experts ship systems and will have to charge
more to cover training for thier personnel and for modifying thier scale
of manufacture.  Also you will have to provide a place for assembly
along with all tools needed for assembly.  Class A and B starports
already have the facilities and general contractor with the knowledge of
experienced subcontractors.

As an example: In the Dallas/Fort Worth Area, We do not have a port
facility or ship building but I Could find everyone needed to design and
build an aircraft carrier, but I could probibily get 4-6 for same price
in Newport News VA. (not to mention the cost of getting the thing to
water)

Anyway, I think the point is that if someone in the Traveller community has
an old 486DX or Pentium machine that\'s doing nothing much, and is willing
to donate it, Rob will port his excellent software. Considering I\'ve seen
old 486\'s <200 GBP *new*...

So if anyone is in an IT department which is scrapping the old P1s or 486s
to upgrade to NT4 Service pack 4 for Y2k issues, please think of Rob if you
can get hold of one for next to nada.

\'Two ships which have matched courses are considered to be at boarding

1 hex is 300,000 km (1 light second)

I know what you mean - I like CT missiles, and the KKM/2300 det laser
developments but unless you reign in laser technology in Traveller they
don\'t work against a military target.

How hard would lasers have to be reigned in to make the game work as CT?
Would it just become 2300 Star Cruiser?

Well, the US Military drew theirs from the Intell personnel, at least for

The canon imperium is a very slow tech progression. TL 10-12 in Y0, TL
10-15 in 1050, Barely pushing TL 16 in a few coordination centers in 1116.

Megacorp sttability is based upon commanding a market share everywhere they
can. If you can reduce innovation, you reduce corporate need for in-house
innovation (whihch, if you can maintain desire, you can keep artificially
high... and hopefully outdo the gov\'t...). Realistically, the setting needs
some limiting factors on tech growth.

I do like this criteria Bloo, it jells with so many things I imagine.  Now
I\'d like to know, how long can troopies be kept in FW?  Is there a physical
limit ("If we don\'t thaw them out by tomorrow, they are unrecoverable,
Doctor!") or legal limits ("By statute 175.45 of the code, these troops have
been frozen for six days past their time.  This Captain, is a serious
breach...!").

I\'d think there would be an upper limit.  Imagine being in FW for 10-years
say, and when you awaken, all your buddies have changed greatly, family have
died, your children don\'t know you, laws have been changed, you missed the
last two Star Wars sequels, your favourite TV show has been cancelled, etc.

By your logic, then, I could sit down at my word processor and
type up a perfect replica of Marc Miller\'s latest rulebook for
the latest version of Traveller, or the text of the latest 
best-seller from Tom Clancy -- since it is my hands that worked
the word processor, what I produced is mine, therefore the 
copyright is mine. 

I don\'t think so.

What you have produced above with your paint strokes is commonly
known as a "forgery".

(Since I have no idea if your example was a serious illustration
of your view of the copyright law or a facetious example of how
someone else\'s interpretation is wrong, I am unable to draw any
further conclusions.)

This is a hypothetical example with now real life validity, as you can\'t
reproduce a picture \'stroke for stroke\' (IRL) as you wouln\'t have the exact
fluidity of movement of the artist etc... (Nor could an artist produce an
*exact* replica of their own work...each act in it\'s production being a
unique event)

Also, Leonardo\'s copyright in the Mona Lisa expired about 400 years ago...

However, the copyright of photographs of the picture etc, reside with the
photographer or the organisation the photographer was working for etc.

Agreed, as the text *is* an exact replica of the original (even if you use a
different font), unlike the picture.  The issue here is the copyright of the
*Idea* rather than the final product.

It\'s only a forgery if you try to pass it off as the original...

otherwise its a \'reproduction\' (or Collectors  Limited Edition, or whatever
you want to call it etc <g>)

Right.  The civilized way to get a starship would be to buy one from the
Class A port down the main.   But a pocket emperor, or an \'ethically
challenged freelance commerce raider\' might not have that option.

Years ago I designed (using HG) a million ton Battleship, which (among other
things) carried about a *Division* of Frozen Ships Troops.  Under the HG
rules I think about a Battalion of which (in rough numbers) were doomed to
die on being thawed out....posthumous gallantry awards for each of course
<g>.

Bzzzt!  Wrong answer.  The law makes no distinctions among methods of
copying.  A copy is a copy, whether it was produced mechanically or by 
hand.

It doesn\'t even have to be a perfect copy. One porno magazine was 
successfully sued by another for duplicating one of their photographs, 
even though it was a different picture... similar setting, similar 
props, similar outfits, similar pose, different girls. It was ruled a 
violation of copyright because it was obviously a *derivative work*... 
their photograph was intentionally made to look like the competitor\'s 
photograph.

Unfortunately, this is incorrect.  The map is FarFuture\'s intellectual 
property and cannot be duplicated, by *any* means, without their 
permission.  If you can legally copy it without permission for personal 
use, then you can copy it without permission for resale... which would 
defeat the point of copyright in the first place; to protect the 
original creator\'s interest in the work.  If you are able to duplicate 
his work exactly and sell it just because you didn\'t use mechanical 
means to do so, there would be no point to copyright because there is no 
difference in the end result between your publication and the orignal.

The creation of a map from textual data is an interesting point... the 
data is still the creation of FarFutures, regardless of its 
presentation.  You couldn\'t take an alphabetized list of systems 
published by FarFutures and publish your own list sorted by star 
types... it\'s still the same data.  The map is similar... it\'s still the 
same data, just presented differently.  I won\'t say it\'s illegal, but 
I\'m tempted to say that a court case would get ruled that way.

No, you expect a ship *sold* by Tukera, not necessarily produced by 
them.  The point is to keep other companies from stealing your customers

I figure that any _regulatory_ limit on continuous FW service would be
based on medical considerations.  The other concerns (pertaining to the
universe changing around the crewsicle) may actually be a selling point
for FW volunteer service.  In addition, the likely financial incentive
(base pay, plus hazardous duty pay) would help gain volunteers for FW
duty.  However, I would expect that most FW personnel woud serve maybe
one of every four years in the freezer, with the rest of a service term
spent either in retraining or on active duty.

One possible game mechanic for post-CT character generation (or CT
variants that assume that failing the survival role repersents early
discharge, rather than early mortality) would be to allow players to opt
for FW duty during each term.    Any character who, during a term that
includes FW time, fails a survival rool by 2 or more (in a normally
non-lethal character generation system) actually _does_ shuffle off this
mortal coil (start over!).  However, for each term that includes FW
time, the character gets an extra mustering-out roll (on either table),
with a +2 DM on the Cash table, and a +1 on the Benefits table.  The
additional roll(s) for volunteering for FW duty can allow a character to
exceed the usual limit of three rolls on the Cash table while mustering
out.  This simulates both the additional money that a crewsicle can
save, and the additional honor and glory that comes from volunteering
for such hazardous duty.  Of course, this benefit only applies to
military personnel (Army, Marines, and Navy), since paramilitary and
civilian organizations are unlikely to carry a frozen watch.

Each term that a character serves FW duty subtracts one year from the
character\'s physical age (I assume that FW personnel spend one year out
of a term in the freezer).  No penalty would be taken for skills gained,
as the service in question would probably provide catch-up training for
recently-revived FW personnel.  Further, promotion would be unaffected,
as penalties on promotion would be a disincentive for crewbeings to
volunteer for FW duty.  (This also models the premise that those who
might otherwise be passed over for promotion, due to unsuitability for
peacetime service [despite being well-suited for combat duties], would
volunteer for FW duty to retain their standing on the promotion lists.)

OK, I defer to you on this.  Technically, the oxygen bound in the nitrate
is an "oxidizer", but it is insufficient to completely combust gun powder
without additional O2 from available air.

That is just plain *wrong*.  An explosion (or detonation) is very
different from combustion (or deflagration) of gun powder, both
chemically and physically.

Energetic materials are divided into 3 distinct classes: explosives,
propellants, and pyrotechnics.  All three are exothermic redox reactions,
and are self-sustaining after initiation.  The energy released by explosives
and propellants is comparable, but the physical process is very different.

Propellant burning, or deflagration, is very rapid even combustion that
begins on the surface of the propellant and proceeds into the grain (or
other solid body.)

Explosive combustion, or detonation, involves a supersonic shockwave
(never present in a deflagrating body) moving through the explosive
material, causing spontaneous decompostion of that material.  Explosive
velocities vary, but are typically within the range of from 2,000 to
9,000 meters/sec.  By definition, this process is *NOT* "burning".

BTW, I\'m citing TM 9-1300-214 ("Military Explosives") and FM 5-250
("Explosives and Demolitions").  Thus, as you can see, the U.S. Army
and Marine Corps agree with me, or visa versa.

That, I can\'t answer, other that sheer speculation.  In the current
U.S. arsenal, approved explosives undergo no less than 21 suitability
tests (sensitivity to impact, electrostatic shock, detonation test,
cook-off temp. friction, SUSAN test, gap test, flying plate test,
etc.) and approved propellants undergo 23 similar tests.  Both explosives
and propellants undergo heated vacuum tests (explosives at ~150 deg.
C. and propellants at ~90 deg. C.).  However, those tests are primarily
to determine storages degradation and not reduction of energetic
release.

FYI, the bulk of these tests are done by the U.S. Army at Picatinny
Arsenal and the remainder are generally performed by the U.S. Bureau
of Mines.

I assume you mean Boston, MA, right?  My club is just outside of
Albany, *Oregon*, not Albany, New York.  FYI, New York is a very
unfriendly state, from a firearms standpoint.  Mass. to Or. would
be a hell of a roadtrip!

Be that as it may, you\'re more that welcome to come out and shoot
with me.  Heck, I extend this invite the the entire TML.  Come to
Oregon and shoot a submachine gun!  Just bring your own 9mm factory
ammo and I\'ll provide the rest!  Jesse DeGraaf roadtripped all the
way up here last month for a big 2 day full-auto shoot we held,
and judging from the ear-to-ear grin he constantly had glued to
his face, I think he had a fairly good time.  (Jess, wanna offer up
any testimony?) :^)

  We had noticed the ROF fire thing and were designing a Laser with a high
ROF (400 pulses) when we noticed that the rules say that the ROF only gives
a DIF MOD to the to hit roll. We were under the impression from others on
the list that one PDL could take out several missiles in one turn. That was
why we are wondering if we have missed something in the rules or have read
them wrong.

  BTW Windows crashed while I was putting this up and lost about 2 hours of
typing (at 2-3 words a minute). I had put up the Missile and PDL design
that we had made but now I don\'t have the time to re type it in.

  We are having trouble figuring some of the values. And I thought making
ships in Space Opera was hard. Heck FF&S makes those rules look like
child\'s play.

Or imagine all your buddies are dead.
Your family is dead.
Your homeworld is a burning husk.
Everyone you touch seems to die.
You have some unwanted knack for survival, but it won\'t protect

You don\'t want to kill yourself, but you don\'t want to make new friends

You misunderstand.  Perhaps my visual graphic metaphor is
confusing to apply to written works.

A word is a word, no matter how typed, formatted, rendered, etc.
Use my words, violate my copyright.  There is no "original" (a magic
word necessary for copyright to exist) way to write a letter, legally
speaking.  This is why fonts get no intellectual property protection.

Working a word processor is also not "authorship" as defined in
the copyright act.

No.  It would be a forgery and/or counterfeit, if I asserted that my
work was the original artist/authors.  I used this example because it
was, or at least used to be a common way of teaching painting.

My example was accurate.  Perhaps confusing in the writing context.
I was attempting to be brief and avoiding particular doctrines that
are primarily relevant to the written medium, such as the "Fair Use"
doctrine, library and archiving privileges (in US law), etc.

Photography often involves some tricky doctrines and envelope pushing
of US copyright law.  Lots of gray areas.  What you say is generally acurrate.
But if I took a picture of just a person\'s painting, with no originality added
to (and what might qualify is definitely a gray area), and then distributed
the photograph, or copies of it, its possible that I would be violating the
copyright of the painting\'s author.  While the impact of photography
and what are the minimal elements are academically interesting, they\'re
not really suited for the TML.

Dangerous language.  Only Patent protects ideas. Copyright protects expressions:

"original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium (however impermanent)."

Ob. Trav.  Vilani Patents are more comprehensive than US patents and subsume
accepted ideas of copyright.

Not quite.
You\'re using the ordinary lay definition of copy. If my hand moves the brush, its
my "original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium".  It is not the original
painter\'s work.  (Potentially, but its might conceiveably be a derivative work).

If I mechanically reproduce another authors work, by definition, I have
not added any orginality or authorship to the end product.  So, what
I\'ve done can\'t qualify for copyright independently.  However, if I do
add sufficient originality and authorship to the end work, then that
end work independently receives copyright protection.  (Note, the
concepts of derivative works, and trademark issues easily begin to
confuse the issue at this point, and I\'m consciously avoidinging discussing
them as that conversation isn\'t valuble to TML.).  Andy Warhol
added enough originality and authorship to his Campbell soup cans.
Lichtenstein did the same with many of his works.

A "copy" (layman\'s definition) is not a "copy" (legal definition) when its
an "original work of authorship" (also legal terms of art).

Therefore, not original enough to qualify for copyright.
[As I mentioned in a separate post, photography issues
add siginificant confusion to the discussion of these issues,
to say nothing of digital medium.  Not to mention the fact
that it is clear that a great many, if not most, federal judges
that are often called upon to deal with these issues, do not
understand them adequately and make mistakes that are
not addressed by subsequent appeals of the parties.  I can\'t
name more than three judges I would trust to decide these
issues accurately.]

Selling, publishing, distributing the hand copied Mona Lisa from my original
post, is problematic on a whole host of other legal grounds (misrepresentation,
trademark, etc).  But the definitional issue is distinct.

If you have that cite, I\'d appreciate it.

Define the map.  The answer/legality of my actions (hypothetically
without consent) vary greatly based on the definition of the work.
(I contend that I would win the legal issue either way based on
the originality requirement, but that discussion isn\'t for the TML).

Incorrect statement of law (at least as it applies to US Copyright law.
The Fair Use Doctrine:

" . . . [T]he fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction
in copies . . . for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
(including multiple copies for classroom use, scholarship, or research, is not an
infringement of copyright.  In determining whether the use made of a work in any
articular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include ----
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the
copyrighted work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work."

Selling it complicates the issue, greatly.  I intentionally avoided
the details of this issue.   The act of distribution implicates
other doctrines of intellectual property.  In many ways, its the poor
language of certain portions of the US copyright laws combined
with the trademark laws, that are responsible for the frequent
confusion of these issues.  If you confuse them, you\'re in the
good company of most of the US Supreme Court.

Data is not protected, generally speaking.  Certain types of
databases do qualify for protection, based upon the originality
of the database based on the collection of the information.
There is a recent database protection act, the details of which
I am unfamiliar with.  But, in general, the only real protection
for a database is its security/secrecy.

Creation alone doesn\'t qualify for protection of anything.
Never has.  Never will.  Even if unique to yourself.
For copyright, it must be (1) original, (2) your own work
of authorship, and (3) fixed in a tangible medium.

Correct, but for a different reason.  Sorting by stars wouldn\'t be
original.

> The map is similar... it\'s still the same data, just presented differently.I won\'t say
> it\'s illegal, but I\'m tempted to say that a court case would get ruled that way.

Well, the US courts are sometimes categorically wrong on these issues.
Perhaps even often wrong.  So that has no value, academically speaking.

You\'re missing your best argument, even though its still too weak, IMO,
to win the legal issue:  a pictoral map that I create, based on the textual
descriptions of the Spinward Marches sector in, could potentially
be a derivative work.  To my knowledge, there is no case law to
support this, so the foundation is non-existant, but it might carry in
appelate court. But, fair use doctrine is going to cut you off at the knees.
Why?  The published fair use factors in a nutshell:
 - recreational purpose,
 - non-profit,
 - different nature (graphical, not textual)
 - small portion (only the text portion of the work the data is in that details
the aspects depicted in the map - vacuum, gas giant, navy/scout base, x-boat route,
sector, name) and not a substantial part of the whole book this data appears in
[The whole of the original work is the measuring stick]
 - zero effect on the potential market for the original work

[From my \'Medicine In Traveller\' series, based on an article which
appeared in \'Traveller\'s Digest\' way back when..]:-
Long-term Considerations 
1. Hibernation :- 
Fast berthing 60:1 slowing of metabolism. 
Chill berthing 600:1 slowing of metabolism. 

Hydration is required to permit long-term hibernation. 
The maximum safe period of time without fluid replacement is three 
days (so 180 days with fast berthing or 1800 days with chill 
berthing). 
Beyond this, 2D damage per day (60 or 600 days) until treatment or 
death ensues. 

With hydration :- 
Starvation : rapid weight loss (1kg/d for first ten days then 
0.3kg/d thereafter). 
- -1 from Str and Dex every two days until zero. Then -1 from End 
every week until death or feeding ensues. 
Multiply this by 60 or 600 depending on the hibernation type. 

With IV (or gastric) feeding :- 
Roll catastrophe check every year (infection at IV site, disconnection
and bleed, etc.) 

2. Vitrification <---- frozen watch are more likely to be \'corpsicles\'
rather than \'iceberg lettuce\'...
1 point of damage is sustained for every 25 continuous years spent 
\'on ice\'.

If you\'re going to a con this summer, why not run a Traveller demo? If you
do, or you want to promote Traveller, print off some copies of this Acrobat

That\'s correct, but I\'m not certain that the Mac section can be seen by the
PC and vice versa. Not really an issue unless you have either both types of
platform, or you end up with say 300 Mb of data duplicated on both sides.

I\'ll dig out my Toast manual and see what it says about readability....

it\'s not clear but the manual does say \'you want to write discs that can be
read on a Mac and a PC, with the Mac data only visible to the Mac Users,
and the ISO data only visible to other users.\' From what I remember from
disks like Riven and Myth II which are dual format, you can only see the
part whic corresponds to your OS...

Anyone know better

This is a good point. Under the current rules, each turret could only act
against one missile attack in a turn (although under the description of the
technology it should be able to hit multiple targets). This may just be
game balance, or the impact of the certain death by laser radius hadn\'t
been considered. Bear in mind T4 doesn\'t have a working combat system
(unless you count Bruce\'s MCS or RPSCSv0.9).

Ouch! You have my sympathy - only way around that it regular saves and
hoping it doesn\'t trash the original file. There is another way actually
(which I took); use a Mac ;-)

Andy Akins has a very good Excel 5 spreadsheet for FFS design. (On the webring)
Andrew Moffatt-Valance has a similar one for T4 FS2 guns (this is at

The Akins spreadsheet for Excel 5.0 is also available on my Web site
(see my sig for the URL; follow the link to my ship design page).

I mention this not only to plug my Web site (and my ship designs), but
also to point out that I have found and fixed two bugs in the original
spreadsheet:

1.  The original spreadsheet made an error in calculating power
consumption by grav compensators.  (I have notified Andrew Akins of this
bug; it should be corrected in future versions.)

2.  While the original spreadsheet used the FF&S2 formula for
calculating frozen watch crew requirements, I found that the numbers
from that formula were off by a factor of 10^6 (see the "Frozen Watch"
thread for details).  I therefore plugged my modified formula into the
spreadsheet.

You will also find a link to the Traveller Gearhead Ring on my site.

Your hand moving the brush is not a creative effort... it is a 
mechanical one.  The creative effort comes from your mind, and all your 
mind did was attempt to copy a painting.  The key word above is 
"original" and your painting is not.

Your reproduction of a painting adds no originality.

I don\'t see where the law differentiates between types of copies.  A 
copy is a copy is a copy.

>Therefore, not original enough to qualify for copyright.

And your copy of a painting is? I don\'t see the difference. The second 
photographer went through a great deal of effort to design the set, 
choose a costume, pose his model, take his photographs... yet it was 
declared to be an infringement on the first photographer\'s rights to his 
work.  How is it you think that by applying the paint to canvas with a 
brush involves a creative effort that was not present in the second 
photograph?

>If you have that cite, I\'d appreciate it.

I\'ll look for it.  I believe that at least one of the parties was one of 
the major men\'s magazines, if you\'d like to search for it.  (Just 
explain it to your wife *before* you start searching for names of men\'s 
magazines. :)

The map is the work presented on page 23.  It is a graphical 
representation of the data presented on page 22.  I think your only 
argument for lack of copyright of the work is the nature of the data, 
but I contend that the data is of a creative nature and subject to 
copyright.

Outside of Fair Use and trademark issues, sale doesn\'t complicate it at 
all... copyright violation occurs whether you sell it or not if you 
didn\'t have the copyright holder\'s permission and your copy does not 
fall under the Fair Use clause.

Surprisingly, it\'s not as protected as folks generally think. Look for 
Feist Communications of Wichita, KS vs some dinky Kansas phone company, 
concerning the outright copying of their phone book. Until this case, 
the courts had always ruled in favor of "sweat of my brow" defendants... 
they did all the work to compile the data, so they owned it. In this 
case, the court ruled that the white pages of a phone book contained no 
creative effort and no creative arrangement, so anybody could copy the 
contents.

The sticky point of Traveller system data is that it wasn\'t 
*collected*... it was *created*. Producing the data was a creative 
effort. And a map reflecting the data is simply another way of 
presenting it.

Which is why you can\'t copy the Mona Lisa (were it still protected by 
copyright)... because your work isn\'t *original*.  You copied it, even 
if the medium required painstaking effort to reproduce it.  As I said, 
the law makes no distinctions as to the *methods* of reproduction.

>Well, the US courts are sometimes categorically wrong on these issues.
>Perhaps even often wrong.  So that has no value, academically speaking.

Unfortunately... whatever the courts say is *right* until they change 
their minds. The courts interpret the law. Their opinions, even if they 
change them later, are the only ones that count.

Ya know... this really doesn\'t resemble what I recall as being Fair Use. 
In fact, it doesn\'t really jive with the excerpt you posted earlier in 
your message.

I see no mention of "recreational purpose" in the Fair Use law.

"...for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching..."

And about that "non-profit"... the whole phrase is "non-profit 
educational purposes".  Where\'s the "educational" part of your copying.

"Different nature"... the law doesn\'t say that it must be of a different 
nature... the law says that you must consider "the nature of the 
copyrighted work". Not the nature of mediums of the copy vs the 
original.

"Zero effect"... it doesn\'t have zero effect if you\'re copying it out of 
a friends book to avoid buying a copy for yourself.  If you\'re copying 
it out of a book that you already own and you aren\'t giving the copies 
to anyone else, then it does have zero effect.

And as I see it, since you\'ve copied it to play a game and not to 
criticize, comment, report or teach, it doesn\'t fall under Fair Use.

Here\'s an interesting case that I believe is still pending... 
photographer takes picture of very cool pyramidal building in the 
sunset. He sells posters. Architect sues for copyright infringement, 
because the visual image of his building is his intellectual 
property... the point of the poster wasn\'t a skyline, but that specific 
building (which is the only one in the shot, if I recall). The posters 
would not have sold with just any old building... and these posters 
limit the architect\'s ability to sell his own images of the building. 
(Of which there are none, so there\'s no prior "poster copyright" to 
violate.)

But I want an iMac, not a PC.

The original post was, essentially, me pointing out that I\'d only convert
the software if someone donated me a PC as a development platform, and then
a brief amplification of the required system performance.

BTW, the neocons got back in. This has negative impact on my Traveller time...

And here we have a perfect real-world example for copyright. IIRC, Steve
Daniels and Eris are lawyers, so hopefully they can explain the legal
position.

All of these were taken from work that I created. My original GIFs were in
colour (and still show as colour in my GIF viewer, although Netscape shows
then as B&W.  My copyright notices, included as part of the Get Info window
for the files, seem to have been stripped off.

Regina is based on the map published by DGP. I colourized it and added a
couple of very minor details.  I was granted permission to do this, and to
distribute my version of the map, by Joe Fugate, who then owned DGP. The
current owner, Roger Sanger, has not rescinded this permission. (Nor has he
paid me the money DGP owes me for the Sydkai article and several equipment
sheets, but that\'s a separate issue.)

Dinom, Victoria, Pysadi, and Fulacin are based on maps published by GDW. I
colourized them and made some minor mods. Loren gave me permission to
distribute them free-of-charge, although the obligatory copyright and
permission notices seem to have been stripped off (probably when converting
the file from Mac to Windows).

Echiste and Risek are my own designs. Again, the copyright notices are missing.


The copyright notice for the modified maps read:

This drawing  Robert Prior, 19nn, based on a map  Game Designers
Workshop, 19nn. Used with permission.

(At least, this is what Loren asked me to include at the time. Joe wanted
the same thing with the DGP map.)

My own maps should have a copyright notice for just myself.



So the legal questions are:

1) Who actually owns the copyright to these works?

2) What should the copyright notice say?


This is not a trivial question, as I am trying to sell an article on
Echiste to Pyramid and I don\'t want it rejected because part of it has
previously appeared on the Internet. Ditto for Risek. And I suspect that
the rights to the GDW maps reverted to Marc, who will probably have his own
opinion. (Knowing Marc, he\'ll probably be OK with the drawing being
available, as long as the notice is correct, but he should be asked first.)

Paul, I\'d appreciate it if you\'d pull the Echiste and Risek maps until I
hear back from Scott Harding about my submissions. (Hopefully soon, as he\'s
had them for several months now.)  If Pyramid wants the articles, I\'ll
suggest that they get you to do the maps.

It isn\'t in the rules as such, but neither are kinetic energy or HE or
nuclear impact missiles. The history is that in the post-FFS era, on the
old gdw-beta list, various people kept complaining (like you) about the
absence of impact missiles...and designing uber-impact-missiles that would
cripple destroyers in a single hit, and writing rules for them. So in
response, various others wrote rules for point defence and did the appropriate
calculations on rates of fire, hit probabilities, etc. (Very little of this is
archived, unfortunately.) So neither the missiles you want to use nor the
lasers
we want to use are in the rules; it just comes down to math and physics.
(The math being that a laser is effectively guaranteed to hit a missile within
a few thousand km, the physics being that if a missile can score a hit it
does a *lot* of damage.)

In the end, I don\'t think the TNE situation - if you add either fragmentation
("BB") missiles or chemical laser missiles - ends up that different in
*effect*
from CT/HG; there are civilian missiles that do a little damage, and military
missiles (nuke det-lasers) that do moderate damage, but no Giant Death
Missiles
as you would otherwise end up with if you allowed kinetic energy impact
missiles.

(I should mention in passing that the reason that KKMs turn into Giant Death
Missiles is mostly Traveller\'s reactionless drives - T-plates don\'t conserve
energy, so missiles end up with much more kinetic energy than they really
should; or HEPlaR, which is so efficient that it\'s like having an atomic bomb
going off behind your missile - a missile ends up with as much kinetic
energy as a fusion bomb would have.)

  I was thinking that under a house rule you could allow that instead of

a minor change to the ROF chart on page #130 of the FF&S book. (Look below)

  *Standard note for Laser area size due to fire rate.
 **You may choose to fire at multiple targets up to the number rated for
the current ROF of the weapon instead of gaining the benefits of the
Difficulty Modifiers. If weapon is targeted at less then the max number of
targets you may modify the Diff mod of one or more targets by the
difference. As an Example. If your Laser array has a ROF of 400 pulses and
you target only two targets you have the choice of -1 diff on each target
or a -2 diff on one target. Also all targets targeted by the Laser have to
be within 20 degrees of each other from the focal point of the Laser array.
(i.e. if targets are 1 hex away all targets have to be in the same hex at

  Well the races (or Ethnic groups) that use these don\'t have reaction less
drives (No one does) and only two of them have any kind of Gravitics
technology. So they have to make due with other types of tech (I.E. Soviet
vs Nato).

Traveller GM/Players do, since the Traveller story line isn\'t the most
stable (IOW consistent) since they switched to MT (then TNE and T4 and then

In any case, your stats are correct except that Dojodo is also an Ic world on account of its

I\'d meant to do this earlier, but kept forgetting, postponing, etc....

I do believe that road trip (except the solo driving of course) was the most
fun I\'ve ever had with my clothes on.  For everyone else on the list, the
event that I drove from California to Oregon for was the "Albany Rifle and
Pistol Club Annual Spring Full Auto Shoot".  Mark was kind enough to invite
me after some thread earlier this year where I mentioned that I shoot a lot.
The ARPC SFAS is run by Mark, who is the full auto director of the club.
The event was absolutely outstanding.  I\'m not sure exactly how many owners
(of NFA devices) were there, but I\'d hazard it was pushing 100 or more.  The
overall attendance was over 300 spectators/day IIRC.  Some people have
likened this event to the Knob Creek of the West.  It\'s actually better than
that because you\'re guarenteed to be able to shoot if you so desire.  There
were two rental "businesses" there (for lack of a better term) wherein you
could rent one of their weapons for a magazine\'s/belt\'s worth of ammo.  One
of their employees would stand with you while you were on the firing line.
One of the two businesses had a ton of classic full auto weapons, while the
other had all of the modern, state of the art stuff.  This one is the one
that I rented the HK G36K from.  Oh mama, what a sweet piece of hardware
that is!!!  However, at $10 for 30 rounds of fun, I only shot that once.
The rest of the time I was shooting all of Mark\'s toys while he was busy
running the show.  I practically had unlimited access to his weapons since
he and his wife Lori were busy with making sure the event ran smoothly.  Too
bad I didn\'t have more ammo.  I\'d only had enough ready funds to bring half
a case (500rnds) of 9mm, and another 500 rounds split between .308 and .223.
I could easily have shot two to three times that!!

I\'d like to take this opportunity to publically thank Mark and Lori Cook for
their wonderous hospitality and generosity while I was up there.  I had a
truly wonderful time and I DEFINATELY plan on being there next year.  Just
gotta\' bring more ammo :)  I whole-heartedly recommend to all the TML\'ers
out there that you make every effort to attend next year\'s shoot, or the one
in December.  If you live within 13-15hrs driving time of Oregon, I EXPECT
you to be there :)

Best,
Jesse

I ran the numbers for freighters dedicated to each type of cargo, as well as the
general case at both GTL10 and GTL12. These are the "optimal" sizes I calculated
(all ships very similar in design to previous post).

Figures in Brackets are (Profitability, first year ROI, Break-even Load)

GTL10 Freighters (optimal m drive around 0.57 G) :

Mixed Load  - 2500 DT (P 54%, ROI 19%, B/E 65%)
Liquid Bulk - 4000 DT (P 58%, ROI 21%, B/E 63%)
Dry Bulk    - 4000 DT (P 56%, ROI 20%, B/E 64%)
Mixed Load  - 2500 DT (P 54%, ROI 19%, B/E 65%)
Container   - 2500 DT (P 52%, ROI 19%, B/E 66%)
RO/RO       - 2000 DT (P 49%, ROI 17%, B/E 77%)
Break Bulk  - 1000 DT (P 33%, ROI 12%, B/E 75%) 

 
GTL12 Freighters (optimal m drive around 1.0 G):

Liquid Bulk - 4000 DT (P 73%, ROI 27%, B/E 59%)
Dry Bulk    - 3500 DT (P 71%, ROI 26%, B/E 59%)
Mixed Load  - 2500 DT (P 69%, ROI 25%, B/E 59%)
Container   - 2000 DT (P 66%, ROI 24%, B/E 60%)
RO/RO       - 1500 DT (P 63%, ROI 23%, B/E 61%)
Break Bulk  - 1000 DT (P 47%, ROI 17%, B/E 68%) 


These figures all assume standard Cargo density, 95% loading, 400 Cr/DT/PC, &
exclude loss premium.

Well...

I have tried Ships that split in two so that it can occupy two berths at once
and unload/load twice as fast (i.e. a 2000 DT main ship & a self contained
driveless 1000 DT cargo hold).  This proved marginally less profitable, but an
interesting design, that could be made to work, and would save money during
trade lows.

I have tried having a ship that splits into a J-drive section and a non-jump
cargo section.  The J-drive section separates on entry to the system and drives
for the next jump point. The cargo section goes down to the high port, unloads &
loads, and then reconnects to the j-drive section at the jump exit point.  The
benefit is that the j-drive section only needs a very small maneuver drive, so
the cargo section is faster, for the same investment.  This works out at very
similar profit levels to a standard ship.

Taking this one stage further, on a dedicated trade route between two planets,
there exists a very profitable possibility.  You buy one jump section (the most
expensive bit) and three cargo sections. At any time you have one cargo section
at the planet at each end of the route, and one in jump. The ship exits jump at
a predefined rendezvous point. The j-section and inbound cargo section detach.
The j-section then docks with the waiting outbound cargo section and then jumps
back.  The j-section therefore only spends a few hours in system, and you are
getting the maximum use of the most expensive part your investment - the
j-drive. Each cargo section has a smaller m-drive than a standard ship, as it
only has to get from jump point to high port and back before the j-section
returns, in a minimum of 13 days.
I can get up to nearly 50 jumps a year using this method, and ROI increases by
at least half.
Am I allowed to do this? I can\'t find a minimum time between jumps in GT.

I keep trying, I will find a way...


Passenger Liners (coming soon):  I have just started on passenger liners. I see
that there will be problems with passenger rates.  These are very profitable
indeed, even at low utilization levels. Do you have any suggestions to cap these
at a reasonable level?

Jump Masking - I notice that using the figures from "First In" that jump masking
time will reduce significantly over the FT figures (based on "Scouts"). Are
there any plans to update them?

Designer\'s Notes:

This ship design is, we freely admit, a brutally minimaxed effort to
manipulate the fixed rates for passenger and freight traffic.  By using
small staterooms for middle passage, the gross income is just under Cr
4000 per displacement ton of passenger space.  Even subtracting the Cr
2000 for life support, plus the requirement for galley, food storage,
and baggage space, that still leaves nearly Cr 3000 per dton.  This is
50% greater than the default value for speculative trade. Additionally,
since staterooms require much less mass per dton, the F21-2 requires
smaller thruster and CG drives than most ships of its size.  Smaller
maneuver drives allow a smaller power plant, both of which allow for a
less-expensive vessel.  These factors make the F21-2 profitable, using
standard T4 assumptions, even when operated at only 50% capacity.  At
80% capacity, the F21-2 can make an annual profit sufficient to pay off
the down payment in approximately two standard years.

By concentrating on the middle passage traffic, a line operating these
ships can fill a market niche similar to coach-only airlines on modern
Terra.  While passengers travel in less comfort than high passage
allows, middle passengers have two incentives to travel on such ships: 
while the stateroom is small, it _is_ private; and there is no
possibility of a high passenger bumping a middle passenger off the
manifest at the last minute.

AuricTech Shipyards has [IMTU], as of 1103 IE, contracted to sell 20 of
these ships to Thermopylae Lines, a cargo and passenger line operating
primarily in the Vilis subsector of the Spinward Marches.

[IMTU note:  Thermopylae Lines was founded by my main PC\'s wife, who, as
noted in previous posts, came into obscene amounts of money under, shall
we say, "interesting" circumstances.]

The economic facts in the Traveller universe can only be accepted if you
assume that chronic crises of underdevelopment are possible in capitalist
economies. If everything worked in the pollyanna ^k^k^k^k^k^k accepted
manner of \'conventional\' neoclassical economics, then the Traveller
universe just wouldnt have kept it\'s radical mix of hi- and lo-tech worlds
over hundreds of years. Development would happen, because developed
economies are just so much more profitable.

Not neccessarily.

To simplify things, imagine that these 2 worlds - one TL11 and one TL15 -
are the only shipyards around. TL11 jump-2 freighters arent too bad
compared to TL15 jump-2 freighters, but TL11 warships really suck when
compared to TL15 warships.

Therefore, it makes sense for the TL11 world to build all the freighters,
and do a lot of fetching and carrying for the TL15 world. In return, they
get a small number of TL15 warships, which still gets them more defense
capability than by building their own warships. The TL15 economy builds
warships for both worlds, and invests in more bleeding-edge research
(seeing how it doesnt have to dedicate any resources to all that fetching
and carrying).

>(such as TL-11 starship yards on pop 6 planets in the same subsector as

The first thing that saves TL11 shipyards is that it may not be that much
cheaper to build radically lower-tech goods in a high-tech world. Hi-tech
workers presumably get paid more, for a start, and higher tech worlds may
have emission limits and such for heavy industry like building starships. I
am also not convinced that you could build radically lower-tech goods than
a world supports - does the infrastructure exist to work Crystaliron when
then entire economy has moved over to Superdense, for example. Similarly,
would the engineers and technicians be able to buld the primitive fusion
plants ? I think what would happen is similar to the motorised dhows that
ply the short haul routes in the Indian ocean - the hi-tech economies build
the outboard motors and maybe the GPS systems, while the rest are built at
the lo-tech local economies.

The other thing that saves the TL11 world\'s economy is exchange rates. A
low-tech world will trade a lot of stuff it can make for a small amount of
really, really neat hi-tech goods. If the high-tech world can use the TL11
stuff, then letting their lo-tech needs be met by the lo-tech world will
let them specialise in what they are good at - bleeding edge stuff.

Note that this will have big, big impacts on just about everything. A
TL11/GT10 freighter should be a small percentage of \'sticker cost\', if paid
for in very hard Imperial Credits (which can of course be used to buy
TL15/GT10 goods). This will in turn drive freight rates down, if freighters
get paid in hard Imperial credits.

The way I handle this in my campaign (which is set in District 268) is to
say that \'book\' prices for GT 10 goods are correct, but to double prices
for GT11 goods and triple them for GT 12 goods.

To my knowledge, we never went into this in GT Far Trader. If you want to
put exchange rates into it, assume \'standard\' jump 2/3 freight is paid for
in TL10 credits, but that \'express\' freight is paid for in GT 11 credits
(ie costs about 80% more).

We would need to build some GT9 freighters, to determine if a GT9 jump-1
freighter can compete with GT10 jump-2 and -3 freighters, if it gets a cost
advantage of 40% due to being bought with \'soft\' GT9 credits.

I\'ll also reprint from an old post of mine about trade from lo-tech to
hi-tech worlds.

You have two excellent target markets on hi-tech worlds for lo-tech goods.
The first is the fashion market - with good enough marketing, the lo-tech
can be sold as a plus. Phrases like \'hand-made\', \'primitive\' and \'genuine\'
should be generously splattered around the brochures. Sure, the modern
equivalent is cheaper, lighter, more effective and doesnt get
creepy-crawlies living in it, but hell, since when has mere efficiency
mattered in fashion ?

The second market is the bleeding-heart market. The example I\'m thinking of
is Nicaraguan coffee during the Sandanista years. Nicaragua grows coffee -
it\'s decent but not great. It was marketed thru left-leaning orginisations
and such, with the not subtle subtext being \'Buy the Coffee to Support the
Revolution\'. I\'m sure people can think of other examples - the idea of
trade-as-aid has kicked around for a while. It isnt a big market, but if
you are selling to Trin, it doesnt have to be ...

Note that the first strategy will help prevent development in the long
term. A world that has carved a niche for itself may be locked into it - if
your sales pitched is based around lo-tech, then you *cannot* develop
without abandoning this niche.

Note that most real-world commerical shipping is built in less advanced

A good rule would be that most civilian ships will be fair game for any missiles of the three types. Against military ship of the third line or better you will have to use large numbers of each of the three missile types to saturate the PD of the target ship. To improve the chances of over load other weapon types should also be used like lasers, particle beams, and meson weapons. All weapons should be timed to get there at the same time zone so to speak.

Nice to see my missiles are still remembered.<G>

Hmm maybe I will try and see what can be done with GURPS vehicles to make a payload missile with Reactionless/exhaustless drives.

I lied. There are some bugs that I have corrected, but are _not_ posted to
the website. They are:

Fixed a problem with backup passive sensor costs.
Fixed the power use of grav compensators.
Fixed a volume problem with life support in the Excel Version (it was
including fuel).
Fixed Power Plant scaling error.

Plus, there are some new features in the works
Added multiple TL ability to all weapon systems
Added Brilliant Lances format USP
Added Battle Rider format USP

The last three items are about 75% percent done...but I got sidetracked
(work, school, and a short bout of chemotherapy - but I\'m better now, thank
you...).

Do people want me to post a new version with the bug fixes, but the feautres

Fundamental procedure for putting Vp (Velocity of pulse)=C weapons on a
target at ranges where potential movement exceeds target size and Beam
duration exceeds maximum movement:

Base intercept time Ti= (2xDt)+ Tc +Tb
	Where Dt is distance measured in Light Seconds
		Tc is computational time in seconds
		Tb is time to bring weapons to bear
Max variation (probability area) radius Rp = (A x Ti^2)/2
Saturation Area As: Pi * Rp^2
Min Cross-Sectional Area Approximation Amcs: X x Y
	Where x and Y are the two lowest of Lenght, Width, and height
Simultaneous shots required to assure a hit Sss: As / Amcs

When you start getting more potential movement than beam duration, you
start getting into multiple saturation PLANES, each the with a depth in LS
equalling the pulse duration. You have to put the pulse into the target.
Also, this fails to account for even penetrating; that is a 3d problem,
which, if I recall my math right, works something like this (assume all
linear measurements to be in meters unless specified otherwise):

Effective Shot Volume Vse=Amcs * Db * C
	Where Db = Duration of Beam Pulse in Seconds
		and C = ~300,000,000 m (I KNOW I\'m rounding...)
Volume to be saturated Vs= Pi * Rp^3
	(I\'m not certain if I remembered the volume of a sphere... but it is
	a sphere, since all potential accellerations from the head of a known
	base vector are spheres, unless you have to factor in time to rotate
	to apply accelleration... correction here requested)
shots to saturate Ss= Vs/Esv
	High rof weapons may be able to count multiple times, depending
upon recycle time and As per wave.

 Mind you, this is the base for getting assurance of a single beam
intercept, as well, and doesn\'t account for the additional factors of
Rotational time of the target to apply thrust (which makes it easier, since
the target gets less time for max thrust, but does result in an ovoid
solid... like an egg with the narrow end pointing along the starting
vector), nor does it account for the potential of increased or reduced Ti
for initial vector...

Essentially, a Higher ROF allows more shots into the MOST PROBABLE path...
except in high saturation or extremely close ranges. CT Canon Missiles are
10cm by 1m tubes,, so we can assume that the real cross-sectional surface
area is somewhere around (75 to 300)cm^2. At close ranges, a single missile
is going to be USELESS against anything with more than a few lasers... but
waves might be effective. As for kinetic projectiles (unguided), it works
much the same, except that the Ti formula is nastier:

Base intercept time Ti= (2 * Dt)+ Tc +Tb + (Dt * Sp/C)
	where Sp/C = Speed (in unit of choice) divided by Speed of light in
	same units.
and the "Length of pulse" is measured in centimeters, simplifying the
Effective pulse volume formula to:
Effective Shot Volume Vse= greater of (Amcs * Lp) or (Vp)
	where Lp = Lenght of Projectile
	and Vp is volume of projectile... (seldom used- target must be smaller
	in effective cross section than the projectile....)

Realistically, a point defense useage of lasers is questionable past  a
couple BL hexes (0.1 LS, IIRC), but then so is being able to do damage with
a laser at those same ranges (hence the gravitic focussing "fudge").
Kinetic Kill systems are likewise extremely limited, and none of the above
even includes any factoring for penetrating, or even having sufficient
energy to do damage. At extremely close ranges (<=0.2 LS, bearing time and
calulation times become more important. I\'m willing to grant TL10+
Traveller computers calculation times on the order of 1 millisecond...) but
bearing times will probably be on the order of a minimum of 0.1 second.

Let\'s figure a weapon with a Beam duration of 0.05 seconds, and a missile
(CT canon sized) with 6g discretionary burn, at 0.1 LS, and a bearing time
of 0.2 seconds, and a Type S as the target (one laser in the turret); thus
a 2d problem. We will assume a recharge time on the laser of same 0.2
seconds.

Ti= 2 * 0.1 + (0.001 [note 1]) + 0.2 = 0.3 seconds
Rp= (0.3^2 * (6g * 10mpss[note 2]))/2 = (0.09 * 60)/2 = 5.4/2 = 2.7m
As= Pi 2.7^2 = 3.1416 * 7.29 = 22.502264
Amcs= 0.1*0.1 = 0.01
Sss=22.5/0.01 = 2250 shots

Note 1: dropped due to insignificance in the rest of the problem.
note 2: 10 mps is a canon figure, not a real world one, and is used for
convinience, too.

To be honest, I can\'t remember the formulae for ovoid solids nor elipses...
so I\'ll stop here. But, suffice it to say that a kinetic projectile
intercept requires high velocities, large targets, and fairly close ranges
(on a space scale).

Some dual platforms are using a 3 partition method:
partition A: MS-Dos (for application, Docs, and DLL\'s)
partition B: MacOS (application, docs, extensions, cdevs, and libraries)
partition C: ISO-9660 or other mutually readable, otherwise hidden
partitions for the actual run-time bulk data.

Macs can read some MS-Dos CD-Roms for data files; specifics vary. I know,
cause I\'ve done so. With the right extension, one can even look through an
APPLE II Prodos CD.

 Ok Here is the Missile (I hope it reads alright)
Ok this is too the best of me and my friends understanding of how the FF&S
rules work, so don\'t laugh to much if we have very blatant and obvious
mistakes. BTW of our group, none of us have any education higher then HS
(Unless you count Military Tech School) and I have the best Math background
which is I took Algebra 2 (And barely passed) so don\'t reference stuff we
wouldn\'t have access to unless it is in use in the real military. (I was a
Offensive Avionics Specialist, another player was a Defensive Avionics
Specialist, and the other was a Weapons Specialist i.e. he repaired and
maintained Nukes) Were not Engineers by any means, but we do like a good
rousing space combat with lots of big explosions. :)

MK VIII Heavy Missile Shadow 
TL:14
Warhead: Nuclear 100 kt Yield.                          Mass:   72kg
Propulsion: EAPlaC SF Rocket 4 x 599kg (400 tns trust)   Mass: 2386kg
Guidance: Seeker (Image Recognition)                    Mass: 1000kg
Sensors: Passive EMS 60K range  Proc Vol:0.4             Mass:  800kg 
         Ant Diam: 5m Ant Area: 0.6 m2 Ant Vol: 0.03     Mass:   30kg
ECM: EMM    Vol: 1.40 m3  Rad: 0.7 m2                    Mass:  700kg
Average Mass:       3.795 tons
G Rating:   400 / 3.795 = 105.4
Fuel Consumption:  11.25 m3 per hour (this is where we have probs)
Fuel Endurance:   2.386 / 11.25 = 0.212
G Turns:  105.4 x 0.212 = 22.3 (round to 22)
Max Gs per Turn: 22

  This missile was built by the Solarian League in response to the Advanced
Sensors the Imperialists developed in the Later part of the Reformation
War.  This missile is a redesign of the MK VII Stealth Missile, but is much
larger because of the better ECM and larger Engines. This missile typically
used in Tandem with its New sister Missile MK III Heavy DTL Stinger .
The MK III has a Nuclear Pumped Laser Warhead, roughly 5 times the Yield of
the MK VIII. The MK III is nearly the same size and with the same
ECM/Sensor package. These two Missile use there Masking technology to
appear Identical to opposing Sensors.
  The Shadow Missile and its sister Stinger are Stand off missiles for
use in long range strikes or Prolonged Assaults. With there low Sensor
Profile it enables them to approach a target while being undetected till
there is little time for the Target to respond. And with the Preprogrammed
Target Identification Algorithms they will select try to select the most
Tactically valuable target.


  Ok what do you guys think? We don\'t know how much this thing costs but
we have figured in the 2-3 Mega Credit range. Kind of expensive, but the
rich Solarian\'s which also Value lives (Only there own of course) above
money try to use stand off weapons as much as possible.

  Note: IMTU I have based it upon some of my Short Stories I have written
in the past. I am now changing one slightly to show an example of these in
(at least what I envision) use.

Oh here is the stats for the other missile


 MK VIII Heavy Missile Shadow 
TL:14
Warhead: 500 kt Pumped X-Ray. Vol: 0.358 m3               Mass:  358kg
Propulsion: EAPlaC SF Rocket 4 x 528kg (400 tns trust)    Mass: 2112kg
Guidance: Seeker (Image Recognition)                     Mass: 1000kg
Sensors: Passive EMS 60K range  Proc Vol:0.4              Mass:  800kg 
         Ant Diam: 5m Ant Area: 0.6 m2 Ant Vol: 0.03      Mass:   30kg
ECM: EMM    Vol: 1.40 m3  Rad: 0.7 m2                     Mass:  700kg
Average Mass:       3.944 tons
G Rating:   400 / 3.944 = 101.41
Fuel Consumption:  11.25 m3 per hour 
Fuel Endurance:   2.112 / 11.25 = 0.188
G Turns:  101.41 x 0.188 = 19.06 (round to 19)
Max Gs per Turn: 19

  As you\'ll notice nether missile would fit on either a Turret or Barbette,
but you could fit 4 in a 50 ton bay and 9 in a 100 bay, at least that is
what we have guessed by glancing at the rules. We haven\'t got so far as to
designing launchers for these.

Reminds me of an episode of the Simpsons. Homer and Marge are coming out of
The Empire Strikes Back, and there\'s this *huge* line waiting to get in. He
turns to Marge and says "Wow. Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker\'s father." In a
single frame all of the disinterested people in line turn angrily toward
poor Homer...

  Just don\'t allow the Gravitic Lenses for lasers. That\'s what has allowed
Lasers to be able to attack at such great distances.

  Possibly right, but at 10,000, 20,000 or even 60,0000 it could be too
late (by the BL rules as far as I understand them). If I can get a regular
12/12 missile on the right vector to where it gets within 6 hexes of your
ship before you detect it, then I can easily get within the your hex to
either hit you (Which is actually hard *not Impossible* to do) or let off a
Det-Laser with little to no chance of missing. Your ship would only have
that single turn to try and destroy the missile, and if that can draw some
of your Laser shots from my ship so I can get within range of my BFG, then
I\'d feel that they have accomplished the job.

 BTW does the person who wrote the FF&S book frequent this list? I got a
couple of rules questions.

  Well what if, a race didn\'t have the Tech (or the will) to make awesome
accurate long ranged lasers, but had really good tech in stealth and
missiles? And they also had a inhibition to loosing there own peoples life
(Religious) but didn\'t care how many of the enemy they killed, they would
make stand off weapons. Det Lasers are a good one, but so are regular
missiles.

 My favorite tactic was to piss the target off let him lock on me then I
would accelerate away from him then spin around and just hurl lots of shots
in his direction (sort a what a pulse laser does) and I would usually get a
few hits because he is trying to lock on me, and when he did I would have
to change vectors or be destroyed by his shots coming (But many light
seconds away)

  BTW how does you all explain visual bolts to players? Or do you? I have
told players that they can\'t see the lasers with plain eyes, but that the
computers project the beams or pulses onto the screen so they can see them.
Also why aren\'t MFD\'s Multi Function Displays? :)

  Huh? Too many numbers. My head hurts. :)
 So your saying that this is why all 800 have to go on one target, or that
you can hit 800 targets with one laser?

 So this means that you need more shots to hit a target that is moving

 I was wondering, If I had a missile already going on a vector with a
heading 2 and a velocity of 8. Then when the missile locks on to target at
4 hexes on heading 3 and has 12 left for thrusting and uses all 12 to
increase its velocity and change its heading in that same turn [4 thrust to
change heading and 8 to increase velocity to 16] how many seconds would the
target ship have to fire lasers at the missile? This is of course assuming
the Target ship hasn\'t detected the missile till it had gotten to a range
of 4 hexes. I know by the BL rules the ship has a whole 30 minute turn, but
I would think the missile would get there in a shorter time.

 So what I was wondering, does anyone know the Displacement Value for these

  Constellation class Heavy Cruiser (Same as the 1701 Enterprise)
  Romulan War bird
  Klingon D7 Cruiser (Battle cruiser from the Original series)

  The players are going to happen upon the battle where the Federation
Heavy Cruiser "Hood" is ambushed by Klingon\'s and destroyed. But I am going
to add a little twist. 2 Romulan war birds will have also warped in to join
in the fray.

  I have breezed over the Alternate technologies sections in the FF&S book
and saw the references to the other tech that are very similar to the
Impulse drives and Warp drives of the ST universe. And the player that
suggested it also said maybe that this time they might make it back with
something that works. (He still doesn\'t know me too well :))

Having not followed the progress of Traveller the last couple of years

For example:
What was behind the Black Curtain? (Is that its correct name?!?)
How did he view the RC developing in the games timeline?

Just Wondering

DOH! They build those TL6 freighters, and we\'re building those bleeding edge
TL8 nuclear attack submarines...only we\'re not selling any.

Thanks Ian, you\'ve made it clearer to me. Was that currency rate stuff built
into FT? I should pick it up, then. Having local credits trade variable to the
Imperial based on TL makes a big difference.

The point being that it isn\'t the oxygen per se which makes like a blow

I thought you were about to make the same mistake that they had on
Babylon 5 where they were worried about igniting the atmosphere of
Jupiter, whereas enny fule noes that you can happily strike matches in a
100% methane atmosphere (just look at the lightning on Jupiter...)

Those are the rules.  However, AS A PLOT DEVICE, I allow two exceptions:

1.  On a late TL8 world, Professor Frink is using prototype TL 9 technology
to build a scout ship in his back yard to explore the universe.  Yes, it\'s a
big back yard.  No, I don\'t know how he\'s paying for it, maybe he got a
grant.

2.  On a TL 9 world with a Class B starport, Der Fuhrer has decided he wants
a star navy NOW.  No one will sell him any starships (smart people), and he
doesn\'t want to wait 30 years for a Class A port can be built (dictators can
be like that).  "Where there\'s a whip there\'s a way" is an integral part of
the totalitarian philosophy, so his Minister of Armaments improvises.

You might very well have systems like we see in communications
protocols, where an advanced newer technology has several earlier
more standard technologies included.  The local
OS/hardware/protocol/etc might run faster, be smaller, whatever, but
when interfacing with systems that don\'t match the local standard
the system "falls back" on the slower/larger/less efficient, but
universally compatible IDP tech.  You can innovate, but if you want
wide acceptance your innovations must include the standard "fall
back" standards.

Eris
>>>> (end qouted material)
This looks just right to me.  It definitely follows general practice
today.  For example, current modems (something I am familiar with) are
v.90 (56000kbps) compatible if they are intended for standard phone
lines.  If they are worth anything, they will also be capable of dealing
with quite a list of older protocols.  A specific example (I have the
box handy):  A Zoom fax modem VFX v.32bis modem handles the following
standards:  for 300bps:  Bell 103, v.21, v.22 A/B, v.23.  for 1200bps: 
Bell 212A, v.22.  for 2400bps:  v.22bis.  for 9600/4800bps:  v.32.  for
14400/12000/7200bps:  v.32bis.
As you can see, for a modem that can run at 14400bps (yes, that USED to
be a fast modem), we have 10 different protocols that the modem can deal
with.  Another example is the US Robotics modems, which have come out
with a number of offbeat protocols over the years trying to beat out the
competition.  USR modems will still talk to other USR modems in the HST
protocol if you set it up properly.  The HST protocol is a USR only
protocol that they brought out when 2400bps was the standard, and the
HST protocol would allow transmissions at 9600bps.  The HST protocol
never caught on with other companies.
Ob Trav:  I agree with Eris that there would be a series of standard
protocols that equipment would follow, even if the high end was
different or completely new.  I would suspect that there would be at
least 3 protocols in the IDP for each tech level (early, middle, late),
and perhaps as many as 20 or 30.  If we assume 3 per TL starting at 9,
then the 1120 IDP would have at least 21 protocols to deal with. 
Someone in a particular field (say skill of 3 or so) would probably be
able to rattle off each of the names on the spur of the moment.

Well there are 3 things you need to build starships:

1. A class A starport
2. A population to build them
3. Lanthanum

Assuming you have all 3 of these then you\'d rate output based on an
algorithum based on economic power (population) in dtons. One has already
been posted. (Popn/1000), I had my own which was (popn/120,000) based on
the Imperium/ Dark Nebula apparent building rates (1 turn must of equalled
4 years, during which a large developed world made 1/3rd of a CruRon (Major
world = 4 Resource Units, a CR Sqn costing 12RUs). Assuming 10,000 ton
cruisers and 10 ship squadrons thats 8333 dtons/ year on a world above 1
billion people, although both capitals had considerably higher rates, hence
larger populations)

My original classic traveller also gives build rates between 100 and 5000
dtons (9 months for a 100 ton scout, 36 months for a 5000 ton light
cruiser). The rate was going up at 1 month per extra 1000 tons so a 10,000
ton cruiser takes 41 months on the slip, the origin of the 4 year Imp/ DN
etc. turn rate. (Cruisers were built in 1 turn, Battleships in 2. I
presumed they were built at multiple locations and the Squadron assembled
at the homeworld).

As for number 3, the lanthanum, it gives a very good reason why a world
capable of making starships in a pocket empire must conquer new worlds, to
obtain lanthanum to build newer (and bigger) starships. You may want to
consider a lanthanum factor based on the world size and density, being how
much can be mined per year. Its consumption would be linked to Jump Drive
mass (i.e. we only dig enough lanthanum to build 1000 tons of jump drives a
year, do we build one jump-3 25,000 ton battlecruiser or 2 jump-4 10,000
ton heavy cruisers? Planet X has lanthanum? Great, hang on while I embark
my infantry division.....)

The overload is critical - the interesting thing is that the rules
currently underplay the effectiveness of the laser PD by limiting it to
attacking 1 target. So a RL attack in the Traveller Universe would need
significantly more missiles to have any chance of penetrating the sand,
Nuke Damper and Laser PD barrage.

Of course, another disregraded anti-missile defense is a nuclear warhead or
two, a la missile command.

  That should only remove them from real use as long-range anti-starship 
weapons; they\'ll still waste missiles at 1000 or 10,000 km easily enough.
If spinal (or other?) PAWS don\'t require/use grav-focussing then you\'ll
see a clear definition between PAWS (offensive heavy batteries) and all
other weapons (special functions or "tertiary" systems).

This reminds me of a comic book I read years and years ago, where this
alien from a methane planet is sent to earth in order to spy the best way
of taking it over.  As an \'earthling\', he does everything he can to fit in.
 Including learning to smoke cigarettes.  Some weeks pass by and he accrues
tons of great invasion info which he transports to his homeworld.  After a
day of back-patting and congratulations, he finally has a few moments
alone.  He absent-mindedly lights up a cigarrette......

BOOM!

His planet blows up.

Hey, the best part of that resurrection scene was where Jar-Jar volunteers
to give his life to provide the life-force necessary to resurrect Yoda.  And
you think Yoda talked funny *before* he died...

This is similar to my situation at 
http://www.datatone.com/~robb/traveller/Eideann.html

A balkanized world with a general TL8, one government (a Fuedal Technocracy)
has just discovered the Jump-1 Drive at one of their secret research labs 
in a low tidal flux area. (I have been assuming that Jump-0 drives are
possible at TL8, but perhaps I am wrong). They are about to send a scout ship
to explore nearby worlds (as soon as I build the thing, and decide what it
looks like), and hopefully get the jump on their competition (two
oligarchies).

I rolled up the sector according to the alternate world generation system in
galactic 2.4, and there was only 1 spacefaring civilization in the entire 
sector, so I made them my homeworld.

This is on topic, though it might not seem like it :)
You can almost see this happening today. In the bad old days, if you 
had an Apple II .sqz file, good luck unsqueezing it on a PC, and you
couldn\'t get Arc for the Apple. Because I had a bit of computer skill,
I could get specialized software to untar and uncompress unix files,
but I am sure I was the exception. Now I have an unzip program that
recognizes every compression method I have come across, and a paint
program that recognizes quite a few that I haven\'t. I have CDs that
can be read on all standard OSes. As we move in TL9 I think we will
see more of this, except the new standards will have to be fought out.

Last time I checked (a couple of months ago at CompUSA) iMacs were
selling for about $1100.  However, the computer market is rather
volatile right now, so that has probably changed.

Unfortunately, case law does not agree with you.
While in the abstract, many people may consider a hand-painted
\'copy\' the same as a \'photocopy\' in terms of \'originality\', copyright
law (and most laws) have no problem defining words differently
from their common parlance meanings.  A hand-painted copy
requires skill and creativity to produce, while you and I may
differ on the amount of creativity involved, and that might
vary greatly by the painting (after all, there are some paintings
that are nothing but a blue square on a canvas), compared to
a mechanical reporduction, such as a photocopy, the distinction
should be clear.

My painting may be a \'rip-off\', just using the idea of the other artist,
but idea\'s aren\'t protected by copyright.

Again, the law, where it defines words, tends to define them narrowly,
and they get further narrowed in subsequent case law.  If a work,
no matter how produced, meets the criteria for an original work of
authorship, its a "work" and not a "copy", for the purposes of the
law.  There is still a bit of "magic words" used in the law, especially
in wills and realestate, and I guess there always will be.

As I mentioned before, photography issues in copyright are much more
complex and push the envelope of relevant theories.  TAS designated
Gray Zone.  The courts are confused here just as much as most people.
Some judges have said in UK copyright disputes that a table of contents
alone _may_ qaulify for copyright protection.

Which book are you talking about?  I\'m not sure where the SM
data is first presented.

The data can qualify for copyright.  So can the map representing it
on page 23.  So can my map.

Distribution is a separate type of infringement.  It also implicates
trademark law, as well as state laws (and the EU laws, IIRC) about
Misrepresentation.  And the theories for these other types of laws
quickly bleed over into what should be a discrete issue, contaminating
copyright jurisprudence.  Its a flood and you can\'t stop it.
You are certainly correct that the mere act of reproduction meets the criteria
for infringement, assuming the Fair Use doctrine is not implicated (but the
Fair Use anaylsis happens before the infringement analysis, i.e, Sec 106
of the copyright act, is subject to Sec 107: the Fair Use section; so the
analysis should be:

(1) Is the allegedly infringed work protected by copyright?;
if No, case over
if Yes, then (2) Is the allegedly infringing work/copy a fair use of the first work?;
if Yes, case over
if No, then (3) has the defendant infringed the copyright owner\'s exclusive rights
to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform
the work, or publicly display the work?
if Yes, infringement - award damages
if No, case over - defendant\'s work if fine.

I can\'t tell you how many times I have heard this case and others related
to it.  I have a particulary familiarity with it.  I agree with that opinion.

Correct.  It is part of a copyrighted work.  Its protected.  Even if it
were presented alone, it should be protected, IMO.

No.  Presenting something in a different way is expression.
If done with enough originality, its worthy of copyright protection
on its own.  It has a shot at being a derivative work.  Not
definitely, but maybe.  However, GDW/FFE created a map
and published it.  There is little doubt that it is independently
copyrighted as a graphical work.  But whats original to that
graphical work?  NOT the data it incoporates.  That data is
already protected.  The map copyright covers the "original"
contributions added.  Likewise, my map (when I finish it)
_could_ qualify for copyright on its own, but only to the
"original" elements that I add.  (Note: I wouldn\'t think
about ever letting my map see the light of day without
permission from FFE).

IMO, but reasonable people can differ, there isn\'t a whole
lot of originality in a map reflecting the data of the SM.
Both are "functional" - a bad thing for copyrights as it makes
them weaker.  Black and white dots (or colored circles if you\'ve got the
poster map), the arrangement of which is already pre-determined
by the hex-grid system, political borders, a legend, the names of
the subsectors and planets, etc.  I think that two people, given the
same data and hex-grid would come up with substantially similar maps.

I\'m not going to argue this on the list.  Courts make errors.  The only
way a court can correct them is if someone appeals.  Even then,
there are errors.  Its because courts make mistakes (not that they
make mistakes most or even a lot of the time), especially in technical
issues, such as copyright, trademark and patent, that the US created
a separate appellate court for this stuff.  Its because they make mistakes
that you don\'t even want to take the chance in court.  Of course, they have
to work from Congressionally-created laws, so who can blame them.

Not to mention that there are US Federal Circuits that have rulings
contrary to each other time.  That creates a difference in Federal law
based on the region you\'re in.  When it becomes a big enough problem,
the Supreme Court will take the case, hopefully.  Whether the SC does
or doesn\'t, both Circuits can\'t be right, they can both be wrong.  ;-)

The Fair Use law says "such as".  The fair use factors are open-ended.
Throw in the kitchen sink.  In law school, we were taught to say that:
\'Because the fair use elements described in the Copyright act are a
non-exhaustive description of individually non-determinative factors,
to which a court may freely add issues it deems relevant and worthy,
designed to suggest the type of analysis that a court should perform in
a given case, applying traditional rules of statutory construction is
both unnecessary and non-productive."

You have to look at case-law to see what they really use.
Varies greatly.

Remember that repoduction alone is technically infringement.  But,
there is a library and archiving exception.

I\'ll admit, its no slam dunk for me, and there are points on the
other side, but I think I\'ll win by a clear margin (1 touchdown,
2 soccer goals, 3 hocky goals, whichever scoring metaphor
you prefer).

There is an informative, if 5 years out of date, FAQ here,
that discusses these issues well:

While all information in this post is believed to be correct at the
time of writing, this article is for educational purposes only and is
not intended as legal advice.  If you require legal advice, you
should consult with a legal practitioner licensed to practice in your
jurisdiction.

Rob, the agreements/licenses you have with Loren and Marc are
going to govern your rights to the maps you didn\'t create from scratch.
Most probably, you have none and GDW/FFE and DGP/Sanger has
them.  Unless there is something "original" about the colors and details
you used, it won\'t indepently qualify for copyright (green grass, brown
deserts, blue water - not very "original") and would be considered a
derivative work made with permission - rights to the author of the
underlying work.

The date of creation of the works may be important.  (I\'m guessing that
some of these are pre-1989).

You\'re problems with DGP should be handled separately, i.e.,
don\'t use \'self-help\' by infringing their copyright because they
didn\'t pay you for something else.  However, if you license is
valid, its still valid.

You would have the copyright to maps you created.
Depending on the date, the notice may be necessary to protect
your rights.

Since 1988, you are no longer required to put the copyright
notice on works you create. If the works
are pre-1988, what Paul has done is publish the works without
notice.  If Rob did this, he could very well abandon his rights.

I\'m not certain that an infringer is at any greater liability risk
for not including the copyright notice when he is already
infringing by displaying publicly without permission.  The presence
of the copyright symbol puts infringers on notice that the work
is copyrighted.  The advantage for the copyright owner is that
"statutory damages", damaged automatically ordered by law,
will be awarded in addition to normal infringement damages.
Neither can the defendant plead "innocent infringement"
as a defense. As a general note:  notice is no longer required.
Nor is it necessary.  But its good to do.  And free.


Copyright notice should have:
C-in-a-circle or "Copyright" or "Copr."
+
The year of first publication
+
Name of copyright owner.

So this notice:
"This drawing  Robert Prior, 19nn, based on a map  Game Designers
Workshop, 19nn. Used with permission."

For the Rob-modified maps, the notice need only read:
"This drawing  Game Designers Workshop, 19nn. Used with permission."

The (C) Robert Prior, 19nn, isn\'t accurate.  If its done with permission,
you don\'t get the copyright, the original owner never gave it up, they
merely licensed you to use it.  Adding something informational,
such as

"Modified with permission, by Robert Prior, 19nn."
isn\'t necessary but its helpful.  Potentially, this will protect your
"right of attribution".  Attribution rights vary, but tend to be
substantially stronger outside the US.  I have only a passing
knowledge of them.

You can get Celeron systems for $350 - less than half.
The Celeron 366 chip is ideal right now - it will overclock
stably to 550 MHz.  And you can find the processor for
$60.  Add MB, case, RAM, vid card, sound card, speakers,
HD, floppy, monitor, mouse and keyboard - and you\'re done.

\'Fraid not.

Every since CT, a starship, by definition, is nothing more
(or less) than a spaceship with a jump drive.

Class A starports can build repair space/starships because
they can build both spaceships and jump drives.
Class B can build/repair any space-going vessel but cannot
build jump drives. I believe they can _repair_ jump drives,
depending on the damage (maybe just a very old house rule).
Class C can repair most space-going vessels and doesn\'t have
a prayer of even fixing a jump drive.

Yeah, the hairless ones *really* looked stupid. Anybody figure out where
they got that mini-nuke? Cool fx! I\'m really surprised Lucas left it out of

Actually, you just put on a shell (padded underneath, that you eject).
But you really don\'t need to protect from all directions, so what
you really just do is deploy a mirror in front of you after you launch.

Well, to the original point, the iMac was much less than twice
the $750-$800 cost the original poster quoted.

A monitor similar to the ones that Apple uses cost $200 and
up.  So you are already well above 1/2 the cost of the iMac
system.  Then you have to look at everything you get (or
we get back to the old problem we had with the Mac Plus where
someone would compare a barebones system that didn\'t have
all the same stuff and often was cheaply made).

But this is off topic, so I\'ll stop here.

Boba Fett AKA Darth Maul\'s unmasking after the grav-ball game 
was great, but I was upset that Lucas decided to make the Ewoks 
the race who built the Millennium Falcon... and the movie never really 
explained why they sold it to Boba Fett.  I figured that he gave the 
Ewoks the mini-nuke as payment for the ship - but when I saw it the 
second time I realized that they never explicitly said it in the movie.

It looks reasonable to me - Someone else can do the maths. It doesn\'t work
for FFS2 lasers as they stand without recalculating the USD rating because
the ROF is factored in as extra damage, not as reduced difficulty to hit.

This requires a launch within 1/5th of a light second if it is to acquire

If I read this correctly, your engine can burn at 105G in a turn but could
only achieve this for 20%ish of a turn before it completely fuels out? If
so, consider dropping 3 of the EAPLaC modules, which changes the G rating
to (400-300) / (3.795-1.8) = which still gives you a 50G rating....

With a 60000km sensor range it\'s not very stand off. It needs an active
data feed. Consider better sensors.

Now... if I remember correctly I\'ll actually calculate the range that the
missile has if firing at full thrust.

Assuming initially at rest, and 30 min turns, plus fuel for 6 min (360
seconds burn), this missile flames out (goes inertial) after it has
travelled:

s = ut + 0.5at^2

U=0
t=360
a=105x10 = 1050 ms-2

so s = 0 + 0.5 x 1050 * 360 *360 = 68040 km

with a terminal velocity (assuming all thrust at target) of v = u +at
=0+1050x360
= 378,000 ms-1 or 378 km s-1, or ~1.3% lightspeed.

Which gives the missile 0.5 x 3.9 x (378,000)^2 J = 278,624 MJ..... if it
collides....

Personnally, I think it\'s under ranged and under sensored...

There again, I\'m not a FFS1/TNEr at heart.

Romulan Bird of Prey Class VI Cruiser - 60 - 80 mt

>  Klingon D7 Cruiser (Battle cruiser from the Original series)

D7A Paingiver Class VIII Cruiser - 100 to 120 mt

I assume these are MegaTonnes (ie 1,000,000 metric tonne units)

From (2) 50 metric tonnes = 1 SCU (standard cargo unit) = 6.75m3 =
1.5m*1.5m*3m

1 mt = 20,000 SCU = 135,000m3

I leave the rest to your calculator... ;-)

What about annual maintenance? GT(FT) says annual maintenance maintenance
can be performed at a Class IV or V starport. (This corresponds, I believe,
to Class B and A). Further it says ship\'s crew can complete annual
maintenance themselves at a Class III (C) starport in an extended period.

I always believed that annual maintenance was primarily for the jump drive.
I thought that they had to be balanced, or have the spark plugs changed or
something.  You know hook it up to that big red box in the garage with all
those dials and LED\'s and stuff, so the mechanic could tell you that the
fuel injector was burning too rich, and you needed another pollution control
chip at $180 a whack----oops, I digress.

Anyway has GT strayed dramatically from CT on this point?  I seem to recall
reading about the special equipment only available at Class A or B starports
to setup jump drives yearly, with a table of chances for misjump if
maintenance wasn\'t carried out. Can someone tell me the source and how close
the GT(FT) version is to CT?

Impressive:

Celeron ~$60
MB ~$50
Case~$50
RAM ~$150
VidCard ~$50-$100
Sound Card ~$60
CD ~$50
Speakers (crappy ones) ~$20
HDD ~$180
Monitor (really crappy one)~$150
Ethernet card ~$50
Floppy ~$50
Mouse ~$10 (gawdawful one)
Keyboard ~$30
USB card (if it\'s not on the MB) ~$50

total ~$960

Imac _list_ $1195. Your bargain Celeron is running at 80% of the cost of
an iMac, for really crappy components. This actually isn\'t a Apples vs
Wintels picture, either.

I know, I\'ve had to support people who were _sure_ they could buy a
computer for less than the $1200 we usually tell \'em to spend on a name
brand system, such as a Dell or Gateway. They usually do save a few
bucks, and pay for it with downtime, endless waits for warantee service,
etc.

Buying the parts and rolling your own has long looked very attractive,
but in practice, it\'s rarely saved much. Buying name brand components
(ie: SoundBlaster cards, not SB \'compatible\', ATI video cards, not Lucky
Golden Dragon Computer Supply and Cannery ones, etc;-) usually runs the
cost up to more than what that same computer put together by a bigger
manufacturer will cost you. It\'s amazing what discounts bulk purchasing
at wholesale pricing gets you.

    'body' => 'My assumptions about the frozen watch follow from a JTAS article about
High Guard and Trillion Credit Squadron (and yes, I am too lazy to look
up the citation).  In HG ship design, the USP crew factor is simply
factor of ten, and combat hits to "crew" knock the USP down by one
factor of ten at a time.  The JTAS article suggested instead, if I
recall correctly, that the USP crew factor be a multiple of, I think
100.  

For example:
Ship #1 crew = 400 
HG USP for crew = 2 (10 to the second power)
JTAS USP for crew = 4 (4 times 100)

Ship #2 crew = 4,400
HG USP for crew = 3 (10 to the third power)
JTAS USP for crew = 44 (44 times 100)

So if you get a crew hit in space combat under the JTAS article\'s
system, you knocked off a factor of 100.  The frozen watch could be
awakened 100 at a time to make up for losses.  Ship #1 might have a
frozen watch of 100, for example, which would make up for one crew hit. 
Shipe #2\'s frozen watch might be 1000, to make up for 10 crew hits.

Or something like that, anyway.

Based on the foregoing, I\'ve always assumed that the frozen watch
rotates with the other watches.  Ship #1 has 400 crew plus 100 frozen
watch, for a real total of 500.  During any given period, some 100 crew
persons are in low berth and the other 400 are serving. Every crew
member (with the likely exceptions of senior officers, department heads,
and senior NCOs) serves in the frozen watch in regular rotation.  What
that rotation is I\'m not sure.  Does every jump have a new frozen watch?
or maybe a new watch is frozen every five or ten jumps?  If you change
the frozen watch too often, it seems to me that you increase the number
of casualties coming out of low berth.  If you don\'t change it often
enough, the frozen watch doesn\'t have as many of the same shared
experiences as you would like for good unit cohesion and morale.  So
it\'s a difficult question.  

I don\'t subscribe to the idea that people choose or are chosen for
frozen watch because they\'re antisocial, psychotic, or whatever.  It\'s
not good for morale, for one thing.  For another, when you wake them up
to make up for battle losses, you want them to be able to jump in and
work with the rest of the surviving crew, so they shouldn\'t be the
alienated and hard-to-work-with types.

Good point, but in reality, what makes good sense isn\'t what officialdom
always does.  I agreed with the "antisocial for FW" idea in principle.  The
squad/section/platoon/whatever commander has had enough of Smythe\'s
behaviour and thinks a stint in FW for a year or so would do him (the
commander, not Smythe) good, orders issued, paper\'s signed, Smythe reports
to the FWOD or FWMO, processed, and is popsicled.

I\'ve even seen a civvy business send someone they couldn\'t really spare out
on a minor service call-out to get him out of the Manager\'s hair.  The guy
was brilliant and they sent him out on a job to replace a light bulb where
travelling time would take most of the day or something like that, while
"real" jobs sat on the bench... because the Manager wanted a day without him
around.  Not good business in my opinion, but r/l doesn\'t always work by
those rules for some reason?

For similar reasons, I\'ve seen a less qualified staff member sent on a
week-long seminar junket to get him out of the Bosses face when another more
qualified staff member was entitled to go and be trained up!  That\'s just
two that I remember off the top of my head from civvy street... don\'t get me
started with some of the ones I am starting to recall from my service years
(APC\'s, rations, backhoes... sheesh!).

Under High Guard (remember that??), a planetary navy could construct spaceships of the planet\'s tech level regardless of what kind of starport they had.  This included starships for worlds over TL9.

  Jar Jar is a temp replacement for C-3PO (aka comic relief, aka the lucky

   Lucas would be happy that you find the character memorable, even if you
hate it.  The fact that at no point did he actually exist (there was no one
running around in a Jar Jar suit...all computer) is what I will remember,
because it was so damn convincing.  Can a new movie version of "On the

behind?

The alternate annual maintenance rules in Far Trader are virtually a

I used a spreadsheet I have that calculates BTN for all planets in the SM 
against any one planet (Old early MT data, not BtC).  I plugged it in to 
calculate the data for a couple of worlds, and used the average of all of 
the amounts (2.5, 7.5, 25, 75, etc.) on the Dtons table in FT p16.  This 
spreadsheet is just for rough calculations, as it does not calculate 
distances along trade routes, but straightline distances.
The following are my results for the above two calculations (all 
calculations are in Dtons/Year):

Of course.  My post must be taken as my view of official policy, which,
in my experience in civilian life and as a student of history, usually
more or less makes sense, especially in larger and longer-lived
organizations.  What actually happens on a ship, how those policies are
actually applied -- that\'s a different matter.  

Higher-ups can contrive many ways to keep someone in the frozen watch
for too long -- "faulty" warming-up system, so unsafe to thaw until
repaired; "medical reason" not to thaw without major medical facilities
available; etc.  Some captains may use the frozen watch as punishment or
reward, but I suspect that\'s contrary to Imperial naval regulations
(which is not to say that it\'s not done).  (For game purposes, this puts
some risk on the higher-ups, which are the parts usually played by PCs,
so for this reason, too, I like this approach better than making it
official policy to stick problems into cold sleep.)

You also wrote:

The only canonical references (of which I\'m aware) to the frozen watch
refer to it as ship crew, not something used by ground troops.  Still,
it wouldn\'t surprise me to find marines fairly routinely put into low
berths, especially before a long trip to an engagement.  On the other
hand, troops can\'t get over combat stress while sleeping; they need to
do some processing while awake, so the marines won\'t ordinarily be going
from combat to combat with only cold sleep in between (except in wartime
situations, if necessary, and probably sometimes in training).  

How do other groups in the Traveller universe use the frozen watch?  I
doubt the K\'Kree use it at all; they don\'t even like getting indoors,
and certainly not getting into boxes.  The Zhodani probably have some
good psionic approaches to using cold sleep efficiently, as a way to get
over combat stress, and to minimize the psychological stress of waking
up a long long time after going to sleep.  They may even be able to
communicate with the sleeper so that the sleeper gets some shared
experiences and continuity with the other crew.  The Droyne are probably
even better at it than the Zhodani.  Vargr probably don\'t have any
problems, nor advantages, with frozen watch. What about Aslan and
Hivers?

And of course, the opposite happens commonly:  If the worst day out of
the office is better than the best day in the office, then an employee
may do whatever is necessary to get sent somewhere -- anywhere -- else.

I can tell you exactly what Lucas was thinking.

My son\'s favorite scene: Gungans on DINOSAURS! (He practically screamed this

For my son\'s pleasure, I happily put up with Jar Jar. I consider TPM his

To this end, I am asking for your help in identifying good "stuff" that

hosting of current items of interest that are scattered around the web in

not being maintained or updated by their creators any longer.

While I am at it, I\'d like to mention a few of the new additions to
Downport.com

 - Rob Eaglestone\'s library of material ( www.downport.com/eaglestone ) on
Downport.com is still growing.  In addition to the Traveller Geek Code (IMTU
Code) and his modules on starport design, systems defense and corporate
profiles, we have added the "Burito Files" of NPCs and locations for spur of
the moment encounters

 - An new "pocket empire" PBeM game has started and is being featured on
Downport.com ( www.downport.com/pbem )  Set in an alternate universe and
using (basically) CT rules, we hope that this game will be entertaining to
the casual spectator and that it will serve as a source for "mined ideas"
for YTU!

 - Framesets?  Take a look at what we have done in collaboration with Paul
"Deckplans" Schirf ( www.downport.com/tech/deckplans.html ).  Paul was
interested in linking with Downport.com in some way, but we felt that a
simple URL mention wasn\'t going to do justice to the excellent material that
Paul has produced.  If this frameset idea appeals to anyone else who has
great stuff that is in need of greater exposure, let us know!

I\'m not going to disagree on whether or not Jar Jar was convincing or not.
However, there *was* a Jar Jar running around on stage, in fact the motion
and voice actor were one in the same. There *was* someone running around,
it\'s just that the Jar Jar suit was added later.

On the other hand, I must say that I found Jar Jar immensely entertaining,

  With my understanding of the FF&S rules (which is limited) I had thought
that the command portion was already factored into the Missile design
system. So I assumed that say I was 60 hexes away I could launch the
missile have it burn long enough to set it on the proper course then have
it go silent. 
  Also I thought that the range (60k) of the sensors was the Short range,
not the effective range.

  I was figuring on the average capture range (of the sensors) being about
4-6 hexes, that would be when the missile would use most of its thrust for
changing it\'s vector and speed and evade on its last turn, this of course
means it\'s a one shot missile meaning if it misses on that turn it has no
fuel left to try again so it would be programmed to self destruct after
missing. Now If I were to change the engine form 4 x 599 to 1 x 2396 The
rating would as such.

G Rating:   100 / 3.795 = 26.35
Fuel Consumption:  11.25 m3 per hour
Fuel Endurance:   2.386 / 11.25 = 0.212
G Turns:  26.35 x 0.212 = 5.59 (round to 5)
Max Gs per Turn: 5

  which I believe will make it slower and with less endurance
but like I said before this is the area we have the most trouble with the
rules. It seems the bigger the engine the shorter its fuel lasts even
though there is more so we figured it was better to put more smaller ones
of the same mass.

  With the right tactics (At least what I have figured) it would be
reasonable one.

  We have always assumed (Maybe incorrectly) that by the time we develop
Inter Planetary travel with any degree of safety, there would be new armor
that would protect from kinetic damage (Or lessen it). I figured in
Traveller since we have something that negates Inertia it would be
reasonable to assume that it would be used to lower the effectiveness of
Kinetic weapons (Hence the nuke). Because I always thought Inertia is the
primary part of the equation for Kinetic energy.

  Well I ain\'t too familiar with TNE/FF&S either, me I am a CTr but always
like to try new stuff, and since you can\'t build missiles in CT rules I
figured I would try this book out. (I still haven\'t figured out why I
bought it in the first place 5 years ago)

  Why are they so Huge? I know they were much bigger then the standard Star

Hmm. It wasn\'t awful, but I wouldn\'t assign it anything other than
pulp value. Obviously a large part of the intent of the movie was
marketing. A 9 year old in a principal action role is not
insignificant if you are aware of toy demographics for boys (I work
on the educational fringe of the toy market and talk to a lot of toy
manufacturers). Lucas is a smart cookie.

He is still annoying as hell :-) When I saw r2d2 I thought, "ah!
That is why he knows where he is going when they crash in the 1st
movie." Then I see c3po should know too since he was made there. And
why doesn\'t he recognize Lukes last name... but I digress.

Not entirely true. They fabricated jar jar headgear that was worn by
the actor to stand in for the CG jar jar. That way the other actors
had someone to act off of.

The Vilani crew members get tired of having
to eat preserved food.  When people are
flash frozen in low births they taste nice
& fresh later when you need to eat them.

You don\'t think that being cryonically
frozen is really all that dangerous do you?
Obviously low births are Vilani technology
designed to ensure a fresh tasting food
supply :)

Up too late typing!  466 will O/C to 525 no problem.  Some people I
know have it running at 581 with standard cooling.  The 300A will run
stable over 450 (464).

Its only comic relief if there is some dramatic tension to be relieved.
I also have to agree with the criticism that he/it is a new Steppin Fetchit.

Actually, the actor who did the voice did wear a costume and was running
around. You can see him in the "Making Of" type stuff they show now.  The
Jar Jar face is actually on top of his head, and you can see the actors normal
face fully, but the stuff he was wearing even had the skin shading spots, or
whatever.  What is you is "painted over" the real guy.  Just like Roger Rabbit
painted over the sticks and puppets.

While Lucas can certainly live without my $5, he can sure count on
not getting it.  I\'m sitting out from anything Star Wars until Lucas
gives up control.  Which I\'m guessing will be about the same time the
copyrights expire sometime around 2100.

Removing gravitic focussing does not help at TL13 and up when space combat
lasers are all X-ray. At this point the range is 100,000km per metre diameter
of the mirror. You don\'t really need to have gravitic focussing of X-ray
lasers unless either:
	a) you expect your ship\'s troops to act as point defense.
or	b) you want to stop gas giant refuelling with lasers on the homeworld.

Protons and Bob\'s Mesons have very shortwavelengths if you accelerate them
enough, plus spinal mounts can have focussing diameters in the tens of metres,
so the range for such weapons is going to be greater than you can target
(ie several light seconds.)

>Also without gravitic focussing does this mean it may be possible to build
>plasma and fusion guns and have some effect in space?

At best, only for TL12 and below and then fusion guns aren\'t available.

The problem with fusion guns is that the beam is too slow to hit a ship
that can pull several G at any useful range. This is the same problem
as unguided projectile weapons (such as rail guns).

If you accelerate the plasma fast enough to hit (ie >10%c, preferably
nearer 90%c) then the resulting weapons looks just like a particle
accelerator.

Removing the gravitic focussing might just mean that TL9-12 designs
start using more particle accelerators.

Also the point defence lasers become real point defence, with ranges
down to 10,000km max.

Point taken.  I disliked the Gungans but the scene where the ewoks get

Mark,
	You\'d probably have better luck asking these questions over on the mailing list devoted to 
TNE.  Send an email to:
	tne-rces-subscribe@silent-tower.org

As a preview, the Black Curtain is the border of a Virus-ruled empire in which billions of human 
slaves toil under hellish conditions to serve their electronic masters.

I hate to say this, but every time I try to go look at the site, both 
yesterday and today, I couldn\'t find anything except a message saying 
that the page was under construction, and the standard disclaimers 
and copyright info.  No world data.  :(  It\'s a bummer.

Am I missing something?  Thanks in advance for any help I can receive 
on clarifying this issue.  From all reports, the site sounds very 
cool, and I\'m looking forward to checking it out.

<tongue-in-cheek>

Actually, low berths are a Solomani technology, _adapted_ by the Vilani
for food storage.  It wasn\'t until the Vilani encountered Terran
microorganisms that preventing food spoilage became an issue.  (This was
most recently discussed, in gruesome detail, in late October 1998.)

You were expecting maybe Gabby Hayes?  The purpose of a comical sidekick is

The bad news:
I\'ve removed the site until I resolve some copyright issues.
Unfortunately, the Regina map will not be returning... and
the fate of the Risek and Echiste maps are still up in the
air.  Rob Prior, who created most of the maps on the site,
has been very kind about the entire situation and I owe him
a huge debt of gratitude.

The good news:
The site should be back in a few days... and there may
be several new maps... including Craw and Aramanx
if all goes as planned.  And, for the Campaign 
Cartographer users on the list,  many of the maps will 
be available in CC2 format.

As Phil pointed out, gravitic focussing is not necessary for X-ray lasers.
We can already make 1-shot X-ray lasers using longitudinal plasmas, and I
think that real soon now we\'ll be able to get to the soft X-ray regime
using excimer lasers.

Particle accelerators should be viable weapons. Talking to a friend that
works at SLAC building klystrons, they are trying to build said devices in
the 90 GHz range (SLAC uses 16 GHz, if I remember correctly). Once we can
reliably build such klystrons (and it\'s a matter of engineering -- we
already have the math worked out) then one can generate the same energies
that SLAC does in 2 miles using only 10 feet of tunnel.

Side note: That\'s one of the problems with Traveller tech level
advancement; it tends to be linear, whereas real life is exponential.

However, a problem with particle accelerators is that, for space combat,
you want neutral ions that remain undeflected by magnetic fields or other
electromagnetic phenomena. Right now, to make neutral ions one first
accelerates H- ions and then neutralizes them in a chamber of dilute gas to
strip away electrons. No matter how well collimated the initial H- beam is,
the neutralization process results in an angular divergence of ~1
microradian. For 500MeV protons, at 10,000 km range you would have a 10
meter spot size. With higher momentum particles, there would be less
transverse deflection as per normal (relativistic) vector addition. Still,
the problem remains.

Interestingly enough, the best way to minimize angular divergence is to use
kinetic projectiles. For example, a means to send a spacecraft to, say,
Alpha Centauri uses a thrust stream (similiar to the light sail concept in
Robert L. Forward\'s book _Rocheworld_) comprised of intelligent,
self-guiding nanoparticles ("mesoparticles"). See
http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT05/Papers/Bishop/

At a velocity of 5 km/sec, a steel projectile has enough kinetic energy to
vaporize itself, so the line between energy weapon and projectile weapon
begins to blur. Such a weapon, if fired in an atmosphere, would exhibit the
bright streaking seen in meteorites.

Meson guns have problems, unfortunately. It\'s a neat concept, but
fundamentally, one cannot predict the half-life of an individual particle.
Accelerating them means simply that the entire ensemble is translated via
Lorentz transform in time (ie decays a little later due to relativistic
time dilation), but it is still a statistical spread (mesons are bosons, so
they use Bose-Einstein statistics). For short distances, say, medical use
of pions in cancer, this is not a problem, but for long space combat
ranges, it is. You can\'t get around the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
Also, mesons require particle accelerators in their production, so a meson
weapon is an order of magnitude less efficient than a plain particle
accelerator.

As Phil also pointed out, plasma/fusion weapons in space are more like
particle accelerators. Once you get into relativistic velocities (and you
should, for space combat over any decent range) the kinetic energy of a
particle is much larger than its rest mass. An electron has a rest mass of
0.51 MeV, but can get accelerated up to 1 GeV or so. Plasmas are the
equivalent of a two-fluid problem: stationary heavy ions and motile
electrons.  Most plasmas can be approximated by the collisionless model,
because the time scale of interaction for ions vs. electrons is different.
One can do some neat tricks with poloidal magnetic fields and lasers, but
it is still problematic.

So, to sum this up, you are back to four realistic weapons: kinetic, laser,
particle accelerators, and missiles. The line between missiles and kinetic
weapons may blur with brilliant pebble technology; use a detonation nuke or
large nuclear warhead in the missile and it should be sufficiently clear.
The "energy" weapons will probably be short ranged compared to the others.

As a caveat, I prefer playing Traveller as realistic as possible:

things.

Our computer technology, and perhaps several other technologies
at the present day have exceeded the expectations of Traveller Tech
level. We\'ve gone nowhere, AFAIK, in the field of anti-gravity.

Note the major area of research the Solomani have canonically lagged
behind in: Gravitics tech.

Can you imagine a technology more crucial to a race\'s conquest of
space? You can\'t even start on jump drive until you live beyond the
100D limit. The difference between an orbital society based on 
thrust and one based on gravitics will be astonishing. No wonder, for
all our computer and biotech accomplishments, the Ziru Sirka 
thought of us as primitive.

The Ziru Sirka is a space-based empire. Their view of an alien culture\'s
tech will be most highly colored by that culture\'s space flight 
accomplishments. 

The Solomani, once they took over the Ziru Sirka, probably liked the myth
of their low-tech grandparents defeating the high-tech Vilani - a "real
human" wins because he is a "real human", not because of fancier
gadgets, or so the myth will go - thus the Ziru Sirka view of a low-tech
Earth persists, even in histories re-written by the Solomani conquerors.

As long as Earth has tech advancement holes where gravitics and jump 
drive are, we will be considered in the TL8 range overall, at least by
Traveller standards. Anything better we pull off would be discounted as
"cunning gadgets" by any race that did have gravitics and jump drive,
at least if that race were as space-oriented as the Vilani.

That\'s Tonnes MASS, not Tonnes VOLUME/DISPLACEMENT.

You need to multiply the mt value by 135000m3 to convert to cubic metres,
then divide by 13.5 to get Traveller dt -

so 100 mt becomes 13500000 m3 = 1 million dt... hmm

if mt are metric tonnes then the ships are way too small. I think that the
SCU conversion figures are wrong and it messes the whole thing up. Someone
more FFS orientated than me could give an average mass per dt. Someone did
a while back but I\'ve lost the post I did on Fusion drives in HG...

Unsure whether this is the case....

1 hex  = 1/10 light second  = 30,000km
60 hexes = 6 light seconds = 1,800,000 km

1 hex/turn = 60,000 km /hr = 30,000 km/turn

From below, max vel = 378 kps = 1,360,000 km / hr = 680,400 km / turn or
22.68 hexes/turn (2.3 light seconds)

I would personnally go for a single turn burn as otherwise you\'ll need to
manuever to keep the target in sight.

Looking at Brilliant lances, I think you\'re correct, so sensor range is 4
or 8 times better...

If you assume a constant fuel amount, you\'re correct. Smaller engines burn
less fuel in the same time. If this occurs, you need less fuel (or you have
higher endurance). If you have less fuel the mass is reduced. The small
engine also cuts engine mass by 75%. This saving translates to a higher
acceleration than the original, large mass. If you quarter the thrust, you
only need 1/4 the fuel. If that fuel is a significant proportion of the
mass, along with the reduced engine size you may find the missile is faster!

Agreed with respect to the sensors being okay. The fuel endurance is an issue.

Bonded Coherent Superdense is 20 times stronger than steel of the same
thickness. The kinetic energy still has to go somewhere, and that\'s into
the structure.  The equation for KE is 0.5 x mass x Velocity^2. I don\'t
think Traveller has anything which can project inertia negation.

You can with Mayday 1980, or the special missiles supplement in the JTAS

The courier vessel RSN _Outreach_ arrived in the Jokelyn system today, 
bearing reports from the government of Sansterre (Old Islands/Reft Sector) 
that the entire Islands Cluster had inexplicably moved to a war footing. 
Due to the extreme isolation of the Islands Cluster from the Imperium,
no independent confirmation of the situation is available at this time.

There was little detailed information presented to the media, but 
representatives of the Sansterrean government were said to be meeting
with the Imperial Governor in charge of the Jokelyn outpost. Other 
Sansterrean diplomats were seen boarding an Imperiallines charter
vessel, said to be bound for the Imperial Navy Base at Rampart
(Limon/Reft Sector) and points deeper within the Imperium. There are
also reports, though unconfirmed, that representatives of at least two
major StarMerc organizations were travelling with the Sansterrean party. 

A press release from a Sansterrean spokesophont follows:
- ----
"The free peoples of Sansterre have been deeply disturbed by the 
current troubles in the Islands Cluster. Once upon a time, we were
all peaceful worlds, seperated by distance but bound together by
our common roots. Our time of war came with the introduction of
the Jump Drive, but the Imperium aided us in redressing the balance
and bringing peace to the cluster, a peace that has been long and
fruitful. 

Now, there is again the rattlings of sabers, the passage of warships.
It is apparent that, once more, we must ask the aid of our peace-loving
neighbors, the Third Imperium, in bringing a just peace to the spacelanes
of the Cluster. Let our history bring us closer, and mutual action make
us allies in this chaotic time.

The government of Sansterre hereby volunteers itself to the cause of 
peace in the Islands Cluster. With the technological and material aid
of the mighty Imperium, we know that the Sansterrean Fleet can
seperate the belligerent and demilitarize the militant. It will be a long,
hard struggle, but with fortitude and cooperation we will see the end of
war and a just peace in the Cluster, for all our children and our
childrens\' children.

I pity you the hell that you\'re in that JJB actually provides some relief,
comic
or otherwise.

I fully understand the traditional role of comic relief and sidekicks.
But there was zippo dramatic tension that needed relieving and
the use of a what many, including myself, to be a modern Steppin
Fetchit racial stereotype, and/or, poorly realized non-realistic character
(seriously, compare this buffoon to Chewbacca or C3P0 - they don\'t
shake their lips or behave like Keystone Cops).

Look at the fiirst portion of Episode 4:
A starhip is boarded and humans with faces are being killed quickly
by almost unstoppable faceless, cold stormtroopers.
A princess is kidnapped.
Droids escape, are captured then rescued.
Tuskan raiders knock Luke silly.
Solo shoots Greedo down in cold blood without provocation (original film).
In a blur of motion and power, OB1 takes off a guy\'s arm!
No pratfalls, double takes, or lip-shaking.
The speaking of non-humans is either subtitled or untranslated.

Conclusion: This film is to be taken seriously!

Episode 1:
JJB talks funny.  - whether you agree with the racial stereotype criticisms
or not, its pigeon English (so that the kiddies won\'t have to read the
subtitles or have to use their brains to figure out what he said from context,
as is required of Chewbacca\'s growlings).  Same thing for the Asian
accented Trade Federation representatives.
JJB eats a chicken like thing and almost gets in a fight.
JJB gets his lips numbed.
JJB has difficult understanding reality ("Yousa dinkin\' dat yousa people gonna
diieeee?")

Conclusion:  This is light-hearted fare, intended to sell toys to kids.

. Hmmmm... this is interesting. Of course you can\'t predict the 
half-life of an *individual* particle, but I always assumed that you 
used millions of them and a Law of Large Numbers / Central Limit 
Theorem was at work. You seem to imply that\'s not the case. Do I get

My take has always been that an aspect of neuclear damper technology
is a new understanding of the process that lead to decay the discovery
that the process is not truly randomn.  The allows the generation
of particle which _will_ decay in a predetermined time.

Although the specific comparison is different, an age-old repeated error is
being made here.

"Deadweight Tonnage-Metric" refers to *mass*

I\'m not sure what Dom Mooney\'s numbers refer to, but the "tonnage" in
Traveller has always refered to Tons of Displaced Hydrogen.

Tonnage of (wet) Naval vessels refers to tons of displaced water.

The best comparison would be volume.  Multiply "tonnage" of Traveller
vessels by 13.5 to get volume in m^3.

To get Star Trek vessel volume you\'d need to either convert the dimensions
in meters to cubic meters (multiply height times depth times width - of the
"solid" components, not the overall structure!), or convert whatever
"displacement" figure they use to cubic meters.

Not being familiar with the technical info on ST ships, I\'ll leave it at
that.

I do not, however, think that the Constitution Class ships are 160 million
Traveller tons.

That\'s just bizarre enough to work. Clumsy, gangly and (apparently)

be more interesting with that difference. How could a Newt act like

I don\'t think that JarJar speaking in pidgin English (or translated from
Galactic or whatever you choose to believe) is that far off the mark.  I\'ve
done a bit of travelling - just on this world :), but allow me to
extrapolate - and I\'ve yet to see Multilanguage conversations as the norm.
Meaning, people who are communicating to each other using different
languages simultaneously. Most people try and find a common language and
communicate in that.

However poorly they may be able to.

In Part IV, it is made pretty clear that Chewbacca cannot physically speak
the same language as Han, which makes their repartee logical...but how many
languages do you expect one person to learn?  Let\'s see, Han must know
\'Common\', Wookie, Hut , etc....??  I can see a couple, but one for each
species he meets?  Remember, he never (to the best of my recollection)
actually *speaks* any other language, just understands perfectly the
meaning.  Even part VI, they had backed off to the extent of using C3PO as a
translator for Jabba (and implying that there had been other,
unsatisfactory, translation droids.)

I would further point out that conversations with Selbulba and (whatever the
name of the flying starship merchant was) started off as captioned, and the
segued into English - I believe that it was done to allow a more complex
interaction between the characters, without having to slow the pace of the
movie down to allow the audience time to read what was being said - but
still allow the impression of the diversity that you are looking for.

Just for the record, I\'ve done my best *not* to include any spoilers!  :)

Let us bow down to the all knowing Bloo, the man with absolute knowledge of
what should be funny and what shouldn\'t be.

>the use of a what many, including myself, to be a modern Steppin
>Fetchit racial stereotype,

Wow. From my own personal experience, I wouldn\'t say "many". Then again,
maybe it\'s different where you are. I read a wonderful article a few days
ago about Ahmed Best\'s take on the whole "Jar Jar as Steppin Fetchit" racial
stereotype argument. Best, longtime member of the stage-musical group Stomp,
was responsible for the characterization of the character, including the
voice acting.

He was disturbed and confused that people were making such a big fuss about
the characters "racial overtones." He pointed out in no uncertain terms that
Jar Jar was a Gungan, not a Jamaican, African-American or African, and he
questioned the motives of those people who started the debate.

It\'s interesting to note that Ahmed Best is an African-American himself.
It\'s also interesting to note where the complaints are coming from... not
the African-American community, as one might expect, but from two film
critics, one in New York and one in Toronto.

I\'m not sure exactly. Perhaps I overstated myself. Maybe Jar Jar won\'t be
the template for all of my Bwaps. He wasn\'t a template for all of the Gungan
either, but mentioning anymore might be a spoiler. Suffice to say, Jar Jar
was... um... one of a kind ;)

On the other hand, Newts could have some very interesting traits despite
their hard-working demeanor. I always tend to look toward the Japanese first
when figuring out how a culture can clash with itself like that.

The Japanese are largely considered to be hardworking, which is largely
true. They are also single-minded to a large degree. Fads in that culture
are particularly interesting, as they sweep across Japan like an
out-of-control prairie fire.

On the other hand, how many Americans are shocked the first time they see
clips from Japanese game shows? These things are extreme and almost alien to
us (we\'re more used to answering trivia and picking letters to solve a
puzzle, after all). People putting their heads into a plexiglass crate with
a poisonous lizard... People wearing bicycle helmets being beaten with
plastic bats as they run around in mud...

Then, on a whole different level, there\'s Karaoke... let\'s get really drunk,
and make fools of ourselves.

It\'s not difficult to believe that the Bwaps (and their culture) might be
very quirky, maybe even be downright goofy. There seems to be a general
trend that the harder somebody works, the more extreme their method of
"decompression." You don\'t need to look to Japan to see it. College campuses
in the U.S. are also rife with examples. Look at all of the different
traditions that have sprung up as methods to unwind during and after exams.

So, in closing, if Bwaps *are* like Jar Jar, it might be a Jekyll and Hyde
kind of thing going on. They work really hard and are extremely composed,
and then in their off hours they are Jar Jaresque.

I am pleased that even jokes lead to good discussion.

How about Coruscant as Capital? Coruscant is cut from the same mold as the
city-planet from the Foundation series. The Imperium always seemed strongly
inspired by Asimov\'s trilogy. As such, I don\'t think it\'s too difficult to
draw a parallel between these planets.

Hrumpf. Not very thoughtful on Lucas side. Some of us are going to 
see SW1 in English (whenever it hits this side of the 
Atlantic!!!) although English is *not* our main language (Some 
people simply prefer OV. Personally, I have the wonderful choice of 
English or German, although I am a native Catalan-Spanish speaker...)

An alien talking like an alien, like Chewbacca, is OK. It comes with 
the SciFi argument. It is credible. It adds to the atmosphere.

An Alien talking funny, fractured-grammar English is OK. They have 
learned a terran language, but, hey, they have difficulties. Caution: 
who knows what will be difficult for them?

An alien talking funny English ***which can be identified as some 
Earth-slang, dialect, or accent*** is plain nonsense. I won\'t get a 
single word (man, getting used to British and American standard 
accents is hard enough!), and there will be no hint to understand 
what is meant by the context, because, hey, even kids can get that 
funny English, can\'t they?

And besides, it won\'t add an inch of credibility to the story.

ObTrav: Traveller NPCs who aren\'t native Galanglic speakers fall IMTU 
in three broad categories:

1.- Those who don\'t speak it. Yeah, my players suddenly face a guy 
saying "Garkandana Tadaal, Adonee." Pity if they don\'t understand 
Irkonee ;->

2.- Those who know it... a bit. Fractured grammar is common, but they 
won\'t talk like germans speaking in English (unless they are Vargr 
who first learned "Germanic" and *then* Anglic). And, if something 
sounds similar to another Earth language, it is an explainable 
coincidence: The Geonee IMTU have a language which places most verbs 
at the end of sentences. So does German. So they make similar 
grammatical mistakes when talking in English. But they don\'t have a 
German accent!

3.- Those who speak it, period. A story is needed to explain why they 
don\'t have any problem!

Aiieee!!!!  Please, no!  Newts are supposed to be offcious, very

I\'ve always played Newts like the folks at the DMV.  Slaves to The Book and

You\'re generally correct in the aim to avoid religous flamefests, but the
specific post you are quoting is discussing the component quality of top
end manufacturers (eg Dell, Compaq, Apple) vs 3rd party mix n match boxes.

It is actually obTrav if you relate back to the recent discussion on
building Traveller computers from discrete systems from different
manufacturers with common protocols.

And the original discussion started from a query whether anyone had a PC
suitable for Win95 development they wanted to donate to Rob Prior for
software conversion of his Traveller software. Knowing how many people here
work in IT, and how many PCs my company is trashing (486 and Pentiums) for
Y2k, it didn\'t seem too wild a query to ask.

It *hard* SF. Hard to believe, that is.

Hint for non-Trekies. Just assume someone presses CTRL+ALT+DEL on the

The "mt" figure is definately mass, not volume. The text uses metric tonnes
in places, but I can\'t find "mt" defined in the book. I tried using the
cargo mass to volume rules to convert to cubic metres, then to Traveller
displacement tonnage. This came up with 1e6 dt ships....

The above is what I attempted to do...

I worked on this because at one time, I was considering using Star Fleet
Battles rules for starship combat between Star Trek and Traveller ships.  I
even had vector-based movement rules sketched out, but I ran out of steam
before doing much with it.

This is based on the assumption that the Constitution class ship is 190,000
US tons displacement of water (I had 220,000 USdt, but I can\'t recall where
I got that number).

H2O = 1g/ml = 1kg/l
Lhyd= 70.8g/l = .0708kg/l

1 metric ton = 1kl = 1000l

1 metric ton of h2o = 1kl
1 US ton of h20 ~= 909kg ~= .909kl
1 metric ton of Lhyd = 14.124 kl

14.124/0.909 = 15.54

So, basically, a Traveller dt is about 15.54 times larger than a US dt.  If
the Enterprise is 190,000 US dt displacement, it\'s actually only about
12ktons in Traveller (actually 12,226).  At my value of 220,000 US dt, it
masses about 15ktons.

I seem to recall that the Federation scout/destroyer was about 90,000 US dt,
which comes out to about 5800 Traveller dt, which fits with other Traveller
destroyer-class ships.

It makes them seem much less impressive, but it makes the crew and weapon
numbers make more sense (if you assume that a Star-Trek weapons are bay
weapons, not  turret weapons, anyway).

Yes.

Bose-Einstein statistics are used for mesons. Classical statistical
mechanics has three faulty assumptions, namely: 1) distinguishable
particles 2) no use of quantum mechanics (ie classical vs. quantum theory)
and 3) relativistic effects

Even so, at high energy Maxwell-Boltzman, Bose-Einstein, and Fermi-Dirac
statistics look pretty similiar (A*exp(-E/kt), 1/(exp(E/kt)/A-1), and
1/(exp(E/kt)/A+1) respectively [ See
http://www.physics.uc.edu/suranyi/Modern_physics/Lecture_Notes/modern_physics9.h
tml ]. (This URL is probably wrapped, so you may have to cut and paste.)

Nevertheless, if you look at a M-B distribution you will note that it is
sharply peaked at low energies and gets broadened with higher energies. [
See http://www.tannerm.com/physical/maxwell/maxwell-boltzmann.htm ] Since
it is in velocity space, and relativistic effects tie velocity to half
life, your particle ensemble distribution will be governed by a broadly
peaked M-B. Your mesons will decay spread out along the beam path for a
very long distribution.

David Summers comments that perhaps an aspect of nuclear damper technology
allows one to decide that the decay process is not truly random.
Unfortunately, this is in flat contradiction to Quantum Mechanics (and in
particular the Copenhagen Interpretation), which postulates that the
wavefunction of a particle correctly describes that particle, not the
particle ensemble.

Furthermore, there is no way to get around the Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle. Therefore, trying to fix exactly the meson velocity (to ensure
precisely timed decay) will automatically throw the position of the meson
into considerable doubt. In the energy formulation of HUP, trying to fix
the energy of the particle (via relativistic acceleration) will
automatically throw off the lifespan of the particle.

A simple calculation:

HUP: delta X * delta P >= hbar/2

	where X is position, P is momentum, hbar is Planck\'s constant/2*pi.

A neutral pion has a mean life of 8.4(+/- 0.6)E-17 seconds.

Lorentz factor is 1/(1-v^2/c^2)

Distance traveled is velocity times mean life times Lorentz factor.

To get a p0 particle to travel a mere 12,600 kilometers requires a velocity
of 0.999999999999999 c to get a Lorentz factor of 5e14, at which time the
particle has an energy of 1.5e20 GeV.

Note: The highest energy cosmic ray ever recorded was 3e20 eV. The amount
of energy above is something like 24 billion joules per meson, equivalent
to 5 tons of TNT explosive.

These are ridiculous numbers, even before you consider that, to get a meson
to decay within a space of 10 meters introduces an uncertainly in its
lifespan of 3E9 seconds. For all practical matters, the uncertainty of the
meson\'s position is the traversal distance.

   The previews I saw implied that there was no one there, but actually the
way you are describing it makes more sense--I stand corrected.

   This fits with the technique they used to salvage the scene in Episode 4
between Han Solo and Jabba the Hut.  The "real" Jabba was added over the
original human character.

   I\'m not saying that he didn\'t chew on the scenery (sometimes literally)
to the point of distraction, just that I found it interesting just in how
the rendering was done.

   Of that there is little doubt.  He has done an excellent job of
marketing his copyrights and maximizing what they can bring in without
stomping all over fans, who can chose to buy the Star Wars products or not.
 Contrast this to Paramount who stomped out a large number of Star Trek Web

not happy, and neither were a lot of other Star Trek fans.

   You ask why C-3PO doesn\'t remember when you see him get ripped apart in
Episode 5?  I can\'t believe it is the first time...

   Actually I chalk it up to "revisionism can be fun" (sort of like Luke
being allowed to fall in love with what turns out to be his twin
sister--the family relationship was added later to do away with a possible
love triangle)...to be honest I saw no reason why R2 and C-3PO were
included at all, but I guess they had to be inserted somewhere...

   Err...have you seen the film or not?  If not, I\'m not sure your
criticisms are valid if you haven\'t seen the completed work.

   As for Lucas, rumors circulated back in the mid-90s that Steven
Speilberg was going to take over the project as Lucas had no interest.
Lucas has since indicated that he will indeed complete the first of the
"triology of triologies" he envisioned, but that he will not be making the
last of the triologies (which is suppose to take place in the New
Republic).  The list of producer/directors who said unquestionably they
would not do another sequel only to do one later is rather long, so I don\'t
think that Episode 1, 2, and 3 will be the last.  After Lucas passes on,
who knows?  You could well see on the hundredth anniversary of the original
trilogy (c.2077) a remake of all nine films.  Partially filmed in space no
doubt....

Harold

  What a waste of resources! We at the Serendip Combine have avoided the
need for this sort of thing by simply supplying our external affairs
representatives with a few years supply of helpful scripted news reports,
and the authorization to improvise as necessary.

  Frankly, their output will likely bear as much resemblance to reality
as others\' specious, self-serving propaganda.

Manipulation of gravity requires enormous energies per General Relativity.
If we could mass produce micro black holes of a couple gigatons each, we
might have a shot at creating "antigravity".

More or less, the energy required to recreate a 1G field is on the order of
the Earth\'s mass-energy equivalent. If you wanted to create a smaller
gravitational field over a smaller area, it is less, but you are still
considering several megatons of mass energy to do so.

This is why Greg Porter\'s calculations on TL16 weapons using contragravity
nullification look so ridiculous. Contragravity itself requires so much
energy that, by contrast, energy releases by relativistic kinetic weapons
are trivial.

I just went through this...

High Guard, pg. 20: 
A planetary navy may procure ships at any shipyard within the borders of its
subsector; alternatively, a planetary navy may construct ships on its planet,
using local resources, even if a shipyard is not present.

I don\'t see them as bumbling idiots.  I see them as graceful critters, almost

Can\'t.  If Newt\'s ran around like Keystone Cops, stumbling upon
their own lips, blinding themselves with floppy beagle-ears, and
sticking their ant-eater tongues into everything, then maybe.
In any non-silly TU, Gungans would be 1000 years dead.

Its all over the entertainment media.

Best didn\'t create the character.  Lucas has total control over
every element in his movies.  One commentator put it well,
I think, when he said that he doesn\'t beleive that it is any
overt comment, but that by using JJB as comic relief,
he unconsciously uses dated racial stereotypes.  I agree.
Nothing intentional, but should have been reviewed.

Too bad Lucas\'s control meant that no one could
criticize his ideas without fear of being fired.  Even if
he wouldn\'t fire someone, its still a strong step to take.

You are quite correct. Stupid here just substituted "6" for acceleration,
when I should have been using 6 x 9.8 m/s^2 = 58.8 m/s^2 = 0.0588 km/s^2.

The equation should read:

          Substituting in the figures above, we get:
               d = 2 x 0.0588 x 1000^2 / 300000^2
               = 117,600 / 90,000,000,000
               = 0.0000013 km
               = 0.0013 m
               = 0.13 cm

 Well gliding actually is just a controlled fall. 
I would also like to know how to compute Wingspan of ships (Only a few of
the starships IMTU have VTOL capability) I like to make things difficult. :)

  Quite true. Bloody bizarre, though :>

  OK, so there can be a small(-ish) facility for purely local military ship
construction and maintenance, just as a small dedicated corporate facility
can provide support without affecting a worlds starport rating. It might be
a good rule of thumb to restrict that ability to worlds with naval bases.

The operative word is *ships*, ie. the important thing is the prefix.
_Star_ ships or _space_ ships?? Only the latter at B or lesser ports...

 Not a Contra-Grav user, eh?

 The problem with answering the question you ask is that the answers
keep changing. Aeronautic Architecture is still an evolving science, with
new things being discovered/developed all the time.

 Add to this the fact that most Traveller Starship Architects know next
to nothing about aerodynamic science, and are not shy about displaying
this ignorance in print (myself included).

 As for useful advice:
 To survive re-entry, a starship will either have Shields, a belly like the
Space Shuttle (compact and curved), or Contra-Grav. No hot re-entry
with the wings off of a Cesna will succeed unless you have other
compensations. A hull made of Unobtanium is considered "Shields."
 Why do you need the wings from a Cesna? Lift, plain and simple.
The Space Shuttle\'s wings are mainly for CONTROL, not lift. They
allow the shuttle to stabilize and steer its fall to the ground, but they
cannot stop that fall.
 The Cesna, on the other hand, is such a hardy flier that landing is
almost harder than taking off.

 If you want a starship to take off under its own power, it must have either:
  1) so much power/thrust/momentum that gravity and atmosphere are not
obstacles, or
  2) enough wing to lift it to where #1 becomes true.

 In general, successful aircraft have wingspans ranging from 2/3 to 3/2
their length. There are exceptions. If high-G thrust and re-entry are
part of the job description of a ship, go with 2/3 of length...

 The primary reasons our modern aircraft aren\'t also spacecraft are the
above-mentioned rigors of re-entry, and the fact that they are all using
air-breathing engines. Equip an F-4 Phantom or a Saab Draaken with
heat shielding and non-air-breathing engines of equivalent thrust and
trips out to the International Space Station become trivial.

The next question: Why do gearheads care?

 Starship length is important for three reasons. Two of these reasons
are valid as applied to wingspan...

 -determination of overall size for deckplan/external depiction and for
subcraft dispositions.

 -allowable length of spinal mounts.

 -allowable synthetic aperature of sensors.

 Of these, the first and last are valid for wings. Spinal mounts don\'t mount
sideways. The sensor aperature reaon is only partially valid, as wing mounts
normally carry active sensors and thus have a harder time taking
advantage of synthetic aperature. Passive sensors use vast areas of
hull, and are not usually a wise use of wing surface...

I thought that, but didn\'t really want to go off on a limb. I do see a
distinct difference between Sylea (a generic world that becomes a capital)
and *Capital* the center of the Third Imperium, the largest interstellar

Yes, because two newspaper critics made similar comments. One of them was in
one of the New York dailies (the "Steppin Fetchit" comment) and the other (a
more general comment) in one of the Toronto dailies. The media says alot of
things that aren\'t commonly or popularly believed.

>Best didn\'t create the character.  Lucas has total control over


Well, Best created the characterization (which is what I believe I said in
the first place). He was picked by the casting agent on the basis of his
physicality at a Stomp show. On a lark, the casting agent put Best in line
for the voice acting tryouts as well. Best came up with the "Rastafarian on
speed" angle (which is a large part of Jar Jar\'s characterization) on his
own and tried it out it. The voice concept for Jar Jar was Best\'s own. Since
the *only* angle that ties Jar Jar to the black community is the *voice*...
well, you can see where I\'m going.

It\'s also interesting to note that Best said (and I agree) that the
complaints say more about the racism of the movie reviewers than it does
about the racism inherent in the character.

That\'s the understatement of the year.

>Nothing intentional, but should have been reviewed.


I can\'t agree here. The sort of cowardly bungler who makes good in the end
is a common and popular archetype in the visual media... stage, screen and
television... period.

Steppin Fetchit is cowardly, bumbles around.

Jar Jar Binks is cowardly, bumbles around.

Scooby Doo is cowardly, bumbles around.

Is Scooby Doo now an "outdated racial stereotype"? Or, are some people
looking for something to complain about the new Star Wars film because it
doesn\'t live up to the hype and have found a convenient scapegoat?

>Too bad Lucas\'s control meant that no one could
>criticize his ideas without fear of being fired.  Even if
>he wouldn\'t fire someone, its still a strong step to take.


Well, that\'s sad and apparently Ewan MacGregor and Natalie Portman both both
feel very strongly about this. However, in Best\'s own words he said that he
came up with the voice on his own, for whatever it\'s worth. I said he came
up with the characterization, and I stand by that.

  I reserve it for Really Really big ships that land on planets (like the

of a large city to keep from blowing a huge crater in the ground.

  I always thought the Serpent class Scout ship was a good example for a
winged Starship. (I know it had VTOL but it was with thrusters)

I\'m not sure anyone knows the maximum bandwidth down a laser. There are loads
of physical limits to lasers, but there may be many ways to increse the bandwidth.

Take the humble analog phone line in the UK. The physical limit you can drive
the line at it 3 k. Not a lot of bandwidth realy. But you then take this
humble 3 k and you do all sorts of jigery pokery with the signal and add some
compression that the nice people a Hays/USR/Motorola came up with and they
manage to get 56 k bandwidth. It probably won\'t stop there. So your gess to
the amount of bandwidth you can pump down a laser is as good as anyones.

Hope this is of some help.

Sorry, wrong answer. The material is essentially the same as that used
in a number of solid fuel rockets. It will burn quite happily in a
total vacuum.

True, but all the components needed for the combustion are already
present *in* the propellant. 

Heck, just consider a bolt action rifle (or a large artillery piece).
Once you close the breech, there\'s *no* way a significant volume of air
can get into the section of the barrel *behind* the projectile. Yet
they operate quite well in spite of this.

I note that they say nothing about deflagrating propellants requiring
outside sources of oxygen either. :-)

OH? Care to provide a reference where it states this? I suspect that

Not necessarily. Radar doesn\'t spray RF all over the place. It sends
out a *beam* of RF, and scans it across the sky. Lidar can do the same.

Again, I have to point out that the "front" of the missile is not
neccesarily pointing it the direction of travel, and, in fact, when
making course corrections could be pointed at almost *any* angle to the
missile\'s direction of travel. 

This means that hiding the exhaust isn\'t likely to be possible. And
that directional radiators get kinda iffy as well.

The problem is the (only recently realized) detail that the missiles
won\'t be pointing *at* the ship* they are chasing. In fact, they may
spend a fair amount of time broadside on to the target (for most
effective use of delta-V in "jinking").

That makes the mirrors a real pain to keep aligned.

This one would work, but only rarely be *practical*. The problem is
getting the "mines" into an area of space that the ship will pass
through.

That\'s the problem. You *can\'t*. 

At our tech level you can\'t armor a ship and still be able to launch
it. It\'ll be too heavy.

At higher TL\'s you run into the problem that at orbital velocities,
impact energies are such that armor doesn\'t help much. 

At the speeds *ships* move at, armor is just plain out of the question.

BTW, consider that jet fighters have been downed by birds. In one case,
a goose hit the canopy, shattering it.

One of the standard tests for jet engines (and for variouis other parts
of airplanes) is the "chicken cannon". It\'s a gun that fires frozen
chickens at the plane being tested.

Quite a few years back. A lot of the experiments were ruined, because
it was left up for a lot longer than planned on. You see, it was to be
retrieved not long after the time the Challenger blew up. The resulting
setback meant it wasn\'t retrieved several years late.

You\'ve made an elementary error. *Velocity* is easily compensated for
in aiming. What counts is how fast you can *change* your velocity. 

Let\'s say that ship can accelerate at 10g. That means that in it can
change from the predicted position by up to (d=.5at^2) 50 meters in one
seond. If you\'ve got him on passive, he\'s only got .5 seconds, which
reduces the change in position to only 12.5 meters. 

Now reduce that to the more reasonable accelerations in Traveller. Oops!

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is a portable vector format. It\'s even
supported by a lot of software as an *input* format. The problem is
finding one that supports it as an *output* format. :-(

Are you *sure* Postscript is vector format?

Crystals of any element are one big molecule. Crystals of compounds get

Yeah, it was initially designed to model geese and duck

How general a manufacturing technology? I\'ve seen "novelty tech" and

from several Traveller sources.

My take on listed Tech Levels: they represent the *opinion* of whichever
Scout looked at the planet last. The planet could have TL18 bodypainting
technology, but be only TL12 in the "important" things - and so would
only get a TL of C on the UPP.

My essay was oriented on Terra during the First through Nth interstellar
wars, and the early Rule of Man. It\'s my opinion that Terran tech was
unusual during that period, attaining very high levels in some fields but
suffering retarded development in others. The Vilani may have misrecorded
actual Terran tech level due to a bias against cultures without advanced 
gravitics tech, and due to their own lack of knowledge about biological
sciences. As the Terrans have always lagged in gravitics tech, and
excelled in biotech, having an unusual TL profile makes sense - at least
until the Terrans start becoming assimilated into the conquered Ziru
Sirka.

I don\'t think the chickens are supposed to be frozen.

Wasn\'t it British Rail who borrowed a US Air Force "chicken cannon"
to test the cabin of a high-speed train, and were amazed when the
chicken shattered the armored glass, snapped off the steel chairs and
buckled the rear bulkhead of the engineer\'s cabin? As I\'ve heard it, they
called in the USAF engineers for advisement on the test, and were told
they should have thawed the chicken first.  <G>

IMTU the limits on this is in the price. Peace time costs are 2 -10
times higher, wartime no price difference.  No discounts are available
to quantity orders, those discounts require the shipyard.

Are birdstrikes really the same as impact with a frozen bird? I know
that in my company\'s combined finite element analysis product with LSTC,
ANSYS/LS-Dyna, the bird strike materials are a fluid model. Maybe it is
more like a jello filled balloon than a water balloon.

Ob Trav: what kind of interesting atmospheric hazards do the starship
designers have to consider. electrical discharge and high winds in gas
giants come to mind.

That doesn\'t make a lot of sense.  They\'re on the list of Exhibitors

<Sigh> I can see where this is going...

Yes, Adam, mesons guns are impossible, so is antigravity (at a practical
level), and to jump in ahead of you, Jump Drive, for all intents and purposes,
is impossible, too. It is incredibly unlikely that there are a half-dozen
earthlike planets in the nearby galactic region, let alone thousands, and any
human ancestors taken from Earth 300,000 years ago and transplanted onto those
impossible planets would probably only vaguely resemble humans today. Besides,
why would aliens do that anyway? Their bichemistries are likely to be so
alien, that we\'ll have little chance of ever interacting meaningfully with
them, they\'ll be so foreign.

At any rate, our technology is progressing so rapidly, that _we_ would be able
to make heads or tails of our society in 5000 years.

The point is, with rigorous enough analysis, _any_ science fiction or
role-playing setting can rapidly be turned into a cold, hard sf setting, by
throwing away more and more of the \'impossibilities\' until nothing remains
that we can\'t explain in terms of 20th century science. 

Because, after all, we know _everything_, don\'t we? 

All that\'s left is filling in the details, right?

Never mind how that would make the 20th century using the same point of view
expressed by a learned, intelligent rpg-er ca. 3000 BC...

The point I\'m beating on is the term \'suspension of disbelief\' Some people
have higher levels of tolerance than others, but if we wish to discuss the
game setting in a cogent fashion, we do have to agree that some things on
their face do exist: Jump Drives, Meson guns, practical antigravity work, just magically.

I\'m deliberate in choosing that word, and at some point one has to think in
those terms, both in the literal sense and the meaning expressed in Clarke\'s
third law.

After all, how else would our hypothetical gamer in 3000 BC describe
computers? Magic.

How else do we describe Jump drive? Magic.

We can dress it up in all sorts of pseudo-technical analysis and such, but it
is our cultural conceit that we can explain _everything_ in terms of our
current knowledge.

It\'s still, at it\'s heart, Magic.

We\'re given the external parameters of that Magic...a jump takes seven days,
you must expend a volume of hydrogen equivalent to your ship for each jump
number, contragravity only works within 100 diameters or so of a point
gravitational source, but none of these things tells us anything about _how_
they work, any more than knowing  eye of newt, toe of bat, and blood pricked
from the heel of a newborn was in the mixture that the witches in MacBeth used
tells us _how_ they foretold his future to him.

In fact, we can state, with great certainty that those ingredients did not,,
in fact help them divine the future, because you can\'t see the future.
Unfortunately for MacBeth, they ignored our learned arguments and foretold
that he would be King of Scotland.

Of course, the witches in MacBeth are only literary devices, as is MacBeth himself...

But so are Jump drives, contragravity and meson guns...

	[[REPLY from Steve Lieb]]  right, i ignored that to simplify the
example.  to compensate for velocity you need a minimum of 2 plots over
time to determine direction and distance over that "time".  that IS
easy.  but what if the target ship is employing a random vector
adjustment WHILE traveling along a curve?  it\'s rare that a ship would
travel in a straight line (even in microgravity), and then you need a
significant series of plots over time to establish a curve, which can be
altered easily at any time by the target simply slightly changing their
thrust, yes?

	my point, anyway, was first that passive sensors might be more
accurate given the circumstances, and that the "realistic" system in
mantis was only realistic in the representation of ship\'s motions.  i
have yet to see a space combat simulation that seriously addresses the
difficulties in sensing/engaging targets at the 50,000km+ ranges that
are relatively frequently discussed for such conflict.

       2 : Mach Number

in which the maximum wingspan is at the tail of the craft (delta wing).
This is due to the wing having to remain inside the shockwave cone.  If
the wing is placed closer to the nose of craft then the wing will be
shorter.  Future advances may eliminate this restriction.

For atmospheric re-entry the wing should be a low wing design as in the

The problem is of course that so many things are interconnected.  You can\'t
build jet engines until the materials technology catches up.  You could
provide Leonardo da Vinci with the plans for an iMac, but nobody would be
able to build it.

If you go to Third World countries, especially in Africa, you can see an
interesting experiment in technology.  Near the ports and major cities,
high tech is imported, and maintained by locals trained by the
manufacturers.  Some of these people branch out and use their skills as
independent contractors, which allow more people to import high tech.  The
farther you get from the cities, the fewer technicians are available, and
the lower the local tech level.

Read _Guns of the South_ for a good look at the problems of introducing
even a slight TL increase without the supporting technologies.

At the Paris Airshow a few years back, a bird FOD\'ed the MiG-29\'s starboard
engine at a an altitude of a few hundred feet.  A testament to the skill of
the pilot was that he managed to direct the MiG away from the crowd and
then punch out and live to talk about it.

>>>>>>>>>>>>
True, very true. There can still be gaps in the technology, though - 
imagine a culture that develops on a world where the aerial niche is
filled by floaters instead of fliers. No natural examples of winged
flight exist, so while the culture eventually comes up with the material
tech for jet engines, they never figure out lift-generating wings.

They do, however, come up with jet-powered zeppelins, hovercraft,
thrust-supported (rather than lift-supported) aircraft, etc...they just never
built a TL1ish glider.

There will also be the matter of errors in the initial survey. The scout
may miss certain technology that is in limited use, or make an error
analyzing an unfamiliar alternatech. There may also be technologies
the culture has developed, but abandoned - for example, an
environmentally-minded species that knows about nuclear fission
power plants and fusion bombs, but doesn\'t build them. Or a species
that developed TL16 gengineering technology and buried it, afraid of
the ethical crises and dangers the technology presented.

Of course, either of these two examples brings us back to the question
for Tech Levels - are they a matter of what a species *can do*, or what
a species *does*?

Since most tech level evaluations are applied to human colonies, I\'d say
the latter is the intent of the system. In non-human (or alien human)
cultures, there may be a lot of variance from the tech level "norms".

Not necessarily. Recent tests on buckminsterfullerene tubes ("buckytubes")
show a minimum Young\'s modulus of 1 Terapascal, to a maximum of 5
Terapascals. (Compare diamond at 1 Terapascal). This would require that we
be able to weave the "lint" (fibers ~ 0.01 mm long) into a continuous
thread to make buckytube "cloth". See "Extended Bond Order Potential for
Nanomaterials" ( http://www.wag.caltech.edu/foresight/papers/Chepap.html )

Right now Fullerene-polymer compositions have been invented that have
decent Young\'s modulus and strain. See
http://www.godunov.com/Bucky/patents-fulltext/05281653

Given these advancements in materials science, it\'s not only possible to
armor spacecraft, but make a decent SSTO (Single Stage to Orbit) flyer,
efficient scramjets, commuter vectored thrust cars (see
http://cnn.com/TECH/ptech/9905/27/flying.car.reut/ ), rotovators, and a
tower straight up into orbit ("beanstalk").

>At higher TL\'s you run into the problem that at orbital velocities,
>impact energies are such that armor doesn\'t help much.

Relative velocity is important. One could envisage counter-orbits producing
large changes in momentum, but in all likelihood, space traffic control
would put all ships in the same orbital configuration to minimize this.

>At the speeds *ships* move at, armor is just plain out of the question.

Some armor is necessary for shielding from solar wind, radiation, plasma
fields,and micrometeorites encountered near planets. A relative velocity of
>5 km/sec will vaporize most objects, so armor should be relatively thick.
Magnetic shielding might also be possible, depending on the strength of
local stellar and planetary fields. But it would probably not be reliable
(i.e. it wouldn\'t work against non-ferrous or neutral particles, and would
be problematic in a plasma field of any density), and so you are left again
with armor.

In my (non-canon) designs, I place fuel (which constitutes ~80% of ship
mass for the antimatter rockets) around most of the ship, which have an
electropolymorphic hull. The spin cages don\'t benefit from this, but they
are usually retracted when near planetary wells. In general, I see a lot of
Traveller ship designs with bridges, computers, etc. exposed at the nose,
top, etc. I think this is bad engineering; I\'d put these as close to the
center of the ship as possible. However, such ships are not as
aesthetically pleasing, I\'ll admit.

A hit on the canopy is a definite problem, but some have absorbed hits in
the intakes. Glass isn\'t good armor right now.

If I remember correctly, the "frozen" chickens were a mistake the Brits
made when they borrowed the contraption from the U.S. They were wondering
how our planes passed when every single one of theirs failed. ;-)

From the earthtrust home page:

Clarke\'s First Law:

"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is
possible he is almost certainly right. When he states that
something is impossible, he is very probably wrong."

Clarke\'s Second Law:

"The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a
little way past them into the impossible."

Clarke\'s Third Law:

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

and of, course it\'s corollary:

"Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology."

This is the fallacy in your logic. You see, actually, I know we don\'t know
everything. We have plenty of holes in physics in Quantum Mechanics,
General Relativity, etc. Furthermore, there is a lot of exciting technology
coming out, but even more importantly, mankind has a lot of social problems
to deal with: racism, discrimination, inequalities in wealth distribution,
etc. etc.

I enjoy Traveller because it allows me a format whereby I can project the
future by making educated guesses and flat "what-if" statements that fall
in the holes of what we don\'t know. Simultaneously, by adhering strictly to
what we do know, suspension of disbelief is heightened via versimillitude.

Your Traveller includes magic like Jump Drives, Meson guns, antigravity,
that was somewhat loosely based upon the idea of science. My Traveller
includes wormholes, lasers, wondrous new materials, and other hard science
that, so far, have not been disproven. Different strokes for different
folks.

And, by the way, the Drake equation updated with recent planetary
discoveries around distant stars suggests *millions* of potential
civilizations in this galaxy alone, depending upon which constants you
tweak.

Babbage did quite well in the 1800\'s. Notice, again, my sci-fi future is
not 5000 years in the future, but more like a couple of hundred.

>How else do we describe Jump drive? Magic.

Albuquierre warp field. Morris-Thorne-Wheeler wormhole. These ideas work.
(Albuquierre is a bit shaky so far, though.)

Not mine. In the Physics department a student wrote on the chalkboard "The
eyes of physics = the eyes of the world". I wrote back: "Very
self-congratulatory. What is your equation for hope, love, hate, dreams,
fear, anger, society, relationships, families?"

But several hundred years ago mathematicians such as Euler, Newton,
Liebniz, Lagrange, worked out mathematics that we still use today. Three
thousand years ago someone derived a universal constant of nature: pi. The
history of science is a fascinating topic.

If Jump drives, contragravity, and meson guns are literary devices, then
why set exact parameters on them? Let them do whatever is necessary that
they do in the story you tell. That is, for example, the Star Trek/Star
Wars way.

I\'ll enjoy my own gaming style, thanks.

Absolutely! I came out of the Phantom Menace feeling that it was 
influenced heavily by the Foundation Trilogy. That is nicer than
saying Lucas ripped off Azimov. 

I could look at the gleaming silver ships with retro fins and the 
sprawling metroscapes all day. In fact I frequently found myself

While visiting the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space museum last

years of active service. I was surprised to see that 
rapid a turnover; I\'d have thought that it would be
more efficient to keep the same commander for closer

Is a 2-year turnover of command typical for USN vessels?

What\'s the typical command turnover for other 
contemporary earth navies?

What are the reasons for the turnover rate? To keep 
people loyal to the Navy rather than to individual 
commanders (for interchangability/modularity reasons, 
or for fear of mutiny)? To minimize the impact of the 
inevitable turnovers by doing them frequently? To 
give more officers a chance to command ships? 

After a two-year command of a CV, does the skipper go 
on to another ship, or to a desk? How about after 
commanding a smaller ship?

And of course, the ObObTrav (obligatory and obvious):

Do you have to predict when the particles will fail if you have
 the meson gun project a field in which they will fail?

I have always assumed that Meson Gun technology is somehow
related to Nuclear Damper technology.  One part of the meson
gun paints a target spot or sphere on the target ship with
a field that _somehow_ [Insert Scientific Handwave Here]
causes the mesons to decay before they otherwise would.
You then accelerate the mesons to such a relativistic 
speed that only a very few of them would decay normally
before reaching that range.  When the mesons pass through
 the Handwave Field it causes them to decay.  

You are taking advantages of mathematical laws by 
accelerating the Mesons so fast that almost none of them
 will have decayed naturally by the time they reach the
target (maybe those about 5 or 6 standard deviations out).
This explains why the canonical Meson gun does no damage in
its line of fire but only at its point source.  The Handwave
Field makes the mesons all decay there before they otherwise 
would have.

Obviously our handwave field is going to have to be
capable of going through normal matter or you could
stop a meson gun from hitting by stopping its handwave
field from aiming it.  Similarly the Handwave field will
have to be speed of light (or be fired slightly before
the mesons are but we are talking about a moving target)
 I would say that that the Handwave Field is probably 
connected to the beam pointer and when you fire the meson
gun the beam pointer guides the Handwave Field to the
target location.

I suspect the SCU figure is suspect.

6.75 m^3 per 50 metric tons works out to an overall specific gravity of
about 7.41. This is around the density of iron-nickle -- thus, if the SCU
were a solid block of this mineral, it would mass about 50 mt.

This seems a little much to me, even assuming bonded superdense hulls.

From all appearances, ST ships are *spacious*, made of materials light yet
strong which are reinforced by dynamic force fields.

I\'ll let Chris comment on the operational aspects of your design.  As for the economic factors, 
the biggest problem is your freight rate.  550Cr/dton is the rate charged for fairly short-
notice freight.  To achieve an average 95% capacity utilization, you need to begin booking your 
hold space as far in advance as possible.  This means you need to use the 400Cr/dton rate.  When 
you consider that 14,632dtons of freight is an entire days traffic on even the largest route and 
represents a whole weeks worth on most others, you\'ll see that advance booking is an absolute 
necessity for a ship of this size.  Next, the rates in Far Trader assume pick up from, 
and delivery to, the downport.  You have correctly included lighterage costs, but neglected to 
include the additional cost of unloading the ship and then loading the lighter (the freight 
owner will pay to unload the lighter at the downport).  Lighters cost 20Cr/dton round-trip and 
freight-handling is another 16Cr/dton.  This brings the net freight rate to 364Cr/dton and 
leaves the ship with a per-dton/per-parsec profit of 163Cr.

Obviously, this is still way too much money.  After looking at your figures for a bit, I think 
the problem is your use of unrefined fuel.  I didn\'t set the relative prices for refined and 
unrefined fuel.  Obviously they\'re screwed up if simply installing some tiny fuel processors in 
your ship and using unrefined fuel is all it takes to make a fortune in the shipping business.  
Under a free market economy, the price of refined fuel has got to fall.  Rather than screw that 
up, I prefer to think that the price of unrefined fuel has got to come up.  If you look at the 
economics of fuel processing, you\'ll see that in GT it is nearly free to refine fuel.  This 
means that nearly all the cost of refined fuel must be the unrefined fuel.  We could start a 
whole thread on the appropriate price for fuel.  Rather than go any further, I\'m just going to 
force your ship to use refined fuel.

Refined fuel raises your ship\'s costs from 5866.78KCr/Jump to 8866.78KCr/Jump and lowers your 
profit to 61Cr/dton/pc.

This is still a lot of money.  There are two reasons for this.  First, economies of scale mean 
big ships will be more profitable.  This isn\'t a free-ride though, because the trick to staying 
profitable is keeping such a huge ship at an average capacity utilization of 95% jump-in and 
jump-out for 40 years.  It won\'t be an easy task.  Second, there\'s a mistake in the spread-sheet 
I used to calculate break-evens for various ship designs and hence the standard freight rates.  
One of the port fees that the freight owner is responsible for was mistakenly included as 
something the ship owner has to pay.  This results in an 80Cr/dton/jump discrepancy.  The 
solution is to make ship owners pay the Wharf Fees themselves.  I\'ll discuss this with Chris and 
see that it gets appropriately errataed.

You\'ve got the wrong point of view, which is the classical one.

Classical physics says property A can be predicted based upon equations to
arbitrary accuracy. In principle, if you knew all the initial conditions
(mass, spin, charge, parity, etc.) you could predict where it will end up
in the future.

The classical view is wrong. Quantum Mechanics has shown for the last 70
years that, at the heart of it, all things are indeterminate. You cannot
predict exactly the value of property A, but only give statistical
correlation for its various states.

In other words, mesons do not "fail" or decay precisely at some moment
known only to them or some omniscent observer. There is intrinsic
uncertainty in each of their properties, about which we can only make
statistical prognostications. The wavefunction of a meson, per
Schroedinger, is nothing more than a catalog of expectation values.

You cannot know when a meson decays until you measure it. To be precise,
the QM nature of uncertainty in its wavefunction cannot be resolved until a
classical measurement brings about its collapse.

In the famous Schroedinger\'s cat paradox, a cat is placed in a box which
has a particle detector and a particle emission source (say, a radioactive
substance) that we manipulate such that its decay probability is 50% after
half an hour. In half an hour, we open the box and observe whether the cat
is alive or dead. But in the intervening time, Schroedinger argues, is the
cat half-alive or half-dead?

The resolution of this paradox is in the Copenhagen Interpretation. That
is, the emitter is a QM event. The collapse of the wavefunction from a
statistical form to a binary form comes about when the classical particle
detector detects the particle. The cat is alive until the detector makes
the detection. A human opening the box plays no role, ie is not the true
observer. True QM should be and is independent of humans.

The "Handwave Field" you describe that causes a meson to decay in a
predictable matter is another manifestation of a hidden variable. That is,
a property that the meson possesses but that we are unable to measure
intrinsically.

Bell\'s Inequality, rigorously proven in the 60\'s, basically asserts that no
hidden variables can exist unless they are tachyonic.

Now this opens up some interesting possibilities. Physicists have been
fooling around with tachyons for decades. One of the big problems is that
tachyons tend to violate Causality. Humanity is a big fan of Causality; it
allows us to make sense of the universe. But is it truly necessary?

We don\'t actually know. At the length scale humans interact in, our
universe is dominated by photons. Both because we see by them, and because
every interaction that takes place in the daily world is mediated by the
exchange of photons or their virtual counterparts.

However, hold up your thumb for a second. In that time, 10 million
neutrinos from the sun passed through it. Neutrinos outnumber photons in
the universe, and we admit it is impossible for us to have the faintest
idea about the "real universe" of neutrinos when we\'re still working on the
observable photon one. Neutrinos travel slower than c to the best of our
knowledge (chiefly, Supernova 1987), but there are countless interactions
that we are just beginning to decipher.

So, if you are willing to throw away causality, postulate superluminal
hidden variables, and deterministic manipulation for same, go for it. It\'s
conceivable. There\'s a lot that physics tells us that we don\'t know.

Unfortunately, said superluminal hidden variables violate another Traveller
canon that communications does not exceed the speed of starships. However,
you can probably get around this by restricting the length scale to, say, a
few light seconds.

If someone could measure the length scale of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
paradox, that would be a good start. See
http://www.reed.edu/~rsavage/epr.html
For more reading on this, I suggest the works of Novikov "The River of
Time", several papers by Dr. Robert L. Forward, his novel "Timemaster", Kip
Thorne\'s various papers, Matt Visser\'s book on Lorentzian wormholes, etc.

Base the EPR field upon tachyonic neutrinos, and you will have no problems.
Pointing and tracking might be a problem given the Novikov Self-Consistency
Principle. Of course, if you can use the EPR field to generate bosonic
decay (a strong field interaction) and weak field interactions, you
basically have a superluminal disintegrator, but then Traveller posits this
at TL16. Also, your field is indistinguishable from a meson screen, except
that it would be weaker at distance than a local EPR meson screen (assuming
it has some sort of inverse relation to distance, which may not necessarily
be true, but then one has a non-Conservative field). Well, there are enough
mathematical quibbles for now, so I\'ll stop.

This is extremely interesting and far beyond my basic college Physics

You\'re still missing the point, however much I agree with you.  the role of
a Role Playing Game is "fun".  Who the hell cares about what is possible
and what isn\'t?  the ENTIRE POINT is to just have some fun.  Sure, it is in
human nature to debate these fine points but that should be a light-hearted
debate at the most.  when it stops being light-hearted it begins to take
the fun away from the game.  We all have our ideas about things, why can\'t
we all agree to disagree, per se, and get back to having fun?

As for my own games, I care little about strict canon and will use whatever
technologies I want that lend fun and adventure to my own campaigns.  If I
want stargates, teleporters and the like, then hell yes I\'ll use them.  In
my own game I will create a universe where their use is  somewhat logical
(i.e. there is some rationale behind it so the players have some consistency).

But the bottom line is :  FUN.

If you\'ve missed that, then all the techno-raving and science debating in
the world will be for naught because you\'ve lost your players.

There is absolutely no question that PostScript is a vector
format.  You can embed bitmaps in it, but it is first and
foremost a vector format - in fact, it is a \'human readable\'
vector format, being the source code for a program that will draw
the shape in question.

    Of course, G:T, on page 38 (sidebar) states, "We do not specify other

Trader rules, i.e. the GT FT passenger ships with the best return on investment
(ROI). Trade offs between m-drive performance, number of jumps per year, and
passenger revenue have all been balanced to maximise ROI.

The limiting factor is the amount of breakbulk cargo that the passengers carry
with them (1 DT per high passenger, 0.5 DT per mid passenger and 0.125 DT per
low passenger). The loading and unloading of this breakbulk cargo sets the
minimum port time for the ship.

An interesting point for canon is that these passenger liners give a better ROI
at Jump 3 than they do at Jump 2!

A minimum standard of fittings has been applied in line with the luxury liner in
the back of FT:
- - A couple of armed turrets are present to reassure passengers
- - recreation & entertainment facilites are based on passenger numbers (1 hall
per 50 passengers, 1 pool per 50 passengers, plus 1 stage & 1 Theatre).
- - Lifeboats have been added to provide seating for all passengers & crew plus

As far as the mirror goes.  That isn\'t so much a problem.  If you
are in a setting with vectored thrust, you don\'t have to face away
from the ship your are closing on.  Even if you don\'t, the mirror
just has be big enough to shield the ship from the side (which might
mean that missiles should be sphere instead of "torpedo shaped".

The direction radiator can be turned also.  I am, however, presuming
reactionless thrusters that don\'t have an exhaust.

Note 1: EAPlaC doesn\'t have a "maximum" thrust like other rockets
but instead a minimum thurst (so you don\'t need 4 seperate
rockets.)

Note 2: You\'ve multiplied fuel consumptions wrong.
Four hundred tonnes thrust * 0.3 m3/tonne/hr = 120 m3 per hour.
(The 0.225 is a typo, but the big thing is you\'ve dropped a ten.)
So your missile has an endurance of 2 G-turns, not 22...

On the other hand, the image recognition system seems to big.

Also - for proper calculations of missile perfomance there\'s a more
accurate formula that takes into account the way the missiles\'
mass changes with time. You can find it on various web sites
(Joe\'s leaps to mind...); the basic form is something like
G-turns = 1/FC * ln(Mf), where Mf is the "mass fraction" - ratio of
loaded weight to weight without fuel - and ln is the natural log -
but don\'t quote me; look it up.

At TL-14 you can get awe-inspiring performance out of HEPlaR missiles;
expensive but much better than EAPlaC. Still not good enough to
get past good point defence, of course.

It\'s really not that hard. The image of an active sensor "pinging" or
a passive sensor behaving similarly is too simple. The sensor can
measure the ship\'s position (at the time the light left the ship)
nearly perfectly. By doing this continuously, you know the ship\'s
velocity as well, equally nearly perfectly. What you don\'t know is
how the ship\'s velocity changed in the time since the light left it
(1 second for a ship at 1 light second); by accelerating at random
the ship can vary its position compared to your prediction by
(1/2 a (lightlag)^2), or 5 m for a 1-G ship at 1 lightsecond.
At 1/10 of a lightsecond, the evasion gets much smaller...even for
very high acceleration ships. So at 1 lightsecond you can dodge
well even if you\'re a scout, at 1/10 of a lightsecond or 1/30 of
a lightsecond you\'re in trouble even if you can evade at 100 G.

    It could have also happened because over time, people talked about the
Capital being on Sylea.  And, soon the colonists, on the outer rim are
talking about Capital instead of Sylea, and as time goes on, the name is
changed.

	That\'s very similar to how Constantinople became Istanbul,   Istanbul 
is a Turkish pronunciation of the Greek phrase "EIS TEN POLIN"  whihc means 
"To the city".   Turks keptasking Greeks where they were going in the middle 
ages, and they replied "eistenpolin".

I\'m just saying that the difference is in more than name, that\'s all. It may
be the same physical location, but I don\'t think that it\'s the same place,
if that makes any sense.

script writers supposedly followed?  The idea is that in order to maintain
at least a patina of continuity in the jargon, the writers will simply put
[tech] in the script as a kind of symbolic constant when a character uses
technical jargon.  A hypothetical example:

Data:  "Our [tech] emitters are not penetrating the [tech] screen.  I will
have to boost the power to the [tech] in order to breach it."

Later, the jargon police would come in and \'fill in the blanks\'.

How much of the Traveller canon forms actual game mechanics, designed to
create an enjoyable imaginary universe, and how much of it is just otherwise
disposable [tech]?

This is a question each Ref has to answer for his or herself.

In my case, the strongest academic background my players have as a whole is
history, several having various degrees, with comp sci a close second.  If I
ever attempt a historic fanatasy campaign, I\'ll have a pretty tough
audience.  But if I\'m going to run a Trav campaign, and I go nattering on
*too* much about the minutea of Traveller technology canon, I\'ll be getting
[tech] jokes from the gallery pretty damn quick.

As a GM, I always try to play to my audience.  You need enough details to
flesh out the imaginary world and make it interesting for your players, but
not so many that you bog yourself down in a hopeless tangle of
contradictions.  All RPGs have this problem, but in Traveller (and the TML
in particular) its agravated by the collective knowledge of the scientists,
lawyers, soldiers, engineers, economists, historians, etc., that this game
tends to draw.

The TML is often interesting, educational, and just a hoot to read - but
perspective *occasionally* runs in short supply.  :)

The RoM TL attitude of Leroy always reminded me of a scene from the BritCom
Blackadder:
"Here, of Crone, is a bag of moneys..."
holding it out to her
"which i am not going to give you", pulling it back...

Although you really could discuss other topics with him, and I had great
dealings with him. In that respect, he was very reliable to ship the items
on time and in excellent conditon at reasonable prices (Got most of my
boxed games like mayday, asteroid and snapshot from Leroy).
I just say this so newer arrivals dont only get to see his bad side. He
was annoying, yes, but one could get along with him...

 Ok I change the .225 to .3 and get (By doing it the way the book says)
FC x Thr /2= FCR or 100 x 0.3 = 30 / 2 = 15. So the FCR is 15 instead of
11.25 which would make the fuel endurance 2.386/15 = 0.159 and the     
G-turns would be 105.4 x 0.16 = 16 Or am I still doing it wrong?

I\'m only guessing but I\'d think it sounds about right.

From the career progression point of view, if you want people
to command the Navy before they retire, then they need to be
able to reach O10 in at most ten terms (that\'s still a
retirement date of 72.)

At one promotion per term, then either your captains are
going to only have served on and commanded one ship, or
it will be more like first officer on a Gazelle followed
by commanding a small SDB in one term, and so on, through
first officer in a battleship followed by captain of a
battle tender in a later term.

So 2 years sounds about right. For the real high flyers,
about 1 year (since they are getting more than one promotion
per year if you want those Grand Admirals) and a bit longer
for people who are going to retire as captain.

He dropped a decimal point. The speed of light is ~300,000 km/sec. So
378 km/sec is 0.126% lightspeed.

Not terribly likely. It\'s not the sort of thing armor helps with. For
micrometeorites, a layer of foil set from 30 to 100 cm away from the
actual hull will do wonders. The small stuff will hit it and vaporize,
but the fireball won\'t be big enough to reach the hull.

Inertia is *mass*. The velocity term is the one that gets nasty. 

But in any case, you are starting from an incorrect assumption.
Traveller does *not* have the ability to to do *anything* to inertia.
What it has is the ability to negate some portion of acceleration
forces. That\'s *not* the same thing. 

If you could negate inertia, even partially, the effects would apply at
*all* accelerations. And when you turned it off, you\'d assume a
velocity based on your original vector, plus a *percentage* of the
changes made under partial neutralization. With total neutralization,
it\'d work just like in the Lensman stories. You\'d resume the exact
vector you had when you you\'d engaged the neutralizer. 

But in Traveller, we merely have artificial gravity, which like gravity
only produces apparent acceleration forces when being *resisted*
(because it acts on every particle equally). So the g-comp is nothing
more than an artificial gravity field tied to the engines such that it
neutralizes the apparent thrust. 

So, for example, if the drive is pushing you "down" against the floor
with 2 gs, the g-comp field is pulling you *up* with 2gs. Or only 1 g
in ships with decks at right angles to the thrust axis.

The propellant won\'t be affected unless it contains volatile
components that might evaporate.

Vacuum welding can (mostly) be treated by the right choice of lubricant
an materials. In a vacuum, gold plating acts as a lubricant...

Also, presence of "normal" lubricants can be a problem. Some oils will
evaporate, others will turn into sticky gunk. Graphite becomes an
*abrasive* in a vacuum.

Space does not *have* a temperature. It is neither cold nor hot,
because it has no *substance* to *be* cold or hot.

An object in shadow can cool fairly quickly and to fairly low temps. An
object in direct sunlight can get quite hot. 

At, say, -150 C a gun may not be safe to fire. At +150 C, it may fire
on its own.

A mirror layer that is covered by a non-mirror layer is no longer of
any use. The laser will dump energy into the overlying layer, and when
a spot on that layer explodes it\'ll take the mirror coating with it.

"Steppin Fetchit" is a generic name for the cowardly, stupid, *black*

Would a Mac user please binhex a MacDraw file and MacPaint file and
send them to me? I want to see which of my programs on the PC will be
able to read them. I\'ll also dump them to my old MacPlus and try
transferring them to the PC via ZTerm, just to see if the formats wind
up different.

A few interesting details about lanthanum from the CRC handbook:

It reacts slowly with cold water and fairly rapidly with hot water.
It\'s soft enough to cut with a knife. It\'s currently about $2/*gram*.
It changes crystal structure at 310 C, and again at 865 C.

It occurs in the Earth\'s crust at an average of 39 mg/kg.

Actually, it only takes a million tons or so to generate a 1 g field
*over a limited area*. For one thing, the field of a flat plate doesn\'t
drop off via inverse square until the distance from the plate is almost
as great as the diameter of said plate. 

And this is using Newtonian techniques and "brute force". There may be
ways of "finessing" the problem that take much less energy.

The two problems I see are these. First, that 5 meter antenna is going
to make the missile *horribly* easy to detect *and* it\'ll be a major
weakness, as it\'ll be way too easy to damage.

Second, you could pretty much skip the nuke warhead. Once the missile
reaches ~500 km/s its kinetic energy is just as high as the energy
released by the warhead.

Hmmm.. I got mine as a freebie at the San Mateo County fair, after seeing
Weird Al perform.  I\'d imagine that these were produced as part of a school
education project.

It has a GPO number 1995-685-749. but the GPO website doesn\'t seem to
believe in it.

Nope. Just two points will do. For a start, recording all your targets
previous evasion just confuses the issue (unless you need to estimate
their performance or see if they are using "evasion pattern delta".)
Secondly, the effect of microgravity can be ignored. Since the argument
is that 10G or even 1,000G is not enough for a contact missile to evade,
0.001G of microgravity won\'t matter. Any significant gravity due to
stars and planets can be calculated and allowed for (a planet
isn\'t like to take off in a random direction in the next second!)

Two points close together won\'t determine your target\'s vector exactly
(it tends to underestimate the effect of any acceleration between
the points) but if the two points are close enough together in time,
it won\'t matter much.

Not true if you are referring to lightspeed lag. You don\'t care about
the time it takes the active sensor pulse to reach the target, just as
long as when it returns, you know which pulse you sent.

One comment from the "Lasers always hit" side of the fence:

When calculating the automatic kill range, I\'m willing to accept the
concept of a 50G missile that accelerates perpendicular to my line of
sight at 50G in a constant random direction for the full duration of
the time between my sensor pulse hitting it and my laser hitting it,
(presumably after an instantaneous turn).

This is the laser\'s "worst case scenario".

However, to claim that the missile always knows when to change
acceleration (if it detects another sensor pulse, it knows not to
evade because the PD laser pulse is already on its way), and
that it can do this whilst accelerating on an intercept vector
(which won\'t be direcly towards me) at 50G and pointing the armoured,
reflective, sensor array towards me and the emissionless engine
and radiators away from me.

Continuously for half an hour or more (or at least for the couple of
seconds during that time that I decide to fire at it).

All in a 10cm diameter sphere.

It\'s a bit much.

So if lasers don\'t reach their theoretical potential,
I don\'t expect missiles will either.

And if you think that missiles have problems, try evading with a fighter
or a battleship!

Well, I was talking to an Aussie Army Engineering Officer that I know, about
this thread and he told me we never had such a thing in Australia "Thank
goodness!", but the (quote) "Poms did borrow one off the Yanks and used
frozen chickens like thay say (the list), did a bloody hell of a lot of
damage to the test vehicles, but discovered quite a lot about solid shot
effects on them." (unquote).

He produced an engineering mag with a small side bar about it, didn\'t go
into much detail though.

Actually, you\'ve got that wrong. The bandwith is still only 3 kHz. But
they can get a *data rate* of up to 28,800 down that. The 56k is
playing digital games, so the rules are a bit different. But it\'s still
dealing with a *bandwidth* of less than 4kHz. 

Shannon\'s law gives the relationship between bandwidth, data rate and
signal to noise ratio. It\'s a fixed relationship, and we\'ve hit the
hard limits, at least for phone lines.

The laser? Well, first you have to figure what the bandwidth is, and
then consider the modulation a bit. Even so, a huge "dish" won\'t help
that much.

Ever get a look at the old Franz Joseph Designs blueprints for the

	That depends on what you mean by a *lot* of ship. I am not

	as 127 m in diameter. With an average thickness of 20 m,
	this would make the saucer section 253,354 m^3, which

I\'ve dropped the previous message, but the thrust on the thing was 400 tonnes,
wasn\'t it? (All four "engines" together). So the fuel consumption per turn
is 0.3 x 400 / 2 = 60 tonnes per turn.

	[[REPLY from Steve Lieb]]  I must be failing my "communicate ideas"
rolls badly.
	1) i was saying that "it\'s rare a ship would travel in a straight
line (even in microgravity)" - meaning, that in a gravity well ships would
typically be moving in curves, but i postulated that exactly *because*
non-constant curves complicate targetting so much i would think ships in any
possible danger of being fired at would typically move in such curves
whether they were in gravity or not.  this was not to bring it up in terms
of targeting at all (directly).

	[[REPLY from Steve Lieb]]  I don\'t believe so.  I give you two
points.  You can tell me what curve I\'m taking between those two points?  I
really don\'t think so - theoretically it\'s an infinite number of
possibilities, functionally of course there are fewer depending on the
vehicles acceleration potential, but still a LOT.  I give you three, four ,
even five points.  Yes, the closer together these points are in time
functionally limits the number of curves I can manage to fit through them
all, but there\'s still quite a few solutions.  And the closer together the
points are will only have validity if the time between sensor contacts (call
them c1, c2, c3, etc) and weapon termination (meaning specifically the time
the projectile/energy/whatever arrives on TARGET, not the firing of said
weapon) are relatively similar.  For example, if your sensor is sampling 10
times per second (so c1 is at t=.1, c2 is at t=.2) then the weapon arrival
time better also be around .1 from the last c or the firing solution as a
function of the previous c points it effectively useless.  By the time you
get an order of magnitude difference, there\'s no way a sensor can be useful.

	[[REPLY from Steve Lieb]]  Accurate might be the wrong word.  Useful
is better.  Imagine: two ships pop into existence 1 light second apart.
Which one is going to get info about the other quicker - the one with active
sensors or passive sensors?

	[[REPLY from Steve Lieb]]  But wait.  Maybe I\'m a dope but let\'s
scale this down a little.  Assume the missle has 5g acceleration laterally
(IMO if I\'m designing a missile that\'s got 50g accel, I\'m going to use MOST
of that for closing to the target to minimize the time in flight simply to
reduce exposure to target countermeasures and tracking difficulty) if 1g is
10m/s^2, then isn\'t 5g 50m/s^2?  I know this is a curve, but for
simplicity\'s sake can we assume the missile could then be "jinking" around
3m in .1 seconds?  This seems like a HUGE amount for a defense targetting
system to compensate for.
	And why would the missile need to detect an incoming pulse to try to
evade point-defense?  Wouldn\'t it be simpler just to randomize the evasion
program to increase to "max evaseiveness" meaning maximum jitter at, oh, say
1 light second from target?
	Personally, I see with the time-lag due to sensors, and the
evasiveness of missiles, point-defense systems are not going to work much
differently in Traveller than in the modern RW.  The incoming missile has a
theoretical maximum arc change over time.  The point defense object to FILL
this circle of possible future points with damaging fire.  Thats all - it\'s
like shooting with a shotgun.  You try to put the maximum concentration of
shot where you expect the target could be.
	Lasers have an advantage in this role since their rate of fire can
be so high.


	I have one other tangential question: are the thrusters on a ship
typically uniform in distribution?  I mean, in Mayday for example, a 2g ship
could alter it\'s future position by 2 hex in any direction.  I guess I would
not imagine that this is the maximum utility for the placement of these
thrusters.  As long as the ship can decelerate minimally (1g) I would
imagine MOST ships would direct most of the thrust backward, since in a
pinch you can spin the ship to use that thrust to stop if you have to. To
use a better example, a 4g civilian courier wouldn\'t have that much need for
lateral acceleration, and put "1g" thrusters to fore, starboard and port,
but put the rest of the thrust to aft.  Doesn\'t that make more sense?

Actually there was a darkly humorous horror film a few years back called
"The Lift" about... a murderous malfunctioning elevator. Although completely
improbable it was humorous. Should be required viewing for anyone running a
campaign in the Virus era.

The universe has a background radiation field of 3K temperature (microwave
frequency). You have a limited view of the vacuum, in that you expect that
the presence or absence of mass constitutes it.

In fact, there is a photon field (given above), a neutrino field, cosmic
rays, and the odd hydrogen atom at densities which vary dependent upon your
region.

The temperature near Jupiter is up to 700 million degrees due to plasma
fields and complex magnetic interactions of that planet. Plasma
temperatures are outside our realm of experience because we usually do not
directly experience them. (A flourescent light makes use of a 20,000K
plasma, for example.) The heat transfer capacity of the Jovian plasma field
is not high compared with our normal experience, but it is inaccurate to
say there is no temperature there.

The problem of a vacuum is one of the last problems of physics, because
even if you could perfectly isolate a patch of space from photons,
neutrinos, mass, cosmic rays, etc. there are still virtual particles
present (via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle). Furthermore, there is a
quantum zero point energy that, depending upon the theory, arises from the
Cosmological Constant.

RF communications could evolve, certainly, in large lifeforms in an
appropriate medium our ever-present \'giant things living in gas giants\'
would plausibly evolve this. all it takes is electrical generation
(which is possible electric eels do it) and reception organs (whihc is
why they have to be big)

This might also work for aquatic organisms, who could possibly evolve
VLF radio, similar to what the US uses for communications with
submarines.

Deep Space survivability is iffier. You need to come up with a plausible
reason that they would need it. One scenario that comes to mind is a
life form evolves in a gas giant atmosphere, that for some reason is
slowly stripped of it\'s atmosphere. The organism could evolve defenses
against drying, and there would be a large variety of symbiotes and/or
parasites specializing in different functions, such as propulsion and
photosynthesis.

It owuld probably have an interesting life cycle, and probably migrate
to and from atmospheres in the system it evolved in, as some elements,
such as nitrogen might be hard to come by.

Alternatively they could inhabit cometary belts, and use that material,
thin as it is, as \'food\' to supplement photosynthesis.

An interesting concept, particularly if they have developed radio commo,
is \'radiosynthesis\' using RF energy to synthesize food. There would have
to be a powerful RF source...they might inhabit systems with brown
dwarfs, which (iirc) are supposed to be radio emitters. (Bruce M?)

More exotic, would be organisms with natural fission reactors. This
would require environemnts quite high in radiactive materials, and some
rather exotic biochemistry, but they certainly would freak the Scouts
who first came upon them...

Evolved contragrav is right out...I think. I can\'t see how that could
evolve from non-contrtagrav mechanisms 

All of the above examples could evolve from simpler mechanisms...for
instance, the fission creatures could have originally simply
encapsulated the fissile material to isolate it from vulnerable organs,
then used these encapsulated bodies for generating warmth, then as an
energy source for the entire organism.

The key to advanced biological features is to imagine how they might
have arisen from simpler mechanisms that were still beneficial to the
organism, under the appropriate evolutionary pressures.

That\'s what I said. Megatons of mass energy.

Flat plates have problems on the edges, as well.

Incorrect.

The definition of a spacetime is a differentiable manifold possessing a
metric. Formally, metric G has the pseudo-Riemannian form diag (-,+,+,+),
has 3+1 dimensions, is Hausdorff and paracompact.

Starting from potentials, construct the affine connection. Deriving the
geodesic, which is the movement of a particle under the influence of
gravity only, use variational calculus to extremize total proper distance.
Parameterizing the curve in proper distance using the four-vector one
derives the geodesic equation in terms of the affine connection. One can
then define the Riemann curvature tensor in terms of the affine connection.

The Riemann tensor govers the difference in acceleration of two
free-falling particles near one another. (For example, in the Earth-Moon
system the Moon distorts the Riemann tensor at the Earth\'s surface, causing
a time dependent piece that we observe as tides.)

Contracting the Riemann tensor gives the Einstein tensor. The Einstein
field equations relate the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of
matter and energy as measured by the stress-energy tensor. [1]

Still with me?

Concluding, in order to change the geodesic (ie, neutralize gravity) you
must change the Riemann tensor. In order to change the Riemann tensor, you
must change the stress-energy tensor. In order to change the stress-energy
tensor, you must change the distribution of mass-energy.

There are several conjectural ways to do this, but that\'s subject for
another post. Suffice it to say that the problem is not as trivial as you
make it sound.

Full details of the mathematical analysis (there\'s just no easy way to
write all those tensors in ASCII) available from the reference.

I used the capture of a rogue superdense moon to pull away the
atmosphere. 
(more embarassment). The superdense material was also crucial in the 
development of the special organs. A big concept of that campaign was
the 
interesection between known space and several dark matter objects. Of 
course, a small amount of dark matter got smeared in the collision and
was 
lying about. <WEG> Even a dark matter lifeform or two lingered

Part of their migratory cycle was to drift in closer to the primary star

and soak up ratiation prior to reproduction through budding.

Actually, from my notes, (which were based on Classic Trav) I only 
specified that there was no reaction mass. I seem to have played about 
with stutterwarp phasing as well but rejected it because of the high 
energy requirements.

I think the contra-grav idea came about as a mechanism for navigating 
within the gas giant.

When the symbiont alien race used the creatures as space vessels and 
floating cities, they of course attached all manner of drives and
weapons 
to the biological hull.

I used something similar once in a radiation beast. I can\'t help it,

 v = at         = (50m/s)(0.1s) = 5m/s (where change in velocity is at issue)
 d = (1/2)at^2  = 0.25m    (for displacement of predicted position)

  I\'m sure the specialists in orbital mechanics can clarify/correct at need.

  And 0.05 ls is still a whopping 15 megameters.

  It\'s sort of assumed that for maneuver (not necessarily evasion...)
purposes that the drives are at the stern and that the ship re-orients
itself during the game turns duration (characteristically fairly long
in Traveller) before making a desired burn.

Oh! Oh! If that other guys gets to get all technical about 
half-dead cats and collapsed wave functions, can I start up about
the fact that inertial mass and gravitational mass are not 
necessarily the same thing?

Really? Does it? I don\'t recall reading that anywhere in "canon"...
Maybe the g-comps negate inertia. Which would be really, really
cool... it might even explain how missles manage to get in and hit 
when they\'d be so easy to shoot down - assuming they\'ve got inertia.

Maybe I can also do some stats up for a gigantic spinal weapon that sucks
all the iron out of a ship...

And they treated Trans-Warp as raising to the fifth power..  1 = c, TW2 =
32c, TW3 = 243c ...TW9 = 59049c and TW10 = 100000c

And it seems that the more radical gearheads keep trying to trim the required fuel further down and down and down.  Pretty soon, I expect them to come up with arguments that say you can fuel a 100kt cruiser on a glass of water for 3 years at high jumps.

Just my opinion, I could be wrong...

Personally, I liked, and still prefer, the MT J-Fuel useage rates for TLs
over 16 and think that there should be some way to factor it for lower tech
levels.  After all, a TL-15 world produces a J-1 Drive that is in all game
respects, the same as one by a TL-10 world.  There should be some sort of
fuel economy and even volume economy factored in somewhere.

It has come to be generic but it was originally specific to a character

It\'s a pretty standard "I can\'t deliver this yet" message generated by
some mail demon. 

Someone\'s box has crashed or isn\'t accepting mail right now, if it
doesn\'t come up you may get more messages like this at longer time
intervals.

Unix sendmail usually tries for up to 5 days, this is some Windows based
mail system, though, so who knows what\'ll happen.

In general you don\'t need to worry about these messages at all.

Not quite generic. Steppin Fetchit was the stage name of an african-american
actor who worked from about the 30s to the 50s. He was well known for his
portrayals of extremely submissive and demeaningly slapstick characters in a
wide variety of films and short subjects.

Most of the ethical problems with Steppin Fetchit come not from the man
himself (he was actually very intelligent and talented) but from the general
mood in Hollywood at the time, in which the only roles for blacks were
demeaning and self-depreciatingly funny ones.

In generic usage, the name indicates that an african-american actor or
performer has "sold out" to take a stereotypically demeaning role in white
cinema or music.

ObTrav: What does it mean to be an Aslan or Vargr in an interstellar society
and culture that is overwhelmingly dominated by humaniti? Is the Imperium
"beyond" stereotyping, or is there a certain way that the Imperium expects
other sentient species to behave?

I\'d suspect that the Aslan would tend to be portrayed in a bizzare dual
light, much like the native Americans were in the 30s and the 60s. On one
hand, remorseless raiders with no respect for Imperial society or culture,
pillaging and looting. On the other hand, they might sometimes be portrayed
as the "noble savage," the ever faithful, ever capable sidekick. Then
there\'d be some who\'d see them the way that the Old West magazines of the
period portrayed the Native Americans: awe-inspiring in ability, but
ultimately tragic characters.

On the other hand, how are Vargr viewed by Imperial citizens? How do the
various non-human races feel in Imperial society?

Useful little chart, but I have a question.  For your "across the Imperium"
distance, you chose 160 pc.  That works for going Core-Rim, Like Lishun to
Solomani Rim, but I\'m curious why you didn\'t use the Imperium\'s longest
axis, Spinward Marches-Empty Quarter.

Larry Niven\'s Smoke Ring books take place in a torus orbiting a neutron 
star, in turn orbiting another star.  The gas torus is caused by tidal 
effects on the gas giant orbiting the neutron star, thinning out the 
atmosphere into a ring of atmosphere around the star.  Your creatures could 
evolve a thicker skin as the atmosphere slowly dissipates over the 
eons.  The two books were real good, but he left it open for another book, 
many years ago, and I am still waiting.

	No. He\'s telling you that at the ranges and timescales we\'re
discussing, he really doesn\'t care if you\'re going in a straight line
or a curve. He\'s still going to hit you. If you DON\'T thrust, you\'re
going in a straight line. If you DO thrust, you still can\'t move far
enough off of the straight line, in most cases, to get out of the
line of fire. And then you throw in rapid fire lasers that saturate a
nice volume AROUND your predicted position, and it\'s toast.

Actually, you don\'t need CG. Solar sails will work, and so will very
crude "reaction drives". Just expell waste materials at high speed and
you\'ll eventually get where you want to go. 

I expect that their metabolic rate would be low, especially while in
transit between planets or belts. 

I have trouble picturing them evolving naturally though. 

If you want something similar that *could* evolve naturally, think
*much* bigger. Then try to find a copy of the old SF novel "The Black
Cloud" by Fred Hoyle. It involves a living *nebula*. That is, a cloud
of dust and gas the better part of a parsec acrosss.

Alas, it\'s been determined that he made a couple of *bad* errors in the

Ah! But you are *assuming* that the force is changing the metric. 

All we need is a force that can affects individual particles equally,
rather than coupling via the surface particles. Then we can cancel the
*effects* of gravity without having to cancel gravity. 

For example, a magnet can lift a chunk of iron against gravity with a
very low energy input. 

We just need an attractive or repulsive force that affects all
particles equally. Once we have that, the actual energy cost of
neutralizing gravity is quite low. It\'s the same as that required to
boost the mass in question to escape velocity (plus losses).

What this mystery force could be, I have no idea. But it doesn\'t have
to be that energy intensive.

Oh yeah, another thing to consider. What if we really *are* using
"gravity" (ie mucking about with the curvature of space time). It\'s
possible to make a section of space time "flat" *locally*. 

To use the typical "rubber sheet" model, you\'d have a place partway up
the side of a gravity well that was flat. The slope on the "downhill"
side of the flat area would be steeper than normal, as would the slope
on the "uphill" side. It\'d be an equipotential surface, at a *non*-zero
potential. So in that area, you\'d get most of the effects of being far
from a gravity well. Just watch out for the edges. :-)

The "evasion distance" is d=.5*a*t^2 where t is the lightspeed lag. 

At 5 g, and .1 seconds that gives:

d=.5*50*.1^2
d=25*.01
d=.25

Thus, in .1 seconds, you can change the endpoint of your position
vector by .25 meters. Which is a bit under 10 inches.

At 1 light second range, the lag is 2 seconds, giving 100 meters. Not
bad, bad it decreases *rapidly*.

As you can see above, the closer you get the less use your "jittering"
is.

True enough, except that with speed-of-light weapons, the volume of
uncertainty becomes quite small at distances we\'d consider huge. That
.1 second lag is at a distance of 15 thousand kilometers. Which is
roughly the diameter of Earth!

Actually, you\'ve got *no* need for thrusters capable of anything
*resembling* 1 g thrust. In space, if you want to change course, you
use inertia wheels or low power thrusters to turn the ship and you then
use the main drive to change the course. 

Consider the length of a "turn", and then work out how *little* thrust
it takes to turn a small ship (Scout, free trader, etc) 180 degrees in
much less than that. 

Say a ship is 40 meters long. That means that to rotate the ship 180
degrees, you need to move the nose thru a distance of pi*radius or
about 62 meters. Say it takes a minute. The forces are going to be less
than a g...

So given that turns are 15-30 minutes, the time to rotate the ship is
neglible. And you don\'t have to brace the ship for large off-axis
thrusts.

For a good fictional version of bioengineered living spaceships, see
Peter Hamilton\'s "The Reality Dysfunction". Surprisingly Travelleresque in
many respects (only with more gratuitous sex, and a bizzare primary
plot.) One faction in the balkanized human space uses bioengineered
ships ("Voidhawks").

Typical tour for a commanding officer in the US Navy at this time is 16
months. Department heads have 18 month tours. Enlisteds serve for from 36 to
60 months.

The ever decreasing numbers of US Navy ships has resulted in the practice of
shortening command tours so that every officer selected for command can
serve as a CO. Since these officers require these tours to advance (Most
ships are commanded by Commanders not Captains) the result is the high
turnover rate.

>After a two-year command of a CV, does the skipper go
>on to another ship, or to a desk? How about after
>commanding a smaller ship?

Typical Navy officer career (surface force) is:
	24 month tour as a junior officer acting as a division officer (Ens-LTJG)
	24 month tour aboard a different command as a division officer (LT.)
	12 months ashore at department head school
	18 month tour as a department head. (LT)
	24 month tour ashore/traveling as either an instructor or an inspection
team member. Possibly with a school tacked on afterwards for another 24
months.
	18 month tour as either a department head on a large vessel (Carrier or
amphibious ship) (LCRD)
	OR
	16 month tour as the XO of a small vessel (Frigate/destroyer)
	Then PCO (Prospective Commanding Officer School) (LCDR or CDR) Upto 49
months.
	16 month tour as a CO (Destroyer/frigate or XO Amphibious ship/support
ship)
	Then another 24 month tour  ashore, probably with a Joint Command (That
means with Army or Airforce Officers or NATO)
	16 Month tour as a Destroyer Squadron commander (CAPTAIN)
	Or
	A staff position for an admiral
At this point the officer will never again command a ship.  Carrier CO/XO\'s
are aviators, and so have a different career track. And of course ever
officer\'s career is different in the details.

>And of course, the ObObTrav (obligatory and obvious):
>What are the answers to all of the above questions for
>the Imperial Navy?

ObTrav:Prime example of the way not to run a navy. CO\'s develop no loyalty
to their crews and vice-versa.  Officers who should be concentrating on
tactics and politics instead spend a great deal of their time learning to be
engineers and sensor specialists, instead of letting the experts handle it.
By the time a CO knows the true capabilities of his ship he is leaving. Many
CO\'s Band-Aid problems, knowing that they\'ll be gone before the problem
becomes impossible to ignore.

I see the Imperial Navy as much closer in pattern to the Royal Navy of the
early Twentieth Century or the US Navy of the last century. Officers
specialize, with some choosing (of having chosen for them) non-command
tracks in engineering, sensors and weapons specialties.  Officers serve on
vessels for extended periods of time, with transfers only done to move
someone to a newly created position or one vacated by retirement, promotion
or death.

Many positions are highly political in nature, with appointments controlled
by the Nobility.  We already know that the Navy is the favorite service for
the second sons/daughters of the nobility.  Most of the rest of the
positions are filled out by men and women from Navy families, some having
histories of service going back a thousand years. Such people take tradition
even more seriously than the most serious of Vilani civilians. Of course
since Imperial Navy units are organized by Domain loyalty to the local
Archduke might be more important than loyalty to the Iridium Throne.

I\'ve got more, but I\'ll probably get around to posting that on my WebPages,
unless someone is interested on my thoughts on a specific point.

Definitely not. Distance "jinked" from original course is (0.5)*(accel)*(t^2),
so in 0.1 seconds it\'s only 0.25 m; the t^2 makes a big, big difference.

The picture of a sensor working in "snapshots" is probably too simple;
but it\'s simpler, so lets use it, and take an example with actual math.

Assume a target at 0.1 lightseconds (30,000 km), with 2G acceleration.
For simplicities sake, assume it has been flying on a constant course for
a while, so initially I know its velocity perfectly. A good sensor can measure
its position to about 5 nanoradians, or a positional error of 0.15 m.
Let\'s assume the sensor updates very, very slowly - ten times a second.
(My math for the Definitive Sensor Rules required sensors to detect targets
faster than this for weapons fire.) During a tenth of a second the ship can
only accelerate by 2 m/s (moving it 0.1 m off its predicted course.) I measure
its position twice with i0.15 m errors; the error in the differences is
~0.2m (=sqrt(0.15^2+0.15^2)) so my estimate of its velocity can be wrong by
up to 2m/s. Let\'s take the worst case; I\'m wrong by 2 m/s and estimate
that it didn\'t accelerate at all. So I fire at the original predicted
position. My
pulse reaches it 0.1 seconds after my second measurement, or 0.2 seconds
after it started accelerating. By
the time the laser pulse reaches the target, it\'s moved
(0.5*2*10m/s^2*(0.2)^2)
or 0.4 m away from that predicted position; less than the diameter of a
big high-performance missile. And that\'s a *bad* case; the sensor really
updates much more often than 10 times a second. Of course, a missile
evades faster than 100G; missiles are hard to hit at 30,000 km - which is why
det-laser missiles are good - but there are t^2 dependences in this, so a
200-G missile at 3000 km is similar to the above example.

(The tradeoffs are more complex, though. The "measurement error" is
really only linear with distance, so at large distances it doesn\'t matter as
much as the ability of the target to move in the delay time, which goes as
range^2.)

Actually, if you want to follow present day as an assumption, I would 
tend to think that the lower tech worlds would have a better 
consumption rate.  Look at Japan when they first came out with 
mass produced cars in the US (and abroad, I assume).  40 to 50 
mpg sure did beat my 18 mpg truck.  Of course, my truck went 
faster and could pull up tree stumps but then you don\'t expect to 
jump across a subsector with a J1 engine either.

Just my 0.02Cr.

Yes indeed. In fact much of the printed material published for fans was
originally put together to give the tech police a standard set of rules to
make the technology as consistent as possible while still furthering the
story.  Contrary to what has been stated in this forum (IMHO) much of the
science on Star Trek was as authentic as possible given what we know, and
using premises like: If we wanted to build a transporter what kind of
technology would we need to do that? The writers were especially adept
(again IMHO) at deriving new devices from technology that had already been
introduced. For example replicators were an outshoot of transporter
technology. The interactive tech manual is a prime example of how detailed a
set of self-consistent fantasy technology can be produced when a highly
intelligent group of individual decide to explain why something works they
way it has been described, rather than why it can\'t work that way.

  All but the War bird will have the minimal armor for the hull. The War

ships drives well that\'s where it gets sticky. 
 For the ST sublight Drives which they called Impulse engines. Well there
seems to be no drive like this listed (I know it is near Inertia less. And
they can achieve speeds nearing the speed of light) I was thinking

 Now all of us in this group have little in a way of science knowledge so I
was just Winging it (Or fudging). But I tried to stay within the confines
of ST. Also I tried not to give away too much to them (They figured it out
when I described the dimensions and shape of the ship to them)

  So is there a Alternative Drive listed in the FF&S book that would be
similar to Impulse drives? Remember they need to be able to stop on a dime
(or the interstellar equivalent.)

  And this is just the drives wait till I ask about the weapons. LOL.

Heheheh... it has evolved into a hidious beast that looks like a koala, but

legend has it that it came about when Americans were stationed in Australia
during WWII, something fell on a GI in the middle of the night during joint
US/Aust exercises and scurried off... leaving the GI scarred with claw (cute
little possums [yeah, the size of a large cat!] and koalas have nasty claws!
Koalas don\'t scurry real well by the way) marks.  When he told his Aussie
allies about it, he was told something to the effect of, "Yeah sport, drop

Indeed.

All you really need is a suitable Brownian motion generator,
like a nice hot cup of tea.

You\'d need some energy input before each jump to reheat the tea and I
reckon you\'d be well advised to make a fresh cup of tea as part of the
annual maintenance.

The jump fuel requirement is fine by me.
<rant>
My grumble is with the absurd fuel requirements for
nuclear power plants as described in the various
rules incarnations - efficiencies are dreadful, far
worse (~100X) than RW fission plants (or projected fusion ones).
</rant>

Terry Carlino wrote about the Star Trek technical
architecture. Yep, it\'s internally consistent, which
is great.

The same degree of internal consistency is what we\'re
trying to achieve for the Imperium campaign background
on this list, isn\'t it? Look at some of the awful
T4 products that appeared when there was a consistency
failure...

I know things get lost in debates which approach the \'how many angels dance on the head of a pin?\'
level of theological intensity, but there would appear
to be some sense in it.... wouldn\'t there?

Don\'t you youngsters recognize references to *classic* Science Fiction
when you read them?

That\'s an *obvious* reference to E.E. "Doc" Smith\'s "Triplanetary".
Specifically to the Nevian ray for extracting allotropic iron.

My rolls are equally bad.
I am approximating your motion using a straight line joining your last two
sensor positions. The best you can do to not be hit is to be as far away
from that line as possible. This means using max acceleration in a radial
distance for the entire time from my first sensor pulse until the weapon
hits You get approx. half the benefit of the time between sensor pulses
plus the full benefit of the time between the second pulse and the weapon
hitting. Any other course of action would put you closer to my estimate for
your position.
Bruce doesn\'t think that the delay between sensor pulses would be significant,
so unless there is reason otherwise, I\'ll just ignore it. Just like I\'ll
ignore the fact that you aren\'t going to have an optimal evasion path.

Unless your acceleration is constant, in a constant direction, then knowing
how you were accelerating 5 seconds ago doesn\'t seem to help.

I will agree, that your acceleration during the time between my two sensor
pulses will put an error into my calculation of your velocity, but unless
the time between those sensor pulses is very long, all it does is add a bit
to your effective acceleration.

I agrees that there are an infinite number of curves between two points,
but if your acceleration isn\'t constant, then there are an infinite number 
of curves joining the last two points, even if I know a million previous
positions.

The most extreme error is given if you accelerate at maximum rate in one
direction for the whole time between sensor pulses. If this isn\'t enough
to help (and it isn\'t) then any other course change only makes things easier.

Passive, although it seems irrelevant. If one arrives after the other, its
passive sensors would detect the first ship before the first ship\'s passive
sensor did.

The assumption is usually that you find ships with passive and shoot at them
with active, although I\'m not sure if you really not active sensors at all for
some things.

I was trying to be helpful to the missile. If you evade randomly, whilst it is
possible that that for the time between my sensor pulse and my weapon pulse
you would be evading at 50G in one direction, it is also possible that half
way through the time you would change direction, possibly going back the
way you just came. I could try and do the sums for the probability of where
you will end up for a truly random evasion (of direction and duration),
given mean burn duration and estimated turning rates, but since the value
I gave is the *best* you can theoretically do, and it\'s not enough, why
bother?

It\'s not their ROF. The US Navy\'s Close In Weapons System (?) has an ROF
a hundred times greater than the ROF of the FS Signature PDL.
Despite this it would be effectively useless against a Traveller KKM.
The bullets are too slow and by the time the missile was too close to miss,
the defending ship would be unable to avoid the wreckage hitting like
a multikiloton nuke.

As Bruce Macintosh has pointed out before:

	a) if KKMs could hit, it would break all Traveller combat systems.

A KKM doesn\'t do "1d6 damage", it does "you\'re dead, no armour save" even
against million ton battlewagons. (Something that fires a million shotgun
pellets from 10,000km is a bit different, but I didn\'t think you were
referring of those.)

	b) lasers always hit.

Okay, if I\'m on the Earth and you\'re on the Moon pulling several G in random
directions, then not always, but early in the next century, when F15s meet
laser armed 747s, then kill rate = ROF. (At least until the laser breaksdown.)

<snip>

The assuption is that the thrust is all at the back and that the ship
changes facing.

A CT (or MT?) revision for thrusters is to allow them to act at 25% efficiency
at 90deg (eg to hover) and 10% efficiency at 180deg (ie to go backwards or
stop).
In T4, you could achieve the same effect of landing a ship like a 747 with
some cheap contragrav, so IMTU I just have engines pointing backwards and
make the PCs point the ship in the right direction.

Perhaps, if the gravity you were resisting were strong enough, the

I remember seeing a report about a year ago about this topic. All I
write is from memory, so I don\'t remember the details.

A russian scientist in the Netherlands worked on a University project
that had to with super conductors.
They had a metal disk cooled down to approximately 0 K or very close to
it. It was held in place by magnetic force (effectively levitating)and
spinning. When the scientist and a colleague went up to next story of
the building to have a talk with someone else (a pipe-smoking
scientist) they noticed by chance that the smoke evaded an area in the
room. Before entering this small area, it went upwards, thereby
leaving this area smokeless. They wondered what would cause this
effect, till they noticed that this room was exactly above their own.
They measured it and found out that the smokeless area was directly
above the disk and had the same size.
From this they concluded that the disk somehow shielded gravity by a
very small amount (IIRC, about 2-3%).
NASA got a hint on this and started a research project in cooperation with
a US University (I don\'t remember the name, but I think it was next to
NASA headquarters).

I think this could have a rather serious impact on space travel.
By building a large mystically-reducing-gravity device, you could
generate a low-gravity corridor that would make spacecraft much easier
to launch/increase spacecrafts cargo capacities, therefore making
space travelling a lot cheaper (always assuming that one day we will
be able to reduce gravity by a much larger amount than the 2-3%
observed in the experiment).
By building a large mystically-reducing-gravity device, you would also
generate huge amounts of air movement. Upwards. Probably all the air would
do a space trip as well.

I\'ll see if I can find some more info on the net.

I followed the description/calculations of the warp speeds given in the
Technical Manual for the Enterprise.
As such, the following information was derived. Please correct me if I
am wrong.

Speed		Times Speed Of Light	
Standard Orbit	0.00000894698958701	
Full Impulse	0.25	
Warp 1.0		1	
Warp 2.0		10	
Warp 3.0		39	
Warp 4.0		102	
Warp 5.0		214	
Warp 6.0		392	
Warp 7.0		656	
Warp 8.0		1,024	
Warp 9.0		1,516	
Warp 9.2		1,649	
Warp 9.6		1,909	
Warp 9.9		3,053	
Warp 9.99	7,912	
Warp 9.9999	199,516	
Warp 10		<Infinite>	

Warp speed was then compared to distance vs. time. Jump speeds were
calculated based on one week of jump time covering one parsec (3.2616
Light Years).
I am not saying that this is canon, I just based the calculations on
information provided.

Urm - no they aren\'t.  Iodine crystals are made up of individual iodine
molecules.  Xenon crystals are made up of individual xenon atoms.
Carbon crystals may be made up of individual carbon molecules (e.g.

I don\'t think you understood my arguments, or the mathematical subtleties
within.

General Relativity is a classical field theory. Force is a Newtonian
concept, and doesn\'t even enter into the equations that I qualitatively
described. Talking about force within the concept of the general metric is
nonsense.

The spacetime metric is a potential field, from which the affine connexion
is constructed, leading to the geodesic parametrized in proper time.

>All we need is a force that can affects individual particles equally,

Your concept of force is in error. All forces are low-energy manifestations
of gravity, and are curvatures in space. Fundamentally, there are four:
strong nuclear, weak nuclear, electromagnetic, and gravity. Of them, only
gravity affects everything equally.

Provided the substance is ferromagnetic. How well does it work on plastic?

Unfortunately also false. Any postulated fifth force would have to freeze
out very close to Planck time -- that is, when the universe was highly
energetic and dominated by photons. You would have to create such
conditions again to see it. Fifth forces are fringe science anyways, but
you\'re free to postulate what you like.

Early in the history of the universe, gravity itself acted contrary to its
current nature -- during the hyperinflation epoch. However, for us to
generate these conditions we again need to reach those energy levels:
probably several TeV per particle, or directly manipulate the stress energy
tensor.

>What this mystery force could be, I have no idea. But it doesn\'t have

Incorrect. See above. For example, if you think the Higg\'s boson mediates a
brand new antigravity force, fine. But you\'ll have to create Higg\'s bosons
by the truckload, and they are very energetic and shortlived particles.
You\'ll also have to figure out how to make them propagate any distance.

First, this is not necessary, for the most part spacetime is already
Minkowski; ie General Relativity is linearized such that Special Relativity
applies.

Second, it would not gain you anything. The only place this might apply is
near a black hole, in which case you might as well try to make a wormhole
with the event horizon.

Again, to do any sort of engineering on the metric by whatever means you
want: tachyons, bosons, magnets, handwave force, what-have-you; you must
manipulate the stress energy tensor per the General Relativity field
equations, which requires significant amounts of mass-energy.

For example: Miguel Alcubierre postulated a possible spacewarp. However,
some calculations suggest that more energy than is available in the entire
universe may be needed to recreate it. (I\'m waiting for a more recent paper
that may indicate otherwise in General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology)

With that in mind, I\'d like to ask a "favor":

Adam, with your grasp of physics, could you point us towards the
gaps in theory where a low-energy antigravity force/technique might
lurk? We already *know* antigrav is "impossible" with current
Earth science...how about some thinking about how it could be
possible? You\'ve evidently put some thought as to the obstacles - what
unknown or partially understood areas of physics exist that could,
if current guesses are wrong, allow workable antigravity?

From such thinking comes the best speculative fiction.

 My original blueprints and Technical Manual are out of reach at the moment, 
but the blueprints for the 1701-A (Movies 1-6) Enterprise give the following 
numbers:


  Overall Length  304.8m
 Overall Draft    71.3m
 Overall Beam    141.7m

 Saucer Length   146.3m
 Saucer Draft     32.9m
 Saucer Beam     141.7m (diameter)

 Secondary Len.  121.0m
 Seconrary Draft  47.5m
 Secondary Beam   32.9m

 Nacelle Length  154.8m
 Nacelle Draft    18.3m
 Nacelle Beam     12.6m

 The 1701-A was slightly stretched from the TOS version, but the numbers are 
close enough.

Volume of an ellipsoid is 4/3*pi*r1*r2*r3

r1 and r2 are 1/2 length and 1/2 width, r3 is 1/2 height.  I would have
expected the saucer to be perfectly round, but lets use the numbers above.

Vol=4/3*pi* 73m * 16.5m * 71m (I\'m rounding for simplicity).
That\'s about 358,000 m^3.

> Secondary Len.  121.0m
> Seconrary Draft  47.5m
> Secondary Beam   32.9m

I\'ll use the modified formula for the volume of a cylinder, since,
unexpectedly, the height and width of the secondary hull are not the same.

An ellipse area is pi*r1*r2 where r1 and r2 are half the width and height.

pi*24*16.5 = 1244 x length (for a cylinder) of 121 =
about 150,000m^3

> Nacelle Length  154.8m
> Nacelle Draft    18.3m
> Nacelle Beam     12.6m

Now the two nacelles, as above;

pi*9*6.5*155=28,500m^3 times 2 is

about 57,000 m^3

Total of 565,000 m^3 or 40,000 tons.  A tad smaller than I thought, but
pretty close to a "good" number for a 300 person crew.

I used that number to make an MT Consitution class.  Of course, with no
shields, phasers, photon torpedos, etc I had to improvise;  using TL17, I
put in 2 100 ton disintegrators to simulate phasers, one 100 ton meson to
simulate photon torps, and a few other items.

It\'s just for fun anyway.

	Simple ... it was a canon speed. In "classic Trek" (way back when I
was paying 50 cents for a paperback book), effective speed was warp
number cubed. Then somewhere along the line in TNG (and I\'m not into
it enough to remember where or why), they decided to change it to an
asymptotic function with Warp 10 as the limit.

	ObTrav: Well, lessee, the displacement ton changed size from CT to
MT and back again for TNE (14m^3 to 13.5m^3 and back), jump fuel
usage changed from CT to MT to TNE to T4, plasma/fusion weapons for
space combat went away for TNE, as did puny 50kg missiles as any kind
of threat, maneuver capabilities changed significantly between MT and
TNE, jump torpedoes were canon in an early version of CT, appeared in
one adventure, and then disappeared until TNE, antigravity thrusters
lost their ability to generate thrust when they became contra-grav in
TNE, and only got part of it back in T4, sensor ranges jumped from
TNE to T4, ....

	Has anybody thought of writing a "Nit Picker\'s Guide to Traveller?"
Or at least collating such inputs?

	Original FF&S was written for TNE. FF&S 2Ed was written for T4. As
the co-author, my completely unbiased and neutral opinion is that the
best is an amalgam of both, as 2Ed suffers from typographical errors
and lack of playtesting. However, it\'s got some pretty neat features
(mostly related to spaceships and vehicles in general) of which I\'m
pretty proud.

  According to the ST:TNG Technical Manual and various other sources of 
treknobabble, the Federation ships, at least, use a fairly low thrust, 
high-efficiency plasma/fusion drive as "Impulse" engines. The Warp Drive is 
indeed a form of StutterWarp that multiplies the small real thrusts of the 
impulse engines into motion that the rest of the universe regards as 
superluminal.   Most of the big ships don\'t have enough REAL thrust to escape 
a serious gravity well, and are thus pretty much toast if they lose the warp 
drives. Recall how slow the Enterprise-E was moving inside the "nebula" in 
ST:Insurrection, not to mention both ships being virtual slaves to orbital 
mechanics in Wrath of Khan...

>"  And this is just the drives wait till I ask about the weapons. 

 The god-like nature of ST sensors and countermeasures render space combat 
nearly useless beyond visual range. My impression is that the weapons pay for 
their superluminal capabilities by being very short-ranged as well. Otherwise 
they are lasers and extremely agile AM warhead missiles. In Traveller terms, 
Star Trek ships are vastly more maneuverable but very short-ranged.
 Shields can, with a little subterfuge, be treated like White Globes.

   I heard it while watching the evening news, however, www.startrek.com

"Star Trek fans the world over today mourn the passing of DeForest
Kelley. Mr. Kelley died today at the Motion Picture Country Hospital.

			Goodbye, Dr. McCoy 

                       by Joal Ryan
                       June 11, 1999, 3:15 p.m. PT 

                       DeForest Kelley, who as Star Trek\'s folksy
                       spaceman Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy frequently
                       issued the dire (and trademark), "He\'s dead, Jim,"
                       diagnosis, died today at the Motion Picture and
                       Television Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills,
                       California. He was 79. 

                       Kelley was pronounced dead at 12:15 p.m. Longtime
                       friend and producer A.C. Lyles told reporters the
                       star had been confined to the hospital for three
                       months, suffering from a "lingering illness." 

                       Kelley is the first major member of the USS
                       Enterprise\'s original on-air crew to pass away.
                       Franchise creator Gene Roddenberry died in 1991.
                       Actor Mark Lenard, a familiar face in the series
                       and movies as Mr. Spock\'s Vulcan father, died in
                       1996.

The numbers Clifford is using come from The Next Generation Tech Manual.
The formula (warp factor)^3 gave you the FTL for the old series. When Next
Generation came out they decided that warp speeds need to be faster they
came up with a new formula. The new formula has never been released but
people have made guesses based the numbers on the chart.

With that .sig, you have to be One of Us.  Go to the donut place directly
northwest of where you are sitting right now.  Point to an eclair, and say
"Gimme a Pepperoi Pizza."  Sit at the table closest to the employee door,
and hum something classical.  We\'ll be in contact.

Would a battle-rider\'s crew have permanent quarters aboard the

battle-rider carry?

If the crew of battle-riders normally quarter aboard the tender, do the

effective than battleships include the potential need for dual quarters
for the crew?  Also, how much fuel do battle-riders carry in such a

If, OTOH, battle-riders provide the quarters for their crew for extended
periods of time, do the calculations allow for extended operations (more
than two weeks [Standard life support])?  After all, AuricTech normally
designs warships with a 26-week food endurance, and Extended life

system ton-for-ton superiority over battleships?

Either way, are battle-riders as good a deal in post-CT versions as they

 The extra 5 meters is due to the Impulse Engines protruding slightly from 
the rear of the saucer. The saucer IS circular aside from that...

For those who think Trek isn\'t applicable to Traveller, I would point out 
that the ST:TNG deckplans for the Enterprise-D (yes, they exist) make a 
pretty good space station. So do the original set for the TOS Enterprise. I\'m 
still waiting for someone to do a proper plan for DS9\'s Promenade, though.

        I have the "Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology, and given the
dimensions and picture therein was able to deduce that the ST:TMP Enterprise
was ~62500 HG dtons.  Further, presuming that antimatter reduces power-plant
size by 50% and jump-fuel by 85% (arbitraty plucked-from-air figures that
myself and my group agreed to) and extending the missle USP table to H to
allow for photon-torpedoes and treating phaser arrays as a spinal meson and
several dozen PAWs bays, it was  a mean little ship.  I also hand-waved that
photon torpedoes are not susceptible to nuclear dampners and recieved a -6
on the damage result table (ala nuclear weapon).  Given that a single
torpedo was USP A, however, this functionally equiv\'d to a nuclear weapon
with DM-12...  Iiiiick.  About an even fight for a Tigress.

        The ST:ISFS Excelsior worked out to ~85,000 HG dtons, and was as
mean as the day is long.  In a straight-out fight, Excelsior beat Enterprise
4/5.

        The ST:WOK Reliant worked out to ~30,000 HG dtons, IIRC, and I could
not reproduce its combat effectiveness based on the movie.  Khan\'s,
therefore, intitial sucesses could only be accounted by firing from his
surprise postion and treating the Enterprise as being effectively "in
reserve" with shields down for the first combat round.  At which point she
behaves like an egg with a hammer.

        And, yes, I did have waaaaaay too much time on my hands in high-school.

        Yes, it would.  However, the problem you get into is that the engine
size and fuel requirements do not follow the correct progression either.  I
don\'t think you could *build* your +16 KE-K warhead if they were done
correctly.  The other issue is the arbitrary cap on fusion and fission
warhead sizes.  Given that, IIRC, detonated a 50+ Mt device in the late 60\'s
(and scared themselves silly in the process), I don\'t understand why space
weapons wouldn\'t be in the 100Mt range and up....

        However, in a CT game, its a great way to scare players....

        Impules engines are actually "Nuclear Impulse Engines".   Basically
laser-crushing deturium reactor with a nozzle for the blast to escape to
produce thrust.  Instead of a sustained burn, it works like a pulse jet
engine...  rate of feed of the deturium pellets regulates speed.

kilometeres...  =)

        No problem...  I ran this sort of a game in the late \'80s...  see my

This depends on the type of bond forming the lattice. If the forces are
covalent than it is a single large molecule (by definition).

If they are something else (e.g. electrostatic or hydrogen bonding) then
they are a crystal. 

So:

Diamond is covalent so a big molecule, graphite is layers of macromolecules
electrostatically attracted to form a laminate type structure (not quite
either), Ice and table salt are held together by hydrogen bonding and
electrostatic bonding (repectively) and so are not monomolecular.

Mono-edged weapons I always assumed were specially grown crystals of diamond.

Mono-filament is a mystery, perhaps a coiled bundle of strands of a plastic
like poly(acetylene)... (PolyAc is very ammusing in its properties, it is
totally ridgid until a small ammount of a halogen is introduced, then it
becomes conductive and ductile, when the halogen is removed from the
atmosphere it becomes ridgid in its new shape.).

Theres an idea, the filament is kept in a tape measure type dispenser with
a trace of chlorine in it, it is flexible when dispensed but becomes ridgid
within 5 minutes. My PCs could have lots of fun with that ;-)

        I\'ve gotta proof read before I post...  what I meant to say was TOS

I\'ve tended to go the other way in my GT designs.  I build them with full
living spaces, but without the luxuries (no theaters, etc.).  Those go in
the tender (including the swimming pool :-)  the tender does get the
long-term maintenance modules, but barring the need for new spare parts,
the riders are fairly autonomous.

My logic is this:

1) the time it takes to move crews from tender to rider and prep the ship
for launch could be tactically significant in a few cases

2) they may end up spending several weeks patrolling a system, sometimes
dispersed from their tender

3) some riders might be used as flagships of planetary navies, call it a
strategic reserve for the IN. (I think I got that idea here.  Anyone
remember it?)

It doesn\'t seem to compromise performance much.  Swapping all the
staterooms for half as many bunkrooms typically buys less than 0.1 g of
acceleration or a 2% increase in armor.

FF&S supports TNE
FF&S2 supports T4

In theory FF&S2 has some improvments to the design sequences,
I also find it a bit easier to use, especially with Andy Akins
spreadsheet.
However...
FF&S2 suffers from lots of errata, especially the formulae
(what did you expect, it is an Imperium Games product)
but all this can be downloaded from the net.
FF&S has lots of pages of text explaining stuuf and giving
the background to tech. IMO it\'s a much better read and still
a great Traveller reference, even if you never design a single
thing.
FF&S also has more support for varient technology, ie stuff
only used by Traveller Heretics.

I think that there is a lot to be gained by making the riders self
contained ships:

They are interchangeable, you can use the latest designs on older tenders.

You can use them for extended scouting and system patroll operations.

They can double as heavy SBDs, instantly meaning that there will be lots
of them around (so volume production benefits), every TL15 shipyard
will have lots of experience maintaining them, after you lose one lot
you can call at the nearest planet, collect half a dozen SDBs and be back
in action.

Indeed, it has been theorised that the adoption of a 20kt battle rider
would be the main driving force behind the design of 25kt SDBs by
planetary governments. :-)

Against this, I\'m sure there are some slight benefits in making them
limited duration. Not under High Guard though (unless you define
limited duration as one day and do away with the staterooms altogether
or have hot bunking, neither of which is allowed by the rules.)

Best Books and Games in Liverpool, UK, has just got a lot of new stock (2nd

They have all the rules versions from CT to MT to TNE, plus some T4.

CT material - Rulesbooks 1 through 5, Most Adventures, a lot of JTAS
issues, Most Digests post 14 (I bought the rest), a selection of
supplements, Striker box set, a selection of Gamelords material.
MT material - Nearly all books by GDW including folio adventures, all MT
Journals.
TNE - looked like most things.
plus a copy of 2nd Ed Imperium (GBP20, USD would be 30 ish).

Most of this seemed near mint.

The copy of Invasion Earth (GBP18) I bought had a few counters punched out
in ziplock bags, but was otherwise mint, as were the other books (Nomads of
the World Ocean, Bk 8 Robots).

They do do mail order and are on email at cardvark@hotmail.com

Hope this is of interest

    'body' => 'The inclusion of jump masking in the OTU (GT and T5) adds a significant amount
of time to each journey (on average).  This is very inconvenient to the shipping
companies - time is money.  The cost is passed on to the shippers and customers.
This in turn leads to uneven demand for the shipping services, leading to
over-capacity at one time of year and under-capacity later in the same year. Add
this on top of seasonal demands for trade and you get a chaotic system. This is
bad for business and bad for trade.  

Standard economics says reduce the price and demand will rise - even out the
flow and prices will fall as costs will be more manageable. As trade is the
lifeblood of the 3I everyone stands to gain from an increase in trade flows.

Shipping companies will try and find strategies to avoid the effects of jump
masking. A couple of obvious ones are:

1) Schedule irregular visits to masked systems to coincide with mask minima. 
This requires over-capacity in the system and may not tie in with local needs. 
This leads to conflicting requirements between shipping companies and their
customers.

2) Schedule long-distance trade to flow along different routes at different
times of year to minimise jump masking.  This is logistically very difficult to
do, as one systems mask minima may coincide with the next systems mask maxima. 
Add to this the uncertainties of the schedule due to uncertain jump times and
this is logistically very difficult indeed.  Again this requires over-capacity
in the system.

So it seems that there is only a relatively small gain to be made from avoidance
strategies.

So looking instead at acceptance strategies, Far Trader suggests carrying
Lighters, or rendezvousing with Lighters to reduce this time. [Small ships to
ferry crew, cargo, passengers and fuel between main world & the jump points.]

I have come up with two additional methods so far that offer improved time &
cost savings over the use of Lighters: Free Ports and Drop Freighters.

Free Ports: Establish a very high high-port just beyond the stars 100D limit
that is not masked with respect to any system that it trades with (i.e. it is
"free" of masking). It is a rare system indeed where this is not possible. Place
it as close to the main-world as possible and make its position freely
available.
 
Benefits: Shippers get a standard shipping price all year round.
Shipping companies get a much-reduced time between jumps - leading to many more
jumps per year, ships require a smaller m-drive - increasing cargo space.  (The
m-drive is only needed to match velocities with other systems). Both of these
lead to more profit.
The 3I sees an increase in trade flows.

Shippers, shipping companies and the 3I alike would support this. Shipping
companies would probably even agree to pay part of the cost of the free port. 
On a high volume route they may even establish their own.  Any system that was
eager to trade, or depended on trade to survive, should be very willing to
construct one. If there are multiple outposts in a system, the first one to
develop a free port would have a competitive edge.

Disadvantages: Fuel charges are higher (750 Cr/DT). Increased lighterage fees
for transits to the main world have to be paid (40Cr/DT). Both of these reduce
the shipping companies profit, but overall they are way ahead of the previous
situation.

Drop Freighters: To maximise profits you need to maximise jumps per year, which
means reducing time in-system (i.e. loading and unloading time and time spent
manouvering). Also the most expensive part of the ship is the jump drive - this
is the part you need to make best use of.  So why not have a separate jump drive
and freighter section. 

No longer do you need to spend ages manouvering down to the high-port, sitting
idly in port while cargo is unloaded & loaded, and then manouvering back to the
jump point.  You jump in, drop off the inbound freighter section, dock with the
outbound freighter section, match velocities with the target system, and jump
out.  Total time in-system less than 8 hours.  Total jumps per year around 48! -
At least for the jump drive section.

So instead of using lighters to take your cargo down to the main-world, the
entire cargo & fuel section of your ship is the lighter.

Your start-up costs are greater because you need to buy multiple cargo sections
for each jump section (one in each system and one in jump). However cargo
sections are relatively cheap. The expensive bits are the jump drive and to a
lesser extent the fuel tanks.  So overall you are ahead of the game.

the ship, we free it up to carry on jumping. 

Simply drop the inbound freighter off, connect to the outbound freighter, and
jump.  The freighter ambles down to the high-port, unloads, loads, fuels, &
ambles back up to the jump point, taking a leisurely 13 days to do so. So not
only does it make more money but logistically it is a dream too.

Yes, you have to buy three freighter sections for every jump section. Yes, your
initial investment is higher, but your return on that investment is also
significantly higher. Take a good look at the design and the illustrative
economics, we know you will be impressed.

These ships are designed specifically with the needs of the established shipping
corporations in mind.  On established routes these ships can increase your
margins significantly. They are strictly for the big boys in shipping.  Free
traders need not apply.

  I\'d suggest a normal starship quarters allocation (and none on the tender
for those rider crews), otherwise the riders are hosed not only if their
tneder buys it (which is a real possibility) but even if prolonged in-system
operations are envisaged. It also prohibits rider strategic deployment sans
tender by any method.

        Firstly, I apologize for the cross-posting, particularly to vampires.

        I am hacking away at my TNEC milieu again and am working on
encounter tables and maintainance system there-for for starships.  The idea
is that I want the odds of a given ship being encountered actually to have
some basis on the number of that class of ship actually in existance.

        Now, here\'s what I am trying to figure out....  from the moment that
a design stops production and the last one glides out of the spacedock, how
long till they\'re all gone from accidents, actions or old age?  Given that
the amortization period for a loan on a starship is 40 years, there would
seem to be some presumption in the 3I that a ship will live that long.  I am
trying to work out an "erosion percentage" that I can apply to the total
number of ships in a given class in peace-time and say "this many are no
longer in service this year".

        How is everyone else doing it?  Or is no one else worrying about it?  =)

        What I am premising on is that after 40 years peace-time operations,
75% of  ships will still be in operation.  For every 5 years after the first
40, 75% of ships are still in operation.  In "old" millieu like the 3I, it
would be concievable to have 100 or 150 year-old starships for a
monsterously mass-produced design.  Does my failure/ survial rates seem high
or low?

        Can someone with a better grasp on math than I have figure out what
the formula would be to come up with the results I am looking for on a
yearly scale....  So that each year of the first 40, enough ships are out of
service that at the end of 40 iterations 25% of the original number are OOS?
And then a like variant for the subsequent 5-year scale.  I\'d really
appreciate it.

        I am getting VB6 next week, and once I have these formulae, I think
I\'ll be creating an admin program to handle this and draw up encounter
tables automagically.  Otherwise, keeping track of 25-odd ship classes is
going to get annoying.

Pardon me for asking such an elementary question, but what, exactly,
does "Ph" mean?  In my Chem book, I find the usual highschool chemistry
Ph chart with H2O having a value of 7 (neutral) on the 14 point scale --
with everything below 7 being a progressively more corrosive acid, and
everything above 7 being a progressively more caustic base.  Is "Ph" a
term that assumes Earth atmosphere/characteristics, or does H2O simply
move +/- from neutral on the same scale, if present in a non-terran atmosphere?

pH is an acronym for "potential Hydrogen"; as far as I can tell, pH is
not Terracentric.  Simply put, pH measures the level of positive
hydrogen ions (hereafter H+) in a solution.  It is an exponential scale,
with pH 1 equalling a concentration of H+ of 1 x 10^-1, and pH 14
equalling a concentration of H+ of 1 x 10^-14.  The greater the
concentration of H+ (low pH numbers), the more acidic a solution is. 
The lower the concentration of H+ (high pH numbers), the more basic
[alkaline] a solution is.  Pure water has a pH of 7 (1 x 10^-7 H+), and
is considered "neutral."  The larger the deviation from this level, the
more corrosive/more caustic the solution is.

ObTrav:  If modern Terran industry is any indication, then industrial
taints in an atmosphere will tend to cause lower pH levels in
precipitation and subsequently in bodies of water (a.k.a. "acid rain"). 
This can lead to all sorts of fun, as PCs have to deal with the
increased wear and tear on their equipment, as a result of exposure to
acids (apparently, there have been instances of acid precipitation in
North America with pH levels approximating those in human stomach
acids).

Maybe. We know that "giant molecular clouds" have quite complex

pH is the logarithm of the concentration of free hydrogen ions (or
something like that) in a solution.

It\'s not going to be affected by atmosphere. Though atmospheric gases
dissolving into the solution may affect the pH by changing the chemical
composition. 

For example a strong alkali solution exposed to a CO2 atmosphere would
get weaker because because as CO2 dissolved into the water, it\'d create
carbonic acid (HCO3) which would react with the alkali forming water
and a carbonate salt. 

Example: NaOH + HCO3 -> NaCO3 + HOH (ie sodium carbonate and water)

Crystals can be formed from covalent bonds (e.g. diamond).  I was
correcting the error that crystals of elements are one big molecule,

The term "pH" was first coined by the Danish chemist Sorenson in 1909.
It refers to the negative logarithm (base 10) of hydrogen ion
concentration in a solution. (German, Wasserstoffionenexponent ; pH=
"potenz hydrogen").

However, it is now defined as :-
pH = -log [aH]
where a is the activity coefficient of hydrogen in the solution being
studied (some things don\'t completely dissociate in real solutions,
including \'hydrogen ions\' - which are actually charged complexes of
water).

To make things more interesting, pH 7 is not necessarily the neutral
point of water. It is temperature dependent ; at 293K, pN (the pH of
neutrality, where [OH-] = [H+]) is 7. At 310K (37 degrees C) it is 6.8.

In clinical medicine, it has been observed that for every degree Celsius
change in body temperature, the neutral point shifts 0.015pH units -
lower pH with higher temperatures, etc. This is an empirical finding and
similar rules may apply to solutions less complicated than intracellular
and extracellular fluids!

This is more difficult in the general case than it sounds. (If you knew the
geometry, a particular solution might be possible. In Traveller, without
knowing the 3D relationships of the systems, it is impossible to make very
many valid assumptions.)

As the number of objects to be unmasked goes up, the distance from the
primary goes up geometrically -- the cross-sectional area of the primary\'s
100D limit is a constant in the calculations. Moreover, the distance from
the "free port" [not a good name, by the way -- the term already has a
technical definition -- try "far port"], which is more-or-less fixed with
respect to the stars (less proper motion) and the mainworld, which is still
in orbit around the primary, will vary by several AU\'s throughout the year. 

For transient traffic (passing through the system) this is not a factor;
for traffic originating or terminating in the system, the transit time from
a freeport is increased enormously. This discourages mixed loads -- some
transient cargo, plus a drop-off and pick-up at each stop along the way --
and leads to the same sorts of capacity mismatches that you were trying to
avoid. You would also have to recalculate lighterage and fuel delivery
tariffs: those were based on a port in high planetary orbit, not several
AU\'s away from the mainworld.

Drop freighters are reasonably sound in theory, but they suffer from the
same problems of geometry: one must either have two jump/breakout points,
for the inbound and outbound legs respectively, and transit between them
(which takes time) or one must put the jump/breakout point well away from
the mainworld to avoid both masks simultaneously. They are also not
compatible with mixed-destination loads. [Jim proposed this system early in
the writing of Far Trader, and I convinced him that LASH makes more sense.]

That\'s not to say that they won\'t work, or that you can\'t use these
solutions. The systems presented in Far Trader were extensively playtested,
criticized, and defended, however, and seemed to be the best available.

It was the TNE era I was wondering about.  I didn\'t like the timeline for

Constructed in orbit in the late 1090s, Matt Gross Orbital is Lunion\'s
pride.  Built entirely with local assets, the gigantic sphere handles
thousands of passengers and hundreds of tons of cargo on a weekly basis.

The design is simple.  Around the "waist" of the station are a variety of
docking bays, grapples for larger vessels, and docking umbilical.  Each of
the primary bays can accommodate ships up to 1000dt, although a rule of
thumb for multiple ships is to knock of 50dt of capacity for every
additional ship in the bay.  Thus, you could safely put four free traders
in the same bays and still have room for routine operations.  Ships between
1000 and 5000 dt use the grapples.  Ships larger than 5000dt cannot dock
with the station under normal circumstances, and have to make arraignments
to use small craft for their interface needs.

Once inside the station, the visitor is offered any number of business and
recreation opportunities.  The four large shopping plazas carry duty-free
merchandise from throughout the subsector.  There are many restaurants and
clubs where one can sample a variety of cusines (The _Iron Chef_ on level
38, Blue Sector is recommended for the adventurous), and a large hotel
awaits those who just need to catch up on their rest.  The hotel is run by
the Holman chain, and accepts TAS memberships.

Order is kept by a 250 sophont police force.  MGO is a chartered
corporation under Lunion law, and has retained the right to operate an
independent justice system.  Those accused of violent crimes will be turned
over to planetary authorities for trial, but most minor offenses are dealt
with in-house with fines or short times in the brig.

Matt Gross Orbital is home to Lunion Orbital and System Control.  A vast
array of antenna covers the "poles" of the station, and ship owners are
advised that high energy emissions may damage sensitive equipment.  LOSC is
also the local office of the Imperial Grand Survey, and high-quality
navigation tapes and maps for most of the subsector can be found here.

Along with caring for the crews and passengers, MGO also has excellent
facilities for caring for the ships themselves.  50,000td of refined fuel
is kept available, and an on board processing plant refines raw fuel
brought in from the planetoid belt.  Sufficient repair and refit capability
exists to do annual maintenance on vessels up to 5000dt.

A fleet of 35 pinnaces shuttle between MGO and Lunion.  About half the
flights are to Gridlore Interstellar Starport near Mirrorsea, the capital
city, with the others going to Lunion\'s minor ports.  Scheduled service to
the other inhabited worlds of the system is based on the population of the
world and demand.

Isn\'t it kind of a waste to have to drag 630 spaces of Fuel Tank back to the
planet. Why not fit the Jump section with demountable Fuel Tanks. That way a
new Freighter section and new fuel tanks could be linked to the jump section
and it could jump.  The Freighter would not have to wait for it\'s tanks to
be filled and neither would the jump section. As opposed to putting the
tanks in the jump section.

Before anyone starts the drop tank thread again, these tanks would be
demountable, not disposable. They would jump with the ship. Such a design
would allow the Jump section to be moved without a freight section if
necessary.

However, the densities of the complex organic molecules in question are
so low that they meet each other only rarely - so any reactions take
place agonizingly slowly; so slowly there\'s no real chance of building up a
replicating molecule in the lifetime of the universe. This is one of the
reasons Hoyle disagreed with the Big Bang model - he wanted a universe
old enough (trillions of years) for life to evolve in Giant Molecular Clouds.

(Which led to his more exotic "germs from space" model, in which the
ever-changing common cold is brought to earth by cometary meteors...)

I realize that FTL in general breaks causality, but can anyone give an
example of how Traveller jump drives alone can break causality in a
macroscopic sense? By this I mean something like being able to travel back
in time, meet yourself, or create objects from nothing using only jump
drives?

Why do you like them? The reduced fuel usage will have canon-bending side
effects like making it possible for battle fleets to escape without
refuelling, and allowing ships to cross the Great Rift.

Not exactly, The TL 15 drives are built with TL 15 credits, and are
therefore much more expensive than TL 10 drives with the same performance.
This means that TL 10 starports can compete economically with TL 15 ones.

Accellerating faster. Movement speed only becomes relevant at rather close

Crew of *80*? According to the original series, the Constitution-class

This problem caused me several days of frustration. I couldn\'t do proper
conversion because PE gives no information on the size or composition of
its A,D, T, and J factors; only their cost in RU. IS waves at PE but gives
no information on how to relate PE\'s military budget to IS squadrons. 
I eventually decided to calculate the worlds\'s Military Size (PE p28), take
10% of that (rounded) as the base number of starship squadrons (IS p28)
instead of basing this on the number of SDBs, and price a Starship Squadron
at 1 TCr.  SDB squadrons I figured could go for 1 Billion Credits.
I also decided to ignore PE warfare rules and use IS instead, since that
level of detail fit what I wanted to do better.
YMMV.

Pocket Empires gives information on the size of a planet\'s
economy, including the military establishment. I use 10% of
military size times 1 Trillion credits as the approximate the cost of
jump-capable naval forces, and I would allow up to about 5% of the GWP for
annual civilian shipbuilding capacity in MCr.  Individual worlds vary.
  The economy and therefore spaceship building capacity of a world is more
sensitive to its population than to its TL or starport class. These have a
secondary effect.

Only if it is TL-17 or higher.  There has to be some advantage that higher
tech levels provide.  From the first tech level through TL 16, there is no
change at all in the required volume or the required fuel for jump drives,
only the fact that at higher tech levels, a larger drive (and corresponding
larger amount of fuel) will allow a greater jump distance.

I like the idea that higher levels of technology provide some benefit.
Otherwise, why continue investing in research after TL-15?

As to Canon, since there has not been any information posted on conflicts
between TL 17+ fleets, it is a moot point.  Tactics will have to evolve or
die.  Canon only covers up to Tl-16 (Vincennes and the Darrians).

If I have a factory on Terra (TL-15) build my drives, they had better be
built with Tl-15 components, designs, and know-how.  Five tech levels,
roughly the entire history of the 3I, and the only difference is if you
have the TL, and build a bigger drive which has a larger fuel requirement,
you can go farther.  The TL-15 J-1 drive is no different than the TL-10
J-1.  I find that hard to accept.  

But it is canon.

I can handle playbalance items when they make sense, this though, makes no
sense.

The best guess is on the Quantum Cavorite site:

http://www.inetarena.com/~noetic/pls/woodward.html

The work of James F. Woodward is better documented (that is, he has
actually published an experimental protocol unlike the Russian scientist)
and, to my view, more credible.

Mach\'s principle postulates that inertia results from the sum total
gravitational attraction on a given body by every other body in the
universe. The limiting case of Mach\'s principle according to James Woodward
(whose papers I have not yet reviewed) yields the familiar F=ma equation.

Woodward also uses a modification of General Relativity to change mass
fluctuation in an object by varying energy density in a capacitor. This
idea only works if Mach\'s principle is valid.

Woodward\'s device uses these two principles: by rapidly changing current
density in a capacitor, one can produce mass fluctuations. By vibrating the
physical position of the capacitators (via piezoelectric crystal) and
properly timing this vibration with mass fluctuation, it is possible to
produce a net force.

The thrust is proportional to the power supplied: ideal for Traveller purposes.

Woodward\'s latest results indicate his effect may be smaller than his 1996
experiment, and of course, the effect could still result from error
uncertainties. And of course, Mach\'s principle and his postulated mass
fluctuations have not been proven. It is, however, within the realm of
possibility.

>>From such thinking comes the best speculative fiction.

Agreed. Another way to provide an inertialess drive involves the use of
Negative matter, another not yet proven/disproven quantity that certain
physicists (eg Robert L. Forward) postulate for various effects. Negative
matter and its consequences for both FTL and time travel are well explained
in his book "Timemaster".

FTL travel = Time travel.

Simple example. With a detailed telescope, I observe what is happening now
upon the surface of a planet. (No quibbles about pefect optics or
atmospheric effects or uncertainty, please).

Using a Jump-2 drive, I jump two parsecs away and train my telescope upon
the planet again. Now I am observing what has happened upon the surface of
the planet ~ six years ago. I overhear the plans to blow up a certain
building six years in the future. I can then jump back to the planet and
foil the plans.

More complicated scenarios can be devised, but I hope this illustrates why
FTL =  Time travel and why causality becomes indeterminate.

I would think not far at all.  Since it\'s not under much pressure and
probably in a gaseous state, the residual hydrogen will burn nastily, but
probably wouldn\'t explode.  Think Hindenburg rather than Challenger.  It\'ll
be real impressive but a couple hundred feet away all you\'ll feel is heat. 


This actually came up on the Pyramid boards a while back, regarding a
Broadsword, but the idea is the same.

Whew ... where to begin?  When I first wrote this program, I did not 
envision all the different modules that would sprout up amongst all 
the gearheads out there.  Shame on me, but instead of just rewriting 
it when I saw what was happening, I tried to bang all the new 
modules into the basic system patterns.  Well, it didn\'t work.  So, I 
did what I should have done in the beginning.  This is a major 
overhaul and I have good news and bad news.

The Good News (gotta getcha hooked first):

- - Everything is now stored in the Repository.  This includes all 
systems from the basic building system on up to user definable 
systems.

- - Faster recalculations.

- - Improved printout.

- - Ability to lock the acceleration of multiple maneuver drive systems 
at the same time.

- - Optional Far Trader crew calculations per system.

- - Crew Requirements listing (also included optionally in printout) per 
system.

- - Software is now treated as a module just like all other systems.

- - Ability to add custom Weapon Turrets (not just the turret 
weapons).  Create turrets to house the TL9/11/13 weapons that 
have been created.

- - Ability to add custom Weapon Bays (not just the bay weapons).  
Create bays to house the TL9/11/13 bay weapons that have been 
created.

- - Ability to save and load different Repository files and import 
different ones.

- - Gunner Worksheet optional printed.

And the most major change: If you add a module to a ship, you 
don\'t have to have that module in the repository to view the stats on 
it anymore.  That always bugged me.


Now the bad news:
Your old repository files are not compatible with this version.
Your old ship files are not compatible with this version.

There were just TOO many changes to what I needed stored in the 
ship/repository files to even consider a conversion routine.  

However, if any of you want to save your old ship files, send them to 
me and I will dump them to a text file for you.  

OR

Save an old copy of GTS and run it at the same time as the new 
version.  Then you can see what needs adding.

Well, that about sums it up.  I hope I didn\'t make too many of you 
mad by this move but I think it will be better in the long run.

	Jump masking certainly creates logistical problems for shipping companies, but it\'s not 
clear that it needs to be a business problem.  First of all, there\'s no reason the lines can\'t 
charge a standard price all year that evens out the cost highs and lows over the course of the 
year.  IIRC, the average Trav world actually has a year shorter than a standard "calendar" year, 
so this is even easier.  Furthermore, it\'s not clear how price-elastic demand for shipping is.  
For non-bulk goods shipping costs are generally small relative to the cost of goods shipped.  
However, the bulk of trade (by volume), is bulk goods and these tend to be much more sensitive 
to shipping costs because of their lower value/volume.  Still, you have to compare the cost of 
shipping to the cost of carrying inventory and warehousing to hold the economy through the high-
cost shipping period.  As you\'ve pointed out elsewhere, the true cost of shipping (especially in 
GT) is the j-drive.  So if systems with high masking simply adopt a LASH system they can 
eliminate the great bulk of the costs by keeping the j-drive systems moving and absorbing the 
additional delays in the lighter system.  Since m-drive equipped ships are so cheap relative to 
j-drive ships, it\'s easy to add lighters.
	In short, I think jump masking is less costly than the "fixes" you\'re proposing.

	If this is the planet\'s only highport, then this makes for very long in-system transit 
times all year instead of just at certain points in the year.  Orbits being what they are, it\'s 
also not clear to me that you won\'t have times when the mainworld is "masked" with regard to the 
"freeport."  Transit time is expensive for the companies shipping goods as well as the shipping 
lines themselves because it forces them to carry more inventory, fix plans further in advance, 
etc.

<snipped "Drop Freighters">

	This is a lot like LASH except the fuel tanks are detachable as well and you have one 
giant lighter instead of many smaller ones.  This eliminates the advantage LASH ships have of 
being able to easily land lighters directly at the downport or sub-downport closest to the 
customer.  It also forces you to pay the high 30% of volume streamlining cost for the hull 
enclosing your fuel tanks, unless you want to restrict it to the highport which further limits 
the range of the ship.  Lighters are also handy because you can have many ship designs use the 
same lighter system.  The "mega-LASH" on big routes and the "mini-LASH" on small routes.  It 
also hurts when some of your cargo is "through" cargo destined for the next system.  On a LASH 
vessel you can put all of it in one lighter that stays on the tender whereas for drop freighters 
it has to waste several days go in-system and back out again.

Thanks John for you continuing exploration of the issues raised by Far Trader.  I know you\'ve 
already caught some important errata for us, and other things you\'ve raised will probably wind 
up in the "design notes" article (whenever we get around to that.)

Yes it is a waste to carry that expensive fuel tankage in the cargo section, but
I couldn\'t come up with a more economic option. I assumed that refuleing and
loading/unloading took place simultaneously, though refueling time is not a
major consideration. 

Are demountable tanks covered in GT? Are they any cheaper? You would have to pay
a premium to get them filled and/or delivered at/to the jump point. Hmmm, I will
have to try and work out the economics of this now.

This was the simplest & cheapest of the designs for this concept I came up with.
I wanted to see what criticisms the list came up with before I posted more
complicated versions.

Another design included internal tankage to allow the jump section to jump
alone, in case of misjump or attack (only needs 15 DT of fuel for J1). After all
its only 150DT but its very expensive and you wouldn\'t want to lose it (which is
why I armed it).

Note that the jump section could connect to two cargo sections and still do a
J1.

Another had a 2000 DT USL cargo section, and used a standard 800DT SL oiler as
the fuel tanks (i.e. a three part ship). The oiler is more expensive but can be
reused more often, and gets you nearly free fuel, or can earn revenue between
jumps. 

BTW is Drop-Freighter a good designation? I was afraid that it might be mistaken
for a Drop-Tank freighter. I also considered the term "Jump-Lighter".

Most worlds only trade directly with two or three others. If a particular
systems geometry is bad for a far-port then you place it so it minimises the
worst masking rather than eliminates it altogether.

I was assuming a moving far-port, that was kept as close to the main-world as
possible, whilst staying unmasked, and its planned position was freely available

Worst case I would have thought 1.4 (root 2) AUs, would be enough to reduce
masking to a minor irritant. A few Class A & F stars might be more troublesome,
which is where drop-freighters take over.

Local transit times are increased but shipping price is radically decreased (no
longer are you tying up of that expensive j-drive that normally costs you).
Shipping is also always available throughout the year as shipping companies
don\'t divert shipping during mask maxima. Swings & roundabouts - as we say in
the UK.

M-drive lighters have got to be cheaper than tying up the j-drive of a
mega-freighter.

Fuel would have to be very expensive indeed for this not to be more profitable.
And if it is then you run your own oilers in-system...

I was assuming either a milk run between two planets, or a through system with
the jump/breakout point well away from the mainworld to avoid both masks
simultaneously. The cargo section has 13 days to get down to the highport and
back.

With mixed destination loads, there is nothing to stop the inbound freighter
docking and transferring through-cargo to the outbound freighter whilst both are
accelerating to match target system velocity. I am sure I could come up with a
multi-hull design to transfer priority through cargo to the outbound freighter
and still make loads more money.

1. Anybody moving around is not injured (yet), your first concern is
tending to those not capable of moving themselves.

2. Collect and inventory your immediate resources.

3. Start triage.

a. Those who cannot be saved.
b. Those who can be saved with immediate treatment.
c. Those who will survive while you treat the others.

Since you have a number of uninjured persons, have them tend to the minor
injuries.

Just wanted to update folks on the eBay FIFTH FRONTIER WAR auction I have
going on, and a sale.

Firstly, there are only a few days left. And it\'s at $44. The copy is
*unpunched,* and even though the box shows some wear (there\'s a picture of
it at the site), the parts are near mint, and in GREAT condition.

But mostly, I just discovered I\'ll be out of town when the bidding closes.
So if folks can\'t get ahold of me, don\'t panic. :-) I\'ll be back Sunday
night from the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists convention.

Anyhoo, the auction page for FIFTH FRONTIER WAR can be found at:

http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=115098953

I\'m ALSO selling off my T4 collection: Marc Miller\'s Traveller (Main Rule
Book), Emperor\'s Arsenal, Pocket Empires, Anomalies, Psionic Institutes and
Long way Home. Rulebook VERY slightly used. All else in mint condition.
SRP: $129.75 All six books for $65, plus postage, or best offer.

Thanks,

John

Triage : French, "to sort".
Prioritise casualties according to the following criteria :-
- - those with life-threatening injuries that can be quickly stabilised
(e.g. airway obstruction, (haemo)pneumothoraces ; obvious profuse
haemorrhage) ;
- - those with injuries that can be treated in 10-30 minutes\' time
(compound fractures, cuts, etc.) ;
- - those with minor injuries ;
- - the dead and dying (i.e. decapitation, torso transections, etc.)

Obviously Tech Level may vary this a bit ; but the stipulation is that
this is a wilderness situation.

Approaching the individual casualty :-
A : Airway :- noisy breathing? facial or neck injuries? rapid, shallow
breathing?
B : Breathing :- equal air entry on both sides of chest? Sucking chest
wounds?
C : Circulation :- Obvious external bleeding sites? pulses? blood
pressure?
D : Disability :- level of consciousness? Obvious paralysis (hypertonic
or unduly stiff limbs, absent reflexes, etc.)?
E : Evaluate (the effects of interventions you have applied in steps A-D
above)

Never be afraid to delegate tasks to the walking wounded and the
ambulant ; there\'s probably just one medic to a lot of crew members!

I hope this is of some use.

It does make a twisted sort of sense if you assume jump drives are actually
monkey copies of TL21 artifacts, built in the Imperium in the same way that
TL3 artisans built monkey copies of parts for TL7 aircraft on the
North-West Frontier in WW2 (it amazed a bunch of aircraft mechanics, but
not the old India hands, that the locals were, with a hammer, a file and a
charcoal file, building parts that worked for the most modern aircraft the
Allies could build).

The other problem with making hi-tech worlds dramatically better at
everything is that if this was true, the development pattern of the 3I just
wouldnt happen.

Yeah, I know, the radical spread of TLs and industrial capability was
caused by random world generation, but if we have to make some sort of
sense of it all, then we must assume that those low stellar and down
industrial worlds have a viable economic niche.

Low jump starships are one of those niches.

Note that if the Imperium doesnt really, honestly, know how jump drives
work, then this could cause a very-well-compensated cultural inferiority
complex :)

Robert O\'Connor could probably answer this better, but there are two sorts
of triage - worst prospect first, and best prospect first.

The mechanic is the same in both cases. You split the injured into three
groups - the people who might die without assistance, those who will
probably die without assistance, and those who will die without assistance.

If you have lots of resources, the people in the worst category get
stabilised first, and then you work your way up the list until everybody is
saved.

If you dont, then you start with those with the best chance, and work your
way down. In all probability, the third group are going to get written off.

It wont be a die-in-a-ditch issue, given the amount of trade that goes thru

If the ship has used all of its jump fuel, the main problem is the
kinetic energy of the ship itself as it kisses the ground in an
uncontrolled manner.

The hydrogen fuel could be a minor component - and the ship\'s hull may
contain the blast depending on its armour value (a \'puny\' chemical
explosion - 28m3 LH2 is 140kg - in rough terms equivalent in energy to a
full tank of petrol in a light van or 4WD vehicle - say 1800-2000MJ or
thereabouts).

Convert the impact energy to TNT equivalents and use the appropriate
blast radii and damage values from GT/T4.

From the Canadian Military First Aid Manual
Emergency scene management (EMS) Multiple casualty management (Triage)
Priority 1 - Immediate (roughly 20% 0f casualties) requiring life-saving
medical intervention.
    Conditions;
        - airway and breathing emergencies
        - sucking chest wound and tension pneumothprax
        - severe shock
        - severe bleeding
Priority 2 - Early (roughly 20% 0f casualties) have serious, possibly
life-threatening injuries but are temporarily stable, good possibility of
survival, condition will not be compromised by short delay.
    Conditions;
        - major abdominal wounds
        - major vessel injuries requiring repair
        - closed cerebral injuries with increasing loss of consciousness
        - injuries with perceptibly increasing shock
        - open or complex fractures
        - major burns
Priority 3 - Routine (roughly 40% 0f casualties) may be serious,even
crippling, but so long as casualty is relatively stable, evacuation takes
place as transport becomes available.
    Conditions;
        - soft tissue wounds with less major muscle wounds
        - lesser fractures and dislocations
        - Maxillofcial injuries without asphyxia
        - combat stress reaction
        - minor burns
Priority 4 - Deferred (roughly 20% 0f casualties) casualties are usually
ambulatory. Conditions cover a range of minor injuries, none of which are
life threatening. In mass casualty situations Priority 4 include those whose
injuries are so serious that the probability of survival is remote.
Casualties in this latter group must not be abandoned. They should be
removed to a quiet area, and provided with as much comfort and support as
possible.

The process of triage
    Stabilize for transport, continue to provide first aid in order of
priority for all injuries and illnesses. Do not delay evacuation to medical
help in order to provide first aid for minor conditions.Continue to monitor
for changes in conditions and change priority for first aid and evacuation
accordingly. stay with casualties until they can be turned over to qualified
persons.

Triage Tags
    When a Crash Team responds to an emergency where there are multiple
causalities, they follow an established protocol for quickly assessing all
casualties.During the assessments, each casualty is tagged with a triage
tag.
    The colour-coded triage tags identify casualties to which of the four
priorities they fall into.Priority 1 Red, Priority 2 Yellow, Priority 3
Green, and Priority 4 Blue.  This helps the Crash Team treat and transport
the casualties according to their differentent levels of medical need.

2m3 LH2 is 140kg ; 28m3 is 1680kg, approximately 28000MJ.

A somewhat bigger explosion (radius about 3.5X larger).

I don\'t really buy this answer Adam, and looking at your home page, you are
just describing the problem incorrectly. Since you have signed off the list
though, you won\'t be able to reply to this :)

The real answer is at http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hinson/ftl/index.html

But the quick answer is that because time is different at different speeds,
when I fly past you at a relativistic speed, an event in my past might be
an event in your future.

I believe the whole paradox requires differences in speeds that aren\'t present
in stars within 6 parsecs of each other, and since ships in J-space are 
incommunicado there aren\'t really any problems in the Traveller concept of
jump space. 

I could be wrong. Please read the FTL FAQ yourself, and anyone can feel free
to comment on this: I am just a computer geek, not a physics geek.

Excuse my density but how does this violate causality? How is this any

I was expecting something like seeing a building blow up then use the jump
drive to go back in time and prevent it. Consequently, of course, I never
did see it blow up and so never went back in time...

So I have my time travelling weather satellite 6 light years from Earth.
In 2004 it jumps to Earth to report:

	"There\'s going to be a pretty bad hurricane in 1998"

Sounds like more use to the weather historians than the weather forcasters.

Didnt DGP introduce a race known only as "The Sparklers" which used 
bio-engineered ships? They were mentioned in the designer notes in MT 
Journal 4 (I think...)

They were a race who possessed incredibly powerful psionics... they used 
telepathy for communiction and Teleportation as a method of transport. Im 
not entirely sure on the accuracy of this as its been nearly two years since 
I picked up MT Journal 4!! :-)

	I have worried about it, but I don\'t remember what I 
	did about it.

"What I am premising on is that after 40 years peace-time 
operations, 75% of  ships will still be in operation.  For 
every 5 years after the first 40, 75% of ships are still in

concievable to have 100 or 150 year-old starships for a
monsterously mass-produced design.  Does my failure/ survial 
rates seem high or low?

Can someone with a better grasp on math than I have figure 
out what the formula would be to come up with the results I 
am looking for on a yearly scale....  So that each year of 
the first 40, enough ships are out of service that at the end 
of 40 iterations 25% of the original number are OOS? And then 
a like variant for the subsequent 5-year scale.  I\'d really
appreciate it."

	If the rate of attrition is constant for the first 40 
	years (they are all in pretty good shape, losses are
	mostly due to accidents, pir... um, unspecified losses,
	etc.), then to get 25% losses you need 99.283375% to
	\'survive\' each year: the proprtion surviving could be
	calculated by 0.99283375^(years). To get 25% losses for
	each 5 years after that (losses increase due to mechanical
	breakdowns), use 0.75 x 0.9440875^(years - 40). I would 
	not object to these levels, but they are a little higher 
	than I might use. Perhaps 0.9975^(years) for the first 40
	years (just over 90% survive to age 40), then 
	0.905 x 0.975^(years - 40) for the next 40 years (leaving
	about 33% at age 80), then 0.329 x 0.95^(years - 80) for 
	another 40 years (just over 4% still going at 120), and
	0.0423 x 0.9^(years - 120) until age 160 (leaving slightly
	more than 6 out of 10,000), and if a few have managed to
	persist: 0.000625 x 0.8^(years - 160) for another 40 (almost
	1 in 10^7 will still clunk along after 200 years).

	Hope this helps.

Yes, they can. I was merely pointing out that covalent crystals could
certainly be called monomolecular, especially within a work of fiction

Thats a great idea!

The only problem I can see is the possibilty of the wire not being to
flexible due to steric repulsion of the C60 balls, and a chain is only as
strong as it weakest link so a long "linker" could break.

Or how about using buckytubes for a wire. Again a linker is needed for
flexibility though......

	A couple of good posts already address this, but I\'ll 
	just add my cr. 0.02. This is a tough situation for any
	medical personel: appart from the impact of number of 
	injured and dying, the senior medical officer will have
	to quickly decide which patients are \'worth\' working on.
	As somebody pointed out, badly injured patients that 
	could be saved may be left to die so that three others
	are saved. Medical personel not trained for such 
	situations may waste time on the worst patients, or may
	\'showboat\' (consciously or unconsciously) by trying to
	save spectacularly injured individuals.

	The RW priorities of the first-aider are:
		1) Safe for me (I\'m no help to you if I\'m injured 
			or killed)
		2) Safe for you (get the patient out of danger, but
			be careful of spinal injuries)
		3) ABC (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)
		4) other conditions that may be life-threatening
			before long
		etc.
	In a triage situation, the first-aider will not initially 
	pass step 3 until all casualties have been assessed. Anybody
	who is yelling for help automatically has passed ABC (C 
	includes serious bleeding as well as heart function, but if 
	there is serious bleeding the yelling should stop shortly).
	The casualties should be rapidly assessed, possibly have their
	airways opened at the same time (or perhaps some other high-
	tech treatment that can be done quickly), then triaged and 
	treated.

However, the densities of the complex organic molecules in 
question are so low that they meet each other only rarely - 
so any reactions take place agonizingly slowly; so slowly 
there\'s no real chance of building up a replicating molecule 
in the lifetime of the universe. This is one of the reasons 
Hoyle disagreed with the Big Bang model - he wanted a universe
old enough (trillions of years) for life to evolve in Giant 
Molecular Clouds.

(Which led to his more exotic "germs from space" model, in which 
the ever-changing common cold is brought to earth by cometary 
meteors...)

	Further, biological evolution (as far as we know) proceeds
	mainly by natural selection. Natural selection requires that
	there be more than one organism (usually lots of them) all
	reproducing: the ones with the most effective form for 
	reproducing tends to supercede the others after numerous 
	generations. Thus, in order for a living nebula to evolve 
	by this mechanism, there would have to be many "giant 
	molecular clouds" capable of reproducing themselves.

Of course, this example does not violate causality at all.

I observe what is happening on the planet currently (in my frame of
reference, which is the same as the planet\'s in the Traveller universe).

I have perfect optics, clear weather, and am completely certain.

I jump 2 parsecs.

I observe the planet from there ...

And I see what happened more than six years ago (from my frame of
reference, which is *still* the same as the planet\'s), since it takes light
from the world more than six years to reach the point that I am at now.

I have no special knowledge about the future.

IIRC, every non-officer gets a small stateroom as standard. I don\'t
recall them being described as limited duration.

The hot bunking I referred to was more like 2-3 people per small stateroom
(one working, one sleeping, one doing "stuff").

Of course, those people from today\'s real navies probably wonder why the
3I "wimps" need so much personal space. ;-)

Wow! I had no idea there were this many races in the Spinward Marches. I
have no help for you on this, but many questions. I think it can all be
summed up with: Can you post your research on a webpage or send it to
me? If you don\'t have a webpage, I\'ll gladly host it for you. I am
currently working on a Traveller page that has it\'s main focus on the
Spinward Marches. This would be a wonderful addition!

Also, would anyone else on the list have data on the more obscure
Traveller races? We all know about the Aslan, Vagr, Droyne, Chirpers,
etc. But most of the races listed here I have never even heard of. And
does anyone have thoughts on alien biochemistry? I saw that the Rocket
Bike thread got into some detailed and highly educational discussion of
exotic, corrosive and insidious atmospheres, and this aspect of
Traveller seems to be glossed over in the canonical rules.

A silicon lifeform? Is this really possible? I know we here about it all
the time in Sci-Fi, but I thought silicon did not form complicated
enough molecules to  make this plausible. IIRC, I heard it would be more
likely to find carbon based life in an ammonia atmosphere or perhaps
methane. Any thoughts fellow Travellers?

is based on _native-grown_ tech - i.e., that the planet in
question discovers and implements the technology without outside
aid.

However, it\'s generally agreed that the technological capability
to maintain most technology is somewhat lower than that needed to
initially produce it.

At the higher tech levels, this distinction may not matter much -
but it could conceivably make a _big_ difference at lower tech
levels - which is where uplift operations would naturally be
concentrated, to bring a planet up to an industrial tech level.

Thus, the following question for discussion:

Given the constraint that you may not import examples of
technology for use, but may only import knowledge, how do you
start any of the following societies on the road to their
industrial age ahead of their \'natural\' schedule?

(note: don\'t assume that you\'re being dropped on Earth, with
historical personages available to you. Assume only compatible
technological, social, and internal political organizations.
Also, the job won\'t be completed in your lifetime - the idea here
is to give them a jump start, which they can then maintain based
on their capabilities at the time you introduce a particular
innovation. You will have the cooperation of the local
government, as long as you respect their authority and
prerogatives, and don\'t try forcing social changes too quickly.)

(note also: your industrial age need not follow the same pattern
as the historical IA; it merely must lead to results that are
_functionally_, in terms of niche-filling in society, the same.
Within those constraints, you may allow your prejudices in favor
or against various lines of development full play.  Your target
is based on technical evaluation, not social, so the ultimate
form of government is only as important as you make it. If you
use \'unusual\' technologies [e.g., Babbage Analytical Engines
instead of semiconductor-based computers], explain why, and how
you overcome the shortcomings that prevented their use in our
development.)

(Finally, if you\'re using ideas from SF, that\'s OK - just let us
know author and title, and ISBN if available.)

Society 1: Rome, at the time of the fall of the Republic

Society 2: The British Empire, in the decades before the American
Secession.

Society 3: The Caliphates, at the height of their expansion.

Society 4: Medival Japan, about 1200AD

Society 5: Vikings, about 900AD

Society 6: Pick it.  Describe the political, social, and
technological structure of your starting society, and outline
roughly how it got that way. It need not have a close
correspondence to anything in Earth history, though there\'s no
objections to such correspondence.

From a page listing Austin Powers quotes.

http://members.theglobe.com/suefalco/falco.html

I can\'t account for the accuracy but here it is:

Dr. Evil: My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner
from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My
mother was a fifteen-year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed
feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous
claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse
chestnuts of being lazy... the sort of general malaise that only the genius
possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical... summers in
Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we\'d make meat helmets. When I was
insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds... pretty
standard, really. At the age of twelve, I received my first scribe. At the
age of fourteen, a Zoastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my
testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it\'s
breathtaking, I suggest you try it.

A silicon lifeform? Is this really possible? I know we here 
about it all the time in Sci-Fi, but I thought silicon did 
not form complicated enough molecules to  make this plausible. 
IIRC, I heard it would be more likely to find carbon based 
life in an ammonia atmosphere or perhaps methane. Any thoughts 
fellow Travellers?"

	Because we have only carbon-based life-forms to go on,
	the likelyhood of silicon-based life is purely
	conjectural. Fortunately, this is Traveller. Sure, it\'s
	harder SF than most other games, but if you watch a few
	of the threads on sensors, missiles, pirates (throwing
	salt over shoulder), jump drives, and contra-grav, you 
	might get the impression that Traveller science can be
	a little soft around the edges (from time to time). It
	could be argued that the most realistic, hard SF, 
	uncompromising vision of the future will be nothing like 
	the universe that Traveller presents. Or not. The bottom
	line is: including silicon-based life forms does not
	contravene any obvious, basic laws, so if you want them,
	go for it!

Medical triage has been well addressed in several posts, but I would
like to give my Cr0.02 on legal issues in a crash situation.  I\'m
assuming that your passenger ship is a commercial vessel; accordingly,
there will be some risk of litigation (much less than in contemporary
times, if your Traveller universe is anything like mine), and a
certainty of administrative reviews by the Imperial authorities that
issue licenses to ship\'s officers, shipping companies, and starship
manufacturers.

The ship\'s officers (and, to some extent, the crew) should take some
actions to minimize liability (even in the crash is easily shown to be
someone else\'s fault (like a pirate)).  Specifically, they should
preserve evidence and minimize the harm that has already occurred.  (I
won\'t address what plaintiffs\' lawyers should do, as they are not on the
scene.)

Preserving evidence:

I take a few cues from airplane crashes.  The computer keeps a log file
of everything that happens of which it is aware -- sensor readings,
command inputs, communications, etc.  The officers should of course try
to recover a copy of this file and take it with them, as well as leaving
a file in a secure place at the crash site.  

Any other physical evidence should be at least documented --
photo/holographed, described in detail in writing -- or possibly taken
along.  Efforts should be made to preserve anything left in situ.  What
this physical evidence might be depends on what actually happened. 
Missile fragments, bomb debris, a piece of another vessel with which
your ship collided, are fairly obvious possibilities.  

The other major category of evidence is testimonial evidence.  Some
crash victims may die soon.  It probably makes sense to record their
stories -- both what they saw, and how much they suffered.  This will
help with assessment of damages later (and gives you some good
opportunities for role-playing).  The officers may want to lock up the
stories of other survivors as well.

Minimizing the harm:

The officers and crew should take -- and should be seen to be taking --
the best possible care of their passengers and fellow crewmembers,
cargo, and company property, in that order.  That\'s their duty as ship\'s
personnel in any situation, of course.  Triage is an important part of
their duty to minimize the harm, by saving the maximum number of
people.   

One comment on triage itself:

Another category of triage may be something like, "alien species that
you don\'t know how to diagnose and treat".  Any passenger line would
give its medics basic training in treating the races commonly
encountered as passengers, but there may be some exotic sophonts
aboard.  The time required to look up information would probably be
better spent treating others.  

I hope you find these ideas useful in your ship crash scenario.

My suggestion:

Consider the two ends of the spectrum for craft that fall into the 100  to
800  range,  "a monstrously mass-produced design" which is sturdy  and easy
to maintain and a design that is of a more limited production.  To use
modern example and perhaps stretch the point a bit there are a lot of DC-3s
still flying cargo but you don\'t see may Ford Trimotors still in regular
service.  Yes I know that there is a age difference between the two but a
couldn\'t think of another near contemporary to a DC-3.  In part it just may
be that there are enough surplus spares circulating from "junkers" to keep
the existing ships of the high production line flying far longer than anyone
would expect.

What you might also find with such vessels as they move down the "food
chain" over time is that they become relegated to marginal back water short
hauls between low tech worlds with occasional runs to a class B or A port
for servicing.  They could turn up as asteroid mining ships,  intersystem
ferries,  or what have you; bottom feeding in what ever marginal economic
niche is available.    I can see occasions where such vessels might have
stretched out their maintenance to long and became stuck in a low tech
system.  They might then be converted to intersystem use with their jump
drives taken out of service.   To use a modern example picture a late 1800\'s
shallow draught steamer converted to a river boat in the back waters of the
far east in the early to mid 1900\'s.

Picture this for a scenario the PCs are left "on the beach" in some low tech
pest hole. They meet the proverbial old rummy ship owner in a bar, "She a
grand old vessel laddies, just needs a little fixing up she does.   The
Sybil Gael, she\'s a grand old gal.  Did I tell you I started on one just
like her \'cept younger, back when I first go the star itch.  Aye, with a
little love and a bit o\' luck she\'ll make jump again I swear it.   Plenty of
spares to be had, I know where there\'s a junker or two out in the belt.
I\'ve  been taking part off them for years."  Then he passes out face down on
the table.

Arbitrage, as you explain so well in FT, would sort this out. Otherwise this is
the prime opportunity for Free Traders.  Chase the mask minima and catch the
Megacorps out on their standard pricing. This is one of those financial
perpetual motion machines you warn us about in FT :)

I think the important point is it is unstreamlined LASH - pushed to (beyond?)
its logical conclusion.  USL works out cheaper then SL even after paying the
higher fuel fees and extra lighterage/handling fees, etc., at the highport.

Again, USL is more economic than SL. So restrict away.

I have already posted a partial response to this. A direct transfer of through
cargo is possible during the "match target system velocity" window. The design
was deliberately simplified to get the point across. I had already considered a
multi hull design, and even had a genuine FT fuel lighter included in one
design.

If the FT LASH designs were intended to dump the inbound lighters and pick up
new outbound ones in-system, then that is close to my suggestion. Though I would
still replace them with USL lighters. The way I read FT is that the lash tender
is waiting around for the lighters to unload/load and return which unnecessarily
ties up that valuable J drive. 

Hmmm, that means that nearly all lighters found in a system are owned by the
shipping lines. No wonder free traders have to use SL designs, otherwise they
would be stitched up by the shipping lines on lighterage fees.

I don\'t think that\'s the case. The tech level is the level of technology locally available, wherever it came from. In WBH, it\'s the upper limit of technology generally available on the planet - WBH then goes on to break it down into particular technical areas - medical, transport. etc.

Caligula murdered Tiberius for the throne.  He additionally murdered (either
directly or via his orders) numerous Roman citizens (and a
few Senators, for good measure) who did not agree with his succession -- his
paranoia even extended to those who were merely
suspicious of Tiberius\' death.  This, IMHO, qualifies as "murder to take or

Well, there are companies _still_ making parts for the DC-3, possibly
even entire aircraft.

The DC-3 is also (IMNSHO) as near a \'perfect\' aircraft the world\'s yet
seen, evidenced by it\'s longevity and vast popularity.

To carry on this analogy, take the Beowulf...probably as close as you\'ll
get to the DC3 in the OTU. 

There are companies turning out _new_ Beowulfs, so parts are readily
available. Then the limit becomes the absolute lifetime of the
\'airframe\'. Since a starship is built to different standards than an
aircraft airframe (shaving weight is a far lower priority in starship
design) I suspect it\'s lifespan is far greater. 

If significant pieces of the frame can be rebuilt or replaced, then the
effective lifespan of a starship becomes as long as you can keep either
a paper trail or the little serial number plaque in the drive room
together.

"Ayup, this is a Beowulf Mark 1, serial number in the low hundreds."

"WOW! How do you keep it flying?"

"Oh, easy...the only _original_ part is this polished brass wingnut
here. We use it for a weight on the engineers worklamp pull chain."

Next question: what about psychological effects?

   The first response is unlikely to be very organized or
coherent.  Ship\'s authorities are out of the picture at first, I
haven\'t decided if that\'s permanent. 
   I assume that the impact leaves everyone at least momentarily
shocked and I\'m making it a decreasingly less difficult task of
Endurance+Intelligence to begin functioning rationally in the
first minutes after the crash. (In the meantime, there is lots of
screaming, moaning, and general aimless milling about.) Some
people with scrapes, cuts, and bruises, and even more serious
injuries will have their wits gathered before others who are
unhurt. Several of those with skills that would be useful in
handling this crisis are themselves among the injured. What
skills or experience would give a bonus here?
   I\'m also making it a test of leadership skill (including
default levels) to determine whether a given person acts with
initiative or waits to be told what to do. A lot of inexperienced
people will be trying to take charge of their immediate
situations but failing in leadership tasks under the heavy
demands of this crisis.  There are several corporate and military
types aboard who will probably be more effective once they get
going, but so far they aren\'t the first ones on the ball, and
there is no guarantee that they will be cooperating at first.
   Quite a few people have basic first-aid skill and there are a
couple with some degree of medical skill, but to direct an
organized triage effort, they will have to either apply
leadership skills themselves or get the cooperation of whoever
else is most effectively in charge.
   Survival skills (finding shelter, water, and food) will come
into play fairly quickly, but I\'m not that far along yet.
   What probable effects and responses am I overlooking?

  I don\'t see it. If the building was blown up before you jumped,
then can you can jump 2 parsecs away and see the plot hatched 6
years ago, but how are you going to have any influence on that
from 2 pc away?  When you return, you reverse the "time travel"
and come back to the planet still at least 2 weeks after you left and still
after the bomb went off.
   If it wasn\'t blown up before you jumped, you jump away and see
the plot hatched and then come back and foil it, you haven\'t changed
history either. A lucky LEO could beat you to it any time.

Travelling forward in time doesn\'t violate causality. Indeed, we do it
every day.  Examples I have heard of causality violations include using
tachyons to send information back in time and using a giant spinning
cylinder of neutronium to rotate an object\'s space axis into its time axis.
I think both of these ideas have since been debunked, and in any case have
nothing to do with Traveller tech.

One is that _several_ people will try to take charge and start giving
contradictory orders. What if they both make their leadership rolls? Who
gets obeyed?

You\'ll also have those who refuse to follow orders given.

You\'ll also have to have someone who needs to be slapped into
submission, it\'s in the Disater Movie rules. ;-)

Seriously, watch some cheezoid disaster flicks for hints on how to
handle this sort of thing, particularly for the NPC\'s you\'ll need to run
alongside your players. 

Another tack is to read some true-life accounts of disaster survival.

Sort of off-traveller, but on the subject:

A long, LONG time ago, I read a SF novel about a bunch of people on a
starship liner who were marooned on an inhospitable planet. The first
chapter described their first night, huddled together trying to keep
warm, with some predator coming at them through their perimeter fires
and killing a lot of people. The rest of the novel went through their
struggle to survive.

The planet had a long eccentricity to it\'s orbit such that it went
though periodic deep winters and very hot summers, on like 20 year
cycles.

The involuntary colonists (the novel tracked them through a number of
generations) eventually tamed/befriended the predators, which turned out
to be sentient, had these little telepathic chinchillas for
communications...and that\'s where my memory stops.

This was published, most likely, in the 60\'s, in paperback form at
least.

Any ideas who the author may have been, or the title, or _anything_,
anyone?

This was one of the first SF novels I ever read; I must have been 10 or
so, but I don\'t think it was a juvenile.

It\'s said that in a crisis situation, you react based on your training
- -- so it\'s good to have gotten some training.  

For that reason, I\'d expect military people currently in service to get
their act together pretty quickly, and I\'d expect members of the elite
forces to be the fastest of these.  The longer a veteran has been out of
the service, the slower he or she is likely to have gotten.  To some
extent, greater rank will tend to slow people down, too, as they will be
experiencing crises and crisis training less often than lower rankers.  

Civilian emergency services types -- like police, fire, EMT -- should
also get some kind of bonus for responding quickly in an emergency.

Age is a factor that cuts across all backgrounds.  I\'m going to
generalize broadly from my own very limited experience with difficult
situations.  People in their 30s, 40s, and even 50s tend keep their
heads pretty well, recover from surprise quickly, and deal with their
own personal injuries pragmatically and coolly.  People in their teens
and 20s sometimes twitch back and forth ineffectually (but very
vigorously), and people in their 60s and above are just plain slower
than the middle-aged.  Young children would probably have the least
effective response to the situation.  

Race/species is another concern.  Vilani live longer than Solomani, so
they have more years of responding effectively.  Vargr are physically
less fragile than humans, but I\'m not sure we can draw any conclusion
about mental fragility.  How do Aslan males and females respond to
crises?  What else do you have aboard?

Even in 2d it\'s easy to show it doesn\'t work. Picture a system with 2
"routes" going to stars more or less on opposite sides of the system\'s
primary. 

To be able to have both *never* masked, you need to place the port well
above or below the star. Alas, if it\'s a G type star (just an example)
this means that it\'ll have an orbital period of no more than a couple
of years. Which means that much of the time *it* is masked from one or
the other. 

Your port won\'t just sit there, dead in space. It\'s either in orbit
around something (just about has to be the star) or it\'s falling into
the star. 

Now I\'m sure someone will point out that I can make the plane of the
orbit perpendicular to the line between the two other systems. Fine.
Now stick in a *third* system at right angles to the line. We\'re back
in the same boat. *It* will be masked for part of an orbit.

And for that matter, it\'s *not* that hard to jump to a portion of the
destination system that *isn\'t* masked, and then just boost at however
many gees your ship can do in normal space.

Ouch! That\'s going to eat fuel like crazy. You\'ll have to redisn that
farport as a huge *ship*, with all the extra stuff that requires,
drives, lots more fuel, etc. 

Also, the masked area can "move" far faster than a ship if the geometry
is "right".

Check out Fred Pohl & Jack Williamson\'s "Star Child" trilogy" for an
interesting aproach to what a "continuous creation" type universe might
be like. "The Reefs of Space" is one of the titles and refers to the
*very* different "Oort cloud" that sysyems have in their universe.

I think it was Dr. Richardson who published an article in Analog *many*
years back pointing out an odd correllation between bacterial growths
on photo plates at the observatory (due to contamination of the water
supply) and certain period meteor showers. :-)

Not necessarily. In some ways, the cloud could be treated as an
ecosystem. It\'s definitely complex enough to have *internal*
competition between different processes for doinmg the same thing. 

This would be a *very* strange sort of "evolution", but I seem to
recall something similar being suggested as a possiblity for other
planets.

It\'s possible, but not easy. One of the requirements is that one set of
observers be moving at a fair percentage of c with respect to the
others. 

I keep screwing up in my attempts to create an example. Maybe someone
else can construct an example. If they do, it needs to go into an FAQ. 

But in essence, the simplest method is for you to jump from A to B. At
B, you radio some info to a ship that\'s moving at a high velocity
relative to you. They immediately jump to A, and radio to the station
you started from. If they have the right velocity in the right
direction, the message will reach A *before* you left. 

It\'s trying to calculate the required velocity and direction where I
get lost. 

I\'m pretty sure that one of the key factors is that the duration of the
jump *can\'t* be the same in both frames. So, for example, they\'d say
your jump only took 3 days, and you\'d say that *their* jump only took 3
days. 

If jump duration *is* "frame invariant", then that gives an absolute
reference frame and relativity is out the window anyway.

Sorry, but while I agree that FTL implies Time Travel, your example
*doesn\'t* demonstrate any such thing. 

It\'s no different than finding an old recording.

Triage consists of dividing the injured into three groups (hence the
"tri" in triage).

1. Those who will die even if given the best care you have. This also
   may include people who *could* be saved, but only at the cost of
   excessive use of scarce resources (blood, meds, doctor\'s time). In
   other words, the people that you *might* save, but only at the cost
   of condemning several others to death.

2. Those who can wait for treatment. Either minor injuries, or injuries
   that are not life threatening, nor likely to "go bad" quickly. Ie
   "stable". 

3. Those who need treatment *now* and can be saved (or at least
   stabilized) quickly.

Group 1 gets moved off to one side and made comfortable. Probably given
pain killer if it can be spared. Basicly, you try to let them die as
comfortably as practical.

Group 2 gets moved off to a different location and also made
comfortable.

Group 3 gets immediate treatment, with the most urgent cases getting
treated first. 

After group 3 has been treated, then you stop and re-evaluate. You may
be able to help some group 1 patients after all. If not, you get
started on the group 2 patients.

And you may wind up deciding that some of the group 2 patients aren\'t
going to get much treatment. Scrapes, bruises and strains/sprains are
going to get *really* minimal care. 

In your scenario, detail are going to be modified. If it\'s practical to
send a party for help and have everybody else stay with the ship, then
your first goal after triage is to get the folks with the required
wilderness skills in shape for the trip. Plus enough folks in condition
to take care of the folks who stay with the ship.

If staying with the ship isn\'t practical, things get a *lot* uglier.
First goal is to convert as many as possible of the injured to "walking
wounded" status. And to get as many of the rest as you can
"transportable". Anybody who can neither walk, nor be moved via the
available methods is going to have to be written off. In fact, if the
need to abandon the ship is known early enough, it may even be a
consdideration in triage. Someone who would be in group 3, but is going
to be non-transportable for weeks may get shifted to group 1, for
example.

The hydrogen will likely be liquid in the tanks. So as they rupture,
it\'ll cause a lot of freezing damage to anything that gets soaked
before the LH2 evaporates. 

*IF* there\'s a spark once the hydrogen *gas* has mixed sufficiently
with air, it\'ll burn. An explosion is *very* unlikely. And since
hydrogen is lighter than air it ought to rise and any flames will be
pretty local. 

Basicly, if you can walk away from the crash, it *ain\'t* gonna explode.

There may be a *fire* hazard. And some *small* chance of an explosion. 
Hydrogen is not explosive. It\'ll explode if mixed with air in
percentages ranging from 4% to 74%. But it\'s more likely that the
"edges" of the cloud would ignite and burn.

One thing to be aware of is that a hydrogen fire *won\'t* look like the
Hindenburg. The flames there were from things like the fabric covering
burning (BTW, it turns out that the fabric may have been what started
the fire. The way it was treated amounted to impregnating it with
thermite!) 

Hydrogen burns in air with a pale blue flame. In daylight it\'s hard to
see. So you could have a player stumble into flames he can barely see!

Silicones are more likely. Where many organic compounds have a
"backbone" of carbon molecules ( -C-C-C-) with various side chains,
silicones use a Si-O-Si-O-Si- backbone. It\'s the -Si-Si-Si- stuff
that\'s just not varied enough.

Silicones *tend* to be more stable than analogous carbon compounds. So
silicone based life, if it somehow arose would require higher temps,
and possibly a more reactive atmosphere.

One interesting take on this is in Hal Clement\'s "Iceworld". It has a
species that\'s based on silicon or silcone (not sure which). They
breath *sulfur*, gaseous sulfur. Obviously their preferred temp range
is rather higher than ours. As I recall, they had to use banks of
mirrors reflecting sunlight into a valley to make a base on *Mercury*
tolerable! 

The "Iceworld" in the title is Earth... :-)

> IIRC, I heard it would be more

> methane. Any thoughts fellow Travellers?

Well, it turns out that ammonia/methane type atmospheres aren\'t all
that likely. The UV from the star will break water vapor down into H2
(which escapes into space) and O2, which sticks around and reacts with
the methane and ammonia.

3 O2 + 2 CH4 -> 2 CO2 + 2 H2O
2 O2 + 2 NH4 -> N2 + 2 H2O

So you wind up with an atmsphere of N2 & CO2. That\'s how Venus, Earth,
and Mars all started out. 

The CO2 reacts with rocks, forming carbonates. That\'s how Earth and
Mars wound up with a mostly nitrogen atmosphere. Venus got into a
runaway greenhouse effect, and that baked the CO2 out of the rocks. It
also lost more water early on, which didn\'t help. 

Mars lost a lot of water (being small) and a lot of the remaining CO2
is tied up in the polar caps. Leaving a thin nitrogen atmosphere.

Titan has a Nitrogen atmosphere too, but it seems to have retained a
lot of hydrocarbons. Last I heard, the atmsophere was thought to be
nitrogen with a large dose of "photochemical smog". 

And while the gas giants have lots of ammonia and methane, those are
*trace* components of the mostly H2/He atmospheres.

Actually, this is the sort of situation where moving a *big* asteroid
might not be a bad idea. It\'s kind hard to damage a nickel-iron
asteroid a few km in diameter. :-)

BTW, a good spot for a far port might be at the leading or trailing
Trojan point of the mainworld. That puts it 60 degrees ahead or behind
the planet in the same orbit. Thus, unless the orbit is really
elliptical, they\'ll stay at a fixed distance. It\'s also a good spot for
a comm relay for reaching outposts elsewhere in the system. Either the
planet or the station will be in line of sight. The star won\'t block
*both* of them at the same time. 

I\'m not sure if 60 degrees is enough seperation to handle jump masking
at all times. But if it isn\'t, then 120 degrees *is*, so you\'d have a
station at *each* Trojan point and *one* of them is almost always
unmasked. 

They\'d also make nice Naval bases. You\'d have to take both of them or
else put up with continual raiding of your attempts to blockade the
mainworld.

In addition, free traders are likely to call on class C-E starports,
without any highport at all.  This is another business opportunity for
free traders, as conventional freightliners (i.e., non-LASH designs), if
optimized for dealing with highports, would be unable to service systems
lacking highports, even if lighters are available in-system (at least,
_I_ wouldn\'t want to try to transfer cargo to lighters in free-fall,
without benefit of a highport).

> Society 1: Rome, at the time of the fall of the Republic

As I recall, they were up to cast bronze, but not cast iron. And they
had a decent concrete, though better formulas exist. Best of all, they
were into *results* for engineering probvlems, they weren\'t terribly
interested in theory. 

So assuming this society is similar, introduce better mining and
refining techniques. Also introduce better metalworking. A copy of
Agricola\'s "De Re Metallica" will handle a *lot* of this. Including
diagrams of better water wheels and methods of using them to pump water
out of mines, crush ore, etc. This would give them pretty much all the
metals known up to the time of the American Revolution. And lots of
iron. 

Beyond that, you\'d want to teach them how to make coke, how to build a
"reverberatory furnace", and a few other minor things. Those would get
them up to the point of making some really *nice* steel, as well as
cast iron. 

Open hearth furnaces are easy. Blast furtnaces are harder, but not as
hard as you might think. 

Mass production using water powered tools could easily be applied to
things like gear for legions. And extended to many consumer goods. 

Steam power would be possible at this point. They\'d have the tooling
and materials to build a steam engine. Electricity could be introduced
for some things at this point. Say, the telegraph and telephone.
Electric motors can wait for quite some time. 

Oh yeah, introduce the horse collar, so their horses can haul decent
loads. 

Add in some practical chemistry, and you\'ve reached or exceeded the
level of Society 2.

> Society 2: The British Empire, in the decades before the American
> Secession.

Introduce the blast furnace, the steam engine, and electricity and
chemistry. That can boost them to early industrial (say WWI) level
quickly.

> Society 3: The Caliphates, at the height of their expansion.

Much like the Romans, except that *these* folks will be interested in
theory as well as practice. 

> Society 4: Medi=E6val Japan, about 1200AD

The big problem here will be figuring out how to get the tech advances
adopted *inside* the "craftsman" system. 

> Society 5: Vikings, about 900AD

The hardest part here will be getting enough people together to do
anything industrial. The population is too scattered. At a guess, the
first step has to be improving agriculture. Better crops, and the
moldboard plow. And. again, the horse collar. 

Once you\'ve got enough population freed up from farming/ranching *and*
a decent poipulation base, you start on the mining and metalworking
technology.

Take a fairly standard neolithic society. Add a couple of factors.

First, an interest in trying new things (not necessarily giving up old
ones, but a willingness to try out new things, just to see how they
stack up). So the folks who visit other groups will notice anything the
other group does differently, and try to bring it home. This may even
turn them into one of the trading cultures such as the "Beaker People"
in neolithic Europe. 

The second factor would be inventing a concept along the lines of the
scientific method. So they\'ll start keeping track of the different ways
of doing things, and trying to figure out why some work and the others
don\'t. 

These folks could wind up advancing *very* rapidly. Though I expect at
some point they\'d learn it was best to be careful about telling
everything they knew to other cultures. But then at that time they
could start recruiting folks who were too inquistive for their own
cultures. 

So, for example, if the objects found in an archeological dig really
*are* crude batteries, used to electroplate items for some sort of
scam, if these folks had been around, they\'d have eventually gotten
curious about things and maybe managed to lear what was going on. Thus
leading to a group messing with electricity in Assyrian times!

Obviously, a world with a group like this would advance *fast*. It\'d
also be an *extreme* edge of the bell curve.

An interesting "uplift" example to consider is Leo Frankowski\'s "Conrad
Stargard" series. It has a modern day engineer from Poland get dumped
into early medieval Poland (10 years before the Mongol invasion). 

He has all kinds of fun bringing up their technology so they\'ll be able
to stop the invasion.

Looking over the list of skills in T4:

1.  Jack-Of-All-Trades:  This was the first one to jump out and smack me
upside the head.  To quote from CT Book 1, "the individual is proven
capable of handling a wide variety of situations, and is resourceful in
finding solutions and remedies."

2.  Diplomacy:  From the T4 book:  "The skill of...keeping a cool head
in frustrating situations...."  This skill would help both in terms of
initial ability to regain one\'s head, and in getting potential leaders
to work together.

3.  Survival:  Those trained to survive unpleasant experiences are
likely to react well when actually plunged into an unpleasant
experience.

4.  Tactics:  Persons with high levels of Tactics have probably actually
seen action, and have had to deal with things going to Ft. Polk in a
handbasket during their career.

Go back and reread "LASH Operations", p. FT65 sidebar. The only time delay
for the freighter is that required to drive from the breakout point on one
leg to the jump point for the next. The lighters for the inbound and
outbound cargo are different, and already loaded and waiting. Freight rates
for LASH tenders include a 50% overage in lighters to make this possible.

Good question. However, in a "military" situation it\'s whoever manages

In something closer to real life, I\'m fairly sure that if he choses to
excercise it, a ship\'s captain can *shoot* you for refusing to
cooperate in an emergency,. And I\'m sure that military crews wouldn\'t
hesitate to use deadly force.

You might also want to look at increasing their socio-econo-political
sophistication, by introducing such concepts as the modern nation-state,
free market economics, and, regretfully, bureaucracy.  That way, once
they begin to build larger settlements (a.k.a. "cities"), they can
effectively govern and coordinate these settlements as part of a larger
state.  This coordination will improve their ability to use whatever
advances they obtain or develop.

One other knowledge area that would be unusually valuable to this
society is the ability to determine longitude (as well as other
navigational skills that may be lacking in the Viking culture circa AD
900).  While this requires fairly accurate chronometers (and thus would
have to wait until the metallurgy phase), the Vikings would be
culturally inclined to use this knowledge to spread their influence
abroad.  The resulting cross-fertilization of ideas, as the Vikings
contacted other cultures, would help boost their technological and
cultural development.

E.g., Alive, which details the harrowing Argentine soccer training

discussion).  My girlfriend is reading Into Thin Air, about the 1996
disaster on Mt. Everest, but that was a long descent into chaos, not a

Strengths :- government infrastructure and population base, advanced
skills in engineering and architecture.

Problems :- no societal interest in \'basic research\'. Philosophy
borrowed from the Greeks. Religious organisations minor appendages of
the State (lack of groups to form \'technician\' or \'scientist\' groups

Personally, I\'d seperate the two and perhaps come up with a little chart for
various effects. For example, a failure of an Endurance task might cause the
person to vomit, dry heave, react in shock to wounds they\'ve received, stuff
like that. A failure on the Intelligence task might lead to temporary
madness, catatonia, complete and utter panic... whatever.

The biggest advantage would likely go to people with experience in the
emergency medical profession. Generally, a high first aid rating is likely
to indicate prior experience in this area. Combat medics, emergency room
personnel, etc. would also fall into this category.

Next on the line would be people like fire fighters, police officers, and
members of civilian volunteer organizations.

Real experience in the military might give a distinct bonus, while "green"
military types might get less of a bonus.

Basically, anyone who has ever dealt with trauma situations is going to get
a bonus, whether it\'s simple lifeguard experience or 8 years as a combat
medic. Most of this is pretty obvious, but there *are* going to be more than
a few people whose experiences are not accurately reflected by their skill
sets.

Although I\'ll bet some people might say that age should be a factor, I\'m not
positive. My brother\'s life was saved by a quick-acting teenaged lifeguard.
I was mugged several times in my teens, and never lost it or acted
irrationally. Same thing for the few accidents I\'ve been involved in.

Makes sense. Perhaps a second test of intelligence to see if they can
actually retain some semblance of rational thought. Even if they\'re not able
to take control of the situation effectively, the appearance of some sort of
order can help to create the real thing.

>A lot of inexperienced

>demands of this crisis.

And alot of inexperienced people may be keeping calm and trying to figure
out ways that they can help. It doesn\'t take alot of experience to get a
group of people together to start putting out fires or pulling bits of
wreckage off of victims of the crash.

Two good films to watch to get a feel for normal people reacting in crisis
situations are the Poseidon Adventure and Night of the Living Dead (which is
closer in psychology to a disaster film than most disaster films). Both
versions of Night are fine, but if you\'re strapped for time go with the
original.

There\'s also no guarantee that they will be effective either.

If you\'ve got *alot* of people, then it\'s likely that initially there will
be many groups acting independently at first. Once the situation gets a
little more normalized, the different groups will likely begin to cooperate.
Basically, what I\'m trying to say is that the effort will start from the
ground up, not from the top down.

The military and corporate types that you\'re talking about might be real
jerks and they might try to impose "order" on the situation which might only
cause the situation to become more chaotic. On the other hand, there *are* a
class of people that just believe that *they* are the only ones who know
what they\'re doing and this can cause a good deal of friction between
different groups fulfilling the same roles.

Other than that, I don\'t think that you\'re missing too much. Nothing obvious
at least.

1. IIRC the standard advice about staying with the wreckage [see Shadow\'s
post
   on Triage] is to do so because it\'s easy to spot, _unless_ you are in a
   jungle, in which case the searchers won\'t see the wreckage anyway, so you
   should follow the nearest stream [which eventually turns into a river and
   should lead to civilisation]. Do those who have crashed _want_ to be
found
   by the searchers, or are the searchers bad guys?
2. A number of management training courses use something called "The Desert
   Survival Situation" to teach teamwork, if you can get hold of the papers
   for it it makes a nice scenario. ("OK, you\'ve escaped from the wreckage.
   There are six of you and you have a map, an auto pistol, a parachute,
   a bottle of 500 salt tablets...")
3. For another slant on this situation, check out the book or the movie of
   "Flight of the Phoenix" by Elleston Trevor. (Air crash victims build a
   smaller plane out of the wreckage and fly out of the desert.)

Actually, the Norse had a quite effective "government". The "Thing" or
"Allthing" was an early form of congress or parliment. Iceland is noted
for having one that dates back to 1000 AD. 

They were quite well able to govern large groups.

T5 is currently in development, it\'s an evolution of T4 from what I have
seen. The character generation, skills and task system are in beta testing,
i.e. if you email Marc Miller and ask him nicely he may send you the Word
files for them. No release date that I know of.

http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/andyslack/Blue/Security/security.ht

Assuming you want to stick with the Imperium background and
have a bunch of CT stuff already... in descending order of priority IMHO:
1. Start by downloading the latest free version of GURPS Lite from
   http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite
   At a push, you could go without the Basic Set for some time if you
   had this. The way it handles skills like Mechanic, Engineer etc. is
   also closer to CT/MT than full GURPS. It is certainly less scary for
   new players than 500+ pages of rulebooks.
2. GURPS Basic Set, Third Edition, Revised and GURPS Traveller.
   This gets you the rules, character generation, Traveller-specific
   equipment, starship building, background on the Imperium milieu.
3. GURPS Space is IMHO mostly useful for world-building, and therefore if
   you already have your subsectors mapped you could do without it.
4. GURPS Compendium I has the definitions of some advantages, skills etc
   in the GT character templates, but again if you\'re converting an
   existing campaign [or not using the template method for characters]
   you could do without it.
5. Ultra Tech and Ultra Tech 2 are collections of cool gadgetry, but 
   you\'ve got plenty of widgetry in GT and GURPS Space.
6. GURPS Vehicles is only of interest if you want to design your own
   vehicles and firearms. If you just want to do ships, that\'s in GT.

If you want to create your own background, you need GURPS Space more
than GT.

YMMV.

Hey!  I was just trying to make a ship roughly equivalent in size and
"firepower".  It took me five minutes and I had no ST material (aside from
the everpresent Web, and my memory) to draw on.  I had no intention of
reproducing the Enterprise exactly.  For one thing, I would have to come up
with Warp and Impulse engines.

There was a sequel, _Space Barbarian(s?)_, recounting the colonists - now

The first book was a good read, full of some good bits...like one of the

based on the argument that if the Low TL worlds can just buy the stuff from 
the high TL worlds there is no incentive to increase their own capability.

I still like the first way.  It can give more of a disconnected/frontier feel

	Even at its most extreme, I don\'t think a free trader is ever going to be able to under-
cut a liner because of standard prices and masking.  In general, liners can break-even on half 
the price a free trader can.  Furthermore, standardized pricing makes sense in the context of 
more long-term relationships between lines and customers.  There are all kinds of mechanisms for 
creating this, from "frequent flier" bonuses to special services.  Realistically, companies with 
regular shipping needs are likely to sign annual or longer contracts with a particular 
line.  These sorts of practices would mitigate the impact of temporary and infrequent 
undercutting by free traders even if it could be achieved.

	USL is definitely cheaper.  By volume, most cargo is likely hauled this way.

See, when the crash actually happens things should go very quickly.
You\'ll want to be able to tell the PCs what they see, without
extensive dice rolling.  After the initial impact of the scene, when
people start taking control and the PCs actions might matter, things
can slow down a little, but until then the scene should run quickly.

For the players\' sake, you may consider shading the rules on the
behalf of the PCs (but not telling them).  This is even easier to do
if you\'re pre-rolling some of the NPC results - just add a little time
before the NPCs are coherent. :>  It is really boring to sit around a
game with your character incoherent while the NPCs take care of
everything.

Another thing to consider is asking the players "So, do you have any
reason to think your PC would recover quickly?"  They may come up with
surprising, and reasonable, answers.  Unfortunately it doesn\'t go well
with keeping the scene going fast.  But it means the player who
_thinks_ his character should have a bonus reacting won\'t be annoyed
because you overlooked that reason on your predetermined list of
bonuses.

I\'m pretty sure that one of the key factors is that the duration of
the
jump *can\'t* be the same in both frames. So, for example, they\'d say
your jump only took 3 days, and you\'d say that *their* jump only took
3
days. 

If jump duration *is* "frame invariant", then that gives an absolute
reference frame and relativity is out the window anyway.

Leonard Erickson (aka Shadow)
>>>> (end quoted material)
My impression of what Marc has said on the subject of Jump is that time
in Jump space (whatever that is) suggests that Jump is indeed frame
invariant, or at least not very sensitive to relativity effects.
Discussing this with a co-worker suggests the following:  The
variability in the time that a Jump lasts, and the other side effects
sometimes encountered may be enough to account for relativity effects
once they are worked over by Jump Space.  This may suggest that if one
initiates a Jump at a relativistic speed, one could expect that the time
spent in Jump will be towards the lower end of the possible Jump
time-frames.  On the other hand, Marc has often indicated that Jump is
normally undertaken while the ship is at "rest" or at least at very low
speed (I have always assumed that this rest or low speed is relative to
the planetary body the ship is leaving).  One could easily assume that
there is a REASON for this practice, and that this might suggest
mis-Jumps may be more common if one enters Jump while travelling at
relativistic speeds.

Also see \'Invader\' & \'Inheritor\', same author, same characters.

This is what the book is really about, skip this paragraph to get to the 
on topic stuff...
Although this is really a great look into how an alien race differs
psychologically from ours (we think \'I am becoming friends with him.\', they
think, \'I am entering into his sphere of influence\' or something like that.
The word \'friend\' and the alien\'s corrolary are untranslatable - we don\'t
have the hardwiring (in our brains) to understand them, and they don\'t 
understand \'like\', \'love\', etc... We both understand logic.

The alien\'s have just developed the steam engine, but are essentially at the
time of the british empire, sailing ships, etc... The peace agreement between
the (stranded) humans and the aliens requires that they slowly integrate
technology. This is good for both parties, but I won\'t get further into it
because then I would be dropping spoilers... (all this stuff is explained
right in the beginning of the book).

If only I can remember the book about the intelligent Oort cloud now...

I think you\'ve characterized this fairly well.  Not only can Low TL worlds "just by the stuff" 
from their High TL neighbors, it is actually much _cheaper_ to do this than produce it 
themselves.  This is what puts Low TL worlds in such an economic development bind.

	This is almost the case.  Anyone on a trade route can either place an order or simply buy 
from a business that has already imported the good.  It\'s hard to imagine why this wouldn\'t be 
the case unless there\'s a chronic shortage of shipping capacity.  The biggest barrier is not 
difficulty, but poverty.  Take another look at the per-capita income of a Low TL world.  They 
simply don\'t have the money to import high-tech equipment, which means they\'ll have to mostly 
make do with locally made goods.
	Furthermore, there\'s no reason the imported tech has to be pervasive.  Think about Africa 
or Central Asia.  They have imported trucks, radios, TVs, and even some computers.  But there 
are still plenty of people living in the traditional fashion with very few modern trappings. Low 
TL worlds will likely be the same.

Almost forgot.  The lanes will be approx. 14 1.5m squares long, 1 square
wide.  This is lane and target only, and does not include the scoring
table, which should be built as a crewstation.

Biological computer prototype unveiled 

By BBC News Online Science Editor Dr David Whitehouse 

A large-scale prototype of a computer that could be
smaller than a living cell has been designed by an
Israeli scientist. 

Some scientists believe that, in the future, small
biological computers could roam our bodies monitoring
our health and correcting any problems they may find. 

The prototype has been developed by Professor Ehud
Shapiro of the Computer Science Department at the
Weizmann Institute of Science.....

Actually, you\'re quite correct.  It perhaps would have been a bit
more accurate to say that the _progression_ from TL to TL seems
to assume yadda yadda yadda.  But even if I\'m way off base on
that as well (I don\'t think so, though), the Uplift Question
still stands - without importing material or finished goods, only
knowledge, how do you go about doing a tech uplift as indicated?

At first, there will be just a fire.  But as the hydrogen burns
out of the tank and oxygen mixes in, you will eventually get
to an explosive combination.  Then the tank will go up.  I don\'t
think it will be humungous explosion thought.  Being a 100 yards
away and behind something should do it.  The time it takes will depend on
how big a breach there is in the tank.  A larger breach will let it reach
an explosive mixture sooner, but will let the energy disapate less
violently.

Waaay faster than the plasma gun or BFG-9000 in Doom.  Faster than a

It\'s gotta be waaay faster than the plasma gun in Doom, and faster still
than the BFG-9000.  Waaaay faster.  I guess that\'s not very helpful.  I
wonder what the real answer is (besides slower than a laser and faster

Looking at my various copies of Traveller stuff (pre-GURPS), 
- - Megatraveller specifically says that the TL is the tech level generally 
available (as do WBH and Grand Census).
- - Book 3 says it\'s the "general quality and capability of local industry" and 
indicates the type of goods "in general use".
So, pre-GURPS, it looks like imported technology is very much not pervasive. 
And that is the way most people I know have been playing the game.

There are several barriers besides poverty:
- - no repair infrastructure/skills/spare parts, except imported ones
- - up to TL4, poor distribution networks; up to TL7/8, global distribution is slower than interstellar distribution.
- - no enabling infrastructure (why buy a phone if there\'s no network, or a TV if there are no broadcasters, or no energy supply grid, or a car if there\'s no refined fuels)
- - poverty and low population concentrations -> no incentive to invest in supporting infrastructure (why build and supply a global chain of WalMarts to service a global population of say, 5000, or even 500,000).
- - unlike today\'s surface shipping, the cost of moving goods does not decline rapidly as volume increases: though there is some saving on hull construction, propellant costs are directly related to displacement. Therefore less of a significant advantage in shipping in bulk. 
- - slow communications increase risk of mass shipping, due to lack of foreknowledge of price fluctuations

All these factors taken into consideration:
- - on low TL worlds, imported technology concentrates at the starport(s) with very little or slow leakage to other centres
- - using the same assumptions as in Far Trader (and eg Merchant Prince), high TL=high value, so wealth concentrates round the starport also
- - mass shipping concentrates on low risk, low fluctuation items (typically food and raw materials - in general it will be pretty easy to determine the native ability to supply, the ability of competing/surrounding worlds to supply and demand will be fairly constant, so pricing is alot easier).
- - technology items are traded on a small scale at high margins within the starport(s)

PS: The copy of Book 3 I picked out was a second hand copy. The previous owner has written in, in pencil, some of the gaps in the tech level table. So TL0 flying is "jumping" and a TL0 computer is "fingers".

If modern passenger aircraft can be as used as a reference point some have
emergency O2 in tanks others have O2 generators.    Its my understanding
that O2 generators are presently predominant.   They generate O2 through
chemical action,  the only draw back is they get pretty hot in the process.

The point of far ports is to minimise m-drive size, and time spent in-system
(around 0.3 G and 8 hours). So if I have to do that I will fall back on drop
freighters.

GT, you don\'t need fuel for the m-drive...

I was assuming an appropriate eccentric orbit could be found to minimise the
amount you had to move (if at all). Nearest star at mask minimum, furthest at
mask maximum. Therefore minimising the size of the m-drive you would need -
occassional push at aphelion & perihelion.

Your later post on using trojan points looks much better though.

Great idea. It works well enough for a main world in the hab zone for any star
above size K0 (using First In figures). And for a small M or K star a far port
in an unmasked orbit isn\'t that far in any case.  The trojans of a world in the
hab zone of a large A0 star are quite some way however - worst case could be 10

I had read it and hadn\'t interpreted it like that on the first or second time of
reading. I see that you could read it like that, though there is an extra delay
for refueling in the text (this could probably be eliminated by docking with
fast oilers on the way to the exit j-point). The (illegal) LASH design in the
appendix could also be taken to be suggesting replacement lighters.  I guess it
needs to be made more explicit.

So the only real difference between what I was suggesting and the LASH operation
as described is that:
- - I choose a jump entry point that is the same as the jump exit point
- - The outbound freight, fuel & crew is waiting at the jump entry point and not
the port.
- - I don\'t have a refuelling delay.
- - I use a single USL lighter.

The first three are just a different choice of logistics - all pretty standard
stuff. 

The USL thing means I am always dependant on in-system SL lighters - the
economics seem to dictate this, though I am wavering. Note the LASH design has
to pay the starport fee and extra berthing for the streamlining overhead of
every lighter, whereas a singe USL lighter only pays it once and pays less.

BTW I am considering using a standard oiler as the fuel tanks of a jump section
*directly* - so no refuel delay, standard components and free fuel! (if you own
the lighter).

Hmmm .... actually I\'d argue that tech uplift is actually a question not of 
invention but of consciously putting in place infrastructure to make the 
introduction of the new technology useful. eg introduction of automobiles 
requires refined fuels, places to supply refined fuels close enough that a car 
can travel between them on a full tank, distribution of fuel to retail 
centers, spare parts networks, trained mechanics, tyre production and retail 
etc. Hence the cost. I think that Pocket Empires reflects this quite well by 
placing a cost on technical advancement. However:

- - if you look at the Uplift rules in Pocket Empires, locally bootstrapped 
uplift requires surplus resources, and if you then apply the rules to see what 
surplus resources are available, by and large they simply aren\'t around for 
poor worlds over short timescales.

- - uplift by outside intervention requires even more surplus resources, but 
because many of the high TL worlds are relatively low-pop, they probably don\'t 
have the resources either! The only worlds with capability are those with 
population codes of about 8 upwards AND TL 10 (Traveller TL) plus. And there 
are only one or two of these powerhouses per subsector. And they are busy 
building and supporting the Imperial navy.

- - everyone has an interest in the status quo (except maybe Dulinor), plus the 
Imperium enforces the status quo, so there is a general feeling of stagnation. 
Once Cleon hits town all the meddling in the affairs of your neighbours stops. 
Real world example: in Afghanistan at the time of the Russian invasion, many 
of the tribesmen were still carrying round rifles they captured from the 
British and/or the Russians in the 19th Century. As a result of the conflict, 
they acquired high end military technology from the West and Pakistan, etc. If 
there hadn\'t been a conflict, or nobody had been allowed to intervene, they\'d 
still have had to fight with 19th century rifles. Also try reading Keith 
Roberts\' Pavane, an alternate history where, due to the Spanish Armada winning 
and establishing a Catholic hegemony in Europe, technological change has 
slowed to a crawl (even if you don\'t agree with the argument, you should read 
this book, though).

But the high tech stuff will pop up in the *oddest* places. For
example, most third world countries either have or are installing quite
modern phone systems. Even if it\'s mostly at the "one phone for the
village" level. Cell relays or even satellite phones are a *hell* of a
lot cheaper than running wire through the back country. And they don\'t
require near as much maintenance.

Plus places like India and some places in Africa where they provide
villages with a satellite receiver and a TV so the villagers can learn
better farming techniques, birth control, and general health info.

So players can get "surprised" when the "primitive nomads" they left
behind after stealing the eye of the idol (or whatever) have radioed
the local police and there\'s a bunch of cops waiting for them at the
entrance to the starport. Don\'t forget that even if they are in an air
vehicle, the port authorities are not likely to be amused if they try
flying it over the barrier. After all, extrality *does* require that
you let the locals have a crack at folks trying to escape into the
port. :-)

My other favorite "high tech on low tech" dodge is the native guide who
amazes the players with how well he can predict the weather. Until they
find out he\'s got a pocket radio or vid unit that he\'s been catching
the satellite info on!

Both are quite reasonable investments for a person or group on such a
world. The nomads *will* want to contact the outside sometimes, say for
medical help, and it beats the hell out of sending a runner. 

I expect that even *with* the low incomes, most low tech worlds will
get a satellite weather monitoring network early on, and probably
something like the Iridium satellite phone system not much later. As
well as some satellite transmitters for radio/TV.

The cost of the *satellites* involved isn\'t all that high. *Especially*
when they don\'t have to be miniaturized to death and built to function
without maintenance. 

Anyplace that has a *real* port can easily place (or have placed)
satellites. And getting maintainence done is easy too. 

I expect that most of the satellite networks are placed by folks for
*free*, because they plan to make their profits selling the phones and
receivers. Even worlds with class E or X ports could have a satellite
network. The corporation that owned the satellites would just have
ships visit every so often (6 months? a year?) to check the satellites,
and see if the folks at the trading post needed more stock or parts for
repairing damaged ground units. 

Just about an large scale government is an *easy* sell for the phones
and the comm & weather satellites. The phones give them a way to keep
their military linked both to each other and to headquarters.

The weather satellites are obviously useful. What\'s it worth to *know*
that you\'ve got a thunderstorm coming during harvest? Or when the rain
will let up when you are getting ready to attack.

The comm sats let the government spread its version of events to
everyone at once. And a few special effects to enhance the image of the
King, Emperor, or Prophet won\'t hurt.

Oh yeah, GPS is easily included in the sort of satellites used for the
phone system. And having a "locator" in each phone isn\'t a bad idea.
*Especially* for military and civil government use. Surveying becomes a
lot simpler. Which will please the tax collectors.

"Lord Shukash? My instruments indicate that your boundary markers are
*here*." (points to map) "And according my calculations, that makes
your estates cover 20,000 ri. Yet the old tax records show them as only
10,000 ri? Ah, well, the old maps *were* in error at times. Just be
sure to remit taxes for the full *20* thousand ri of land next year."

(Obviously, it\'s been explained to the government that there are likely
so many errors that there\'s no point in assessing penalties for the
"missing" taxes. And that not giving them a full year to collect taxes
based on the *new* survey might cause some problems as well.)

What\'s it worth to a military commander to *know* where he is. And have
accurate maps (another profit center for anybody with an old Scout
ship, or any other ship with appropriate surveying equipment added).

Oh yeah, I\'m willing to bet that as long as the "phones" are government
owned, the location info is likely to be two way. That is, the phone
will show where the caller is. 

"General, why are you 30 miles *behind* the front?"

There\'s an old James White novel that has aliens using a habitable, but
uncolonized planet as a POW camp. They\'ve got satellites keeping an eye
on things, and they are programmed to fire on things such as large
concentrations of metal (to prevent the humans from trying to build
weapons). 

They basicly take prisoners that aren\'t too injured and land a small
ship and point a gun at the prisoners and tell them to march off the
ramp and onto the ground. They then pull in the ramp and take off.

The prisoners have managed to determine some things, like what the
"limits" on the satellites are. Picture people taking turns adding one
more bit of scrap metal to a pile to see when it gets zapped. Keep in
mind that the person who adds the last bit of metal is liable to get
caught in the "zap".

It\'d make an interesting scenario for an adventure. "All" you have to
do is figure out how to escape. :-)

Ah! but that\'s the whole point. *All* velocities are measured relative
to something else. And relativity says that *all* frames (ie objects
moving at different *constant* velocities relative to you) are equally
valid. 

So *all* jumps are at high fractions of C if your velocity reference is
a distant galaxy, or a close in object that\'s moving really fast. 

Thus that *can\'t* affect jump, because your velocity when entering jump
is a purely *arbitrary* figure. You get different answers depending on
what your reference frame is. 

So we are back to one of two possibilities. A jump *always*
takes a week (plus or minus the normal variation), regardless of what
your velocity is relative to whatever. Ie, a week "subjective" time.
This is reasonable, because other things like oscillations of atoms
also take the same time, regardless of frame.

Or it takes a week in the reference frame of the local stellar motion.
This one screws royally with relativity. It either requires defining a
special frame (ie a "frame" where the laws of physics are "right" as
opposed to all the others where they vary according to how fast you are
moving relative to the special frame) *or* it requires allowing
simultaneity at a distance. Another relativistic no-no. 


So the setup for a time paradox might be having A & B one parsec apart,
moving at "normal" velocity. You jump from A to B and arrive one week
later. Meanwhile, X is passing B at about 86% of c (tau of .5, gamma of
2). You radio him a message just as he passes by, and he jumps for A as
soon as he receives the message. 

In *his* frame, A&B are only half a parsec apart. It\'s still a Jump 1.
He gets there a week later *his* time. Which according to you is *3.5*
days later. BTW, he saw *your* jump as being over half a parsec and
only taking 3.5 days. 

The only point that both you and X agree upon is that when and where
the message passed between you. I\'m *not* going to try calculating when
he saw you leave A or When you saw him arrive there. But I\'m fairly
sure that if done properly, it\'ll wind up with him arriving before you
left. If not, play with the velocity. Sooner or later you\'ll hit the
right range.

I have about a hundred people and a range of occupations and

Already being considered. "Establishing leadership" of a given
person is at least a difficult leadership task if you aren\'t
already a recognized authority, and it gets harder if that person
has leadership ability himself.  If you haven\'t established
leadership, lotsa luck getting anyone to pay attention to your
wishes (orders, suggestions, whatever).  Keeping a leadership
role once you have it is probably an average task, but in an
uncertain and rapidly changing situation like this one, lots of
checks will be called for.  Loyalty or willingness to follow is a
matter of degree, and should be affected by the leader\'s overall
success at leadership tasks among other things.  Dominance games,
disobedience, competition, and politicking are all part of the
process. Deciding who is going to take charge of this group is
going to be somewhat Darwinian.

>Another tack is to read some true-life accounts of disaster

True-life disasters involving a hundred or so people in
reasonably hospitable but otherwise isolated wilderness areas
are a bit thin on the ground, unfortunately. There was an airline
crash in the Andes some 25-30 years ago that provides the closest
recent parallel I can think of, except I\'m putting the ship down
in more hospitable territory. The chances of there being a rescue
are not very good.

<snippage>

Thanks for the thought, but legal issues will not probably not be
a major concern.  After two major misjumps, the ship is no longer
even in the same sector it left from and is somewhere outside
Imperial space, probably on the trailing rim. Imperial
authorities will record the ship as missing and presumed lost. 
After the usual searches in the vicinity of its last known
destination turn up empty, it will declare the colonists legally
dead and add this to the "unsolved ship disappearances" file.
The measures you suggest will probably become objects of
contention between the "plan for rescue" versus "plan to stay
permanently" factions among the passengers.

  Could Robert clarify a couple of things? From the blunt trauma

injuries are in pain but can still function (average vs.
endurance to respond to other stimuli, harder with multiple
injuries or perhaps based on wound points);  those with "Minor" injuries

catastrophe check includes a check for consciousness; If a consciousness
check fails, treat as an injury to Intelligence (Subtract 2D-1 points: 0 is
full unconsciousness). Collisions and crashes often create multiple
injuries, so I\'m making the number of important injuries equal to the
number of characteristics affected.

The ship\'s bridge crew are the only ones that might have known
where within three dozen parsecs they are, and that\'s only if the
astrogator managed to get a proper fix after emerging from the
last misjump. No one aboard knows where or even if there are any
settlements on the planet. The ship\'s medical supplies will be
exhausted PDQ, because the casualty list will show that 80% of
the passengers and crew have at least superficial injuries. 
Unless a radiation, chemical, or fire hazard develops, the ship
will do for temporary shelter and answer a pressing immediate
survival problem.

Interstellar Ship Star Explorer


Explorer Experimental Scout Ship (Type SZ)
The first interstellar ship created on Eide, the 250 ton Star Explorer was
sent to the nearby system of Amho to gather information. The Explorer crew
complement consists of a Pilot, Navigator, Engineer, and Medic, with 2
Gunners, and Computer/Sensors Operator making the full crew complement. The
ship has two turrets with 2 Beam Lasers, and 1 Sandcaster each. There are 4
staterooms, fuel scoops, and a fuel purification plant. The ship can
actually be deployed as a 200 ton small attack vessel, but generally the 50
ton sensor module is added for heightened information appraisal. The sensor
module is the only reason for the state of the art computer system. Other
states have believed this ship to be essentially an espionage device, and
were quite surprised when it simply disappeared on 1043/162.

Be aware that there\'s an erratum affecting computation of the 100D radius
in First In.  The stellar-data tables say "radius" when they actually mean
"diameter," and as a result the 100D radius is actually half what the book
says it is.  So the masking for small stars is likely to be a bit more 
favorable
than you might think, if you\'re using the book as is.

I\'m working on gathering together all the places where this mistake crept
in, and will forward the result to the errata coordinator ASAP.

Cell phone companies not only put up cell towers for free (and offer free
phones), but they are willing to fight for the right to put up towers. 
I am not trying to get political, only to point out that current economic
practices show that this is true. Current laws (in NY at least) mandate
that areas w/o cell phone coverage get towers put up so you can dial 911
from anywhere. The cell phone companies are falling over each other to
find good sites in my area.

Actually, Icerigger deals with three people who wind up being marooned
on an ice-covered world on which live an intelligent, but low-tech,
species. (There are islands in the ocean of ice...) The book deals with
their attempts to first make friends with the natives, then soliciting
their aid in getting themselves back to "civilization" (an outpost that
the humans have on the other side of the planet). Not quite what we\'re
looking for...

(But it would make a suitable source for a Traveller scenario, providing
none of the players are familiar with the novel or its two sequels...)

  You\'d think so, in case of a leak? Plus, for a ship likely to see combat
you\'d want to remove the atmosphere to reduce secondary effects.

 While the artwork _might_ have appeared before, it was unattributed as it is 
in G:T. This is no known ship class. Based on the turret, this is either in 
the 100-400 ton range, or in the 1000-4000 ton range (with the turret 
becoming a bay weapon). Its lines suggest Vilani origins, though Aslan or 
Zhodani are also possibilities.

The Solomani Rim is different from the rest of the Imperium in that while
the maximum tech level is lower the average tech level is higher as is the
population of most worlds.  In MTU I play this as the result of an active
Aid program which reduces the resources available for research into new
technology by the Old Earth Union and the Solomani Confederation.  Both of
these goverments were much more intervention minded than the Imperium.

How about this. A starship emerges from jump having precalculated a vector
which means it would be coasting towards a world it does not intend to
visit. It drops its pod which would contain a small maneuver drive, some
fuel, and a pilot, robot, or computer (depending upon the union). The
starship then makes its next jump while the pod continues to the destination

Would something like this be viable?

IMHO, No. Advanced life support systems (TL10+, say)
 should have no need to replenish oxygen (tight
 recycling in space, draw in replacement gas from the
 atmosphere at an appropriate planetfall).

A significant LH2 leak may cause oxygen and nitrogen to
liquefy out of the air though, which will make the
subsequent fire all the more furious because of the 
higher oxygen content of the adjacent atmosphere.

I think this phenomenon was alluded to by another poster.

	All true, but you don\'t see nearly as much excitement to put up cell
towers all over sub-Saharan Africa or Central Asia.  Not enough people there
will be able to afford a cell phone to pay back the company\'s infrastructure 
investments. The fact that the company is willing to front the money is 
irrelevant. The availability of hi-tech imports doesn\'t change the fact that 
a low per-capita GDP means people have little money to spend on them.  
Communications may very well be where many societies choose to spend their 
limited resources, but those resources are limited, so we should be cautious 
about the enthusiasm of off-worlders to invest in them.

	Post-GURPS, imported technology is not pervasive either.  The goods 
both "generally available" and "in general use" will be of local 
manufacture. Imported goods will show up in critical uses such as: 
communications, medical, & military goods.

	Certainly food and raw materials are shipped in Traveller, and FT 
takes them into accout, but there\'s good reason to believe they don\'t 
account for the majority of cargo by *value*.  Simply put, shipping goods to 
another star system is relatively expensive so it makes sense to ship the 
most value-dense items first.  As for price fluctuations, commodity raw 
materials have much greater price swings than finished manufactured goods.  
Just follow the commodity price figures in the business section of your 
newspaper or on the web.

Thanks, Dom. It struck me the same way.

If there\'s no official stats on the ship, I think I\'ll

Damn now I have to start over.

Oh, and in a pinch the crew can run the "anti-hijack" software from the
bowling alley.  Wait, that means I have to add airtight bulkheads around
it.  Wouldn\'t want the crew to get gassed, burned, and frozen along with
others (the anti-hijack measures my players use tend to be a bit extreme).

I believe the artwork was originally in one of the MT books. I was
thinking about 400 dtons.

I thought perhaps to use it as a Darrian merchant designed for
them by an Imperial ship architect. The dorsal-mounted small craft
could be used as a gig. It\'s about the right size, I think.

So we are back to one of two possibilities. A jump *always*
takes a week (plus or minus the normal variation), regardless of what
your velocity is relative to whatever. Ie, a week "subjective" time.
This is reasonable, because other things like oscillations of atoms
also take the same time, regardless of frame.

Or it takes a week in the reference frame of the local stellar motion.
This one screws royally with relativity. It either requires defining a
special frame (ie a "frame" where the laws of physics are "right" as
opposed to all the others where they vary according to how fast you
are
moving relative to the special frame) *or* it requires allowing
simultaneity at a distance. Another relativistic no-no. 
<snip>

Leonard Erickson (aka Shadow)
>>>> (end quoted material)
The method I would choose to deal with Jump is the "special frame of
reference" method of FTL travel, as explained at:
http://www.physics.purdue.edu/~hinson/ftl/html/FTL_part4.html 
I think this works best with what I have read from Marc on the subject
of Jump.  Essentially, since Jump is the only method of mechanical FTL
travel available in the "standard" Traveller universe.  This does leave
psionic teleportation unfortunately.  So either teleportation and Jump
use different aspects of Jumpspace, and eventually people will figure
out how to do "instantaneous" Jumps, or teleportation is quite a
different phenomenon, and possibly subject to relativity/paradox
problems or to a different "special frame of reference."  I guess that
again my preferece would be for all psionics to be subject to a "special
frame of reference" but a different one from the Jumpspace SFOR.

Why not just limit psionic teleportation to lightspeed? IIRC, the ranges
involved are not significant enough to justify FTL travel.

You know, I tried making this using SSDS (because they have cooler sensor
rules)
and things are very different in that world... No lasers at TL9? Fusion
maneuver drives create power, so I don\'t need a power plant? I need a 15
crew members for this - 3 Eng-Drives, 4 Electronics, 2 Maneuvering,
4 Gunnery, and 2 Command?

Some questions are: 
It looks like I need 1 basic life support unit and 15 Crew G-Tanks.
I just wanted 2 Heavy Turrets with 2 missiles ea. Why do I need 4 Gunners?
I also would need at least one stateroom (for the captain), and 14 bunks. Is
this normal?

The ship needs to spend a week exploring the system - determine planets,
check again, maneuver towards promising places, do close surveys of promising
planets, and refuel at a local gas giant (of course, the Fusion drives use
Hydrogen, right?) jump out, and be recovered by the scientists who built the
thing (If this whole jump drive thing really works, and there are no bugs in
the navigation software -- volunteers anyone?)

So the question is: How much maneuver fuel would you think is necessary? 
Remember that we have never investigated another solar system before. I was
thinking 2 weeks of maneuver, and I end up with a minimum 400 ton hull. If I
make it 1 week of maneuver, I can get away with the 200 ton hull, only 15 
crew members, and cut a few other corners.

In other words, I think this is 1 week of constant 4G acceleration, more
than I would need (which is what I want). Is this correct?

This ship is based on the earlier (TL8) Explorer class ship, used to 
explore the outer solar system, hence the high G rating. Also there are
reasons to be paranoid on this first jump, and think defense might be
important.

I\'m going to make:

Common error...you need enough powerplant to run CG, LS and anything
you\'ll want to keep going during jump, or during planetary landings
(running a fusion drive is kinda nasty in an atmosphere, or in a jump
bubble).

Communications and medical are two examples where you can see TL differences 
in *general use* today. On medical technology, there is a significant 
difference in the availability of technology between the US and Europe, even 
before going on to the differences between the West and the rest. That comes 
down to the relative proportions of GDP spent on medical technologies, but 
translates to the model of some worlds just not having the money.

On communications, we are shipping clockwork radios for parts of Africa 
because they have no infrastructure which allows them mains supply and/or a 
dependable supply of batteries.

On military items:
- - using the Pocket Empires/Naval Squadrons model (which you guys may disavow, 
I dunno), most worlds don\'t have the resources to support a standing army
- - under the Pax Imperia, they can\'t run one anyway. If they did need a 
standing army, and given the way that Imperial period warfare seems to work, 
they\'d better build a local armaments infrastructure which can be sustained 
while the world is under blockade.
- - Imperial agencies & larger corporations will ship their own stuff rather 
than buy it locally
- - which leaves law enforcement, criminal use, private agencies and 
consumer/sports use. The last two are going to basically use something within 
their budget (a relatively small tech level leap if at all). Criminals are 
going to go for the best advantage they can (which is probably determined by 
the tech level of surrounding worlds, as well as the extent to which the local 
economy makes such investment worth their while), and law enforcement will try 
and match that. So in these cases you probably see somewhat higher tech.

Hmmm ... actually its a question of potential market (pop * income) versus 
cost of sale. I guess if under FT income is actually an expression of monetary 
income, TL (which would include infrastructure) and population density then 
this is true, but it\'s stretching most people\'s understanding of the word 
poverty.

I just checked the Guardian for the interstellar traded commodities page but they don\'t seem to print it on a Wednesday :-)

Commodity raw material price fluctuations on 20th century earth are a reflection of the market conditions and infrastructure that support them. The assumptions in the Imperium are drastically different:

- - 7 day communication and shipping time (communication time = shipping time)
- - many markets (ie systems) cannot support themselves in essentials. especially food. In which case there are going to be market conditions (either by price or subsidy) which ensure that these goods are shipped first (since if such conditions did not prevail the systems in question would die, pace Hard Times). Because demand is relatively fixed and local production are fixed, the variables are the price where I buy the products I\'m going to sell (which is subject to similar variations to those we experience today) and the number of other people importing commodities to the target market. This is a very different position to the one we experience today.
- - the really big economies generate so much demand, and interstellar shipping is so relatively expensive, that large scale export becomes uneconomic. Most of production by the large industrial economies is probably for the domestic market.

What I\'m stumbling towards is that the weakness and size of the smaller markets, and of local infrastructure, militates against large scale freight. On the other hand, there must be an economic system which allows for low value essential goods (essential being food, some medicine and life support) to be transferred on a large scale in order to support these worlds. 

Maybe it is like transatlantic airline economics where the plane is actually put into the air by the club and first class tickets and the coach class is just a way of recovering costs for the rest of the plane. Maybe large scale freight necessarily includes a large quantity of low-value essentials and a small quantity of high-value consumer/luxury items, which act as the main profit centre.

Alternatively, large scale freight brings essentials (food, life support) to the smaller markets and returns with raw materials bound eventually for the larger economies (which are so large that they rapidly deplete local supplies - problem though is it would be cheaper to mine insystem than trade across systems), and is maybe subsidised in some way. Non-mass demand items (everything else) is carried by small traders.

Alternative three - large scale freight is subsidised in some way, other items are carried by small traders.

Or some combination of the above. Ideas?

You know I have looked at that table about 50 times and had always read it as
diameter - I knew it was diameter from the G0/G5 numbers as I have done sums on
SOL before (i.e. G2 Sol D is just under .01 AU).

I had only today realised it actually said radius and was about to post for
clarification to the list.

BTW, I have randomly generated about 50 systems using First In, and it took me
46 attempts to get one Earthlike planet. Got a few rockballs, a few asteroid
belts, and a hostile world in the hab zone, but it is very difficult to get an
"earth-like" world.  It is very hard indeed to get one with an earth-like
temperature range.

(Aside: I have yet to get past step 17 of the process...)

I have some questions on the First In planet generation mechanics:

Is it really possible for a multiple star system containing a white dwarf to 
have habitable planets? Wouldn\'t the death of the star that led to the white
dwarf have sterilised any planets, and blown away their atmospheres? Wouldn\'t 
the dying star have lost mass and therefore the orbits would have changed, or
at least the forbidden orbits zone should be much larger (based on pre-white 
dwarf star type which must be bigger than the current primary)?

Since changing the way I generate systems, I am now getting "earth-like" planets
that are quite a bit warmer or cooler than earth.  Is there a good source of
terra-forming information - scientific or SF - that I can use to add colour to
change the temp of these worlds? Stuff the would be visible from space would be
nice e.g. orbiting mirrors to warm cities, generated cloud cover to change
albedo, regular crash landing of comets, as well as the bio-options).

When is the program available ? :)

I wasn\'t envisaging anything so extreme.  If you take a can of
liquid hydrogen and light the hydrogen streaming out, it will be
content to burn "sort of" like a blow torch with the hydrogen
expansion preventing the oxygen from entering.  This will continue
as long as the liquid hydrogen exist in the tank.  (I\'m no expert
on BLVE, but I would guess to get that you would have crack the
tank completely open and spill the liquid out, mixing it freely
with the air).  Once the liquid has boiled off, the burned hyrogen
will start being replaced by air.  At some point you are going to
have a can with hydrogen and air in an explosive mixture.  This is
decently, but no exceptionally, explosive.

Yes, if you do everything at random it can be rather hard to get Earthlike
planets.  Just for starters, it\'s hard to get an Earthlike planet around any
star dimmer than about a K5 -- the best candidates near red-dwarf stars
tend to be too small and tide-locked to boot.  And there are so *many*
red dwarf stars. . .

There\'s a pretty good chance of getting at least one planet in the life
zone, but then it has to be big enough to hold a substantial atmosphere.
And then it has to be old enough for complex life forms to evolve.  The
odds do go down fast.  I suspect your record shows some bad luck,
but certainly you\'re not going to get a garden planet every time.

Whether it\'s clear in the text or not, I expect that folks who like the
feel of Classic Traveller (lots of garden planets, even around red-
dwarf stars) will want to proceed by fudging some of the die-rolls
and using some of the "Traveller Note" sections.  The rules as written
are realistic, but I won\'t come and harass anyone who seasons them
to taste :-).

Just having a white dwarf star in the system doesn\'t mean that all the
planets are going to be uninhabitable.  Remember that the formation of
a white-dwarf star isn\'t all that violent an event -- the star experiences
some mass loss, but no explosion of supernova magnitude.  It\'s more
like a very intense solar wind.  If the red giant star is far enough away,
a planet would probably experience nothing worse than some climatic
effects, maybe some intense ionization of the upper atmosphere.  All
of that would tend to stabilize once the companion star had settled
down.

The arrangement of forbidden zones in the book is a deliberate
simplification -- they\'re always from one-third the minimum distance
between the two stars to three times the maximum distance.  When
the two stars are of very different size this isn\'t completely accurate,
but the actual computation is fairly complex and I didn\'t want to inflict
it on people.  The difference in mass between the "living" star and
its white-dwarf remnant isn\'t really enough to make a significant
difference.

There\'s a lot of "slop" in the random generation of albedo, since there are
an awful lot of factors that can affect it.  Take the procedure given as
an indication of what values are most likely, but feel free to set them to
a value that gives you the result you want, and come up with a handwave
to explain it if it\'s far from the mean.  That\'s not a bad approach to take
to any part of the book, actually.

>  When is the program available ? :)

Beats me.  I could do it myself (I\'m a fair hand with C or C++) but I just
don\'t have the time.  Of course, someone came up with a first draft
software package *during the playtest* (!) so I imagine it won\'t be too
long before some enterprising soul puts it together.

Yes, if you do everything at random it can be rather hard to get Earthlike
planets.  Just for starters, it\'s hard to get an Earthlike planet around any
star dimmer than about a K5 -- the best candidates near red-dwarf stars
tend to be too small and tide-locked to boot.  And there are so *many*
red dwarf stars. . .

There\'s a pretty good chance of getting at least one planet in the life
zone, but then it has to be big enough to hold a substantial atmosphere.
And then it has to be old enough for complex life forms to evolve.  The
odds do go down fast.  I suspect your record shows some bad luck,
but certainly you\'re not going to get a garden planet every time.

Whether it\'s clear in the text or not, I expect that folks who like the
feel of Classic Traveller (lots of garden planets, even around red-
dwarf stars) will want to proceed by fudging some of the die-rolls
and using some of the "Traveller Note" sections.  The rules as written
are realistic, but I won\'t come and harass anyone who seasons them
to taste :-).

Just having a white dwarf star in the system doesn\'t mean that all the
planets are going to be uninhabitable.  Remember that the formation of
a white-dwarf star isn\'t all that violent an event -- the star experiences
some mass loss, but no explosion of supernova magnitude.  It\'s more
like a very intense solar wind.  If the red giant star is far enough away,
a planet would probably experience nothing worse than some climatic
effects, maybe some intense ionization of the upper atmosphere.  All
of that would tend to stabilize once the companion star had settled
down.

The arrangement of forbidden zones in the book is a deliberate
simplification -- they\'re always from one-third the minimum distance
between the two stars to three times the maximum distance.  When
the two stars are of very different size this isn\'t completely accurate,
but the actual computation is fairly complex and I didn\'t want to inflict
it on people.  The difference in mass between the "living" star and
its white-dwarf remnant isn\'t really enough to make a significant
difference.

There\'s a lot of "slop" in the random generation of albedo, since there are
an awful lot of factors that can affect it.  Take the procedure given as
an indication of what values are most likely, but feel free to set them to
a value that gives you the result you want, and come up with a handwave
to explain it if it\'s far from the mean.  That\'s not a bad approach to take
to any part of the book, actually.

>  When is the program available ? :)

Beats me.  I could do it myself (I\'m a fair hand with C or C++) but I just
don\'t have the time.  Of course, someone came up with a first draft
software package *during the playtest* (!) so I imagine it won\'t be too
long before some enterprising soul puts it together.

Why not both?  There are enough Broadswords around, built in enough
different shipyards that there could easily be variant designs with doors
in either place.  Pick whichever you prefer.

Book 6: Scouts was like that too.  I ended up setting the temperature and
calculating backwards to the albedo, and sometimes just changing the star
type when I couldn\'t get things working out.

Looks like Grandfather was busy, nudging all those worlds into just the
right place... :-)

The vicarage worldbuilding site has the best collection of links I\'ve seen.
Nasa has some stuff (but finding it on their site will be...fun).  IIRC
Gillett\'s worldbuilding book (referenced in GT:FI) also has a chapter on
terraforming.

My 3d models (the minis from Rafm) have doors on the outside. So if you\'re
taking a vote...

I\'d got with the Keith drawings over Jaquays any day, but that\'s a personal
preference.

I expect these to be effective because of their social status and
leadership skill, which in my interpretation is the ability to
lead people effectively. A lot of military and corporate types have the
high rank because of their ability to push paper and only think that makes
them leaders: I think I have a couple of those aboard. There is a noble,

Since ship\'s authority is absent, bottom-up is what I\'m figuring.
Who comes to the fore and whether they cooperate or compete will
be the question.

Which is partly why I stipulated that there is *no* response at
the stage I am working on. It appears that intraship
communication is gone, so no one knows what the crew is doing.
Given the injury rates among the passengers, It\'s very unlikely the crew is
intact anyway.

At the stage I\'m working on, panic is the bigger problem. 
Is high intelligence an advantage to avoiding panic? It\'s easier

My take would be:  Depends on which shipyard built the Broadsword in
question, for whom, and when.  After all, specific customers may demand
specific features, license-built models may have minor differences, and
certain features may be modified over time.

Historical example:  The Grumman F4F Wildcat, a World War II US naval
fighter, displayed all of these traits.  The first version to see
widespread service was the F4F-3.  The French Navy ordered a version
with a different engine (this order was taken over by the British upon
France\'s surrender).  The next major variant was the F4F-4, with folding
wings.  Eastern Aircraft (born of General Motors) built two versions for
use on escort carriers:  The FM-1, which was essentially a copy of the
F4F-4; and the FM-2.  The FM-2 differed in several ways from the
Grumman-produced birds (most obvious was a different vertical
stabilizer).

Bottom line:  Go with whichever one you prefer.

From my navy training (i.e. I saw a file on BLVE in 96 at the fire school),
the safe zone is around 400 to 500 yards. The blast time may
increase/decrease  depending on how full the tanks are to start with (i.e. a
half full O2 tank will take longer to blow than a full tank) The blast is
very impressive. Things to think about, pressure wave (camera-man throw to
ground at about 600 yards, and fireman on exstended ladder trunk about 80
feet up and 150 yard from fire was never found)

 This one\'s easy: either or both, depending on shipyard and purchaser. I see 
it as one of those options the purchaser makes a decision on at the outset.

Don\'t overdo the panic thing - I think Hollywood likes it because it gives
action and noise.

IIRC there was a study into the Bradford City fire distaster in the UK.
(A wooden football stadium caught fire during a match.)

The result was that rather than the panic that all the press "observed"
during the event and reported the next day, there was instead, if anything,
too much calm and lack of urgency from the people not immediately threatened
by the fire.

Also a tendancy for people to expect that someone would take charge and
organise things properly.

This can be made worse by people who could organise others instead doing
stuff,
leaving lots of available help standing around and doing nothing.

It could be argued that increased civilisation makes things worse:
whilst the disaster professionals are better trained and better equipped,
the rest of the population expects the professionals to be there to solve
these problems.

But how is the oxygen going to get *in*? The *liquid* hydrogen is
boiling off and is going to be pushing everything else *out*. Once the
last of the hydrogen has boiled to gas, then as it goes out the top,
air can get in the bottom.

The trick with satellite phones is that you have to put in the whole
satellite network *anyway* for the system to be useful anyway. And
given the cheapness of access to orbit in Traveller, the whole
constellation of satellites ought to be under a million. 

And assuming that these things are relatively standard, off-world
visitors can use *their* phones too. They\'d just make a deposit (or
give a credit card number) to the outfit running the system. 

As for commsats and weather sats, those *are* what a lot of poor
countries here on earth have found to be *good* investments. And heck,
even with the lack of "local" stations, radios sell well throughout the
third world. Even if they do cost a month\'s wages or more.

And that sort of market leads to interesting products. For instance,
South Africa is now exporting a radio that I assume was originally
developed for sale in Africa. It\'s a medium sized, sturdy radio. With a
*crank*. You crank it for a minute or two, and it\'s good for 30 minutes
of listening. They also sell solar powered units. 

The advantages in back country Africa are obvious. But word got around
and folks in the US are buying them too. Not just "survivalists" but
folks who are tired of the batteries going dead in the middle of the
game while they are boating or fishing or whatever. 

So it\'s even possible that products developed for the "frontier" may
work their way *back* to "civilized" markets as "niche" products.

Check the ads in the magazines. Those radios are being *built* in the
industrialized parts of Africa, and while they were developed for the
"back country" they are actually being shipped *to* the US, for campers
and emergency use. Which actually has the effect of lowering the price
by upping the volume. Which means they are now *more* affordable for
the "natives".

That\'s ok. In the real world you won\'t *get* habitable worlds around A0

The good news is that there\'s a definitive work on terraforming. The
bad news is that it costs $70. I bought it anyway. But at more than 500
pages, I\'m not exactly going to be summarizing it. You might be abale
to find it at a library.

The table assumes that the mainworld is in the habitable zone of the
primary. For small, cool stars, that zone lies within the 100D limit. The
zone moves outward with increasing size and temperature faster than the
100D limit expands. The cross-over point is right around spectral class G0.
For large, hot stars, the habitable zone is well outside the 100D limit.

Yep.  But the imported goods you _do_ see are often in these sectors.  Remember, I\'m the one 
arguing that just because it\'s *possible* to simply order hi-tech goods out of a catalogue, that 
doesn\'t mean low-tech worlds are covered with hi-tech imports.

	I don\'t think the above is canonical.  My understanding is that worlds are definitely 
allowed to have their own planetary army and navy.  Whether they do or not again probably 
depends on their wealth.

	I was trying to keep this simple.  If you are looking for the most accurate measurement, 
it is WTN.  This takes into account GWP, GWP/capita, and TL.  
	As for my earlier point, the reason there are no repair centers, supporting 
infrastructure, etc.,is that there is not a large enough market to support them.  If the people 
on the planet became wealthier they would have more money to spend on such things and businesses 
would emerge to supply the increased demand.  This is why I said income is the most important 
thing.  "Poverty" was perhaps a loaded term, but I does mean relative deprivation and I didn\'t 
know you\'d want to get into it at this level of detail.

>Commodity raw material price fluctuations on 20th century earth are a reflection of the market 
conditions and infrastructure that support them. The assumptions in the Imperium are drastically 
different:

	First, what\'s important is not volatility compared to 20thCen Terra, but volatility 
relative to other goods in the 3I.  Second, I don\'t see how any of the differences you state 
below are going to greatly change the volatility of commodities.  Third, commodities are 
volatile precisely because they are often necessary raw materials (like food) for which demand 
does not change much with a change in price.  This is called inelastic demand.  Furthermore, 
supply is often quite inelastic as well (eg. the farmer who planted the crop a year ago is going 
to harvest it almost regardless of the price).  When you combine these two factors, a sudden 
change in demand (supply) will greatly change the price because suppliers (demanders) cannot 
easily change their production (consumption) to match changed conditions.

>- 7 day communication and shipping time (communication time = shipping time)

local production are fixed, the variables are the price where I buy the products I\'m going to 
sell (which is subject to similar variations to those we experien

very different position to the one we experience today.

	There are plenty of countries that are totally dependent on commodity imports, be they 
food or oil.  The fact that the populations of some Traveller planets would die without food 
imports only makes them more demand inelastic and hence more price volatile.
	The fact that _demand_ is stable does not at all mean that _prices_ are stable.

>- the really big economies generate so much demand, and interstellar shipping is so relatively 
expensive, that large scale export becomes uneconomic. Most of production by the large 
industrial economies is probably for the domestic market.

	Most production by the large industrial economies _is_ for the domestic market, but this 
has nothing to do with whether large scale exports are uneconomic.  BTW, you really need to be 
more clear what you mean by "large scale."  Large scale compared to Glisten\'s economy?  Or large 
scale compared to Asteltine\'s economy?  Glisten\'s total trade is only about 1% of its GWP, but 
total trade is 84% of Asteltine\'s GWP.  

>What I\'m stumbling towards is that the weakness and size of the smaller markets, and of local

economic system which allows for low value essential goods (essential

support these worlds. 

	You\'re arguing both sides of it now.  You\'re saying on the one hand large scale freight 
doesn\'t happen because the economies of outlying worlds are too small, but on the other hand 
large scale freight must happen because we know some worlds depend on it.  
	I think the answer comes in the definition of "large scale."  From the POV of Glisten, 
there is no large scale freight because the outlying worlds economies are too small to demand a 
significant fraction of Glisten\'s economic output.  From the POV of the outlying worlds, large 
scale trade does happen because big worlds like Glisten produce many things they can\'t live 
without and imports from those worlds are large relative to their local economies.

Well the inventor/manufacturer of these radios has a simple
mission...get as many of these into the hands of the world\'s poor as
possible, which is why they sell for $75 here in the states. His idea is
everyone who buys one here, is essentially buying two or three more for
Africa, by subsidizing the cost.

Also, he\'s starting to make them with 12v output jacks, too, so that
your crank flashlight or radio can also be used to power your laptop, CD
player or other gadget (like charging your run-down satellite phone so
you could call for help from the middle of the Kalihari ;-)

They are very cool devices.

Personally I think this is great. I never like the plethora of habitable planets
in the OTU, I think that Earth-type worlds should be extremely rare, with
technology being the primary way to overcome hostile environments. The use of
orbital colonies in the "green zone", biodomes on moderately hostile worlds, or
habitation by biologically adapted natives/colonists. Also, "adapted" could
include genegineered colonists or colonists of an alien race that had evolved on a
simular world.

I thought albedo was determined by atmospheric density and make-up. Can you really
tweak it at will without explaining it away as a technological modification? That
would add a little more "flavor" to star systems, IMHO.

Again, is this really undesirable?  Consider Hoth, not truly an ice-ball as it has
breathable atmosphere and an indiginous ecosystem. Unless Wampas are imported. And
for the other end of the scale, Tattooine.

There are two canonical forms of teleportation:  via psionics and via
Ancient technology.  Psionic teleportation is very limited in range, so
relativity issues don\'t tend to arise in practice (but theory should
still be addressed).  HIWG did a paper on physics explanations of
psionic phenonema, including teleportation, but I can\'t find my copy and
don\'t remember what it said.  

Ancient technology is described in Secret of the Ancients.  The Ancient
teleporter consists of two big ring-shaped devices.  Each ring opens
into and exits from the same very small pocket universe.  The rings
could of course be anywhere in our universe -- one here, the other one
in the next room or on the other side of the galaxy.  Because the pocket
universe is only one meter long, the traveller requires a fraction of a
second to go from one place to the other.  

The phenomenon of jump seems to be somewhat similar to Ancient
teleportation, but there are of course major differences.  

I leave the physics analysis to the scientists on the list.

You know, people in need might call out, "is there a doctor in the
house?", but no one ever asks, "is there a lawyer in the house?" and not
without good reason -- for all of us lawyers, being a risk-averse and
protection-oriented lot (how many lawyers like playing bodyguards and
security officers in Traveller? show of hands), will surely just not
hear the request and put our heads back down to whatever we were doing
- -- and the feeling of risk and unprotectedness of course arises in part
out of concern over committing malpractice in giving advice without
taking adequate time to gather in and reflect on all the relevant facts
and laws, for ours is not a profession that deals with emergencies in
the time frames faced by medical professionals, but that feeling is also
based on the possibility that the asker is really Jack Cade or Dick the
Butcher, instituting one of the planks of their revolutionary platform,
expressed in Henry VI, part 2 (but I don\'t have the act:scene citation,
sorry) as Jack sets forth his vision of utopian England with himself
("worshipped," if you please) as king, and Dick adds, "First thing we
do, let\'s kill all the lawyers!"

Ob Traveller:  Anyway, I don\'t know much about intellectual property
law, so I tend to stay out of these discussions on the TML, but I do
like to see the Bard quoted correctly.

3 is supported by canon.

However, option 4: any market too small for general trade, but with
specific needs for goods like food or breathables, will be supported by
some high value local commodity (including tourism). Nothing like someone
going to an acidbathed rock like wypoc to go hunting dragons. (When I first
generated encounter tables for wypoc, I got max rolls for a flying
predator....) Hunting dragons in an insidious atmosphere, using big guns...
big money. Trips start at about MCr1, departing from regina. Combat armor
included. Must be paid in reginan or imperial Credits. (Actual costs of the
trip 2j2 round trip, 1 suit combat armor, KCr100, KCr20 in expendable
weapons, food and life support charges. Most of which can be bough with
local TL 10 Credits....) so  a hefty levy on cash import can fund a quite
powerful economy.

Scary.

Time to put a Disclaimer in all my future posts related to legal issues. ;-)

I might change my sig file to
"Bloo, Esquire"

Except that I hate the "esquire" title because its absolutely meaningless
in the U.S., and most lawyers I know think its special and you\'re
only entitled to use it after you become a lawyer, when in fact,
anyone can claim that title, or any other.  I can claim the title
Lord, Duke, Count, whatever.

Does "Esquire" still carry some weight in the UK, Canada, Austrailia,
New Zealand?  If so, what do you call a lawyer who has been knighted?
"Sir Something, Esquire"? I hope the Esquire is dropped.

Would there be a title, or title suffix, for members of the Imperial Bar?
What would the Vilani equivalent be?

Bloo.

this site is great.  It sends a secure email message to your gamemaster

I would say that intelligence is only a minor factor. I think the more 
important ones would be personality and experience. Also remember that a 
percentage of the population is very resistant to panic while others panic 
very easily. This is independent of profession but of course not many in the 
last category are going to become successful emergency or military 
personnel.

Panic is not as common as in the movies but if it occurs it can be _very 
deadly if people are crushed or make stupid decisions (40 people were killed 
and many more were injured in Prague (?) when 10000 rushed for shelter in a 
subway station to avoid heavy rains).

The hab zone of stars below size K0 are *always* inside the 100D limit of the
star. The hab zones of more massive stars get progressively further away, in
star diameters. The hab zone of a massive A0 star is about 250 to 350 Star
Diameters out.  So the probability of masking decreases with increasing star
size. However the worst case masking for a small star isn\'t that big. The worst
case masking for a big star is huge. Hence the recent thread on far-ports.

Go on, put far-ports in the leading and trailing trojan points of all your main
worlds, you know it makes sense :-)

Notes from First In:
1) It is not scientifically likely that stars of A0 and bigger have any planets
at all, they don\'t live long enough.
2) You may get slightly less masking using First In figures than those presented
in Far Trader (based on Scouts).

This is now completely nonsense. The hull is now 250 tons, and the extra
cargo room (8.5 tons!) is used for sensors. I will have to see where I can
trim more room.

I could cut the maneuver drive down, but I think they are very paranoid about
what will be waiting for them when they jump, and they want a high agility,
highly armored ship. Maybe I am just making them too paranoid, but their
system is in the middle of a cold war.

That\'s actually a good idea if there is any possibility that your posts
will be taken for legal advice.  What\'s more important is that you quote
Shakespeare correctly in your subject line.  It should be:  First thing
we do, let\'s kill all the lawyers!

> Except that I hate the "esquire" title because its absolutely meaningless

The U.S. of course did away with inherited/noble titles when the country
was founded, but it still keeps titles based on achievement.  E.g., we
have military ranks and civilian official titles (President,
Commissioner).  Titles based on state-issued licenses are also common
(e.g., M.D., Esq., P.E., R.N., C.F.E., M.C.L.U., A.I.A.), and sometimes
have the force of law, for example when appending initials to which
you\'re not entitled to your name leads to violation of the laws against
practicing a profession or holding yourself out as practicing a
profession of which you are not a licensed member. 

(In many civil law countries, you and I will be addressed as Doctor,
because we have Juris Doctor degrees, whereas most lawyers there have
only a B.A.-level degree, and the Germans are of course nuts for titles
- -- "Herr Doktor Rechtsanwalt Bloo" has a certain ring, don\'t you think?)

"Esq." is so commonly used by American lawyers and American lawyers only
that a prosecutor could make a case that a non-lawyer using the
appendage is holding himself out as a lawyer in violation of such a
statute.  (As a practical matter, prosecutors usually have more
important things to do, like prosecuting paralegals who run self-help
legal clinics.)  

> Would there be a title, or title suffix, for members of the Imperial Bar?

You may be quite sure that the stratified, status-conscious,
Vilani-influenced Imperium has lots of titles and suffixes and stuff. 
Here\'s how I handle it:  

At the member state level there will be a lot of variation, so let\'s not
worry about it.  
Imperial judicial courts are a part of the courts of the nobility, so
only nobles (here knights or above) are allowed to practice before
them.  Non-noble lawyers may work in conjunction with noble lawyers in a
relationship similar to the barrister/solicitor relationship in Britain
and other countries that follow its model.  

Non-noble lawyers may also serve the courts directly as law clerks or
research attorneys, but will not appointed as judges; only nobles serve
as judges in Imperial courts.  

Licensing of lawyers is handled by the Imperial courts themselves, and
the nobles who set up the courts normally confer licensing authority on
the court, although some nobles retain it, or retain licensing authority
in conjunction with that of the court.  The courts decide how lawyers
are to be designated, and they all do it a little differently.

One of the Emperor title\'s is of course Supreme Judge of the Grand
Empire of the Stars, but he rarely exercises that duty, referring
matters that come before him to the Supreme Imperial Judicial Court, of
which he is the only avenue of appeal.  The Archdukes and sector and
subsector dukes are authorized by their patents of title to establish
courts in their respective domains, sectors, and subsectors, and the
relationships among those courts are in part a matter of Imperial law
and custom and in part a matter of agreement among those nobles.  

Any noble with a fief may establish whatever legal system he or she
desires; courts in fiefs are normally called "manorial courts", and
exercise both judicial and administrative functions (as well as the
butt-kissing function, a time-honored function of non-judicial courts).  

The Imperial Bar Association is not a licensing body, but a trade
association, not unlike the American Bar Association.  It produces
helpful publications (including directories), helps make mentor
connections, runs job ads, lobbies on behalf of the profession, etc. 
Members may put I.B.A. after their names, but it\'s just marketing; it
only means they\'re entitled to practice before some Imperial court and
paid the annual dues.  

So the bottom line is that lawyers practicing before Imperial courts
will have noble titles and suffixes, and each court will confer an
additional title or suffix to indicate that that person is authorized to
practice before it.  Most lawyers entitled to practice before the
Imperial courts have adopted an I.B.A.-inspired common suffix, so that
they can at least tell at a glance who is and who is not admitted to
practice before the Imperial courts.  In my Traveller universe, they
have chosen "Esq.", a title with a long history, that was carried into
the Ziru Sirka by the conquering Terrans many generations ago, and that
is not already an official title in the Imperium.

> What would the Vilani equivalent be?

The Vilani would simply translate the various titles.  Admissions to
practice before the Imperial courts are normally issued in at least High
Vilani and Galanglic, but may be in other languages as necessary.  (My
Imperium isn\'t particularly hung up on "official languages".)  "Esq."
remains "Esq."

Actually, if you want to invoke Grandfather you can do *lots* of neat
things. For example, a planet/satellite somewhat larger than the moon
could have been given a "normal" atmosphere by Grandfather, and if you
go with only slightly optimistic calculations it won\'t have thinned out
all that much in the last 300,000 years. 

Of course, such a setup *screams* TERRAFORMED to anybody with any
background in theory (or practice) of planetary surveying.

Well, albedo involves a number of factors. For example, a small random
fluctuation in albedo (say from cloud cover, or upper atmosphere dust)
can result in a runaway effect. 

More light gets reflected, planet gets cooler, more snow falls (and
*stays* through much of the summer), resulting in more light being
reflected. It\'s self-reinforcing until some factor breaks it. 

So you wind up with a planet-wide ice age. Then all that weight
pressing down causes tectonic plates to shift, and maybe you get a
major volcanic eruption that blasts dust across all that ice. This
increases the amount of light absorbed, and melts some of the ice. You
may get another re-inforcing cycle leading back to a tropical climate. 

Some of the factors that affect this sort of thing are the presence of
life, and axial tilt changes over time. That last is thought to be the
big difference between Earth and Mars. The moon stabilizes our axis, so
it changes slowly and in a simple manner. 

Mars\' axis, on the other hand, seems to wander chaotically. Leading to
wide climate flucuations.

Hmm, maybe I let the Zho\'s have a single, surviving warbot which dies in

The inventor is Trevor Bayliss, IIRC. He had a lot of trouble getting

I\'m the chucklehead that found some of the errors.  The main one I remember
is Chronor/Chronor, with a "304" listing for Pop/Planetoid/Gas giants.

According to the printed material (Megatraveller Imp Ency, G:T Behind the
Claw, and GT: Far Trader) it should be 810.

There are others, I just don\'t recall them at this time.

Anybody able to verify any of this "officially"?

That\'s ok. One of the things that had me tearing out my hair back when
the Little Black Books were new was that *nowhere* (in my copies) did
it tell you what the acceleration or duration of missiles was. The only
thing said about it was that missiles start with the same vector as the
ships that launched them. Well, duh!

As I recall, the *first* thing that ever said anything about it was the
Missiles Supplement in a fairly late JTAS. 

I suspect that this was one of those things that was so *obvious* to
the authors that it never occured to them to put it in. But it was a
major stumbling block for me.

Interesting notion.  The system in the rules is pretty much lifted from GURPS
Space, but it may be too grainy.  Something like what you use may work better.
I\'m collecting errata for SJG and optional rules for a website I\'m going to 
build.
This sounds like a good candidate.

The ship that I am referencing is the "original" Type C Cruiser from the

That thought crossed my mind as well. Immediately after the
crash, the uninjured maintenance and engineering crew will be
trying to assess condition of the ship. It\'s probably going to
take them a few hours to accept that it\'s really most sincerely
dead, and longer to figure out (and document) how and why. The
officers have responsibility for both ship and passengers, and they
may very well be initially more concerned about the ship.
Care of the passengers will be left to the medic and stewards.
BTW, I\'m not sure how many crew there are supposed to be for
about 100 passengers.  It would save me some trouble designing
this beached whale if someone has already figured this out.

I almost said something about establishing a cooperative
relationship as well. To get your ideas or suggestions across,
you can also find a leader who will listen to you, or as you
suggest, someone he will listen to.

Good point, though I\'d rather go with distinctions within the
major categories (possibly with some overlap) than restructuring
of them. IMTU the concept of noblesse oblige is alive and well;
the tension between preferential treatment of nobles and their
social obligations to the "less fortunate" more or less balance
out in emergencies.  Middle and high passengers do get treatment
before low passengers, on the theory that if low berthers aren\'t
protected by the berths, resuscitation and treatment demand
scarce medical resources and have a high failure rate.

The first time was in 1978, I owned an Apple //c, and convincing mom to buy
a modem seemed a distant dream. I doubt the TML was in operation anyway :)
Funny how in the mid to late 80\'s (IBM PC compatible, unix bourne shell
account on a system an area code away, 1200bps modem) I still never heard of
the TML.

That was the first missile question (about a month ago). I had always assumed
1G, homing (book 2 says they are homing type missiles (along with mentioning
jump capable message torpedoes)), never run out of fuel. The spreadsheet I got
from www.atlantic-online.ns.ca/traveller is mucho better, based on this JTAS.
"the JTAS with the Vargr on the front." is the best description I\'ve seen.

The 6G answer seemed to be the consensus.

The star-that-turns-into-the-white-dwarf had best be quite a way away,
since the star will get hundreds of times brighter during its red giant phase,
which would have serious climate effects (serious in the "burn the atmosphere

 None that I know of aside from the Judges Guild version (aka "the flying

and possibly the Explorer Cruiser done by FASA in Adventure Class Ships
Volume 2.
Have any ideas? Several of us architectural types could probable whip up
something. Name your configuration of choice...

 The original Type C is more "twice as much Type-T as a Type-T" than 
the troop transport Broadsword. Why it carries two ATVs in an Unstreamlined
frame is curious, but I suspect the twin Pinnaces are supposed to handle
them...

Well, I am no scientist, so your answer leads me to more questions. Are you
saying that the Si-O sequence is silicone and the Si-Si sequence is silicon?
And that the addition of oxygen allows for more complicated molecues which
may be able to reproduce themselves? How would this effect ther biochemical
make-up? Could we consider references in Traveller and other works to silicon
based life-forms as sloppy terminology for silicone based life?

Would this stability result in a lower rate of genetic drift and or

Or a more radical, very noticeable difference, the two versions of the WWII

Long chain molecules with an Si-O repeating backbone are silicones. As
in "silicone breast implants". You don\'t see long chain molecules with
an Si-Si backbone.

Just look up the properties of the various sorts of silicones, and
compare them with the analogous hydrocarbons. We\'ve mostly stuck to
making plastics and oils out of them. But they seem to be capable of
the required complexity.

Remember, I\'m assuming it needs a higher energy environment just to
react as well as carbonm compounds do at normal temperatures. So things
like degradation would likely work out to be similar.

The aliens are dealing with earth (having accidentally made contact)
because we can supply an incredibly addictive drug.

Same sort of stuff you find around LA. The result of UV catalyzed
reactions between hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds. Beyond a general
statement like that, nobody really *knows* yet. Which is why they want
another probe out there.

Those were pretty popular up thru WWII. Mainly because back then the
*tubes* needed 45-200 volts to work. Made for trouble with batteries. 
So you got to pedal or crank a generator.

The modernm incarnation only needs a little cranking for quite a bit of
time on the air.

One of the reasons for "face to face" schooling in the first place is
to "socialize" the "little monsters". And there are classes that
require "hands on" stuff (mostly arts and "shop" classes, though lab
work for science fits too).

So you\'ll still have schools. Though possibly they\'ll just be ther labs
and shops, and the kids will only attend one day a week or something
and spend more time at home working on the stuff that does work over
the net.

On the other hand, things like excercise are apt to be more important.
So they may have to attend for Phys ed.

I expect that "distance learning" will be restricted to situations
where the population is well scattered. 

I *do* expect that computer aided tests and drills will free up a lot
of teacher time though. The computer can drill the kid on the basics,
and check the "rote learning" part of the tests. That leaves more time
for the teacher to teach the kids how to *think*. And how to solve
problems, rather than look up answers.

My understanding of Esquire was that it was originaly a courtesy title
given to the (untitled) second sons of noble families. I think it got extended
to a courtesy title for most "well to do" gentlemen without other titles some
time in the early part of this century and then by extension to most men. Its
been obsolete in England for awhile now and I don\'t think it every really
caught on in the "colonies". I have no idea how it came to be used by US
lawyers. I know that the French had a traditional title for lawyers (akin to
Doctor for medical practisioners), but I can\'t for the life of me remember what
it was or if it is still used.

Yeah, except in Hollywood economics $35 mill _is_ what you give a beginner to

In the UK, I am equally at liberty to call myself Mr. Matt Clonfero or
Matt Clonfero, Esq. - they are identical.

If (by some miracle and poor judgement) I were ennobled, that would be
Sir Matt Clonfero. You can\'t use `esquire\' once you\'ve been knighted.

	None.  Distances are calculated on the shortest *navigable* route and are generally 
assumed to be based on J-2 travel since this is the cheapest way to transport freight.  
"Navigable route" means the number of parsecs a J-2 ship would actually have to travel to get 
from one world to another.

I was recently at a sake tasting in San Francisco and some excellent

be a nice shooting and drinking trip to make -- and the places are far
enough apart (2+ hrs) that there would be a very long break between the

From SS3  - Missiles in Traveller

Missile Canisters are 15cm Diameter by 1m long, with a max mass of 50kg.
Any heavier and the missile cannot go in a standard canister for launch. 3
missiles ready max (in 3 racks) per turret, with a further 12 more stored

Will have another look later to see cost etc details.

Albedo, simply put, is merely a measure of what percentage of incomeing
energy is reflected back. Any major surface coloration changes will affect
albedo. Any changes in atmospheric make up can change albedo (although not
all will). Changes in hydrographics will affect overall albedo.

in the RW, the US has significantly changed the albedo of nearly half a
continent... going from dark forests to light croplands, and other large
scale changes to the geoforms... like massive runs of black asphalt,
massive ammounts of concrete, etc. Not to mention the hoover dam...

One thing I don\'t remember specifically is what range of EM albedo is
normally measured in. (ISTR it being visible, near UV and Near IR, BIMBW).

Currently, the State of Alaska (USofA) does allow some internet-delivered
coursework. Currently, if memory serves, it is entirely private-school
driven. (There is a nasty (and quiet) lawsuit about using state provided
computers for parochial school originated classes....)

I don\'t see the abolishment of schools, however... the pattern here seems
more likely: a single teacher, supervising 20-40 kids, who do coursework in
a lab situation. At least for the higher elementary grades and up. Probably
much more individual attention for lower grades of elementary, as they
learn the skills needed for the distance delivery methods.

Ob Trav, IMTU, the education systems are world-dependant... a minimal
curriculum is mandated by the imperial gov\'t, along with the "Citizen"
exam. The IMoEd comes in and administers it once per cycle to 17yo
students, and it covers imperial history, sophont\'s rights, and basic
mathematics (4 function), as well as some minor odd bits about the
nobility, the Imperial Civil Service, etc. There is also a vocational
aptitude battery... this test is also used for determining draft status.
Then again, IMTU, there is a distinction between Citizen and Subject...

With a system like the one you\'re talking about, you might be interested in
doing some research into the Chinese civil service examination system. It\'s
really kind of interesting.

It was invented during the Han dynasty, in the first century A.D. If I
remember correctly, the exam focused on the teachings of Confucious
initially. As time progressed, more general civil service segments were
added as well. The training was expensive and time-consuming, and for
centuries it was a mark of status for a family to have at least one child
involved in the process. Later, during the Song dynasty, the exam was broken
up into several segments, and many more people were able to participate
thanks to the development of printing. The exam was broken up into three
different phases. Completion of the first two long phases guaranteed that
the exam taker would be a "white collar" worker for the rest of his life,
and excluded him from corporal punishment. The final segment was only held
at certain times and in certain places throughout the Chinese empire.

I think that such an example would be especially useful to you, since you
envision a distinct division between the "subject" and "citizen" classes.
It\'s interesting to note that elements of the Chinese system filtered to
Europe (via the Jesuits who were extremely impressed with the system) and to
a large extent is the precursor and model for all civil service exams in the
current day.

My only problem with your method is the expense. Why test everybody across
the Imperium when the potential Imperial labor pool is so small compared to
the population? You\'ve got the Imperial bureaucracy, but that pool\'s going
to be small in relation to the total population since the Imperium has a
hands-off approach to member worlds. According to canon the Imperium doesn\'t
have a huge ground-pounding army, so, again, there\'s no reason to pay the
expense to test the entire Imperium. The Imperial Navy is an amazing "force
multiplier," even with the traditional low-level of automation in the
Traveller universe. Again, I can\'t really imagine the need to test everyone
for so few jobs.

It seems to me that the Imperial mindset would work in the opposite
direction: get information about a planet\'s "best and brightest" and then
send for them to be tested on the subsector level. Ultimately, even then
there\'d be more warm bodies than jobs needing to be filled (IMHO)... of
course the megacorporations might stick their noses in and get second
choice, or "headhunt" the most qualified for Imperial service.

Just an observation, not an attack.

It\'s obvious that Sweetpea was never really interested in Traveller the

onto which any daft Hollywood plotline could be bolted willy-nilly; with
lots of potential for spinning off associated merchandise.

I\'m fairly amazed that their D&D production has attracted the interest of
an actor with the stature and ability of Jeremy Irons. I\'ll be even more
astounded if the movie ever gets made  (though with Irons on board, they
might actually swing the financing). And I\'ll be knocked flat if the film
actually turns out to be any good.

But will they hire Chris Foss to do the poster? ;)

Funny how just after I mentioned "the JTAS with the Vargr on the front." I
also posted the material from Mayday related to it, and the SS3 material.

They should be in the last four weeks digests.

I also posted the JTAS No. - 21 IIRC

I wrote a BASIC program that generates solar systems around 1989 but had

OK, we know that on a Main Route (G:FT) we get literally billions of tons
of trade per year.  On a non-Ag/Ag paired route, this will amount to many
millions of tons of foodstuffs going out from the Ag world, presumably in
bulk freighters, simiar to real-world grain ships.

What comes back ?

There\'s no way that a non-Ag world, even an Industrial one, can fill the
hold of a returning freighter with enough sellable cargo.

Take, for example, Rhylanor and Porozlo trading with Belizo, three parsecs
away.  Two non-Ag worlds with a high population trading with a low-pop ag
world, for a combined BTN total of 18 into Belizo, and 9 into the other two
worlds.  What could either of the former worlds produce, in what sort of
volumes, that the latter would want ?

Belizo does not need up to 10 billion dtons of processed goods a year, it
won\'t use them.  The Mcorps that presumably run the ships, even if they are
"merely" large corps, would want to put as much into their holds as
possible for the return trip to Belizo.  Makes sense.  An empty ship makes
you no money.  Bit of a quandry.

The one thing I can think of, is sh*t.  Nearly 30 billion people on two
relatively small worlds produce a great deal of waste.  If they\'re at all
environmentally concious, they probably don\'t want to pump it all into the
oceans.  You could ship that back for treatment.  This could involve
turning it into fertilizer, or even some sort of useful industrial product.

Anyone out there have any ideas on this ?

Just a thought.

Give the people a means to mass-produce copies of the written word and

If you want to, give them a kick start in areas they know little of.  Metal
working, mining, medical knowledge, basic scientific and principles,

Well, you do have to remember that a world is a closed system.  It doesn\'t just
magically produce stuff, it merely converts what is present into a usuable
form.  In the case of an ag world, carbon dioxide and water being turned into
sugar at its simplest form.  If you don\'t return the carbon and hydrogen to the
planet (in the form of waste) eventually the ecosystem will break down.
Likewise, if you bleed off all that oxygen through photosynthesis, and you
don\'t have something to convert it back into CO2, eventually, you\'ll get
dangerous levels of O2 out there.  A sustainable ag world would essentially
sell chemical energy.  You must deliver raw materials which the ag world would
convert into chemical energy for you.  The industrial world would use the
energy to produce work and return the expended chemical energy delivery system
to the ag world for recharging.

You\'re thinking greenhouse.

Albedo is how much light reflects. You can tweak this by changing the
ground cover, and the factor you use for clouds (which is 40-80%, IIRC).

I was always under the belief that it was used by the descendents of a
knight.  Certainly, that\'s the version of events given to me by one who
claims the title.  As to it being a legal title, I\'ve heard of no

You\'re right I was. Silly me. I don\'t have B6:Scouts (yet), does it cover
greenhouse effects as well?

Right, it\'s all coming back to me now, and there have been other good posts on
this topic. 40-80% what? Coverage of planet? Reflection of light?  What
determines the range? I get the feeling you mean reflection, and that this
would be governed by average percentage cloud cover. Hydrographics would affect
this too, right? Polar caps as well? Percentage industrialization? Are albedo
and greenhouse complimentary? I mean do their factors affect one another? Is
there some golden ratio between the two?

Jim, as far as I can understand it, your position as co-designer of the GT 
model is that higher TL goods are available on demand (maybe through mail 
order) but that the low income of such low TL worlds militates against such 
demand, so that such goods are still not pervasive.

My take on this is that, 
a) in the past and depending on YTU, Traveller players have been subject to 
availability constraints.
Removing those constraints, albeit with ordering delays, etc., changes the 
"flavour" of the universe. This is irrelevant of any economic argument.
b) from an economic point of view, having established that demand is 
necessarily low, many organisations may not partake in the supply of goods 
from high TL worlds to low TL worlds, and this militates against easy 
availability full stop.
c) development of markets on low TL worlds is further slowed by lack of 
supporting infrastructure for (possibly) distribution, support and supply of 
corequisite goods & services. Granted, increases in demand my result in 
development of supporting infrastructure, but this requirement acts as an 
additional barrier or brake.
d) therefore, and probably this does not matter anyway, there is no large 
scale (definitions below) conveyance of very high TL goods (an arbitrary limit 
would be two levels above the target TL, which fits the Book 3 discussion on 
this) and one-off orders might be satisfied by either smaller (single or 
several ship) lines at a premium, or the traveller equivalent of FedEx. Note 
that private FedEx type organisations also subject to point c) above, and this 
in turn may mean that demand may not be serviced by any delivery mechanism.
e) but, given there are worlds with low GWPs AND which cannot support 
themselves in the supply of life essentials, there must be economically viable 
large scale (defs below) freight services of life essentials.

I hasten to add that this is my opinion.

They\'re allowed to run their own army but I don\'t believe they\'re allowed to 
use them against each other. So worlds in the imperial core are probably not 
going to run large armies unless they are (literally) balkanised.

Er, I was also once an economics undergraduate. Food prices at the commodity 
level are subject to medium to long term speculative influences based on 
harvest predictions and on over/underproduction variables which aren\'t obvious 
at planting time. And of course to variations in demand. In my *opinion*, 
local (ie local to the supplying world ) prices for such goods will be as 
volatile as they are today, depending on the TL of the world (assuming higher 
TL worlds can iron out some of the risk factors in agricultural production).

Again in my opinion, given the shipping delay, and the inelastic demand at the 
target world, someone shipping such goods has alot of information to aid in 
deciding whether to go ahead, and the extent to which the price can be 
determined, ie they can\'t change production to match conditions, but they can 
decide whether to ship or not, at least against a 2 week planning cycle. And 
since there are not that many Ag worlds around, they can switch supply between 
markets based on their knowledge of price.

So although mass freight of essentials (and the business behind it) is 
probably not the highest-premium activity, per tonne of good, it is a fairly 
safe one.

Sorry. My (grossly oversimplified) definitions:
large scale - sufficient to support general availability, or availability on 
demand of goods
medium scale - sufficient to satisfy a single large order
small scale - one off items of business

Yes, I said I was stumbling :-). But my position was that 
- - there should be no large scale freight of high TL goods from high TL worlds 
to low TL worlds, under the definitions set out just above.
- - However there must be large scale freight of life essentials to worlds which 
cannot produce them locally (including the poorer low TL worlds)
- - There may also be large scale freight of life essentials and raw materials 
from low TL worlds to industrial worlds, given that these worlds are probably 
using more of certain items than they can produce locally. However in the case 
of raw materials it may be cheaper to mine other worlds in the same system 
rather than engage in interstellar trade.

You\'re right. I should have made it clear that I was focussing on the specific case of moving high TL goods to low TL worlds.

   Actually the people they "hired" were suppose to take care of the game

to be in a position to have to run a game company.

   Err...I wouldn\'t exactly say "stature" given that he hasn\'t had a hit
movie in some time.  Actors do movies on occasion to make Porsche payments
afterall, or just to get their face on screen.  Given the budget of this
production and the subject nature, we are not talking about an \'A\' movie,
nor are we talking about something with serious artistic merit that would
rate a name actor working for a lot less.  No, I\'d say he\'s doing this one
just to keep his name visible.

   I predict a brief appearance in a multiplex in Torrance, California
followed by an immediate release on video.  It may even make the money back
that was put into producing it if they can dupe WotC to sell the videos
through their distributors.  Naturally I would expect that Mr. Irons would
appear at GenCon for a special appearance/video launch celebration if that
is the case.

>But will they hire Chris Foss to do the poster? ;)

   Only if he can recycle more of the stuff he did back in 1978--there were
times I wondered if he even produced *any* new art for IG.

In Aussie, it was common enough for male school children to have Esquire
tagged onto their names, but usually in the fashion your mother uses your
full name when you are in some kind of trouble (James Warren Mark Marmaduke
Thistlethorn*!  Come here right this minute young man!), at least, as I
recall it.  I do remember education correspondence having Esquire attached
to my name once also?

*Fictional name, my apologies to any real James Warren Mark Marmaduke
Thistlethorn, living or dead, should they have really been lumbered with
such a cumbersome name not of their choosing.

Otherwise, I don\'t believe it caught on to well Downunder, but I know it was
once used under certain circumstances :^)

Yeah, OK.  I accept that worlds *should* be a closed system, and
realistically, one billion dtons outgoing a year probably is not going to
make a great deal of difference to a complete world system.

What I was sort of getting at, leaving aside the bio/chem issue, is would
it be seen as realistic for bulk freighter to be transporting waste back
from non-Ag and industrial worlds for processing and use on Ag worlds ?  In
the case of Belizo, BtC says something about the vulcanism giving the soils
a rich texture and abundant productivity.  Ergo, would they really need the
waste products ?  3I farming techniques would surely take into account soil
productivity and its\' tolerance for continued use.  That is, I\'m sure that
they\'ve worked out what crops to plant where to get the best yields, and
when to leave ground fallow.  If they have their techniques down pat, do
they really need all that fertilizer ?

Also, in the vein of your last sentence, would it be reasonable to assume
that industrial waste from primary and secondary industries is hauled back
to the point of origin of the raw materials ?  Would they haul back
chemical slag from the industrialised planets to the mining planets or
asteroid belts ?  Even in a really efficient production cycle, yer going to
have some waste products that can\'t be used or utilised on the
industrialised planets.

This was thrashed out in the GT:FT playtest, back when G:T FT was GT:Trade
and Commerce, over the specific issue of Tarsus/Collace. In the end, it was
decided that BTN can never exceed the smaller WTN plus 5. This made it at
the bottom of p 15 of the printed version.

Therefore, in this case, it\'s a max BTN of 9.0, so exports from Belizio to
Rhylanor is 9 flat, or 1-500 000 dtons a year. My trusty Regency Sourcebook
says Belizio has 900 000 people, so thats about half a dton of stuff each,
or about 7 m3. Same story for Porozolo.

You calculate BTNs seperately, so it\'s two 9 flat BTNs, not an 18 BTN.

Incidentally, the stuff coming back wont make a big impact on the food
input of your average Porozolan. Assuming 20 billion Porozolans, the 250
000 dtons of food imports from Belizio turns into about ummm 2 kilos each ?

Yeah. Send em dirt bikes, combine harvesters and land rovers instead.

The other option is to wear the empty space coming back. If you make a
profit of Cr 2400 per jump, then it\'s worthwhile to carry empty space back
(the balance-of-trade issue can be solved by assuming the dominant economy
owns the production facilities on the peripheral world).

I\'m not really talking about the fertilizer.  Plants don\'t actually take much out
of the soil, they feed almost entirely on water and CO2.  You\'ve got to replenish
the those elements in a form usable by the Ag planet.  A decent form would be
alcohol CHOOH, which could be used as fuel (but what\'s the point with fusion
plants?)

Mining planets are kinda notorious for being inhospitable.  The companies come in,
strip it clean and dump any undesirable waste back there.  The ecosystem isn\'t
really a concern there.

	Horse hockey. There\'s no time travel at all involved, any more than
there is with recording something six years ago, and then replaying
it today. Neither I nor the information in question have in any way
traveled in time except in the usual "1 second per second" rate ...

Well, it _is_ the Spinward Marches sourcebook, so in an OTU campaign set
somewhere else it would be not so useful. In an Non-OTU campaign, just set
somewhere else, there are several hundred worlds described in considerable
detail...just file off the names and serial numbers and they can be plonked in
just about anywhere. Same for many of the adventure seeds and plot hints.

It\'s detailed down to word generation tables to generate Vargr and Zhodani
words and names. There are lots of details on political and social structures
in both groups, but not a lot _explicitly_ on how they interact, these books
show how they\'ll act, you take that into your TU for the interaction. The
minor races are pretty good IMHO, about ten pages each for the three minors
presented, two, however, are somewhat removed from the Imperium, being
situated coreward. The Sheol, the gas giant critters, are in the Spinward Marches.

There\'s no generic Alien-building instructions. First In has some
race-building details, though.

ARI also has a bonus section on Psionics rules.

I have found a thread I have some practical knowledge in, cool. Farming tecniques
involve fertilizer, silly! By supplamenting the soils nutritional value (for
crops) with fertilizer, you increase its tolerance to continued use, as well as
boost that seasons output. Rotating crops and leaving the ground fallow are ways
to compensate for the fact that various crops consume different nutrients in
different ratios. As far as intersteller agriculture is concerned, you may have a
demand within a region for a crop that can not be grown effectively on any Ag
worlds near enough to make distribution economically feasible unless you enrich
some worlds soil. Vulcanism does enrich soil, but we are talking grand scale
here. On a season by season basis you want mulch. It would be difficult to bring
a world with nutrient-poor soil up to Ag status, so some worlds would never be
utilized for food production, but even a fertile world could use a boost.

"Waste", or byproducts, need not be hauled to the place of origin so much as a
place of deficit in said byproduct. Perhaps back to the origin point, perhaps
further down the line.

And what about hydroponic stations in orbit in systems with no other Ag
abilities? We (3I) are high tech, aren\'t we?

A Major Route (BTN 10) generates 5 million dtons/year at maximum.
A 12.5 Route would generate 1 billion dtons/year at maximum.
The best the Spinward Marches do anywhere that I have found is
Rhylanor - Porozlo with a BTN of 12; 100 million - 500 million dtons/year.

With significant routes from Trin, Mora, Glisten, Lunion, and Strouden
all culminating at Rhylanor and Porozlo, you might be moving billions
of dtons/year through that area, but its not all on the same route.

Perhaps you meant to say billions in Credits/Year, which is certainly
true.

"The credit value of bilateral trade is constrained to be the same on both ends
of the route (balanced trade), but the physical dton volume can vary on either
end, since worlds may export things with different value densities.  For
instance, an industrial world might export a tiny volume of agricultural
machinery to an agricultural world and receive a huge volume of grain in
return."

You don\'t add BTNs in this way.  2 9\'s do not make 18.  They don\'t even make
9.5.

Rhylanor - Belizo: BTN 9 (6 + 4 + 0.5 = 10.5 - 1 = 9.5): 9.0 Max (4 + 5 = 9)
Credits/Yr: 1G-5G  Dtons/Yr: 100k-500k  Dtons/Week: 5k-10k

Porozlo - Belizo: BTN 9 (6 + 4 = 10 - 1 = 9): 9.0 Max (4 + 5 = 9)
Credits/Yr: 1G-5G  Dtons/Yr: 100k-500k

Totals
Credits/Yr: 2G-10G  Dtons/Yr: 200k-1M

Not so bad a picture as you initially painted.

Okay, then I might pick it up and check it out eventually. Since my campaign
is set in Daibei, the information on the Zhodani and Vargr is of limited
utility. The Aslan, on the other hand are a bit more immediate and that
one\'s supposed to be out soon.

Yeah. I\'m slugging through First In and I\'m getting a warm fuzzy feeling.

Yes and yes. It\'s extremely similar to Mercenary in terms of the type of content
covered.

It\'s the Spinward Marches sourcebook. Given the importance of the Marches in
recent (as of 1116) imperial history I guess it might have use outside. There
are one or two paras on every world in the marches, plus write ups of the
non-Imperial territories, on local minor races (some new) and of recent history
(ie the FFW).

There\'s more detail than the GDW alien modules, but for the Vargr less than in
the DGP Vilani & Vargr module (or it feels like less, whatever, I prefer the DGP
volume).

> Are the other races included fleshed out and useful in campaigns?

3 other races, by David Pulver - the Drakarans, the Sheol and the Clotho. The
Drakarans and the Sheol first appeared in the Space Master module Aliens and
Artifacts, which I personally find annoying. The Clotho are meant to be the
Addaxur, mentioned in earlier texts on the Zhodani. All the aliens are
interesting in several aspects but in general the writing lacks a certain
something that I can\'t quite put my finger on, and as a result the new aliens
don\'t mesh so well (IMHO). But they\'re usable with some work.

> Is there any generic stuff on building races specifically for Traveller, and
> pointers about how races interact with the Imperium?

No. The official answer seems to be to go to Compendium I, but my strong
recommendation is to try and get hold of (the sadly out of print) GURPS Uplift.
These will allow some generation of generic aliens, though you then have to do
the work to fit them to the Imperial background.

Also you haven\'t mentioned Far Trader, which is probably at the same level as
First In in terms of potential usefulness, and which I\'d probably recommend
ahead of all the above (with the exception of Uplift). Plus the genuine GURPS
players also recommend Compendium II, UltraTech, UltraTech II, Vehicles, Robots
and just maybe Space if you\'re looking to play the game rather than glean
background. At which point you may also need GURPS Lottery Winner (not that I
haven\'t spent a fortune on Traveller stuff anyway).

In backwaters like the marches, it would be a pain... except that the test
proctor is probably also the local scout administrator or his appointees.

In major areas, administered by appointees from neighboring worlds...
Assuming a single individual can conduct tests for 500 students in a week
(The US ASVAB is done this way often... 2 proctors, 2 days of 5 hours each,
250 students), and shipping him cost ~Cr8000 each way, plus Cr2000 per
month wage...not too bad. If you grab from neighboring school districs,
costs drop even further... Figure roughly KCr18 per  2000 students, that\'s
only Cr18 per student. Or less. And with massive automation in the
classroom, such exams would be proctored by, essentially, isolating the
machines to be used from the nets after backing it up, wiping and
installing the test, running it for the students (possibly 2 or 3 shifts a
day), and then downloading the results, and wiping the machine. On major
worlds, there would be nearly constant testing (much like the testing
schedule for SAT/ACT/NTE exams); minor worlds get a proctor once or twice a
year...

Then again, IMTU, citizenship\'s primary benefit is the right to noble
appeal. Subjects have most of the other protections, but being able to
appeal any sentence (civil or criminal) to the local noble is quite a boon,
especially since you can appeal to HIS boss. (In writing, at own expense.
If he feels it worth a hearing, he sends an inquisitor or subpoena\'s you
and the prosecutor to his court.) Subject are simply going to be stuck.
Also, I figure any careers that take you off world will be once where
citizenship is essential... that protection is vital in the volatility of
the late 3I. It also gives a reason to put up with the arrogance, and
either stuffiness or partying of the nobiolity.


and as for headhunting, I figure the imperial citizen to be the most common
in off worlders... simply because the test IS NOT HARD. And, unless one
puts in 2 or more yearsof "Creditable Service" (which may not even take one
off the homeworld), the test is moot... the protections of citizens are not
for the common prole, but for the common burguoise...

don\'t even get me started on nobles IMTU.... too many years of divergence.

My understanding was that the proper usage of "Esquire" is limited to
unmarried adult males. Now, I don\'t know if that\'s true or not, but it\'s
what I always heard. And a leading magazine devoted to the lifestyle of
bachelorhood is called -- Esquire. (Hugh Hefner was on its staff for a few
years before going off to start a magazine of his own, one with content
very similar to Esquire, but with the addition of certain types of
photographical essays, the nature of which I will not mention here...)  :-D

Understandable, although even without SJG\'s priorities it might be a little

different versions of Traveller.

Okay, good. I didn\'t get a really good look at it when I visited my FLGS

Okay. As I said in another response, this is likely going to go on the back
burner for a while. I\'ve already got a fair amount of non-GURPS Trav stuff
and I have all of the detail on the Spinward Marches I think I\'ll need.

Thanks. I kind of wanted to know how it would stack up to the DGP material,

that makes any sense).

Cool. Thanks for the recommendation. I\'ll keep an eye out for Uplift when I
poke around for out of print material. I\'ve already got Compendium I, but I
was just wondering if there might be detailed coverage of some specific
Traveller issues, maybe more in depth coverage on the status of "minor
races" in the Imperium, stuff like that.

I didn\'t mention it because I\'d already made up my mind to get it. ;)

I poked through the playtest files on Pyramid, but just never got around to
getting it when it came out. When I went shopping last night, I had
originally intended to get Far Trader but First In\'s world generation system
really grabbed me.

Hehe... Fortunately I\'ve got all of the above, except Ultra-Tech II which I
am supposed to get as a present from somebody. I had a busy Christmas this
year ;)

Thanks muchly for the response, it was very helpful.

	True.  There are still enough barriers to importing hi-tech goods 
(time, interstellar payments system, etc.) that it\'s not trivially easy and 
a determined GM can keep hi-tech equipment difficult to get.  IMHO, hi-tech 
goods should never be treated like D&D "magic items."  The Imperium is a 
mature, space-faring, hi-tech civilization and with enough money one can 
acquire any legal piece of technology desired.

	No arguments.  This is what I\'m saying about how if you really wanted 
to, you could import anything, but that the tech still isn\'t pervasive 
because it\'s expensive and inconvenient.

Certainly.

	Fair enough.  They\'re still likely to have some internal security 
forces though.  Canada still has an army even though they have no foreign 
security commitments and no fear of invasion.

	You\'re essentially describing interstellar arbitrage, which is an 
important underlying assumption of GT:FT.  See the Ch.2 sidebar "Law of One 
Price."  The implication is that average prices equilibrate across systems, 
in the medium- to long-term, but that prices at any particular point in time 
are unlikely to be the same.  

The sort of commodity speculation you\'re describing can also be modeled 
using GT:FT.  See the Ch.2 sidebar "Price Series,":

  "The price series system is included to model the movement of freight 
rates and ticket prices, but it has other applications.  If the players want 
to speculate in groat hides or lanthanum, the GM can set up a price series 
and let them buy and sell."  

By extension, all of the rules on spot and futures markets, predicting the 
future, etc. could also be used.

>Sorry. My (grossly oversimplified) definitions:

on

Okay.

>Yes, I said I was stumbling :-). But my position was that 
>- there should be no large scale freight of high TL goods from high TL 
worlds 
>to low TL worlds, under the definitions set out just above.

	I agree that everyone on a GTL-8 world isn\'t walking around with GTL-
12 personal communicators.  But if the government of a GTL-8 world wanted to 
equip its army with GTL-12 communicators, the only significant barrier would 
be money (asuming they\'re on a trade route).

>- However there must be large scale freight of life essentials to worlds 
which

	I don\'t doubt that some worlds may be dependent on imported food and 
raw materials.

materials

	That may be, but we can assume inhospitable worlds were settled for a 
good reason.  See the Ch.2 sidebar "Standard of Living: Labor Productivity, 
Natural Capital, and Tech Level."  In short, we can make up social or 
political reasons for the first few instances of settled inhospitable 
worlds, but after a while these become strained and we are force to admit 
that there must be reasonable economic motivations for developing these 
worlds.

	If you are along a J-4 route (ie. x-boat route) then yeah, stuff goes 
J-4.  Otherwise, information, like everything else, goes J-2 by default.  
But see the notes on establishing routes in Ch.2 on when there may be J-3 
links.

For those that missed previous postings over the last several months, I just 
opened a FLGS with a sucessful first week-end.     
   As a proud member of the Traveller Geezer Club, I\'ve of course provided 
Traveller (GT) a promenent position. Also on display (but not for sale) is my 
autographed TAS Alien Encyclopedia (#15), a hardbound GT signed by Mr\'s 
Miller, Jackson, and Wiseman, and painted sets of Grenadier Imperial Marines 
and Alien Mercenaries. My GDW Vargr poster will be added as soon as it is 
framed.
   Like many, having my own store has been a long time dream.  I\'m lucky 
enough to have a spouse that told me to "make my avocation my vocation". 
Imagine that, and her not even a gamer. The store is 2400 sq ft with six 
gaming tables (two are terrain), a catalog area with comfy reading chairs and 
the normal sodas and junk food. Late hours on Fridays and Saturdays and 12-5 
for Sunday gamers. In addition to the RPG\'s and comics, I also have a sword 
and armor section and anime. I\'ve tried to make it a store I\'d want to shop 
in. 
   Many on the list provided advice and suggestions for which I can only say 
repeatedly Thank You, Thank You, Thank You......it\'s meant very sincerely. 
Many of the ideas have been incorporated into the store. 
   In particular, thanks to Sword Worlder of the Subsidized Merchant. Lots of 
help, encouragement, and suggestions over an extended period of time. Most of 
all, a sense of humor and enthusiasm. If you haven\'t already done so, please 
visit his site at downport.com.
   My own website is still in the works (medievalstarship.com), but I can be 
reached at starship@intertek.net or 618-632-3026. Now if you\'ve read this 
far, I do have a shameless plug. Anyone placing a order with Medieval 
Starship that mentions the TML will receive a 10% discount on in print 
material. Mailing will be at actual cost. Open every day except Monday. Right 
now all I\'m set up to handle is new material but when my stock of OOP hits a 
critical mass I\'ll be listing it as well (I haven\'t decided yet if my extra 
JTAS #1 will be included).
  Thanks also for your patience with this off topic self indulgence.

A great place to look for used GURPS books and Traveller (although harder 
to filter), is EBay.  There is usually a copy or two of Uplift on there 
every couple of weeks (although not as I write this).

No, due to that last paragraph on page 15, the Rhylanor-Porozlo route only 
comes to a BTN of 11, generating 10-50 million dtons per year.

OK, I\'ll learn not to think about these things and commit them to the
written word after 3:00am.  Lesson #1 - Read the Book.  My bad.

While on 21/6/99 Ian Whitchurch said :

What I sort of envisaged was Belizo making up the shortfall in Porozlo\'s
agricultural production.  Like we (and the US and Canada) do for Russia.

OK, that\'s what I was after.  I was coming at it from the POV of a small
trader, rather than a corporate, who can afford to absorb the losses
better.  I see the returns (of physical goods) being equal in value, but
extremely unequal in dtons, so I was wondering if the corporate ships would
just wear that or not.  I suppose real-world sheep ships don\'t bring
anything back from the Mideast, do they ?

Whilst on 20/6/99, Hypercleats said :

I wouldn\'t have thought so.  Maybe shot off into nearby stars using "sun
guns" ?
I \'spose it depends on how ecologically-minded you see the 3I.  I would
tend to think they don\'t leave huge piles of industrial waste lying about
for the kiddies to play in.  Probably ship it to planets that have no-one
and/or no potential.

 Stutterwarp as presented in FF&S1 was derived from 2300AD
(aka Traveller: 2300). That setting doesn\'t have artificial gravity
as I recall, so the question doesn\'t come up. Since you are doing
your own setting, the tech interacts the way you want/need it to.
You can set the discharge range for your stutterwarp (7 lightyears
for 2300AD, several years for Star Trek, who knows for Dominic
Flandry\'s "Hooligan"), how it interacts with artificial gravity vs.
natural, what rates of travel are possible, etc.
  Bottom line. Make it up. Then write it down. Otherwise you\'ll never
be able to relate it to your players/readers/whatever...

If I could, I\'d be up for a Nobel prize. 

We don\'t *really* have much more than *estimates* for a lot of this
stuff. We *know* that a large enough volcanic eruption can throw dust
into the air and cause massive cooling. Several eruptions in the last
200 years have had measurable cooling effect on the world climate. One,
back in 1818 or so led to 1819 being known as "the year without a
summer". They had things like snow in *july* in the northern temperate
zone! 

Likewise, we know that CO2 and other gases help trap heat via the
greenhouse effect. 

And it is *thought* that increased cloud cover and ice/snow that lasts
over the summer starts a cycle that leads to an ice age. 

Your best bet is to look up things like climatalogy, ice ages,
greenhouse effect, "nuclear winter", and the like.

Albedo values for cloud are 0.40 to 0.80, with the cloudiness percentage
determined by hydrographics.

When I was designing worlds this way, I\'d always calculate max/min
temperatures (by tweaking all variables as much as possible in each
direction), then pick the temperature I wanted between there, then
backtract to the actual factors I needed.

Possibly not. OTOH, if the ship is going back there anyway, all you\'re
paying is handling charges. This might make it economically worthwhile.

Hauled somewhere, possibly.

IIRC, the present or past Chairman of the Federal Reserve (forget which
guy) once said that it was cheaper to dispose of toxic waste in Third World
countries, because accidents were less costly there (and that it was good
for the countries, because they got some scarce foreign exchange at the
cost of some abundant people, or words to that effect). While I doubt he\'s
the only capitalist/economist to \'write off\' Third World citizens like
that, he was more blatant than anyone else I\'ve heard of.



ObTrav: A poor low tech planet, next to an industrial one, gets a waste
reprocessing plant as foreign aid. The locals aren\'t told all the dangers
by their leaders (who are busy fattening their offworld bank accounts) and
the mortality rate is climbing, although no one knows quite why.

The players are demobbed scouts, contacted by a friendly noble. They are
asked to have a quiet poke around to determine if there is enough evidence
to warrant Imperial intervention.

The players can gather evidence, but there is nothing actually illegal
going on (just unethical). Remember that the Imperium is laisser faire
about things like this. Further actions will vary depending on the players.
Commando raids, political action, public appeals, economic actions...

Are you sure about that? Both have a WTN of 6. That would indicate a 
BTN of 11. Far Trader says smallest WTN + 5. That would seem to make 
a 12 impossible unless there were two WTN\'s of 7.

That is so cold-blooded. I love this as a bit for a Traveller  campaign.
Typical Skin-monkey behavior, and I doubt Vilani Skin-monkeys are any more
ethical than the Solomani, although I think the Zodhani are less likely to
think this way due to their societal structure. Other forms of evil for that
lot.

Write it up! this is a great core for a Traveller module. Actually it can be
many modules with a few tweaks here and there.

Correct.  I don\'t read my own posts.

Another possible spin could have the players getting caught in a little
confrontation between the local reprocessing plant and some "well-meaning"
activist group while transporting a load of waste.

What if the players got stuck with the load of waste after a settlement is
reached? hehehe

As a "genuine GURPS player" I think I would heavily qualify this.
The books mentioned are useful, but you can easily get by without
them.  I might say that I would encourage either Space or
Compendium II stuff but beyond that you certainly don\'t need
them for a campaign, but they can be useful.

My response:

Only one problem with the above scenario is that I expect that most nasty
waste in Traveller gets dealt with just like we do it right now.    It gets
burned in as hot a furnace as can be arranged.  In Traveller it would be
dropped into the nearest nuclear furnace, a convenient star.  Now if you
want to have a scenario where a loose load of radioactive waste, mega death
in a large economy sized can, from a shifty but well connected company ends
up on a collision course with a populated planet and everyone wants the
problem settled quietly, before it hits the atmosphere if you don\'t mind,
that is another story.

Extract (c) New Scientist   5 June 1999
http://www.newscientist.com/ns/19990605/feedback.html

SOMETHING VERY ODD seems to be happening in the world of
                          nuclear physics. Here is a list of recent papers
that have appeared in physics
                          journals, kindly supplied by reader Michael John
Gifford.

                          "Penguin topologies, rescattering effects and
penguin hunting" (Nuclear
                          Physics B); "Space-like penguin effects in Bc
decays" (European Physics
                          Journal C); "Charming-penguin enhanced B decays"
(Nuclear Physics B);
                          "How to trap a non-standard penguin? Isospin
symmetry violations in B-decays
                          with enhanced chromomagnetic dipole operator"
(Physics Letters B); "The
                          self-penguin contribution to K*2?" (Physics
Letters B); "Spacelike penguin
                          diagram effects in B*?? decays" (Physical Review D).

                          What is going on, you may ask. The answer, it
turns out, is that a penguin is
                          not necessarily a bird that lives in the
Antarctic. It is also a type of diagram that
                          maps interactions between nuclear particles. The
first such diagram apparently
                          resembled a penguin, hence these bizarre titles.

                          But while we\'re on the subject, let us not forget
the feathered variety of
                          penguin. When he was gathering the titles listed
above, Gifford also came
                          across several papers about penguins in the
Antarctic. He was particularly
                          struck by: "Cocktail-party effect in king penguin
colonies" (Proceedings of the
                          Royal Society B).

                          One way or another, there\'s more to penguins than
meets the eye.

If the shipper is already atleast breaknig even on the round trip, they
will fill the hold with anything that will earn more than it costs to
ship rather than send it back empty.  (cost to ship will include
loading, unloading, manuever losses (manuever time due to higher mass or
extra manuever fuel), time losses, etc.).  If they can make an extra
10Cr / dTon then they would fill the hold with anything, as it is
profit.

One option would be using "collapsible" or "disposable" storage.  By mating
cargo modules to "zero-cargo" vessel, you can deliver them and leave without
worrying about "empty cargo"  It would be a more efficient return trip, but
you\'re still going back empty handed.

If I understand the concept of "tidally-locked" correctly, I would
probably use the Terra-Luna relationship as an [incomplete] example. 
Thus, each portion of the moon\'s surface would, barring eclipses by the
parent world, be exposed to sunlight for about half the time it takes
said moon to orbit the parent world.

Obviously, gas giants are more likely than Terran-type rockballs to
eclipse their moons, so this is an incomplete analogy.  It does,
however, give one a starting point from which to work.

Given that Terran life forms have varied limb forms in non-endoskeletal
animals, yet are invariably quadrapedal (including arms/wings/vestigal
limbs) in endoskeletal animals, I would suspect that there was an actual
evolutionary advantage for quadripedal vertebrates.  Why this would be
is beyond my knowledge.  However, if forced to speculate, I owuld
probably conclude that vertebrate life forms will evolve to have the
minimum number of limbs required for that life form to fulfill its
ecological niche.  On Terra, that appears to be four limbs, in general,
for endoskeletal animals.  Your planet may vary.

Assume that the moon\'s orbital period is 100 hours.  At point "A", which we
will assume is on the equator, we\'ll start with the moon directly between
the GG and the star, with A at "high noon."

As the moon orbits, A will slide away from the star until the sun seemingly
sets.  This will occur when the Moon is 90 degrees from the start position.
 A will remain in darkness for another 180 degrees, when the sun "rises"
So half the orbital period would work.

Now take point "B", on the equator facing the planet.  The same basic rule
applies, but B will deal with an eclipse once an orbit.  The duration of
this eclipse depends on the size of the GG and the diameter of the orbit.

>3) Is there any possible reason for evolution to (seemingly ;) favor a
>quadrapedal form over a hexapedal form?

The vast majority of species on Earth are hexapodal.  Insects uber alles!!
AFAIK, there\'s now year reason, just happened to be how the majority of
large species on Earth developed.

Rotation period will be equal to the moon\'s orbital period around the gas
giant.  You can probably approximate the effective orbital period with respect
to the primary star by taking the gas giant\'s orbital period around the 
primary.
The "local calendar" rules in First In will carry you through then.  Remember
that a tide-locked world won\'t rotate retrograde.

No guess.  My metallurgy is wobbly and I don\'t have any good references
right at hand.

Not that I\'m aware of.  There\'s no reason to expect hexapedal critters to
be any more clumsy, for example -- spiders have more limbs than that
and they\'re quite agile.  My guess is that Terran vertebrates are basically
four-limbed for no better reason than random chance.

What, are you trying to write up the Aion?  :-).

This doesn\'t quite work, because you\'re neglecting the gas giant\'s orbital 
motion
around the primary.

Does this make economic sense?  If you\'re going to send your waste
off-planet, why not just shove it towards the sun?  I guess it depends
on what the waste is.  Maybe there is something worth extracting from it
that justifies the expense.

I did post to the list that in my Traveller universe, the Roswell
incident in 1947 was the crash of a Vilani vessel.  That might be a fun
scenario to play out, with the PCs as either the injured Vilani crew
trying to get a message home or as USAF personnel or as outsiders trying
to figure out what happened.

Once fusion power is readily available, no.
Plasma torch the waste and recycle the raw material stream.

Mine landfills, etc. if you don\'t have access to fusion power.
Bioremediation. Etc.

Fissile materials can be put into breeder reactors and more fuel
generated. Given the long history of civilisation in Charted Space, this
has to be going on (thorium -> uranium 233, uranium 238 to plutonium,
etc.) otherwise all the heavy radionuclides would have run out.

[Tbousands of years of continued occupancy implies some attempt at
environmental management].

With sufficient velocity a tin of baked beans or confetti will be \'mega

Remember that your radioactive waste needs to be optimally dispersed. It
is unlikely to be prepared in such a manner to enable this. Contrast
this to BW agents that Ken Alibek describes in his book (a former
director of the Soviet biological warfare program).

Or it may only justify the expense if you can stick someone else with the
dangers.

Besides, the sun is off-planet. I think you mean out-system, another whole
ballgame, much more expensive.

  A cynic might point out that at least the Vilani were honest enough to

almost shudders to imagine what Vilani apologists pass off for ideology.

Sorry i didn\'t I dentify the waste.  If it is organic without an admixture
of metals, i.e. spent solvents,  biologicals, etc. it would still probably
get burned.  That is the simplest and most certain solution.

>Mine landfills, etc. if you don\'t have access to fusion power.
>Bioremediation. Etc.

Mines,  landfills, etc. are storage solutions they don\'t necessary solve the
problem just contain it for the short term i.e. 10, 20, 50, 100 years.
Unless other processes reduce the problem, natural degragation, half lives
of both radioactive and chemical decay etc. it is still there.  My
understanding is the Love Canal stayed buried with little movement of
contaminates until the clay cap was breached by subsequent development years
later.

True but we are not talking relativistic or even near relativistic speeds.
We are talking about surface impact or atmospheric breakup of a medium sized
object larger than a box car, smaller than a super tanker full of
radioactive material.

Quite correct from a scientific view point but I was talking, at least in
part, about the social results.  Picture the political/economic results on a
populace who think in terms of radioactivity as leprosy.   Any contact in
their minds means unclean, Unclean, UNCLEAN.   It becomes common knowledge
that its coming and everyone downs tools and heads for the shelters, picks
up rocks, bricks, clubs or what have you and takes apart the whatever
represents the threat or whatever offers revenge; or they try by what ever
means available to leave planet.   Instant political chaos no mater what the
actual degree of threat is.  If it hits the planet and becomes common
knowledge, even if it stays more or less intact, because of the political
consequences the place becomes a red or at least an amber zone.  People will
not want their products, because "it\'s tainted"  they won\'t want to visit
and they won\'t want people from the planet around, "He an ok fellow I guess
but would you want your sister to marry him?   The children could be mutants
you know."  Popular perception, fear,  prejudice,  not rational discourse
would rule.  Remember for most people radioactivity is the "the devil in the
dark".    It can\'t be seen or felt but it will "get you" or your children.
You can run but you can\'t hide from irrational fear.   These people have had
centuries of history in which nukes have been used in war, radioactive hot
zones perhaps a couple of centuries old on some planets.  They "know" the
consequences and they don\'t want "it to happen here" "not in my back yard"
becomes "not on my planet" thank you very much.

Its the old story. One planets toxic waste is another planets mother lode. It 
would seem to me that this might be a ready market for low tech industrial 
waste on higher tech worlds.

I\'m speaking as an ex-jeweler here. Platinum is hard to work with. Really
hard. Very hard. Did I mention it\'s quite difficult to work with?

If you want to "work" copper, you can do it with wooden tools, stone tools,
rawhide hammers, whatever. Personally, I think that once a culture developed
the tools to be able to work with platinum effectively (iron and more
specifically steel) those same tools would be better for whatever they
wanted to do. Of course, if they developed the technology to work steel, but
didn\'t have an abundance of iron... you could take it from there.

I imagine that decent tools and low-tech weapons could be made with platinum
though. It\'s nearly three times as heavy as iron, and though I\'ve never
tested it, I imagine it would keep a good edge. The problem is, of course,
is being able to work it effectively, and most importantly, being able to
melt it.

I\'m not up on the history of metallurgy, so I can\'t say at what TL a furnace
could be developed that could burn hot enough to melt platinum. Sorry that I
can\'t help you out there.

I hope this is somewhat useful to you.

No. However, watch out for cross sectional area, especially if
you use the long cylinder or needle hull types. As long as the weapons
are within 90% of the length of the hule, this should not be a problem.

Yes

This is unclear. Since the spinal mounts must have some sort of firing arc
then I would assume that as long as both targets are in arc, then yes.
However, that arc is not going to be very large. You might want to
consider putting the weapons into very large custom bays or (or even
turrets) for maximum flexibility.

Quote from:

http://www.shef.ac.uk/chemistry/web-elements/webelements/elements/text/index
/Pt.html

	The metal was used by pre-Columbian Indians but platinum was "rediscovered"
	in South America by Ulloa in 1735 and by Wood in 1741. In 1822 plenty of
	platinum was discovered in the Ural Mountains in Russia.

Sounds like TL 1-2

The properties of platinum suggest that it is somewhere between copper and
iron in strength and ductility.

That extra weight doesn\'t help, though it might make a good axe head.

The metal is roughly as ductile as silver. The platinum group metals
were only isolated in the 19th century, so minimum TL for a furnace is 3
or 4.

Platinum appears in only small amounts in the richest ore bodies on
Earth - roughly one gram of metal per 1000kg of ore.

A rich surface deposit would most likely be an old asteroidal impact
site.

Yes. So everyone knows where the stuff is.
Perhaps later on someone can dig it back up and turn it into something
useful (plentiful energy in the form of fusion power makes this easy).
Or you could sink wells into it and tap off methane perhaps. Or
introduce halophile or other extremophile bacteria to gently detoxify
it.

Some more info that may be of use :-
While the platinum group metals (including palladium, osmium, rhodium,
ruthenium, iridium) were isolated in the 19th century, small amounts
of metallic platinum were found by the conquistadores in South America.

Platinum was called \'platina\', Spanish for \'little silver\'. It was felt
to be unripe gold, and often thrown away!

A trick for lowering the melting point to that of iron or thereabouts
was first described in Europe by a French jeweler named Janety that I
think flourished in pre-Revolutionary times.

Platinum arsenates have a much lower melting point than pure metal (and
a distinct deep blue-black colour) ; one can imagine the noxious arsenic
oxides that must have tainted M. Janety\'s workshop!

If one uses this scenario, I would recommend using TNE rules (if
available).  That way, one can use Twilight: 2000 (ver 2.2) character

The poster was using "mine" as a verb, not a noun. He meant that a

If it\'s tidally locked, then it\'s day/night period is equal to it\'s orbital
period around the GG. _First In_ gives the formula P=sqrt(R^3/M) P= orbital
period in days, R is the orbital radius (in miles) and M = combined mass of
the pair, in Earth Mass = 1 units. There is a sidebar discussing this, on pp
62-63 of _First In_.

Platinum is actually not very ductile at all, which is why it\'s not used more
in jewelry and suchlike (in fact, the only sush use is as white gold, a
platinum/gold alloy). It\'s unlikely that native platinum could be used like
copper was. This is also one reason that platinum wasn\'t considered very
valuable until other properties of the metal, such as it\'s utility in
catalysis, were found.

It\'s a considerably less complex system. I\'m not sure of an environment where
hexapodal megafauna would have a distinct advantage. Perhaps in higher
gravity, or lower. Insects live in a very different environment than we
do...due to their vastly higher strength:weight ratios, and the unyielding (to
beings of their size and weight) environment in which they live. They\'re more
likely to get in situations where gravity doesn\'t help them stay where they
want to, so the added mechanical complexity of three sets of legs are needed
for traction and/or anchorage.

About the most that higher organisms have developed here are prehensile tails.
These are quite advanced and strong grasping appendages, and again, are
present in animals with high strength: weight ratios, such as many New World
monkeys, which live in arboreal environments where gravity isn\'t a friend.

Well, without going into the computer/cyber/the 3I is too lowtech
flamepit hell _again_, I\'d suggest that they think that fission power is
quaint and dirty, sort of like how we view old fashioned steam engines
belching great clouds of smoke. With the advent of cheap fusion power,
just about _every_ other source of energy becomes sidelined.

At a guess, the 3I feels about cyberwear as \'leprosy\', given it\'s
scarcity in the OTU. High-int robotics are probably viewed the same way.

It won\'t take but a couple of worlds grey-gooed to death to make
nanotech a _real_ dirty word.

running three tournaments as usual. There\'ll also be the usual plethora of

Actually, dumping stuff into a star is fairly difficult. To start with,
you need to kill the load\'s tangential velocity (orbital velocity)
*precisely*. It won\'t take much to turn that "impact" orbit into a near
miss which means that orbit later there\'s a nasty cloud of crud back
out there.

And just about every waste ever generated has *eventually* turned out
to be worth reprocessing for something. So instead of wasting 30-40
km/s of delta-V on trying to hit the star, invest maybe 10 km/s in
moving it to a generally useless asteroid or moon. If anybody ever
wants the stuff, it\'s there. And in the meantime it\'s a *long* ways

Roughly the same as it\'s orbital period around the GG. Just like the
day night cycle on *our* moon. 

For example, I seem to recall the day night cycle on Ganymede being
something like 3 or 4 days.

If you are on the side of the moon that faces the GG, you\'ll likely
have an "eclipse" of moderate duration at noon. The GG will be *much*
bigger than the sun though. So it\'ll be obvious, even to natives, that
the sun is going *behind* the GG.

"Native" platinum is found as a mix of platinum, iridium, osmium and
related metals. Ductile it ain\'t. You could possibly bang it into
shape, but it\'d be a *lot* harder than working copper. 

As far as I know, we weren\'t able to melt platinum until at least thye
late 1700s. I recall accounts of Spanish Conquistadores tossing
"silver" idols into melting pots and being amazed when they just sat
there!

Yep. Free-swimming fishes. It turns out that two sets of paired fins
(front and back) is both necessary and sufficient for maneuvering. When
amphibians developed from lungfish, the fins evolved into feet. 

A "middle" pair of fins would be wasted on a fish, so it\'s *really*
unlikely to survive as a trait long enough to make it to the land
animal stage, which is the first place it might be of use. 

The other "multi-legged" species are pretty much restricted to "near
water" or small size because of things like exoskeletons. So, sad to
say, centauroid aliens are unlikely except as the result of *major*
genetic manipulation somewhere along the line.

Yes. The various elements in the *food* have to come from *somewhere*.
There\'s *not* that much organic material in soil. And even less usable
nitrogen compounds. 

And colonies on airless rocks need to do *something* with sewage after
recovering the water from it. If processed properly, they\'ll have a dry
material that can be compressed into blocks and shipped easily (once
wrapped). Of course you use radiation to sterilize it.

Most of the stuff you are paying for food with is likely to be high
mass, low volume materials like metals, ores, gems, etc. So you can
carry a lot of *high* volume, *low* mass dried sludge and still have a
cargo worth more than enough.

Frankly, I expect that both the Ag colony and the mining colony would
*prefer* that the waste gets carried back.

Actually, I think it\'ll be a rather exceptional case when *ore* is
carried between planets. It costs little to reduce the ore to metal,
ans shipping the metal is better than shipping the ore. 

Slag isn\'t neccessarily going to get produced the way it was in the
past. I think you\'ll find that the "wastes" will be a lot lower in
volume. I also expect that unless there\'s a *use* for them elsewhere,
they\'ll at most get hauled to some useless rock in the same system.

Well, waste reprocessing is one of the reasons that Traveller can\'t
really work. Given the available power levels and fusion technology,
it\'d be practical to break *any* sort of waste into its component
elements.

My point is then a fortiori.  The original facts were "one planet next
to another one"; that could mean in the same star system or different
systems.  Once you\'re going to the expense of getting the waste off one
planet, why not send it into the star?  Why either carry to another
planet in the same system (and spend labor and other costs making a safe
landing) or jump it to another system (with even greater labor and other
costs for a week in jump)?  The answer is that whatever is extracted
from the waste is valuable enough to justify the expense of a round trip
(either off-planet or out-system) plus processing, and of course the
volumes coming back will be smaller than those going out.

Really, we need too be more specific about what we are getting rid of in order to
say it would be simple and certain to burn it. Some chemicals undergo strange

Yeah! Remember earlier I mentioned those microbes living at 240 F, ingesting
uranium and sulfur and what-not, then excreting gold and more what-not? Combine
that tenacity of life with bio-engineered waste-processing critters! I know the
3I is less advanced in biotech than the Solomani, but they are way above "us"
"now".

Good query, and what about the same for the Sword Worlds, Aslan Hierate, Hivers,
Darrians, Zodhani, etc?
